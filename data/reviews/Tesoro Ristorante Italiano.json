{"text":"This is our second time at that restaurant. I love the location, not too far. The food there is affordable, flavourable and tasty. And the service has been great. The waitress was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Food, service, and atmosphere were absolutely excellent! Run by a family with heart and soul. Definitely a \"Jewel in the Crown\" of Italian dining."}
{"text":"This place has the best Italian food with house made fresh marinara sauce and pasta.  The escargot appetizer is to die for.  I love seafood, however it's rare to find a restaurant in Scottsdale that uses fresh ones.  Tesoro's seafood combo linguine is just outstanding.  The veal dishes are so delicious... actually everything we have tried so far is simply amazing (for dessert the Tiramisu is a must).. It does get a bit crowded during peak dinner hours.  We usually get take out if we don't feel like dressing up and making reservations."}
{"text":"3 stars is being generous.  Went to Tesoro tonight with my husband and two teenagers based on the glowing yelp reviews.  It is a very small restaurant, 9 - 10 tables with a small waiting area out in front, facing the strip mall parking lot.  We had a reservation for 7:30.  Arrived on time and were apologetically told that our table was not yet ready.   Had to wait out front for 20 minutes shivering.  After we were seated, drink, wine, and appetizer orders taken, we relaxed and began to settle in.  Problem was, it is a very loud room. Conversation was a challenge.  Looking around, we realized that we were the youngest table in the room.  Average age appeared to be 60+ years old. Oh, well, young and hip it is not.  Hopefully the food is good. Bruschetta and antipasto were tasty.  For entrees, we ordered the homemade Fettuccine Bolognese, Spaghetti al Pomodoro, the Chicken Saltimbocca and a special, Farfalle with shrimp and asparagus.  Flavors were good, not great, but none of the pasta was homemade.  Very much a disappointment.  On the upside, service was very attentive and friendly.  Unfortunately, food is only mediocre, and the strip mall location is a definite detraction in size and ambiance.  Would I return again?  No."}
{"text":"We were in Scottsdale for a meeting and wanted to get away from the hotel food. What a great little find! I had the mushroom artichoke ravioli and my husband had the lasagna. Homemade pasta that melts in your mouth! Reminiscent of our trips to Italy. My husband sopped up the sauce with the homemade bread. Impressive wine list for such a little place, too. I only wish we had enough room to try the homemade Limoncello."}
{"text":"Small, elegant, romantic and affortable italian restaurant! 5/5  We didn't find out about Tesoro until about a week ago. Went there for J's birthday. We didn't feel like dressing up for a fancy meal but still wanted to have some good soul italian food. So we ended up at Tesoro that night. It was our first time there and we totally love that place! We shared a steamed mussels dish in tomato sauce and I had an amazing seafood pasta dish (~$24). Amazing finding! Would definitely put that on our fav list."}
{"text":"Another sumptuous meal, with appropriately attentive service by Keila!! We also enjoy the intimate atmosphere - almost as if a very hospitable friend invited you to a meal in their home! If you haven't dined here yet, it is definitely worth checking out !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a family owned business. They will custom order anything you want. I go there every week for take out if we don't want to go out.I highly recommend plus the prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"Yummmmm .... so authentic   This is one of the few mom & pop's type of restaurant in N Scottsdale that taste oh so authentic and fantastic  This is by far my favorite italian restaurant in town, way better than the big chain like Brios (don't get me wrong, they are not bad either)  It is not a fancy place but very cozy. And it does make you feel like you walk into one of the ristorante in Italia .... the owners are 100% italiano and they only use the freshest ingredients ....  I had the best lasagna there, you can taste the texture of the noodle, the creamy-ness of the chess, the meat favor and the freshness of the tomatoes... totally awesome.  Had tried the seafood linguine there too .... oh so good as well and with plenty of seafood ... definitely 2 thumbs up.   During winter, make sure you make reservation ahead though .... this place seems to be snowbirds' favorite too"}
{"text":"went there the other night and could not believe how horrible the food was. the original management knew what they were doing, but present management has no clue. the pasta sauce tasted like ketchup and the pasta was inedible. otherwise the food was great;  not!"}
{"text":"Family owned and in my neighborhood. Everything, and I mean everything, is delicious here! Get in the car right now and go there! Try the manicotti or chicken piccata or the mussels...yum!"}
{"text":"Was on vacation with a friend and her family in fountain hills, and we had a taste for Italian food and stumbled on this restaurant. It was amazing to say the least! For my friend's family who is used to eating all American food, they were really wowed by this one. Very authentic and the owners are super nice & service was great. Call ahead of time for reservations because it's a very small place & get ready to be a bit cozy in there."}
{"text":"Finally found great Italian food! Moved to the West Valley a year ago (where there is NO good Italian fare), so we ventured to Scottsdale and filled our bellies at Tesoro. It was like being transformed to Boston's North End, with some of the best Italian food in the land.  Tesoro has a very small, but inviting dining room. White tablecloths and a very attentive staff.   Soup of the day was a flavorful potato and leek soup. For some reason I was expecting a cream based soup, but was not disappointed with the beautifully seasoned broth.  My husband's lasagna was exceptional, decent portion served steamy hot. My fettucine bolognese was another ample portion of homemade noodles and a delicious meat sauce. Somehow we left room for dessert and indulged ourselves with a cannoli for me and the special dessert of the day for hubby. Mine was \"okay\" but would not order again. Special dessert was a crepe filled with marscapone cheese and blueberries. Wonderful tasting with a bit of citrus flavor. We declared it to be the best blueberry blintz we'd every had!  The place got very busy quickly on a Monday night. Reservations are needed for weekend.  Don't miss Tesoro -- it was well worth the drive from the other side of the valley!"}
{"text":"We live very close to this little gem in the Ancala Village Shopping Center.  Yes, it's small, and when the snowbirds are in residence, it can be tight seating, but its bistro feel and wildly fresh food make it worth it.  We like to eat early anyway, so we've never had a problem.    Having just moved permanently from CT to Scottsdale, we tried Tesoro after a year's hiatus.  The new owners delivered delicious meals and to-die-for hot Italian bread to my husband and me, and though our server Fabio was a bit quiet at first, once we got talking, he was warm and friendly.    We loved the chicken and veal parmigiana; my salad (including the tangy dressing) was fantastic.  We'll try other entrees next time.  Plenty of parking available."}
{"text":"Great, small, family owned. A true gem! It is not often that the people involved (the owners) are out talking with the patrons and asking about the meal. You can tell they really care."}
{"text":"I would put their food up against the best in Chicago. The sauce was exquisite, personal service, and great ambiance. You won't go wrong!!!!  Bon appetite."}
{"text":"Gnocchi - 5 Spaghetti and meatball - 5 Tiramisu - 5 Bread - 4 Kids-meal friendly - 1 ($14 for the spaghetti and $4 more for the meatballs is not an affordable kids meal but they do NOT have a kids menu though the dish can be shared) Atmosphere - 5  Unfortunately, they are not open for lunch or I'd be back next weekend"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  First I was sat at a table that was back to back with another person....we are talking 3 inchs apart. I dont like sitting that close to another group.....this place is tiny.  Bread was plain old italian bread...not warm Served with some olive oil...no pepper or spice....boring,  Salad arrived....dressing was good....salad was ok....until I got the bill....$7....what a joke. I thought this place was a $$ not a $$$.  Entree arrived. I got the cannelloni, pretty tasty meat filling and alfredo sauce. I like alfredo over marinara so I had them substitute it.....but I wasnt told that I would be charged $2.....another joke....been to may places and never charged to sub a sauce. My girl got the beef stew over rigatoni.....she liked it.   Dessert. Pistachio gelato with a piece of biscoti Tasty....another $7  Toward the end of the meal the service slowed down to a stop and I stopped getting drink refills...no big deal as they were closing.  So a recap.... $4 for drinks $14 for some tiny salads $34 + $2 for entrees with a different sauce.......dot dot dot $7 for 4oz of gelato add some tax and a $12 tip...you get.... $78....wont happen again."}
{"text":"Visiting relatives that recommended Tesoro's. We had a fabulous meal. For those who enjoy eggplant parm, they serve the best. The eggplant is baked not fried. If you are looking for a nice quaint great Italian meal...enjoy Tesoro's."}
{"text":"So delish!  I have been wanting to go here for years and we finally went just as I am about to move to Portland!  Anyways it was so good.  We got the bruschetta and the scallops as an app.  The scallops were superb, perfectly cooked.  I got the penne putanesca, which was also really good.  To finish off the awesome meal we had the bread pudding.  All in all it was a great meal and I will definitely be returning when I come to visit my family in Arizona."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!  Small, yes. But make a reservation and you always get a table.  Love the food!!"}
{"text":"I was a regular customer because, as the other reviews note, the food is good. But  my last visit was my last.  I made reservations for four several days in advance. When I arrived every table was full, most without food. I was told it would be 20-30 minutes. In other words they ignored my reservation- a regular customer- and  seated other people at my table.   If this is the kind of service you enjoy, then this is the place for you. Me- I went to the Italian restaurant across the street, Vitos. Maybe not quite as good but a lot more respectful of their customers."}
{"text":"Live only a few blocks from this place and have visited thru its various management changes. This last visit was the worse. My wife and I were the only ones in the restaurant and it took 30 minutes to get our appetizers! Which wasn't the freshest...the entrees sauce (tomato) was so acidic that we couldn't eat it and decided to take it home to season ourselves. - long story short. There are plenty of good Italian restaurants in Scottsdale, this one needs a tune up."}
{"text":"In town for a wedding and staying in N. Scottsdale...  Hungry one evening and wanting Italian, we turned to Yelp for help!  Reading reviews of places for the area I found two things about Tesoro's that immediately caught my eye from the other reviews... \"delicious gnocchi\" & \"best gnocchi\"... my mind was made up!  The wine list was extensive, we had a very nice Pinot Grigio.  The menu begged for ordering one of everything... but we settled on two appetizers, two entrees and two deserts. (for the *two* of us, those were six hard decisions ;-))  I ordered the special which came with a choice of pasta or veggies but I substituted... wait for it... yep, gnocchi. I made a special request of the kitchen for a sauce that wasn't on the menu... nothing in particular, just something that the chef would like to have over their gnocchi and would play well with the special, and wow, that's all i can say, they blew my socks off.   Our waitress was the icing on the cake... I personally think the waitstaff of a restaurant can make a good meal great, or even break a great meal... Janet was the 5th star in my rating of Tesoro's.  We'll be in Sedona in September... and we will be making a special trip back to Scottsdale just for another meal here.  We absolutely loved this place!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian place/food ... The real deal! It's tucked away off Via Linda in strip mall by Safeway."}
{"text":"What a gem! Best italian food in the Valley. Great service, fantastic Gnocchi, Eggplant Parmiggiano, Ravioli... Real espresso with the biscotti. The bottle of Gaja was a great compliment to this fabulous exprience. I felt like I was in Italy. Loved it. Grazie!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices!!  Try this place out for an intimate delicious meal!  Took a business group of 10, and had great service and great food, would totally recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Italian food. Family owned and run. Best Teramisu I've ever had."}
{"text":"Simply amazing lasagne. The best I've ever had. Additionally, the special tonight was fish piccata. My wife said this was probably the best dish she's ever had. Period. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Food good and well prepared. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. I ordered linguine w/white clam sauce. It would have been outstanding except for too much salt. Pasta al dente. The menu is uninspired and without greens such as rapini, broccoli rabe. My favorite Italian dish, pasta w/sausage and rapini or some similar dish were nowhere to be found. No sausage w/peppers. No soup such as  pasta fagoli or minestrone. Still, good, simple plain food, reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This restaurant is great!  I went with my husband during the middle of the week and it was nearly full.  It is a small, comfy restaurant in a strip mall.  Sometimes strip mall locations scare people off but they shouldn't; that is where you find the hidden gems.  The Waitress was sweet and I asked her about the pasta being homemade and she was telling us the Matriarch of the restaurant still cooks but does a lot of the oversight now.  The restaurant is family run with her husband, their kids and their nieces and nephews.  I didn't hear any family yelling in the kitchen, which you should would if my family had a business.  My husband had the lasagna which was great.  He didn't leave a drop and I had the gnocchi that had a light tomato cream sauce on it, not heavy like you frequently see.  The gnocchi were the perfect texture.  The bread they served was great too with some nice EVOO on it.  We asked for more.  I would come back here in a minute.  Oh, and the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"I wouldn't waste my time or money going to this place again. We purchased a Groupon and made reservations for a Saturday night at 7:30. We sat down and the server took our drink order, there where 4 of us. Server brought drinks out in a couple of minutes she had no idea what kind of vodka they had for martinis. We place an order for appetizer and placed our dinner order. 40 minutes later the server came to table and said she forgot to place our appetizer order. After 45 minutes of waiting we finally got our appetizer. It's now 9:15 pm and we still didn't get our dinner order my wife went up to the waitress and said we would like our check. The cook, only one person cooking which was the owner, said our dinner would be ready in the next 5 to 10 minutes we left. And very disappointed with the level of service we received, would never go back"}
{"text":"This is the real deal, homemade Italian food. A real Italian family making great Italian food. I had the Chicken Marsala in a mushroom and sweet wine sauce  with a side  vegetables. No kidding I could eat here everyday.  To all of these other so called Italian restaurants with kids making minimum wage in the kitchen take note. The Owner actually knows how to cook, not just order underpaid  kids around and collect money.   This is where other restaurant owners go when they want good food. Gratzi!!"}
{"text":"Great food  Special attention because of a birthday Recommend it Original dessert chocolate deep fried strawberry"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere were wonderful! Our waiter was lovely and helpful. The wine was perfect. I had no idea we were in a strip mall parking lot. The portions were smaller than expected."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Tesoro tonight and were not impressed.  Tomato, mozzarella and basil salad - tomatoes were not the best quality and  had hard centers, no excuse for that this time of year.  Mozzarella was fair, I've had freshly made mozz from spectacular Italian delis and this was not at that level of taste/quality.  Scallop appetizer - portion was good, nicely seared, good pesto, taste was decent.  Tortellini - pasta was nice, prosciutto was cut too thick which made it chewy and I hit a couple of fatty pieces that were like gum, sauce was bland and a little floury.  I did love the bread included with the meal.  Overall, I would say everything was fine - not memorable, just fine.  I will try Tesoro again, maybe we hit an off night."}
{"text":"Just wasn't impressed. This place used to be so good a few years ago. Ownership change that I was not aware of. Does not feel freshly made. Desert cake so dry they tried to bring it back to life with microwave. Enough said."}
{"text":"WOW.......thought about going to Maggiano and said we wanted a change. Holy cow.......glad we did. It was busy and DA..... no reservation so ended up out side....not bad. But when the entrées came out.....so OK....never had ravioli this well prepared a taste so remarkable. We're hooked and can't wait to come back to try something new. Thanks for the experience"}
{"text":"You will not find a better Italian restaurant in Arizona. This family owned and operated eatery is simply amazing from start to finish. Chefs Sonia and Tony DiFranco execute their menu to perfection. Their wine list is unique, affordable and offers something for everyone. You need to try the butter nut squash ravioli (you will not be disappointed). They unfortunately close during the month of July, so you will have to wait until August to enjoy everything the DiFranco family has to offer."}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent on all accounts! Every time I'm in town, I always make a trip to Tesoro.  The food never disappoints, doesn't matter what you order, it will be flavorful and appetizing.  The service is unparalleled, the owners are the sweetest people you will ever meet, they always come out from the kitchen to chat, give \"besos\", and ensure the food was well received.   Give this place a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 stars is the service. Very slow with the man we had. Dirty dishes left on the table, asked for our bottle of wine twice before we got it. The food was outstanding everything from scratch. The mussels were in a sauce so good I could have had that and bread alone!! Very small space, make reservations. Will go back!"}
{"text":"If you like great food, a place where the owner and his family are hands on, and a perfect place for relaxing date night, then look no further.  This is a favorite of mine. Its small, serves up fresh food and they take special request.  This is not just a great restaurant, it's a place you can relax and be served like you are a VIP.    And no, I am not related to any of the owners.  I've been there 4 times and it's always been a great experience.  They earned this stellar review."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner here tonight.  Service was outstanding and food delicious.  Big shout out to our waiter Alan who was extremely personable and helpful."}
{"text":"We started with the scallop appetzer and enjoyed that. My entree was the seafood pasta and it also was very nice. The problem is the newly hired staff and how long it took for everything. Ordered wine but after looking at my receipt I was given a different wine then what I ordered. Tried to order a second glass of wine with my meal but it never appeared. Desserts were not that good. Wife had a canneloi that tasted like it was made in bad oil.  Dinner took 1 1/2 hours."}
{"text":"I rarely wright a review but I feel the need to let people know something. My wife and I went here for dinner ordered a bottle of wine with dinner and a few desert drinks. After about an hour and a half the waitress comes over and tells us her manager asked her to tell us she needs to turn the table and other people are waiting! Really! I grew up in Chicago have been to thousands of restaurants and I never been asked to leave. We spent $120 only to be thrown out. I understand the place is small and seating is limited but isn't there a better way to let people know they need the table. The food was ok. I guess it's great if you have never been to an Italian restaurant east of the Mississippi."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere - small, quaint, and well appointed.  Good to excellent food quality and fair to good food quantity depending on the dish.  Eggplant parm was excellent, chicken saltimbocca very good, and veal piccata mediocre.  Not very kid friendly (charged an 8 year old $10 for a simply bowl of spaghetti with tomato sauce, as there is no kid's menu).  I wish I had tried Tommy V's Urban Kitchen...similar menu, but more variety for kids at fair prices."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the high prices, I'd probably give this place 2 stars.  I went with 2 other people, and we did not order liquor, just an appetizer, and 3 dishes, and we walked out of there disappointed, and spent $140.  NOTE: I was facing the kitchen and could see the chef.  For a place that charges $20-35 per plate, you'd expect the pasta to be cooked to order (only takes 10-11 minutes!).  However, the pasta was precooked, but heated up in a pan with the sauces to order.  Any pasta dish from Cheese Cake factory is way better than anything on this menu -- and half price.   For the appetizer, we got 4 scallops. Scallops were smaller than we expected on a bed of pesto.  They were alright, nothing special.  We then ordered 3 dishes, Osso Buco (special), Linguine with sea food combo, and chicken marsala with linguine.  Osso Buco - this was a $35 item, so we had high expectations.  It came on a bed of risotto.  I could see the chef cook from where I was sitting.  The risotto had to be scrapped off the pan, and it was noticeably dry.  The beef was not tender, and clearly needed to be cooked more.  If you've had osso buco anywhere decent, you know it's supposed to almost fall off the bone.  Chicken Marsala had no flavor.  I thought there wasn't enough sauce, so I asked for more sauce, but the sauce was very thin and watery, and just lacked flavor.    The 3rd dish was also OK -- probably the better out of the three.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this restaurant after reading reviews but was terribly disappointed. We had 3 in our party and arrived at 6pm . Only 2 other tables seated at this time. Waiter took our orders ( without writing) . We ordered 3 starters and 3 entrees. One of the salads were not as ordered. When the entrees came we were again given one that was not orderd. They really need to get their act together. The food was totally underwhelming. They offered to take an entree off of bill .When check arrived they stated that they DID charge for 3 entrees but took off 2 glasses of house wine insead. Will not return."}
{"text":"We arrived at about 5pm on a recent Saturday...felt as if no A/C was on,only one another party of four in the restaurant and they wanted to seat us next to the door so we could get blasted by the 112 degree temps each time the door opened.  We requested to be seated elsewhere so they seated us right in front of the kitchen.  What I did not like was the entire restaurant staff standing together in such a small space 4 feet from our table the entire meal.  Food was mediocre at best with little flavor.  Too many italian restaurants to explore that are not in a strip mall and offer more room and better food.  Go to Vito's; much better"}
{"text":"A small family owned and run Italian resturant.  Great food, service and wines.  The menu is varied with daily specials.  The chef is Dad & daughter, Mother is the Maitre' D, daughter and brother servers.  Have been going there since it opened and have never been the least bit disapointed.  Must call for reservations.  Come and get spoiled. Best in the valley! For me best in country!"}
{"text":"We went here for the first time this past weekend, though we have hear about we have never been. We got there on a sat night  following thanksgiving.  It's very charming and quaint, maybe 15 tables at most. It was not to crowded which made it nice, the server was great, very nice and accommodating. The food was fantastic, very authentic Italian, I had the penne with chicken, artichoke and mushrooms but I had it with the vodka sauce and it was amazing. My wife had the same same dish and she too loved it. Prices are very fair and portion sizes was generous. The ambience is simple but nice and they have a  nice wine selection.  We will definitely come back!  Patrick  Scottsdale Az"}
{"text":"Just went there tonight for dinner and we had a great time.  The food was very good and the service was great. We went with our two kids ages 3 and 8 and they were very comfortable and the staff treated them very well so no problem for kids at all... they even made half portions for the kids. Very difficult to get a reservation with little notice so call days in advance."}
{"text":"Quaint little place that features all homemade pasta. We ordered the fettuccine bolognese, cannelloni, chicken Marsala, chicken piccata and meatball appetizer. Everything was delicious, but gave them four stars because of portion size. The fettuccini was the only dish that was a really good sized portion. The others we completely finished, but would have liked a little more of.   Bread that came with the meal was warm and fresh baked. What a treat.   A little disappointed there was no cannoli cake, as seen on Yelp pics."}
{"text":"Having been here before I expected to see \"mama\", the owner of Tesoro.  But I didn't see her.  Then the second clue came.  The homemade bread which I was served in a prior visit, was not in the bread basket.  This was mama's homemade bread.  Missing in action.  Then it became real to me.  The restaurant had been sold when I wasn't looking.  No more mama.    I ordered Pasta Puttanesca which I always adored.  Hubby had to get more complicated.  He ordered something which was not on the menu.  I said don't do it-- you will pay through the nose as the basic dishes are not inexpensive.  He insisted and ordered chicken cutlet with eggplant with sauce--no cheese.  So here's the story.  The waiter, Alan, brings this large dish to hubby with his requested dish.  Kinda large.  Hubby tasted and loved it.  I said, let me have a taste and it was really, really, really, really good.  I mean good.  My puttanesca pasta not so much.  Anchovies--check.  Capers--check, pasta al dente--check; but somehow the pasta did not come together as a dish. I think it was the sauce-- It just wasn't there like before.  Something missing.  Don't know what.  I would not order this pasta again.  But hubby's custom dish was amazing.  It was amazing until we got the bill.  That amazing dish was $28 plus tax and tip by itself.  That's a lot of mula for one chicken dish.  Yikes.  Really, you customize something and it is double the price of your regular dishes?  Holy moly!  I told hubby he was going to pay through the nose.  But he says he enjoyed it immensely.  We have learned our lesson.  Ask for a price before you customize a dish.  (I thought it would be tacky to do such a thing, but apparently it's the way to go unless you want a REAL surprise at the end of your meal.)"}
{"text":"Came from San Diego to try Tesoro and was soo happy I did.  Most important the meatballs.... They were bomb.com really really good!!!!!  Had cucumbers and tomatoes for appetizer was nice.    Main meal was chicken parm with side of spaghetti. It was delicious.  Service was great, nice environment, and prices were standard. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This Italian is a must in north Scottsdale. The homemade pasta is incredible and the wait staff is so friendly. Very homey here."}
{"text":"We went here given the good reviews (4.5 stars) and desire for some good Italian food for dinner. This seems like a 'love it' or 'don't love it' place.  We wanted to love it, but it's just ok. You walk into a small, family run restaurant with only 12-15 tables and white table clothes. Good start, but as the restaurant fills up - it gets noisy and the tables are very close together. Hard to have a private conversation.  Service level is good and the menu has plenty of choice for any one.  Sadly, the food is just ok. Most of the items are presented nicely, but lack flavor/taste. We had 4 different items and they were each just ok, not bad, just ok.  We really wanted to like this spot as it is near our home and we love Italian food, but we will try some other spots first before going back."}
{"text":"We were amazed! With so many acceptable reviews we had to try. Always looking for a new good restaurant. This was absolutely horrible! Service was fine, decor nice, food was microwaved, over cooked, over hot, and tasteless.  Never again!"}
{"text":"So happy to have discovered this place! Really good food, and a lovely unpretentious atmosphere. The Saltimboca was fantastic.  Will be  back to try many other dishes."}
{"text":"Family owned Italian spot with delicious tiramisu. Small, friendly and quaint."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is exceptional and food is always delicious. We had the swordfish special and the veal parmigiana entrees. Passed on soup etc as I wanted to save room for dessert. Excellent decision. Enjoyed pumpkin spice cake with a cappuccino. We've enjoyed coming here for years but realize we need to do so more often."}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I'd be there every week!  The shrimp diavolo is my absolute favorite!  Tell Filomena that Campus Flowers sent you!  They are usually pretty busy so call ahead to make a reservation.  Desserts are awesome too."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best Italian restaurants in Scottsdale!  Everything is homemade with fresh ingredients.  Staff is very fast, attentive, and friendly!  Kudos to the owner!  I had the chicken penne w artichokes and mushroom in a wine cream sauce.  It was perfect.  My husband had the seafood combination linguine and loved it!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! Between the house made pasta and the perfectly tender veal piccata...I'm not sure where I found room in my stomach. The service and food were top notch...don't be fooled by it's location and neighbors, the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Smaller atmosphere made it more authentic Italian service and the food was excellent.   Home made pasta melted in our mouth and the service was attentive and efficient.   Price was affordable yet cuisine was too end.  Definitely worth going out of the way for this little gem."}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my husband and my local favorites. The atmosphere is comfortable and the owners very gracious. Their food is always carefully prepared and delicious. It is Italian comfort food at it's best. My favorite dish is artichoke/mushroom ravioli. Excellent Italian wine list, too.  It is small and in a strip mall so easy to miss. Take the extra effort to drive into the parking area near the Safeway's on Via Linda to find it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After being a little nervous of the \"new ownership\" comments I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious our meal was here!   A colleague and I came here for dinner while in town on business. This meal was just what we needed. A comforting home cooked meal. They make ALL of their pasta in house including 3-4 different types of a ravioli.   We were also impressed by a bottle of a Tuscan wine that we ordered. I'm fairly certain (in looking around at other tables) that whatever you order will be delicious and you can't go wrong. I will definitely return to this restaurant every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Best gnocchi I've had outside of Italy! Only issue is that the place is small and frequently jammed. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing little taste of Italy in a strip mall, this place is small and so good , I've been here several times never disappoints.. Always forget to leave them a review.. Just had a wonderful dinner the other night with friends,  the veal parmesan was great !  crispy on the edges , love it that way.. nice smooth sauce not overpowering , perfect portion, not many places I consider eating veal these days, everything they do is top notch! you are almost seated in the kitchen it's like eating at someone's house. Don't bother with the big Italian places, make a reservation and treat yourself to authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"Holly Mostacholli thats one great Fing restaurant.  Def eat here. I tried 5 dishes all great"}
{"text":"This restaurant is fantastic. Everything from the building, to the food, and the staff made this a very cozy and tranquil dinner location. The food was extremely delicious. I got the Bolognese and it tasted fresh, clean and surprisingly light. Simply amazing lasagne. The best I've ever had. Additionally, the special tonight was fish piccata."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this little restaurant was. We are here from Chicago for a few weeks and looked up restaurants on Yelp. Since we are staying close, Tesoro looked like a good choice.    It is small and cozy, and our service was friendly and helpful.  We shared the antipasto which was good, but a little too meat-heavy for me.  I had the ravioli with prosciutto,  peas, and walnuts.  The pasta was clearly hand made, and they were fresh peas!  Just wonderful.   My husband had the spaghetti with meatballs, and it was good, but nothing special.    We each took home about half and shared both dishes a couple of nights later.    We will be back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went here for dinner on a Monday night based on the reviews, and I'm happy to report that we were both very happy.  The ambiance is pleasant and what one would expect from such a restaurant, although the location in the strip mall is not ideal.  The place is small, with a bit of outdoor seating.  We found when the restaurant filled up, it was a bit noisy--being seated by the kitchen did not help this--but we were still able to converse without much distraction.   The high point here is the food.  I've found authentic italian to be a rarity in the valley, and I very much enjoyed our meal.  I found the menu very pasta-heavy, but the selection was excellent.  If you like italian food even the slightest bit, I imagine you'll find something on their menu that you'll enjoy.  As for me, I had the lasagna, and it was excellent, and I would certainly order it again.  The gnocchi my friend had were delicious--clearly hand made.  When I return, I'll have high expectations for the food.   Service was attentive without being overbearing.  I found interacting with one of the owners quite pleasant--it's always a bonus to see an owner on the floor caring about your experience. Reservations are probably a good idea any night people might be out.  I was surprised to find the place fairly busy on a Monday.  Well, I highly recommend Tesoro--I don't think I've had a better Italian meal in Phoenix."}
{"text":"It's super cute and intimate here.  It's a small space so reservations are recommended.  We had a party of 12 girls for dinner with particular palettes and everyone was pretty much satisfied.  I had the artichoke spinach ravioli in tomato cream sauce and it was excellent!  Some of the other very tasty dishes and appetizers were the scallops, bruschetta and mussels.  For dessert, the chocolate brownie w/ vanilla ice cream was a huge hit.  The only not so great thing was the creme brulee. It looked amazing on the outside but once we cracked open that beautiful shell it looked like someone had an accident inside.  It had a weird yellow drippy consistency and when we told our waitress, she looked at us like we were nuts and didn't know anything(or was that look cuz we were a group of 12 asian girls in Scottsdale??)  All in all, yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, quaint little restaurant & great service! They have good salads, their pastas are delicious & good sized portions.  When we get into town, this is amiss on our list.. it just feels like a little home town restaurant."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great little Italian place this is it.  Food is top notch, the service is friendly and caring, and the prices are reasonable. All the pasta dishes we have had have been great as have been the veal dishes.  We have never been disappointed in any of their wine recommendations as well.  Most of the times we have had to walk in we have been turned away so you should make a reservation first."}
{"text":"Took some friends who just moved here to Tesoro.  As always service was great and the food outstanding.  We had to wait while they made fresh mozzarella for our salad-wonderful!   All the meals were outstanding and the wine was luscious for the price.  Love the small, family atmosphere versus the typical large, noisy and slick interiors of some many places today."}
{"text":"Restaurant very small and very loud. Hostess extremely courteous.  Comparing food here to Il Fornio portions were small. I had the veal with linguine. For an extra charge of $4 the linguine portion was very small. Veal was excellent. My wife had linguine with claims muscles shrimp scallops and calamari. Just okay just not great.  It was my wife's birthday and restaurant didn't even offer a desert. My wife would have had coffee and I would have had espresso with it.  The wine I selected as very good.  Wouldn't go back. Food okay but nothing to write home about. Piped in music was very loud and restaurant was noisy to start with."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. This place is the bomb!!! Family owned. I believe the mom/grandma was on the kitchen cooking. Worth the wait for your food, that's how fresh their meals are. Ordered the manicotti, unreal. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Since my favorite Italian restaurant, Tesoro's, changed ownership last year, I have eaten there 3 times.  Each time was a little iffy but I wanted to give them a chance.  On the first visit, the Buschetta (our favorite) was served on burned, inedible bread.  It should not have been served to the table.   With the second visit, there was no bread.  My final and last visit to Tesoro's was to get take out.  My chicken piccata consisted of 2 thin yet tough pieces of chicken.  The two pieces together were the size of a deck of cards. It was served with overcooked pasta with red sauce.  Red sauce? really?  My husband found his lasagna disappointing as the noodles were over cooked and the lasagna lacked ingredients.  Sadly, this is our final visit to Tesoro's.  It is way too pricey for the food served."}
{"text":"A wonderful little Italian family owned restaurant with excellent food, service and atmosphere.  We went last night for our first time although they have been around for 13 years.  I'd suggest you make reservations because seating is limited.  Their hours are limited to only evenings for dinner.  I'll recommend to friends."}
{"text":"This place is very small and inviting. I had to wait for a little while for my table, but it was worth the wait. The Sea Scallops were amazing on the appetizer menu and I had the BEST Bolognase with HOMEMADE Fettuccine pasta - They actually made the pasta in house.  Wine list was great too - good mix. I will become a regular here for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood restaurant that serves fantastic food.  The dining experience was great.  The atmosphere, servers, and owner were all very welcoming and warm.  The mussels appetizer was amazing.  The veal marsala superb.   It was a unique tourist experience.    Before we left the restaurant on Thursday night, we made a reservation for Saturday.  It is a small restaurant - make a reservation."}
{"text":"This Place was recommended to me by friend, so I decided to give it a try. I went there with my wife, I ordered the Pollo Vitello, it was good! But what made me give this place 5 stars is our waitress was NICOLE, she is amazing person, great personality, with lovely smile, I will definitely ask for her on my next diner. Thanks Tesoro Ristorante for the great experience."}
{"text":"A very cozy place, romantic feeling. Perfect for date night.  Italian family owned and operated. It's not easy to find authentic tasting Italian food in the valley and my party of four drove far to see what the hype was about and I must say it didn't dissapoint! The wine list was wonderful and we decided to go with a bottle of Moscato from Italy. Fresh warm bread was ever present and our waters were frequently filled as well by our attentive waiter. We had veal marsala, spaghetti pomodoro, chicken pizzaola and the eggplant. All dishes were tasty, made from scratch with fresh ingredients and portion sized to European standard NOT the American standard which is not a bad thing considering a proper Italian meal has several courses. I liked being able to eat dessert for a change which was tiramisu and one of us had the chocolate martini which was super delish and very strong! I would love to try the tortellini or lasagna next time. The only gripe I had was that it felt very warm inside the restaurant and somewhat stuffy. Almost claustrophobic. I can't imagine eating there when it's at full capacity! We would've sat on the patio if it wasn't July!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner had a 6:15 reservation. When we arrived there were only 4 people at 2 tables one person was the hostess and server she was very nice we ordered veal parm ,muscles for appetizer.after a few minutes we were told that they ran out of veal.well I'm from New York and so I said this is an Italian restaurant and considering they just opened you didn't run out you never had she was in a bad spot and apologized we had to change our orders and changed to chicken parm. We also ordered drinks and the johnnie walker black that was ordered was not johnnie walker black but a lesser scotch. The chicken parm was awful. Surgary with canned sauce and a slice of cheese that didn't even cover the frozen chicken the pasta was watery and the sauce as said canned. before they sold the restaurant it was a gem fantastic mama and her family cooked some of the best Italian food in az.now it was close to dog food . I can not recommend this place at all I guarantee it will close after the season . if you don't have veal it means you don't have money to order it and so I don't believe you will be seeing this after season . This is first review I've ever written and I really am sorry I had to do this but it truly was horrible"}
{"text":"We literally were the only people in the place and that was fine with us.  Summer time you can expect that.  My wife and I split the escargot ravioli and they were excellent.  Loved the sauce they were in.  My wife had the seafood linguini and I had the linguine and clams.  We loved them both.    Only thing keeping this from a 5 star was nothing was extraordinary.  It was just very good.  Also service was just okay.  Young girl with little experience.  I do recommend this place for a nice quite romantic dinner with your spouse or significant other.  Nothing too crazy, just consistently good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Updated Review: Jake the owner contacted me right after my post and was very understanding of the details tonight instead of trying to be defensive. This is the right way to handle business and provide superior customer service. The original post I made is no longer there but there was an issue with a dish not being up to par."}
{"text":"Tesoros was recommended to me through a friend for my 2nd anniversary with my husband. I was told everyone was very nice and the food was \"unreal\". Tesoro's certainly lived up to the reputation. Not only was the food fresh and delicious, the staff was knowledgable, friendly, and even went the extra mile to put some rose petals on my table! It was so nice and we had such a wonderful time! I will definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Yelp steered us wrong this time. Sadly one of our few nights in Scottsdale was wasted during dinner here. Not only was it overpriced for what we received, but the service was not up to par for that price point. We were asked if we had reservations, which we did not, and she commented in a way that made us feel like we were intruding.  Mind you there was only one other table occupied in the whole restaurant! Our water was not refilled until 2 minutes before we left.  We were ignored for the entire meal. The specials were not offered until we asked. Anyway, to the food. The special of the day, fish, was priced at $30, came only with fish and four pieces of oil soaked asparagus, no starch included. Felt like an incomplete meal for thirty bucks!  The fish was overlooked and dry. The saltimboca was swimming in a weird looking gravy making appear like chicken fried steak ... weird.  This was a fail of a dinner and a not to be repeated experience. We've never felt so ignored for spending over $100 bucks for dinner."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp (of course) and decided to try it out.  It was a very intimate place with very friendly service and a good menu.  I was surprised at the absence of fresh ground black pepper and balsamic vinegar, but that could be just me not understanding how real Italian food is supposed to work :)   Everything we ordered was good.  The actual location wasn't the greatest, as I did have a green dollar tree neon sign in my view the entire time, but overall was a nice experience."}
{"text":"This. Place. Rocks.  I have to say that this is the best Italian I have had in a very long time.  Went with two colleagues, and we decided to make it a self styled sampler. Just came back, had to write the review.  We ordered the cannelloni filled with meat, baked with marinara and béchamel sauce (we asked, meat meant beef, sausage and perhaps veal, depended on the day), tortellini filled with cheese in a cream sauce with peas, prosciutto and toasted walnuts, chicken saltimbocca topped with prosciutto and mozzarella in a white wine and sage reduction with vegetable side.  All really were just amazing.  The cannelloni was not super rich, great combination of sauce, meat, pasta.  Tortellini was just yummy, sauce was right thickness, not too thick, not too runny, and chicken was cooked just right, very think scallopini style, great sauce, again the viscosity of the sauce was perfect.  Have to say also that the drink I ordered was one of the best brandy manhattan, straight up, two cherries, that i have had in some time.    Service was just right, and really liked that the chef/owner (not sure what her real deal was) came out to ask about the dishes.  Server was super nice, right amount of attentive.  Feeling sated and happy, reviews that sent me here were well deserved!"}
{"text":"My favorite ristorante italiano outside of Italy! My two fav reasons to come here is their gnocchi and lemoncello. Their gnocchi is the best I have ever had. It it not too potaoey and doughy like alot of gnocchi. It basically melts in your mouth and is heavenly. The vodka sauce they put over it is just as good. Tomato's, basil, cream and a ton of fresh cracked pepper which I love!  I order this dish ever time I go there because it is just that good. It's a great comfort food! They have alot of other great dishes like the eggplant parm. and of course the lasagna. I have heard that if you like tripe, its also very good here. Me, I tend to stay away from guts!  They make their own lemoncello and I finish every meal with this yummy digestif. Its not too strong and perfectly lemony. I love it!  I also love that this is a small quaint place. You def need reservations to get a table here since there are only like 15 tables here.  The friendly family that owns this place are from southern Italy and they def know how to cook and run a great restaurant. This is the one restaurant I will miss when I leave Scottsdale...."}
{"text":"This was a dinner for my 65th birthday with my wife, so we really were looking forward to an excellent Italian dinner. Unfortunately our experience was far less than enjoyable.   My wife ordered a veal Marcella, which she has enjoyed at many Italian restaurants. This dish at Tesoro tasted like the pepper shaker got dumped on top of her food. It almost tasted like a curry dish. My wife hardly ate any of the meal. She said it was the worst veal Marcella that she ever had. We talked with our waitress about the issues with the meal, but the only thing she did was buy one of ur glasses of wine. Any quality establishment would gave removed the meal from our bill.  The rest of our meal was unexciting. It took forever to even get our order.   We will not be going back to Tesoro any time soon.  The worst part, my wife blames herself for choosing this restaurant for my birthday. It was not her fault.  Stone and Vine in Scottsdale is much much better."}
{"text":"Rating 3.5 stars  Cute italian spot.  The food is pretty authentic, good selections on the menu, portions are good sizes (not too much nor too little).  I do not recommend the canneloni or creme brulee desserts.  The creme brulee was like pudding. The consistency was completely off and the canneloni was just bleh.  However, the chocolate brownie w/vanilla ice cream was yummy.  If I were in the area again and craving italian, I'd revisit this place."}
{"text":"We so enjoyed our evening here.  The place is in a non descript mall.  It's small but homey and Italian inside.  The waiters and staff in general are real Italians and that is reflected in their genuine food.  We loved la mamma who stopped by to see how we like our meal and to be sweet to our daughters.  The pasta is excellent and authentic but not as good as Andreoli or Trattoria Veneto.  I loved my entree which was Valdostana which is veal with a small slice of ham and cheese on top.  It was delicious and authentic.  We will be back for the warm atmosphere and welcome you get here and for very good food."}
{"text":"Love it, love it, love it. Family owned. Everyone is a pleasant as can be. Everyone I've taken there says it's the best Italian they have had."}
{"text":"This place has some really good food. It's a small restaurant, so everything is pretty intimate. The waitress we had was very friendly and funny; made us feel very welcome. I got the mushroom artichoke ravioli & my bf got the tortellini minus the prosciutto. Both super delicious. Also they had a $28 dollar bottle of champagne that got the job done lol. All in all I'd return to this place, I enjoyed my meal and experience A lot. They also had really good music playing!"}
{"text":"Service was slow to start and appeared disorganized.  The sauce for the mussels and pasta was outstanding but the protein portions were a bit small. Service improved as the night went on.  Groupon deal was good to try it out and recommend that offer."}
{"text":"Our first time there was in March 2015, and the food and service were both good. So we came back again today, Sunday night, for a light dinner, and it was very disappointing! We liked the appetizer, antipasto, last time, so we ordered it again today.The prosciutto was tough and thick, the salami was terrible. We only ate a quarter of the antipasto, and it should be obvious enough that we didn't like it! We also let the waiter know that the cut of the prosciutto was way too thick... We got four pieces of new thinner cuts as a replacement, but they were still tough! So the conclusion was the quality itself was bad! Over the course we ordered 3 glasses of wine, split a pasta (since we were not hungry, but it was pedestrian!!!!), and ended with creme brûlée! We still spent a decent amount of money for the night, but we didn't receive a decent response to our complaints and a respectful service! By the way, this restaurant charges you \"split fee of $3\", which is ridiculous! All the nice restaurants I've been to, even in big cities like San Francisco or New York, usually the restaurants offer to split the dish for customers, since they know what good service truly means, instead of assuming all the customers were cheap so the restaurant needed to charge a \"split fee\" to make money out of every customers!!!!  The whole dinning experience was bad, and we are not going back again. We don't want to be treated as cheap customers, especially the quality of the food is not good any more!"}
{"text":"After reading a few of the \" Groupon\" reviews I was reluctant to try this restaurant. So glad we did. It was actually wonderful !! Alan was a great waiter who was very attentive. We did not have to wait long at all between courses. Ironically the ONLY thing we did not enjoy was the bread !! We shared the scallop appetizer with the pesto sauce which was wonderful. Hubby had veal piccata & I had chicken Marsala. Both of our dishes were truly great. Hubby finished off with the creme brûlée & almost licked the plate !!  It was a lovely dinner & we would not hesitate to return !!"}
{"text":"We've been going here for years.  Apprehensive about new owners, but last night we found the food to be FANTASTIC!  Homemade pasta, fresh tasting marinara, generous portions, and delightful service.  Especially grateful for catering to food sensitivities and cooking to order."}
{"text":"We went back to Tesoro for our annual anniversary celebration and found out that they sold the restaurant; their last night is 3/10/15.  Mama said they were training the new staff.   Initially I was going to order something different but when I heard the news, I decided I NEEDED to have the gnocchi one last time.  Hubby did order something different.  He had the linguine with combination seafood.  He said it was the best he'd ever had - quite a testimonial.    We gave Mama one last hug and kiss on the cheek with our best wishes .  We will try it again next time and hopefully the new place will live up to the reputation of the original."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a good local non-chain Italian joint and this hit the spot. The place is TINY - 13 tables, small patio. ALL were packed and this is a Wednesday night at 645pm no less. I ordered several items to try, took some home. Scallop appetizer w/ pesto - very tasty. Real pepper at every table by the way. Trout (special) maybe among the best fish I have ever eaten. Side of spaghetti was ok, sauce not very thick. Lasagna was ridiculously good, heavy ricotta flavor, perfectly done. Also had the ravioli - got one of each type. The cream/tomato sauce was unreal - I could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day. Not cheap but not unreasonable, three mains and an app (no drink) was $70. Highly recommend, not that they need the help!"}
{"text":"Amazing place and best Italian food in scottsdale. I had this delicious crespelle with ricotta and spinach with marinara although tortellini and ravioli was good too. Definitely going back there! P.s.- I wish they had turned the room temperature a little low was a bit hot."}
{"text":"By far the best Italian food I've ever tried in the valley! The restaurant is fairly small but has an overall homey feel to it. It is just about entirely run by one family that makes everything from scratch and it's seriously incredible! The owners often come out to make sure you're enjoying your food and see that their customers are genuinely happy! My family and I have been coming here for years and absolutely love it! The chicken piccata is by far the best I've ever tried and their vodka sauce is to die for. Everything is very fairly priced for the portions and quality food you get. I've never left without leftovers!"}
{"text":"This has always been our favorite Italian restuarant until our last visit. First let me say the food is excellent,however, the service is simply awful thus the lower rating. We had company coming to see us on a weekday and made reservation at 7:30 pm with a request for a side wall table for four. There was a wait to be seated and they placed us in a middle table with two chairs facing the kitchen. There was a hour plus wait for the food to arrive. Additional their was no apology for the delay and the waiter (manager? ) was rude.  The slow service could have been more understandable if we  had been there on a weekend. I have never given a bad review in my life but  we had such an awful experience. Management should hire more help and get a better attitude."}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian restaurant in Arizona! This small restaurant is fantastic and actually has authentic delicious Italian cooking. They make everything fresh and even bring ingredients over from Italy every summer. Soooo good!  The owners are quite lovely and super friendly. Hugged them the last time we came in. Service is great as well. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for mouthwatering, authentic Italian cuisine!! :)"}
{"text":"Very expensive, but also pretty good!   Great service and the atmosphere was cute and cozy. It got loud in there but not to the point that it bothers us.  We loved the wine selection and the lasagna was great as well!  Nice to have such a close by and yummy Italian restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Talk about a true Italian gem, this small, family run spot hits all the right notes.  The white tablecloth's and superior service give it a classy atmosphere.  My wife and I split everything, here there is no air of discontent or charge for splitting.  We started with the escargot ravioli which are obviously homemade, like everything else. A sumptuous sauce with paperthin pasta you can see the escargot through. It was tremendous. The main course last night was lasagna. Again, the pasta was paperthin with layer upon layer of wonderful ricotta cheese and meat sauce all cooked perfectly!  Congratulations on another great meal Tesoro!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Will definitely be back again. Great service and the manager Josh was very attentive. Alan also was very friendly with good recommendations!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant that is almost always full of regulars who know what a gem it is. The food is carefully prepared, the service is very good and the prices are reasonable. I suggest you not attempt to go here without a reservation and that you make your reservation a few days in advance."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with my wife. The homemade bread to start the meal was fantastic. I was worried I was going to fill up on that before my meal arrived! The caprese salad was yummy but my fettuccine bolognese was fantastic. The restaurant is very small but plenty big for us on a weeknight. I imagine it fills quickly on weekends with as good as this place is! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This \"strip mall\" actually has two hidden treasures - George & Sons for Chinese, and this wonderful little place, Tesoro.    The exterior belies the surprisingly lovely and intimate environment inside.  No sign of corporate design here, as a quintesentially classic menu - and an unmistakably old world kitchen staff - quickly set you at ease as you are immersed in a five-sense Italian experience that matches the experience you would expect in more cosmopolitan locations or cities.  I tend to always order something on the menu with no additions or substitutions, but this place seemed like one of those where they would be happy to whip up something special for you, if they have the ingredients on hand to do it right.  Chances are, they will!  Nice wine list, too.  Space VERY limited...but would you have it any other way?"}
{"text":"Love this small place.  It's the best Italian food around.  We love all their pastas.  My kids favorite is gnocchi with pink sauce.  The service is a bit slow but worth the wait.  Tesoro is a true authentic Italian restaurant with great food."}
{"text":"This place is to die for! The veal picatta is wonderful! Great service!"}
{"text":"Nice little Italian place. We had a reservation for 4 & we were seated immediately. The place is small but very nice & comfortably.  Our waiter was very friendly & attentive to our every need. He did not rush us at all. Homemade bread was warm and delicious. We ordered a bruschetta appetizer and each order a different meal. I ordered the veal parm.  I meant to order the chicken but was very pleased with the delicious veal.  We also ordered dessert.  My favorite was the chocolate cream brûlée. It was out of this world. It came with a red velvet cake which was the only item that didn't taste up to par with the rest of the meal.  Will definitely return. We ended up staying & chatting until it closed.  Perfect evening."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner and it was very avvvvvverage..... the wait staff was not trained well at all for the location and experience we were expecting. The stuffed noodles were not noodles. They were crepes so beware if you order any of those dishes. The meat filling was also not very good it tasted like it was frozen meat purée and just warmed it up. As a chef I always expect more out of places than I should but I can't help but criticize this place a bit. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but it is what it is for my experience. Not sure if I will ever return."}
{"text":"Last night first time.  Had take out.  This was a test to see if I liked the food and have my judgment distracted by the service or ambiance   Well my wife and  I loved it.  So much so that we will be their Monday night!  Last star awaiting actual visit for service, etc."}
{"text":"This place is so fabulous! Each dish is perfectly prepared and makes you feel like it was made special just for you.   My husband and I were very impressed with this darling little place."}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious. Service was great, atmosphere even better, and most of all the food was awesome. Had the chicken piccata, i love that you can get a side of pasta or grilled veggies. The veggies were actually really well seasoned as was the chicken, sometimes other restaurants go overboard with the lemon, but this was perfectly seasoned and the chicken was tender and juicy. Also had the meatballs and you could really taste the flavors as well and everything was just so fresh. Lastly, Jake (the owner) suggested a delicious glass of red Rosso from the wine menu and it was the perfect compliment to the meal. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Italian restaurant.  Excellent Veal Picatta, and delicious chocolate martini"}
{"text":"We just celebrated my birthday at Tesoro last night & it was fabulous!  The food was fantastic & our server was absolutely wonderful!  The appetizers were very generous and the entrees reasonably priced.  I had the linguine with clam sauce & the seafood was very plentiful!  Our server was extremely attentive and very sweet about it being my birthday.  We'll definitely be back!  Bryn K. DeFusco"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Nicole is an awesome server and really made our experience over the top! Great expresso martinis, eggplant marinara, and tortellini! Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been to Tesoro twice now, and it has the best Italian food I've had in Scottsdale.   It's small, can be noisy, and the tables are pretty close together.  But, the caprese salad is delicious, and I haven't had olive oil like that since I was in Italy.  You could just drink it!  The eggplant Parmesan actually tastes like eggplant - not just cheese and tomato sauce.  The veal Saltimboca is delicious, as is the tiramisu.  The wine list is good, and the owner walks through the dining room, talking to patrons and making sure everything is fine.  Last time, I was there with my son, who is 6'2\".  He had eaten every bit of the spaghetti that came with his veal, and the owner asked him if he wanted more!  When does that happen?  When I told her we had come to celebrate his birthday, she brought him an Italian liqueur and the most delicious cannoli I've ever eaten.  (We split it, it was large!) The atmosphere is relaxed, the owners are friendly, obviously love good food and want to do a good job.  This is my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale - and right around the corner from my house!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night based on a recommendation - Tesoro did not disappoint!!   I ordered the Ravioli, and when I couldn't decide between meat and cheese, our server offered that the kitchen make it half & half - perfect! That said, I think the cheese version wins out! The rest of my table also stuck with classic dishes - lasagna & spaghetti al Pomodoro, both of which were executed wonderfully and also tasted delicious.   Important to note - the restaurant is tiny (probably 15 tables) so you should definitely make a reservation! I wouldn't want to wait.   Overall, a wonderful dining experience with great atmosphere, service, and food!"}
{"text":"Make sure you make reservations! its a very tight, quaint establishment.  The service was very attentive, as we had three servers rotating throughout the small restaurant. To begin with, you get some bread which I wasn't a huge fan of. The olive oil was great though! We had the scallops for an appetizer and I have to say, this was the highlight of the meal. The scallops were slightly salty, but I love, love, love, salt, so I was in heaven. Make sure you take your high blood pressure meds before eating these though!   I ordered the chicken parm and the hubs ordered the veal parm. I hate to say this but my chicken parm was very tasteless and dry... sorry. I should've gotten a pasta dish instead. oh well, lesson learned.  Otherwise, good dinner. easy parking and nice family owned establishment which bumps it up to a four star from a 3.5.  Parking is a breeze as well. so plus half star for ease of parking."}
{"text":"We ate at Tesoro for the first time last night. We had heard about it from a couple we met while we out to dinner. They said if u love \"Italian\" food u have to try Tesoro. This is a small place so you have to call ahead. We had a 5:00 resv. And at around 6:00 the place was full. It's very small but a lovely atmosphere. We were greeted by the hostess and were seated promptly. The service is outstanding. We started with their mozarella caprese salad. They make their own mozzarella, on top of 4 sliced tomatoes and basil, drizzled with evoo. My husband ordered Oso Bucco, which was a special. If its ever on the menu u HAVE to try it. It was positively the best he's ever had. After listening to him moan, bite after bite , I had to try it. It was delicious! I ordered the Gnochi which was also the best I've ever had. They were light and melted in  your mouth. Combined with the light tomato cream sauce. Mmmmm! A small Italian woman with a white apron came out and asked us how our meals were. We found out she and her husband are the owners. We noticed she greeted and hugged many iof the guests. Obviously, they have many faithful, return customers. There are so many entrees I want to try. Can't wait to go back  They have a 4 course wine tasting coming up Mon. June 11th. I'm hoping they still have availability because  I heard these sell out quickly. And I can totally understand why. You MUST try this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Last night four of us had a fabulous dinner.  We have been coming here for years. The menu is wonderful....something for everyone.  The food is so fresh and prepared so perfectly and comes to the table \"hot\".  The meat sauce is a home run, as well, as just about everything on the menu.  The wine list is extensive and has a price point for everyone.  We are never disappointed dining here.  Make sure you make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Since Tesoro recently changed ownership there have been a couple of poor reviews but also many good ones, so I decided to see for myself.  Two visits provided a mixed experience but there are very troubling signs.  The bottom line is that the food is spotty.  Some items were quite good, although almost all suffered from a lack of seasoning (including salt).  Others were mediocre.  I think Tesoro has overcome some of its management problems, but the pace of service was a shade slow on one visit, even though they were not busy.  And there is good value here as prices are lower than in other similar restaurants and portions are large.  But in the end it all comes down to food.  For example, the tripe appetiser has good flavor but I find it hard to get over the fact that it is a frozen commercial product which they thaw in a microwave (we could watch the cooks from our table).  And the scallops were large, meaty, fresh, and perfectly cooked, served on just the right amount of pesto -- but two of the three were sandy.  The pasta is cooked al dente -- a bit too al dente for me -- but the fettucini Bolognese did not have enough sauce and was bland.  And in the flavorless chicken marsala, the chicken had an odd consistency just on the edge of being undercooked.  Some dishes were very good, however, most notably the veal saltimbocca and eggplant parmesan.  I think Tesoro uses high quality ingredients for the most part, and there is at least one chef with potential, but inconsistency kills and it is doing Tesoro in."}
{"text":"Even though it is 30 miles away, I will be coming back to Tesoro often.  The osso bucco alone is worth it.  Succulent veal bathed in a light brown sauce sitting on top of parmesan risotto.  And did I mention the bone marrow?  Seriously amazing.  One of the top 3 things I've ever eaten.  The osso bucco alone should merit 5 stars, but the soup was boring and the mozzarella was slightly cold."}
{"text":"I ordered from their catering menu for a Party I was having New Year's Day. The food was excellent. Everyone made such a fuss about how good everything was and my group is picky. I especially loved the eggplant parmigiana. It was delicious and authentic. Everything was so fresh and the young man who helped me Josh was so professional and kind. You also have to try the tiramisu! It is the best I've had in the valley. It will not disappoint. Everyone also gobbled up all the bread and meatballs! Meatballs are amazing!!! They are an excellent value for fresh authentic italian food. Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really zero stars for zero service!  Absolutely the worst restaurant in the Valley.  Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Vito's Italian Restaurant where exceptional service and food is the norm and customers are appreciated and treated with respect."}
{"text":"I think Tesoro is the cutest place.  It's so romantic too, with small, intimate tables and twinkling lights all around.  The lighting is dim, and it's a great place to take your significant other.    It's definitely not a family friendly place...but it's great for going on a date.  And the food is really good.  The price range is around $14-20 for your entree, $5-7 for salad and $7-9 for an appetizer.    I really liked the entree I ordered- it was gnocchi in a tomato-cream sauce.  And my boyfriend's dish was equally as good.  He got the eggplant marina.  We also had the bruschetta and the caprese salad, both were very good, but it left us no room for dessert.  :(  The restaurant itself is located in a shopping plaza, right by a Dairy Queen and a dollar store, so don't let it put you off.  It's a special little place with really good food. Check it out."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional, service is friendly and the price is reasonable. I am from out of town but made sure I went back to Tesoro the very next time I returned to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Tesoro Ristorante Italiano is a great atmosphere for any occasion. The food is terrific and is some of the best Italian food I've ever had the opportunity to eat. The tables are nicely decorated, and the servers are quick and friendly with any of your needs. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating and has great parking. Make sure to save room for dessert, which along with the food, is also authentic and delicious. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a true authentic Italian dinner. Did I mention they have To Go ordering available also? Check this place out, if you haven't already done so, one time will be all it takes to get you hooked!"}
{"text":"We have an agreement with friends. We meet for dinner at a restaurant that none of us knew. I selected Tesoro based on it being centrally located and its Yelp rating. It was a pleasant surprise. We never felt rushed and enjoyed our wine and conversation. Our meals were superb, just like being in Italy. I had sole piccata, light and flavorful. A great place. Friendly, attentive and knowledgable staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good but wasn't everything I had hoped especially for the price.  The waitress was good. The atmosphere was great. It was such a cozy little gem. Next came the bread. It was warm and delicious, but once it was gone we were not offered more. That was a dissapointing because other Italian restaurants constantly bring out more bread since it is not only the cheapest thing for the restaurant to make or buy, but also because it's an expectation of Italian restaurants.   I ordered the scallops as an appetizer and artichoke/mushroom ravioli for dinner. My fiancé got veal parm. Scallops were dissapointing. They were small and you only get 3. They were not anything great. I would not get them again. The ravioli was amazing and very reasonable. My fiancé loved the veal parm. So it was all okay overall.  Not sure if or when I'll go back."}
{"text":"I was hoping that Tesoro's would be wonderful, but was disappointed by the experience. The woman who was 'greeting' people when they walked inside had the personality of a grumpy shoe. She also served as a waitress. It was very warm inside so I was glad my food was to go.  The tortellini was quite tasty, however I am not a big fan of large chunks of ground black pepper, of which there was an awful lot. We also tried the eggplant parmigiana which was only so-so, because there wasn't much to the dish other than a few slices of breaded eggplant with a bit of marinara and melted cheese. It certainly wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"As good as anything I've had in my NJ Italian neighborhood - including excellent service from a family-run business - really makes me feel like home!  Have been very pleased on several visits with the with soup, caprese and gnocchi.   Yes, it's tiny and moderately priced, but you decide what you want more, good food or more room to spread out?  Good food or a table the minute you walk in so you don't get chilly?   Frankly, I love the food and service enough to get over it."}
{"text":"Outstanding Pasta; Great Ambiance; good wine and great service aga fair price.  What a Gem!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! I came here with my sister for her birthday and everything was so delicious! It's a tiny little restaurant that has amazing Italian food and yummy drinks.   This place is simply real authentic Italian. I ordered the tortellini filled with cheese in a cream sauce with peas, prosciutto, and toasted walnuts. Everything about this was simply delicious. I think my only complaint was that I couldn't really taste the prosciutto in it. It was also a very good portion.   Their drink menu wasn't on the website, so I can't remember what my drink was called, however it was some sort of chocolate martini. Holy cow, this was delicious. You definitely get your money's worth on their martinis here. I told them it was my sister's birthday so they also brought out a little dessert for her as well.   The customer service was great, I wish they were closer to me, however I'll definitely be back!."}
{"text":"This place is the REAL DEAL! Yummy! Family owned and run. Love this place, and everything I've eaten. Highly recomend."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Phoenix area! It's a true family-run place where all the food is fresh and authentic. The caprese includes mozzarella made from scratch by one of the owners, and is to die for! The pasta is all made in-house, which is a rare find. The wine list was created by the son of the owners, who is a sommelier living in Italy. If that wasn't enough, the desserts are all home-made and excellent too! I can't say enough about this place, and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Probably the best home cooked Italian meal we've had. The dining area was surprisingly quaint , white tablecloths, soft lighting, nice music. We ordered a house salad of mixed greens with a delightful vinegrette dressing and fresh grated cheese. The homemade bread had just come from the oven and with it's hard crust was delicious.  Our main dishes were veal parmesan with a side of pasta and veal cannelloni.  We knew we were in for a treat when we heard the chief pounding the cutlet. We weren't disappointed. The veal parmesan could be cut with a fork. The cannelloni melted in your mouth. The flavors and sauce were out if this world.  If you want delicious homecooked authentic Italian this is the place to come."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Tesoro's last week for the first time. The restaurant had a romantic vibe.  The service was excellent, Our server Fabio was attentive, but not overly. Fabio had great wine recommendations and provided some great tips for when my wife and I visit Italy. We shared a bottle of Malbec for a reasonable price, and split the tripe as an appetizer.  The tripe was tender in a sauce with veggies.  My wife had a fish special which was fresh, light and a nice size portion.  I had fresh fettuccini with mussels, huge shrimp, clams, and scallops. This dish melted in my mouth.  The homemade pasta couldn't be better and they did not skimp on the seafood.  We had a wonderful evening, and plan on visiting the next time we have a craving for Italian food.  This is has been our favorite Italian restaurant since moving to the Valley.  In case you want to consider the source.....I'm Italian American from Brooklyn, NY.  Our only regret was that there was no room for dessert."}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was very nice.  They accommodated me and I did not have a reservation. The place is small do it was full for a Tuesday. Chicken saltimboca with veggies. The cook came out and told me she will make anything I want even if is not in the menu. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"In town visiting family and I wanted Italian and found this place on Yelp with a large number of very good reviews. I felt confident suggesting this place. I was wrong, so very wrong. I have to conclude the only reason this place got 4 and 5 stars means the owner has a very large family. That's the only explanation I can come up with. Arriving there with reservations we sat down and a waiter greeted us quickly. After his initial visit to give us menus he left and I think he hit his head which caused amnesia because he left us for an extended time. Returning with water glasses, two of which were dirty (more on than soon) he left again. Tic toc, tic toc. Returning again after 15 minutes he promised us bread  and took our drink order. The wine came quick enough but no bread, clean glasses or water. Another 1/2 hour ensued and we sucked down a full bottle of wine before he took our dinner order. No water or bread even as we asked again. When dinner was served and we asked for water and bread for the 5th time and we were then told they ran out of bread (WTF!!, an Italian joint with no bread early in the evrning!) even though a table seated after us got bread.  Now for the food. Salads were terrible and tasteless and the mozzarella was like 20 grit sandpaper. Clearly not fresh. The main courses were lousy as well. Mushroom and artichoke ravioli was as tough as shoe leather, spaghetti and sausage came with two enormous uncut sausages that likely were thawed out sitting in the sauce back in the kitchen. Others had gnocchi and it was minimally passable. Chef Boyardee canned pasta is better.  As we were waiting for our check (over 2 hours after we arrived) a fellow guest who was leaving asked how we liked dinner. When we offered up some destressed faces he told us that he saw directly into the kitchen and saw the staff taking dirty glasses being return from a table and  wiping them off to be used again immediately. No dishwashing for them. So that's not where our water went.  The only redeeming part of our outing is two doors down from the resturant was a Dairy Queen. Soft cones....yum...."}
{"text":"Downgrading my review from a year ago. The food is okay but not as good as it used to be for the money spent. The presentation was also not as nice as I remember. The staff seems ungracious and uncaring for diners and each other.   The menu seemed changed from a year ago when they featured many Italian seafood options.  We did use Yelp reservations for our dinner for the first time and and the reservation reminders proved very helpful to our busy lives."}
{"text":"This place is easily the best Italian restaurant in the valley.   The atmosphere is cozy. And yes, you will be seated near other parties, so if you are planning on having a lurid conversation you might want to choose another restaurant. Don't make any loud inappropriate jokes.  I know Rabi Doohan III has been here on more than one occasion, and I'm wondering how he coped having to spend a whole dinner session without making a loud inappropriate joke. I know for a certainty that if the two of us went and had dinner there, that we might rack up a complaint or two. Anyway...  The food is top notch. I had the veal saltimbocca, which is hard to find in the valley. I highly approve.  The service was top notch. I felt right at home. The owner made me feel like I was apart of the family.  If you go here on a date(app, entree, bottle of wine) expect to spend anywhere in the range of $75-$90. If you want to pop in for an entree you can get out of there in the 15-25 range. Well worth it in my opinion."}
