{"text":"This grocery store has a meat section. Fresh produce. And your canned goods to make your meals. Soda and beer also is sold here.

New to the store is they just opened a small restaurant. Some bar stools and three tables. It is small but you can do take out.
 
We went their first day. They are starting out slow so they had tacos. We ordered steak and pork tacos. They were amazing just the right amount of heat and cooked just right. Real fresh tacos. They gave us some salsa to put on top. We both liked it but my husband thought it was to hot. We will be back.
Price was ok, I can't really remember cause we bought some groceries.
They will have soup,tamales, burritos soon."}
{"text":"Coming from San Diego I was on the lookout for a good taco place with great burritos as well. This place does not disappoint. Hands down the best place in the Madison area for good Mexican food. Hurry up and get there before it starts getting lines haha"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos!  We discovered that they had a small restaurant in the grocery store a few months ago and it has become one of our regular spots for lunch.  I eat there at least once a week and am never disappointed.  I personally like the tacos better than the burritos but both were good.  I have not had any of the other offerings.  Friends have repeatedly ordered the Tortas and raved about them.  Lately I have been downing the Chorizo tacos as if they're going out of style.  So good!!  The asada and tripa are highly recommended as well as those are also favorites.

As others have stated, there is not a lot of room for dining in.  A couple tables and 4 or 5 bar stools.  It can get pretty busy if you hit the lunch rush but service is fast and the staff are always very friendly.  Plus they are happy to customize your order if you ask.  The tacos come standard topped with onion and cilantro (lime on the side), I have been adding cheese and avocado for a small up-charge.  They also make their own red and green sauces which are also really great.

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Bar none, the best tacos I have had (I am a well traveled foodie).  Favorite is beef lengua; the most tender beef ever.  The lamb soup is out of this world.  Prices are great, portions are more than generous, service time is quick.  The quality of many types of meat is amazing.  Let them cook and you pick up pork, lamb, or chorizo (and more) to go.  You can also buy the homemade green or red salsa (hot).  Still warm, freshly made chicken tamales by the dozen.  People buy a weeks worth of burritos and freeze them.  A gorta sandwich will feed a family of four.  Everything is made in front of you.  Friendliest folks possible.  All the staples for Hispanic cooking are available as a grocery store.  Repeated testimonials, from patrons I spoke with, have related this is the best taquarita in Madison."}
{"text":"Had the most authentic tasting tacos el pastor this evening for carry out! They were delicious! The green salsa on top just added more perfection. I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for the best torts pollo milanesa in Wisconsin since moving here two years ago, and I've finally found it!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place yesterday and just had to try it today. I was not disappointed. 

I had tacos - pork and steak, and my son had the steak burrito. I also added cheese and avocado and both salsas, and both of our meals were excellent with fantastic prices. 

If you live in Sun Prairie and like authentic Mexican food, give this place a try. 

There are only enough seats for about 10-12 people because it's tucked inside a grocery store, so be prepared to take your order to go."}
{"text":"Hands down the best place to grab a burrito. Great ingredients, great service. A hidden gem in downtown Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"I need to amend my review of Sal's...this is the only other place I would recommend people driving out to Sun Prairie for.  I've been here twice for take out burritos, and I've been nothing but thrilled with both of my experiences.

For being such a small/unique place, you can tell it's good because they are always pushing out just a ton of Mexican food.  I have stuck with the mixed meat burrito on both occasions.  The flavors blend together great.  And the size is one of the largest burritos I've seen.  Even though I haven't bought anything from the grocery section, there is a wide range of ethnic products if your heart desires.  Definitely stop in here if you want a great meal."}
{"text":"I feel like the cat who swallowed the canary.  I had lunch at this place today and it was outstanding!  I noshed on 3 pastor tacos that were completely filled with pork, onion and cilantro.  They were perfect!  They were $2 each and the largest I've had for that price, ever.  A customer sitting next to me ordered a quesadilla and it was HUGE....I wish I would have ordered that...oh well...there's alwayz tomorrow!!  Oh, BTW I recommend you put both red and green sauce on your tacos!  Later~"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here after hearing about it from a coworker and I wasn't disappointed. I got the beef tripe, asada, and al pastor taco and all three were amazing. Even though it was a hot, humid day, I was still greeted by smiling faces and everyone there was so pleasant. My coworker ended up getting a quesadilla and I'm definitely going to have to get that next time. 

Food is great. Service is great. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Better than food I've had in Mexico. I had the taco specials of barracoa, borrega, and pollo. So flavorful and generous portions. Can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"The carne asada burritos are delicious and huge! Our girls love the big quesadillas with Mexican melting cheese. You can buy a container of their homemade salsas in the fridge and a bag of tortilla chips, and you will satisfy your craving for authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"We regularly get take out for our family here. Everyone loves the burritos and my kids often say how healthy they taste. Seriously, they aren't dripping with grease, just fresh, tasty, authentic ingredients. Generous portions too. The meat counter/butcher is a few steps from the grill and customer seating area. Can't get more fresh than that. I enjoy watching them prepare the various orders as I wait for mine. Friendly, busy, talented folks. We've never been disappointed."}
