{"text":"Let me just start by saying that I'm a life-long Mineo's fan, and a die-hard one at that.   I've been eating at the Sq. Hill Mineo's for 30 years, and have never had a single bad experience there, in terms of either service or food quality.  I shout their quality far & wide, because I LOVE them. However, my job is out in the West End, and, having forgotten my dinner one night, I searched online & found a Mineo's 2 miles from my work -- hooray!  I called them for pick up and had a slightly weird phone conversation with the girl who answered, when I asked if I could get 3 slices plain, and she responded \"I'm not sure if we have any single cuts right now, let me check.\"  They did (only 2), but she explained to me that they don't make a lot of \"single cuts\" at night, apparently preferring their customers to order whole pies.  (Meanwhile, I've been ordering 2 or 3 cuts plain from the Sq. Hill location at least twice a month for 30 years, and they've never so much as blinked at the order.)  Whatever.  So I go to pick up the pizza & bring it back to work, excited to sit down to it.  I was VERY disappointed, to say the least.  The pizza tastes NOTHING like the Mineo's I've been eating my entire life -- which it absolutely should, as it's a small family-owned local chain, and I know for a fact the recipe is the same at all locations.  However, this pizza had thicker dough (not necessarily a bad thing), the sauce was significantly less well-spiced, and the cheese was as bland as I've ever had.  Honestly, Papa John's would have had more flavor, and that's saying something.  I've no idea if all the other Mineo's locations do as poorly as this one does, but suffice it to say, I'll be sticking to the Sq. Hill location for the next 30 years too."}
{"text":"I thought this place was Ok until I recieved a buffalo chicken pizza without any buffalo sauce on it. I spoke with the guy who \"personally cut my pizza\" and said I was wrong. Then offered extra sauce on my next order. Nothing was offered to get me to order again. When I order a specialty pizza I expect it to be correct."}
{"text":"This place is horrible, I do not know why I keep giving them chance after chance. Ordered a gyro wedgie tonight to fulfill my gyro craving because I was too lazy to head out to Olympos Gyros and rather stay in watching football. BIG MISTAKE.   Their frozen shredded gyro meat actually didn't taste too bad. The amount was minimal though. You couldn't of filled a $4-5 gyro with the amount of meat in this huge $11.99 wedgie. The lettuce on it looked outdated, a lot of brown, and slimy.    All I picked off and ate was the gyro meat & feta. A good $2.00 worth. Not sure where my other $9.99 went to. I made a New Years Resolution, never to order from this garbage overpriced place again. Come on they put Marzetti ranch dressing in containers so you think they made it. LOL. More classy than the packets they used to give out though.  For the reviewers that do not know: This is owned by Pizza Milano and in no way affiliated with Mineos Pizza House of Squirrel Hill/Mt Leb."}
{"text":"I ordered pickup tonight and when I got there about 15 minutes after they said it would be ready, card in hand, the girl manning the counter completely ignored me while she took 5 phone orders. 5! She never even LOOKED at me until she tossed an 'I'll be with you in a minute' after call #4. I'm in the service industry and I know, as common sense dictates, that people inside are priority. It would've taken a minute or two to swipe my card and hand me my food. I left and hours later got a phone call and hang up after 3 rings. We called back and said calmly why we left (we already got food elsewhere so we weren't hangry lol) and she said 'oh okay' and hung up. Nice. On other trips I said no to cheese sauce and got charged for it and other such nonsense. Or I asked for ranch, paid for it, and never got it, I'm done. Customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"How effing dare this place call themselves Mineo's Pizza!  This is nothing more than a typical half-assed Pizza Milano.  Beware locals and travelers alike - this is not to be confused with \"Mineo's Pizza HOUSE\" located in Squirrel Hill and Mt. Lebanon."}
{"text":"The pizza here is normally ok to good but a great value so we tried the Gyro sandwich and that was a mistake.  They put 4 very thin slices of meat. Everything on the sandwich over played the minuscule amount of meat. Very disappointing now i can't trust anything on their menu to be a normal serving size. So long you lost us"}
{"text":"Normally I never have a problem here. I've been ordering from here for most of my life. Today though not very happy. Ordered a salad with no onions or tomato, it had both. Also, the pizza wasn't even cut. Previous experience I can give a pass for a mistake just hope this isn't a new trend for them."}
{"text":"Staying at the Radisson, we arrived a tad late to do anything but order in.  The front desk handed us several menus and we chose Mineo's.  We ordered Italian Wedding soup, a mini Pepperoni pizza, and an Italian Calzone.  After waiting for 45 minutes, I was given the honor of treking down to the front desk to get my order.  The pizza truly was a mini and had a mediocre taste.  The crust, sauce and toppings were fairly flavorless.  I went over to get some of the soup but I think there must have been a divorce before arriving since there appeared to be some missing items (meatballs) from the bowl.  The broth and noodles had a decent flavor and were not overly salty.  The calzone was burnt on top and so I abstained from eating any of it.  My friend didn't have a smile.    Thanks Radisson!  I think they are getting a kick-back."}
{"text":"Not a true \"Mineos\" it's actually another local chain that isn't that great. I ordered a pizza thinking it was Mineos pizza and was surprised when i saw the box I asked why the box said something else."}
{"text":"Good greasy pizza great for munchies, meatball sub was fire...."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from this place. When we opened the pizza box we found ants in the box. We called and told them about the ants and asked for our money back but they refused to give us a refund    Will not be going back here again.  Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"We ordered out from here recently, and it wasn't a bad pizza at all. We got a \"works\" or \"supreme\" pizza (I can't recall the exact name, but it had everything on it), and it was decent. I have had better to tell the truth. They have tiramisu also, which is excellent. They're a little pricey though. $32 for a small pizza and a salad!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived to our hotel around 11:00 pm. We were hungry so we called Mineo's Pizza and ordered a Hawaiian pizza.  It was delivered in 35-40 minutes and was warm. The pizza was in between thick and thin. There was a decent amount of toppings, but I always welcome more.  Their delivered pizza was okay. I would guess that it is a little better when you dine in."}
{"text":"Lots of bad reviews but their \"wing dust\" wing rub is AMAZING!!! Must try! Had the buffalo chicken pizza previously, was not good. Wings are the best things they have here. Ask for them well done btw."}
{"text":"This place is horrible -- I asked them if I could use the gift certificate at the Mineo's pizza on Murray Avenue in Squirrel Hill and the owner/manager said YES.  I did not realize these two pizza companies are completely different and not the same.  They advertise themselves as Mineos Pizza, but they are not the REAL Mineos.  The owner straight up lied to me to make $ on a gift certificate.  Bad people = Bad Business Karma."}
{"text":"Best place for pizza in the area in my opinion. I mainly stick to the pizza so the other stuff Im not sure."}
{"text":"Ordered well done with pepperoni.  Pizza was not done, let alone was it \"well done\".  Recurrent issue with this place, that's why I ask for well done.  Haven't had issues up until now, I call and then they keep explaining how I am lieing to them ( to make it short ) and that this is the person that \"personally\" saw my pizza come out of the oven.  It was RAW DOE.   Offered to give to the driver and physically show him under the half melted cheese..  didn't matter..  Not ordering there again, they probably should have stayed closed when that minivan ran through the front of it, as they apparently can't tell when a pizza is cooked or not..  avoid this place.    Raw pizza doe EQUALS salmonella or ECOLi.    The pizza wasn't even warm when it got to my house, which is five minutes away.. that was a none issue at that point though, I didn't even mention it.  Shouldn't have been a big deal but apparently they're robots ( not human like the rest of us ) and never screw orders up."}
