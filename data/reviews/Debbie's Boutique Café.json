{"text":"I have popped in several times before for a quick coffee. I love the community feel of the place. Debbie is also  super sweet and a hands on type of owner/operator.
Coffee is delicious. I came in today with hubby for a lite  breakfast, we both had english muffins with egg and cheese, served on a proper plate with some  fresh fruit. So good."}
{"text":"Debbie's is one of my favourite places to go for lunch in Durham.  The caf√© has such a cozy environment and the staff are very friendly.   I usually opt for the salads which are nice and fresh but the sandwiches are quite tasty.  The chai tea latte is delicious."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have lunch that wouldn't be too expensive.  I found Debbie's Boutique through yelp.

We ordered the lunch special for $10 which included a sandwich/wrap with soup or salad and a drink. We had the sweet chilli wrap with a garden salad with balsamic dressing (there are various dressings to choose from) and a roast beef sandwich with a salad. Again, they had various sandwiches available as well as quiche to choose from. These were delicious and filling, good portions for a lunch meal.

We also had a coffee and their specialty iced tea which both were delicious.

The service was great, the waiter was informative and gave great suggestions.

Another plus, free wi-fi!

I would come back and try other items of their menu, I saw some great pastries and cakes."}
{"text":"First off, the owner is an absolute delight. She is an amazing cook, and has cultivated an amazing \"quiet trendy downtown coffee shop\" vibe right here in Ajax. 

I have never had a bad meal here, the chicken sandwiches are to die for, and the staff is always there to recommend something new, or reaffirm your old favourites. 

Whether you're on a date, looking to work out of the office, or looking for a quiet place to sit and enjoy a weekend afternoon, Debbie's is always a great idea."}
{"text":"Really nice feel to the place.  Good tea selection.  Try the delicious homemade cranberry cookies.  The breakfast wraps and sandwiches are also quite nice and you get a little bit of salad or fruit on the side.  Free wifi."}
{"text":"Warm and cozy place, scrumptious food, amazing coffee and a delightful host (Debbie). Went in for a quick coffee today with my wife and kid and had a wonderful time. Debbie is a pure delight, makes you feel welcome and treats you not as a customer but family. Definitely, recommend. Glad to have such an amazing place in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend on the weekend and all of the sandwich types that I wanted, they didn't have enough of the ingredients for...they explained that this was because they always get their food fresh and it was the end of the week so they were about to stock up on ingredients. They then asked me \"What would you like? We'll make it work and we'll make you whatever you want\" and they did just that! The attitudes were amazing of the employees, everything was made fresh and even though while paying, I thought it was a bit pricey for a coffee and sandwich, I have to say that the quality made it worth every single penny! The woman to made my sandwich even came over to check if it was to my liking, which it absolutely was! Will definitely revisit!"}
{"text":"I have tried to like Debbie's because they are a local, independent cafe that supports the community. 

At first I found the food to be expensive , but of average quality. I just didn't feel that a $9 turkey sandwich should be made with cold cuts, or a $10 salad just leaves, tomato, and cucumbers.

I decided to back and was surprised to have a really nice meal, as did everyone I was with. Quiche, salad and soup lunch combo was great and the date square was delicious.

I still think it's best to go for the baked goods and tea if you're in a rush. If you have the time to wait, it's a nice place to meet for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a hot drink and dessert, their baked goods are excellent. They also stock a nice selection of teas, and the staff is always helpful with suggestions. As for their food, it can run a bit pricey for what you get, however I've yet to be disappointed with anything off their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Amazing service fresh delicious food!!  Warm ambience.  We were warmly welcomed by Debbie. Prices are fair for the quality and quantity"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! A hidden gem! Cozy environment, AMAZING food, large tea selection. Lovely staff, reasonable prices. If I lived closer this would be my go to place. They have board games and a message board with events that happen. If you live in Ajax, lucky you. 

BUT! Heads up we were told they are changing management for the beginning of May so this review may become null and void."}
{"text":"I love it here! The staff are always friendly and make great suggestions. The coffee they use is awesome. They have a lot of milk options and a great tea selection. I have yet to make it in when the cinnamon buns are fresh that day however, I have bought the day old ones and they're fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been to Debbie's many times and have tried quite a few different things there. The desserts are awesome, I love the cinnamon buns and cheesecake; so good. Their soups and sandwiches are always so tasty, and the staff are super friendly. The flavoured lattes are very good as well, my favourite flavours to get are cupcake and banana split."}
{"text":"Came here for a special Mother's Day brunch! Typically they are closed on Sundays but they were open for the occasion. We had a party of 8 with a special menu that had a few different options for food including a choice of tea, coffee, or hot chocolate. For the main, I got the quiche which was SO delicious! It was so fluffy and had a great light flavour. My sister got the waffles and said they were great too. The quiche was so good I want to return to get it again!"}
{"text":"Loved this place when I lived in Ajax. It really is a hidden gem. I used to get their chicken sandwich with the herbed mayo with a soup and funky drink of course. 
Debbie 's diner is well priced, supports the local economy/talent through local artwork and poetry slams, they have fantastic desserts and I can't say enough about it. 
The atmosphere is comfy and there are board games to play and books to read. A very inviting space with lots to offer."}
{"text":"We stopped by here for a little snack. I had a s'mores brownie which they heated up for me and was delish! The girls behind the counter recommended the ginger peach tea which was also great.

The menu looks large and impressive and I will go back and try something else maybe for lunch or brunch.

The staff were really friendly and hey, it's always great to support a local business. We should all do it more frequently."}
{"text":"Awesome little coffee shop. Coffee is amazing and the vibe is great in there. Stop by sometime and try it out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Was very pleased to visit Debbie's cafe yesterday for a coffee and sandwich. Its a nice cozy environment with a serene ambiance. Food and service was excellent. Will definitely visit again and recommend to our contacts."}
{"text":"Would actually rate them 3.5/5. Debbie's is nothing short of homely and sentimental. From the deco to the service, you'll feel like you're sitting in a friend's kitchen. Located in downtown Ajax in a shanty plaza, Debbie's is a local favorite.

The bad: one late evening I came in craving a slice of cake. Ordered carrot cake. Believe it was made in-house. Sat all pretty but when I tried to fork a piece to eat... both the cake and icing was crumbly. Absolutely no adhesion, thus I fashioned an awkward collection of chunks and crumbs on my fork. If this wasn't enough, it was 3/4 icing and 1/4 cake. The icing was hard and cold. Their fridge must have been on blast. To top it off, the carrot cake itself tasted nothing like carrot but completely like over spiced bread. I couldn't even pretend to like it. I ate a quarter and disposed the rest... and I never toss food. Other than that it is a very dark restaurant. Could use better lighting into the evening.

The good: breakfast here is like small ray of sunshine in the morning. Tea selection is spectacular. Right for you if you're a plain \"earl grey\" on some days, but a \"cream of earl grey\" on others like tea-keener me. I like the freshness of the some of the food I've had such as sandwiches, soups, and wraps and seeing it prepped in front of you.

As much as I want to want to redeem my negative experience, sadly I haven't visited since that careless slice of carrot cake. I wish I was overdramatizing. Won't be here again unless it was for tea."}
{"text":"Debbie's Cafe is a venue frequented by my Mom and never thought of trying it until my girlfriend and I were looking for a nice cafe to hang out in. As soon as I walked in I was pleasantly surprised by the decor, atmosphere and cleanliness. My girlfriend had an Iced Coffee and I had a Cream of Earl Grey Tea.  Both were delicious. The baked goods are incredible and even though a lot of the baked goods are $4-$5 they are more than large enough to share or enjoy them In place of a meal. The owner was great and she noticed we were new right away. She greeted us pleasantly and I asked how she knew it was my first time. She replied that she tries to know all of her clients. Amazing. Starbucks......take some pointers. This is customer service at its best.  Not only will I be going back but Debbie has enticed me to become a regular after my first visit. Bravo Debbie, Bravo!"}
{"text":"It's a nice quaint place! A cute little cafe to get food, study and relax. The food is okay but they do have a large selection of organic teas which is great. I think this a hidden gem of ajax."}
{"text":"Should I go to Ajax Main Branch Library across the street? 

Should I go to Debbie's Boutique Cafe?

Both have Free WIFI...but Debbie's has drinks..food...dessert...and much more cozier!!

Cappuccino ($3.65) was steamy hot with a nice milk foam on top. The roast is a little weak and mellow but did make a good breakfast drink.

The interior has this some one family room vibe... and if you have kids they can even have a scoop or 2 of the Kawartha Ice Cream.

Opens till 9:30 pm... that's pretty late for a suburb Cafe...and on Saturday after 6:30 pm they even have an Open Mic Session...."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little coffee shop in downtown Ajax.  It looks a little shady on the outside cus the plaza is old looking but inside it's really cute except for a table in the back with a tea party settings and a freaky doll that looks like it will haunt you in your dreams.

My niece enjoyed their Belgian hot chocolate and I enjoyed my matcha latte with coconut milk.  They also have lunch specials for $10 which is cool.  I will have to come back and try the food."}
