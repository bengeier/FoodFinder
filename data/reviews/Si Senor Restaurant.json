{"text":"Another late night option if you're hungry at 1am. I find most of the food here pretty good. The quesadillas are really tasty, but sometimes the cheese isn't melted all the way through... The burgers are good, but tend to take awhile. Smoothies are really good as well, but they always run out of ingredients early in the day. I guess smoothies for breakfast is on everyone's list."}
{"text":"Si Senor is not my favorite taco option. I got a steak taco and the bit of steak was so little my meat was about the size of a quarter. I could hardly believe how little meat I had.   I ate here because in the summer they have an outside food stand at the USX tower.  I remember being out of the taco that wanted.  So whenever a food venture is out of something that I want that immediately knocks off some starts for me.  The salsa options were great but I dare say Qdoba is better then this place."}
{"text":"Ick.  I don't think this classifies as Mexican.  I was mislead by the name but should have known better once I saw they offer wraps.  I figured they used the name wraps in place of burritos since... well... Pittsburgh is really unfamiliar with Mexican food.

I ordered the classic wrap which, according to the description, is your choice of protein, beans, cheese, rice, and choice of sauce stuffed in a tortilla.  I went with the shredded beef and chipotle sauce.  What I got ... well I can see why they referred to it as a wrap and not a burrito.  The tortilla was cold (what?) and the \"shredded beef\" was more like beef chunks.  The iceberg lettuce was an unwelcome surprise.  Black beans.... I hate black beans.  I guess it was wrong to assume they would be pinto or refried.  The chipotle sauce wasn't spicy at all and just added a burnt flavor.

Would never come back.  I can't believe I paid $7.20 for this wrap.  

If for some odd reason you want to try this place.... they do offer vegan / vegetarian options with grilled veggies and tofu as an option for your filling.

P.S. California, I miss you."}
{"text":"The tacos were cold and the dude was sketchy.  I probably could have told this just by looking but I had gotten lost on my way to ginger's and was hungry.

At least it was cheap."}
