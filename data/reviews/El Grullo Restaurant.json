{"text":"Very good ingredients. The food is fast and very good. Will definitely eat here again when I'm in Arizona"}
{"text":"Owner very helpful when i asked question regarding ingredients. He didnt hesitate to check the ingredient list for me since i have allergies. Overall the food was excellent! The red hot sauce was delicious! I will definetly be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. They DO serve authentic Mexican food. I am Mexican so i can guarantee this is one of the few places you will eat 100% Mexican dishes. Try the enchiladas i love the! Also, its cheap :)"}
{"text":"Great place for tacos in Mesa.  Fabulous birria and good shrimp dishes.  We come back to try different plates and haven't found one we don't like yet.  Good service and clean.  Que mas quieres?"}
{"text":"Food was okay....I've tasted much better. The lady in front was very Standoffish...tried asking questions and she seemed bothered by them. She kept looking at me and my husband (who is gringo) like we were not welcome.  My husband had the enchilada burro which was just a tortilla with carne asada in a burrito and las palms enchilada sauce pored over it...he said it was ok ...not great. I had the sopes and they were okay but they had too much stuff on top which made it hard to eat.  I spoke to the one worker who spoke english so that he could pass it on to owner and he said \"Oh she's always like that\" well I believe in treating customers with a smile and with respect."}
{"text":"Food is really good but the wait is ridiculous especially through drive through it takes forever!!!'  They should really really work on that"}
{"text":"We eat Mexican food all over the valley, Sunnslope to Chandler and a few on the west side.  Grullo has the best bistek I've had. The nachos with green chili are my wifes favorite.  This is real Mexican food and affordable. for a comparison the bistek combo is $7.49. They serve Menudo and whole fried fish too."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often. They have a drive thru, and can be ordered through the Yelp! app as well as eat24. Its pick up only, but I'll usually submit my order while I'm down the street at QT gassing up, and by the time I'm done and I get there, I go through the drive thru and I'm good to go. I've literally ordered from this place at least 30 times, and never a complaint. Here's why I love them: soup (caldos) seven days a week!!! None of this \"menudo on sabado y domingo.\" Every day. I've had the menudo, albondigas, and cocido (caldo de res). The cocido takes me back to my moms cocido or going to a place in east LA by echo park that my mom liked. This is a good thing!! The albondigas has a wonderful broth, but I wish there was more meatballs in a serving. Menudo is also very good. I've also had the carne asada fries, fish, carne asada, barbecoa, chicken, chili verde, and carnitas either in burrito or taco form. The carnitas is the way I expect carnitas to be. Fried little porks. There's some places I've gone where I can't help but wonder if their owners knows how carnitas should be. The chili verde I've had twice. The first time was delicious, the second time was too spicy for me. I've had bariatric surgery and can no longer enjoy the majority of their menu; however, my biggest cheat is I will eat the tostada shells with the ceviche. I could eat it plain, either way it's good stuff, but I do indulge myself and since surgery I've probably ordered it three times a month for the last six months. Such a treat."}
{"text":"Good food, but what I love the most is that they have soups all week long!!! The best menudo in town!"}
{"text":"Wow.   Tacos are laughably small but so good and worth it.  Burritos are terrifyingly large. Also worth it.   I have nothing else to say. Order food from this place."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! They have a huge variety of meats. Had the al pastor, carnitas, and birria. Best pastor I've ever had, very flavorful with little bits of char on the pork. Carnitas was delicious and nicely crisp. Birria was also great, the flavor of the goat really came through (it was a pleasant surprise to see goat on the menu).   There's a nice salsa bar with green & red salsas, limes, cabbage, onions with cilantro, etc. The red sauce that comes with orders is quite hot - a little goes a long way. Can't wait to come back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. The guy who runs it is really nice. They catered at my sisters wedding! Always fresh and good prices but it's just fantastic. Definitely has a good taste that stands out from regular places"}
{"text":"I came here ordered shredded beef and a chicken burrito takeaway, both were,well cooked. Beef was a bit bland so I added hot sauce I have. I spent $15 which is fair and everything was a,smooth transaction. I really like the fact they have radishes here and they test great on beef burrito."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Grullos after our favorite spot closed early. The wait was a bit long but well worth it. The food smelled amazing when they passed it thru the drive thru window (bonus! They have a drive thru)!!! Everyone loved their food. I ordered a shredded beef chimi and was so pleased with how good it was ! The baby liked her taco,  but wished it were crunchy! The camarones are so delicious as well!"}
{"text":"Food is still great. But owner can be a jerk if your white and speak english or even Mexican and speak English. He acts racist. He speaks Spanish to customers and if you speak English he tells you to learn Spanish. He will say the word in English and then tell you what it means in Spanish and insists you say the word or sentence after he says it. Happens every time I'm there. And he is a jerk about it  I just want to order my meal. We are in America. Not Mexico. Speak English to English speaking customers. I don't go to Mexico and insist they speak English to me."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican fast food restaurant in mesa,az It's 100% better than filibertos hands down! And the owners are so nice!"}
{"text":"Went initially for my wife because abondigas are of her comfort foods for being sick.  4.5 out of 5, good place to go give a shot.  Was not disappointed in the least.  Beans and salsas were fantastic, the portions were stellar, and my daughter destroyed a third of my chorizo breakfast burrito.  Will be back many more times."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their street tacos... Packed full of tender well seasoned meat. Their ceviche tostadas are amazing. One of my favorite things about this place is they give you all of the fixings in individual bags including chopped onions, cilantro, spicy carrots and jalape√±os, oregano without even having to ask. There are also three different kinds of salsa and they aren't stingy with them. The drive-through does take much longer than I'd like but I figure it's because the food is being freshly made. And I'm totally ok with that."}
{"text":"Best tacos al pastor I've had for a long time, everything else is pretty decent as well.  A dollar a piece for the tacos with all the stuff to go with it.  Call ahead and they'll have them ready for you.  I have to say I'm a regular now."}
{"text":"This little family place has a nice clean kitchen and legit Mexican food. I love their Torta Cubana, and \"shrimp cocktail\" They also have some \"gringo\" food items for the less adventurous. But if you come go big get something you've never had before!  Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!"}
{"text":"I hope the light rail construction doesn't hurt this place. The asada tacos were loaded with flavorful meat and no fuss!  The cubano torta was interesting- I guess a hot dog can make it better? My boyfriend loved the torta.. I finished my tacos before I remembered to take a picture! They were that good.."}
{"text":"This place is off the hooks! It might be dumpy looking from the outside, but they have great Mexican food!  I always seem to miss this place when I'm driving on Main Street due to the light rail construction, so keep your eyes open. I love that they serve breakfast all day which is quite lovely. I always get the egg and cheese burrito with chunks of avocado. I like that they don't use mashed up guacamole in there. Great stuff! Their Harina Fish Tacos are awesome too!"}
{"text":"El Grullo catered our daughter's reception and it was such a good decision! We ordered tacos for 250 people. The tacos came with 3 different meat choices, toppings, generous portions of rice and beans, generous amounts of 2 choices of salsa. Delivery was on time, communication was easy, food was delicious, portions were generous and the price was right. Everyone loved the food at the reception. Thank you El Grullo Restaurant! (I'm still enjoying some leftovers!)"}
{"text":"I'm from California and since moving to Arizona I haven't found any good authentic Mexican food everywhere I go it's just filiberto's  or some other ones that didn't fulfill my needs until I came to this place I will definitely come back and highly recommend"}
{"text":"All in all really good food nothing fancy but they have quick service and it's pretty authentic I have gotten to know the owner Oscar for the last several years he's very nice to me and my family. Never a problem with the food it's always good and very authentic if you're not looking for anything fancy and want reasonable prices this is a good place."}
{"text":"Best ceviche tostada's around! Also have amazing tacos. Your choice of about any kind of meat. AMAZING!!! And to the comment made below about the owner being a jerk to white people; as a while male frequent patron of Grullos that speaks no Spanish, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from the owner."}
{"text":"Only place open on New Years Day...so we decided to give it a try. So glad we did. Food was fresh and delicious. Service was great. They were very kind."}
{"text":"Muy Rico!  I got the enchilada burrito with shredded beef and LOVED it. So much flavor."}
{"text":"I love their pollo asada tacos and quesadilla- also bean and cheese burrito. They give you lots of good toppings for the tacos and the green salsa is really good too. Prices are perfect, try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"La comida es excelente, la raz√≥n por mi baja puntuaci√≥n es por el p√©simo servicio de la que parece ser√° supervisora la due√±a del lugar. Digo, si tienes negocio ati√©ndelo con gusto y si no tienes ganas de trabajar no vengas por qu√© espantas a la clientela. La tipa tiene una actitud horrible, atiende sin ganas, el tono de voz est√° de m√°s. Como dije buena comida, p√©simo servicio y lo peor es que es del personal l√≠der del lugar. Por lo menos yo, no regreso."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for a quick bite while we were in Mesa just for the night.  I ordered the fish tacos and a Birria taco.  My wife ordered the green chili pork burrito.  None of them tasted that good...compared to many similar taco joints I've been to in the past.  The fish tacos for instance simply had way too much stuff on top which made it difficult to eat.  Sorry this was a miss for us however I do give them at least 2 stars for packaging everything so nicely on our to-go order."}
{"text":"Another recommendation from my fine hotel staff. These two old Sikh's got their thumb on the pulse of the local eats hands down.  But, I can get Mexican food anywhere at home in Sacramento, but they said this place is very authentic and always busy...give it a try. That part of of Mesa is lined with Mexican food dives on both sides of the street. I guess I'll see what sets this place apart from the rest. Well, it did NOT disappoint. I had a chicken burrito & enchilada combo plate that came with beans and rice. The taste was NOT that of the typical dime a dozen Mexican food joints...it was quite different to my taste buds and a breath of fresh air for that something different. It was hands down some of the best Mexican food I've had in a LONG time and understood what set this place apart from the rest. I'll be sure to put this dive on the keeper list for any future visits to Mesa...or my possible relocation."}
{"text":"We were in Mesa at the Mesa Performing Arts center and decided we deserved a nice breakfast burrito.   We decided to be adventurous and set down the street and found El Grullo Restaurant. When we parked, the lot was busy which is always a great sign. We entered and walked toward the counter and noticed there was a great deal of choices. Which is also a good thing. We decided to order two egg, potato, and cheese breakfast burritos. There was a bar set up for salsa and other fixings. Everything looked fresh and delicious.   Now, if you read my other posts, you will know that I am an avid breakfast burrito eater. That being said, our burritos were delicious. They were hot and the tortilla was amazing. They are large too. I cut mine in half and shared with my daughter. She thought it was good too and she's a picky eater.   Hands down, this place was fantastic. I am glad that we ventured in."}
{"text":"After eight years and over 100 meals I ate here, I can say I have never had anything here that wasn't perfectly delicious! In the summer (when I'm working) I usually have their campachana a couple of times a week. No one else makes it this delicious! (I'm here having one now). They always give a very generous portion of shrimp and octopus. Mmm and always with a plentiful amount of creamy fresh ripe avocado. How do they manage to always have access to perfectly ripe avocados? Because in the store they are rarely ripe when you buy them. Lol I feel so good after eating their campechana!   And THEN, their fresas con crema (strawberries & cream)! No one makes that better either! (Except I myself because I make it with honey.)   They have a very diverse menu. They even have burria, which is great, just not quite as great as Adrian's. But I've been in love with this place for a long time and will undoubtedly continue to be a happy customer as long as these owners (it's a family business) are at the wheel."}
{"text":"Not very good. Lady behind the counter was really standoffish while I was asking my questions. Best part of the whole meal was the side of sliced avocado. Beans and rice were unflavorful and the beans taste canned. However they gave me a ton of food, so if you like quantity over quality this place might be good for you."}
{"text":"Came here with my 8 year old before a show at Mesa Arts Center, and the young man was easily bilingual which was good for this gringo. He took our order and we got our drinks. I had basic carne asada and the kid had bean and cheese burrito. It took a few minutes but it was all tasty and cheap. Everyone was very nice. Good meat on my burrito. Nothing too stringy or cooked wrong. I'd stop back."}
