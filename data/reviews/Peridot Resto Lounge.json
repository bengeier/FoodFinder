{"text":"I have been here three times. Everytime the service has been AWFUL. each time worst than the time before it. And everytime I was there, the place was empty and STILL the service was bad. Let me talk about the most recent time - July 7, 2012. There were 10 of us in the empty restaurant (with exception to one other table of 4) at 5:45pm. It took 20 minutes to get the three of us who ordered the drinks to be  brought over. It took over 30 minutes for half of our table to get our food. Another 10 minutes for the rest. And then they forgot one meal. He got his by the time we were finished eating. (might I remind you that the restaurant was empty with exception to one table). So I thought, you know what, maybe it's just that the kitchen was backed up..and the bartender sucks at pouring beer. But then when it came time to get the bill, it took the waitress 15 minutes. All you do is press print. Even if it is separate bills, they should have already been separated, after all you only have two tables, you had plenty of time to figure things out. The food was just OK, I got the spaghettini - it was lacking in veggies and was super dry. I am taking a stand and never going back. They took the one meal off the bill that came when we were finishing up, but otherwise, no one came by to apologize, and the server wasn't too empathetic. This was not unlike the first two times I've been here. I don't understand how they are still in business. Don't be fooled by the awesome decor and prime location. And anyway, it makes zero sense to have a three floor restaurant  - you're just setting yourself up to have poor service. Ugh. 

Positives: the fried cheese thing is pretty good. Nice decor. 
Also the first two times I was there, because it was for a birthday, and the second time a bachelorette, the manager tried to make it special by doing this dance thing with the bday gal/bachelorette. he blindfolded her and got someone to pour this drink into her mouth. It was weird...but I appreciated the effort. I'll take a free slice of cake next time instead."}
{"text":"This place has several things going for it: a lovely patio overlooking Bloor, Sapporo on tap, a menu that has something for everyone without disappointing anyone, and an ownership that cares how you are enjoying your experience. 

I believe the stars of the menu are the pastas, especially the goat cheese ravioli and the pappardelle. The scallops are properly prepared every time, and the kitchen is cool with you asking for a bit extra sauce, as most plates are not over-sauced. 

A comfortable place to go with a date, a group of girls, or for an after-work beer with the guys."}
{"text":"I'm truly on the fence about this restaurant. From the outside looking in, one would think that this was an exclusive restaurant for suits and people with bulging wallets alike, but it really isn't. 

Known more for it's lunch crowd, Peridot doesn't get all too crowded and is a good place to take maybe take your clients if they don't want to walk too far from that area, but for an evening out I'd opt out of this place.

With a safe menu featuring salmon; chicken; salads; soups; and so on, the food isn't stellar but it's not horrible at the same time. The atmosphere is slightly cold and unimaginative. The price is what you'd expect to pay at a joint like that and the wait staff is pleasant enough.

See what I mean by being on the fence?"}
{"text":"It is a pity that the outside construction is hiding this quiet oasis for food & drink in the busy Bloor/Yonge area. Food & service was ecellent, the only problem I was the only client in the place. Also has a nice upstairs protected patio. Hopefully when the street construction if completed this place will come back to life."}
{"text":"Things not to do as a restaurant: Serve nuts to someone who is allergic to them.  Serve food that is not fully cooked.  Serve noodles that are glued together by their starches and be known as an Italian restaurant.  

Yes, Peridot succeeded on doing all of the above.  The nut thing was unbelievable. My friend is allergic to nuts, and we all know nut allergies= life threatening, and she asked for no nuts.  What do they do? They serve the salad with a side of nuts.  I couldn't believe it. Secondly I ordered veal scaloppini. Mmm well...  the veal was very good but a very simple sauce composed of white wine, thyme and beurre manie, or a brown roux.  Very simple. My green beans were under-blanched, in other terms, they were raw. Kinda didn't enjoy that.  

Lastly my pappardelle noodles! Well, as an Italian restaurant I was expecting either noodles made from scratch or just really awesome yummy noodles. Unfortunately it was none of the above.  My noodles were glued together and cold! The oil or 'sauce' that they were  covered in was not tasty at all. 

To me this dish seemed more French than Italian.  Maybe I'm just picky because I went to chef school, but I know if I were a chef, I would not serve this to anyone, it's not okay, and it certainly isn't worth the price or even to be recognized as a 'haute cuisine' restaurant."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend NEVER coming here. The service started out ok, but then our server basically ignored us. Finally we get a drink order taken... Only to be left sitting for another 30min. We then had to track down our server and ask her to come take our order. Finally, order placed, and yet we wait again for another 50min for our food to come out. We have now been at the restaurant for 1.5hrs and only half of our 12 person party has had an appy. Gotta to say I was pretty damn HANGRY by this point and debating leaving to eat elsewhere. The worse part of this whole experience was that the servers just didn't seem to care one iota.

Oh and I should mention that the food was mediocre at best.

Would never come here again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Brought a group of young bay street professionals hoping to encounter a true resto lounge gem. Unfortunately we found ourselves at a poorly organized, uninspired menu hosted by some less than amicable staff.

The place wasn't full yet it took them 25 minutes to seat us; we even had a reservation.

Food was disappointing and special requests about our dishes were ignored; we were even brought the wrong dishes. If you can't remember - write it down!

Very disappointed. Won't be back. I miss 5ifth Elementt."}
{"text":"I think it's a pretty nice place. The short ribs are delicious, my girlfriend really loves their goat cheese ravioli. The service can be a little slow if you sit in the front area, and last time I was there the ceiling was dripping, but it's a pretty fancy-looking place and I've enjoyed it."}
{"text":"For seasons past I've been overlooking Peridot as a dinner party venue, mostly because the photos on their website are hideous. But finally the day came around where a social function called for my attendance. It would be bad politics if I didn't end up going, and so normally I purchased four tickets. A hundred dollars of my money contributing the victims of a particular disaster. But I like to think of it as--an evening with three chicks.

I neglected to review this place because I've only been here once up until a few days ago, and up until a few days ago I've had no food. 
Now that I have experienced Peridot in its full glory..may the hounds of my culinary snobbery be set free.
WHAT A PATHETIC MENU! It's as if the Mediterranean has all but exhausted their resources for over a century, and the chefs were devising the menu out of an encyclopaedia with most of it's pages missing. There is.....no food here. This sums up everything you need to know about dining at Peridot. Perhaps they've utilized so much of the real estate that they've forgot to build a kitchen.

The service between a bar and a restaurant are not things safely matched, and I don't think anyone's told the owners here. The only place the said combination where such concoction has found any success that I know of in Toronto is One Eleven, Yorkville. Peridot emphasizes Yorkville in it's advertisements again and again in propaganda vehicles such as Toronto Life magazine. But the location makes it seem more like it's Yorkville's younger and retarded cousin in the time-out corner. 
From the outside, this restaurant is beautiful. It looks as if it can stand next to any other restaurant on Cumberland, and the stretched marble stairs ascending to the entrance suggests delusions of grandeur. But upon entering, you realize that it is nothing but just delusions. The interior is like a Malibu mansion that would house the likes of Kid Rock, or Akon (if he were a bit poorer). I'd live here, but I wouldn't eat here.
The furniture doesn't match, and it's not eclectic. It really is like a candyhouse for adults, where from the outside it's all alluring, but once inside we find out that it's just something of a sinister pretentiousness. 
The art on the walls seemed to be acquired from the sets of an ironic film about modern day bourgeois lifestyles of the 'new money'.

I ordered my 'usual' drink here which came out to be $22 a glass. I'm not drinking 50 years old scotch or anything. $22! It makes the $15 price at ONE restaurant seem reasonable. Including tips, that would be $100 for four drinks. ARE THE ICE CUBES CARVED FROM GLACIERS?!?!
I spent $300+ here during the fundraiser just on drinks. Somebody better offer me some unprotected sex before I call my 'boys' over here for such theft! 

There's a balcony bar here, looking at the most mundane view of all Bloor Street East. 

My instincts told me not to come here, I'll be treating my instincts with much greater trust and respect from now on.

Peridot is my birthstone, I had this unending argument with my friend on the pronunciation of Peridot. She keeps pronouncing it 'peridoe'. Somebody correct her!"}
{"text":"We went to Peridot for my mother-in-law's birthday dinner last week.

Here is the breakdown of our experience:

Service:
Amazing.
We had 2 waitresses who were taking care of us and both of them were just so nice and polite. They came on a regular basis to see how we were doing and they were even trying to joke around with our 2-year old son.
We had a TeamBuy voucher for our meal and it was no issue at all.
They honored it with a smile.
At the end of the meal, someone from management (maybe the owner even?) came to our table to inquire if we enjoyed our meal and that everything was to our satisfaction.
Nice touch!

Decor:
Meh.
Very modern look, but it felt kinda cold to me. I was not a big fan.

Food:
Here is where it gets interesting cause not all the diners in our group share the same opinion.

We had the Mini Spinach & Cheese Pita Puffs as a starter to share. 
There were quite enjoyable.

As for the main course: 
My father-in-law had the Spaghettini, my mother-in-law ordered Halibut Fish & Chips and my husband and I both had the Lamb Burger with Yukon Gold Frites.

The in-laws loved their food. 
FIL cleared his plate so fast that nobody even got to try his pasta. lol
MIL's fish was actually really nice. The batter wasn't too heavy and the fish tasted really fresh.
As for the burgers... They were OK. But nothing to write home about. And we felt that the fries were kind of meh.. not crispy, no real flavor.. I don't even know how to describe them... 
Our son tried 2 and that was it. Even with ketchup he didn't want to eat any more. That's not a good sign. :/

Another thing I have to mention about their food: The portion sizes were a bit small.
For what they are charging I had expected more."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  I too had a voucher for this resto, and given my experience there I think it was quite the steal.

For starters, all of our dishes were delicious.  As appetizers we ordered a side tomato/cucumber salad ($6) and a potato soup.  For our mains my friend had the linguini pasta with chicken, while I had a daily special -- the beef tenderloin with mash potatoes and beans.  Every bite was like an explosion of flavour.  My only criticism was that the mash potatoes were a bit on the salty side.

For dessert we had a piece of tiramisu cake.  The waitress said that most of the desserts were made in-house.  The tiramisu certainly was, and it rivaled my Italian mother's home-made version.  Delicious!

I'd certainly go back here.  Prices are very reasonable given the quality and portions of food."}
{"text":"Three things come to mind when I read the reviews of this place here on Yelp. 

1-) The better the place, the less they need to sell vouchers
2-) Most of the better reviews are from members who had vouchers. 
3-) It is a known fact people are more forgiving on a locale when their bill has been subsidized. I mean, in the end, why can you not  forgive issue 'XYZ'? It's not like you are paying full price for it, no?

Like a few of you, when you first pass by you think to yourself, \"Mmm, that place looks huge, expensive, exclusive and interesting!\" Unfortunately, like cow tipping, Peridot sounds a lot more interesting than it actually is.

Let's see, even though Peridot is right next to Yonge and Bloor which is the center of Toronto, the place is always empty. I went there twice to find information regarding possibly booking a party and the place was deserted, with maybe 6 customers in the entire locale. 

Honestly, I was left wondering of how exactly do they pay their rent because there is no way they would do that with the clientele I saw. When I asked them, they said \"by booking a lot of corporate events.\" Okay. Fair.  Still for such a large two-story venue to be empty during the day, well, something did not quite sit right with me. 

Now, I ended up booking my Christmas party there last year since it was centrally located, however I must admit it was a mistake. As someone mentioned before, they try to be a Resto during the day and a lounge at night. However, I think Peridot flops at both. 

The place is modern looking to the point of coming off as sterile, and it does not welcome one to sit down and eat. Maybe more for a drink or two.

Now as far as the lounge part, they DO NOT have a DJ, even though they triumph their lounge at the back to be a great place to dance. Well, it is not when the music is coming out off weak speakers AND a local radio station and thus limited to well, coming out of a local radio station. You want music, you have to bring your own DJ. So this place is not so much a lounge but a large room for you to book parties at. There is a difference.  I would not have cared so much if they had not assured me that music would not be a problem. When in the end it was.

Also, in a move of great douchebaginess, they do/claim to have the policy to only serve you draft beer until 10:00pm, after that, they will only sell you beer by the bottle which goes for about the same price as a pint. Not only it is a blatant & classless attempt at upping their profit margin but it would have been extremely helpful to share this during my FAQ with them and before I booked my party of 40 people.

Luckily for me, we still ended up having a great time, even if we didn't dance much and were against the cheap hinjinks this locale was throwing at us with their subpar service. 

Having said that, I keep telling myself that I should drop by, you know, to just get a pint and check this place out on my own, just sit at their bar and get a 2nd feel for it, however, I can't seem to muster up the desire to give them any of my money."}
{"text":"I always wondered what kind of place this was, since I walk by it pretty often. After dining here, I've come to conclusion this place is a birthday dinner venue. The decor is really pretty, I love the all white with white flowers and yellow candlelight. I might even celebrate my birthday later into the year here if I don't find another place that can hold 15 + people without cramming anyone else because this place is huge. Feels like there's 3 different areas, the back, the front and upstairs. I only seen the downstairs. I should check out upstairs to see if it's as pretty as the front. 

The menu looks good, I haven't tried too many things but they have a lot of options for carnivores and vegetarians. Pretty good wine list too if your quite specific with your grapes. 

We ordered the bruschetta and calamari for apps, the table comes with bread and butter. Bruschetta tasted great. They filled it pretty good so kindof embarrassing to eat LOL. The calamari was good. Nothing bad or special, no complains towards it. 

I can't remember my friends dish but mine was goat cheese ravioli, I have a feeling it would've tasted amazing if the pasta was cooked a bit longer because it was pretty hard, the filling and sauce were tasty tho so I can imagine if it was cooked all the way thru it would've been a great dish. 

I need to go back and try more menu items to get a feel for this place properly and see its potential for le birthday dinner."}
{"text":"If looking for a good place for happy hour in the Yorkville area, look no further.
All drinks are on special from 5-7 Monday to Friday, and they have a snack menu where all apps are half price including rather delicious lamb sliders, sweet potato fries, flat bread pizzas, and a few other tasty options.

I've never come here for a proper meal, but if the happy hour food and drinks is anything to base opinion on, I'm impressed. The owner Franco has even gone out of his way a couple times to make sure our group is well taken care of, so I'll give this place an enthusiastic two thumbs up and a recommendation that its a safe bet for stopping in during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Ummm...I'm embarassed to say I went here. That is the best way of describing my night.

Ok look. Its was a friend of a friend's party. We were told to meet at Peridot, and that it was a lounge. The location seemed...not so happening (Bloor East is ~quiet at night). The first thing that got me was the $20 cover! Was not expecting to pay to get into a lounge.

Anyhoo we carried on inside. Coat check was $3. Because I was already annoyed at the cover, I chose to hang onto my coat (I think sub-conciously I knew I wasn't going to stay all night).

My first reaction was 'oh this is an Asian bar'. I would say this because....99% of people there were Asian. And perhaps....10 years my junior? I recognized ~70% of the girls outfits from Forever21 (including my own!). 

So...my friend and I awkwardly hung out, waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. While waiting we got a couple drinks (very slow service, took ~15min for service and the bar wasn't really busy). Then we danced a bit. For the life of me, I could not find anywhere to put my coat. Everywhere seemed to be 'reserved'. I am not kidding. I was even thought of putting it on the floor (its not a fancy coat) but feared someone would come tell me to move it. In fact, later on in the night one of the workers came by and insisted we check our coats and that it was house rules! Lol, instead we stashed them on the floor near a reserved seating area. I was so nervous, they kept coming by to look at our coats!

Oh..I almost forgot to mention the music. It was HILARIOUS. I'm talking Montel Jordan, Aaliyah...total throwback to early 2000's. Considering this music would date back to my undergrad days, the majority of clients there wold be too young to recognize it. Who exactly where they catering their music to? Why were people so into dancing to it? Puzzling.

We ended up leaving around 1230am..I couldn't handle it anymore. The anxiety of the 'coat checkers' mixed with bad music, was too much for me. My friend instantly agreed to leave. I think that said it all.

There is no way I'm going back to Peridot. Its pretty $$ (cover, mandatory coatcheck, drinks $8) for what you get"}
{"text":"I bought a deal for this restaurant which prompted me to invite my girls and their dates along for a chatty dinner.

Before going I read some reviews and was kind of apprehensive about the food, especially papardella. 

BUT after arriving a bit late at 7:45 because of crazy Leafs traffic 9there and back) i was kind of rushing because when we called to say we were going to be late, the hostess informed us they will be closing at 9pm for a 'greek\" party. 

But we left at 9:30 and they was nothing in site except for the diners still there.

There is a lounge in the back that my husband Matthew M. saw on the way to their washroom, which he described as being nice.

On to their food, we ordered calamari (YUM) and spinach and cheese puffs (DBL YUM) to share. Both were great choices and were mentioned in previous reviews (thx yelp)

I also had their Mesclun salad which was only okay, a little bland and oily for my taste, but that could be the fact that I'm not crazy about roasted red peppers.

I also had their wild mushroom soup which some people said was okay but I liked it, warm and mushroomy and creamy.

Finally our mains: 

I had the beef ribs with one of my gfs with some beans (was a bit over cooked) and those amazing sweet potato fries. Beef ribs were not as juicy as I like but the taste was ok, I added hot sauce to amp it up a bit but since my hubby doesn't eat spicy (willingly) he found it bland.

Hubby had steak with yukon fries/beans as well. Steak was yummy to me, he didn't like it as much. fatty pieces and charred nicely (medium rare) Blue cheese definitely added a nice touch.

Another gf had the pappardelle which got bad reviews, but it was YUMMY, I'm a pasta eater and love it! Not too much sauce but enough for a creamy goodness. Pasta was not over cooked and everything just went well. She also had a Gemtini (January) which looked good.

Her bf had halibut fish and chips, which he said was okay but the shoe string fries was not fish and chip quality!

I was the only one attempting dessert after so i got the passion fruit cheese cake, it was yummy and cheese cakey but not different enough for me to rmm it next time, maybe tiramisu.

Service was decent, friendly but not always available and there is only about 10 table which was filled at the time.

I would definitely go again to stay for their lounge but without a coupon the $28 steak could put you back a bit."}
{"text":"Peridot is one of those weird animals that sells itself as a fancy dining lounge by day and evening, but wants to be a late night party spot for the trendy Yonge and Bloor crowd. I would say it only succeeds in doing the latter. 

I've partied here many nights; Halloween, work parties, social gatherings. And I have to say I've never had a bad time. There is tons of space; a uncovered patio outside, a dance floor and bar upstairs, a bar and lounge area downstairs more lounge seating near the front of the bar. It has that dark, classy ambiance and drink prices to match. You won't get any drink specials here but the crowd is fun and young and the music is always great. 

I would recommend this for anyone who wants to get away from the Richmond Street club scene and find a more sophisticated place to party!"}
{"text":"I had a voucher at this restaurant and I found the overall experience to be wonderful and more than what I expected. Prices were average.

I went on a Friday night with my friend. The staff were very friendly, overall atmosphere was lovely but upstairs lounge looked a lot more elegant than the downstairs where we were seated. We ordered calamari, spinach and cheese puffs and the bruschetta as well. For our entrees we had the lamb burger and the portobello mushroom chicken. Overall, the food was delicious and we would come back again to try different dishes we missed out on.

We were too full to try the dessert but our next trip there we will definitely not fill up on the appetizers. The one item that stood out the most were the spinach and cheese puffs, they were different and very good. We would definitely come again, this place does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Located just of east of Yonge and Bloor, narrowly missing the heavy traffice, Peridot is a swanky-looking restaurant/lounge conveniently located above a basement-level pub*. Its tall ceilings, minimalistic decor and bright lights ooze charm.

My partner and I came here one Friday evening because I had a LivingSocial coupon in hand - $30 worth of food for the price of $15. We'd arrived around 5 pm, and although it was pretty early for the evening, the place was dead. We ordered an extra-spicy Bloody Mary - since the Clamato's isn't exactly vegetarian-friendly - and it was a pleasant surprise. Normally we'd get appetizers, but since we were in a time crunch, ended up going for two entrees: goat cheese ravioli with sweet peppers, mushrooms, sage white wine butter and herbed ricotta ($15) and the tagliatelle - grilled eggplant, sweet peppers, red lentils, capers, kalamata olives, plum tomato, chili, basil, arugala, lemon extra virgin olive oil ($13). 

While both sounded fantastic by description alone, the actual dish did no justice to the name. The sage white wine butter was more like a pool of pasta water that hadn't been properly drained; as the waitress set the dish down, the liquid sloshing around was immediately noticeable. There wasn't much sage taste, although I could see large slivers of it in my dish. It was fine, but simply disappointing and not bad enough to send back to the kitchen. The tagliatelle was also a let-down; while the ingredients sounded like a delicious combination, it seemed as if the vegetables were lacking and there was something not quite right about it.

We seemed to be the only customers eating here, except for a steady stream of women and men in business attire headed straight to the bar in the back. While I only passed through the bar area to access the washroom, the back room looked a bit worn. There were several tall drink tables and stools, but large empty spaces around the corners which made it feel very awkward. The regulars, however, didn't seem mind; they made themselves at home - someone had their Blackberry charging on a cardboard box, the phone charged to an outlet in the wall - and seemed to know the staff by a first-name basis. 

Seems like this used to be a happening place, but when a business is selling Groupon copycats, it's an indication that something's gone wrong. Every single staff member I talked to or passed by seemed genuinely attentive and we left the waitress a decent tip. The real problem here is the food; they should either retrain or rehire their kitchen staff if they want their business to survive. 

As Gorden Ramsey would point out, keep your menu small and of what you've got on it, make sure you excel at it and flaunt it well. Peridot, I'm sad to say, is already flunking that simple little rule. 

*The pub downstairs is named The Spotted Dick. My partner, while nestling a beer and waiting for my arrival, heard a few guests of the Marriott complaining about the quality of the food in the restaurant upstairs."}
{"text":"- Balsalmic grilled calamari on a bed of mushroom ragout with caramelized onions.  It's as good as is sounds. 

- The staff is very attractive...and attentive, all in a professional way. 

- The main levels opens up to a nice Bloor St breeze, perfect for those who don't want full-on patio sun-induced sweating during a business meeting. As others have noted, the behemoth that is the Marriott blocks any kind of view.."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Flavourful pasta and fish that was not overcooked or overseasoned.  Salad was a little bland, but did complement the flavours of my rigatoni.  Quiet ambience that would have a nice people-watching view of Bloor Street if it weren't for the construction outside.  Cool looking lounge in the back that I may have to come back to and visit on a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 but if I had to choose between 3 and 4 it's closer to a 3 for me (no rounding up here). The service was average. The food was ok. The expensive steak I had for lunch left me wanting more. It wasn't good value and it wasn't even a good steak. I don't really remember much else about the food, clearly it didn't leave an impression. They try to be healthy which is what attracted me to this place. The decor is nice. I don't really see myself going out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"I was here for their Pride brunch menu on the balcony to watch the parade with friends, so my review probably isn't the most representative of what you'd typically get here.

I was surprised at how vast the interior of Peridot is compared to its unassuming facade.  The seating inside is substantial, which I guess lends itself better to its nightlife aspirations.  In any case, the balcony was perfectly situated to watch the parade, and the ambience was likely atypically boisterous and jubilant.  Staff were introducing tables to each other and contributing to the overall mood well.  

The food was a little underwhelming for the price point.  I ordered a pistachio-crusted goat cheese appetizer, which was much smaller than I anticipated, accompanied by three or four crostinis, three pita wedges, and a few dipping items (a currant mixture, a strawberry-type preserve, three or four roasted garlic cloves).  Particularly since it was a reduced event-specific menu, one would expect them to bring only their star players to the table.  Some of the other items looked a bit more favourable but surely wouldn't speak necessarily to the skill of the staff--sweet potato fries, for example.  

All in all I wasn't encouraged to return for their regular menu--but the patio might be a good option if you're in the Bloor area on a summer evening and don't feel like fighting for a seat over at Hemingway's or on Church."}
{"text":"Good service. Poor food.  I had the paparadelle. It was awful because the taste was way too strong. The Chicken Supreme was pretty bad too since it was too bland. The spinach cheese puffs and grilled calamari were decent. Overall not worth the money and we used a voucher!"}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, it's really a shame that construction has been going on for ages at Yonge and Bloor because Peridot is really missing out on any passerby customers. 

It's a a really cool space inside with restaurant seating downstairs and a really neat lounge area upstairs, complete with a fair sized dance floor and patio overlooking Bloor. I really like the decor, it's a bit swanky but nothing too pretentious. 

I have been here for a private event and the food and service was excellent. Also been for just drinks and had a great time too. The music is fun and it's all in all a cool place to check out."}
{"text":"I actually give Peridot 2.5/5 stars.

According to all the reviews everyone experienced Peridot as a restaurant and not as a lounge/bar. My friend held her 23rd birthday here last night with bottle service. You would assume that at least x amount of people would get free cover since we had bottle service. Nope, everyone had to pay a cover of $15. That is insane! $15 is wayyy too much when it's only 11:30 and it's not even a club. You would also assume that you can leave your jackets in your booth but nope we had to pay for coat check of $3. So just by entering I already had to spend $18. 

As we walked in I noticed that 99% of the crowd was Asian. Although I am asian I don't like to be partying with mostly asian people. The music was great throughout the night, ranging from mostly hip hop to some pop songs. At first not many people were dancing but as the night progressed more people started to dance.

I never bought any drinks at the bar so I don't know if the drinks are pricey or not.

Their washrooms are small and only has 3 stalls. It was pretty gross with girls throwing up and the birthday girl throwing up in one of the sinks. Blech!

Overall, it was a pretty good night and it cost me $43 (cover, coat check, bottle service).

Would I go here again? Nope, not my type of crowd.

Note: Clubs/lounges that are promoted by Marquee Media tend to draw out the asian crowds."}
