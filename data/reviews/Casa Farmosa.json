{"text":"Dropped by Pacific Mall and tried this restaurant for the first time. 

Ordered fried rice and it came with soup and soy drink. Both the fried rice and soup was very good. Great value and terrific place to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"Delicious, huge portions and cheap! What more can you ask for ;) Ordered the stir fried rice noodle with beef ($6.50+tax). Not too greasy-just right with a hint of wok-taste. It came with a small bowl of soup and a cup of homemade soy milk."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, delicious, and cheap meal. 

Their popcorn chicken is really good; comparable to the Taiwanese restaurants. I've also had their deep fried tofu which is a guilty pleasure of mine. 

Generous portions and I love that all their meals come with some side dishes like eggplant, potato, green beans, and cabbage. 

The owner is really sweet and her son who's like 8 sometimes helps out. 

Try the sweet and sour sauce that's offered at their counter!"}

Tones of flavour 
Easy on the pocket

Enjoyed their sweet and sour chicken with a drink for just over $8.

It's in a little busy food court within Pacific mall and popular with all it seems"}
