{"text":"Overpriced. I occasionally go here for lunch with the combo costing about $10.00. The combo consists of a maki tray (salmon rolls or california rolls) and spicy chicken. This combo was once $8.25 a few years ago. Also, the spicy chicken is always weighed, dry, chewy, and kind of gross. The rolls are decent. Everything else is ridiculously overpriced (deluxe rolls $9, sashimi combo with 6 pieces for $12). Would not recommend unless you really need a sushi fix."}
{"text":"Clean & tasty.. Good choice for a quick lunch or take-out at the reasonable price!! Smiling faces are the bonus.. What else you need?"}
{"text":"This place is getting popular!!!   Salmon are fresh and the price given its location is unbeatable!   I guess the place is getting busy and the variety gone down..the chap chae (Korean glass noodle) dish is gone :(  Trust me on this the chap chae + the normal salmon sushi is cheaper than the 6.95 combo.. the spicy chicken might not be the most healthy dish at times..  I have to admit that I am a fan on Mr Sushi!"}
{"text":"We stopped by again to grab a quick lunch.  We got 4 boxes with salmon/avocado sushi and tuna/avocado sushi  (= 32 pieces) and the total came to $19.  They also gave us a miso soup for free."}
{"text":"Well made sushi for a takeout joint, generous with the filling and easy on the rice. 20% off after 330pm."}
{"text":"I just ordered the spicy chicken/sweet potato fry special. There is no nutritional value whatsoever, the fries are tempura. Even though it's a huge portion, you will get sick if you eat this.  I should know better because everyone from work eats here, and the food is not that appetizing.   It's cheap and a large portion.  No idea why the line-ups are so long, reaffirms the fact people in Toronto are absolutely clueless about food.  It's been less than an hour later, and I feel so sick.  I will throw the rest of the potato fries out.  What a waste of my money!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:  I came here for lunch on a weekday with a coworker, which is exactly the type of crowd that comes here. Food is pre-made and packaged in to-go containers, which you select and bring to the cash register. All items do not come with soy sauce already on them (woo hoo), but of the few hot food items they have available, most were breaded (womp womp). They did not have gluten-free soy sauce so you're eating your sushi as-is.   I got two packs of nigiri - one assorted container and one of just salmon. Each contained 8 pieces and were priced at about $7 each. The fish tasted surprisingly ok for the price point - not terrible but not the best I had. The rice though was meh. It was just plain rice, not delicious sushi rice.   TL;DR sushi is decent but nothing special"}
{"text":"Change in ownership or management?? have no clue the friendly woman who would greet you with \"How you doing?\"  is gone.  Brown rice rolls which were once on par with white rice rolls have gone up in price and the rolls are ridiculously small for the $6.00 I paid.  Also was charged for Miso soup which is usually complimentary with your purchase. Existing staff look miserable.  Will start looking for another place to get my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Oh no. Sadly, this ended up being sushi I regretted purchasing. Located just south of Toronto St. and Adelaide St. East, I came by around 12:30 PM to quickly pick up a roll or some other eats for lunch. It was relatively busy, but not terribly so. I thought this would be a good spot to grab something without the notoriously long lines you'd find in the Financial District's food courts, but unfortunately, after having a taste of what I bought, I was better off with food court sushi, to be honest.  I purchased a spicy salmon roll, which came to a little over $6.00. In terms and texture and taste, it felt like it was days old. The salmon wasn't fresh and the fish instead tasted almost... crunchy? It was very chewy and very difficult to eat. It was to the point that the fish tasted almost gamey. Not tasty at all, sadly.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stomach the rest of the roll and could only eat about 4 pieces of the 8. Perhaps this was an anomaly as they have a number of other items on their menu (also note, this is mostly a takeout spot), but I'm not sure I'd come back, as there are a number of other (better) lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"The best rolls in Toronto! A bit overpriced but it is really worth it Volcano roll my favourite"}
{"text":"Cheapest sushi you will find in downtown Toronto. You can get their lunch special, which is veggie dumplings and delicious salmon roll, for just $6.75 (including taxes). There is a super friendly lady at the counter. One time I went really late for lunch and they didn't have any sushi left but they made a roll for me. You can watch them making the sushi. Also they give you free miso soup although thats not something I would care about. The sushi is good for its price."}
{"text":"I work around the corner so Mr Sushi is my go to for take out sushi. It's very good for take-out and MAKE SURE you get the spicy chicken! The spicy salmon roll is good too! Fairly priced and if you go after three it's 30% off or something. Also, they have a little loyalty card so every time you go for sushi, make sure you get it stamped for free sushi"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its located on Toronto Street, (just a few steps west of Church Street on the north side of King) This is a great place to have a great lunch in the $5 to $10 range. The sushi dishes come with free Miso soup, and there are several lunch specials including sushi, sashimi, spicy chicken and pork dishes. Its a small place with limited seating but the food here is fresh, and the service here is fast and friendly. The menu is limited here, but its definitely one of the best sushi take-out joints in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp combo w/ spicy chicken. MEH. For $9, it was mediocre. Would not come back."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times to grab sushi on my way home. There are combos for under 6$ with a  good portion size ( If you want to pig out then go to an AYCE place) . It is an excellent deal  considering  there are not many useful options  serving fresh meals at the same price. They have some dumplings, and unique dishes I have seen on the  menu and plan to try ."}
