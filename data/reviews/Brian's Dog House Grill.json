{"text":"For any Western New Yorkers who have relocated here, you have to check this place out.  I moved from Buffalo 12 years ago, and have been waiting for someone to introduce Sahlens hot dogs to the south.  Got a foot long, just like Ted's!  I would make sure you ask for it well done, as any hot dog undercooked is not good.  Also, got some curly fries, yum!

They make sandwiches with rolls from Costanzo's bakery, which is a well known western NY bakery, and they make the subs great!   

They also serve Loganberry!!  For those who do not know what Loganberry is, it is a sweet,berry flavored non-carbonated drink that is quite popular in WNY.  Honestly, I have no idea what an actual \"Loganberry\" is (ok, it does not exist) but the drink sure tastes good!  Brought me back to childhood......

They even sell Weber's Mustard, another WNY treat!

Did not get to try the wings, but from the looks of them, they looked good, and they make the wings with Frank's hot sauce which is a good sign.

Not sure why all the whining by others over price, if you want dirt cheap, go to Mc Donalds.

Now just waiting for Brian to make a \"Chicken Finger Sub\" the way Johns in Buffalo does..........."}

{"text":"My husband and I decided to try out Brian's Dog House Grill as takeout, expecting a cheap, quick meal.  We got the quick, but the cheap...not so much.  A little overpriced for what it is.

However, my biggest issue was that when we got home, we discovered that they didn't bother to take off the mustard from one of our hot dogs, which we had DEFINITELY requested.  It's pretty much impossible to remove mustard from a hot dog, so...meh.  Worse, the fries were burnt.  Really burnt.  When I pulled them out of the bag, I even had to ask if they were fries.  They were dark brown, almost black!  We tried to eat them, but ended up throwing them away after a bite or two.  I'm amazed that anyone tried to serve them.  Guess it's our fault for not looking in the bag to check the order, but still....not a great first impression.

I'm not in a big rush to hurry back.  If I ever did, I'd definitely check the bag and/or dine-in to make sure the order was right."}
{"text":"Fried pickles were the bomb dot com!"}
{"text":"Took my family and some friends to The Dog House today!  Great meal and good prices.  The lunch special provided many options for $4.99.  It included fries and a drink.  The free ice cream was a favorite for the kids too!  I met the owner, Brian, who was very busy making the place run smoothly. I sat at a table that needed to be cleaned and was waiting to ask someone to clean it, but in less than 2 minutes Brian noticed it needed cleaning and wiped it down.  Would definitely eat there again!  Good luck Brian!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Great tasting dog"}
{"text":"Drove here only to be presented with a \"Closed for vacation\" sign. Seriously??? Terrible business practice."}
{"text":"Stick with just dogs & fries.  But don't get excited these dogs are NOT Nathan's or Sabrett's.."}
{"text":"Amazing how many people don't understand food! Check it out , here is a real review from someone that knows what good food and a real restaurant experience should be. 
Basic burgers and dogs here but they are excellent quality! Fries are fresh and taste as well. Make sure to try loganberry drink also.
Service is top notch and the place is clean.
Prices are high...this is the reason I don't go often...but then again, I don't know of a place where u can get this kinda stuff around here.  It would get an extra star if prices were lower and another if they had a more expansive menu.

Bottom line: Brian's has some really good food.  If you think mickey d's or wendys is quality food then you wont understand a place like this but if you want a meal fit for a person and not an animal then come have lunch/dinner....or get delivery."}
{"text":"Alright, so I lived in WNY for 10 years from 1990-2000.  The local hot dog choice up there is Sahlen's, which honestly I never really liked too much (unlike Nathan's and others, Sahlen's comie in casings - made from tongues, plus they use nitrates).  However, just about every place up there actually chargrills them, which is something you don't see too much elsewhere.  They are also usually served as \"Texas Red Hots\", but that doesn't mean they have hot sauce on them.  They are served with a thick red sauce that doesn't have any spice to it.  That's what Brian's Dog House makes.  Upon entering the place, you see the charcoal fired grills behind the counter, just like places like Ted's in WNY.  \"Brian's\" is not the first place in the area to offer Sahlen's, but they are the first one to focus on them as their main menu item.

The menu offers many things that Buffalo area transplants will recognize.  Chicken finger subs, steak in the grass sandwiches, steak and cheese hoagies, and even Loganberry - a sweet beverage.  Contrary to a previous review, loganberry is a real berry.  It's a hybrid of raspberries and blackberries, although I'm not sure if the drink is actually made with real loganberries (probably not).  

I had the steak in the grass sandwich.  What is that?  It's grilled steak patties (not steak umms) served wit spinach, tomatoes, mayo, and melted mozzarella.  While the flavor was good, the patties were a bit thick.  I believe it was previously frozen, but was good nonetheless. The rolls also come from a famous bakery in WNY called Costanzo's.  It is where just about every pizza and sub place in Buffalo gets there rolls and they are good.  They also ship them to businesses, as they do here.  I believe that again, they are probably shipped frozen, which actually isn't too bad for bread. I also had curly fries, which were fresh, fried, and good, even without seasoning.  My dad got a Buffalo cheeseburger which came with bleu cheese and Frank's hot sauce.  He said that was good because it was cooked on the open flame, but it was also likely frozen.  He also had some fried pickles.  They were spears with a nice batter on them.  

Brian's also offers Carolina dogs and burgers, as well as veggie burgers, which you can also get with veggie bacon.  I know some initial reviews said the prices were high, but they are actually not bad - especially when comparing them with some places I've been in WNY over the past few years.  The wings and fingers now come with potato buttons, and they also offer combos now.  However, they still charge 50 cents fro a to go cup if you dine in and then want to take your drink to go. I don't normally get to go cups because I try to be conscious of the environment.  However, just about every restaurant in the area gladly offers to go cups for free.  It's probably not wise to lose a potential lifetime customer over something that costs them no more than a dime.  

The bottom line is that this place will definitely satisfy most WNY transplants.  Whether it has local appeal or not will be based on personal preferences of locals as well as transplants from other cities.  I will also say that everyone working was really friendly.  They offered us each a free ice cream cone, but we were stuffed."}
{"text":"Hot dogs and burgers. That's what's assumed from the name, right? Well, you got it. Nothing on the menu really deviates from that. The location is in a great part of Rosedale and the interior decoration is simple. Nothing too outlandish or tacky. 

Upon walking in, you take a look at the spacious menu on the wall and take your pick. The selection is simple and has no distinctive dogs or burgers that you can't find anywhere else. Brian, the owner of course, states that the dogs and burgers have a signature taste due to their hickory bricks. No gas or propane used here for grilling. Everything is served hot and fresh to you. Drinks for some reason are served behind the counter, so I found that a little counterintuitive to most dog joints. Found it inconvenient having to wait to get my drink filled during the lunch time rush. 

Their dogs I must say do come from a family owned butcher shop back in New York. And there is a big difference in the taste. I had the Polish Sausage and it was packed with spices and seasoning.. No fillers and it had a crisp texture. About an inch and a quarter diameter, so it was a pretty good size. The price was almost $5 for the dog alone and that kind of hurt to be honest. Quality comes with price. The combo meal, an extra $3.50, comes with fries and a drink. The fries are also cut and made fresh. A bit steep in my opinion however. The whole meal cost a whopping $9.50 almost. Kinda hurt. 

Service here is excellent though. So, that's a major plus. I gave the place 3 stars due to the price. If it was a bit lower I would love to give it a four due to the local business and supporting a mom and pop butcher shop back in NY. 

Don't get me wrong though. Brian's is good, but the price will make some leery."}
{"text":"I definitely agree the price is a little too far north for comfort, but it wasn't so outrageous either.  Two hot dogs and a milk shake came to a little over $10.  The hot dogs were hot and tasted very good, especially the chilli-cheese dog.  The Texas dog was ok, but I expected a little bit more than just the chilli type topping on it.  It took a little while to prepare but the workers were all very friendly and helpful.  The place appeared to be very clean also, which is always appreciated.  The only downsides besides price are that the milkshake is flavored with syrups, which I generally try to avoid, and the bun of one of the hotdogs did fall apart before the first bite.  The hotdog was still quite tasty, but it required utensils to consume.  Going against the plurality of negative reviews, I will recommend this place based on the good service, cleanliness, and the fact that hot dogs tasted pretty good when I ate them."}
{"text":"Good place for a tasty hot dog. Grilling the hotdog did creat a good flavor."}
{"text":"Used to be much much much better. They have changed a lot the menu and probably they were going out of business so they decided to take a few things out of the menu and raise the prices. This also means I am not a loyal customer anymore. I used to go at least twice a month and now I rarely go.

The dogs and burgers are fresh and taste really good, however, for this price tag I would still prefer to go to Five Guys which has similar food. I love to support local business, but after the price increase and removal of items I just decided to not patronize anymore."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs & fries. I also like the free ice cream. The owner and staff are super nice and best of all they deliver to my house!!"}
{"text":"Great food for northerners who miss high quality hot dogs and a variety of choices! They also have excellent milk shakes and other menu items."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our twin grandchildren 8 years old there yesterday.  Worst hot dogs (burnt), chicken nuggets with a corn meal crust and polish sausage very dry and tasteless we've ever had.  Left most of it.   Curly fries were soft and mushy.  None of it was worth eating.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Sign in the door today reads \"Coming Soon:  DUCK DONUTS\"  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I attempted to grab a hotdog here a couple of times in the past couple weeks since it's right next door to where I live, and it has been closed since around Christmas.  

A sign is on both of the doors stating the restaurant is \"Closed for Vacation\", but after 3 visits trying to get a hotdog, I believe the location may be closed.  I tried calling the phone number today and it has been disconnected.

It's a shame.  I like a good hotdog.  I didn't want to give the place no stars because hopefully the owners are just on a really LONG vacation.  Hopefully everything is ok."}
{"text":"The hotdogs are okay, the grilling gives them a more unique flavor than regular hotdogs. However, they are thin and get swallowed up by the bun. If you are a real fan of chilli cheese fries, don't ever order those here. I can only describe this as an abomination. I am willing to bet that they get their chilli out of a can and use liquid processed cheese out of a bigger can. I can tell you that these are the worst chilli cheese fries I've ever had in my life, BAR NONE!!! The service was excellent; courteous, attentive and respectful. The price was good, I got a combo and paid around $8 or so."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Brian's.  Had frankly been kept away by some early reviews of the place but, I found myself with a hot dog hankering this afternoon so, this was as good a time as any to give them a try.

I can only review the one thing I ordered which was the foot long Carolina dog.  They charcoal grill all their dogs/sausages, etc. so they get real points for that.  I was interested in trying the Sahlens dog since I've heard good things about them on Yelp and elsewhere.  Frankly, I was not that impressed.  It's a natural casing dog with a really nice snap to it but in terms of flavor, I found it to be on the bland side, even with the charcoal grilling.  Nowhere near the garlicky goodness of another NY favorite, Sabretts.  

The Carolina dog comes with mustard, chili, slaw and onions.  Beyond the dog itself, the chili was not bad and the slaw had a good vinegary bite to it.  Price wise, it was $4.32 for a foot long which is basically two dogs in one so, I was not taken aback by the price like some other reviewers.  I could see things adding up quickly though if you add fries and a drink.  Think I saw on the menu that making it a combo added another $3.50 to the price.

Overall, I would come back if the dog jones were to bite me hard again but, don't think I'll have Brian's on my quick bite regulars list."}
{"text":"3 stars?  Really?  

This is a hot dog joint. Don't expect anything gourmet.  Don't try to take your dinner home. It's just a good meal.

I love the dogs. Some people think that a Ball Park Frank is decent. If that's your case, don't come here. You'll be upset about spending a bit on just a hot dog. 

If, on the other hand, you appreciate awesome dogs, then stop by!

Must say, I love the spicy fries too. I've never ventured beyond a dog and fries (why would you?) but given their high level of quality, I'm sure everything else is great. 

Favorite part about the meal....  Walking in and smelling the wood burning. Very nice!"}
