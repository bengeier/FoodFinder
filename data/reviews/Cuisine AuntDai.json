{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????

?????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Très bons plats, portions vraiment généreuses et prix raisonnables!!! J'y suis allée à plusieurs reprises, toujours un bon service. Que peut-on demander de plus!?"}
{"text":"I thought this place was fantastic. It totally reminded me of Chez Chilli in Chinatown, but without the crazy traffic (relatively speaking). My big test is always in the Szechuan cabbage, the most humble dish ever, but incredibly good when done right. And they delivered. The cumin beef was excellent too."}
{"text":"Three and half stars. Some Chinese dishes are tasty but some of them are not that good. So it should be careful when ordering the dishes."}
{"text":"Very overhyped and over priced. Yeah it's Chinese food but it's overpriced, bland and oily. Rather go the extra distance to China town and get some good Chinese food"}
{"text":"Best Chinese Restaurant hands down. And is also next to my apartment! I always drop by for some delicious noodles. Their beef and chicken is good and well-marinated. The orange beef is a specialty plate that I like at this restaurant. 
Fast service and good pricing."}
{"text":"Ended up here somewhat randomly when we were stranded in the neighborhood because of a cancelled flight, and it turned out to be exactly what we needed to make a difficult evening into a delightful one. The food has a homemade taste to it that's missing from many of the Chinese restaurants we've tried. The server let us switch the tv from the NBA finals to the World Cup, and then recommended a spicy shrimp dish that was off the hook. The wonton soup was also really good. Service was quick and the server was super-friendly. University of Montreal students, you are lucky to have a place like this!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese restaurant, the dishes are genuine and the price is reasonable. It's a mix of Sichuan and Northeast style. Chicken and mushroom is a very good Northeastern cuisine to try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"Vraiment bon et authentique! C'est mon restaurant préféré dans le quartier. Certains plats sont un peu trop piquants pour ce qui ne sont pas habitués, faut faire attention."}
{"text":"Not a fancy look but that's not what matters here. The service was really friendly French and English. The quality and flavour were awesome. The food didn't take to long and it wasn't to quick to be out of a box so you get the feel a lot is homemade and traditional. Lots of variety. I'm a Asian food lover and I will most definitely return here for another great meal."}
{"text":"I will be honest; they are one of the better Chinese restaurants in Montreal but that is not necessarily because they are very good, it is because Montreal is horribly lacking when it comes to Chinese cuisine. If you are a meat lover they do have good variety and some of the food is good, but when it comes to appetizers or anything to do with vegetables, they are really not good (and options are very limited). To give an example, my di san xian came with almost no garlic inside and potatoes that were hard and tasteless. It was not bad but it was not good either. 

If you are in Montreal and craving Chinese food, it is a good place to go; price to portion ratio is very good too. But is it good Chinese food in general? I think that's debatable. Ambience is modest and neat, which is something I appreciate a lot. The staff is lovely too, polite and super attentive--to the point that I feel guilty writing this review. I really, really wanted to love them as Montreal dearly needs a superb Chinese restaurant..."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately, we weren't fans... (PS: I am Chinese Canadian, third generation, but by no means do I consider myself a connoisseur of Chinese cooking. This is just based on experience/food/my preference).

The place was small, but we were able to get a table for four right away. Looking through the menu, the choices looked familiar and yummy. We ordered the chow mein cantonese, the singapore noodles, a seafood & tofu pot dish, the eggplant dish with some rice, and a pork ribs dish. I never thought I would make a comment about water, but it definitely attributed to my experience... Firstly, it was warm, not just lukewarm...which was odd. Also, there was something \"off\" with the taste, just couldn't figure it out, but then my 8 year old sister whispered in my ear \"it tastes like old towels\"... I saw that they put lemons in their jugs of water, but it definitely had an off putting taste.

Onto the food: also though the dishes seemed familiar, taste-wise they were not. The eggplant dish was definitely a favourite! I've had a similar eggplant dish at other Chinese restaurants, but they sometimes overdo it with the fish sauce. This dish was very yummy! My family said the ribs were good, my little sister's favourite. The chow mein noodles were just ok (I think it's because I'm used to the thinner, yellow noodles with a mixture of super crispy/less crispy noodles), the seafood & tofu dish was okay too. The singapore noodles were a miss though... we are used to it having more of a curry taste, but this dish tasted too much of sesame oil. 

It wasn't horrible, but combining the icky feeling of the water with the dishes being just okay...I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Came with a friend last Sunday. The house was packed and waitress recommended Ma Po Tofu which is so delicious, spicy and tender even it may not match well with red wine.
the service was really A1."}
{"text":"Très bon. J'ai pris un plat avec des calmars. Il y en avait bcp!!! Pas seulement 3-4 calmars qui se battent dans l'assiette. Plat savoureux, copieux. Un peu pimenté, mais ça passait.
Un petit bémol, il faisait soit chaud, soit froid. Le déco est OK, sans prétention. À essayer!"}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly- Good food!

Braised pork belly was amazingly tasty - (Hóng Sh?o Ròu Dùn F?n Tiáo)

Orange beef was moist on inside and nice and crunchy on outside.

We were 3 and ended up ordering for 6 - plate after plate.

The chicken in dry wok was seriously flavourful - (Gàn gu? j?)

A great restaurant - to bad we can't keep it our little secret..."}
{"text":"The best authentic Chinese food that i have tried in Montreal! Great staff and homie environment. The restaurant is located on a main Street that's 2blocks away from metro station and plenty of parking right in front of the door. As of the food itself, it is definitely 5 star!"}
{"text":"First time at Aunt Dai and we are fans! We had the hot and sour soup for entrée which was very good! For main course we had squid in oyster sauce, it was excellent. Spicy shrimps were very good as well. We did not really enjoy the dry wok chicken but that was just a bad choice from our part. The description was pretty clear.
Anyway the food at Aunt Dai is very authentic! Best we had in Montreal so far! We will surely eat there again!

Ps: They should not make available the online reservation because it doesnt matter whether you reserve or not, you will have to wait anyway."}
{"text":"It remains the No.1 Chinese cuisine in montreal. I don't mean they make the food how delicate or fine, I just wanna say in terms of ambiance, price, service and taste, Aunt Dai totally meets my expectation. And every time I could walk out from the resto with a satisfied belly!"}
{"text":"i would not say it is the best Chinese restaurant in MTL, but if you want to feel something real, I will still recommend this place. Tried D?ng B?i Dà L? Pí , Su?n Là T Dou S? and Hóng Sh?o Ròu Dùn F?n Tiáo (totally not the typical Chinese order) all taste delicious. I definitely will visit there again !"}
{"text":"So good! auth chinese food! but the portion is abit small."}
{"text":"Actual visits on 9/4/14 & 9/5/14.  UDON Noodles with Chicken and Veggies.  I absolutely will be a repeat customer here.  I saw the Aunt Dai awning while stopped in traffic. The yellow awning caught my eye and I was curious about the \"grandma\" type figure on the sign as well. It's not a large place and if it's crowded it can take some time to get your food. It was a close call to get in/out during an hour lunch break.  In any event, the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Greater Montreal. Delicious food + consistency + great service. The winning combination that keeps me coming back. I've been to all of their locations over the years and they have never disappointed me. My favourite dishes: Cabbage stir-fry, Lamb hot pot, twice cooked pork. Tried the new Sichuan Pepper Chicken Salad for the first time yesterday. I now have a new must-order dish. Already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"This place was GREAT in every aspect.  The server was very friendly when we arrived.  She saw that we brought our own wines - she gave us an extra table to chill them (we didn't even have to ask).

The food was authentic (I am from China).  I picked the sweet and spicy beef and it was the real deal. The pork dumplings are to DIE for.  If you are to die,  you will die happy. 

The prices are really reasonable for the excellent food.

They have a motto outside of the restaurant - 'Never stop improving' - I say 'Keep up the good work!'

Will be back."}
{"text":"I expected more than that. Too greasy and spicy and it is not as good as before. In addition, every time when the door opens, cold wind blows."}
{"text":"Aunt dai has great customer service to go along with their amazing food.

They're twice cooked pork is my favorite.

New location is bigger, than their old one. 

Good place for take out or to eat in."}
{"text":"The reservation was respected, and the food was consistently yummy and an excellent value! The veggies were fresh (not overcooked) and everything was flavourful. I especially loved the eggplant, green beans, and chicken dishes. Won ton soup was better than the beef mushroom, in my opinion, and I'll pass next time on the fried ice cream. Awesome that it's BYOB! It seems like a homey, family run place. It was clean with polite service. One of my family members has been there 3 times this week, he loves it so much. I'll probably become a regular! Yup, one if the best Chinese restos in the city, keep it up AuntDai!"}
{"text":"J'ai mangé au Aunt Dai en novembre 2017 un samedi après-midi et j'ai adoré. Étant d'origine Chinoise et ayant mangé dans plusieurs restos Chinois à Montréal, je vous recommande ce resto. 

Nous avons pu goûter à 11 plats : soupe wonton au porc, boeuf au cumin, choux sautés, crevettes épicées, porc braisé avec nouilles de patates douces, poulet Kung Pao, chow mein aux crevettes et légumes, dumplings au porc, haricots verts sautés, poulet Général Tao et finalement, du boeuf épicé ! 

Ce fût un excellent repas chinois remplis de plats plus traditionnels et de plats pas traditionnels du tout. Mes coups de coeurs fût : les crevettes épicées, le flanc de porc braisé avec nouilles de patates douces, le poulet Général Tao et le boeuf épicé. Je recommande fortement ce resto aux amateurs de cuisine asiatique, que ce soit ceux espérant retrouver des plats plus typiques et traditionnels ou ceux qui aiment les plats plus \"Nord-Américanisés\". Quoi qu'il en soit, il y en pour tous les goûts ! De plus, Aunt Dai a une salle privée qui peut accommoder environ 60 personnes, pour tous types d'événements !

Pour ma critique complète et plus de photos, allez voir mon blogue: Turquoise Blog (lien dans ma bio !)"}
{"text":"Excellents plats chinois. Mon favori est le boeuf au brocoli. Mon chum trouve qu'il me donne la pire haleine du yable, mais fort heureusement il en mange avec appétit lui aussi!"}
{"text":"Food is good but NO SERVICE at all.  These people hire 1 waiter at the busiest Sunday dinner hours.  We waited 40 minutes until get serviced"}
{"text":"Mao Po Tofu is a must. It changed my entire perception of Tofu. I generally don't order tofu because I find its taste bland but AuntDai's Mao Po Tofu was full of flavour and spices. It was truly delightful, a sure heart winner.

Also took cumin beef which was great but the onions are really burned (Bozan X said he loved it but I would prefer just a little less burnt). Regardless, I still think the beef was amazing and tender, came in small strips skewed into thin bamboo sticks.

We also had Kung pao chicken (because waitress suggested) and sweet and spicy eggplant. I've had better eggplant elsewhere (see my review for Niu Kee). But the Kung Pao was different from your average Chinese restaurant meal and was even spicy! 
 
Ambience is quiet and nice and better than Chinatown restaurants. Loved this place, going to come soon for the Tofu!!"}
{"text":"If you know how to order authentic Chinese or even if you don't ( you just order whatever does look or sound familiar. Even if you don't do that, they still have a general Tao chicken that puts all others to shame. The rest, pork belly, spicy green beans, twice cooked pork. Everything is just perfect."}
{"text":"The caveat for this review is it was a takeout. I typically give more leeway for takeout because I find, things are not always equal. Picked up a bunch of food on Chinese New Year's Eve. I will also add that I've been to their previous location many times on Cote-des-Neiges and loved it every time. This time I was a little disappointed, so maybe I would have been better off eating there. I ordered the pork belly with sweet potato noodles. Good but flavour neutral, which was never the case for this dish. The green beans were as good as always, general tao (for my daughter) a little less perfect. The satay beef was good, not great and same with the beef udon. I give them 4 stars not 5 because of my past experiences but hopefully next time will get back to their usual 5 star, food standards."}
{"text":"After being frustrated with the bland and repetitive offerings found at most Chinese restaurants and Chinese restaurants with separate menus for Canadians, Auntdais offers something different. Whatever we have ordered so far at our times there has been flavourful and prepared well. The price point is not bad either as most dishes can be shared. Im not too fond of the lunch menu though."}
{"text":"Just amazing! Authentic flavours with a Canadian flair. Fresh and super tasty! One of the best Chinese restaurants I've tried and I've tried dozens of authentic ones. Great price!"}
{"text":"My favorite Asian place was closed and was in need of a backup I went to this place based on the review I saw... well what a deception  asked if they could make a tofu general Tao they were nice enough to make it but there was barely any sauce and the tofu was bad . Ordered Kung pow chicken and imperial rolls and it was just disgusting. The chicken tasted like frostbite and was over boiled instead of cooked it was super hard and the color was nearly white even with all the sauce definitely not stir fried the whole plate tasted terrible and the imperial rolls were kind of bad too 

All I can say is that all of you guys who gave 5 star I will let you know  on my little gem of Chinese restaurant and you will never set foot on that terrible place again .. 

Conclusion worst food I ate in a restaurant in the last decade by far would give minus 5 star"}
{"text":"In a city with a gazillion Chinese restaurants, coming across a good one is often hit or miss. But sometimes you need that pan-fried, greasy, MSG fix. So being that it was just a quick walk from our crib, we decided to finally visit Aunt Dai. 

On arrival we discover that the place is packed. Popularity, a good sign. Luckily there was one table for two left and we were seated right away. The decor is pretty plain, which probably isn't why people come here anyways. As we sat and checked out the menu, steaming plates kept passing by, the aroma of stir fry and soup torturing our taste buds (in a good way). By the time our server was ready to take our order, we were starving. 

We ordered the Twice Fried Pork, the Dry Fried Green Beans, and a Shrimp Fried Rice. When we asked for the pork, the server was like, \"you know it's spicy right? And it also has bacon in it.\" To which my partner and I looked at one another like, \"PERFECT!\" (I mean come on who doesn't like spicy or fatty?)

I was expecting the pork to be flaming hot but it was actually had the right amount of kick, enough to get a little sweat but not too much where it's painful. After a few bites I was actually addicted. The string beans were similarly flavorful, a pepper and black bean sauce explosion. The fried rice was solid, but had a good amount of vegetables, which was a good balance to all the grease and salt. 

Overall it was a great food experience. Can't wait to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese takeaway
 Friendly staff and tasty food

Unlike every Chinese takeaway ever, the meat was good quality and fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants because of the more, rather, authentic type of Chinese foods offered (as well as accommodating the North American general tao), and their service has been great for the times that I've came here. I've had the Mapo Tofu and the Kung Pao Chicken, and they both bring back nostalgia. Will definitely decide to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! Quel ajout formidable au quartier!!! Vraiment un excellent et authentique restaurant chinois. Nous avions entendu parler de la succursale de CDN en bien et nous n'avons vraiment pas été déçus par celle d'Anjou! Avons commandé le poulet Kung pao (5/5), le porc cuit deux fois (4/5) et des plats de légumes (aubergines et pommes de terres, ainsi que choux sauté, les deux plats 5/5 et absolument délicieux!). Service rapide et attentionné, livraison disponible jusqu'à 20h...à essayer au plus vite!!!! Nous allons y retourner souvent en tout cas!!!"}
{"text":"In Montreal, this is our favourite Chinese restaurant. For vegetarians like us, this place provides a variety of ultra tasty meals. You can request the meat to be removed from many of the dishes (yay! More options for us!). Try their cabbage (best I've ever tried), eggplants and mapo tofu. Their dishes are sooooo flavourful and well-balanced that it's hard not to come back on the next day! Fair enough, I'm a fan of Chinese food, but this restaurant is truly making me dream about their food (only Chinese food lovers will understand - how can we live without this explosion of flavours? - you get the point)."}
{"text":"I'll make an exception to my avoiding Chinese restaurants in Montreal and come back to Aunt Dai any day.

All three dishes we ordered exceeded expectations. The Ma Po Tofu was excellent: spicy with the right amount of numbness (ma). On the salty side but it didn't take away from the taste at all. It's the first Ma Po Tofu I had in Montreal that I'd call authentic. My second favorite dish was braised porc with sweet potato noodles. The porc was melt-in-your-mouth tender in a delicious stew. I enjoyed cumin beef as well - the meat was very tender however lacked a bit of cumin to my taste and I found the over-sautéd onion skins ordinary.

The restaurant also has a very informative website with pinyin and YouTube videos of a few dishes and how to pronounce their Chinese names. If it doesn't add to the credibility of the food, at least it's good effort to educate locals on \"real\" Chinese food. They just made it really easy for the uninitiated to try something other than General Tao. Please do.

Similar to other more legit Chinese places, the price range is a bit above what would entice me to come back every day and the portions are satisfying but not huge, hence a 4-star rating. It's also BYOB - awesome. CDN represent!"}
{"text":"This review was based on what I ordered today: general tao, pork dumplings and tofu salad. The flavors were bland. Nothing on the plates was memorable or make me want to eat it again. Very disappointed. Maybe other dishes are better, but I would never know because I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Très bon. Portion raisonnables. Service rapide."}
{"text":"????????????????????????.?????????????????...????????...
????...?????????????...???.??????????????."}
{"text":"Really good food! I went twice in two days because we had to spend the night at a nearby hospital (nothing too serious). Peanut shrimp was really good. The spicy chicken was really good too, and was packed with flavour. I eat spicy Indian food all the time, but the chicken was way spicier--too much for me. I mean, I found about ten Thai chillies in my plate! The red curry was good but not as flavourful. I'll most likely will go again. Very good service. Pleasant staff. I'd give five stars if we could select be spice level."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit and everything was just as great as the first !! Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Amazing portions and just an overall authentic experience. We ordered the pork with pickled vegetables and the three cup chicken. Both were plenty for two people. With leftovers. Portions we're great. Flavour was amazing"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this place based on all the positive reviews but unfortunately I was disappointed with my experience. I ordered the shrimp with black Szechuan spices from their lunch menu. The meal, although made to order, did not taste fresh. The shrimp was dry and overcooked (probably precooked) and the veggies tasted stale. I also felt like there was definitely way too much sauce. Shrimp and veggies were drowning in the sauce, which was extremely sweet and overpowering. All in all, it was a very generic \"chinese\" meal reminding me more of food court (Tiki Ming) asian food. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but the way I see it is if it can't be done right, then it shouldn't be on the menu. Will def not be going back anytime soon..."}
{"text":"The best Chinese food I've ever had!  Delicate flavors, not too oily or heavy.  I highly recommend checking out this new little family-run place."}
{"text":"I ordered three cup chicken? it was not cooked properly?the chicken are still raw? They said it was meant to be render? I can not agree?I am a Chinese who have eaten traditional chicken cusine for many times, it is definitely not cooked enough. I like this place before, right now I doubt their cooking skill, will not go again."}
{"text":"This restaurant worthes a WOW (and there is not so many chinese restaurants in Mtl worth that)! It serves real authentic Chinese plats such as Porc enrobé de farine de riz cuit à la vapeur(???)--the best I had in Mtl, which are as delicious as their \"American Chinese\" plats such as the classic General Tao chicken.

The owner is so nice and staff is very helpful. They said that as the opposite of most of chinese restaurants, they will focus not only on the cuisine, but also on the service. I asked for a take out, and everything was so well packed to keep their original flavour.

And finally a great BYOW restaurant in CDN! Bravo! Keep going on!"}
{"text":"My most trusted Chinese food Yelp experts sang AuntDai's praises, and they were not wrong. This BYO, Northern Chinese, lovely mellow restaurant on Côte des Neiges is an actual heaven of spicy homemade comfort food. I went with a beloved vegetarian, and I want to share everything when I go to a restaurant like this, so I ate veg as well and it was truly no joke delicious. Now of course I desperately want to go back for the twice cooked pork and mapo tofu, but vegetarians can eat well here too and that's a gift. 

We had the homemade udon noodles (which originate in China apparently) in a pepper sauce with veggies; tofu in a light spicy sauce made from mustard greens; and spicy, salty Szechuan pepper green beans. Perfect combo, and delicious cold the next day as well. 

When I messaged my Yelp buds about whether they thought we could eat veg here they all said Yes, just ask the staff for recommendations when you get there. I love this because it means they know and love and trust the folks here, and again they were right. Despite being overwhelmed with a full restaurant when they were expecting no one, on a rainy day where everyone seemed to get hungry for Northern Chinese food all at once, the single server hustled with grace around the room and the chef came out and helped her serve, and their recommendations were friendly and perfect. 

I wish there was no TV here, and I wish the takeout containers were recyclable, but I can't even dock a star for it because it was so good and I'm already planning to go back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice already and plan to return. The last time was on a cold winter night, amidst fresh snow, and to our surprise found the restaurant bustling with diners. Many Asian faces... a sign that we were in the right place for authentic Chinese food.

Service was fast; our lone server literally ran from table to table, taking orders, serving and clearing, without losing his cheer.  

Food was amazingly great.  We started with the double-cooked pork (Hui Guo Rou). When the meat was gone we drizzled its gravy over our steamed rice. That was how good! Another memorable dish was the dry pot chicken (Gan Guo Ji). We would have doggy-bagged the gravy too if we could! 

For dessert, the fried bananas topped the evening."}
{"text":"This is based on the one dish I had for lunch today. It was spicy flavourful and authentic.

One star off for the decor...Aunt Dai decided to keep the existing tables and chairs that make the place look dark and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant for Mother's Day, service was great. Started with a won ton soup and sweet and sour- both were delicious!! Then came the salt and pepper shrimp by far the best dish for me! Then we had the satay beef which was tender and so yummy!! Then we had the three cup chicken, was a real crowd pleaser. The service was amazing. For Mother's Day, they brought a free glass of wine. Good music,
Good vibes
Will for sure  be coming back

I would like the recipe for the salt and pepper shrimp! It was finger licking good!!!"}
{"text":"Third time visit and I am in love. Hey, can we add a 6 stars here? 

 I came in on a cold November evening, I was greeted with a warm cup of water to my table. Then, I ordered a seafood pad thai. One taste of it and I was in heaven! The noodles were mix with something sweet, I can't put my finger on it but it was delicious. I finished my plate in less than 10 minutes. I am a fast eater. The better the food taste, the faster I want it in my mouth. 

At the end of my visit, I have a -15$ on my debit card and a happy belly. Next visit will be soon..."}
{"text":"First off... Ditto for the decor. They could make the place a little more welcoming. 

On to the food, it was great. Same quality of food as the one in Côtes-des-neiges. By the way, I met the owner, he remembers me. I spoke to him in Mandarin for the first time as well! We took the braised pork with potato noodles. It is one of the popular dishes in the restaurant and our favourite. We also ordered the eggplants, red and yellow peppers with a tofu kind (or vegetable, sorry! I can't remember the name of the veggie). 

Near the closing time, we had a chat about the history of China with the owner of the AuntDai restaurants. 

Overall, if you can ignore the decor, everything is amazingly good. The owner really makes this place as authentic as possible. Apparently, 6 of the dishes are from North of China. You don't need to go to China to have a taste of authentic cuisine. Get them right there!"}
{"text":"Another hidden gem in the côte-des-neiges area, good and quick service, food quality is superior, price range is not expensive, this place is BYOB and they do take credit cards. Will definitely come back!

One thing to have in mind is the space, it's rather small so you may want to make a reservation before showing up. We went on a Friday evening at 7:15 pm without reservation and we're lucky enough to find a table for two, within 10 minutes the place was packed!"}
{"text":"There are two AuntDai restaurants and this one is located near downtown Montreal. The restaurant is on the 2nd floor of a two-story building. The first floor is a Lebanese restaurant. The food served here is mostly Taiwanese cuisine.  During our visit the restaurant was full of patrons and it was a good indicator that all of them were Asians. It speaks volume on the authenticity of the food.  We ordered Ma Po Tofu With Ground Pork, Braised Pork Belly, and Sauteed String Beans.  All of the dishes were tasty and we will return to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"We loved AuntDai  when it was in Cotes Des Neiges and was ecstatic when it opened in down town area . We however were worried that maybe the food would not be as good. We were so pleasantly surprised when we found the food is even better. This is in my opinion the best Chinese food in Montreal and serves some of the best Shrimp dishes of any Asian restaurant.Dry wok shrimp and their spicy shrimp are phenomenal . We also like their eggplant , the spicy diced chicken, kung pao chicken, beef with hot pepper and their Cantonese noodles that unlike some other Chinese restaurants are not soaked in too much sauce. I think AuntDai has now officially completed the down town foodie leg of Asian food .
You want Japanese go to Kazu
You want Korean go to Ganadara
For Chinese ;O Yea... AuntDai it is."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in town, and certainly one of the better options in CDN. They do serve general tao crap if that's what you're after, but you should try their other items on the menu because they have some really authentic Sichuan dishes (many of which are quite spicy). Service is quick and efficient, and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"If I had reviewed last time I was here I would give five stars. But this time I feel like they have changed their chef. One of the northeast salad was served warm which was definitely wrong. Some other dishes tasted not the same. Not only me but also my other friends tasted the difference. 
So now I can't recommend the dishes. But before I liked the lamb pot and the  flower fish. 
I will lower my expectations if I would go there again."}
{"text":"This place was a nice little surprise. (I would take a star off for decor though because even as a \"hole in the wall\" it's still very unwelcoming as ambience. You know how mom&pop's places or your typical joints would still have that \"charm\", this place is just flat out dark and cold lol! Literally. Everytime someone walks in, we would freeze our butts off all over again)

Now that I got that out of the way, let's talk about the food :D Like I said, it was a nice little surprise. I myself am not a fan of Chinese food and neither are 2 other of the 3 friends that were there with me... weird, yes but I heard good things so we went for a little discovery :)

Our favorite dish was the braised pork belly with sweet potato noodles. We also took the spicy peanut chicken, spicy pork sauté with mushrooms and a beef sauté. Everything tasted good. Some more spicy than others but nothing we couldn't handle. I think we'll come back to try out other stuff next time but it'll be take-out"}
{"text":"Excellent food, nice ambiance and friendly staff. Loved the octopus and also udon noodles and beef. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The mapo tofu is probably the best I've had in town. Highly recommend it. 

The spicy fish filet is also amazing. 

If you can take the heat, you can't go wrong with Aunt Dai."}
{"text":"Outside of china town this is a very good option, it has all the classics on the menu along with a few dishes I had not had before.  Service was fast, and food was very good.  Definitely worth stopping in again the next time i'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered a shrimp dish but it tasted not fresh. We asked the waitress and she went to the kitchen and said the shrimp should be fresh. We said we need to talk to the chef, and the chef came and tasted it as we requested. Finally he made us another dish and the new one tasted much better. After all, it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"the dishes there are too greasy for me. not as good as when it was in the côte-des-neiges area"}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. 

My girlfriend and her friends discovered this place. Then she brought me to this place. My dad told me this place opened over few years and it's a little bit popular around Côte-Des-Neiges corner. 

I tried their Stewed chicken with mushrooms and Fried Aubergines. Really nice. But I know their one of the best dish is a fish dish which I haven't try it yet. 

They give to you a small bowl of rice but you can refill it unlimited time. Just ask to the waitress. The place is not too big. So at lunch or dinner time, you will wait. 

For me, I believe this Chinese Restaurant is the best. At least better than others on the street Côte-Des-Neiges. I grow up in this corner, so I tried pretty much all of the Chinese restos. 

Great place. Just don't like to wait in the line ..."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant because it made a reputation for its name for their quality food, also because of the shocking news of their original site at Cote des neiges burned down to ashes. When I finally get to try this place out, I was actually super disappointed because the food was way too oily! We took stirred fried cabbage and sizzling wok of lamb, but I was hesitant to take a bite when I saw that the dishes are excessively oily, and the seasoning was also quite heavy too. I would not recommend this restaurant, especially for people who want to eat healthily."}
{"text":"My 10th or something time coming back to this restaurant and after another few years trying other Chinese restaurants in town I came with my verdict: yep, AuntDai is number one Chinese restaurant in my books. I still consider their mapo tofu the best and their pork belly with glass noodles is just a perfect creation. Everytime, yes, everytime I've came to this place I walk away with a full belly and a smile on my face. This place may is not fancy, but it serves real and authentic dishes from China."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant in Montreal, truly the best mapo tofu you can get here. They recently changed location and moved closer to Guy Concordia, which is not my favorite area to go out, but for this restaurant I'm willing to take buses and metros if I have to. Their pork belly with sweet potato noodles is my favorite dish, the mixture of spices and flavors makes this is almost a work of art. And no, I'm not exaggerating here, it's an amazing place to eat out if you're looking for authentic Chinese flavors. Hands down, it should be on the list of top Chinese restaurants in Montreal."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Was just there this evening. The Singapore noodles were outstanding as well as the crispy shrimp. The other the dish was a very spicy stew-like dish and was delicious. The staff were very warm and friendly. The place is quite small and very busy so I would suggest making a reservation especially if you go there on the weekend. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. It was that good."}
{"text":"great service better food. the three cup chicken and the lamb stew are legendary. The server are super friendly and the price is competitive, you can't go wrong here for Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"First time at aunt's dai and will definitely return, the food is delicious, very different from other chinese restaurants who serves greasy salty food. The spocy chicken are pieces of deep fried chicken with chili and as the name suggests very spicy indeed but incredibly good, the three cup chicken is savoury, the sweet and spicy squid is so good there is not enough on the plate and to top it of the fried ice cream yum. An excellent experience, the place is packed, one small critic though they need to add more staff, with only 2 waitresses working and full tables around, service is rather slow, understandable but could be improved."}
{"text":"Authentic chinese!!!! Confirmed by chinese lol. Braised pork with sweet potato noodle is my favorite. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"THE FLAVORS HERE ARE ON POINT 

We took the braised pork and the dried pot chicken and they were both fantastic. The pork was very tender, and spiced perfectly. Although we also liked the dried pot chicken, it was a bit too salty for our liking. We really recommend the braised pork though! The prices were also pretty affordable and the server (I believe she was aunty dai herself) was lovely. I hear the sichuan pot is also pretty good so I would definitely come here again to try it out!"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a nice restaurant with very big tables since it could be used for hotpot (which I personally really like especially for Chinese restaurants). The decor is kind of rustic but homey which is nice as well.

FOOD: The food is pretty good! The quality is great as well, especially for a Chinese restaurant. Although some dishes were a bit too salty, the taste was still up there. I got their grilled squid (ok), pad thai (disappointing), broccoli and beef (good), tripe (good) and tofu and seafood pot (good). 

PRICE: Prices are a tad bit expensive in my opinion, especially seeing how it is in a student-friendly area. But I guess for the quality, it's acceptable.

SERVICE: The service was better than most Chinese restaurants. The waitress was friendly and the owners of the restaurants were very welcoming as well."}
{"text":"Best chinese restaurant in Quebec (sorry Chez Chili) in terms of food. 

Ho Lee Fook (holy f*ck in chinese) the food. Most amazing chinese food I've had in North America (ok I haven't been to many places outside Montreal, but still). 

Mapo Tofu: Good mix of spicy and tangy. Very flavorful 5/5. The waitress didn't think we'd survive the spiciness but having dated a Sichuan girl for 3 years, I did ok. You can ask for less spicy. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's sichuan legit (as the colours and taste were kinda off), but it was fooking GUD.

Braised Pork + Sweet potato noodles: Meat mainly consisted of fat (from under the skin of the animal). The fat and muscles were very tender and tasty, but lacked a bit in flavor. More spices could have been added in the stew that cooked the meat, but it's still worth a good 4.5/5.

Cumin Beef: Cooked well done but very tender and flavorful. The taste of cumin wasn't as strong as most cumin meat dishes I've had. The onions look like they've been stir fried for a long time, for they were kinda burnt and dried out (almost like chips). This intensified the flavor of the onion.

The decor was pretty simple, the entrance not eye catching, and the service average, but some items on the menu are definitely worth braving the winter for.

Seeing a lot of non-chinese folks ordering General Tso, singapore noodles, chow mein really hurt me deep inside. Give a chance to authentic chinese cuisine by ordering items that don't sound familiar (or just ask the server), they're just so much more tasty than, say, mu shu pork and orange beef. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese restaurant. This restaurant used to be located at Cote Des Neiges and had a strong reputation. 

Having been to this location twice. I can still vouch for the mapo tofu 5/5 (possibly the best in MTL), the braised pork and glass noodles 4.5/5, the three cup chicken 4.5/5, the spicy fish fillet 4.5/5,and the poached fish in chili oil 4/5. 

They also have a vegetarian menu that has some very tasty dishes!!

The bowl of rice is also bottomless, so you can get a lot of rice if you can't handle the heat of some dishes!!

Service is also on point!!"}
{"text":"Another great find in Montreal for a Chinese restaurant. Finally with more chinese people coming so is the authentic food. unlike that fake Cantonese food which has been here way to long and time to go....
Sichuan Lajigi chicken was great.  Basha fish in sichuan peppercorn soup so f--ken awesome. Only the dumpling were just OK. Better than most but not to china par...service excellent and I will be back probably sunday with a gang of friends who love chinese food."}
{"text":"malheureusement l'édifice à prit feu et le restaurant est fermé. J'espère que cette fermeture n'est pas définitive"}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I brought my family over the weekend and they all really love the authentic northern chinese cuisine. We ordered the 3 cup chicken, twice cooked pork, braised pork, lamb hotpot and a few other.  The service was very good for a chinese restaurant and it;s BYOB!"}
