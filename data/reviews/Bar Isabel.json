{"text":"I don't know who is eating here for $31-60, but the food is well and truly phenomenal and worth every penny.  The service is great, the cocktails are delicious, and the food - whoa.  The bream ceviche was mindblasting, and the octopus was out of this world awesome.  Really, really, really good.  I only went the one time so I'm not telling you you need to get those things, but you certainly won't be disappointed if you do.  Ambiance was okay - a predilection to play music a tad too loud like many restos catering to the young professional sensibility, which I don't get, but it seems the trendy thing to do.  Attracts annoying overpaid hipster patrons as well - the table next to us was a clamorous sea of forgettable vapid single women in their 30s that would repeatedly rupture into a crescendo of squeals: \"this song is about me!\" or \"I know the chef, ladies I know the chef - WHY ISN'T ANYBODY LISTENING TO ME?\" or \"Tamara is a super betch\" or new girl sits down at table, prompting sounds that could etch glass, despite it being said Tamara.  Etcetera.  If it wasn't for our neighbours, the entire experience would have been ethereally sublime.  We had the table closest to the door, it was winter, and it was crazy cold sitting there.  Don't sit there.  Still, despite being a complainer and loving all things complainy: 5 stars, hands down one of the more memorable culinary experiences I've had in the city.  Don't miss it, and book way in advance."}
{"text":"We've visited The Black Hoof (one of the few restaurants Gordon Ramsay visited when he was in Toronto) numerous times and attended various culinary events with Grant van Gameren, so we were really excited to visit Bar Isabel.  If you have been to The Black Hoof, the menu will look extremely familiar -- don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and good (ex. tongue with broche, horse tartar) but there really isn't much new if you have been to his other restaurants.  The bartender took forever to get my drink made -- he kept looking back to the menu to figure out the ingredients were.  Also, I'm not sure if we just had a new waitress or just not the friendly ones other reviewers have said but our waitress told different tables different list of the night's special.  For example, when we asked about what fish they were using for the ceviche, she told us that they were only serving sea bream -- then told the other table that they had the option between sea bream or red snapper.    For every table she went to, she'd ask if they wanted to order anything else, then if the customers said 'no', she'd roll her eyes as she walked away.  Other wait staff re-filled our water, never her.  Our plates were also taken away before we finished our food.  It is nice that Bar Isabel takes reservations, accepts credit cards, and has more space/seating (unlike The Black Hoof)."}
{"text":"After several fantastic meals just down the street at sister restaurant, Bar Raval, we decided to try out dinner at Bar Isabel. We stopped in on Thursday night and luckily was early enough to be seated without a reservation. The place was picking up and could see it would be a busy night.   Server was very informative and attentive without being too obtrusive. Plates were quickly cleaned up, water and wine topped up, checked in a few times throughout the night.   Now for the food: we ordered the bone marrow, half octopus, jamon croquetas, chorizo rojo, and basque cake for dessert. Favourites were hands down the octopus (grilled, tender and so tasty) and the basque case (pleasant surprise and loved the texture.   Can see why it's considered one of the good eats in the city."}
{"text":"Isabel is a very small but cozy place. Hangout with girlfriends on Friday night. The bar is packed full of people. We tried different Spanish tapas dishes. So authentic so good. I heard the chef used to work at Black Hoof.  We ordered beef tongue sandwich, octopus, bone marrow, ribeye, tuna, and meat plate. More than enough to be shared by four girls. Food is so good. I have to say that I'm impressed by the green chili sauce and the side veggie coming with the meat plate. So tasty.  Service is so good. The waitress cleaned up everything after the dish was finished. She even wiped the table before dessert."}
{"text":"After snagging a last minute reservation for 11pm on a cool Friday night, we were really excited to enjoy a late romantic date for the two of us. Reservations are available online on their website. Although we arrived a little early, there were no seats available (our table was getting cleared when we arrived); so make sure you reserve your table before you go!  Though we wanted to order drinks, we decided not to because we had a couple of energy drinks during our drive to Toronto. We vowed to try some next time! As for the menu, we asked our server for some recommendations which she politely answered.  We decided to order: (1) Cured Meat Plate ($16) + Bread ($5) (2) Grilled Razor Clams ($24) (3) Seared Foie Gras, Morcilla and Apple mostarda ($32) to share.  Shortly after we ordered, our cured meat plate and bread arrived. The meat plate consisted of 4 Spanish meats, which, with extensive research, included (1) Lomo Iberico, (2) Buffalo Slinzega, (3) Jamon Iberico de Bellota, and (4) Hunter's Sausage; however, I'm not sure if my research is 100% right. (Someone correct me if I'm wrong!)  In the middle of the meat plate was pickled vegetables that were AMAZING with the cured meats and bread. Hubby and I both wanted to know how they were made...so that we could have it at home, all the time. With a basket of their house made bread, the cured meat plate is definitely great for sharing with company. Bar Isabel has an extensive list of cured meats that you should definitely try because all the curing is done in-house here! Grab a basket of bread and enjoy.  After clearing our bread and cured meat plate completely :D, next up? The Grilled Razor Clams! Well enjoyed in Spain, these are not your ordinary clams. The clams were seasoned simply, with only a few ingredients so that you could taste the original flavours of the razor clams. The dressing on the razor clams was so good that we dipped our leftover house bread in it, and oh my, it was heavenly! A definite recommend.  The foie gras was the real highlight of the night. We had never had foie gras that soft, delicate, full of flavour, or big before! It was as big as a small piece of regular steak, so for the price we paid, we were definitely satisfied with our portion. What I loved the most about the seared foie gras was that the distinct taste of foie gras wasn't as strong as I expected to be. Eaten together with the morcilla and apple mostarda, a condiment made with candied fruit and syrups with mustard flavours, it was incredibly well balanced and savoury! Pretty much perfect in my books.  Though we're sort of late on trying Bar Isabel, we're very glad we tried! Better late than never, right? Everything we tried at Bar Isabel gave us a WOW factor, which is rare for a restaurant for us! With its kitchen fully open until 2am, it is definitely a great place to grab a few late night bites. With Authentic Spanish cuisine, fresh seafood, and great drinks, it is definitely a must try restaurant in Toronto's Little Italy. If you've tried Bar Isabel already, give Bar Raval a shot!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot that knows how to deliver great food and experience. Maybe considered over priced by some but you can't deny that this place has some of the best food in the city. The servers are very throrough and well managed. They provide you with all the necessary information such as drink and food specials for the night. You can tell they are trained properly. I'm not crazy about this and prefer a bit more of a relaxed approach but if this type of militancy is your thing then Bar Isabel is perfect. We ordered some bread and chacuterie for the table to start which was as good as meat and bread can really be. Followed this up with some fried chicken which I highly recommend. This place is really bustling lately since being feature on an episode of Vice and mentioned by several of the top resteraunters in the city. Therefore, getting a table is not always an easy task and to get a solid reservation for your party may require you to call a week or two in advance."}
{"text":"Great dinner with my girlfriend and some friends. First time there so let waiter bring the fixed menu, at $45 / each it was well worth it. Highly recommend, can't wait to go back and explore rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Everything is good here. A good place for a date or a group of 4 to share tapas plates. I've been to the south of Spain and this place does an interesting, modern take on tapas. I went for my birthday with my boyfriend and we made a reservation a few weeks in advance. We got there at 6 pm, which is when they opened, on a Friday in April and there was already a line outside the door. They have a great selection of cheese and meats. We had the patatas bravas, the grilled mushroom montaditos, and the sweetbreads. For desert, I had the leche frita. Everything was delicious. The cocktails were good. Service was good. No complaints. It was a nice place to celebrate a birthday. I've been to Patria as well, and I found Patria to have more traditional plates. Both are good, but different. I find Bar Isabel has fewer & more focused plates where everything is really tasty. Patria has a larger selection on their menu that has a lot of good plates, but also has some misses. I can see why Bar Isabel has made it on the top of many lists as the best restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"We called in around 7ish to see if they could fit a walk in of 4, and my hopes were not high because we knew this place would be busy, but luckily for us a reservation had cancelled and we could get sat if we got there ASAP. Honestly, from that point on, everything just got better and better  First of all, the service is amazing. Sometimes you forget how nice it is to be given top notch service when you've gone to so many that are average or below that(I don't mean this as in high class service). The service is just GOOD, straight forward, and simple. This isn't a pretentious place whatsoever, but the servers just really know how to make sure you're eating and drinking what you want. So A+ for that!  As for the food, well, my expectations were high, but it turned out better than that. It helps that I was SUPER hungry, but everything just had the right amount of flavours, the portions were fair, and every dish was like a new and tasty experience. My personal favourites (and sorry, but I don't remember the names by heart) was the 1/2 octopus, heirloom tomatoes starter (who knew tomatoes could taste THAT good), and blood sausage. We also got dessert and I'm still thinking about it. The basque cake was perfectly cooked, and the fried dulce de leche ball things... I don't know what those were but WOW I could eat 10 of those and not want to stop.   All in all, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time.   I had high expectations coming to this place, and after a month waiting I can say it was worth the wait.   Had plenty of things on the menu but the items that stood out for me was the sea bream ceviche. Bold flavors, great textures and beautifully plated. The razor clams.... The razor clams. I can't stop thinking about them. Buttery, lemon, juicy, with a hit of spice. And then the steak. That was the richest steak I can say I've ever had. With a side of chimichurri to balance all the fat. But each bite was memorable.   Service and ambience were notch as well. I can't wait for my next visit to try the rest of the menu. So satisfied!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful food, great service and unusual drinks. Casual but fun atmosphere. The carpaccio beef, spicy squid, whole-fish ceviche, bread and olive oil were all fantastic and unusually delicious. My sherry was extraordinary. Difficult to get tables, reservations, etc., but you know that. Worth all the trouble if you love great food and are willing to pay for it."}
{"text":"Overpriced and tiny portions.  Food is pretty good but definitely does not deserve the title of best restaurant of 2014."}
{"text":"Super loud. The servers have bad timing. They frequently interrupted our conversation to ask if we needed anything. The oysters a big shining celebration of mediocrity. On the plus side the male bar tender was proper eye candy."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Food / service / ambience. Everything me and my party tried was unbelievable; and we got almost everything on the menu. I recommend this restaurant for everyone to check out and try."}
{"text":"As if there weren't already so many good restaurants along the Ossington strip, Bar Isabel is another one to add to the list. Four of us ventured here on a Wednesday night and needless to say, the former chef of Black Hoof did not fail to disappoint! (Bonus: they take reservations!)  To begin: Devilled Duck Egg, Salt Cod, Morcilla, Hollandaise (2 pcs) - Who would have thought blood sausage would go so well with eggs? Definitely a hit with all four of us. Highly recommend.   Chips, Boquerones, Piquillo, Jalepeno - We had originally ordered the raw horse but this dish came out instead. Surprisingly, as someone who cannot handle spice very well, this dish was not spicy for me at all - the jalapenos are pickled and go really well with the chips. Original Tongue on Brioche - We had to order this as it is a Black Hoof classic. No regrets as a much milder mustard was used which complemented the meat quite nicely.   Seafood: Octopus, Chorizo & Stewed Peppers - Did you know octopus can be tender? We didn't know octopus could be tender. Until we had this dish. Daily WHOLE fish ceviche - The absolute favourite of the evening! Quite possibly the best ceviche any of us have ever had. The daily fish was the sea bream. Highly recommend.   Meat: Fried Chicken & Sticky Eggplant - As a fried chicken lover, I thought this dish was average. Not as oily as Popeyes but not as juicy as Electric Mud. Stewed Tripe, Chorizo & Egg - Beware, this stew has a bit of a kick. That being said, this dish is hearty and very delicious! Highly recommend. Cured Meats - You can't go wrong with anything they serve on this platter.  Dessert: Basque Cake & Boozy Cream - Not too sweet which makes this a great dessert in my books. The outer edge is crispy while the inside is moist enough to stay together and not fall apart. I would get this again.  Cocktails: A Woman Scorned (I am a bourbon lover and I really enjoyed this drink! Comes with one huge ice cube in the middle), Baraganna (great for tequila lovers), Old Flame (be prepared to see your drink on fire), Corpse Reviver #2 (classic), Negroni (another classic)."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night without a reservation and the place was packed. We took a quick look around and decided put our name in for the bar and gave the hostess our name and number. We then walked down the street and had a glass of wine while we waited. Not even 30 mins later, right about the time I was taking the last sip of my Rosso Toscano, my phone rang and our seats were about to open. Perfecto!   They seated us in the exact two seats I identified I'd like to be at - end of the bar overlooking the cocktail wizardry being spun up.   Olives, Almonds, Potatas Bravas, Wild Mushrooms, Grilled Razor Clams and the Half Cornish Hen were all excellent. Being from New England, we love our clams with all the natural brine and prefer them not to be soaked in a \"cleaning\" solution prior to preparation as they were here - but nonetheless they were excellent. Be sure to get some bread to soak up the buttery sauce.  We were stuffed after all that food and skipped dessert. However, the couple next to us had the Basque Cake & Sherry Cream with Foie Gras and raved about it. Wish we kept some room.  The service was also fantastic - everyone was spot on and very helpful.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Overall; 2 1/2 stars. Overhyped new comer. Friendly enough staff but the overall concept needs to be refined and humbled a bit.   Seating:  Went here as a walk-in earlier last week. I've heard the place was impossible to reserve and the woman I spoke with over the phone had also made that clear to me as well.  Nonetheless, I decided to risk it and walk in. Was seated promptly at around 9:30 upon showing up. It's a fairly decent sized space but the layout of tables is inefficient and probably one of the contributing factors to why they are always full.  Side note- they are open till 2am. Great. Only problem is that they have a reduced menu at 11:30. I find that a dumb concept considering that many of these dishes are for the purpose of bar dining. If you have a huge lineup of reservations, you should probably consider it good for business to keep the whole menu on for a few more hours lest you seem lazy...  Ambience:  Upon entering, I noticed immediately a pungent smell of fermentation throughout the resto which was honestly nauseating.  Maybe it was from the garbage baking outside from a hot summer's day that had  wafted inside. I hope it was just my experience for that.... The space is WAY too dark. At one point, one of the waiters had to bring me a flashlight. That should tell you something...it's too damn dark!  Service:  Overall friendly. You can tell the staff are a bit snooty and know that the resto is hot at the moment. Nonetheless, they were courteous enough and had seamless service  .  Food Quality:  Look, Toronto's rising wages and emerging young professional class has brought about a newfound curiosity in food culture. That being said, Bar Isabel is riding a wave of hype. The food is pretty bland and unexciting. The octopus is bland and there are parts of the menu that are unnecessarily extravagant to ride on some positive review coattails (ie- foie gras for a desert pie). The food is good quality but it's overpriced. Being one of the very few tapas places around, the price point isn't necessarily the best tasting but rather that dishes here are fairly big. If that was the main reason to advertise good reviews fine. Still..best tapas in Toronto? Common' man..."}
{"text":"The grilled octopus tasted fishy and was average in taste. The bone marrow followed with a mediocrity that started to become the theme of the meal. This restaurant is very much over hyped and probably will fade in popularity soon. The grilled asparagus was offered with a luke warm tasteless cheese. The service however was very pleasant and the ambience decent. Overall though- definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good restaurant that I have visited more than once. My most recent experience was less impressive than my previous. The drinks were good, however on the pricey side. The my ex girlfriend was delicious, sweet. The French absinthe was served in a glass with an absinthe fountain for dripped water over a sugar cube on a slotted spoon. I had hoped for the floating sugar cube variation, however, that evening that did not happen. We ordered the bread starter, jamon, quarter octopus, sea breeam and shrimp ceviche with nacho chips, and bone marrow.  The bone marrow was delicious and served with a mint sauce and salt to put on the bone marrow. The ceviche was fresh tasting. The octopus was tasty with a varied and hearty sauce. Unfortunately, the adobo chicken and quail egg that was ordered never arrived, and was missed from the order. The restaurant served a complimentary dessert that was overly salty... Good food, the service could have been better, I expected better from this place considering the stellar reputation and reviews that Torontonians have given it.   3 and a 1/2 *"}
{"text":"I had great night out with my wife at the highly talked about Bar Isabel, which was voted best new restaurant in Canada by En Route magazine!  Lots to live up to, no?  It definitely delivered a tasty meal with a lot of flavours.  The atmosphere in Bar Isabel felt like you were taken away  to a tapas bar in Spain.  It definitely did not feel like you were sitting at a bar at College and Shaw.  The owner Grant Van Gameren was the old chef at the Black Hoof and a few items on the menu were comparable. Here is what we ordered  Marinated Sardine Crostini (2pc) - great starter, I could have eaten them all night (but I didn't) Pan Con Jamon Iberico (2pc) - a necessary flavour if you want a taste of Spain Morcilla, Salt Cured Foie Gras & Brioche - the most creative dish of the night, as the blood sausage tastes way better topped with Foie Gras and salt.  I didn't love the blood sausage, but I LOVED the portion of Foie that topped it. WHOLE Fish Ceviche - probably too much for two people and the perfect amount for three or four people.  I love ceviche and it was really good but Foxley's definitely tops it. It should really come in a small portion for two people. Arbol Chili Chickpeas & Snow Pea Leaves were a great side dish for the ceviche.  I had a great tipsy and tasty experience here, but none of the dishes blew me away.  My favourite restaurants in the city (my favourites are all tapas) all have one spectacular dish that keeps me coming back. I can't say that this one had any stunners. I probably missed something!"}
{"text":"Love the look and atmosphere of Bar Isabel. It's feels and looks like I am eating in Spain. The place is quite busy and smells so good. Had the roast bone marrow, Bincho-Grilled Ibérico Pork Presa Scallions Espellete Butter Sauce and the Leche Frita & Salted Dulce de Leche, was really good. Recommend everyone to eat here once."}
{"text":"Disappointing, will not return. Especially for the price, the food is mediocre. The menu is pretentiously confusing, and the service doesn't help guide you. What is a vegan no show salad? Turns out it was the best dish we tried, but you wouldn't know what to expect from the menu. Cheese selection looks good, but nothing we tried was flavourful. Feel like I wasted my time and money here"}
{"text":"Stunning...I have never given a 5 star review in my life. This place is almost perfect.....food, drink and atmosphere are amazing....if you can get in go...."}
{"text":"Very professional service. Perfect atmosphere. Tasty tapas. Awesome Cocktails. Orgasmic Basque Cake and Sherry! --one of the best desserts I've ever tried. I'll stop by again just for this cake."}
{"text":"I visited Bar Isabel this weekend with my family to celebrate a special occasion. My mom and I had both visited the restaurant before, but as first-timers, my brother and dad were both initially a little overwhelmed by the loudness of the space. My mom and I laughed and justified that it just makes for a more \"authentic Spanish experience,\" the boys needed a little more convincing.   We decided to do tapas and a couple bigger sharing plates, ordering the bread, olives, the meat board, the cheese board, 4 pieces of the sobrasada and foie gras, the half octopus and the 8oz bavette.   The chef chose what would go on the cheese and meat boards, and they were both excellent. The sobrasada and foie gras was my favorite thing I had that night; the touch of honey is literally one of the best bites I've tasted in a really long time. The octopus was excellent; couldn't have been cooked more perfectly. The bavette was great as well, although half the table thought it was a little too rare.  For dessert, between the four of us we shared the squash ice cream and the basque cake with sherry cream. The ice cream wasn't my favorite dessert. While I'm all about creative flavours, the combination of brown butter yogurt, squash, sunflower seeds and pomegranate felt a little too much like a protein shake I would drink after a workout. The cake on the other hand, was perfect. Could have had the whole thing to myself, maybe two.  Service was excellent; the staff was super knowledgeable and friendly. The drinks were great, we did wine by the glass and everyone was very happy with what they got. Cappuccinos at the end of the meal were really good. Overall great experience and would definitely go back. Not an inexpensive meal, but you're paying for creativity and consistently well-executed food, so I'd say its worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I think Bar Isabel was overhyped for me. I expected out-of-this-world amazing food that I would remember every bite of, but I ended up getting really good food, but pretty pricey. The only reason I would go back this year is if I were taking my parents out for dinner, but otherwise, I can't imagine going back."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in TO right now. The bone marrow is always good. The octopus is off the charts. The drinks are stiff and delicious."}
{"text":"Definition of Bar Isabel: An overpriced place that serves small portions of bad quality  food THAT DOSENT TASTE good!! If you don't like don't pretend to,just because it's rated highly or your friends like it.Don't just go there because it's voted  highly.Nowadays that's what people do! I'm writing you this review do you don't waste $150 on bad overpriced food. No offense to the owner"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the food at all. We ordered the bone marrow, ceviche, octopus and bisque cake for desert. The food is too greasy and so so.  Totally not worth the money.  Do not bother to make the reservation one month in advance.  The service was good though.  Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"Not the best Tapas I've been to (Torito in Kensington Market is wonderful) but nice.  Very pricy, very pretentious, very overrated.  Food was slightly better than average quality, but outrageously priced for the quality.  Service was average, ambience was average, selection was average. Very young clientele (23-27-ish)."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere!, I am definitely coming back next time I am in Toronto. Excellent service and friendly staff, we sat in the bar with my husband and enjoyed every minute there.  Loved the Papas Bravas and the Garlic Snow Pea Leaves ummmmm. The only reason why I would not give the 5 stars is because they do not have Wifi and some of us rely on Wifi to survive as we are only visiting the city for a few days...  Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with fresh, high quality ingredients you can really taste! We were there on a Tuesday night with a last-minute reservation (super lucky) and there were people waiting at the door when we were finishing up. So make sure you make a reservation!  Prices are on-par with other popular tapas/ small plates restaurants (aka...pricy). It definitely adds up when you want to try a bit of everything. Cocktails seemed to average around $16. I had the \"My Favourite Ex-Girlfriend\" - it was the perfect balance of sweet and fruitiness!  Highlights of the meal were: - half octopus - eggplant with romesco sauce - squash ice cream (I believe this one is seasonal, so go try it before it's too late!)"}
{"text":"This cute little joint gets packed, and fast!  I went here yesterday with my friend, and we didn't have reservations so we lined up shortly before they opened at 6.  We managed to get a tiny table at the front.  Drinks:  I mean, they are known for their cocktails and I enjoyed the two that I had.  I had the Helpless (or Hopeless?) Mermaid, and the Four Letter.  Both were complex and not too sweet, with just enough kick of alcohol - basically, a real cocktail.  The drinks were definitely on the pricier side ($14 - $16).  Appetizers: We shared the Chorizo + Octopus, Fried Chicken with Buttermilk Sauce, and the Mussels.  I was pleasantly surprised by the food because I had only expected average.  The Chorizo + Octopus was a flavourful delight, and not too salty - definitely my favourite out of the three, though the buttermilk sauce was delicious and made a relatively plain dish, less plain.  Ambiance: Cute nook bar style (kind of reminds me of the decor of a smoky pub where the regulars hang out, minus the smoke) with a very mixed and eclectic crowd (old couples, young couples, locals, hipsters...?).  I find it a datey and intimate spot, but quite packed and a good starting point if you plan on hitting the bars later on in your night.  Service: Service was generally friendly, but I definitely found it a bit slow.  Our food did not come for a while, but fortunately, we were enjoying our cocktails.  There was a fairly decent refill of water, but service overall was on the slower side (probably because they are so busy!)."}
{"text":"We were left a little disappointed given all of the hype of bar Isabel. We had Oysters to start which were great.. We had also ordered a meat and cheese plate hat didn't come for 45 minutes.. We reminded the server we ordered it and rather than owning up to the mistake of not punching it in he punched it in then and made us continue to wait without an apology. When it finally came it was decent. We also had the steak tartar which was really good but we weren't overly fond of the  rice cake cracker base. Next up was the octopus! Something we heard major hype about and had to try.. Again not bad at all but given all of the hype we were just left underwhelmed. Great assortment of cocktails though! I would for sure go back and try some other drink and food options!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were first time visitors to Toronto and were lucky enough to run into some friendly locals who highly recommended we dine at Bar Isabel. They talked it up for a while and boy were they on point. As I told my server on the way out \"This is the best food I have ever eaten in my life.\" And I was not exaggerating. The off the menu drink that the bar tender made for me was exactly what my taste buds desired, and the food was beyond delicious (we had the stinky cheese, leeks, octopus/sausage skewers, and fried chicken), everything melted in my mouth. The atmosphere is perfect for both a date spot or just to eat casually with friends. I hope to return to Toronto and if I do I will certainly come back to this gem."}
{"text":"Awesome food...soooo good. Had the tuna, sweet bread, bone marrow and octopus. Good ambience too!"}
{"text":"One of the most amazing meals I've ever had in Toronto! Definitely worth the wait for reservations!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Toronto, hands down.  What a gift to this great city.  Service is great, bar and food are top notch.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Of course you MUST GO to Bar Isabel!  You must enjoy the cocktails, the small plates, the amazing wine and superb yet understated service.   WARNING:   1)If you haven't been to Spain, or other quality restaurants, you may not appreciate the attention to detail that informs the experience.   2)If you do not eat meat, if you don't enjoy sharing your food/small plates and if your preference is for a more predictable \"white table cloth\" (e.g. boring) experience, this is likely not the restaurant for you.   3) If you are going ONLY because the restaurant appears at the top of everyone's list, this is likely not the restaurant for you.  If you want a spectacular, creative meal in a room that is appealing despite at times a frenetic and cacophonous environment, this is the restaurant for you.   PS - don't be blindsided/distracted by the celebrity you will see in the room - the Bar Isabel staff clearly are professionals. Kudos to Bar Isabel for making everyone feel they are a valued and wanted customer."}
{"text":"The octopus melts in your mouth.  I also highly recommend the ceviche and the flat bread with 'stinky' cheese. They have a corkage fee as well."}
{"text":"I agree with many others saying this place is overpriced. Although the food is great, the price is way too high for the small portion. Three bite size sweetbread was around $30. Our server was amazing. He checked up on us regularly and always kept our cups full. I would come back here but only for a special occasion"}
{"text":"You definitely need to try the grilled octopus here! Amazing. Everything we ordered was pretty good -- from food to cocktails. Portions are relatively small so you'll need or order more.  Decor of the place is a bit rustic / outdated, otherwise I would give this place a 5-star. Very busy and you generally need to book in advance."}
{"text":"I went here with my hubby and 2 other ppl for New Years Eve.  I'm vegan so I really didn't eat much, but all their food looked amazingly good. No one complained once about the food that was flowing on our table. I was definitely wasn't complaining about my drinks. They have a great selections of drinks.   I rarely give 5 stars to a restaurant, but this place went above and beyond. I forgot who was it that served our table, but that dude was down right beyond awesome that i had to give him an extra $20 above the 20% tip i gave on the bill. I\"m not rich, but I know awesome service when i experience one. This place isn't cheap or semi-pricey. It's pricey and our bill came out lil under $500 for 4 ppl including tax & tips (20%).  So save up for this awesome place. I recommend it and would be back for this place.  **Highly recommend the leek appetizer dish**"}
{"text":"Awesome service and even more awesome food. Sat at the bar and had the Chorizo Verde with marinated Escarole, the charred Leeks with wild Mushrooms and fermented Peppers and the Manila Clams with Chorizo Mortadella. All delicious with a glass of Tempranillo. Jordy's attentive service made it all the better."}
{"text":"Tons of delicious food; a culinary fireworks if you will. And we did.  I didn't get to meet Isabel, but she seems like a great gal."}
{"text":"First thing to note, make RSVP. Second to note, the price. Third to note, worth a try!   Came here for dinner with couple friends. The server quickly got our drinks order and explained to us our menu. He suggested that we opt for $50 menu option where the house takes care of the options. Of course with consideration of your likes and dislikes, anything that you are dying to try. We got roughly about 5 tapas dishes, seafood platter and dessert. There is always at one piece for everyone and some dishes aren't small so you get filled up by the end. Notable mentions are the seafood platter, octopus and of course the dessert. Drinks start at around $10, their highly recommended cocktails are around $15. I opted for GT and English pale ale draught, both were great. Definitely a place to dine for a special occasion or a night out treat!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a restaurant with a unique menu, Bar Isabel is your place. Very eccentric but delicious dishes. Very casual and friendly atmosphere!  The corn ice cream with spicy caramel and roasted walnuts was awesome. While it may sound funky, the bone marrow is an absolute must as well. The cocktails were also creative and tasty. Great for couples or groups of friends!"}
{"text":"I'm in love! I'm in love! I'm in love and I don't care who knows it!! Her name is Isabel, well some people call her Bar Isabel...but she meets all the criteria of what I'm looking for in a girl. First, she is very accommodating and I was able to reserve some of her time a day before I saw her! When I arrived and entered the door to meet her I was greeted with the smell every man looks for in a woman, that perfect combination of octopus, bread and booze. Boy, oh, boy I knew I was in for a treat!   Now word on the street was Isabel got around with a bunch of different people and the night I arrived was no different. I knew monogamy was out of the question but that was OK because that sweet angel Isabel, she treated me like no other. She really took her time to service my every need if you know what I'm talking about. She described in detail everything she was going to do to me so that when it came time to order I knew without hesitation. I was a little nervous because I usually don't do this sort of thing so I loosened up with a delicious beer I've never tried. Once the sweet taste of alcohol hit my lips my inhibitions disappeared and I knew things were going to get interesting.   Now I'm not one to shy away from foreplay. I've learned about its importance from the magazines that line checkout stalls but I felt a little bit intimidated by Isabel. That was not a worry though because Isabel knew exactly how to start things off.  We slowly embraced each other and began with some shisito peppers. Never have peppers felt or tasted so good on my lips. My body's senses started heightening and I could feel my stomach slowly begin to pulse. My breathing was getting heavier and as soon as we finished the peppers Isabel brought some Sobrassada & Foie Gras. Ohhhhh ya the crispiness of the bread and flakiness of the foie gras sent a rush through my esophagus. I could feel things getting heavier and heavier the anticipation building with each bite.  We continued and she started getting really nasty now. She was showing off her dirty side with some blood sausage and patatas bravas which had me purring like a cat in heat. At this point I thought I was going to explode with pleasure at any second. As soon as she brought out the Octopus my entire body was on edge. It was one of the most delicious things I've ever had.  I was starting to reach my peak, one bite of deliciousness after another, faster and faster, oh my god I couldn't stop now, bite, bite, bite, I couldn't hold it - the pleasure moved to the tips of my toes and then 8 OZ BAVETTE, 8 OZ BAVETTE, 8 OZ BAVETTE!!!! My entire body released a wave of pleasure stronger than all the heroin in Toronto. Ahhh amazing. We caught our breath and ate some delicious basque cake with sherry cream which would have had me going for round 2 but I was still tired.  Some say love like that doesn't come around very often and I tend to agree.  Even though I had to pay pretty handsomely for her services Isabel delivered and I know this was not just a one night stand. I will see that sweet girl again and until then she will linger in my dreams."}
{"text":"Didn't really feel the hype. Service seemed aloof. Dishes were quality but not that interesting. Espana in Vancouver is superior in my opinion."}
{"text":"The best new tapas bar in Toronto. Especially recommended the Chips, Boquerones, Piquillo, Jalepeno and the Bone marrow."}
{"text":"3/5! I was disappointed with this place. After all the blogs and raving reviews I was expecting a lot more. Granted, the grilled octopus salad was fantastic and deserves a 5/5, but the other tapas were average. I was not overly impressed by the drinks we were recommended by the waiter (def had better cocktails in that area). Unfortunately, I disagree with the hype :("}
{"text":"This place is overrated.  I was excited to try this place as it's rated by many (chowhound, magazines, publications) as one of the top restaurants in Toronto.    We ordered the following.  Of the 14 dishes that we ordered the only standouts were the basque cake and the sweetbreads and raw tuna.  All the other dishes were very mediocre:  -Selection of 12 Oysters(3/5): This was average and nothing out of the ordinary  -Scallops & Mojo verde(3.5/5): Basically scallops with special garlic sauce.  It's tasted slightly above average  -Galician Razor Clams (3/5): Basically 6 clams with olives on top  -Adobo Pork & Quail Egg(3/5): Seems like a lot of ingredients but it lacked any dimension and the ingredients didn't go well together  -Sobrasada & Foie Gras(3/5): Not very memorable. 2 small pieces on toast?  You could probably get a whole slab of foie gras from other high end restaurants for the same price.   -Shishito Peppers (3/5): This was okay  -Patatas Bravas & Boquerones (3/5): Potatoes were hot but hard.  For $5 more you get like 1 bite of boquerones.  Just get the patatas bravas alone for $9 don't do the upgrade(totally not worth it).  -Roast Bone Marrow (3/5): Nothing too special if you had it before  -Sweetbreads & Raw Tuna (4/5): This was one of the better dishes.  Sweetbreads go very well with the raw tuna at the bottom and all kinds of flavour bursting in your mouth  -Basque Seafood Hotpot (2/5): Worst dish of the night.  Seafood(scallops, mussels, and clams) weren't fresh.  No wonder they put it in a sour-tomato based sauce to mask the seafood.  -Morcilla & Foie Gras (3.5/5): Seared foie gras was good but didn't go well with the morcilla  -Half Octopus (3.5/5): Octopus was tender but not spectacular taste wise  -Chocolate & Tarragon Ice Cream Bar (3/5): Forgettable  -Basque Cake & Sherry Cream (4.5/5): This is the highlight of the night but too little too late   I wished I had read more of the 1-3 stars reviews on Yelp instead of concentrating on the 4-5 stars reviews.   For the price, please go somewhere else.  You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is to me, the best restaurant in the city. Every dish was perfect from the sardines, to the steak, to the sweetbreads, to the blistered peppers. Basque cake for dessert was my favourite dessert all time. Service is perfect. Try it. You will not regret Bar Isabel."}
{"text":"We heard all the hype about this octopus so we came to check it out. great texture, not overly chew, flavour was ok -  nothing overwhelming spectacular for the price. May go again if I am in the area but probably won't make a trip specifically to eat here."}
{"text":"What a great place! Nice atmosphere (just a little loud). Great attentive service. The food was just fantastic.  Took the advice of other reviewers and we ordered the following (we were 4): bread, olives, salumi platter, devilled eggs, supreme potatoes, fish ceviche, whole octopus, tongue brioche, fried chicken, basque cake and salted chocolate dessert. The ceviche and the octopus were the highlights.  Just amazing.  Better than some of the great seafood that we have had in Miami. The eggs and the potatoes were fantastic as well. The tongue brioche and the fried chicken were good but not out of this world. Everyone needs to try this restaurant.  Totally worth all the accolades that it has been getting."}
{"text":"What a great find! We went on a Monday night and it was packed. The ambiance was fun and upbeat. Our waiter helped us find a great red wine to pair with our meal.  We were 4 people and we shared the pan con tomate (a simple yet delicious and refreshing dish), the cheese platter (yummy), the spicy cauliflour, the octopus, and a whole lot more. Everything was scrumptious. Down to the smallest detail.  The decor of the place is also quite ecclectic and cozy. The vibe overall was awesome."}
{"text":"We chose Bar Isabel to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and were very disappointed. We had to book a month in advance to get a table during their first sitting which was fine due to the hype this restaurant has. As soon as we sat down we felt instantly judged by our sever and got the minimum amount of attention. We found the crostini apps were much to sweet and stopped the other flavours from coming through. The olives and meat plate were very good. We then had the chorizo sausage stew which we both found bland and very basic for the price. I would not go back and believe this restaurant is completely fuelled by the hype."}
{"text":"The food and drinks here are a definite 5/5. Their wine list is extremely well put together and all 4 of the cocktails I tried on my first visit were well worth the cost. The service is pretty good but my waitress didn't really contribute much other than taking my order and bringing the bill (both of which took a very long time). I'm not a huge fan of these support run front of house systems. The bussers were amazing, listing all the ingredients, answering questions and refilling everything promptly. I wish my tip was going straight to them, they seemed a lot more knowledgeable and ended up doing 90% of the work."}
{"text":"I finally had dinner at Bar Isabel after hearing many good reviews about the tapas bar.   My friend and I ordered the half octopus, sausage party, bread, olives and cheese plate to share. This was more than enough for the two of us. (The waitress recommended 4-5 dishes for a party of two.)  The cheese plate was great and featured 3 types of cheeses. I would recommend ordering bread to go with the cheese. The olives were seasoned with paprika which added an interesting kick to the dish.  The sausage party was not as great as I thought it would be. It was quite small. However, I did enjoy the chorizo verde sausage.  After hearing great reviews about the octopus, we had to try it. In terms of texture it was great! It was crispy on the outside but soft on the inside. It could have been seasoned a bit better though. (There was a sauce and some jalapeños but it would have been great if there was just a little more spice).   Overall it was a great experience. It is definitely a spot that you go to not too often as it can be on the pricier side."}
{"text":"Went to Bar Isabel for dinner with a girlfriend before she moves away, since I've been hearing such great things about it!   We shared 5 dishes: smoked sweetbreads (my favorite--outstanding dish), whole sea bream ceviche, a raw scallop dish, seared foie gras and the octopus.  The sweetbreads were so good, very tender and for some reason they reminded me of the sauerkraut buns my baba used to make. That alone made me pretty happy, whether it was their intended taste profile or not.  The whole sea bream ceviche was yummy, perhaps a bit heavy on the lime (my gf noted this, I liked the level of citrus), but the best part was the deep fried \"fish wings\" and the tender cheeks hidden beneath the cornstarch crust. Yum yum, thank you to our server for pointing that out!  The raw scallop dish had really nice flavor, I love honey crisp apples and that ingredient helped me enjoy the dish. The sauce on the dish was rather salty, but I just avoided adding more to my scallops. The seared foie was delicous, but unremarkable for a foie dish. Nothing new and exciting, but if you don't need that, it's a good choice. I wasn't able to eat the blood sausage, which could have changed my perception. The best part about the octopus dish was the potatoes, the octopus itself was overcooked but they were kind to take it off the bill.   We tried a few different kinds of wine too, I love that they are offering rather unknown styles of Spanish wines which are excellent examples of what the Spanish can do. The Txakolina (that's the only word I remember), a $15 white by the glass, was our favorite.  Not cool though, I had ordered a delicious scotch cocktail to start called \"The Glass Cage of Emotion\" and boy, I certainly became one when the person who delivered our wine took away my glass that had at least a finger of liquid in it without asking whether I was done with it! Who does that, especially when drinks are no less than $15 per?  That was the most disappointing moment, and then the octopus. 4*s, great service otherwise. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Cocktails are bomb, some can get a little expensive but the quality of the food and everything is unmatched. Great place to go with some friends! Open later than most places ive been too."}
{"text":"No real disappointments here.  Two of us arrived prime time (7:30ish) on a Saturday without reservations and were seated at the bar.  Loss of star comes partially from the repeated statements that we would only be permitted to have the seats for an hour or so .  In the end, we managed to hang around for close to two hours, but they did hustle us out just as we were about to request the bill.  Shared everything.  Started with oysters, which were great. Their bread has to be the greatest in the city; likewise for the amazing olive oil it's served with.  Roasted bone marrow is what it is, but elevated when spread on said bread. We added some chorizo to the cheese plate - chorizo melts in your mouth. Followed these snacks with a half octopus (this or the whole one is a must when stopping here), which is cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of charred edges. Thought the sweetbreads and raw tuna were an odd combination, but they went well together.  The sweetbreads were soft and tender.  We also had a stew, the contents of which are escaping me, but the tomato based sauce was great (particularly, again, with the bread).  We skipped dessert as we were too busy with the amazing beer list.  Beer fans can enjoy a lot of selections typically found at the city's best beer bars with elevated cuisine."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in the city!  I had heard so many good things for so long about Bar Isabel but was a little concerned about some of the \"adventurous\" things on the menu (I'm a pretty picky eater). A lot of the most popular items on the menu here are things I do not eat (raw tuna, octopus, beef tongue, bone marrow to name a few) so I was a bit worried that I wouldn't get the \"true\" experience.  My concerns were definitely unnecessary.  My fiance and I loved everything we ordered! The rib-eye with the chimichurri sauce - wow amazing. Have never had chimichurri but now I'll want it with all my steaks.  We also really enjoyed the chickpea salad - which the server recommended.  I didn't think it was possible for a chickpea salad to be so delicious. It had a bit of kick though (I'm pretty sensitive to chilies I think). My favourite dish was the patatas bravas supreme-o.  We've had something similar at other tapas places, and this one blew all others out of the water!  The potatoes were perfectly crispy but also so soft and creamy inside!  And I couldn't get enough of the sauce drizzled all over. We ordered the albacore tuna - which I tried a small bite of but my aversion to raw fish took over and I couldn't eat more. My fiance liked it though. We also had the scotch egg which was good.  For dessert we ordered the basque cake with the sherry cream sauce - this was a highlight for both of us. Best dessert I've ever had at a restaurant. Maybe I also really enjoyed it because it was unique - something I've never had or heard of. Can't wait to come back here.  The service was great even though the restaurant was completely full (on a Monday night!). We made reservations a few weeks in advance and only came on a weeknight because we couldn't get a decent time slot on a weekend. The cocktail menu is interesting - drinks were strong as they should be for the price :)"}
{"text":"Amazing food even for picky eaters like myself. I wouldn't normally order dishes like chicken liver but this restaurant completely changed my mind! I decided to open up my horizons and ordered blindly and I honestly enjoyed every dish! I recommend this restaurant to anybody looking for a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"Every once in a while there comes a place that turns you upside down and dangles you by your left foot until you get it. Thanks Bar Isabel, I get it!  I love the vibe of this place. Cool, relaxed, and lacking any pretension whatsoever. We were warmly received, with at least 4 staff welcoming us in. Whoa. We're off to a good start.  The space itself is nicely laid out. Most restaurants that I've been to on/near the Ossington strip lack space, and this was the antithesis of that. Generously sized tables with enough room so that you're not breathing down your neighbour's shoulder.  My friend and I shared 4 dishes in all. They came out in a progression of lightest to heaviest, which I found quite thoughtful.  1) Chips, Boquerones (Anchovies marinated in Vinegar), Piquillo, and Pickled Jalapenos  One of the best things I have eaten in a long time! I had a major ah-ha moment post-consumption. Like, hello, where have you been all my life?  The neutral corn based chips were the perfect base for the acidity of the remaining components. Honestly, I could have easily eaten 5 more orders of the same and called it a day. It really is that good.  2) Whole Sea Bream Ceviche  Really, the fish carcass was there purely for presentation. There really wasn't much flesh left on it to bother.  The Ceviche, however, was stellar. The fish was marinated just long enough so that it was half \"cooked\" and half raw. Combined with the avocado, a topping of crispy shredded seaweed and a sweet and tangy vinaigrette, it was a great combo of flavours and textures. Get it!  3) Patatas Bravas (Supreme-O Version with Morcilla)  Potatoes, Cream Based Sauce, Pickled Jalapenos, Blood Sausage. Don't say no. Just do it. SOOOO good!  4) Grilled Octopus  While I was blown away by how tender the Octopus was, I was not by the flavour profile of this dish. It was served with Potatoes, Fried Dandelion and Parsley. The Fried Dandelion was the most intriguing part of the plate. I think this needed a bit of acidity to bring all the elements together.  The bill for two clocked in just over $100. A bit pricey for Tapas, but given the attention to detail and quality of product used in each dish, it is understandable.  I look forward to returning with more friends down the road so I can try more things!"}
{"text":"Meh,  Every writer in the city likes to get together and circle jerk over this place, but seriously lets look objectively and what they are doing. I have given them a fair chance and do quite enjoy alot of what they are doing.  But it always seems to falls to the age-old problem of over-promise under-deliver. The sous-vide, then baked, then deep fried chicken wings were gristley and lacked the the final concept this many cooking techniques would yield to such an ingredient. I've had better at Odd Seoul and Duff's for much less the price. If it has that many cooking techniques administered to it before hand, I want rendered, crispy, tender chicken wings.... not meh  The Octopus, which had more raves, tasted as if it was thawed that day. Any self respecting restaurant in espana would have thrown this dish into the trash. I realize we are not on the a sea or ocean in Toronto ... but again don't promise me the world and deliver charred rubber tires  Other dishes as Snow Crab is incredibly hard to mess up honestly - but is good here as you would expect it to be.  Honestly its an average place with some above average dishes... perhaps deserves a 3 star but nothing more.   I imagine they give most food-writers from BlogTo and other chefs free drinks here, cause I do not see the magic...   Please help me see the magic"}
{"text":"By far the best meal I have had in Toronto. Amazing food, service and overall feel of the place was incredible. It feels both hip and also welcoming. I never felt like I wasn't 'cool' enough to be there. I will make sure to go to this restaurant as often as possible.I recommend the Sea Bream Ceviche! Be sure to make a reservation, otherwise you will be waiting a couple of hours to get a seat!"}
{"text":"Food, service, drinks and ambiance are unparalleled. So fantastic to have this quality of restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me by making a reservation and taking me here for some celebratory news and we were both disappointed in every aspect.   We had a variety of dishes from each section, we had the Bread, Cured Meat Plate, the Spicy Fried Squid, Crispy Tongue & Kale, Smoked Sweetbreads with Tuna, and 1/2 Grilled Octopus.   The bread and cured meat plate were good but nothing special, we were somewhat excited to try the cured horse on the plate and it was good, the rest were ok.  The Spicy Fried Squid was very underwhelming, the squid was soggy and kind of greasy and the \"crispy tongue and kale\" was chopped very finely and did not really add to the dish in the way of texture or flavor. Disappointing.  The Smoked Sweetbreads with Tuna was good, nice flavor but again I have had better sweetbreads in other restaurants such as the Black hoof in Toronto or Murrays in Ottawa. So meh.  The 1/2 grilled Octopus was excellent. It was the only dish that impressed us. The octopus had a nice smokey flavour and was tender, the accompanying potatoes were meh, all I can taste was lemon for the potatoes, but I loved the sauteed dandelions that came with it. The dandelions accompanied the octopus very well.  We had to wait very long more than 15 minutes between dishes especially the octopus (probably over 20mins from the dish before it). We considered cancelling to eat elsewhere (I wish we did!).  In addition to a somewhat mediocre meal and service for such a hyped up restaurant we sat next to the most obnoxious man ever. The seating there is somewhat cramped, but this RUDE man decided to sit on the \"bench\" side next to his lady companion. So they were both on the bench side seating, because he had to sleeze her up (this guy looked like sleezebag level 1000). This is ok if the seating spaces actually accommodates this, but it doesn't at Bar Isabel. IT IS NOT OK TO ENCROACH ON OTHER PEOPLE'S PRIVATE DINING SPACE.  He did not ask me if it was ok, but just sat on my stuff and expected ME to shift to the person next to me making us more cramped. Additionally he knocked down my husband's cycling cap and stepped on it later on and no apologies. Obnoxious dining neighbors makes everything worse. The servers saw I was uncomfortable and didn't care. My husband logged a complaint later on with the front of house, and basically they apologized but didn't give two craps.  Overall, I really did not enjoy my experience there at all, I was so looking forward to trying this place for months and it was super underwhelming. For an over $100 bill for two for food only, with the generally mediocre food and service, it definitely does not live up to the hype. Two stars because I actually enjoyed one of the dishes a lot."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about how much I Love Bar Isabel.  Great cocktails and amazing food.  The octopus is the best I have ever tasted!  I only left 1 star off because I can't always get a table."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is the best restaurant in Toronto. Hands down. I've eaten at nearly all of them.  In terms of quality of food, cocktails, wine and beer list, service and atmosphere, Bar Isabel reigns supreme. Sometimes I would show up alone just to sit at the bar and enjoy a nice glass of wine with some oysters, cheese and their house-baked bread. The servers were always friendly and made good conversation, and I had a number of weird and wonderful encounters with other patrons.  Must-haves (if they're on the menu as it can change): octopus, spicy fried squid, sweedbreads & raw tuna (the best I've ever had), bone marrow, foie gras and morcilla and of course, the basque cake. Heaven."}
{"text":"Don't come if you expect to have a conversation. We were there late with a party of 4 and they were not full but even the waiter could not hear us and had to bend over to each person to get the order. They should do something about the acoustics.   We had excellent octopus, bread and cheese. Cocktails were very good.  One problem was that the wait staff (who were great on refilling water), were a bit too hovering. They kept trying to take our bread away before we were through with it and finally got it when we were not looking. They also kept coming and re-folding the napkins while we were still at the table. Had a bit of a feeling they were acting out Michelin quality.  Has good potential. I would love to try other dishes but would not return with high noise level. What is the point of being out with people? We just gestured at each other. And yes, one at our table had to whip out a phone light to see the menu. Great place to take someone for good food if it is someone you just want to look at and not talk to."}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Fabulous food, excellent service. Drinks are $$$ so maybe have one or two before you come.   Octopus is unique and wonderful, sweetbreads, fried chicken and tongue all delicious. Salumi platter is a must order. Make reservations 6 weeks in advance."}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to snag a table for 5 at Bar Isabel, which was packed to the rafters on a Monday night. A good sign of things to come.  Our table ordered small plates over the course of the evening. Started with some delicious bread with a warm crunchy crust and some of the best olive oil I've tasted in the city. The superbly tender and perfectly sauced Chicken Wing Escabeche followed, along with the divine and creamy Devilled Duck Egg topped with blood sausage, and Salumi Plate with cured meats sliced so thin it was almost transparent. The Water Buffalo was definitely the star of the Salumi Plate, if not only for its uniqueness. The Roast Bone Marrow was surprisingly disappointing as ours was small and  marrow-less, whereas our neighbours' was heaping with the yummy stuff. Definite food envy.  We moved onto the daily whole fish ceviche served with the skeleton, head and tail intact and mixed with avocado. The fish was firm which was a nice contrast to the creamy soft avocado. We also ordered half an octopus, which is usually not allowed but a nearby table also wanted a half order and so we split it. Arrived extremely tender  and plentiful, definitely enough for 5 people.  The space is beautiful and eclectic, with mismatched lamps and soft lighting. It gets loud so be prepared to shout a little during dinner. At times it was hard to get our server's attention so expect a slower pace of service.  Overall a very pleasant dining experience and a welcomed addition to this strip of College."}
{"text":"I've been hearing great things about this place, so I thought I'd give it a shot. It was packed from the moment it opened at 6 on a Friday night, but my friends and I were lucky when a party of 3 cancelled and we got their table with minimum wait!  The atmosphere is very lively and loud. Warm decor, and all the waiters are very courteous and attentive. We had a great waiter who was friendly and made sure we always had clean plates and a drink. I'd say the service was a surprise, because it felt almost fine-dining quality for a tapas bar.   Food was excellent, and also reasonably priced. What will kill your bill are the drinks, with average prices of $15. I got the lovage smash and the elder flame - most of their cocktails are gin based and they like to infuse ingredients. Very complex cocktails. They also have a decent selection of beers.   We started with the classic bone marrow. The portion served was more than Black Hoof, and also for cheaper price. Can't really go wrong with a nicely roasted bone marrow, very creamy and smooth.  We had the mussels escabeche, one of the okay dishes but still pretty good. Fresh mussels in a sauce worth soaking your bread in to have every last drop.  Our third tapas plate was slices of foie gras on top of smoked apple chutney and blood sausage, served with a mini brioche. Very decadent - the flavours worked well together and spread across the brioche perfectly.  My favourite was our last dish, the grilled pork loin with maple smoked kim chi sauce and green beans. I've never had such a moist and juicy pork loin, and the spice rub was perfectly flavoured and seasoned. The side rim of fat melted in your mouth and the sauce was delicious - you could detect that hint of smoke, but was sweet with a kick of spice at the end. I could've eaten 2 more of those.   Overall, I had a great time. I loved the atmosphere, the service was great, the food was even better. Our bill came out to 60/person - but when you take away 30 for the drinks, it's pretty reasonable in fact.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Isabel since they opened and it is consistently a great experience. The room is warm, cozy, vibrant and loud. The service is impeccable with excellent, attentive staff who are knowledgeable, personable and down to earth. Cocktails are unbelievable. Try the choose your own adventure cocktail and you provide three descriptors to the bartender who makes you something with those characteristics. Excellent beer/wine list. The food. This is why we keep coming back. The stand outs for us are always the whole fish ceviche and the pork loin, which I could eat a mountain of. Recent addition of Save room for basque cake."}
{"text":"Came here last night and had an amazing dinner. Everything was perfect. The food was absolutely delicious ( I tried the cheese platter, octopus, hot pot, and oysters) ... I ordered a \"my favourite ex girlfriend\" cocktail that was awesome as well. The service was great ; our water was always filled, plates constantly cleared, food timing was perfect, and our server helped us understand the menu more thoroughly and had good recommendations. Very glad I discovered how close this restaurant is to my new apartment as I will definitely be coming back to bar Isabel !"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had in a looooooong time.  I frequently travel to New York where tapas style is very popular and I think this place was better than any of the ones I have tried there.  The prices for the food are also very reasonable.  I would have given this place five stars, however, I had to dock it a star because the average cocktail price is 15 dollars.  No drink is worth 17 bucks, I don't care how many ounces you put in it.  That being said, the food was fantastic, the tuna and sweetbreads were out of this world!!"}
{"text":"What. A. Treat. Came in on a surprisingly bustling Monday night. Ordered croquettes (oozy cheesy deliciousness), patatas bravas (Aka, GoT potatoes), mushrooms and lentils, and a pork and octopus special. Between two people, it was a bit too much ... Took home leftovers for an epic breakfast. We sat at the bar, which I both generally prefer and recommend for this restaurant. Service was attentive and polite, without any of that condescending b.s. that can sometimes happen at restaurants. Cocktails were outstanding and interesting, if not a bit strong. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The food here was really great! I came here with five other people and we shared everything so it was a great way to taste most of the items on the menu.  I started with the L'ange de L'assassinat for cocktails. It's 2.5 ounces, and at $15, it didn't blow my mind. It honestly tasted like lime juice with some sparkling water and a little bit of alcohol, so I was a little disappointed.  To begin, we had the cheese platter and the toast with a quail's egg, blood sausage and shrimp on top. The latter was really divine. We also got the sweetbreads with tuna (a definite favourite!). The razor clams were great, but a little too lemony and sour for my liking. The patatas bravas were amaaazing! The bone marrow paled in comparison to everything else and the chimichurri sauce was too overpowering and didn't let the bone marrow shine through. Our final dish was half an octopus over potatoes and rapini/dandelion (?) greens. This dish was also amazing. The octopus was cooked just right and the potatoes were so good! But the greens were way too bitter.  To end, we had the basque cake - divine!   Highly recommend this place. You have to make an order of bread separately, and I made the mistake of eating too much bread!"}
{"text":"You did it again Bar Isabel. Have I told you lately, that I love you?  That octopus, THAT OCTOPUS. Amazing.  Get the rib eye, just do it. It's the best I've ever had.  New favourite cocktail - land of the vandal.  Happy new year guys!"}
{"text":"Somewhat of a hyped up place. Split the bone marrows, oysters, half octopus, razor clams and the cake with my boyfriend. Everything were decent and cooked well. The only wow factors were the razor clams and the cake. The razor clams had a very good combination of flavours and the cake was just to die for: soft inside and crunchy outside. I would go back just for these two items. All above dishes plus a drink each cost us $150"}
{"text":"Overall great creativity with the dishes. Had the octopus and charcuterie starter. Octopus was worth trying, but not something I'd order again (a bit bland in certain parts). I will say the vibe of the restaurant was great and you do get some quality food. However, the pricing for the relatively small portions tipped the scales for me."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Try to sit at the back rather than the front section of very small tables (usually reserved for walk-ins). For two people, I think you'd be happy getting one large dish to share and 2-3 small plates. That should run you (without drinks) to about $80 after tax. Not unreasonable for such a great restaurant.   One of the very few places that does seafood well in Toronto. I've had spicy crab legs and a lobster chowder (with a 1.5 lb full lobster floating around it) and both were fantastic. Drinks are very well prepared as well, although you'll probably be paying $15 a cocktail."}
{"text":"Went for someone's birthday. Overall I would rate the experience a 'meh'. For the reputation and the prices I expected 1) better service 2) a better overall experience. The food is typical farmer fair in Europe. Nothing fancy. They've dressed it up a bit. But frankly, I ate this food growing up. It tasted better.   The wine. 40$ for an 11$ at best bottle. Which you can buy in Europe for 2 EU. Basically. Underwhelmed.   If you must try it go ahead. But, honestly you're probably better off at a restaurant that takes itself less seriously."}
{"text":"Went here last night with a friend and was blown away with how lovely this place is. The decor is very authentic and warm - although the place was packed it didn't feel overcrowded. There are a few reviews critiquing the small plates - its a tapas place, guys. Our waiter communicated this right up front and seemed very proud and excited about the food.   My favourite part was the cocktails - the bartenders here are artists and make a lot of their bitters in-house. I had the \"favourite ex-girlfriend\" which is dangerously good as well as some wonderful gingery citrus concoction made by Leah.   I got spoiled and tried the following off ther menu, in addition to some sort of sausage that I couldn't find:  Spicy Oyster Escabeche, Whitefish Roe & Dill  Jamon Croquetas, Torta De Dehesa & Sobrassada Chips, Boquerones, Piquillo & Jalapeño Sobrassada, Foie Gras & Honey Montadito Roast Bone Marrow Roasted King Crab w/ Crab Bisque B.C. Halibut & Green Pea Ceviche Basque Cake & Sherry Cream  Everything was beautifully prepared and plated, but my favourite was definitely the oysters (perfect combination of flavours) and the croquettes (which are to-die-for mouth orgasms)."}
{"text":"After seeing it on basically every top ten list I finally came for dinner. We ordered the roast bone marrow (good), grilled octopus (excellent) and seared fois gras (meh). I was told the chorizo is good but it wasn't on the menu that day. Only complaint was it was a little loud inside, even by bar/hot spot standards. Staff were very nice and generous with their menu recommendations. Overall you should believe the hype and check this place out."}
{"text":"It was worth the 2 hour wait. We had desserts and drinks. Ambiance was great and good service."}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype around this place.   Drinks are not made well and they are tiny and service is extremely slow. We had already finished two hot apps when we got our first drinks.   Almost everything on the menu is bread and anchovies. I appreciate simplicity but this was so simple that I could have made it myself for 1/4 of the price. We ordered the steak, but 1/3 of it was inedible because it was all fat.   Really wanted to like the place but I just couldn't..."}
{"text":"It's rare that a popular restaurant fully lives up to its hype and even exceeds it - but Bar Isabel did. I made my reservation about a month in advance and managed to squeeze in on a weekday evening. My group of 6 shared the ceviche, sobrassada (3 orders) sweetbreads (2 orders), asparagus with sausage, whole octopus, ribeye, meat platter, jabon with bread, and the patatas with sausage. This came out to about $50 per person (only a couple of us had drinks), which was a fair price and much less than I had expected. The portions were not large but I was full at the end of the meal.   As I had chosen the restaurant, I was anxious that everyone enjoy the food - and they did. Group favorites were the sobrassada (so light and unique), sweetbreads, patatas and ceviche. I think the only thing I would skip next time is the meat platter - it was just alright in a sea of delicious dishes.  The service was prompt, friendly and informative - it is very busy so it can be hard to find your server sometimes but we never felt neglected. Constant checks for water and swaps of dishes. Everything was well timed and brought out from light to heavy.   Only thing to note is that it is very loud and rather dark in there - so if you're looking for somewhere to really catch up (and don't want to be yelling it to each other) this might not be the place for you.  Otherwise, make a reservation about two months in advance for your pick of the weekend, or about a month if you're flexible on the date."}
{"text":"Overrated, expensive and food with no flavour  Portions are small and are not good at all. Everything about this place is a gimmick."}
{"text":"This is really a 4.5 star review and I feel bad being particularly critical of Bar Isabel as the hype and expectation certainly made me more critical of the dining experience.   I came here with my girlfriend for our anniversary and ordered the Sobrassada, Foie Gras & Honey Montadito, roast bone marrow, whole sea bream ceviche, half octopus, and sweetbreads.  Let me start off by saying that was too much food by 1-1.5 dishes for my girlfriend and I and I'm a big eater.   The service was some of the best I've ever had at a restaurant. The first dish came very quickly and the subsequent dishes did not come until we were comfortably finished with the previous dish. The sequencing also made sense, with the bone marrow coming after the ceviche although the ceviche was a bigger dish.   I thought everything was delicious, but the bone marrow was stand-out for me as being a steal based on the quantity.   Given that every other part of my experience was amazing, I'll discuss the negatives. The half octopus dish was a bit too oily. While this wasn't a problem for the octopus itself, the rapini on the plate was drenched and every bite oozed buttery oil into your mouth. As an avid fan of cocktails, I also had high expectations and while the drinks were good, they were slightly overpriced compared to other great cocktail places around Toronto (IMO county general, cocktail bar, sidecar, temperance society). In particular, the grand slam fizz was a disappointment. It looked like a strawberry milkshake and kind of tasted like a very diluted version with a hint of absinthe.  Overall definitely worth going though and I will be back."}
{"text":"Found this gem while walking around Little Italy on a cold Saturday. There was a line outside the door just before 6pm and both my friend and I decided to go in on a whim. We walked in without a reservation and lucked out with a seat in a cramp corner right next to the bar. Most if not all the diners had reservations and would recommend one as the place was packed once it opened!   The service was excellent and with attentive wait staff.   The menu is definitely not your typical offerings. We ordered: -Patatas Bravas as an appetizer- amazing with a delicate yet flavourful sauce  -Smoked sweetbread (animal glands) served on albacore sashimi, persimmon & brown butter- something I was not familiar with or typically order- great flavours, a nice app but not my favourite   -Cuttlefish- pasta- divine!! First time trying this fish and loved every spoonful! Although simple in appearance and in flavour, the dish speaks volumes with the few ingredients it has  The drinks although expensive, offer a great variety from wines, good beer on tap, and great cocktails. Apparently, they are one of the best for gin and tonics- another reason to go back!!  Although small, Bar Isabel is a lively place with a younger crowd that offers amazing food and presentation.  I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 7/10 Overall experience: 9/10  I'll keep this short and sweet since others have definitely covered the pros and cons of our beloved Isabel.   The food here is really fantastic. They change their menu every so often to keep you on your toes. Some dishes I always enjoy - the bone marrow, octopus, meat/cheese board. For those that found themselves disappointed, it may be a symptom of having extremely high expectations. I think Bar Isabel definitely has one of, if not the best Spanish tapas foods in the city.   Overall, it is just a fun place to be any day of the week. It is always busy, the drinks and good and strong, and you just get quite comfortable and situated.   THE BOTTOM LINE: definitely worth going."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. Make sure you call ahead to book a reservation; otherwise, you may have to wait for an hour.  We had the fresh fish ceviche which was really fresh and I highly recommend ordering that.  We also ordered the grilled bone marrow and shishito peppers which were also relatively good - although I have had better (in Spain).  Overall, a really good experience.  It'd be a great place to take a date!"}
{"text":"So what do you get when you combine the efforts of Grant van Gameren and Max Rimaldi?   A frankenstein baby of food MAGIC!  The creative and carnal essence of Black Hoof combined with Italian stylings of Enoteca Sociale and Libretto -- I had high expectations and Bar Isabel did not disappoint!  OMG.  Where do I start. Ok, firstly. Reservations. Seriously!  OMG Cocktails. I ordered the \"Old Flame\" ($14). It may be one of the more expensive gin based drinks I have ordered, but I think you pay more because they bring a blow torch to the table and light it on fire! Hence the name.  The \"Woman Scorned\" is another popular drink with a story. Maybe they should introduce a cocktail \"Overly Sensitive Man\" and add some man tears.  OMG Food.  Give me more! 1) Horse Tatare Perfectly spiced, flavourful, with toasty bread.  2) Octopus with chorizo and peppers.   It was rubbery and fresh but not too difficult to chew.  The perfect portion for two people.    The whole octopus is popular but definitely for a small group. It reminds me a little of Pirates of the Carribean. Baby grilled Kraken -- I'd eat that.  3) Fried Chicken and Eggplant The fried chicken was decent but not out of this world. The Eggplant was oily and spicy and surprisingly addictive and I might have liked it more than the chicken.  3) Ceviche was presented on the whole fish. Could have used a bit more acid, we did have to work a bit to get around fish bones, but it was still a fun dish to order.  We didn't get dessert, perhaps next time.  Bar Isabel is one of my new favourite spots for sharing plates.   I can't wait to come back! =D"}
{"text":"We went here for Saturday night and ordered multiple dishes. The ones that really stood out were the ceviche, patatas bravas and the basque cake. I meant to get the basque cake to go as I was pretty full by the end but it was so good with the sherry cream poured on top that I finished it all. Definitely a must have if you have any kind of a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"A few friends of mine and I went to Bar Isabel for a group dinner. We opted for the taste testing; recommended by our lovely server. We had the pan con tomato, the cheese/ meat platter, the spicy cauliflour, the octopus, sardines with jalapeños, clams (which were amazing), and a few other foods that were equally excellent. Although we found the portions a bit small for the 8 of us, the food was mouthwatering; there wasn't a single crumb left.   The atmosphere is great; dim and romantic but fun and upbeat. The staff are wonderful, very friendly and outgoing - and they knew their stuff which is always a bonus!   The only reservation I have about Bar Isabel is the price, but that's expected. You pay for what you get and what you get is lovely. I just wish the portions were a bit bigger!   Parking right across the street, very accessible.  Will definitely come back one day when I find a boyfriend and we decided to splurge on our anniversary or something."}
{"text":"Coming in on a Wednesday night, I didn't expect this place to be as packed as it was. Fortunately by being alone, the staff was able to get me seated at a 2-top despite the numerous reservations in queue. Awesome!  I came to this dark and lavish restaurant per a recommendation from a friend back home, and I'm so glad I traveled out here to try. The environment, super-professional staff, and exquisite cuisine really made my day in Toronto extra special.  Started off with \"My Favorite Ex Girlfriend\" as my cocktail of choice. It was sweet and refreshing, with that alcohol-induced burn finish, reminiscent of your last breakup. At $16CAD I had apprehensions, but after trying it, I was quite satisfied.  I ordered the 1/4 Octopus, but decided to start with the Jamon Croquetas per recommendation from my waiter. I had no idea what to expect. Out came two little crispy morsels about egg size. There was a rich creamy sauce, with onion, but I didn't taste much ham? Or maybe there was a bunch of ham in there? OK, I'll be honest, I practically swallowed them whole. It was delicious. Don't judge me.  Finally came my Quarter Octopus. WOW. I kept staring at it. I didn't want to eat it because it LOOKED SO GOOD. And after 10 photos and 5 minutes of staring I finally gave in. The chorizo sausage tucked into the dish had that perfect natural smokiness with a meaty homemade texture, and not that chewy, store-bought casing you would have to masticate for a couple minutes. It was really spicy, just the way I love it! The octopus itself was grilled to perfection, and did not have a rubbery texture; just just meaty goodness from the sea. I was in meat heaven! The sauce in the dish had a lightly tart, spicy and herbal flavor but not powerful enough to interfere with the natural flavor from the octopus and sausage. It was absolutely delightful.  I'm in love with Bar Isabel. I need to come back and eat. If I ever apply for citizenship to Canada, this place will be my justification."}
{"text":"Where does the hype come from?  Amazing: Basque cake with sherry sauce Very good: Sardine on baguette  Mediocre: Wild mushroom - average stirfry Cheese and meat starter - no better than Terroni Patatas - average  Spanish sole - overcooked Octopus - good but overpriced  Surprised that bread, which wasn't even special, also cost 4$. Otherwise, service was good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Bar Isabel.   They have knowledgeable, welcoming, and friendly staff. A the cozy, romantically candle-lit interior with just enough spacing between tables to feel comfortable but not super close or spaced super far apart (the white linen places that do this make me feel so awkward, like they think diners are so fat they need lots of extra personal space).  And the food?  Oh, the food...  Let me break it down in some Fifty Shades of Food-porn style based on my meal tonight.  Blistered Shisito Peppers:  A heaping handful or two, these finger-length peppers are usually on the mild end but has the occasional random spicy one.  I think the ratio of non-spicy to spicy is something like 1:7.  Simply served grilled with a smatter of Maldonado sea salt flakes on top, the random chance of getting a scorching-hot one is part of the fun.   Garlic Butter Grilled Spot Prawns (BC), Special of the Day:  I can wax poetic about these all day!  So perfectly seared with a garlic-scented brown butter, these prawns were grilled to perfection.  The head/tomalley perfectly set, filled to the brim with umami mouthfeel and taste. A fresh and briney spray of the ocean, mixed with the creamy, soft custard-like texture of the tiny tomalley on your tongue.  The flesh, simultaneously yielding and gently resisting bite, was so perfectly between that 30-or so seconds between undercooked and overcooked firmness that I can't help but wonder how they knew exactly when to stop the heat.  Even the tiny meat morsel extracted from the rostrum (which I lovingly call it's \"spikey nose\" or \"shrimp-icorn horn\") is somehow cooked yet not overcooked. It's as if they even somehow timed that too.  This plate was the winner of the night - if not for the steep $30 price tag, I would've ordered another several rounds!   By the way, smartly served after the spicy shishito peppers I had just downed, the butter was much appreciated by my mouth which had been mildly on fire.   Hand Cut Botifarra, Cider Glaze & Oregano: A pork sausage cut into 6 round slices and served with toothpicks, the cider glaze was a lovely contrast.   Smoked Sweetbreads, Raw Tuna, Pickled Green Tomatoes & Brown Butter: The rich sweetbreads (thymus glands of a calf, just consider it a fluffy \"beef\" if it makes you squeamish) were further enhanced with the nutty brown butter.  I think tonight they were served with thin sheet shreds of pickled fennel, cutting through all those fatty layers.    Seared Foie Gras, Morcilla & Apple Mostarda: Two fat lobes of foie gras, scored and so deliciously seared on both sides while being absolutely plump and just cooked on the inside.  Amazing.  The kitchen must've turned up their skillets to an incredibly high heat to get the amazing crust on these for a flash sear to keep them still so thick.  Found one tiny vein that ran through, but otherwise pure delicious decadence.  I have to admit, I wasn't so much a fan of the iron-minerality of the morcilla (a blood cake), but I also want to vomit at the slightest whiff of blood so I am not a good judge of this.  Also, I would make a really horrible vampire.  It was fine eaten with the very mustard-heavy apples, but I passed this dish to the hubs as he's more of a carnivore than I am.   I love that the chef seems to have given a lot of thought to each component of the dishes toward balance without being fussy.  The kitchen staff must have a lot of experience or training to have each moving part of the dishes done right.  The techniques seem simple enough (as in no molecular gastronomy in sight) but the dishes taste of depth.  My one word summary of this very long review: YUM."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this restaurant for years. Bar Isabel is definitely worth every good review. We did the tasting menu and it included nine plates of yummy goodness. The food was amazing and the staff were incredibly friendly. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is usually busy and I can see why! The cocktails are truly amazing. Came here with a friend and we loved it. We haven't tried the food yet but will come back and later review them."}
{"text":"Very good vibe and great food. Good homage to Barcelona. I wouldn't say it is fine dining but it is a perfectly good choice for a nice evening out"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant. Excellent service, top notch cocktails and wine, and perfectly executed, creative food. Expensive, but doesn't break the bank."}
{"text":"**3.5**  Much ado about nothing. Mr. H had been trying to get a reservation here since the beginning of this year, so we finally ended up going this June for his birthday.   The only other tapas place I had been to was Carmen's and I absolutely loved that place, so naturally as soon as I entered I started comparing it in my head. The ambiance wasn't as lively or fun but that could be because it was a Sunday and it was raining. The menu stated the names of the dishes but gave no further description, not a problem if your server can do that for you. I asked our server about the difference between the Patatas Bravas Superior vs. Imperial and he left me very confused. He said it had jalapeño and blood sausage or artichoke. So what's the difference? Anyway, I didn't want the sausage or artichoke but yes I wanted the jalapeño. When the dish arrived it didn't have enough sauce which made it dry and it was topped with spring onions, no jalapeño.   Next came the Shisito Peppers which was just oily peppers with sea salt (yelp reviewers totally hyped that up for me), quite the disappointment. Then came the ceviche which was really good except for the fact that I had seem pictures on yelp and loved the presentation with the whole fish and mine can without it.  The next item on our list was the half grilled octopus and the smoked sweetbread with albacore tuna. We waited for 45 minutes for these two and the sweetbread with albacore tuna was absolutely worth the wait! It was my most favourite dish of the night, the octopus was slightly overcooked but the dressing was good. I definitely prefer the octopus at Carmen's.   In between this we had really delicious cocktails which is the main reason for my rating, along with the tuna dish.   Overall, I might come back for drinks but I'll stick to Carmen Cocina for tapas. Their menu has more variety and their patatas bravas is delicious!"}
{"text":"The octopus was lovely but a bit chewy. Some people like that so I can still understand the hype for the most part, but it could have been a bit more tender. The flavor profile of all the dishes was intriguing, though although some garnishes (like the one on the ceviche) didn't add to the dish. And the cocktails were fantastic, especially if you enjoy bitters. The noise level was crazy, though. Maybe they could consider adding some curtains, carpets or some other padding to absorb the volume; at one point we were screaming at each other from across a small table just to be heard. Overall, a nice experience with good food and drink. A solid 3.5. Where they lost points: noise level, food was good but not mind-blowing, seemed like minimal effort was put into decorating, and the neighborhood (although not something the restaurant can do much about) is really deteriorating."}
{"text":"A year ago this place would have gotten 5 stars from me! I was pleased with service and the food was amazing.  Last week? Absolutely not. Customer service seemed to come to a halt after being greeted by the host and brought to a table. Finding a table for us on a Saturday night, without a reservation was so easy!  I can't say enough about the food here, and I will never stop recommending this place to others. We started with olives and the bread and tomato and they were both so flavourful. The dry aged steak was great, and I absolutely loved the razor clams! I would have ordered another portion had I known how delicious they were. And you definitely shouldn't skip the octopus here, I have it every time and I feel like it's always cooked to perfection! Lastly my absolute favourite thing on the menu is the sherry basque cake, don't go here without trying it!!  I do wish however that my waiter didn't seem to be genuinely annoyed about being there. Asking for recommendations was not helpful, and he wasn't personable at all. I was kind of put off and didn't feel comfortable asking him too many questions as to not bother him.   I'll be back for the food but hope I don't get this waiter."}
{"text":"Dinner   Ambience: 4/5    Food: 3.5/5  Service: 4/5 (Friendly) Value: 3/5  Repeat: Not in a hurry. Really wanted to like this place. For what it is worth, some of my friends do love this place."}
{"text":"Amazing meal and absolutely delicious tapas! I came with a group of colleagues for a company dinner and ordered the tasting menu.  Everything was so good... My only regret is not knowing what was on the menu so that I wasn't able to pace myself accurately for eating! By the time I was finished, I was able to roll myself home.  We started off with grilled shishito peppers, olives, and marcona almonds. The peppers were soft but so flavourful.   Next came a variety of cured meats and protein. There was the whitetail carpaccio with a dollop of blue cheese in the centre. There was also some jamon cured for four years, some chorizo, and some cheese (forgot the type). The jamon had a generous streak of fat, which really brought out the pork flavour. The chorizo, however, was heavenly. Absolutely excellent charcuterie! The dishes came with a side of bread, along with some very rich olive oil and salt for dipping. Everyone loved the bread, and we all had a bit too much...  The whole fish ceviche came next. I believe it was a red snapper, and it was served with cucumbers marinated in a citrusy mayo-like sauce. I loved the tangy taste and stuffed myself with this dish. The fish was also perfectly fried - the collar was a beautiful crisp!   Then came the sweetbreads and raw tuna. Having never eaten sweetbread before, I was surprised to learn that this is the veal thymus gland. It was breaded beautifully and fried, and was super juicy on the inside. The pickled vegetables added a pop of flavour and complemented the sweetbread perfectly. The raw tuna also provided a nice balance and soft cushion to the crisp sweetbread.  By this time, I was getting full... But then! Then the foie gras was served. Chilled and grated foie gras was plated on top of sweet vegetables (forgot the type) and laid over the house made baguette. I am not kidding - the foie gras melted at the slightest touch! It was like eating a buttery, fluffy cloud. My lips were coated in natural glossy shine afterwards...  Patatas bravas were served after, but I regret to say that I was so full by this time that I couldn't eat any. It smelled heavenly though.   Stir fried garlic snow pea leaves mixed with mint and cilantro came soon, and I had so much of this! It was delightful, and reminded me slightly of the Chinese stir fried snow pea leaves. I was particularly fond of the salty parmesan cheese bits mixed in, as they really highlighted the flavour. There were also clams with house made tomato sauce, served with stir fried beans and salted cod. I loved the salted cod! It was fatty, but the tangy and sweet tomato sauce provided the perfect balance. I found that the flavour of the clams fell flat though.  At this point, I was already stuffed. But... The whole octopus, one pound king crab legs, and ribeye were all served at once. I wasn't mad about the king crab legs; though meaty, the sauce was a little too much and overbearing. The steak was SO good. It was a little chewy and tough, but the flavour was on point. It was perfectly medium rare, and the crisp and sear on the outside was impeccable. The octopus, however, was my favourite hands down. I had a whole leg, and it was crispy with a slight grilled char. You could literally taste the fire charcoal taste from the octopus. Despite being so full, I just had to go for seconds.  Finally, we finished with two desserts. Something similar to an apple crumble arrived - I believe it was poached pears with goat cheese. Not a fan of the salty cheese, but the fruit and crumble was delightful. There was also Basque cake with sherry cream... Though rich, it was creamy and warming.  We had the sommelier choose the wine for us, and they chose the medium boded red, a Gonzalez-Byass, Finca Moncloa, 2012. It was velvety and smooth, and went down so easily. There was a distinct taste of oak and something richer, though I'm not quite an expert to place my finger on what it was. Really good!"}
{"text":"Greag service, very professional. As soon as I told our first waiter I had a garlic intolerance, he informed all the staff and the one who took our order already knew. And the one who served our plate as well. I was really impressed. Apart from service, cocktails and food were great, especially the bone marrow and chicken. Yummy! Great place to try!"}
{"text":"I'd really love to give this place 4 stars but I just can't. The food and ambiance were great. The sommelier was very knowledgeable, and recommended a fantastic bottle that was everything I was looking for.   My beef was with the service. Our server in particular. He gave us a lot of attitude and came by 6-7 times to try to take away one of our dishes that we were clearly not done with. The first time, it was not even half eaten and when we said we weren't done with it, he gave a half eye roll and gave us a snarky \"really?\" Another time asking me as I was chewing food he had watched me put in my mouth if we were done with it. Apparently it became some sort of joke for him and the wait staff because after he came by and specifically asked if he could take away that one dish 6-7 times, he had his server friends come by to ask if they could take it away. Not cool. We even watched them gathering around together to discuss this after each attempt at collecting our plate.   Like I said, the food was good but there are plenty of other restaurants with the same level or better food but with much friendlier and more professional service. I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"GREAT SPANISH FOOD OUTSIDE OF SPAIN.  What a treat!  We planned on having dinner at Cava, but due to some unfortunate flooding our reservation was cancelled as we walked in the door.  The Cava staff was amazing helpful by getting us 2 bar seats at Bar Isabel and sending us via Uber (thank you so much Cava!!)  We had several fantastic dishes!  The sobrasada & foie gras, sweetbreads and raw tuna, and the basque cake and sherry cream were \"moment of silence\" worthy.  We had several other very enjoyable and authentic spanish tapas.  The staff was very knowledgeable and had many excellent suggestions for sherry, brandy and dishes.  They were also very attentive.  What a wonderful anniversary celebration.  . .with a bit of adventure!"}
{"text":"perfect place to go for a delicious meal with lots of selection! we both chose to let the waiter decide on the dish for us, and every dish was amazing. we had grilled octipus, calamari, meatballs, tuna ceviche and ox tail. we also had some really cool cocktails that wowed even my bartender friend!"}
{"text":"If we had Michelin star restaurants in Toronto, Bar Isabel would be on that list.  We waited a month for our weekend reservation and it was well worth the wait.  The drinks are very good, nice mixes and good amounts of alcohol.  The service is impeccable and they are extremely friendly and helpful.  The food.  Wow where to start.  First off, as a party of 2, we ordered WAY too much but we wanted to try it all.  Stand out highly memorable dishes were the gooseneck barnacles, chickpeas and the grilled Octopus.  My husband said the bone marrow was okay but he was t thrilled (I don't eat it) but the other good gives Bar Isabel a solid rating.  Wish they had a patio!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite on the recommendation of a friend. Was quite disappointing. We only ordered three dishes. One was above average (a salad), one was average (the octopus) and one was below average (bone marrow)."}
{"text":"Where to begin... The bar staff was great, very attentive and able to make recommendations based on our varied tastes and requests. I rarely eat seafood (I know, I know), so the bacalao was my first, and I loved it. We also really enjoyed the perfectly balanced foie gras and morcilla and were pleasantly surprised by the fresh scallop dish. Great flavor there, guys! The food delivery was also quite timely, so we weren't rushed. Many of the drinks were on the sweet side, though, so we were introduced to the old pal, my new favorite. Ambiance and music definitely rounded the place out, we stayed for awhile. Bar Isabel was a highlight of our weekend in TO."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night not knowing what to expect but was pleasantly surprised with how busy it was and what great vibes the restaurant had.   There were two of us and we were seated at the bar. I'm not usually a fan of eating dinner at the bar but it worked so perfectly this time and definitely added to our dining experience.   We ordered the quarter octopus, crispy pig ears (in a tortilla) and bread with cheese. This was the perfect amount for two people. I'm not usually a fan of octopus but this was hands down the best octopus I ever had. The crispy pig ears was also delicious, such innovative food and very well done.   The best part about my experience was the sommelier. We spoke with him for a good amount of time and he really listened to what we wanted in a bottle of wine. This is the first time the recommendation from a sommelier hit the nail on the head for exactly what we wanted in a bottle.   Overall, great experience and couldn't have anything better to say!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Food was phenomenal.  Will definitely go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"As if I expected anything different from the founder of http://www.yelp.ca/biz/black-hoof-toronto , Grant Van Gameron!  Great food, amazing service and open till 2am.  I now am torn between 416snackbar and Bar Isabel for the best late night eats and drinks.  This will be the next spot to look out for.  Located in Little Italy, it is a kitchy space perfect for just drinks or to indulge your self in a a giant 6 pound grilled octopus.  They have this Hibiscus beer called Dieu du Ciel, Rosee D'Hibiscus, Belgian Wit.  I had it at http://www.yelp.ca/biz/jabistro-toronto first and it is the perfect food pairing or simply to sip away on.   Their draught selection is awesome and their cocktails are also killer.  The service here is insanely high level and quality.  It has a very hipster vibe, which typically indicates a we don't care type of service offering, however here it is top quality service.  Servers are attentive, personable and exude care.  I went with my daughter who they spoke with many times to see if \"SHE\" was ok, made jokes and served here dishes and asked if she \"wanted\" to share them with me.  Top quality service, not found often in this city.  We ordered 6 dishes at once and the server \"offered\" an order to serve the dishes so they do not all come at once.  This was a nice touch.  The food?  Ah, the food.  Duck egg, chorizo pork fat hollandaise.  Yup, no butter, just pork fat.    Mixed charcut of Buffalo Slinzega, Iberico Salchichon, cappicola (daughter's fav), Hogtown charcuterie smokey goodness, Bresoala, lonza (loin) all served with some of the best bread in the city.  Bread where the crust is the star.  Like a crispy, chewy treat!  Next up spicy horse tartare.  The meat was bright and fresh, better then beef in my opinion for that reason and resembled the highest quality Toro (tuna) cut.  All topped with a spicy alioli.  Daughter liked this before she found out it was horse.  Does that make me a bad person?   Then a tongue sandwich which was huge and loved the portion.  Warm ,thin sliced tongue, in some bad azz bread.  But wait there is more.  A hipster style place, plaid everywhere and the presence of take-out containers?  This is true and it happened and there is no lies about it.  I took out my tongue sandwich.  I talked to Grant who advised to bring it home, add cheese and turn it into a grilled cheese.  Ah, yeah, done and done in the morning.  Oh damn, the bone marrow.  It is what it is.  Bone Marrow!  Huge long bone, roasted to perfection, served with toasted buttered bread and a small perfectly sized spoon to be able to get every bit of the marrow goodness.  Table dressed with a bowl of coarse salt to garnish your marrow which comes out slightly red inside and placed on the bread.  You then close your eyes, and wish you were no where else and would never leave.  Yeah it is that good. SO anyway, I am back and you should go and never go anywhere else :)"}
{"text":"The drinks and food are all equally delicious. The octopus is amazing and should be ordered at every table. Yes, the meal can kind of break the bank but I kind of see the place as a special occasion place rather than an every day place. The service was great and even though we slipped in between reservations they never rushed us or asked us to leave when our time was up since food service was a bit slow."}
{"text":"A group of four of us went to Bar Isabel last week. We partook in a tasting menu, which was amazing and fairly affordable given the amount of food we ate ($50.00/person). We all left glowing and feeling spoiled. Thanks for the amazing night!"}
{"text":"Since opening this tapa restaurant on College street in Toronto, it has been a personal favourite! From the atmosphere and space to the fresh menu and incredible plate, Bar Isabel is arguable the best tapa restaurant in Toronto!  They have an incredible meat and cheese plate that accompanies beautifully prepared cocktails to start the dinner. Followed by fresh tapa plates that will provide you mouth watering memories to go along with a wonderful wine menu.   It is and will continue to be a constant on my top 5 in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel was quite the disappointment.  Between two of us, we ordered four dishes to try a bit of lots of things.   At the end of the night,  there's not one dish that we'd go back for.  The cold meats platter wasn't bad, though I feel that Spanish cured meats don't work as well for that kind of dish (as Italian would).  From the main dishes, the sweetbreads with tuna was by far the best.   The octopus was nothing special, and the lentil with mushrooms dish was a combo of things that didn't really add much to each other.   I think they've likely changed their menu recently cause some of the dishes I saw in yelp pics didn't look like they were on the menu. Regarding service, we were seated at the bar so we were helped by both the bartender and a server from the floor.  The bartender was very friendly and helpful.   The other server was very cold and barely talked to us other than to scribble down our orders.   Very confusing when it came time to tip.  Edit: almost forgot one key detail: the pacing on bringing out our food.  The first two dishes came out one after the other in the first 15 minutes.  Then we had a 45 minute gap before we got the last two dishes together.  Added to the overall frustration of the evening.  We were there celebrating a birthday, but the combination of the disappointing food and cold service made us skip dessert."}
{"text":"Had to come back just to confirm my initial impression -- the food here is very average and simply over-hyped. I ordered almost the entire menu over my two visits and unfortunately left disappointed both times. For example, the ceviche was far too acidic and had a very unappetizing, 'mushy' texture, the patatas bravas were dry and the accompanying sauce was unauthentic, and the steak lacked seasoning and proper execution."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! Came for my birthday and was amazing. Food was all on point and waiter was very helpful on decisions on what to order. Even recommended we take out a few dishes because we over ordered!  Highlights include the jamon tasting. If you like prosciutto then you'll love this as you get both types of cured ham to compare & contrast. Octopus because it's what everyone gets!   Best dish was the basque cake with Sherry. So good even my boyfriend who generally doesn't have a sweet tooth loved it!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel. Lives up to the gossip.  The venue is cozy and hipster chic but not in an annoying way. It's as authentic as the colourful servers who are, much like the restaurant, unrefined but classy. They're also knowledgeable and efficient. Our server paid just the right amount of attention to us and made some great recommendations.  Three of us shared a fantastic array of tapas, but I would say there were two must eat standouts: the sea bream ceviche and the grilled octopus. Perfectly executed so you are fully satisfied from first to last bite.  We started with a trio off the to begin menu. I wish I could remember what it was, but all I remember was the creamy foie gras crunchy crostini magic in my mouth:  Considering I don't like vegetables as much as a grown responsible adult should, I loved these shishito peppers. We almost fought over them...almost. Salty simple bites.  Sweetbreads and fresh tuna - I didn't know how well this would work and let me tell you it worked - on every level. Flavour, texture and money well spent.  Let's end with the two best dishes I mentioned earlier. The whole sea bream ceviche is exactly what you'd want. The presentation was a celebration of the sea: a bed of fresh meaty ceviche surrounded with creamy avocado atop the rest of the fish perfectly fried from head to tail. We demolished the entire plate, right down to the deep fried leeks - ingenious addition.  If you can take something away from Bar Isabel, it's the fact they merge technique with flavour to bring dishes that showcase every ingredient. That is an art - it's for people who just love good food.  The pièce de résistance is the grilled octopus. If you need to know anything about octopus it should be this - it is really DIFFICULT to cook perfectly. Perfect means tender and this was: Perfect ending to a spectacular night. This meal actually sums up my entire trip out east - as good as it gets, until next time..."}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my Mrs. Didn't have a clue what anything on the menu said so asked our server, to which he replied \"do you trust me?\".  I thought...no not really, I've just met you but I went with it. Told him what I wasn't keen on and he said \"easy\".  Everything he brought out was amazing. Everything. Especially the Black Pudding topped with Pan Seared Foie Gras. Probably the greatest thing that's ever been on my tongue.  Decently priced too.  Well done man."}
{"text":"Mind blowingly delicious! Such a fun casual vibe with \"uh muh guh this is so freakin good\" food. True cheffery. I live in LA and we have nothing like this- so wish we did. GO!"}
{"text":"Spectacular food and drinks. Love the vibe. Everything was exquisite. Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Sobrasada and foie gras was effing amazing. Everything was great, but that was especially good. Service was helpful. Great place for a group dinner."}
{"text":"It was pretty interesting in terms of the meals.  A bit pricey for what they are offering in my opinion, but then the cocktails were amazing.  I was iffy with the rare pork but then it did taste pretty good, didn't get sick afterwards so now I can say it was good lol...  Very loud environment so don't expect to go for a quiet ambient sort of dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!! A friend and I went in and silly us forgot to make a reservation. Make a reservation, they are busy and packed!!!  We sat at the bar and had an amazing time. The bar tender was great and recommended the white sangria, delicious !!! We then ordered some tapas. They flavours were exploding in my mouth and I wanted more. Ambiance is very romantic and creative. I would def go again!!! I'll post pics of what I ordered, don't recall the names. It is pricey but def worth the experience and food!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent delicious awesome food and good vibes all around. I had the ceviche, bone marrow, octopus chorizo thing and the foie gras dessert. I would say that the ceviche and the bone marrow were EXCEPTIONAL and would go back just to have those two again.  The service was good, prompt, friendly and professional without being too casual or stuffy.  Definitely one of my new favourites."}
{"text":"Five stars! Period.  Ok a little more on this fantastic place. By now you have read a little bit about this place, so you have general idea of what this place is all about. Is it the French Laundry over the top tasting menu with perfect this and that? No. And nor should it be. What it is is the perfectly approachable spot that doesn't know the word pretentious, but knows very well how to put things together for a great experience. Things like the awesome people who make it what it is, all super friendly and passionate about what they do. The food: fantastic! Tapas yes, but there's nothing typical about their food. So many great choices, you can't go wrong. One (ok two!) of my favorites, both foie gras options. Try them if you're into foie. Try the desserts too! And of course the cocktails... Really so good, so well balanced. One of my friends trusts the bartender so much that he never orders off the cocktail menu, and goes for dealers choice. Not only has he not been disappointed, he's loved every drink. (Mind you, I wouldn't suggest this approach if you're not that adventurous, but if you weren't somewhat adventurous, this place might not be your cup of tea). Cheers."}
{"text":"I can not speak highly enough for the food and atmosphere of this amazingly curated restaurant. The Ontario perch, fried chicken, king crab are all stunning dishes. I am very happy to have this fantastic addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow... Believe the hype. It's that good.  I'd heard the reviews but the menu never really jumped out at me.  That coupled with the fact it's hard to get a table kept me away longer than it should have.  What a fantastic place.  The service, the vibe, the drinks were all amazing but the real star of the show was the food.  We were a table of four and did the tasting menu.  You can set your price point so we did $60 per person.  What came next was one of the best meals of my life.  I can't recommend doing this enough.  It ended up being more dishes than I thought there would be so you get to sample quite a bit and I think it ends up being a better deal.  Too many to describe and too hard to pick favourites so just get it.  Simply wonderful."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: awesome.  Service: really awesome (as in, the server was a major hottie and if you're reading this, message me).  Drinks were just okay - I wasn't enamoured with the heavy-gin influence of the cocktail menu (let's just say gin and I had a bad experience once).  The fried chicken and crispy eggplant was THE BEST THING EVER.  Id go back for that dish for sure.  Other standouts include crab legs (I don't usually like crab, but they were pretty good - best part was when the waiter encourage me it's better if I just \"stick my finger right in there\"...) and the devilled eggs with blood sausage.  My first foray into blood sausage and I liked it!   I wanted to get the horse, I admit it, but my dining companion was all, \"NO\".  So maybe next time.  It's like the poor man's Black Hoof - no line up, no one tweeting that I'm a douche!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is really a hidden gem  They are a Spanish tapas style restaurant and really nailed the Spanish atmosphere. The place itself is such a enjoyable place to have a nice meal with good company. I only been here once so I didn't get much of a chance to explore the menu however from what I tried, the food is amazing. Some of the menu items in my opinion were on the pricey side.   They have a good bar, great selection of wine and cocktails. They have great service and all servers were attentive and seemed well educated on the menu.  The grilled octopus (full $65/half $39) was tender and full of flavour, they have great fresh chimicurri however I found the roasted bone marrow (16) could have been a little more elevated in flavour. We also ordered the grilled mussels in red garlic sauce (14) packed with garlic and chips & boquerones ($9) and patatas bravas (9) also very good   I would go back, it was so refreshing to have something less common to feast on!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I came here with friends and found the meat tapas to be severely overpriced. Any of the meat tapas start at around $50.00.  I'm referring to steak, octopus, muscles, fish and so forth. I found this a bit high for tapas. Tapas are supposed to be smaller dishes so you can try more.  I was also disappointed because this restaurant advertises themself as being an authentic Spanish Tapas Restaurant (however, currently their web site is down; maybe they are fixing this). I did not find this restaurant to be authentic of Spanish food.   I grew up in Central America and know what authentic Spanish tapas should be like. I would say this restaurant is more modern with tapas inspired from Italy and other European countries.   I honestly would not go back to this restaurant. It was severely overpriced and I had been to another tapas restaurant on King Street the night before and it knocked this restaurant out of the water. I would highly recommend you try Patria Restaurant before coming here.  If you are splitting the check with other people, make sure the waiter does it correctly. Our waiter added an extra $10.00 to everyone's bill in hopes of receiving a bigger tip. We noticed this and asked the hostess to please reverse this. The waiter then tried to say how he made a simple mathematical mistake. I honestly wouldn't keep a waiter who does this to my customers around at a restaurant like this."}
{"text":"I need to start off by saying that I would have given Bar Isabel 5 stars, but for two things: The price tag for the small portions and the octopus, which I didn't dislike, but I wasn't bowled over. It was a little gritty in places and although well flavoured, I feel that it would be a better value to fill up on more of the small nibbly tapas than to jump into the waters of octopus-land. Everything else was top notch, so they're getting a 4.5  We began with a bottle of Cava to celebrate my friend's birthday and paired it with some warm spiced olives, crunchy marcona almonds and cheese. These were the perfect starters. My friend loved the sourdough bread, but I didn't try it. After this we  couldn't decide what to order because she doesn't like foie gras, organ meats or uncooked fish and this is pretty much all I eat. Our server was great and took this under advisement, suggesting that he would just let the kitchen decide. we were pleased with this option.  A lovely marinated sardine arrived on a crostini and it was really good. I'm not always a fan of sardines, but the flavours popped. The Iberico ham croquette was amazing and crunchy on the outside with lots of oozy cheese in the middle. Warm lentils and mushrooms were lemony and delicious-- I would not have ordered this dish on my own, but I enjoyed it. The razor clams, served simply in their shell, were tender and garlicky. I had the smoked sweetbread and tuna crudo. This was probably one of my favourite dishes because of the balance of textures and flavours and if sweetbreads are on the menu-- Jenny is there.  Now for the octopus. Hmm... It was impressive looking and tasty, but the texture was a bit rubbery and every time I've eaten it or cooked it myself the suction-y bits have been taken off, or I have pulled them off after poaching. I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan. It wasn't bad, but as I mentioned earlier, for a signature main, and at that price? Nope. Didn't love it.  Service was perfect. Attentive, always filling water, checking on drinks and no hipster snootiness. I'll confess that I expected a bit of that--although this places has been described as 'hipster', I feel that it's a little out of the hipster price range and there are no burgers, gourmet hotdogs or mac n cheese on the menu. I'm convinced that the absence of these items keeps the hipsters away like fly spray. Which I love because they really are about as charming and unique as flies.  I would enjoy a meal here again. I say 'enjoy' and not 'eat' because I think Bar Isabel's philosophy is not just about the act of eating, but primarily the enjoyment of it and this matches well with my philosophy on life."}
{"text":"I believe that service is as equally important as the quality of food, and is a vital component to a well-rounded and memorable dining experience. Bar Isabel has top notch food - delicious plates for sharing that are full of flavour, creative, and leaves you wanting more.    On the other hand, if you are looking for a place to dine comfortably where you can feel like a free agent to order whatever that pleases you on the menu - then this isn't the place for you. Our server, right as we sat down, was trying hard to up-sell us on food and drinks, despite the fact that we were clearly waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. There were subtle arrogant tones from when we refused the tasting menu, and judgement when asking for clarification about the prices of the specials for the evening. Never have I felt so inferior as a paying customer, as though I wasn't good enough to be at this restaurant. Disappointed, I left a mediocre tip and predictably, our server let us leave without a thank you for coming or even a goodbye. (Come on, at least pretend to try.)   Would I return to Bar Isabel? Likely not. It's unfortunate because I really enjoyed the food, but I think I would rather eat good food at a place where I felt like I was welcomed."}
{"text":"Walked in around 9pm on a Tuesday and was seated immediately.  Service was quick and friendly.  The ambiance is great and has a very spanish feel to it.  I tried one of their beers on tap recommended by the waitress - shawinigan handshake.  It's a 7% that has a mild hoppiness to it and went great with my meal.  We had the chips/jalapenos and horse tartare to start.  I thought the tartare was very decadent but the chips a little boring... my date thought the opposite.   The fried chicken was delicious and juicy and the buttermilk dip was a great compliment.  We also had a stewed tripe w/ chorizo which is highly recommended if you can stomach tripe (no pun intended!).  Be sure to get an order of the sourdough bread to nibble on throughout the night as well.  My only gripe is one of the waiters took our chips away before they were finished."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is quite nice but the food is quite limited. The have a small 1 page menu and the food was okay. Nothing really special especially for the price. I do like how they have Nathan options but nothing was super amazing. The service was great! The server was very attentive by I think this place is overhyped."}
{"text":"Decided to try this much hyped place.  Horse tartar - tasteless and bland. Definitely can use more herbs, seasoning and thoughts to dress it.  Tripe stew - tripe was tender, but the stew can benefit with more cooking time as it was quite thin and rather tasteless.  Fried chicken - fried chicken is fried chicken. If it's freshly fried, it's always good. As my companion said, fresh Popeyes chicken is just as good. Eggplant was a nice side dish but the greens were too sweet. Perhaps they were trying to do a sweet and savory contrast, but not quite hit the note.  Spanish blood sausage - almost a shame to be called spanish blood sausage because the worst blood sausage in Spain is better than this tube-liked substance. The fried thyme and onions were nice though.  Glad we started with 4 dishes and didn't try more as it would be waste of more money. Yes, we didn't try their famous octopus dish, but didn't seem all that good on the next table. Besides, we probably would have been disappointed if we did.  Service and vibe were decent."}
{"text":"Cool jazz music, food is very decent if you like an experimental menu (I do)"}
{"text":"Food was delicious but pricy. Service was ok. It's a nice date restaurant and the bartender is pretty good at making cocktails."}
{"text":"Unreal. Best restaurant in Toronto in my opinion. Expect to wait at least an hour if you don't have a reservation. My favourite dishes are the Basque cake, grilled octopus, oysters, charcuterie, chorizo and grilled leeks."}
{"text":"A recommended way to experience Bar Isabel: stumble on in here for a very late night meal. The kitchen is open until 2 am, 7 days a week and so why not take advantage of this fact? After a night out, you can go in with a couple of people sans reservations and enjoy the late night buzz with some great eats. You can pretend you're in Spain, eating late as the Spaniards do or that you're on an episode of Vice's Munchies, enjoying bacchanalian escapades. Sit near the back, enjoy the moody lighting, atmosphere and play the song Hernando's Hideaway in your head while you enjoy fantastic plates, a glass of wine, and maybe a fast embrace."}
{"text":"There is a lot of hype around Bar Isabel,  but I was not disappointed. Located on College, a little further down from the strip and right across my favorite coffee spot Lit, Isabel is a cozy yet spacious tapas bar offering a taste of Spanish delicacies and familiar seafood plates. The lighting is perfect. We were not able to get a reservation, but upon arriving, we snatched one of the last tables near the bar. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.    In a traditional Spanish tapas bar, the plates come free with your glass of wine--but let's be serious. That concept would never work in North America; we were however, glad to invest in trying the following plates:  1. Bread: Warm sourdough bread, lightly toasted with olive oil 2. Manchego Cheese 3. Iberico Chorizo: Incredible 4. Patatas Bravas Supreme: Crunchy delicious potatoes. The supreme option comes with blood sausages toppled with sour creme and green chili peppers. The morcilla pieces were very velvety and smooth.  4. Whole bream ceviche: The whole sea bream ceviche is served on top of the body of the fish. It is mixed with avocado, which makes the fish less briny.   The cocktails are good, as they should be for $15 per drink. We finished our meal with a CRAZY corn ice cream and caramel brittle, which was delicious! I'm a huge fan of corn and this exceeded my expectations. Great spot!"}
{"text":"The short: well-executed food, attentive staff, fun atmosphere.   Devoured: cheese & meat platters, bone marrow, grilled octopus, Manila clams with chorizo, tongue on brioche. 10/10 would order again. Just more.   While not a transcendent food experience, Bar Isabel is a damn good one. Listen to the server's recommendations, choose from a well-stocked and priced beer and wine selection, be happy."}
{"text":"Place was packed so we sat at the bar. This was great because got to speak to the bar tenders.  Everyone was very attentive and gave great food suggestions. We came because we heard great things and I really wanted the octopus ..so good!!! Along with the chicken chorizo stew...bone marrow.  Everything was on point.  And the ambiance and music was great too! Although it's pricey  , the place didn't feel pretentious."}
{"text":"The décor had a lot of warm wood, tiled floors and mirrors on the wall. The ambiance was great. The place was busy for a Monday night. We were lucky that someone cancelled, as we didn't have reservations. If you do intend on going I would recommend getting a reservation.   I've been waiting to come here for a while and we finally came here for our anniversary dinner, and ordered the prix fixe chef selection menu for $65. We got to try 11 different dishes and were stuffed by the time we walked out. We told our server some things we wanted to try and the rest the chef choose for us. I think this is a good choice if you want to try a variety of dishes and are unsure of what to order as you get to try a variety of dishes. There were some dishes that were really good and others that I didn't like as much.  For drinks I got the lemon refresher. It had just the right balance of sweet and sour and it was refreshing.   Service 5/5: Service gets at A++ from me. It was some of the best service that I've had at a restaurant. Our server was helpful and friendly. The timing of the food was well orchestrated. There was no long lags in between the dishes. All the staff were friendly, attentive, and frequently came to check if everything was ok. Water was constantly refilled, and they even served us new plates, which I really appreciated! I find few restaurants do this, but it helps make the overall experience better.  Food: 4/5 To start we had the warmed olives and marcona almonds. The marcona almonds were delicious; they had a light buttery taste and are softer than regular almonds. The olives came in this oil marinade that made them delicious. I don't really like olives much, but these were good.  One of my favourite dishes was the Jamón, served on their house made sourdough bread. The ham was high quality; it had a deep rich pink colour and lovely fat marbling. It was tasty and the bread really complemented the ham. It was simple, just ham and bread, but really yummy.  I also enjoyed the jamon croquetas. They were served hot; outside was nice and crispy and the inside creamy and soft.  Sobrassada and Foie Gras was another good dish. The sweet jam underneath help cut through the creaminess of the foie gras, and the crunchy bread add another element to the dish.   I enjoyed the smoked sweetbreads and raw tuna. The sweetbread was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I liked the pickled onion, radish, and capers. The tuna was light and didn't overpower the sweetbread. Couldn't really taste a lot of the smokey flavour. I did like the balance of acidity in the dish.  The octopus meat was tender. But by itself I found it lacked flavour. All the taste came from the green and brown sauces it was served with.    The foie gras and morcilla was my least favourite dish. The blood sausage I found a bit mushy in the consistency. The sausage didn't have much flavour and the foie gras on top made the dish really greasy.   The tried the Manchego cheese and another type of goat cheese. I liked both of them. I also loved the bread and the olive oil it was served with as well.  Everyone raves about the roast bone marrow, but this wasn't one of my favourite dishes. I found it a bit too greasy, and with all the hype I was expecting more. I did like the green sauce that accompanied it, which helped cut through some of the oiliness.  Make sure to leave some room for dessert! The basque cake was really yummy. It is served warm and was the perfect way to end the meal. It was delicious and not overly sweet. The sherry cream perfectly matched the dish. This is one of those must have dishes.  Overall I enjoyed my experience here. I like the tapas style of food where you get to try many different small bites."}
{"text":"We found this place on line and they certainly delivered!   Very happy with the food and fun atmosphere.  The hostess was excellent and called personally to check if we were still en route and held our reservation.   Sommelier made a wonderful wine recommendation in our budget and we found that all the employees seemed happy to help and make our meal great.   Sat at the bar and met friendly people  Particularly enjoyed the octopus-tender and tasty and tried the basque cake and sherry cream - delicious  Thank you bar Isabel and great hostess who then very kindly gave us a wine bar recommendation  She went above and beyond to call again and give us directions.   Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I was here with a girl I hosted a week ago. It turned out she was a foodie as well and this place was on her list to check out!!  I can't remember the last time a restaurant in Toronto blew my mind and taste buds!! Every course just got better and better, tastier and tastier!!   This is what we had: Patatas Bravas, supreme-O version $12 - the potatoes were tasty because of the seasoning but I found the sausage bland.  Chorizo Verde & Octopus skewers $9 - both the sausage & octopus were tasty on their own but what a great flavor combination together!   Smoked sweetbreads, raw tuna, green tomato & Brown butter $18 - again, interesting flavours individually and together!! After I ate it my guest told me what sweetbreads really are!! Not bread!! Lol   Arbol Chili Chickpeas & snow pea leaves $6 - yum yum yum! Light seasoning of a dark mustard, lemon and garlic yet so refreshing!   Fried chicken w/ buttermilk sauce $13 - to die for!!! Honest to God I had to check if this chicken was undercooked because it was so moist!!! The best fried chicken I have EVER had!!! Absolutely LOVED it!! Buttermilk sauce was delicious!   Basque cake & sherry cream $8.5 - like a corn bread but amazingly delicious with the cream sherry which was poured on the cake by our server!!   Corn ice cream, burnt husk & walnut crumble, spicy caramel $6.5 - to die for!! Seriously best creation I've had in a while!! Orgasmic explosion in your mouth!!   At this point my taste buds and mind was blown!! In between one of our courses a server refilling our water spilt it all over us. Our main server Matt apologized while we were eating and I had totally forgotten about it because I was in foodie heaven!! I was like huh?! All the staff involved in presenting our food took the time to tell us about each dish.   Amazing food, service and atmosphere! I'm okay with the prices vs the quality of food!! But they need better lighting. Look how crappy my pics look!! Lol  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything I've had at Bar Isabel has been phenomenal. I've dined at the bar and also taken clients out here with the prix fixe menu, and all the dishes I didn't expect to like, I loved (bone marrow, octopus). Definitely a great spot!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel, you have found a fan in me. We went with a large party so we got the sampler menu - $50 each outside of tax, tip and drinks. Now, I can barely tell you what we had (the servers detailed every dish as it came out, but the place was so so loud I could barely hear a thing), but we gave the server some of our personal likes, dislikes and must-haves (for me it was the cured meat, and for one of my friends it was the crab legs) at the beginning of the meal and he took care of the rest. The service here is really excellent.   The dishes that really stood out to me were the spicy beef tartare & chicheron (heavenly), the octopus and the roast bone marrow. Normally, I'm not a marrow fan, but the delicious sour dough bread and zesty green sauce that came on the side balanced out the richness of the marrow so well that I would order it again. And the basque cake with sherry cream... save room for dessert because this is a showstopper.   I didn't like the mackerel (a special, I believe), but that's totally personal taste, as the rest of the table enjoyed it. The cured meat was tasty, but not the \"must-have\" I was hoping it to be.   So. Much. Food. came out of the kitchen for us. We were stuffed by the end of the meal and had an excellent time.   I feel like I have to mention that two people in our party are gluten-free, and the kitchen totally worked around that, providing alternatives for every dish that needed it. The girls said the GF bread was excellent, but the dessert left something to be desired.  There is so much more on the menu I'd like to try, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  The sherry wine is amazing!  I even bought the olive oil they served with the bread.  Will definitely visit next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible. First timers in Toronto, this restaurant recommendation came from a friend who visits often for work. We had a 9:15pm reservation on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  Began with a cocktail ( The Hopeless Mermaid) and is was perfect for a warm evening.    Now for the food.... This is very much a sharing menu, so we asked the waiter for some highlights and took his advice.  Here is what you cannot miss- Soppressata with shaved foie gras and honey Sea bream ceviche  Tomato salad with anchovies   What you could probably skip - Calamari   The atmosphere was lovely.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Wow... one of the best meals of 2015. That octopus was INCREDIBLE. The basque cake for dessert too, wow!!!! Delicious, great atmosphere. This would be 'the place' to go if you are visiting Toronto and looking for a truly amazing dining experience."}
{"text":"Consistently impressive in all aspects. Great food, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and impeccable cocktails mixed and stirred to perfection. DO NOT miss out on thew dessert.   The Food: designed to be shared: authentic and quality ingredients. Do not miss out on the pickled vegetables (YES, the pickles are unbelievably good), carpaccio, all cheeses -of course, bone marrow, the seasonal ceviche and the Octopus.   The Drinks: The Barragana with charred pineapple jalapeño infused tequila has just the right amount of kick before dinner. Follow that by a glass (or a bottle) of Tempranillo, or any of their great wine list selections.  The Dessert: THE BASQUE CAKE might by far be one of the best desserts you'll have anywhere in Toronto. Pairs nicely with a glass of the Gonzalez Byass Cristina sherry.   Great for intimate dinners, sharing, small groups, loud and buzzing, late night dinning. great Gluten Free options."}
{"text":"Talk about a gorgeous meal, and a wonderful dining experience to boot. We had a very late reservation on a Sunday evening, and even though I originally thought we could come in earlier and get a seat at the bar - the place was hopping. We took a long walk around the block and when on our way back, we were called to be seated.  Our waiter was amazing - he was attentive, knowledgeable and truly seemed to be enthused about our enjoyment of the food.  The meal we put together consisted of pickles, peppers and the absolutely delectable 1/2 an octopus. Rounded off with good wine, good conversations and superb service.  You Toronto folk are lucky."}
{"text":"What I liked: -Bone marrow (I appreciated being able to dress it with the amount of sea salt I wanted rather than having them pre-season it for me) -Pan Con Tomate (liked it garlicky) -Basque Cake (simple cake yet also unique and done just right) -Octopus (so soft, just like when I have it in Greece) -Sobrasaada and Foie Gras (melt in your mouth goodness!!! just wish the honey was toned down a bit as it overpowered the sausage) -Halibut ceviche with pig ears (if pig ears sound weird to you, just set that thought aside. it really wont taste \"weird\", it'll be like eating a crispy deep fried snack) -Iberico ham -Isabel fashioned 2.0 drink   What I wouldn't get again because it was \"just alright\": -snow pea leaves (I didn't like the lemon-y taste...too sour) -shishinos(sp?)...again, didnt love having a sour taste to peppers, although I love spicy so finding that one out of ten pepper that was hot was great -the Spanish cider (didnt like the smell or taste)  Overall, the service was great and the dishes were unique and tasty. It's a nice spot to catch up with friends to enjoy a nice meal with your mate (but a bigger group is better as its tapas style so you'll get to try more dishes with more people). I do tend to hate how expensive cocktails are these days (or at least in fancier restaurants)...a drink should be under $10."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this tapas restaurant. The octopus here is probably one of the best in the city, and the interior feels as if you are in an authentic Barcelona tapas bar. I always like to try one of their unique cocktails while waiting to be seated at this busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Warm welcome, had reservation, was busy enough for a weeknight. Food timing was excellent between dishes. Staff was very helpful w/ pairing. So why only 3 stars? Portions seemed small for cost, I mean kale isn't that expensive, pile it on! Food was really good, but not like mindblowing for the money. Just seems a little over rated, so grading on a 4 star scale."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always had a great experience with the food. This time we ordered the Sobrosada & foie gras, the fries, sea bass ceviche, bone marrow and the famous octopus (quarter size). I would say the highlights were definitely the sobrosada & foie gras, the ceviche and the bone marrow. The fries were a bit of mediocre and the octopus, thought tasty, not the best quality compared to what we had before here. It's a bit dry and the presentation (one tentacle on a few dandelion leaves) was just not that impressive.   Overall it's a great meal and I would definitely come back for more food here."}
{"text":"I guess you could say that if a restaurant is named after a narcissist then you have a customer for life. Every visit to Bar Isabel for me has been something of a religious experience - the food comes out in an organized coursed procession and is handsomely plated. I have come with 'chef friends', and they have all been impressed.  Menu standouts: Bone marrow, beet salad, fried chicken (late night menu), fried squid rib eye (duh) and the basque cake. This cake with sherry cream is what dead babies get to sleep on in heaven. FOH staff are knowledgeable in every aspect of service. Cocktails are beautifully crafted and being an extremely difficult person to make a drink for, i am always pleased when I order my juice-like rum sours. I have the utmost respect for the staff who can cook for such long hours and make consistently beautiful food, and to those who serve patrons politely for a million hours a night. Be nice to them."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks after dinner - really cute and unique interior. The place was incredibly packed on a Friday however, we arrived at 9pm and there was a table available until 10pm and they were happy to let us have a seat and drink until the 2-top arrived.   I've heard amazing things about this place and the food around us provided an mouth watering scent. I'm definitely looking forward to returning and enjoying food and drinks without feeling rushed."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We ordered the bass ceviche, bone marrow, potatoes, foie gras and octopus.    However the service was mediocre.  It initially was very good. And the server was helpful in offering us half portions of some of the options we chose. Then when it was time for desert our server told us if we wanted to order we would need to go to the bar. But there weren't any people waiting for our table. So wr definitely didnt appreciate that  Also, there were people standing right behind my friend while we were eating which made it both uncomfortable and difficult to hear the conversation."}
{"text":"The food here was excellent. Reminded me of my time in Spain and some was even better. But be prepared to spend quite a bit of money, it was not Spain prices.    It's loud and a bit dark in here but was really lively for a Sunday night. Great place for groups and catch up with friends. If you have dietary restrictions like not eating pork or avoiding gluten you might be really limited in your choices. They do ask if there are allergies and seem to accommodate but I'm not sure how.   Service was impeccable and servers were extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the food. Lots of drinks to choose from but $$.  Beer was around $9 and glasses of wine double digits. Lots of fun cocktails at $14.   Bread is $8 for a few slices. Might be better off getting a smoked meat or cheese plate that comes with bread instead.  Loved the Spicy calamari, and the bone marrow (which also came with 4pcs of bread). Patatas Bravas was excellent and what I believe it should be, I did not have one this good in spain. We also got a leek and ham baked dish which was good but small. If we did not fill up on bread we would have been starving. My DPs weren't adventurous enough to try the barnacles.    For dessert the Basque Cake is worth all the hype and a must. The leche frite was also pretty yummy."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Bar Isabel . They have th best sea bream ceviche and octopus ! All other dishes were ok . I am just shocked that the service was so poor! When the food came, the server didnt describe what it was , towards the end of the night, he managed to knock over a glass of water all over me and they didnt even comp anything .   I was very disappointed ! If you are looking for good spanish food - go to Cava ! Amazing service and food !"}
{"text":"Very intimate inside. Food was the best I've had in awhile. Anything you order will be delicious. My favorite was the soppresata toast. Would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best food I've ever had in Toronto. We ordered the scallops, bone marrow, half the octopus and the blood sausage with foie gras (in that order by the way, which was great because the foie gras is so rich so it should be saved for the end). I must admit I cannot remember the dessert we ordered (except that it was light) because we were so stuffed by then. I can't even pick a favourite because they're all equally great but in very different ways. I will say, however, that the octopus was very well cooked. Oftentimes it can be a little overcooked and feel kind of chewy, but this was soft and tender and so very flavourful.  The service was great, decor and atmosphere was wonderful, overall an excellent time. It is on the pricier side, but I think it's worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"a few bites from our full review -  \"We couldn't react in any other way but to stop and smile at the seating area by the front window - it seemed like a long thin armrest re-purposed as a thin table - there was something so charming and spontaneous about that.\" \"With a large selection of dishes available and our tummies growling, all we had to do was set a monetary limit per person. Our waiter politely asked us about allergies and preferences and we were impressed how very professional he was. \""}
{"text":"OMG SO delicious- the fried squid was freaking amazing, the dulche de lecha dessert was soo good- good quality, nice atmosphere, friendly service- awesome experience overall. A little pricey, but worth it for a special occasion"}
{"text":"We got their patatas bravas...or was it patatas emperor? Nonetheless we ordered it fully loaded with BLood sausage. Wow, this isn't even in the same category of poutines but it tops any fried potato dish i've had. The spaniards got it right.  We ordered a half order of octopus, which was a huge meaty order as it is. It's juicy, fresh, and cooked to the right consistency. But that grilled char had an enchanting effect, seriously missing that taste and I doubt I can replicate anything like that in my kitchen or grill.  Lastly their cocktails: Wow. It's much different from the list I saw the year before (where I was blown away with the coffee cocktail they made for me a la \"choose your own adventure\"). This time I ordered Isabel's take on the old fashioned, while my date ordered their take on a cuban mojito. The old fashion was solid but my gf's drink was CHAMPION: served on a chilled julep glass with tropical toppings. Their drinks were deceivingly strong but I managed a third drink,"}
{"text":"Got a reservation and ate a lot of things here. The food & drinks are very good. The octopus was fun - so big and cute sitting there with all its legs out for display. It tasted good too. We didn't eat dessert since we ate a lot of other things off the menu.   The service was great. The wait staff are very attentive and try hard to make it a good dining experience.   The decor is very old-style hipster-geared. I almost expected to see a typewriter behind the bar at the cash. I guess that is the style these days. However, the acoustics are terrible, and it was extremely loud. Just come here to eat, not to talk, because you have to shout to be heard."}
{"text":"I give this a 3.5. I guess with all of the hype, I was expecting more. Ordered the tasting menu for two since I've heard so many good things about their main dishes, that I wanted to explore little bits and pieces of them. Some of them were excellent (the sweetbreads, oysters, and albacore tuna) - but I always felt that some of them were missing something. The servers were very attentive, and had thorough knowledge on all of the dishes, which was something that I had appreciated. It's loud, but still an intimate setting. The final octopus dish was ... interesting. Soft and chewy, but a little bit tasteless imo. I would go again (maybe), but order one of the main entrees instead. The food was still good, but lost a bit of value for me since it didn't really meet my high expectations, and only the high price on the bill."}
{"text":"We went to Bar Isabel for an anniversary, and it was definitely what we expected in terms of venue look and food quality. we had tried a lot of the tapas. but the one that stand out is the black pig in the jamon tasting. its true that the food is a bit pricier, however if you go on a special occasion is it is very nice. the grilled beef tongue was also another highlight, it was wonderfully juicy and tasty. Overall the experiences is very romantic low lights, and feels like a great place to hang out with a few friends over a drink and some food. The only thing that this place misses for me, is that the menus are all in spanish and the servers themselves have to explain every menu item to us. i would prefer that there was some form of description on the menu to let us know what everything is, because sometimes even the servers are not exactly sure how to describe certain foods.  I would recommend people in the area to try it out, as it is a nice place to be, and is one of the better tapas place in the city"}
{"text":"My brother and I came here while we were visiting Toronto and could not be more please that we did! It is a tapas menu...small plates for sharing. It seemed like unique courses and fairly classic Spanish tapas. We asked the wait staff to put together a tasting menu for use to keep us surprised and happy! We set a price limit for cost of food per person and then they delivered. The dishes flowed out one after the other in a wonderfully synchronized fashion with delicious courses! If you go here, you will not be disappointed. Let me not pass over the bar tender...I am upset I am forgetting his name. But, he was very nice, friendly, and helpful. And - he could make a serious drink. We would give him some suggestions and he would craft a unique cocktail that was delicious! He even wrote his concoctions down for me to try at home!  We loved this spot!"}
{"text":"I think this place was a little overhyped. But food was good nonetheless. Definitely get the bask cake. That will melt in your mouth and you will feel like you had your first foodgasm. Ribeye with fois gras is good too, but a bit pricey. Ambiance is great cus it's super dark and romantic-feeling."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Amazing Spanish tapas bar with top notch cocktails and service  Drinks: We asked the waiter to surprise us with some cocktails and just described what we were looking for.  We ended up with the Señor Moltisanti - a refreshing, not-too-sweet citrus-y creamy cocktail.  The second was the Heisenberg, a slightly smoky and less sweet.  Food: We started off with some bar snacks - some pickled vegetables and bread.  The pickles were really well done.  The bread was, well, bread - sliced and served with olive oil.  Then we proceeded on with a tasting meal.  We went into it blind and could not be happier.    - Foie gras: A+, really really tasty and a great way to start off the meal.   - Swordfish: A-, served as thin slices with smoked olives, sweet peas, crispy jamon (Spanish ham).  - Anchovy boquerones with chips: B+, the chips contain some dehydrated lime zest and works really well with the anchovies though you'll end up with chips left over.  - Shishoto peppers: B+, a good palate cleanser, salty  - Vegan no-show salad: A+, a surprise hit.  The salad contains pomegranates which really work well.  - Wild mushrooms with sugar snap peas, ham and mint: A, really nice mushroom medley.  - Grilled razor clams: A+, incredible.  I wouldn't have normally ordered this so I'm happy they included this dish.  The razor clams have a different consistency then the typical clams you'd eat.  It's a bit chewy but not too rubbery.  It's also smothered in a, what I presume to be in a wine/butter sauce.  Definitely dip bread in it.  - Grilled Octopus: A+, really really tasty.  It wasn't too rubbery and really had the perfect texture.  It was served on a bed of dandelion greens which were a bit salty.  - Dessert: Basque Cake & Sherry Cream: A++.  Already bursting at the seams after dinner, unbuckling my belt wasn't enough to create space for dessert.  I decided to give it a shot though, and like magic, my body created a separate dessert compartment in my stomach to let me indulge in this heavenly dessert.  Words can't describe how amazing this was. There is a bit of a corn bread quality to it.   Service: A+: Water and wine were always refilled promptly.  Servers were friendly.  Tips: - Make reservations a few weeks in advance if you're going on a weekend - Get the tasting menu course - Cocktails are delicious"}
{"text":"Duh. This place is a legend. Making a reservation is best but they always try to fit us in when we're in the neighbourhood and show up hungry! Service is performed by the whole staff, they never make you wait longer than they have to for anything."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit was the night after my first. I just couldn't get the chickpea dish out of my head and needed to go back for more.   After my first visit of cocktails and snacks, I was so impressed I wanted to go back for a full dinner. You'll see the full grilled octopus come up in many reviews; there's a reason for that - it's that good.   Already looking forward to visit 3."}
{"text":"No exactly authentic Spanish tapas, but the food was good. Would definitely go back. The music was a bit loud."}
{"text":"BAR ISABEL's Best Chops By Yelp Hungry Guy  WaYnE c. meets Isabel to tapas some spanish flavours {3.5'd}.  WINNER: BASQUE IN THE GLORY      Basque Cake & Sherry Cream, $8.50 \"I WANT CAKE,\" WaYnE says. He joyously sings~ If I die young, bury me in SHERRY CREAM, lay me down on a bed of BASQUE CAKE, *float* me in the river, at dawn, send me away with the words of a FAT song  -=The King has Spoken=-      Roast Alaskan King Crab 1/2 LB, $20.00 The buttery smoky sauce was a surprise. \"The dish\" reminds me of Chili Crab which btw isn't spicy, with a sprinkle of lemon it balances out this sauce nicely\" WaYnE finds. There's just enough sauce to coat the crab, no overflow remained and unfortunately I had a piece that was overly salty, luck of the draw it was my last one.  -=Say Sea Bream en Français=-      Whole Fish Ceviche, $26.00 \"Waiting for a Fish to bite in France\" Yelper says. That's what it felt like as the minutes flew by and we patiently await the meaty morsels to take the bait.  Cilantro, avocado, red onion comes on your standard issue model, and fried leek represented seaweed but I'm just making that up to amuse myself.  -=Now you're speaking my Language=-      Hopfenstark, Ostalgia Blonde (750ml) 5.5%, $22.00 The bar attendant{+0.5} speaks beer and speaks it well. \"I would have thought the green dude on the bottle was drunk and ready to uppercut someone\" WaYnE silently said.

{"text":"My boyfriend and I traveled from Chicago to eat at the well know bar Isabel! We were grateful to get a seat at the bar. The food is outstanding. The service is very nice. A little confusion with menu knowledge on our bartenders end. We were told two different things by two different people about whether a dish could be made a specific way of not. When the bartender found out he was in the wrong, we could see of his extreme frustration. My boyfriend manages a restaurant in Schaumburg and we have very high standards when we go out in Chicago. Bar Isabel met and exceeded our expectations! Thank you chef for an outstanding meal and taking time to talk with us! We will be back hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Paid $60 for some cold cuts and a bone, with potatoes. Glass of water was of high quality.  Good staff. Manager winked at me to acknowledge my existence. Waitress knew things about the menu.  Good ambience. Light fixtures hang from the ceiling with different colours, made me feel happy while eating my cold cuts and bone. Silverware was made of real silver. Jazz music in the background, along with other very non-Spanish music.  3/5"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! A genuine taste of Spain in Toronto. I've tried to come here on a number of occasions but it is always packed and there is generally a lengthy wait. Make sure to get a reservation, if possible.   The menu consists of authentic Spanish tapas (meat, cheese, grilled octopus, and crusty bread with real olive oil) and an extensive wine list (including a red from a fabulous and underrated Ontario winery, Lailey). My only critique is that the octopus was slightly overcooked but that in and of itself is not worthy of a 4-star rating -  everything else was delightful!  The service was superb (no snobbiness or hipsterness) and everyone had a smile on. They have a very well-organized coat room scheme that I found quite impressive (someone just randomly appears with your coat when you're ready to go). This did not go unnoticed.  I'm not surprised that Bar Isabel has been rated Toronto's \"best restaurant\". They have it all down: food quality, service, decor, and drinks. Excellent work!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try Bar Isabel for over a year but never attempted even trying to get a reservation. Walking by one night I noticed it was super empty around 11pm and went in with a friend. The decor/atmosphere and food was all amazing! Be prepared to spend a bit and try lots of new things!"}
{"text":"You really need to make reservations to get a spot, especially on the weekends. The environment is unique, hipster and lively. I love the music, the waiters are nice and attentive.   My boyfriend and i started off with the meat and cheese platter, it was quite tasty and surprisingly large in portion. There were two types of meats and two types of cheese. We ordered an extra side of bread but the crust was so hard and not edible.   For the entree we ordered the razor clams and 1/2 lb of octopus. The razor clams were so good. The sauce/juice was bursting with flavours, it was delicious, i wanted to lick the plate clean, instead they provided us with free bread to dip the remaining sauce.  We then had the 1/2 lb of the famous octopus. I was expecting this dish to be outstanding but i thought it was just alright. Didn't really have much flavour in the octopus, the veggies/potatoes that came with it was kind of bland, nothing too special. I believe it was $40 for 1/2 the octopus, a bit pricy in my opinion. Our waiter forgot about our 3rd entree and i'm glad he did because i was sooo stuffed. The portions were average but the flavours were rich and notably filing.  Overall, the food was great, environment was lovely. Not sure if it's the \"best\" restaurant in Toronto but it's up there. Quite pricy but it's #1 on most food list so they can pretty much charge anything."}
{"text":"Hard to get a table but justifiably so. This place is a gem. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"This place is over hyped. I've had better tapas with more options. It is also not worth the price tag. The cheese plate was not fresh, the shishito peppers did not have much flavor. The ambiance was nice though."}
{"text":"Very simple food executed perfectly. The service although not exactly very friendly was very prompt. Everybody grabbing our finished plates just as we needed them to be. Meals came in appropriate manner. All apps, iberico, shrimp and quail egg, bravas were all executed well. The main dishes is where this place shines. The Cornish hen and the steak are to die for!"}
{"text":"Nice cocktails, good ambience. Prices too high for portions of food. I know that it is a tapas restaurant but I wanted more for the money.  Patatas bravas are delish."}
{"text":"I love Bar Isabel. Hubby and I have been here twice now with family and both times left very full and satiated.  The atmosphere is dimly lit, intimate, and cozy despite the restaurant being very busy. The servers here are extremely helpful and attentive, and quite knowledgeable about wine pairings. They do allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee.  We opted for a tasting menu where food was brought out family style. We enjoyed the cured meat and cheese platter with garden pickles - simple but incredibly flavourful! We were served roasted peppers which were for the most part were not spicy but just not the highlight of the meal. Where Bar Isabel particularly excels is with their proteins. The grilled octopus was like no other place I've had it - tender and certainly far from the rubbery octopus sometimes found at other restaurants. I especially enjoyed the ribeye and chimichurri sauce, which was perfectly cooked with a light crust on the exterior of the meat, and also very tender and flavourful.   A visit to Bar Isabel is never complete without the Basque cake. In fact, when we dine here as a family of 6-7, we often order 2-3 of these delectable cakes. Honestly I often dream about the Basque cake and how it arrives at the table warm and crunchy from the oven, perfuming the table with a light vanilla scent, and enhanced with the sherry cream poured over it... seriously my mouth waters thinking about how good it is!  The meal is not inexpensive but it is well worth the price paid for the consistent and delicious food and dining experience.  (76/100)"}
{"text":"From the perspective of a traveler:  Having been here for dinner a few times now, I can definitely recommend Isabel for its delicious food, wonderful atmosphere and excellent service.  My favorite places tend to be like this, where you can more or less come as you are and be treated to an indulgent evening.  The name of the game here is tapas, and you shouldn't be afraid to try anything on the menu. The quality of the food is uniformly excellent.  My recommendation is to let them take the wheel and do the tasting menu - they will ask for your nitpicky food preferences, allergy problems and then send out plates of wonderful Spanish cuisine.  Now, most people in Toronto are awesome.  I have had so much fun here but now and again, in this city and in this industry in particular, you do sometimes run into a fucking uppity Canuck who for whatever reason thinks he's a New Yorker.  Our server cracked a joke at the expense of where everyone at our table was from.  I rolled my eyes and brushed it off.  Don't let this make you averse to coming to this restaurant, which in my opinion is one of the very best by Canadian standards.  Amazing food, attentive service, dim lights, fun and jovial atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was our third time to the restaurant in a one year period, and with each time the calibre of the food has declined. The service and cocktails were excellent, but did not compensate for tough over cooked rib-eye, and other dishes we ordered that were disappointing. Noise level meant it was challenging to carry on a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"Although you have to reserve weeks ahead of time for a table on most nights, Bar Isabel is one of Toronto's little gems. Not only are the cocktails elegant and well-constructed, they're also accompanied by mouth-watering food. My favourite were the smoked sweetbreads served on little pieces of hamachi crudo with a lovely meyer lemon sauce. I still dream about these. The patatas bravas are also very good. I came here for the first time on my own, and a year later with my wife - both times were delectable (if a little expensive). Go and try all the dishes, or stop in for a drink and a bite (the bar makes an excellent Negroni)."}
{"text":"Went back for a second time and was a bit disappointed. There are changes to the menu and to be honest, not many of the new choices appealed to me.   On the recommendation of a couple beside us, we tried the ceviche which they raved about. My opinion, disgusting! It sits ontop of a whole fish, which is unappealing. The ceviche itself was creamy, which I'm not accustomed to and the fried, silvered leeks, felt like fish bones in your mouth.  Fried squid, delicious. Tuna, yummy. We ordered one basque cake but ate it like savages, so we ordered another .  The quality of the staff continues to be great!!"}
{"text":"Worth the money spent.  Bone marrow, foie gras tapas, octopus... All so delicious!! Stand out cocktails that are worth the price tag.  Been here twice and would love to come back again, if only it weren't so busy (selfishly so I can eat there every night).  They're doing everything right!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Oh, Bar Isabel, if only you weren't so darn noisy! I really like the ambiance here, it's dark and romantic. However, during my last visit, my experience was unfortunately punctured by a very loud group that sat across from us. The restaurant is always packed when I go so I would recommend reservations. Despite the large group I saw mostly couples so I would say it's more of a date location or an intimate tapas date with some close friends - I think I just had bad luck the last time!   On my last visit, I came here with my 2 girlfriends and we ordered several things on the menu. The ones that really stood out to me were the bone marrow (#1!!!), the sweet breads, and the whole fish ceviche. The bone marrow was one of the best I've ever had, and it was so simple. You know it's quality bone marrow when it's not loaded with extra toppings and seasonings. The sweet breads had a rich taste and lovely soft texture. The presentation of the whole fish ceviche was something to be admired. The outside shell of the fish was fried so you could eat it! It was crunchy and not greasy. The ceviche had a lovely citrus taste and wasn't overly sour like some other ceviche's I've had.   Other things we ordered included the house salad, which was just ordinary (we needed some greens so opted for that) and the patatas, again just ordinary, but a nice palette cleanser for the rich foods we got.   The service was excellent. Our waitress answered all the questions we had and checked up on us at regular intervals.   Parking can be found on the street or green p surface lot nearby."}
{"text":"Sorry Bar Isabel.. Wasn't a fan. We arrived here after months of yelp stalking and raving recommendations but unfortunately we left feeling like the place was overhyped and overpriced.   The menu was much smaller than I had anticipated and we decided to go for: 1) Sweet bread and foie gras - the advertised sweet bread turned out to be small crostinis and I've had foie gras before but I felt like I was eating a stick of butter/lard lacking in foie gras taste..   2) Mixed meat and cheese plate - the meat and chorizo we liked but the cheese all tasted the same with little variation.   3) Halibut ceviche - fresh and acidic but the flavours were just alright and the portion wasn't big enough to warrant $28  4) Half octopus - I was super excited about this one and it looked really promising with all its crazy looking tentacles. The octopus turned out to be really tender and well prepared. It could definitely use more flavouring but if I had to recommend one thing it would be the octopus.  5) I liked their sourdough bread and olives. Freshly prepared and the olives were huge!  For $40 per person tapa meal.. We left still hungry and went for gelato after..  Last thing I wanted to mention is that we had someone with a nut allergy and our server didn't seem too knowledgeable about the exact kind of nuts in the kitchen and whether the bread would be okay for someone with a nut allergy to eat. She told us that 'we should be fine..' Not too reassuring.. They should really make sure their staff has better training to meet the needs of people with dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Just really the best. I've been here twice, the first time I loved it and the second time I loved it even more! They changed a lot of their menu items since I was there a few months back and it's really just so amazing.   From looking at the menu it's unclear how many veggie options there are (so many of the words I had no idea what they were) but the servers are really friendly and helpful. Our server told me what could be made vegetarian and how much food we should order. We ordered mostly from the starters menu and my fave was the mushroom toasts (SOOOO GOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) Also love the plate of cheese options, and just listen to what your server tells you to get! Ours told us to get the Basque cake so obviously we did and it was INCREDIBLE, seriously there are no words, the best dessert I've had in a really long time, melt in your mouth goodness, JUST GET IT."}
{"text":"This is a super cozy spot to grab tapas and drinks; the interior is dimly lit, and would be great for a date! ;)  I tried the el sherry cocktail, which was delicious; it had sherry, pomegranate, oranges, and rosemary. It was a quite salty/sour, however, but was definitely interesting!  I also got the patatas bravas; however, they were large pieces of potato and were quite soft, and the sauce was not that flavorful, which was a disappointment. At el camino in Ottawa, their patatas bravas were much better.   Service was very attentive, and the waitress came by to check up and take orders quickly. Next time I might try more main dishes/larger tapas, but it's definitely a really cozy spot to grab drinks!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time and it's safe to say from my first visit,  that this is the best bar in Toronto. Got the Cured meat plate (house cured), squid,  bread and olive oil,  Treu Du Diable Saison to drink. So it was a small order but enough to get me excited to come back.  Like tonight. The ambiance,  the music,  the food,  the service.... All 11/10. Bar Isabel kicks ass."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved everything about it. Drinks, food, service, all just perfect!  My favorite dish was by far the Cerviche. We had the octopus too, which I wasnt a huge fan of. But well, that mainly has to do with the fact that I'm not a big fan of octopus....   Great drinks and good wine too. Will for sure return!"}
{"text":"Pretty close to a five. The best new restaurant in Canada in 2013 did live up to its lofty expectations. The place has a very hipster Spanish vibe. Servers are friendly and energetic. Also of note is a distinct amber glow from the ambient lights that soften the mood. A nice touch for your romantic dinner plans. The bar mixes up some very complex cocktails.  Food highlights, the grilled octopus was surprisingly meaty in texture. Not your typically chew, interesting and tasty. The sweetbreads on a tuna crude was a delicious bite.  If you're famished, the tongue sandwich on brioche is soft and buttery. Don't be turned off by tongue, it is actually sliced thin and comes out like a pastrami sandwich. Stacked tall in size, so you can share a half each.  Overall a very pleasant experience. They are pretty busy these days but it's a nice setting and tasty menu to pass away a night of dinning."}
{"text":"Solid choice. Great drinks, very good food, fantastic dessert. The basque cake. oh my god i could eat it for days."}
{"text":"Service, food and ambiance are all top notch! I've been waiting to go there and it did NOT disappoint. Got the meat and cheese platter, bone marrow and grilled calamari. All were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favourite restaurant for food. Pricey on the drinks. Although they are known for the grilled octopus, I found that it was nothing special and I have never ordered it again. The Cumbrae's 18 oz Dry-Aged Ribeye is to die for!!! So amazing! It is literally perfect. The bone marrow is another must try item on the menu. The bone marrow is huge. Every time I have dinner here, those are the two items I always order and i'll try some new items.   Atmosphere is chilling - great for a date or for catching up with some friends :)  Only downfall for this place is that you need to make reservations for  3 weeks in advance. But totally worth the wait! You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Very casual and busy place for tapas! Had the fresh anchovy/chili with homemade nachos, scotch eggs, green chorizo, and whole fish ceviche. Each dish was very tasty building up to the main, that I could not decide which one was my favorite!  Would recommend if you're looking for a happening yet unique place with delicious food!"}
{"text":"We went here absolutely full from dinner at an izakaya just wanting to have some drinks. Then we ended up ordering a platter that s**t load of food ranging from crab legs,  fragra,  fried chicken,  octopus,  etc etc. and we devoured it loving and savoring every bite in our gluttonous state. And then we had some dessert.  I've never done this before until bar Isabel...  Neff said."}
{"text":"I initially walked in and i thought \"wow, what a cool spot\" . Decor 10. Music 10. The fact i was able to get a table at 7pm on a Friday night without a reservation 10.  Everything was going well until the server reminded us at 730 that we had to be out of our seat at 830 (the host said 840 upon seating). That certainly put a sour taste in our mouths. Not to worry--it didnt interrupt the quality of food. We had the salumi plate, peppers, deviled eggs and asparagus. All exceptional.  You know, nothing frustrates me more when what could be a great restaurant is totally sewered by poor service.  In case you were wondering, our waitress returned at 830 only to let us know that they would \"let\" us stay until 9pm (the restaurant was 75% empty). In my eyes, totally bush league and this represents (yet again) what is wrong with the \"hipster industry\"--making you feel lucky to PAY to eat at their restaurant.  If it wasnt for the service, this restaurant scores an easy 4.5 stars. Instead it takes a lowly three. Once again, hipsters insist on reminding us why they suck."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place so I figure I better check it out and see what the buzzzzzz is.  Well the buzz was lively as soon as you walk in.  The feel is very hip, fresh but at the same old school.  The decor was mostly all wood and felt like your grand parents house and the music, which was a mix of 50-90's music just made the atmosphere much more cooler yet old school.  We were seated by the bar, which is my fav spot because you get to see the action of the mixologists shaking, whirling, mixing, and stirring.  It was fun and entertaining at the same time even when one of the taps blew up and I got some beer on me.  The server looked embarrassed but I told her \"things could be worse\" and gave her a smile just to ease her mind.    As we were seated we were asked if we wanted drinks so I do what i always do and ask \"what's your fav?\" and let them choose because they know what is the best of the best.  I was recommended the bullfighter or something and it was STIFF....i mean STIFF.  I like my stiff drinks but this was STIFF LOL no complaints though because it went well with the dishes.  We ordered the devilled duck eggs with blood sausage, chorizo and octopus skewers, fried chicken, and the shaved tongue on brioche.    Every single dish was different but out of this world.  the flavours were bold yet subtle.  the colours were vibrant yet mute.  it was a great mix and match type thing and it all tasted like heaven.  I highly recommend this place because the vibe is cool, the food is awesome, the staff is friendly, service top notch, drinks stiff and strong.  Everything i look for in a resto!  Good on you guys and keep it up."}
{"text":"Who said this place was divey?? It was gorgeous inside, very rustic and did remind me a lot of Spain. The tiles and the lighting, so beautiful -- it felt very warm inside. Incredible service, very friendly and prompt. They also take reservations but even on a Tuesday night they were fully booked after 6pm until 11 ! Got the Deviled Duck Eggs: Not the biggest fan of blood sausage but it was seriously better than what I had in Spain, very soft and moist. Something was a bit gamey though, maybe the egg or the sausage. Not sure if I'd get this again. Chorizo/Octopus: Really delicious. Octopus was cooked perfectly and went well with the chorizo but they was too much of the latter and it tended to overpower it. Good if you just want a tasting sample of their octopus.  Bone Marrow: Like the one at the Hoof. It looked huge, but there wasn't much marrow in it and the bread to marrow ratio was off. However, it was delicious and the sauce went really well with it.  Patatas Bravas: Glorified spicy tater tots. Really liked them though.  Tongue on Brioche: Thank god I can get this somewhere other than the Hoof!! It was my favourite thing there, and dare I say, it might actually be better? Meat was incredibly soft and succulent, good full flavour, and nice sauce drizzled on top (would've liked more of this). The food may not have been completely authentic but I thought it was a fairly innovative take on Spanish cuisine at a reasonable price (w/o drinks). Enjoy!  All in all Food: 4/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5  Will I be back? Yes, it is our intention to have a seafood feast the next time!! The whole octopus, crab legs and ceviche looked heavenly. Will update when that happens."}
{"text":"I've heard about Bar Isabel for quite some time and I was glad to finally make it down to try the food. I've always been a fan of Tapas style food but this place had its ups and downs.  The decor brings to into Spain, with the rustic charm of a spanish home you feel like a guest in someone's home! The dim yellow lights only add to the ambiance and its the perfect place to go unwind after a long day or week for food and drinks. The staff were very courteous and extremely knowledgeable  about the menu. It was great to see that the restaurant wanted until we finished each dish to allow us to enjoy the food. Each dish was put in particular order for us to have an enjoyable experience.   We started off with the chef's choice of cheese for our cheese plate with a side of their homemade sourdough bread. The bread so amazingly fresh and still warm from the oven, the cheese selection was spectacular and I wish we had more.  Next we had the roast bone marrow served with again their sourdough bread and a chimichurri Sauce. The dish was fantastic, the rich fatty goodness from the bone marrow was cut with the bright and citrus flavor from the chimichurri sauce to balance the dish.  The smoke Sweetbreads with fresh Ahi Tuna was the next course. The sweetbreads were so most and tender and the fresh tuna just took it to a whole new level. It was an unexpected dish that was absolutely delicious.  Patas Bravas Imperial: This is a spanish equivalent to the Works Poutine. It had crispy cooked potatoes dusted with paprika, with house pickled anchovies, jalepenos and blood sausage. Over the top deliciousness.  Grilled Octopus: This was the dish I was looking forward to the most but I was sadly disappointed. It was overcooked and tough to chew. The presentation was great but it lacked in flavor.  Overall, it was a positive experience at Bar Isabel and I would definitely go again, this time I would get the sea bream ceviche."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for a nice dinner after a day of walking around at the ROM. We typically love going on College to try new restaurants and so far, we haven't ever been disappointed.  Food: I love how the Spanish cuisine is really big on seafood, spices, and comfort style food. Bar Isabel definitely fulfills the criteria of comprehensive Spanish Tapas! The server recommended the Sobressada (foie on toast) and Grilled octopus. The Sobressada is definitely mouth-watering and very indulgent! The grilled octopus also did not disappoint and was cooked perfectly (not tough at all). On top of the recommendations, we also tried the fresh shucked oysters which ended up being a great start to the course! The side of red pepper foam and onion mignonette had a great balance of acidity, sweetness and heat. Our main entree/meat was the Fideo Stew with chicken thighs. Typically at a tapas restaurant, you would see Fideo prepared as Fiduea (pan fried thin noodles), but this method of preparing the fideo noodles really made me feel like I was eating a typical family style meal in Spain! The chicken was tender, the seasoning was spot on, and the portion was great. I think the highlight of the menu was the dessert. Even though my husband and I were totally stuffed, we opted to try their Basque Cake with Sherry Cream because it was highly recommended. IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT! The general body of the cake was moist, rich and buttery. The Sherry cream provided the creaminess and sweetness to the cake. They also had an option of adding Foie to the dessert which would probably send it over the top!  We've been to other tapas style restaraunts such as Patria and Cava and I would say Bar Isabel is right up there in terms of quality, diversity in dishes, and atmosphere!  Drinks: My husband and I dropped in at around 6:20pm and it was packed full and the only available seats in the house were at the bar. Great place to sit if you plan to stay for a while and have drinks all night! The bartending staff and mixologists were very keen on making sure we were taken care of for drinks. They have amazing cocktails and great selections of beer on draught!  Overall, we were impressed and we definitely would want to go back to try their grilled razor clams, patates brava, sea bream ceviche, ah heck - I want to try everything there :p"}
{"text":"after being turned away at another TAPAS bar due to not having reservations, we were determined to go to another one! Hence Bar Isabel, which can be easily missed when you're not attentively looking for it.  Dark building with just the lit-up words \"ISABEL\" First off, this place was jammed pack! though we didnt have any reservations, the wait was approximately 15mins. Our table was by the bar, which was entertaining enough, as we watched the bartender shake that martini like he was trying to shake PAINT in a Canister!!! She had their beer, while I had their 08 Tempranillo...yum! at $15/glass it was pricey, but still so good. We ordered their tapas: Pan con Hamon Iberico: 5/5 Thinly sliced cured meat on sour dough bread was delish! too bad it was only 2 slices...haha...  Chips, Boquerones, Piquillo, Jalapeno: 4/5 beautiful presentacion! perfect balance of salt with the fish, and picantes! was great, not to mention with the help of the chips it added some crunch to the dish!  Patatas Bravas: 5/5 so yummy, this helped absorb the vino and biera! topped off with sweet, creamy, and tangy sauce, it was enjoyable, much like spanish nachos!  Morcilla, Salt Cured Foie Gras & Brioche: 5/5 I have to say this dish was a hit! I've never had Morcillo (meat blood pudding) so it was a definite treat! the salt foie gras and brioche cheese unified the dish and added some versatile flavor to this tapa  chickpeas with greens: 2/5  the chickpeas were slightly perfect, some were harder than others, not the best dish to get, however since it was vegetarian...meh..  overall the staff are very welcoming, and helpful when it comes to decision making.  I would definitely make this one of my hotspots....after all i love tapas......part of my part-Spanish roots jaja..... chau!"}
{"text":"We went to Bar Isabel last night. Service and food were both impeccable. I've spent time working in Spain and the food is on par, if not better, with the best that Madrid has to offer.   Service:  Service was fantastic. Friendly, enthusiastic and really knowledgeable wait staff. Water was refreshed, coats were whisked away to a cloakroom, food and drink recommendations were always spot on, plates disappeared quickly but without any rush. Excellent all round.   Food:  We ate our way through the starter menu. Raw tuna, chorizo verde, ham, marinated anchovies, Scotch Egg and some other dishes. The only dish we weren't in love with was the squid with crispy tongue - it was weirdly soggy and the spiciness was too raw on the tongue for us. But, a really minor quibble with what was amazing food, well presented.   Additionally there are great, if somewhat expensive, drinks available  and a beer menu that is probably the best in Toronto.    Quibbles:   I am not giving five stars for three reasons:   1. The room is excessively noisy, so much that it almost impossible to have a conversation across the table. It really took away from the enjoyment of the evening.   2. It was freezing cold. People sitting with us kept their jackets on, or asked for them back, because of the icy draft coming from the vents.   The temperature might have just been a fluke, but the noise levels are what they are I suspect. The beautifully tiled floor is probably responsible for this. Perhaps some softer surfaces could solve the problem.  3. The room is dark (which is ok) but the type on the menu is small and hard to read. We had to hunt for a beam of light to be able to read what was on offer. Both the table on the left and the right of us ended up using their phones to illuminate their menus."}
{"text":"Spectacular food and drinks. Love the vibe.  Everything was exquisite.  Dying to come back."}
{"text":"Nice date spot ^^  Intimate lighting in a cosy space. The food is next level. Grilled octopus and red shrimp are fire. Seating is limited so be sure to reserve seats. All in all it's a nice change of pace if you're not in the mood for loud music or large crowds."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall...I just had really high expectations due to the raving reviews,  difficult to book reservations and etc...this was on a Wednesday night...   1) Yes we booked well in advance, when I called around 7ish, since we were starving.. they said sorry nothing earlier available....booo...   2) Was being sat on a small table and even though we said like we're starving and will order alot... nope...   3) considering the fact, we were alll starving... anything that we eat is suppose to be awesome...but I didn't get that...   4) ordered ceviche, octopus, razor clams, I forgot the rest...  All in all,  the reviews are overated...I had exceptionally high expectations but I got 3.5 star service and food..."}
{"text":"Wow..just wow. Bar Isabel blew me away. It's been a while since I've had anything that was unique and tasted great. We started off with the mussels. Soft and refreshing. The Sobrasada & Foie Gras on a toast was out of this world. The spiciness from the sobrasada was cleverly balanced with the sweetness of the shaved foie gras, which just melted in your mouth. The sweetbreads in Sweetbreads and Raw Tuna were superb, and went well with the tuna. The Pork Jowl Secreto had a rather firm texture, and yet it was tender. I'm used to pork jowl being braised and all soft, so this one was a nice twist. Last, we got a quarter order of the octopus. I expected a lot from this dish as everyone seems to order it. It was definitely good, but it didn't stand out.   For the Basque Cake & Sherry Cream, we were debating whether we should add foie gras to it. We decided against it. The Basque cake was rich and the sherry cream made it even richer. I'm glad we decided not to add foie gras, as I just cannot imagine how it could work out.   The ambiance was cozy with low lights. It was difficult to read the food menu, as it was only one small page, and everything was a one liner without description. Luckily, our server was nice and patient in explaining the menu to us.   I hardly ever wish to go back to a restaurant, but the next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely go back to Bar Isabel!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is worth the hype to me. We were a group of 5 people and ordered a bunch of items on the menu. It's tapas style so it's the best way to do it. We Ordered 2 bottles of wine, ceviche, carpaccio, shishito peppers, sobrasada&foie gras, patatas bravas, half octopus, rib eye and the basque cake.  We loved everything ! Highlights: foie gras tartine ceviche, rib eye and the basque cake It's on the pricy side but we were extremely full so at least we can say it's worth it.  The server was very patient  The vibe is casual  Thumbs up Isabel"}
{"text":"Octopus is very good. As is the steak. Pretty much, everything is very good. Bar Isabel is a spanish restaurant that serves a lot of tapas and main courses that are meant to be shared by everyone. The menu shows a lot of the dishes in spanish with no descriptions in english underneath so if you don't understand it, then you'll need to have the waiter explain it to you. Pretty much, just get a bit of everything because everything is very tasty. The drinks menu is also extremely large. I personally enjoined the Isabel Old Fashioned.   If you want to come here, make sure you do a reservation because the place is almost always packed. The interior is dark and is extremely loud. It's kind of like a bar atmosphere that serves really good food. I definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"A small and cozy Spanish tapas bar and restaurant located on Ossington, this is a great place to feel sexy and cool.  Dimly lit, this restaurant/bar serves up a small but interesting taps menu.  Definitely make reservations because it is always packed.  We came here at 6pm (when it opens) and managed to get a table.  We ordered for the table: octopus, stuffed peppers, garlic snow pea shoots; carpaccio; some sort of potato cake type dish and one other dish with chorizo in it.  The octopus can be ordered as quarter, half or full so depending on how many people want to try it you can choose accordingly.  It was delicious- tender and lightly flavored.  Eat it fast though bc when it sits for a bit the texture starts becoming rubbery.  I didn't particularly care for the stuffed peppers- it lacked some flavour and were a bit boring.  The dish with chorizo- as I don't eat pork the server was so lovely to bring the dish over with the chorizo on a separate plate - that was instead of being mixed into the dish I could eat the rest of the dish!    The service we had was lovely- our server asked us about food restrictions and made recommendations and suggestions when we had questions about the menu.    I'll definitely come back here - it's just a great night!"}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and it definitely lived up to its expectations.   Service was top notch :) Everyone was super attentive. I love the ambience it is a great place for a fun date.  Note the noise level is loud but I was still able to talk to my friend.   As for food here are my must orders -Spicy Beef tartar - amazing  -Half octopus -Scallop Ceviche - I wanted to order a 2nd  -Sobrasada Foie Gras - really interesting texture as I bit into it I felt like my lips were biting into fluffy airy clouds! It was trippy but delicious.   These were just *meh* to me -Jamon Croquetas - too mushy inside and it wasn't very warm. -Bone marrow - not bad , just wasn't out of this world wowza.   I had a great time at bar isabel and would definitely come back. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures because the resto is very dark . I attempted to take a picture with flash (trying to pull a *I have no shame* moment) but it wasnt nice and I was too shy to take another on after I realized everyone was blinded by my flash the first time lol."}
{"text":"The server was really pushy. He asked three times if I wanted to add meat to my vegetarian dish. I wanted vegetarian that day. It was really off putting. I don't like when servers act like salesmen."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the food here. I always have a great experience here. The atmosphere is cozy and the service is great. It's a bit dark and the setting is very casual. It's usually quite loud and busy.   Some of my favorite items are the octopus, bone marrow, and raw tuna. The bone marrow is a MUST! I also love ordering some cured meats, cheese, and bread at every visit.    I highly recommend all locals to come. It's a bit on the west in a quieter neighborhood but it's totally worth coming!"}
{"text":"short review - very tasty and properly excecuted spanish-ish food in a nice atmosphere with good drinks and great service... and they take reservations!  long review - went here with three other guys a couple weeks after it opened, and shared the following:  mixed plate of charcuterie (chosen by the chef) - not too impressed by the selection, most of the meats were fairly dry and didn't have a strong flavour, except the chorizo bread/olives/pickeled veg - fairly standard, hard to ask for olive oil to dip the bread in though  spanish blood sausage - beautifully creamy and lighter than i expected, very nice two orders of bone marrow - good portion size, and bone marrow is always sinfully delicious... glad we ordered two! two orders of raw horse + hot sauce - very tasty, couldn't really tell that it was horse though, the hot sauce kind of dominated the flavour chicken wing escabeche - kind of strange... double-fried, so you would expect them to be crispy, but then they're soaked in vinegar to make them soft. very tender chicken wings, probably wouldn't get them again though  3 lb red snapper ceviche - fantastic; the middle of the snapper was cut into large chunks, mixed with citrus and avocado, and topped with deep-fried crispy onions. the remaining portion of fish was then flash-fried and acted as an edible serving vessel (and rich contrast) to the fresh ceviche inside... the whole-fish preparation gave me the opportunity to try fish eyes for the first time! large grilled octopus and potatoes - they're already famous for this, and rightfully so... the presentation is so cool, and the portion is gigantic. we found that the flavouring was a little overwhelming at the tips of the octopus arms, but as we worked closer to the body, the balance between octopus and spanish flavourings balanced out and left us full but still craving more!  in addition to the food, the beer selection and cocktails are impressive, and the service is far above-par. i definitely also appreciate that they hold half of the restaurant for reservations every day.   there was a couple of missteps in the menu, but the main thing holding me back from a full 5-star review is that the value isn't quite there - for the amount that we paid i would expect flawless execution."}
{"text":"Dim and yet lively was my immediate impression around 1230 am when I came through the doors.   Sat down and got down to business. Ordered a few beers and ate the following: bone marrow, scotch eggs with a masala crust topped with slaw, grilled octopus, iberico pork, chorizo iberico, and fried chicken. The star items for me: fried chicken, the iberico pork, and grilled octopus. When I head back..I'll slide the ribeye in there somewhere. Nice place. There are only a handful of late night joints you can stroll into without any worry for the quality of food late. Of note was the extensive drink menu which requires a more thorough visitation..Next time!   Ps edit: fried chicken is still the best in the city. And they also have the best dessert in the city. Basque cake. Add foie gras. And welcome to heaven. The sour ice cream is also very very good."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel reminds me of the small tapas bars in Barcelona and surely, the food does as well :)   Appetizers: - Sobrassada, Foie Gras & Honey Montadito: This is so delicious.. The foie gras was grated on top of the flatbread. It was very sweet, very yummy! - Roast Bone Marrow: The portion was larger than we've expected - the cholesterol tasted amazing hahaa  Mains: - Sea Bream Ceviche: It has a lemon-y taste to it - mixed with avocado & fresh fish - Grilled Octopus: Must try!   Desserts: - Corn Ice cream, Spicy Caramel, Walnut Crumble: I would order this over and over again.. Loved the sweet corn flavour!! IT'S SO GOOD :D"}
{"text":"A solid 4.5  I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, and finally came here with a friend for her (belated) birthday celebration.  I called on a Monday to make a reservation for Wednesday and was surprised that the only times available for 2 people were at 6pm or 10pm!  I ended up making a reservation for the bar (full menu available) for 8pm.  Once I got there I wasn't surprised.  The space is somewhat small, so it would fill up quickly.  Sitting at the bar was perfectly fine though.  They have a coat check - which is nice in a small place, especially in the winter with all of the bulky attire.  The decor was great, the ambience lively and the music, kind of old timey and fun.  While it was somewhat loud due to the compact nature of the place, and the number of people it wasn't so loud that you had to scream at your dinner mate.    In terms of service, I would have to say that this is probably the best staffed restaurant I've been too.  Everybody that passes by acknowledges  you, says hello or goodnight, asks you if you need anything, fills up your water, brings your food or takes your plates and helps you with your check.  You don't have to wait for anything (except  your food, which comes out as it's made).  The staff were not only friendly but incredibly knowledgeable about the food, the wine and pairings.  I was thoroughly impressed.    Now the part you've all be waiting for, the food!  While I was generally impressed with the food, there was a bit of room for improvement.  We ordered the rib-eye which came out a little cooler than I expected and while I know rib-eyes have marbled fat, there was a massive piece of fat on one of the slices.  The cheese plate was delicious (they let you pick the cheeses).  The patatas were a good suggestion from our waiter to go with the steak.  The sourdough bread and olive oil, simple yet delicious.  And the croquettes were tasty, but a bit mushier inside than I expected.  The ones I've had in Spain had more jambon chopped up inside.  The dessert, I forget what it was called but it was recommended by one of the servers since it has been on the menu since day 1.  It's some sort of buttery cake, almost like shortbread with warm sherry cream.  It was to die for.  I wish I had 10 of them.  No wonder it's been on the menu for so long!  The only other complaint would be that I wish there were a few more options on the menu (especially if you don't like seafood).  That being said, I know it can be hard to have a humongous menu for the kitchen, so perhaps it's a tactical thing.      I would absolutely come back here again and cannot wait until I do."}
{"text":"My boyfriend called a month in advance to make reservations for our anniversary dinner. He did not find the phone conversation very pleasant. The person that he spoke to said that they only had a 6:00pm reservation available (WHAT! My bf called a month in advance!!! I was shocked to hear this) My bf felt like the person gave attitude when he asked if there were reservations available after 6:00pm.   When we went into Bar Isabel, we found the place nicely decorated. The atmosphere was casual yet chic. The place was not packed when we went - a lot of tables were still vacant, but after 30 mins of seating, most of the seats were filled. The music was extremely loud so it was definitely hard to have a conversation without having to shout.   We ordered:  Marinated Sardine Montadito ($6) - this was okay. A bit salty, but I liked that the bread was soft. Even with the sardine on it, the bread was not soggy. (B)  Grilled Asparagus, Chorizo Verde, Tomatillo, Marcona Almonds & Mahon Sauce ($14) - this was one of our fave dishes. The asparagus was grilled to perfection, the sausages were delicious, and the sauce was heavenly. (A+)  Sobrassada Foie Gras & Honey Montadito ($6)- This was okay. The honey overpowered the foie gras taste. (B)  1/2 Grilled Octopus ($34) - the octopus was very tasty and tender. It took awhile to chew, but was cooked well. The end of the tentacles were nice and crunchy. The leafy vegetable looked like chinese broccoli. I didn't like the way it was prepared. It tasted very bitter and sour. (A-)  Bincho-Grilled Iberico Pork Presa (Served Rare), Scallions, Espellete Butter Sauce ($24) - Our waiter recommended this because this is the most popular pork dish in Spain and it was from the shoulder part of the pig. We have never had pork rare so this was a first for us. This was both our fave dish. The pork was marinated in a lovely butter sauce and pairing it with the scallions (long green onion) was a very nice touch. The green onions were grilled so it produced a sweetness when paired with the pork. (A+)  Aside: Toronto star just came out with an article ( day after we ate the pork) saying that eating rare pork could be dangerous if not cooked right. Only black hoof and bar Isabel serves rare pork. We feel ok, but definitely be aware of the potential risk. We wish we knew before ordering so we could have made an informed choice.   To read article:  http://read.thestar.com/?origref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.ca%2F#!/article/539c3267ec069172800005cd-toronto-restaurants-flout-regulations-to-serve-raw-pork  Leche Frita & Salted Dulce de Leche ($7) - this was the best dessert EVER! It was basically a timbit with a sweet cream filling inside. (A+).  Howe Sound Lager, Dortmunder Lager ($7) - A nice fruity light beer.   Riesling, Norman Hardie, 2012 PEC, Ontario, Canada ($13) - nothing special.  Our bill came up to around $141 with tax and tip. The service was okay. We had several staff serve us. Our main waiter was so-so. He didn't really make any chit-chat with us, but did check on us several times to make sure we were okay. Our water was mostly filled and our napkins were always re-folded when we went to the washroom by other staff. We really liked the person that took our order (not our main waiter). He gave us a lot of good tips on what to order. He recommended that we get 5 dishes (plus dessert) to be full. He was right. Dessert was a mission for me to finish!   Overall, I give this place a A. Why not A+? Cus the call to make the reservation could have been better. That really left a sour taste in my bf's mouth despite enjoying the food."}
{"text":"This has gotta be one of the HOTTEST restos in Toronto right now...they're booking rezzies weeks in advance and when we arrived without one on a Saturday night at 11:30pm, the place was rammed and there was a steady stream of walk-ins. (Tip: they always accept walk-ins if you don't mind dining at the bar...just expect a wait-list.)  Having said all that, the two of us got lucky and scored a table within 10 minutes.  I've wanted to try this joint from notable chef Grant Van Gameren for awhile now.  Unfortunately, the experience missed the mark for me!  We tried:  Cheese Plate - the cheese was yummy (when is cheese not yummy??) but the selection was not varied at all...no soft or creamy cheeses, no blue. All tasted similar. Also, they literally just handed us a small plate of cheese...no crackers/crostini, no dollops of honeys or jams, no nuts or accoutrement. Just cheese slices. For $16 at a hot resto, I expected more. (Try the cheese plate at Skin & Bones as a reference point).  Fried Chicken - (FYI they only serve this after midnight!) the batter is amazing...it's impossibly crunchy and very well seasoned. For $13 you get 3 good-sized pieces. But the cook on the chicken was just okay....I wouldn't say it's my favourite fried bird in the city (try Harlem or Stockyards).  Tuna Tiradito - thinly sliced tuna with asian pear, celery, jalapeno, fried rosemary. This was very light and tasty, but for me, nothing mind-blowing.  Chorizo - one big-ass sliced sausage made with marinated escarole. Fine. Nothing too special.  I will say, the portions here are generous! Not at all like some similarly priced tapas joints (Torito, Patria). The above order was too much food for two! We couldn't finish it all. Although we did enjoy a few slices of homemade sourdough with olive oil and salt before the meal, so maybe that's what did it :)  Overall I'd rate my experience a solid 3/5. Onto the next hot resto!"}
{"text":"I didn't get a table, but I didn't reserve and walked in on a busy Saturday night. Enjoyed my dinner at the bar and it definitely did not bother me because the FOOD IS SO GOOD! The atmosphere is super cute! Order everything, it's all good!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Food is full of flavour, and well executed. The service is attentive and unpretentious and the vibe is relaxed and fun.   Keep up the good work! I've been sending all my friends here. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The ambience at Bar Isabel transports you to Barcelona with it's cozy and intimate setting. We didn't have a reservation and were seated at the bar. The menu is one page, but is packed with a variety of tapas. They recommend three dishes per person and we ordered the signature octopus, olives, tomato bread, chorizo verde, sobrasada foie gras, and leek mushroom almond. We left with a full stomach and happy heart. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"}
{"text":"Good restaurant to experience but I am skeptical of the high ratings. I visited the restaurant last night due to all the hyped up review for my friend's birthday dinner.  - The sobrasada foie gras is indeed quite tasty.  - The octopus is also good but I don't find it much better than other places that offers similar dish.  -  I also find the bone marrow a bit fatty and not as well done comparing to Bestellen's. Very good services and interesting asmostphere is a plus. Overall I think it's definitely a good restaurant to check out but don't be overhyped because you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a very nice experience at Bar Isabel.  Came here late night after work.  I love the red atmosphere of this place.  The wait staff was very nice and had great recommendations on both food and drink. Great vegetarian options, the greens were actually so tasty ... get them with bread and you'll be all set.  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Food was good but our waiter was way too pushy and passive aggressive  with the fact that we were there for drinks and snacks 5 à 7 style and didn't order everything off the menu. Guy needs to chill."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this review with the O-word: Over-hyped.  Bar Isabel has quite the crazy buzz right now, and some of it is well-deserved, but it's also not totally with merit.  We did a walk-in (which means arriving 15 minutes before they open and waiting in line).  Got a nice table though in a very hipster-ish restaurant.  The FOOD:  First of all it is expensive and inconsistent.  We loved a dish served with chicken gizzards that was delicious and flavorful, but desperately needed to be served with bread to sop up the sauce.    The half grilled octopus had moments of greatness, but left a lot to be desired.  The weird thing about it is that means that in order to cook the thick central parts fully that the outer parts of the tentacles were super over-cooked and hard.  Maybe it was just our entree, because others rave about it, but I was on the disappointed side...especially after spending $34.  They're making a killing on this dish!  The DRINKS:  They've got a good cocktail menu.  We thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails, but they are pricey....$14-$16.  Ouch.  I did especially enjoy the Bicycle Thief cocktail.  Nice to see some decent beers on tap, too at $8-$10 a pint.  We didn't try wine by the glass here. 5 stars fo cocktail quality.    The SERVICE: It's hipster for sure, but was fairly good.  A few odd waits.  They really could have been a bit more helpful at times in describing the preparation of the dishes...we were a bit surprised at times.  Friendly though, a solid 4 stars.  Overall, I have to say that this place is a mixed bag.  Some of the food was great, some of it wasn't...all of it was expensive.  They've raised their prices a lot as the buzz has spread, and now they're pushing Michelin Star territory.  Unfortunately, this is still not Michelin star quality.  2 cocktails each and 3 dishes put us around the $150 mark for 2 people with tax and tip, so this is not a value proposition."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their lovely tasting menu here tonight and every dish was delicious. They are incredibly thoughtful in asking about dietary restrictions, favourite dishes from the menu and take all that information in to create a dining experience for you. It was amazing how they transformed simple ingredient such as their toast with tomato sauce into savoury dishes that made me want more. Their octopus was cooked to perfection with a lovely grilled flavour. Their cured meats, cheese and bread were delicious. Their sea bream ceviche was refreshing, lots of lime flavour with creamy guacamole. They gave a generous amounts of food for $67 per person (the range is generally $60-80 per person). Lastly, their chocolate sorbet, creamy and had a hit of citrus with basil. Amazing! Service was attentive and looked after even the small details such as clearing crumbs and used dishes. The environment is intimate and perfect for date night or dinner with friends. Will definitely stop by again!"}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is 4.5 stars. I give it five instead of four simply because I had some brilliant food here. It lives up to the En Route recognition better than any place off of the list in the past few years. Here are a few highlights:  1. The drinks are excellent and very expensive. Expect to pay 14-17$ each. They have a well-crafted bar menu to suit your preferences. Expect creative originals, as well as classic cocktails. 2. The clam and lobster soup dishes easily set the standard here. They are simply delicious without being too salty. 3. The octopus is a winner. 4. The fried chicken (served late at night) is greasy and just a bit off. 5. Desserts are delicious. Had I not been so stuffed, I would have ordered another round. 6. Service is good, especially for a hip, loud place that gets loads of business already. 7. Food service can bog down a bit once it gets late. That being said, it is nice to be able to eat a delicious meal after a concert, game, etc.  Well worth it."}
{"text":"Good delicious comfort food for upper-ish prices, depending on your annual income. Ambiance is great. Food is delicious. Wait times - not so much. Always call ahead and see what you can do!"}
{"text":"Finally found a place that has a great atmosphere and drinks!  We came here mostly for drinks, but also sampled the chorizo octopus skewers... and they were delicious. If the rest of their menu tastes this good, I mah have found my new fav go to place!  Ps. Came here around 12am on a Friday and while there were seats available the place was totally jiving."}
{"text":"The food is just as good as it gets. I love the bone marrow and beef carpaccio here and I get them every single time. the only thing I don't recommend is the shishito peppers. they're too big and don't taste good. other than that everything is amazing. I also tried the ceviche last time that was amazing and loved it. definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"Grabbed a seat at the bar, ordered a perfectly prepared Negroni and perused the menu. Shared whole fish ceviche, oysters, beer battered perch, spot prawns, basque cake and celery panna cotta.  Oysters: briny and lovely.  Beer battered perch: golden brown and delicious, topped w/ green onions, spicy mayo and jalapenos. Crunchy and flavorful w/ just enough heat to remind you it's spicy.  Whole fish ceviche: chunks of fish marinated in lime w/ chunks of rich, smooth avocado to cut the acid. Just order it, it's amazing.  BC spot prawns: off-menu special was cooked on a bed of smoking wood chips. The heads were flavorful and the tails were smooth, barely cooked, sweet and served w/ clarified butter and gray sea salt. Another standout.  Basque cake w/ sherry cream: Served warm, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. It's a good traditional dessert.  Buttermilk panna cotta w/ celery and buckwheat crumble: This was less traditional, but still a standout. Be prepared, it's celery flavored and tart w/ the crumble providing a textural and sweet contrast.  tl;dr: The food has flavor. It's not salty, it's actually flavorful. That's not surprising considering the chef's time at Ad Hoc. Throw in excellent cocktails, and you got yourself a winner."}
{"text":"@BarIsabel797 #DINNERTO #FRESHBABYOCTO #TORONTOTAPAS #YELPTO  Eat. Drink. Be Merry. This place is top-notch! And I rarely ever comment on branding, but this place has done something special - it's small, intimate, neon-lit yet upscale. And surprisingly, Bar Isabel has placed itself on the online grid with a great website and active social media.   And the food. God! The food. Possibly Toronto at it's finest! The tapas are absolutely exquisite. Here's what we tried:   Chips, Boquerones, Piquillo & Jalapeño: Basically, fresh anchovies with peppers and jalapeño, served with doritos-like chips. This is a MUST TRY item.  Roast Bone Marrow: My first time having roasted beef bone marrow on bread and it tastes great!   Shishito Peppers: This is supposedly a hit too. Now, I am not fond of peppers so I can't say much about it.   Grilled Octopus: Another first, this did not disappoint. I always expected octopus to be tougher - but this was tender, lobster-like but better. I can't wait to go back for some more.   We also ordered a cheese plate and a cured meat plate. And of course, cocktails and wine which were just as good as the shareable platters. Watch out for the cocktail menu and the dessert drinks - I'm yet to come across something this exotic and varied.  The prices can be on the higher end for many - I found it reasonable because the food, drinks and service were so very perfect! #definitelycomingback"}
{"text":"Still a fan of their menu. Went for a late bite after the OTR concert the other night.   Ordered the staple pickled plate. Good as expected. Tried the asparagus with chorizo that is not a chorizo but a different sausage type. Sausage could have been cooked a bit more well done.  Mushroom an peas were yummy. Calamari was delicious if you are a fan of this that is more flavourful and with a bit of sauce dressed with it. I like typical fried calamari served everywhere with a wedge of lemon, but this is a good alternate.  Service - he was polite to an extent. By the time we asked for the dessert menu it was about 12:15am. He was happy to get us a menu but he would end up visiting 6 other tables, pouring water, clearing it, bows  his head acknowledging he remembers the menu before going to his bus station. It was an uncomfortable long wait (despite it wasn't that long). Closing isn't till 2am but you can tell he just wants to clean up so closing tasks would be quick when it clears out. We lost our appetite and left  after a quick look at the menu when it finally made its way to the table."}
{"text":"Got reservations this past weekend for a Sunday night double date with beloved Toronto friends. I had been looking forward to coming here since my sweet man friend had told me he wanted to bring me, and I really wanted to have a nice night bringing people I love together, and I couldn't have been happier with the food and service we were treated to at this lovely restaurant. It's casual but you can dress up, it's dim and sexy and cool but elegant, old and new styles in harmony, lots of incredible meat and fish on the menu but a happy welcoming attitude to vegetarians of all kinds, amazing cocktails and wine list, everything brought out at a leisurely no stress but no awkward wait times pace... and all the food was deeply delicious."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel seems to have become the holy grail of Toronto restaurants, so obviously I was incredibly excited to try it and expectations could hardly have been higher. Long story short: It was very, very good, but not mind-blowing, unfortunately.  There were three of us, so we ordered quite a few items. One of the first things we ordered was the bread, which consisted of some crusty sourdough bread and a small dish of olive oil. The bread was definitely better than usual, but it was the olive oil that really knocked our collective socks off. We also ordered the olives, which were definitely pretty tasty but nothing life changing.  Up next was the salumi plate, which came with a few different kinds of cured meats. I will admit these were all really spectacular, especially the chorizo. We also ordered a plate of 14 Arpents cheese, which ultimately turned out to be the highlight of the night for me personally. It's a smooth, creamy, and just addictive soft cheese. I've since bought some separately from a specialty cheese shop.  The Anchovy & Crème Fraiche was next and again, this was very good but not great. The crème fraiche was kind of bland and tasteless, and it somehow managed to overwhelm the single anchovy. Likewise, the tartar did nothing to separate itself from the countless other variations on this dish I've had over the years.  The Jamón Croquetas, on the other hand, were pretty much perfection. They arrived piping hot and the cheesy, gooey filling was delectable. These were followed by the Patatas Bravas w/ Boquerones & Morcilla, and this might've been the most disappointing dish of the night. The potatoes were extremely generic and a few were even undercooked. The blood sausage was admittedly quite good, at least.  The centerpiece of the meal was the much-lauded Half Octopus. It was served in a dish overflowing with a tomatoey, garlicky sauce that was incredibly tasty. But the octopus itself, plentiful as it was, was a complete letdown. It was irredeemably chewy in parts, especially around the thick base, and wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped.  The meal ended on a high note with the Basque Cake, however, as this was probably one of the tastiest desserts I've eaten in a long time.  Look, I know I'm nitpicking but there's just so much hype around this place. Plus I wound up spending close to $300 (!!!) so I was expecting something much, much more revelatory than what I got."}
{"text":"One of the best in the city for service. If you go and skip on the Basque cake, you've failed at life."}
{"text":"their bone marrows are HUGE and delicious! they give a couple slices of toast but have no trouble providing you more when you ask.  service is mediocre. come to this place for nothing else but the food.  also had the ribeye that was cooked perfectly as well.  book reservations 3+ weeks in advance! very busy place"}
{"text":"Meh all around...   We arrived around 11:15, right before the transition from the regular dinner menu to the late-night, shorter version. We ordered off the regular menu, which may have had something to do with the lack of quality of the food.   We had a dozen oysters, bone marrow with a chimichurri sauce, fleur de sel, and toast, a vegan \"no-show\" salad, and half a cornish hen. We also tried a ceasar, which was bland, and one of their signature cocktails, the hopeless mermaid, which was tasty but lacked elderflower flavour.   The best part of the meal was the vegan no-show salad. The oysters, cornish hen and bone marrow were all underwhelming. For the price, I expected more.   The staff was friendly, although they did ask us 3 times whether we had allergies at the table and tried to clear our plates a few times with considerable amounts of food still on them.  Would I return? Probably not."}
{"text":"There are times in cuisine where an experience can be so exquisite as to merit a gushing review and I enjoyed a leisurely evening at Bar Isabel that much. Three things stood out. The server was genuinely interested to give us the best dining experience. The first question for wine was \"how adventurous are you\" and taking a leap of faith resulted in a beautiful white wine that opened and pleased the palate more as it warmed. Thirdly, there were two noteworthy dishes. The octopus was perfectly grilled, moist and succulent and the quails were butterflied and finger licking worthy. Definitely will return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Toronto my fiance and I dined at the highly recommended Bar Isabel, which we thoroughly enjoyed, would recommend, and intend to visit again in the near future.  When we first walked in we felt at home, the decor and ambiance make you feel like you are at home or at least at a home of a relatives where you dine in complete comfort. We dined at the bar with no wait when we arrived however we strongly suggest a reservation if you plan to dine at this delicious spot.   The bartender Josh was a highlight of our experience. He was kind, helpful, funny, attentive, and took great care of us without intruding on our dining experience.  The hostess was also warm, friendly, and inviting, taking our coats and having them ready and waiting for us when we had finished dining.  Both of the cocktails we enjoyed were delicious, I had the Baraganna which was not overly sweet had a nice lingering heat and good overall flavor. For food we enjoyed the wild mushrooms with lentil which started off amazing! I instantly loved this dish, however a word of caution, as the dish sat the mushrooms became slimy, gobble this one up as soon as it hits your table. Perhaps if the mushrooms were crisp and pan fried they would have kept their integrity a little longer, but I can not say for certain. Also, as we enjoyed this dish the acid/vinegar became slightly overwhelming, again when we first began eating this dish was one of the best things I had ever tasted, the acid just wore on my palate. The Smoked Sweetbreads with Raw Tuna, Persimmon & Brown Butter was also amazing!!!!! The richness of the sweetbreads played interesting with the leanness of the Tuna and the brown butter and persimmon were simply delicious. Highly recommend this dish. Lastly we enjoyed the Seared Foie Gras, Morcilla & Apple Mostarda also a wonderful dish, the mostarda was sweet and hot and still had some of the apple texture that the creamy foie gras needed. Next time we go back we will be trying the octopus which the gentleman next to us moaned over, it looked like potentially the best octopus of my life, recommended based on look, smell, menu description, and the moaning of the gentleman next to us.  Great place, good food and drink, great service, feels like you are at home, what more could you want?"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is spot on.  If you're looking for an intimate and playful experience with food and drinks to match this is the spot."}
{"text":"Reservations are highly recommended..They start booking for weekends at least 2 months in advance and weekdays at least 3 weeks in advance!!  We ordered the $65pp tasting menu. Man, what a treat!  Right off the bat, the service is FLAWLESS. One poster below commented on the wine pouring and YES I can attest to this. They also accommodate ANY dietary restrictions or preferences. We had a baby with us and fully accommodated us with no hassle. Amazing service is always greatly appreciated - and noticed!  We only commented on our favourite dishes to shorten this Yelp review! Don't get us wrong, every dish was FANTASTIC but as always, some stick out more than others.   Our meal consisted of (prices are off menu but our servings were much larger as it was a tasting menu for 11 people):  - 48 OYSTERS - HOUSEMADE BREAD ($4) WITH OLIVES ($5) - MANCHEGO CHEESE ($7)  - LOMO IBERICO ($9) & JAMON IBERICO ($50) The prized Jamon Iberico, a type of cured ham made from black Iberian pigs that are fed an acorn diet for 75% of their life. We were informed that ours was fed acorns for three years! It is an experience in itself to eat. Such a delicious balance of lean pork marbled with fat that quickly dissolves in your mouth. There is a very distinct nuttiness from the acorn diet that is slightly sweet as well. Such a delicacy does not come cheap however.. A plate of Jamon Iberico costs $50 and up!  - BOQUERONES WITH JALAPENOS AND PIQUILLO PEPPERS ($9) Came with a basket of chips to eat with it. I didnt want the chips (I mean.. why waste stomach space?) but with this dish it is absolutely necessary. Everything added up and complimented each other so so well  - SWORDFISH TIRADITO ($15) A very nice follow-up. Raw slices of sword fish were covered with an sorrel and olive sauce. A light sprinkle of fresh sweet peas, smoked olives and crispy jamon topped the dish.  - WHOLE SEABREAM CEVICHE ($26) was a delight both visually and taste wise. The meat of the fish was used for the ceviche (fresh, well seasoned and great acidity!) while the exterior of the fish was flash fried which really makes it almost two dishes in one. Slivers of fried leeks that hide cubes of tender, tangy meat that is mixed with creamy avocado chunks  - SPICY FRIED SQUID ($8)  - PATATAS BRAVAS ($7) I am always skeptical about ordering any rendition of a potato in upscale restaurants. I mean , how hard or complex can it really get? But these were phenomenal. A great dish to munch on.   - GOOSENECK BARNACLES ($32)  - SEARED FOIE GRAS, MORCILLA, APRICOT JAM ($28) Seared foie gras was gingerly placed ontop of a morcilla blood sausage with a slab or apricot jam on the side. Now this just screams all sorts of \"What? Does this even work\" and I can assure you it does, it really really does. First off the blood sausage is unlike anything I've ever tasted - it was more creamy and mashed then a solid sausage. When paired with the soft foie gras and the sweet apricot jam, it's seriously  a bite of heaven.  - 18OZ CUMBRAE'S RIBEYE & CHIMICHURRI ($42)  - WHOLE OCTOPUS ($59..HALF SIZE IS $34) Finally, the moment I had been waiting for - Bar Isabel's famed octopus. The concept is deceptively simple but the execution was perfect. Tender, moist octopus that came with a huge kickass steak knife aggressively jabbed into the top and served over a bed of roasted dandelion greens and potatoes. The end of the tentacles are nice and crunchy and the dandelions were bitter but not overwhelmingly so. Loved it!  - BASQUE CAKE & SHERRY CREAM ($9)  This was delicious albeit a really rich dessert, so I definitely recommend sharing if you order this.  - LECHE FRITA & SALTED DULCE DE LECHE ($7) This was a delightful dessert - imagine a a crispy, moist small doughnut and when bit into, reveals a sweet salted dulce de leche filling.  All in all, it was truly an unforgettable experience. Their menu has something for everyone and was hugely enjoyed by everyone in my group (which ranged from ages 14 - 50+ !). The progression of the menu was flawless and the service was on point. Would return in a second :)!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best resto in Toronto. Went in Winter 2017 and had an amazing experience. Ceviche was amazing!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were in the area to pick up some purchased goods. We had some time to kill and she suggested we come in to Bar Isabel for a light dinner.  We came on a Wednesday evening - to find most seating reserved or filled. We ended up sitting at a 2-seater alcove bench by the entrance. It was satisfactory for some drinks and small plates.  To drink, I had the Dieu du Ciel (Rose D'Hibiscus, Belgian Wit). We shared a plate of Salumi and Cheese (the menu offers a salumi plate and a cheese plate separately, but they were accommodating when we requested half-and-half of each). We had an order of sourdough bread to go with.  Besides the Salumi/Cheese/Bread, we also had an order of Blistered Shishito Peppers with Sea Salt. These were delicious and you occasionally were gambling to see if you ended up picking up a hot and spicy one. For the most part, the majority of the peppers were not hot - and the way they were blistered, gave it a nice charred texture and softness to the peppers.   Overall - we truly only sampled a small portion of the menu. Based on what we had, I thought the food was generally good. I think if I have another opportunity to try more of their menu (namely the larger plates) then I may have stronger opinions of the cuisine."}
{"text":"Tempted by the recent \"Best New Restaurant in Canada\" ranking in 2013, I was very excited to try this place. I dutifully made my reservation almost 3 months in advance to ensure I would get a table on my preferred date.   We arrived at around 6:30pm on a weekday night to predictably find the place packed. As was noted in previous reviews, this place is LOUD, and is not suitable for a romantic date. I had heard about this before I made the booking and was expecting it to be loud, but how loud it actually turned out was pretty shocking. This can't be blamed on the restaurant itself, but it is definitely worth knowing before you go.   To start, we had the ceviche which was out of this world. The fish was so tender that it was scarcely distinguishable from the texture of the avocado when a full forkful was put into my mouth. As a whole, the dish simply had a delightful and balanced flavour, and was probably the best ceviche I've ever eaten. We both greedily shovelled the ceviche into our mouths, strategically opting for the biggest pieces left on the plate, casting threatening glares to each other as we got to the end of the dish with the objective of eating the more of coveted fish than the other.  Next we had the peppers, which were disappointing. The salt they used on the peppers was good, but the peppers themselves were tasteless and a bit tough. Nothing special stood out. In fact, I would call this dish quite bland and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.  Yes, it's true what you've heard: the bread is amazing. Contrary to conventional dietary wisdom of the day, I am an avid consumer of bread. I lived in France where fresh bread is sold in gas stations on the side of the highway, and have made an effort to try most of the best bakeries in Toronto. Surely, this bread is in the upper echelon of the best bread I've ever had, and is worth trying for the carb-crazed like myself.  Next, we had the imperial patatas bravas. The blood sausage was quite nice, and the overall flavour profile of the dish was \"good\", but I found the fried potatoes themselves to be a bit mealy. As this was the bulk of the dish, it affected our overall enjoyment of it. I would have quite enjoyed a dish like this at an average restaurant, but for a restaurant surrounded by all the hoopla caused by best in Canada rating last year, it fell a little short.   Lastly, we had the sweetbreads. Now, this is my first time ever having sweetbreads, and I am quite the adventurous eater. There is little I will say no to, and have quite the open mind. However, the sweetbreads' texture was just not something either of us found enjoyable. Further, they had a peculiar taste to it that we could just not get over. It's hard to describe, but that taste threw the whole dish off for us.   Although the ceviche and bread were amazing, most of our meal was at or below average which left us leaving a little disappointed. It just goes to show you the folly behind such a rating as the \"Best Restaurant in Canada, 2013\": these things are highly subjective, and it seems impossible to meaningfully rank all new restaurants in a country within a given year."}
{"text":"Walked in without a reso but they  managed to place us at a table (with a warning that reso holders would be arriving in 90 minutes to claim our table). Okay, fair enough. The appetizers we ordered were pretty salty and lackluster, so much so that I don't even remember what they were. Things were not looking great. But then our main dish arrived -- octopus with little pieces of chopped chorizo and a tiny pasta that seemed almost like couscous -- and this turned everything around! So amazing. I especially loved how the tips of the octopus tentacles were crispy on the outside.   Dessert felt a little rushed since we were approaching the end of our 90min table allotment, but the basque cake we ordered was so creamy and smooth and amazing that we gobbled it down in no time. There were some other things I wanted to try, like the absinthe with sugar cube, maybe if we had more time. Otherwise it was a good meal, lovely place, and our server was friendly."}
{"text":"What I love about BIFF is that we share the same love for culinary. Although we're both adventurous when it comes to trying new foods, I think I'm still a bit more reserved than she is when it comes to the more exotic foods.  I haven't tried anything new in a while so when we saw the Smoked Sweetbreads, Raw Tuna, Persimmon & Brown Butter dish on the menu, we jumped at it. Sweetbreads could mean a few different things. It could be either, brain, thymus glands, or pancreas. We didn't bother asking. But it happened to be our favorite dish on the menu! Since I've had heart before, wrapping my head around eating sweetbreads wasn't as hard. I mean, looking at it from an ethical POV, the heart is our life source. If it stops working, we be dead. Ya dig?  The Roast Bone Marrow was our second favorite dish. Soft, fatty, and just so good! Chinese people eat this all the time. So when the server suggested it to us as an adventurous dish, we had to giggle.  My least favorite dish was the Morcilla Scotch Egg, Hollandaise & Blonde Frisee. This was my first time trying hen's egg. The dish didn't really do anything for me. I thought it was bland and a bit dry.  And of course we ordered oysters. They were serving Village Bay that night which happens to be one of my favorites. So meaty!   Overall the food was amazing. The restaurant had that typical \"west-end\" look and atmosphere. I'm really starting to like College Street. A lot. I think it's beginning to branch away from the University hangout it used to be known as.

{"text":"I liked some dishes more than others. Ordered some of their famed dishes along with some of our server;s recommendations. I thought the dishes were a bit pricey but since this place is so hyped up, maybe it's worth it.   When the food started trickling in, we started digging in. I think the best tasting dishes we tried were the grilled octopus and the morcilla and fois gras. Also loved the basque cake! Yummy! Didn't care as much for their bone marrow, and cured meat plate was average, nothing special.   The atmosphere is interesting. Don't know how to describe it. It's casual, hip, and very dark, hard to read anything at all. They limited our seating time to two hours because this place is so popular but we were done before then. It comes to about $50 pp after tax and tip which isn't too bad. But considering how small the plates were and how we probably filled up on the three orders of bread, we would have done more damage to the wallet had we gotten more dishes.   I think you can try to visit just to try out some Spanish tapas. But don't come here believing the hype because you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good.    I definitely had my doubts walking in the door.   Generally well-timed hype is more due to a good public relations person than excellent food.    One of the better casual places in a town full of great casual places.  The Octopus + Sausage dish was spectacular.    As was the amazing pepper dish where some of the look-alike peppers were sweet and some were hot....  it was like playing Russian Roulette with food.   Really imaginative.   Really fun.   Really delicious.  One of our dining companions almost had an orgasm over the fried chicken.     Smart menu.   Great food.   Almost makes you forget that you're in the heart of the bridge-and-tunnel mess that is College street on a saturday night."}
{"text":"My sister and her fiance invited me out for dinner when they were in town. Apparently reservations are needed at least two weeks in advance, but we lucked out and there was a last minute cancellation. As other reviews have recommended, we had a table towards the back. From the outside, Bar Isabel is very unassuming; I passed it a couple of times before realizing that this place was it. The vibe is good; it's dimly lit inside with an old school look. BI kept everything for the vintage look. Service was excellent; everyone was well dressed in their own unique style. Again, as others have mentioned, this place was well staffed. Now on to the food. It's a Spanish tapas restaurant so the menu is small, but manages to have something for every pallet. My recommendation would be the octopus. It was in a tomato broth with generous portions of chorizo sausage. I really enjoyed this dish. We also ordered a cheese and meat plate along with twelve oysters (the chopped up jalapeno is a nice touch). The drink menu is also quite extensive ranging from wines, champagnes, and Spanish beers.  Good for: tapas, drinks, groups  NB - Reservations need to be made well in advance."}
{"text":"Definitely a trendy spot to chill at Bar Isabel. Atmosphere was casual yet had a fine dining-feel to it, as the waiters would fold our napkins whenever one of us went to use the restroom. Music was good and the crowd was very mixed from students to families to young and elderly couples. It was somewhat loud as people usually go there as a place to socialize. Also, don't expect to have a private or quiet conversation as the tables are seated quite close to each other.  The food was great. There were two of us and initially we ordered four dishes, but then ended up ordering two more afterward. We ordered the following dishes (and it came in this order):  1) Fried squid (7.5/10) 2) Sweetbreads (8/10) 3) Ceviche (8/10) 4) Grilled asparagus and chorizo (8.5./10) 5) Scotch egg with chorizo (7/10) 6) Caramelized onion flatbread (4/10)  Several of their dishes have a highly acidic (e.g., marinated in lime juice) component to them so it would be good to try a bit of each dish here and there vs. finishing a whole dish first. I wish we had done that, but they seem to bring out one dish at a time every several minutes.  Bar Isabel is a place I'd return to for a special occasion with a group so that I can try a bit of everything; however, I find that it is overpriced for what it's worth. For two, including a beer and a glass of Riesling, the bill came to $124 including taxes."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. Best food. Best ambience. Best atmosphere. This place has it all. Not even crazy expensive, even with the overly generous tip we just had to give our server.   The octopus was all it was cracked up to be. And the chips with anchovies was surprisingly decadent. I could go on and on about this dinner."}
{"text":"While there is nothing inherently wrong with Bar Isabel, I would say the hype does not live up to the experience.  The decor is cool but the seating is uncomfortable. There is nothing wrong with the food, but it doesn't go the extra step needed to satisfy. Furthermore, I had ordered olives, croquetta & the octopus which all had very similar spice bases so I felt like they all tasted the same. Tapas in my opinion should not be so similar, as you are expected to eat several of these dishes during one meal. Furthermore, the menu isn't huge, so the choices should have more creativity and flare to differentiate.  Despite this, the cocktails did not disappoint. They are delicious and a must have."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Bar Isabel ever since I paid a visit to the Black Hoof.  I feel like it would've wowed me more if I wasn't so impressed by the Black Hoof, but this is no question one of the foodie gems in Toronto regardless  Ambiance: I love the way this resto looks and feels.  The decor, the plates.  Mucho amor.    Service:  Servers made sure I was never thirsty and let us keep a wrong plate of food that they accidentally served us.  :)  Wish we had one server throughout though, but they were all so pleasant :)  They dressed to match the resto's decor too, makes the experience all the better  FOOD Got the special of the day for my drink, a margarita of some sort that I liked because it was not too sweet but not too strong either, vodka-based, think it was kinda peachy.  Mhmm.   Bread - .......LOL.  Not sure why some of the reviews I read as I was ordering talked about bread.  Nothing special really...  Pan Con Tomate - The dish we didn't order but got to try - tomato-y breads.  Crispy and flavourful, pretty good not outstanding.  Spicy Oyster Esabeche, Whitefish Roe & Dill - AMAZING.  These two pieces of oysters were the best oysters I've ever had.  Foodgasm.  Is it really just whitefish roe and dill?  Tasted like a whole kitchen of delicious to me.    Patatas Bravas - Imperial - Of course we'd get the imperial.  Has blood sausage and jalapeno, loved these taters.  A more filling dish and a good addition to your Bar Isabel meal    Pan Con Jamon Iberico de Bellota - Best cured meat I've had.  Apparently brings you back to Spain, but this is just better than any store-bought cured meat I've ever had.    Smoked Sweetbreads, Raw Tuna, Pickled Green Tomatoes & Brown Butter - Alright.. I admit I didn't know what sweetbreads were before ordering this dish.  I assumed it was tuna on sweet breads ... but they are throat or pancreas of lamb or calf..  I'm sorry, this was a much raved dish among Yelpers but it just tasted a bit strange to me.  Tuna was VERY good, smooth fresh, but overall... the sweetbreads didn't do it for me.    Basque Cake & Sherry Cream - .........I usually am not a big fan of cakes.  In fact, I avoid ordering cakes whenever I go to a nice resto for dessert, and always go for a crumble or pie.  But this was the creamiest smoothest and probably the best dessert I had at any resto.  It was covered with a milk custard and the combination of the basque cake (made with almond flour) and sherry cream was just perfection.  Save this for a special occasion and book a month in advance, but definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"do not put everything they do under a microscope. do not concern yourself over whether or not you're getting absolute value for every bite. just, like, go and eat good food and eat dat ceviche and savour it and get in on those razor clams if they're there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this meal. Ate here as a group of 5, sat at a table in the back corner that was really nice. We had our server come up with a pescatarian tasting menu based on our price range (if I remember correctly was $50/person), plus accommodating a peanut allergy. Very good value, we managed to try quite a few dishes and they were all delicious. Tasting menu would probably not be suitable for picky eaters (between what looked like an entire octopus and later an entire fish on a serving platter) but there are lots of options if ordering a la carte."}
{"text":"I was waiting to see what Grant van Gameren's next project would be, and Bar Isabel met and surpassed my expectations. I came here with a couple of girlfriends and we had a great time. The food is amazing, whatever you order, we tried several dishes (be adventurous!!). The drinks were also great, original and good quality. The basque cake was delicious! Let's talk about the building now, the décor and ambiance truly make you feel like you're in a different part of the world. From the tiles on the floor, to the furniture, every detail seems carefully considered. The service is very attentive and courteous. It does get busy, but fortunately you can make reservations. I can't say enough good things about this place. If you are a true foodie, you must try it."}
{"text":"Hard to find uglier place then this!!! Was there one time at night ( heard a lot of good revies about Bar Isabel from my friends) Prices are crazy high for such place. Servies is awful- the waiter met  his friends at the bar and started to drink whiskey with them.after that 1 min later came to us and ask what we wanna order smelling alcohol like crazy!!!! we ordered sparkling water and choosed food. after 5 min he bring other bottle of water( that we did not order) already opened and starts to pure.I was shocked with this serives. Finally we just stand up and leave cause in the hall some crazy young girls  started to behave like monkeys and it was impossible to stay there anymore..  never recommend such place to anyone!!! never"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday drink on a Friday night and to share some appetizers for a group of 4. One reason we wanted to check out the place is that our birthday girl is also named Isabel so it was the perfect place! Bar Isabel has Spanish-influenced dishes and it is definitely on the pricier side. We made a reservation a week prior but it looked like we didn't need to as it was surprisingly dead on a Friday night. My friend and I attempted to go last year but it was far too packed. The decor is nice, round marble tables, wooden tables along with beautiful floors and a clean washroom.   Our group had no issue with the food, although we weren't entirely satisfied with our drinks as they were ridiculously expensive for something basic, it was nothing to fret over which is why I'm giving this place a 3/5. I'm writing this review because the service was awful.  This bar generally attracts an older crowd who probably have a lot of money to tip. When they saw a group of 20 year olds walk in, it looked like they were disappointed and not happy to see us. When we were seated, I couldn't help but notice many of the servers staring at our table and to be honest, it made me uncomfortable. It took us a while to order since we were really indecisive. We decided on some glasses of champagne and one of the refreshing cocktails with a cured meat plate with a side of bread to share. Our drinks and food came quick and all was well, but our server was very stand off-ish with us. The place was slow, but I think that's all the more reason for your servers to connect with the guests that are there. Maybe our server had a bad day,  but she had a blank face all through out and did not bother to recommend anything or wish our friend a happy birthday. She was not friendly at all.  It seems like Bar Isabel judges their guests based on appearance and what our income class looks like. I'm sure we have all experienced employees who pay extra attention to the people who look \"rich\" than the people who look normal because they think the rich will buy more and tip more. This mentality is incredibly stupid and it definitely steered me away from purchasing anything else. Sometimes the \"normal\" people want to purchase more or try more things but this stupid judgment prevents that. I am more than happy to tip well if I receive quality service but this place really disappointed me. I really hope that the establishment reads their Yelp reviews and comes across this one so the servers can learn to become less judgmental."}
{"text":"I have been to Bar Isabel twice and both experiences were fabulous.  I brought large groups both times and the chef's menu was amazing. There were so many delicious dishes, I only wish we hadn't filled up on the earlier courses because we were too stuffed to fully enjoy the final courses. Great value, excellent service, creative and delicious cocktails.  Bar Isabel is in my top 5 in Toronto. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend Tammi and was blown away by the quality of the food. She couldn't stop talking about the jicama salad, so of course I had to try it. It was excellent. So good in fact, that I've been talking about it in the weeks since I dined here. Just when I felt like I got talking about the jicama salad out of my system, I was in Mexico with some friends and we had a jicama salad. Needless to say, it paled in comparison to the one at Bar Isabel. Now, does anyone want to play catch in the ocean?"}
{"text":"The service was excellent from the discreet clearing of dishes to the refilling of water.  Our waiter was very helpful in recommending dishes that complement each other.  Two of us shared 9 dishes (2 of them were half orders).  We're not big eaters so this was too much food; we probably could've done with just 6 or 7 but we wanted to try a good variety.  We didn't have room for dessert :(.  The bone marrow was excellent, as were the mussels and bread with olive oil.  The reason I don't give this 5 stars is because some of the dishes were good, but not extraordinary.  This place is definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar birthday meal from start to finish. Must try the Canadian Absinthe experience."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this new trendy resto from previous reviews and the pedigree of it's origins. I was however, disappointed by the food.   The decor is warm and friendly although the noise level was deafening until about 10 pm when it slightly got quieter. Warm wood, cute light fixtures, very Spanish tapas feel. 5 stars on decor - well, 4 because of noise.  But I don't eat decor. I eat food. I was thrilled to find out it was a Spanish tapas place as I have a second home in Spain and thought the chance to have those dishes close to home would be sweet. The menu options met my expectations - the drinks and wine were very good. But again...the actual food...  There were 4 of us so we were able to try a number of dishes.  1. Oysters - were good. Although my friend got a bad one which turned her off. 2. Mojama (tuna) with red onion, macademia nuts, some citrus - ok. Tuna was a bit fishy and too much room temperature. We didn't even finish it. 3. Potatas Braavos - grown up tater tots. Not bad, but not amazing. 4. Chick pea and chard - one of the better dishes - nice spices, chick peas had a bit of hard on the outside, soft on the inside which was good. 5. Whole fish Sea Bream Ceviche - a big disappointment. I don't know what it is with Canadians and avocado in their ceviche. That might be a personal thing but hey, it's my review. The fish was pretty good - again a bit on the warm side.  6. Asparagus with flax seeds and hollandaise was pretty delicious.  7. Fried chicken - I didn't partake as I don't eat meat but the other 3 ladies thought it was just OK. 8. Hanger steak and peppers - again I didn't partake and the other 3 thought it was overcooked a bit and they didn't finish it. 9. Beer battered bass - pretty tasty actually but quite small so if you order it for more than one person perhaps get two!   Sure I would try it again - once is almost never enough with a new place but I think i might prefer sitting at the bar eating a couple of dishes more than going for dinner. Price was pretty decent - all that food, 4 cocktails and a bottle of wine for $300.  Recommend reservations. And its not a first date ideal setting because of the noise. Unless you're trying to impress your date with a new hot spot, this definitely qualifies. Sadly, the food didn't measure up."}
{"text":"We dined with Bar Isabel for our 1-year anniversary. We were very excited as we were flying in from Houston and Alberta to see each other (long distance currently). The ambience was lovely, warm and cozy. The food was a major disappointment.   Between my wife and I, we started with the olives and garden pickles which were good. We then tried the cheese plate, which wasn't impressive at all. We have found fresher products at Whole Foods and other such places.   We then proceeded to try the Patatas Bravas and Shishito Peppers. Patatas Bravas was good, nothing great. The Shishito Peppers was a major disappointment. Flavorless. We then ordered Foie Gras, hoping for some reconciliation. Disappointed again. The texture was on point, but the taste was off. I had to wash it down with a glass of water.   To top it all off, I got charged $150 for 9 roses that I had requested. The manager was courteous about it when discussed. However, when he saw the $150 charge, he apologised and said it was a mistake and the roses were only $50. Mistakes happen, no issues. However, a courteous gesture of offering to rectify that mistake beyond taking off the extra $100, would have been highly appreciated. We expected more from a place of this calibre and reputation.  Overall, great ambience, good service, but food isn't as good as it used to be anymore - spoke to some friends who've been here a few times and they had similar experiences.   Disappointing!"}
{"text":"I loved Bar Isabel. It achieves what I think all good restaurants strive for -- a total experience that's unforgettable. The vibe in the resto was infectious. The cocktails strong and tasty. The staff, friendly, charming and, gotta say, pretty sexy.  But, we went for the food and man did we get some goddamn tasty food. We were a party of 2 seated at the bar. We had the cheese plate and salumi plate to start. Then the sardine crostini followed by the amazing grilled octopus. We closed with the king crab legs -- all washed down with a nice bottle of Rioja. My only regret was not getting the ceviche.  A meal at Bar Isabel will make you want to quit your job immediately and go in search of the good life.   The place was bumpin' for a Tuesday night and will only get busier now that it's been named Canada's top restaurant by En Route magazine. Reservations are hard to come by. My recommendation - go as a small group as a walk-in and put ur name down for a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"For my parents anniversary we went here.    Pros: +Really tasty food +Bring your own wine (25$ uncorking charge)  Cons: - small locale - very small portions  The place is pretty crowded and really loud.  Some could consider this cozy.  (It was not uncomfortable, but a bit more room would have been nice)  The portions are really small, we need up ordering 4 portions (including the steak and half an octopus) and 2 appetizers.  At the end of the meal we were full but not stuffed.  The total cost was 200 before tax.   I would def recommend the steak.  Everything else we got was tasty (a dew dishes were a bit sour)  but nothing that was a must have.    Service: Great service, the main waitress was there whenever we needed her, but not annoying, and did not inturupt us during our meal.  During the meal, a couple other ppl came to clean up our plates and refill the water without disrupting our conversation.    Would go there again with a small group of ppl.  Would not recommend for a larger group."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go Bar Isabel since I lived in Toronto, it did not disappoint.  We made a reservation 5 days in advance for a Thursday night. The food was amazing from the start to finish.  Service: The staff there is amazing and one of them is hilarious and made our meal delightful. You will be very well hydrated and they are very knowledgable about the menu.   We start the meal with Oysters Escabeche. It was a great start, it was refreshing and delicious.  Cheese and Meat Plate with Sourdough Bread: the Bread was so good, I'm not a fan of sourdough, but I enjoyed it. The cheese and meat selection was great as well! Their olives were delicious and warm!  Patatas Bravas with Boquerones and Morcilla: I feel like this is their version of a poutine. It was fried cubes of potatoes with sauce on it and green onions along with anchovies. and blood sausage. I was craving for more!  Ceviche: It was Creamy with the avocados and there were so many chucks of fish. Probably one of the better ceviche I have had in a while. This is a must!  Octopus: You cannot go wrong with the octopus. It was cooked to perfection. It was not rubbery at all.   Basque Cake and Sherry Cream: This was recommended by the server and boy did it not disappoint. It was a warm cake with cream on top but it was amazing from start to finish. I sometimes dream about it! This is a must!  Overall, I would come back! The food and service were great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. But I wish I would have started with dessert first because I would've loved to while the thing.   After reading Yelp reviews, I knew we needed to order the grilled octopus. But other than that, we let our server tell us what to get. The only thing I couldn't bring myself to try was the marrow.  So the octopus - fantastic. We ordered a quarter and it was plenty. It also came with chorizo which was a little too spicy for my wimpy self.  The other things we had:  mussels - they had this amazing smoky flavor and were fantastic. I'm glad there were only 6 because I could have eaten these all night.   Shrimp/watercress salad - this was so light and refreshing - a little citrus mixed in and the dressing was refreshing.   The foie gras - this was my favorite of the night. The mix of flavored was incredible. It was bread with some honey, some type of meat and then the foie gras. Heaven in your mouth right here.   Halibut ceviche - what a treat. Another awesome mix of flavors - the apparently the deliciousness on top was crispy fried pig ears. Not something I would have tried if I knew what it was, but I loved it.   And then basque cake. Amazing. Light and flavorful - and the hot sherry cream on top couldn't have been better.   Lastly, but not least, the service was awesome. Everyone was so attentive."}
{"text":"This place is great!   We ordered the bread (came with authentic Spanish olive oil which has a taste I've never had before) delicious! The ceviche crispy pig ears were tasty but a bit overpriced for what you got! The stand out dish was the bone marrow! Take the grilled bread.... spread the delicious green sauce... spread the bone marrow and pinch the salt on top of that and you have an incredible unforgettable taste in your mouth Next time we'll try the black sausage filled potatoes and the octopus!"}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!!   We did the tasting menu which was a very reasonable price for what we got. We told our server to have fun with it and bring us whatever he liked and he did not disappoint. He also brought us a sample of a beer he thought we would enjoy based on our original selection. He hadn't tried it before either so he had a small sample with us which was amazing.   We'll be going back for sure"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in the city for sure. The atmosphere is dark with bright colourful lights that has this old feel to it. Service is amazing they do team service and someone is always around if you need help with anything or have questions or want to order more.  It's toppers and I highly suggest ordering a bunch of different things. The sebrasoda is the best thing in the world. I always order an order just for myself. You'll understand once you bite into it. It's the perfect mix of a tender but crisp piece of bread, spicy meat, sweet honey and creamy/buttery foie on top.  The peppers, octopus, cheeses and cocktails are great also. You MUST get the bask cake too. It's a dream!"}
{"text":"Best food experience . Full stop! The Service..the space .. The food Wow!! Amazing attention to detail and staff that seems authentically engaged."}
{"text":"Made last minute reservations and was surprised to actually get a table.  The lighting and whole environment of the restaurant was perfect for the tone of a Spanish bar. The lighting was dim with different colored pendent stain glass light fixtures. The floors were designed  with random colorful tiles. I loved the jazz/blues music playing in the back ground as well.  Our server was helpful in explaining the menu and suggesting drinks. I actually didn't like one of my drinks and she was kind enough to  switch it out for me. She was always there when we needed her and we never felt that she forgot about us in a busy environment.  The food... Was good in terms of quality but I would not say the BEST. The Cecina was sweet and tender, the patatas bravas was crispy and hardy  but nothing unique compared to others i have tried. The bone marrow was my least favorite. It was prepared well, but lacked flavor; although, the coriander chutney was on point! The grilled octopus was done very well. It was nice and tender and grilled perfectly.   It was an enjoyable experience, but I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Great place to go to. Busy atmosphere but lovely and knowledgeable staff. Would definitely go again. Their grilled octopus is the best octopus I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Omg delicious ! Iwas there 3 weeks ago with bf and what a fantastic night; cured meat platter, ham croquettes , 1/2 grilled octopus yummy and should of have the whole thing. Bottle of cava and few cocktails before and were highly recommanded by one of the very friendly server the gâteau basque. Sitting at the bar watching bartender mixing hundreds of cocktails while serving us. Overall great place to be anyday of the week.did i mentioned cheese..."}
{"text":"We really like the ambiance and the staff is always super friendly and on the ball.   Favourite dishes here are, foie gras, the basque cake and octopus.   However this time the grilled octopus was served with chorizo, on a rice and strawberries sauce bed, which I must say was not my favourite. But the octopus itself was delicious.   Ask your server for recommendations but try to be adventurous and you wont be disappointed (e.g blood sausages:-))  Overall the food here is always good and the service is great."}
{"text":"While Bar Isabel had it's moment as a late night spot for industry people serving great food late, it's lost a bit of it's food charm over the years. Don't get me wrong - the place is still as cute and inviting as ever, the staff are consistently excellent, but the food's just been going down over the years and the prices have just kept increasing. It's sad to see a great place loose it's greatness in slow motion. Inconsistency in the cooking is also a growing issue here."}
{"text":"Regretfully removing a star from my rating for this truly visionary restaurant. I will give it back when the chef breaks up with Yoko Ono and puts the whole sea bream ceviche back on the menu."}
{"text":"This was by far my favorite meal & experience in Toronto.  We sat at the bar on a Thursday night and were served by george (bartender) and Ellen (wine steward).  They were both great - friendly, helpful and really knowledgeable.   We had a mixed charcuterie plate and an order of the (warm) olives - their bread is to die for.  Ellen help us pick out a reasonable bottle of Tempranillo from their extensive Spanish wine list.  We then shared the skirt steak and frites - melt in your mouth.   The quality of food here was impeccable; it's a super-cozy place with great service.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"With an expectation of having a feel of spain, bar isabel fell short on it. But no fret i throughly enjoyed the food.  Started of with the pickled vegtables, fresh and great flavor. Did 24 oysters they were amazing!! The hot sauce they have is great! Next we had the patatas bravas, they were ok , unfortunately it fell short on the ones i have had in Spain. Octopus was alright, potatoes were kinda burnt. Great with the puree...   Also had the mussel escabeche which was great flavor profiling !  The fish n chips, was odd i prefer eating my anchovies as is the bbq chips over powers the subtle sweet fish flavor.  Tartar special of the day was cool it was served with chicharon unfortunately the cream was strong that it over powered the beef.   All in all bar isabel is a great place for hang out and food trips!  Worth the visit."}
{"text":"I started the meal off with a conversation about how lately I've been finding it difficult to be impressed with restaurants in the city. Talk about irony. Bar Isabel really left an impression on us. Everything was perfectly executed, delicious, and showed some originality. We started with some oysters, adobo pork pinxtos, croquetas, smoked sweetbreads on raw tuna, and roasted bone marrow. The croquetas were remarkably cheesy, the sweetbread dish had incredible balance of flavor, the pinxtos were fresh and crunchy, and the bone marrow was decadent. We opted for a 1/4 octopus and the morcilla with foie as our mains. The octopus was tender, flavorful and nicely charred, and the foie was unlike any other I've had in Toronto. Home-run, not to mention the incredible basque cake and 1946 PX we had for dessert."}
{"text":"I've heard many great things about Bar Isabel. Took my best friend here for her birthday dinner. I'm a fan of dim lighting, but not so dim that the menu becomes impossible to read. It was also too loud to have a proper conversation. I did enjoy the food, especially the grilled octopus. Menu was large and confusing, so bring a Spanish friend or ask your waiter for recommendations."}
{"text":"A little pricey but the food is very good. Especially their bone marrow!"}
{"text":"Best food, best service, best cocktails I've had so far in Toronto. Highly recommend! But it's super busy so get there early for seats."}
{"text":"One of the best places in Toronto for tasty seafood. The octopus is delicious and I really enjoyed the mussels. The cocktails sound great and I tried one of their creations which was excellent. Service was friendly and everything arrived at a good pace. It's very busy so I recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Met some friends here on a Friday after work, cool place to unwind and enjoy passing around plates and stories.  Quite enough to talk, lively enough to keep interested.  We ordered the Grilled Octopus for the table and it was incredible!  I ordered several Gin Propers just for me...reserve a table and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Boom...listen I can talk about the food all night long but I'm here to give a shout out to Ellen, Nate and Alessandro.   Listen the food alone is a 5/5 but the service, the service is amazing these people are simply awesome, knowledgeable, friendly and just over all amazing human beings KUDOS.   Enjoy yourselves"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited Bar Isabel on a Wednesday night and it was packed. We were able to get a seat within 20 minutes, though the tables are quite small for what we had planned; planned to get several dishes to share. Please note that for some reason I can't access their menu online, so I have no idea if the names of the dishes are correct.   1st item: blood sausage. The plate came with 3 small pieces of sausage with slices of foie gras on top and smoked apple chutney served with 2 mini brioches. First we thought that the foie gras was a flavored butter. I loved the warm sweet brioche on its own. The sausage itself my friend and I thought was \"safe.\" Safe meaning that the flavors were pleasant, but there was no punch of any distinctive flavor.   2nd item: bone marrow. I have been dying to try bone marrow for ages. I had read reviews that noted that the portion was not very big, but I did not find the portion to be an issue. It was enough for my friend and I to share. When we received the bone marrow, we were told that chef recommends that we sprinkle sea salt on the marrow. So this is what we did. My friend and I thought that not for the salt and chimichurri sauce, the bone marrow would have been bland. Maybe that's the point. Bone marrow is naturally bland?   3rd item: Fried chicken. What can I say? It was fried chicken. Personally I thought that it needed to be crispier with more batter, and less fatty. I had to put aside a lot of fat but it likely would not have been the cases it the chicken had been crispier, since it is more pleasant to eat crispy skin than pieces of soft fat. But in it's defense, it was very moist.   4th item: tongue sandwich. My friend and I like tongue and have eaten it whole in the past, but when we received the order, the tongue was disguised. It was shredded so thinly that I don't know how anyone could tell that it was tongue that you were eating. It looked like it could have been any number of cold cuts.   Ultimately we had no big issues with Bar Isabel. The food was tasty and the environment cozy."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here Sunday night for a birthday celebration and we were not disappointed!   They had a lot of really great items on the menu and we were having a hard time deciding so the very friendly server suggested the first-timers option, which would be about 12 different dishes including a dessert for $50 a head, so we went for that. The meal was nice, but not beyond expectations.  It started off with the typical pickled veg, olives, bread, cured meat, and cheese plus a couple of fun extras like smoked mussels and sardines. Yum! Next we had some type of croquettes and a crostini type of thing with a meat and shaved foie gras on top. Amazing! The final few dishes were a quarter serving of octopus (which is what they're famous for and which is surprisingly large), steak with chimichurri, and some sautéed greens. Dessert was a simple Basque cake with a sherry cream.   The meal was delicious, but it was very... Unexciting. I feel like the hype about this place really raised my expectations and while I was not disappointed, I was not wowed by any one thing. I highly recommend this place for a wonderful dinner, just don't expect anything \"out of the box\" in terms of creativity or originality."}
{"text":"Our server/bartender Melanie was great!  She made great cocktail recommendations and then crafted them in front of our eyes. She gave great info to make decisions on food, all spot on. The best dining/drinking experience I can remember. ORDER THE FOIE GRAS TOAST dish. We had one...then another! Dessert was incredible too, even gluten free!"}
{"text":"Despite the street facing front window being open and having all of the ceiling fans on full blast, it was almost unbearably warm inside of Bar Isabel on a recent jam packed weekday night. The music was on high and made casual conversation difficult, but the dim lighting and intimate tables gave the place a romantic vibe.   The cocktails are playfully named and described and pretty good, although I do find $15 to be a bit more than I would like to pay for a casual drink (especially when I'm prone to multiples). My friends both opted for draft beers, which there were a number of to choose from.  It was really busy, but the service was decent. Water service was sparse since the glasses are tiny. It would be nice if they could just leave carafes at each table in consideration of the hot weather.  The fried chicken is fantastic and reminiscent of the Emmet Ray version, which is cooked sous vide. Bar Isabel's healthy portion comes is somehow as moist and tender as can be and is served with a buttermilk sauce that has a tantalizing hint of a kick at the finish.  The rest of the menu looks great. I can't wait to try everything else."}
{"text":"With all the hype from friends and online reviews, I had high expectations for this place. Unfortunately, I have to admit that I was quite disappointed. This place is good but nothing special.   FOOD:  Roast Bone Marrow (3/5) - Very disappointed in this dish. Tasted extremely plain and lacked seasoning. Their sister restaurant, Black Hoof, is the place you want to go  Grilled Cuttlefish & Sea Spinach (5/5) - I absolutely adored this dish. The cuttlefish was cooked to perfection and very well garnished.. The sauce was so flavourful that I was tempted to lick the plate clean. Highly recommended!  Sweetbreads & Raw Tuna (3.75/5) - I felt this dish was pretty basic. It was nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  Octopus (4/5) - In terms of taste, I would rate this dish a 3.5. It lacks seasoning and flavour. We did not bother finishing it. I ended up rating this dish a 4 due to the respect for how Bar Isabel is able to cook the octopus. It is chewy and not dry with no rubbery taste to it, which is a very difficult task to accomplish  Mussels Escabeche, Pork Belly, Broccoli (3.5/5) - When this dish came, I was very surprised. The pork belly was in strips like bacon. Nevertheless, the overall taste of mussels, pork belly and broccoli complimented each other in terms of texture. Once again, it was nice but nothing amazing  DRINKS:  The Smoking Jacket (3/5) - As a huge scotch fan, I was recommended this drink but I have to say that I was really disappointed. I have to admit that this is partly my fault for ordering a scotch cocktail since I like my scotch clean  A Doctor's Orders (3.5/5) - It was good but nothing great. Pretty average  My Favourite Ex-Girlfriend (5/5) - I loved this drink and the name suits it perfectly. It is very sweet and just plain delicious  Overall, for the price, I would probably not return to this restaurant. If I do, it would definitely be for the cuttlefish!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here last night and so glad I did! Cocktails were amazing! My friend and I didn't know exactly what we wanted so after a little chat with our server and mentioning the word \"gin\".. he ended up bringing us two delicious ones.  We weren't exactly sure what we were in the mood for so our server gave us a few great suggestions. We ordered a few small plates and loved everything! The server was personable, knowledgable and attentive. The entire experience was lovely and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is fun, lively and tasty.  I can't say I had anything bad here but I will say the food is heavy.  There isn't a lot of balance or produce to lighten their dishes, so my only complaint is that you leave here feeling full, maybe even a little too uncomfortably full."}
{"text":"Great food! Nice ambiance! Loved the octopus and the chips! Should book to save your spot! The kitchen is open till 2am!"}
{"text":"Hard not to give this place 5 stars. Aside from the ridiculous reservation wait times, this place is the real-life heaven for tapas style dining. Reservations are an absolute must, but you can generally snag a seat at their bar after 10pm. Been here a handful of times and I still drool just thinking about it!  I always have the \"go-to\" items, and will meander off to try a few new items as well. Follow these steps and you'll be in heaven in no time!   \"Hi, what would you like to order?\"  1. Full Grilled Octopus ( they change up the style every so often) 2. Foie Gras and Morcilla(blood Sausage)  3. A plate of Jamon Iberico de Bellota 4. Basque Cake with Sherry Cream    Other notables:   1. Goose neck barnacles - fun to eat if you've never had. 2. Anchovy and cream fraiche 3. Sweetbreads and raw tuna   Their cocktail program is also amazing. Have an old fashioned and you'll know what I mean. They also carry some rare items like Dillon's absinthe, and a number of bourbons which are hard to find in Toronto.   The check can be a bit shocking for big groups, especially with the portion sizes so it's best to keep it to groups of 2-4."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 3.5/5 small but cozy. Friendly Spanish bar like atmosphere.   Service: 4/5 friendly and helpful  Drinks: 3/5 not too impressed by one of the cocktails.. it sounded and looked very fancy, but tasted like medicine.. (i guess it's a personal preference) They were good to change it though if it wasn't your liking..I am so sorry I had to send one back..   Food: 3.5/5 Seafood soup was a great portion, delicious and very unique.   The other items we ordered came in really small portions..   The foie gras with chorizo and brioche was Delicious- not heavy on the foie gras at all, but only 2 pieces, red chorizo was really good.   Croquettes were flavourful, but nothing out of the ordinary.   I can't remember the other items we tried, but didn't seem like we could go wrong with anything we ordered here.   Prices are on the high end, but they don't skimp on quality- just taste their olive oil when you order bread and you'll know what I mean.   I would return, because I had a great experience, but would like to try other Tapas places first."}
{"text":"When you walk in, look down! The tiled floor was really unique and sets the tone for a fun night. We got the pan con tomato, patatas, and beet salad. Food was good. I recommend you get a \"Lil aperitif\" cocktail to start. I got the \"Manhattan\" which was good. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and recommended a nice bottle. A fun spot for an evening out."}
{"text":"Best Late Night Eats in Toronto! I go here at least three times a month with my husband! We are not big drinkers but love everything about the food. We always order: 1 dozen oysters, the charcuterie board, octopus or scallop ceviche, deep fried chicken is a must and depending on our appetite, the Ribeye with foie gras. The food always come out perfect. Delicious, well seasoned and the right temperature. Our water glasses are always full and refilled within the minute. My husband loves the Golden Boy Virgin cocktail and I always order the Albarino or Sparkling by the glass.   I gave you four stars because the last time we were in, you had no deep fried chicken and that was the main reason why we came. If you put deep fried chicken back on the everyday menu I will give you six stars."}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... some good dishes but service was slipping very fast throughout the night & flavours weren't as great as other 4 star places.  Maybe I came with too high of an expectation, maybe I ordered wrong (but I would have hoped the server steered us right), or maybe it's one of their off nights.  Maybe Bar Isabel isn't my place.  I came here incredibly hopeful of a mind blowing meal that rivalled my Buca or Grey Gardens experience as it's rated in the top 15 in Canada 100 best restaurant.  That's some serious cred right there but for the price, it was just ok for us.  They do have online reservations but this small, dimly lit, and super loud bar books up super fast.  I made weekend reservations a month in advance.  That was easy and simple to do.  Our arrival was quickly greeted and shown to our table.  We were seated in the back along the wall.  It was comfortable and tables were well spaced.  Unfortunately it was so soooo loud.  You cannot have a conversation even when yelling.  We noticed most tables were either getting louder and louder with the more glasses poured or they're quickly leaving with little conversation.    Service here is quite varied ... looking at other tables, there were 2 very good staff who helped craft the dinners and mentioned the specials.  Ours just nodded their head and he never mentioned once the specials or what was good to order when asked.  This is where I feel we probably ordered wrong.  We had the garden pickles, ensalada de la casa, scallops, bone marrow, chorizo rojo, and quarter octopus along side some ciders.  We didn't order the famed Basque cake because we waited and waited for someone to come by but we were mostly left ignored for nearly 15 minutes with menus on our tables.   Garden Pickles - decent with fair variety of different vegetables but nothing unusual or special about it.  Comparing to maple leaf tavern, theirs had an unique spice kick that made it pop.  This was just simple.  3.5/5  Ensalada de la casa - one of the better dishes of the night.  Several variety of different shaved vegetables lightly and nicely dressed.  It had Sprouts, fennel, carrots, Brussels sprouts, and pomegranate.  Light and refreshing.  Solid choice 4/5  Bone Marrow - I've had bone marrow at a few other places and it's usually a rich wonderful bite with the accompaniments.  This was mostly a miss ... this is definitely one of the smaller marrows at a higher price point.  It came with 4 pieces of large toasted bread that were possibly cut too big as each bite consisted mostly of dried bread, a smear of lightly flavoured chimichurri, and a few tiny spoonful of marrow.  There wasn't enough marrow to even make it to 3 pieces of bread and the chimichurri was very light in flavour compared to the Argentinian ones I've had which help make the meat pop and cut through the juicy fatty flavour.  3/5  Scallops - maybe Toronto has a hard time doing scallops.  Thinly sliced scallops are lightly grilled and then placed on an asparagus and leek sauce.  The scallops were cooked fairly good.  The sear marks were a faded beige and because of how it was thinly sliced, once of the pieces were already crumbling before even attempting to eat it.  The leek and asparagus sauce was mild and didn't really add much flavour to the already mild scallops.  It reminds me of my Good Son scallops order ... I wish I got something else 3/5  Chorizo rojo - most flavourful dish of the night.  Bold and smokey, this is a great chorizo.  Loved the spicy heat that it brings.  It is a small portion but because of the flavour, it is satisfying.  If all dishes were this good, I would have left quite happy. 4/5  Grilled quarter octopus - this is supposedly be one of the best octopus in Toronto if you read Yelp reviews.  A quarter octopus is a decent size to share for a smaller group or twosome.  It is nicely tender with a softer chew and some good grilled edges.  Cooking wise... awesome.  Flavour ... it was missing compared to other places I've had.  The sauce had some spice (paprika?) but it wasn't enough to give the octopus anything to be memorable.  3.5/5  I was hoping for an amazing dinner but left quite disappointed.  Service ended up being forgetful and we left without dessert because it just took too long to be acknowledged.  Bar isabel clearly is loved but just didn't provide the flavour or service for me to recommend."}
{"text":"Wow! The tastes and textures of all the dishes were so balanced and flavourful. I went with a group of 5 ppl and we shared many dishes including: bone marrow, potatoes drizzled with aioli(don't know the name in Spanish), octopus, smoked sweetbread with raw tuna and persimmon(my favourite), ceviche, and fried milk drizzled with dulce de leche. Definitely go here.   The atmosphere was very nice. It was a small area where you could share food with a small group of friends and/or family.   I went on a Friday night at 6pm with no reservation. If you arrive right at the opening time then you will get a seat. Around 6:30, the place was filled with ppl already. I recommend going to the place right when it opens or book a time."}
{"text":"3 years since my last visit, Bar Isabel continues to deliver with quality food and service! Reservations highly recommended as this place gets busy - we made one at 6pm for four and scored a bright, lovely spot by the window. Interiors are eclectic, well-crafted, and cozy. We shared and enjoyed the following - it's enough to be stuffed: - Cheese Plate ($18) with Bread ($4) - Leek Montaditos 4pc ($18): vegan friendly FYI - Bone Marrow ($16) - Quarter Octopus ($22): the star! Cool that they offer a smaller size now. - Patatas Bravas ($9): Not special but ok if more carbs are needed  Standout is the service here, which excels at being warm, attentive and inconspicuous. Our server grouped our order into courses and introduced each dish thoroughly. Plates would be changed and water refilled like clockwork without prompt. They even folded my friend's napkin when she went to the washroom! Overall, a great place on special occasions for a quality dining experience with a few close friends."}
{"text":"You'll never want to go to another Tapas place ever again. Bar Isabel knows how to do food. The highlights were the anchovies, foie gras and grilled octopus. We also got pan con tomate, oysters, olives, cheese, papatas bravas, chorizo Verde and grilled vegetables. If we could've kept eating we would've gotten the whole menu. Next time we are in town we are making it to dessert!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! What a great way to experience all that Toronto has to offer. We had a group of 5 ppl with no allergies ready to take on whatever the chef recommended. So many amazing dishes well prepared. I am still dreaming of the foe gras. Some other delicious options: ceviche, beef tongue, octopus, anchovies. Honesty so many show stoppers!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was a pro, she gave the best suggestions based on what we like to eat and drink. The only thing I would complain about is the cocktail prices are little steep. Other than that, this meal was perfection. This place is the holy grail, Grant and his staff are incredibly good at what they do. Easily in my \"top 5, top 5, top 5\" places to eat in the city....  Haida Gwaii Sidestripe Shrimp - their homemade cocktail sauce was on point, shrimp was perfect.  Sobrasada & Foie Gras - I had no idea foie gras could be shaved. It was the best thing I've had in a long time. Definitely a must when you go.  Roast Bone Marrow - This comes with bread thats been grilled and a green sauce (forgot what its called) with a thick shaved salt of some kind to put on the bone marrow. Buttery and delectable. Also a must when you go.  Mahón (Cheese)- I love cheese and buy different kinds on the regular...Had this there and fell in love...  Scallop Ceviche - This dish was perfect, a mix of sweet, spicy and sour...the scallops were perfect. Thoroughly enjoyed this dish!  Swollen Knees!- This cocktail was insanely good, little small but so good. A great balance of everything thats listed in this drink."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got reservations for 10:30 pm on Saturday night. It was so late but well worth it! Our waiter was funny and played along with our jokes. For drinks I had the barragana cocktail which consists of tequila, cointreau, lime, sage and  charred pineapple and jalapeno. Mine was refreshing and the jalapeno was spicy. My boyfriend had the Copacabeza cocktail which was stronger than mine and  had a weird aftertaste of Chinese medicine lol It consisted of tequila, amontillado and Spanish vermouth, fernet branca. We ordered more drinks but they forgot to bring them and we were OK wit that because by the time we were done our first drink we were almost done eating the food and decided to get drinks elsewhere. We shared the olives, the serrano ham and the tomato bread. All very good. The olives had garlic and paprika on it. The bread had a crunchy crust and soft inside with a nice even layer of tomato. It was so tasty that I didn't mind eating the carbs. Lol The ham was also very good. Next we shared the sobrasada (chorizo paste) and foie gras on two pieces of bread. Also very good. Then came the bone marrow which was big and came with a chimichurri sauce. I never had it with chimichurri before and it was surprisingly good. I tried it with and without and I actually  preferred with. The waiter recommended the sweetbread and white tuna which I was not excited for but got anyway because I trusted the waiter and boy was I glad I did!! That was one of the best things we ate that night! The sweetbread was deep fried and the fish was fresh. I'm not really a big fan of tuna but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and highly recommend it. I was most excited for the grilled octopus because I heard it was good but I preferred the other dishes. The ends were a bit too charred for my liking. The sauce was very good though. Overall I would definitely recommend this place and would want to  come back."}
{"text":"The food was great as always. Must try the octopus, best in town! Tender and juicy. We also tried pork jowl secreto, surprisingly good,very tender and had smokey flavour, and one of the server kindly stopped by and explained how the dish was made. Great place great food."}
{"text":"After hearing so much hype about Bar Isabel, we visited with a friend on a Friday evening with high expectations. We made a reservation a few weeks out, and could only book a table for 6:30 pm or 9:00 pm. Since my friend had an early morning flight the next day, we went with the 6:30 pm reservation. When we arrived, the restaurant was already quite busy with most of the tables full. It made for a nice bustling ambience. The restaurant has a dark vibe, with some red/orange lights and small tables (but with plenty of room between the tables).   We started with cocktails. My friend and husband tried the improved amaretto sour ($17), which was definitely quite strong and not my taste. However, they both enjoyed it. I had a gin cocktail, but I can't remember what it was called... it was sour and delicious, and perfect for my tastes. The flavours were very balanced. To start, we ordered bread ($5) and a mixed charcuterie plate ($22). The bread is made fresh in house, and was served with a really nice olive oil. The bread was fluffy and fresh, but crispy on the outside. The mixed plate had Manchego, another sharp and dry cheese and two types of meat (looked like salami, could not understand what they are called). It was solid, but quite a small portion.   We then ordered the jamon croquetas ($9 for 2) and the sobrasada + foie gras ($13 for 2). These two dishes were the highlight of the meal for me. The croquetas are made with cheese, ham and a béchamel inside, resulting in a creamy, rich and delicious bundle of heaven. The foie gras was served on small, toasted pieces of baguette and was finely grated on top of the sobrasada. The foie gras was rich, but I actually loved how it was served shaved. It broke up the flavour a little bit. For our final course we shared a quarter octopus ($25), the cod, clam, mussel and tomato dish ($28) and the cabbage with anchovy ($12). The octopus was very good and lived up to the hype, but I'm just not a huge fan of octopus. I didn't like the other two dishes. The cabbage was essentially a quarter of a cabbage that was extremely difficult to cut and bland. The clams in the other dish were grainy and this turned me off. Even without this, the dish was bland.      Our server was pretty unfriendly. Although he did inform us about the specials and did his job, he came across as very abrupt. We asked for a wine recommendation with our price point and he just left the table, came back with a bottle and started opening it. It was just a bit of an odd exchange, without any explanation of the wine.   At the end, our bill was $300 without tip for three people. Some parts of the meal were quite good - the foie gras/croquetas and the octopus. I was pretty underwhelmed by the other dishes, and just wasn't blown away. $300 seems quite steep as well, when we walked away without feeling very full. I'm not sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"Ok for all the hardcore foodies with sophisticated pallets - get on over and order up some bone marrow and octopus already.  Solid service to boot."}
{"text":"What the fuck! Seriously!! When I came to Spain and I saw people partying...  I cannot produce the words to adequately describe my late night dining experience  but I will provide hearsay: our server told us that some really special food thing I've never heard of was just in and the guy who is responsible for the Noma (the danish michelin starred place with all the local stuff from the nextflix docs) bread had their bread and had the most intense positive reaction of the entire food crew TO THEIR BREAD. I strongly echo the bread guy's feelings with respect to the bread, which STRONGLY reverberate to the rest of their delicious offerings and entire dining experience.  College west west is college west as fuck. I'm really into it. 6 stars.  I also really appreciate Isabel's attitude towards late night dining. If you show up late, they are quick to make you feel as though you ought order food and are not keeping the kitchen open or staff at work. They're proud of their food and their restaurant and they ought be."}
{"text":"When one visits a faraway place, they should make it a point to have at least one fine dining experience. This place was \"it\" for me and my traveling companion. First, I love tapas because you get to try so many dishes and share the experience with others. Secondly, I love the ambiance of dining out experiences and this place delivered. Dimly lit with a feel of San Francisco-meets-Spain fine dining establishment, we enjoyed many food items but especially memorable was the Shishito Peppers and the Grilled Octopus (OMG). The staff was friendly, the vibe was relaxed and the overall experience is one that my tastebuds will always remember!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Bone marrow dish was my favourite. Good wine list. Very charming atmosphere. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"My first tapas bar experience and I'm so glad it was at this place! Every bite was well crafted and so good. I tried the sweet bread (reluctantly lol), the bone marrow and some other plate with a sweet and savory spread on top of bread (excuse me for not being able to remember the name) and loved every bit of it all. I topped my experience off with a sweet cake with cream desert! Will definitely make my way back."}
{"text":"Excellent , the food was delicious musts are everything ! Service was amazing .. The wine is overpriced so we brought our own bottle. I don't usually bring my own wine but found the wine selection so so and as I said prices are 3 times what they should be ... See my pics for more details"}
{"text":"If not for the high price tag it will get my solid 5 stars. Everything I ordered was so good. Love bar isabel!"}
{"text":"Ughh...this review was hard... it really is a 4.5 but its not worthy of a 4....so i have to round up to a 5.  We came here last night for my birthday dinner. Just me and the hubby. Service was very good...super helpful, friendly and attentive. Water was always topped up. Dishes were cleared promply but not in a rushed manner. The food came out quickly and in a great seqence. Each dish just got better and better.  I ordered A woman scorned for my first drink. It was described as a bit christmasy and i could totally see why...the cinnamon/cloved/nutmeg flavour with the bourben went sooo well on a cold december night. Hubby got a beer which he seemed to enjoy. They also had a cider which i ordered which was very good.  Okay onto the food...  We initially were goign to order alot more than we did...but the server recomended that we eliminate a few items as we would be too full to truly enjoy the meal. Im so glad she guided us this way because we WERE STUFFED by the end of it. And dessert was really pushing it.   first meal: the jalapeno with the chips... had heard alot of good stuff about this dish... essentially red peppers, jalapeno, zuchinni in oil... served with home made warm chips. It was good..... and a great wya to nibble with a drink but it wasnt my favorite. I enjoyed it though. Its worth trying if youre a arge group and have room to try different stuff....   second: potatas bravas supreme. SOOO damn good. Somethign about the blood sausage with the crispy potatoes (fluffy inside)a nd the heal of jalapenos and the delicious citrusy sauce. SOO GOOD. really really loved this.  third: octopus and chorizo verde skewers. Okay... im going to need to come back to bar isabel JUST tot ry the octopus. We have never had grileld octopus that tasted SOO good. and not chewy and just awesomeness in your mouth.   fourth: Ceviche. Holaaaaaaaaaaay molay. Can i say this is the BEST cevhiche rendition i have ever had. AND I KNOW CEVICHE. im Peruvian! this was awesome. the take on it was amazing... the avocado sauce with the fresh fish meat... it wasnt overpowering it was just bliss. it was so delicate and melted in your mouth. The crunchyf ried seaweed was an unexpected but welcome accompanment. i devoured it all. the ceviche is served on a fried fish corpse essentiall but i proceeded to then rip apart and eat entirely.. i barely left anything ont hat plate. I dotn think theyve ever seen it like that before. lol . I will come back and eat this thing over and over again. Bravo!!!  fifth: fried chicken and a buttermilk sauce. Fail on every end. The chicken was nothign special... soryr but ive had way better fried chicken...and the buttermilk sauce was kinda gross..it was like mayo.... i pictured (based on reviews) a glorious buttemrilk gravy - now that would be amazing. but this mayo,....no. just no. and way too much food. we had to push through it. my husband felt the chicken was a bit undercooked...i personally am not so picky so iw as okay with it... but to some...they may feel it was a bit pink...or mayeb it was th elight. who knows. either way i didnt like this and was sad to have ordered it. wish i had another ceviche instead.   sixth: desert was the basque cake .... this was like a corn cake... crispy and flufyf on the inside. they poured the sauce over it at the table whcih was nice... at this point we were stuffed and it was just too much for us. we pushed through tht ecake btu ultimately... we couldnt nejoy it as much as if we had actually had room for it. so my advise...dont over do it.  Overall, i really enjoyed my experience here and there is a reaosn why its no.1 for enroute....the minds int he kitchen are creative and inventive. the cocktails are fantastic. the ambiance is amazing. the service impeccible. over all a big win. Will definately come back to eat throguh more of their menu. :)"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!  My friend and I ended up ordering four - FOUR! - orders of the croquettas.  The octopus and basque cake were also standouts.  Late one Saturday night, we called and asked, if they could seat us, at the last minute.  They said they could offer the bar, which was fine.  The bartender was friendly, service was good, and the drinks were great as well.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is easily among the best food I've had in Toronto. I may be slightly biased because I've yet to try many tapas bars, but I can assure that you will not leave disappointed on the basis of food alone. My favourite dishes include the sweet breads and raw tuna, sea bream ceviche (which I believe is now made with B.C. halibut, perhaps due to seasonality), and the basque cake & sherry cream. Surprisingly, the octopus, which is considered to be their most popular dish, was more of a novelty item IMO. It seemed to lack seasoning, and the sautéed greens underneath were a bit too bitter for my liking. The shishito peppers are a fun item to order if you're dining with a group of friends since ~1/7 are super spicy!  Expect to pay around $40 - $50 per person not including drinks, and reservations are highly recommended no matter what time of the evening based on my experience."}
{"text":"Look, I hate tapas.  I hate it so much.  \"It's a series of small plates, so you can try lots of different things!\"  Awesome!  \"Since the meal isn't served in one big push, it's easier to chat!\"  Sounds great!  \"Everything's meant for sharing!\"  Wait... But you said...  \"...Except the portions are tiny, so the moment you find something you like, you can't have any more of it!\"  Err...  \"And all the dishes are EXPENSIVE!  Often as expensive as a regular entree!\"  Tha' f*** you just say to me?!?  \"And frequently, half the dishes suck!\"  LET ME THE HELL OUT OF HEEERE! ;_;  So yeah, that's why I hate tapas.  It's also why I love, love Bar Isabel; none of those problems exist here. Devastating food in a great atmosphere, with incredible service, in portions that are fit for sharing at a great value.  ...Did I mention the food was devastating?    I walked in with the intent of getting 1 cocktail and 4 dishes.  Instead I had 3 cocktails and 9 dishes.  At one point they took my menu away, but the joke was on them because I'd been ordering off a copy on my phone all night anyways.  Suckers.  Arbol Chili Chickpeas & Snow Pea Leaves - I could write 5000 characters on this dish alone. The thing about Bar Isabel is that whatever's written on the menu only partly describe the dish.  Here, there was no mention of the tart lemony notes that flitter about the snow pea leaves, surprising the tongue in perfect contrast to the heat of the chilis.  This was one of the best things I ate all night, and it was 6 bucks.  Ridiculous.    Devilled Duck Egg, Salt Cod, Morcilla, Hollandaise - Like a mini eggs benedict, but deeper in flavor without being overly rich.  The creamy blood sausage mixes with the hollandaise and the yolk of the duck egg, creating a silken amalgamation.  Tasty.  Mussel Escabeche & Pan Con Tomate - This was delicious, albeit you'll definitely want to share it; my little pot of escabeche deliciousness was packed with 10 or more mussels, and while mussels 1-3 were delicious, mussels 8-to-however-many-damn-mussels-were-in-this-thing had me wondering just how many mussels these people thought I wanted.  I was wishing there was a half-portion by the time I was finished.  How often does that happen at a tapas place?  Roast Bone Marrow - Served with toasted sourdough, the bone marrow takes on different dynamics when you avail yourself of the accompanying sea salt and/or chimichurri sauce.    I'm trying not to use the word \"silken\" again.  Chorizo Verde & Octopus Skewers - I came here wanting the Grilled Octopus, but as I was dining solo I decided to just stick to the smaller-and-on-a-stick version.    Good decision.  The chorizo verde is beautiful, without a hint of grease, rich in meaty and herbal flavors.  It imparts those green notes to the perfectly-cooked bits of octopus, the two difficult to separate when eaten together.  Micro greens adorning the top of each brochette play with texture.  Incredible, especially with the Arbol Chickpeas.  Subtle and brilliant.  Original Tongue on Brioche - This is one of the most lauded items on the menu, and yes, the rumors that it can be a meal in and of itself are true.  Melt-in-your-mouth tongue on soft and crispy brioche tastes of deep brining, drizzled in a creamy sauce with herbal notes.  The accompanying purple mustard adds a delicate tang; I can't understand why such a decadent dish doesn't feel heavy at all.  Worth going back for.  Patatas Bravas - Wow, this is one of the saltiest things I've ever eaten: a mountain of perfectly fried pieces of golden potato, dressed in a bunch of stuff I honestly can't remember, the mission is clear - this is drinking food, and enough of it for several people.  I got to this when I was three drinks deep into the evening and it was right on the mark.  This isn't subtle, but it'll keep you from waking up with a hangover the next day.  Basque Cake & Sherry Cream - Another big-hype dish that delivers, it's rich without being heavy or overly sweet.  The crust is crisp, the center gooey and delicious. The generous portion of sherry cream seems imposing, but imparts no weight to the dish, only serving to dress all sides of each piece in further depths of heavenly sweetness.  And the drinks were pretty great, too!  A Woman Scorned - I'm a huge boulevardier fan, and this is a bourbon cocktail in very much the same vein, but with light fiery notes of heat and romance.  My favorite drink of the evening.  Last Word - The best Last Word I've ever had.  Sorry, Harbor Room.  Isabel Fashioned - The lone disappointment of the evening, this was indisinguishable from an Old Fashioned anywhere else.  Sidecar's version has this beat.  Reputable people have been saying some ridiculous things about Bar Isabel: phrases like \"they're killin' the game\" have been used un-ironically, which would normally be inexcusable.  But believe the hype: Bar Isabel is the tapas restaurant you've always imagined.  Just incredible."}
{"text":"There has been much press about this place, so I went in with mixed feelings: 1) This place should be pretty good and 2) But can it really be THAT good after so much publicity?  The verdict, it really is that good.  Also, one thing is for sure, you definitely need reservations - I went on a Monday evening and heard people being told that it would be over an hour wait just to be seated at the bar.   They have a very nice cocktail menu, with lots of interesting concoctions.  I tried the Older Flame which is a mix of gin, with lots of citrus notes, and egg white.  The drink was very good and quite refreshing.  The food here is served tapas style, here is what our table tried:  1) Oysters: Extremely fresh served with a vinaigrette sauce and what I assume is their take on cocktail sauce... whatever it was, it was delicious.  2) Charcuterie board: We had 4 selections of meats, but my favourite was the chorizo. It had a nice kick to it, but was very flavourful.  The other meats were all thinly sliced and melt in your mouth.  3) Roasted Bone Marrow: You can't really go too wrong with this.  Served with bread, it's like eating the offspring if cream and butter had a baby...again you cannot go wrong here.  4) Whole Fish Ceviche:  I'm not sure what I was expecting but I thought the fish would be bigger.  Nonetheless, the ceviche was fresh, had lots of avocado chunks and very well seasoned.  5) Grilled 1/2 octopus: This was my favourite dish of the night.  Served with greens and potatoes, the octopus is so soft and tender and you could really taste the nice char they have on it.    6) Chickpeas and snow pea leaves:  I must say that I am not a fan of chickpeas in general.  However, this dish was really really good.  The chilis on top were not overly spicy and the flavouring was excellent.  For a non-chickpea fan, this dish was surprisingly good.  7) Basque Cake & Sherry Cream: The cake was nice and moist and the cream wasn't overly sweet.  I'm not really a sweets person, but my friends swear by this cake...so I'm going to forward along their recommendations on this one.  As an overall experience, the food was consistently good and service was excellent.  I would definitely recommend a visit to this place, assuming you make a reservation."}
{"text":"3.5 Star  I don't usually hang out that late downtown but since our guest from Brooklyn was in town, we decided to take her to Bar Isabel for some small sharing plates.  Late Night Menu:  Árbol Chili Chickpeas & Snow Pea Leaves ($6) Morcilla & Salt Cured Foie Gras ($13) WHOLE Sea Bream Ceviche ($26) Original Tongue on Brioche ($14) Roast Alaskan King Crab 1/2 LB ($20) Basque Cake & Sherry Cream ($8.50)  Most of the item we tried were A-OK. I really enjoyed the King crab. I might just skip the fish ceviche.  Hopfenstark, Ostalgia Blonde (750ml) 5.5% ($22)  Seasonal Draft from local breweries including GLB and Bellwoods and Seasonal Bottle Menu with great selection from Le Trou Du Diable and Dieu du ciel.  My Yelp friend ended up picking Hopfenstark, Ostalgia Blonde (750ml) 5.5% ($22), maybe of the low ABV%, maybe of the word \"Blonde\" or maybe it was the cheapest large format bottles on the menu. But I love how the bar attendant came over and served that to us with and explanation of the profile... (he is cute too, but it was kind of dark...)  Bar Isabel has an impressive cocktail list too. I would just hang out at the bar and have a drink or 2... $15 a pop, I have to take it easy.  Bar Isabel is a good place to have a night cap with friends and have a snack or 2. They do take reservations!"}
{"text":"100% lives up to the hype. This is some of the best food in the city.  A few years after this place first opened and after trying in vain more than a couple of times to make reservations, I finally managed to stumble in for a 9:30 p.m. drink and snack at the bar with the fiance. The ambiance is the first thing that will impress; dimly lit, floored with vintage pattern tile, decorated with bookcases, mirrors and other accouterments to affording Bar Isabel a singularly European canvas on which to serve delicious treats.  The servers are clearly very well trained, know the menu intimately and are very focused on providing attentive, polished service. We were seated at the bar and our server and the bartender were both helpful in their suggestions and were overall just very good at their jobs.  Since we had already had dinner, we decided to order a few small plates. We got beef tartare and smoked fish. Can't talk about it. Just super delicious. We were already stuffed, but the food was so impressive we decided to go for yet another course. . .  I'm not much for dessert, but Bar Isabel shocked my face off when I learned they have a gluten-free cake option. I pounced on this rare occasion and once again my face fell off when I had a bite of their corn-based cake, drowning in a sweet cream. We also had a portion of chocolate and fennel gelato, which had an unbelievable flavor and texture (it seemed somewhere between ice cream and a thick pudding). I can't recall a more memorable dessert!   Bar Isabel is a true gem in Toronto and could hold its own in any city. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I saw in BlogTO that this restaurant became #1 in Toronto in 2013 and decided to check it out. Food was exceptionally good. Even the simplest thing like calamari taste different than any other restaurants. They have some very exciting cocktails. Also the waiters are all very professional. It's a must go!"}
{"text":"This has been on my list for a long time... After trying to walk in on a Friday night and getting turned away, we booked online in advance. Tonight was the night. Service was exceptional and our water glasses were never empty. The food wasnt over salted, thankfully.   We had the peppers, anchovy mustard cabbage, sausage fois gras crostini, and part of an octopus. Octopus smelt amazing. Peppers were great accompanyment to snack on with drink while the rest of everything showed up in a very timely manner (probably because it was a winter Wednesday).   Their beer list and cocktail list was splendid, though they were out of the draft that caught my beerofile eye.   The washrooms were larger than their other restaurants which was lovely because I am a giant.  Atmosphere was wonderful and the lighting was kind, as it hid the lipstick that accidentally found its way to my nose. The floor was nice."}
{"text":"Bar Isabel is a popular restaurant known for their Spanish-influenced tapas dishes. Its location on College and Ossington is easily accessible, and there's a paid parking lot nearby (where Metro and Shoppers are located). I called about 2.5 weeks earlier to secure a reservation for three people for a Saturday. The hostess informed me that their small table might not be comfortable for three, and that they'll need the table back by 8:15 pm. I ended up accepting the 6:30 pm reservation slot as I wanted to try out the restaurant.   The decor is supposed to resemble a Spanish tavern with its wood panels and decorative yet mismatched floor tiles. The atmosphere itself is very lively around 7:30 pm and onwards. I am not too fond of the red lighting that emits throughout the establishment but it's not overly distracting.   Bread ($4) -Sharable  - Came with olive oil and butter - I believe that it was sourdough bread and sadly it was not warm.   Oysters ($32) - Ordered 12 oysters - $2.67 each - Exceptionally tasty and fresh - Each batch arrived on a bed of ice with two condiments and lemon slices.   The 1/2 grilled octopus ($34)  - Enjoyable dish - Wasn't chewy but rather tender, and had a nice charred taste to it - There's a whole octopus for $59   Spicy fried squid, crispy tongue & kale ($8)  - The outside texture of the fried squid was flavorful and slightly crispy.   The roast bone marrow ($11)  - Rich tasting but rather small (only two pieces of bone marrow) - Try not to overload on the chimicurri sauce as it has a strong flavor to it.   Albacore tuna tiradito ($14) - Was an okay dish - The tuna was sliced fairly thin and quickly fell apart when I attempted to divide and scoop everything onto my plate  Bar Isabel doesn't assign one server per table; I believe that they do work as a team. Our table of three was served by about 2-3 different servers throughout the entire dinner. They were knowledgeable of the menu, and our initial server provided some recommendations. Although the service was not exceptional; it was still rather good as our servers were polite, and quick to take away our finished dishes."}
{"text":"This place can't be beat! Fun atmosphere and amazing food / service. We will be back soon :) that octopus is unreal"}
{"text":"This place was a perfect dinner. Our waiter, Matthew, suggested the kitchen choosing a variety of small plates for us to try. Every single plate was perfect and the flow of food and tastes was great. Service was so kind and attentive, the restaurant itself was wonderfully intimate, and the food was amazing. Order the sobrasada and foie gras. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We visited Bar Isabel this past weekend. It was my boyfriend's bday so we had to reserve weeks in advance, which is the one downside of this venue.  We got the early 6 pm sitting, got seated right away and attended to by a friendly waitress. Customer Service is excellent  Ambiance is very old school, Spanish influenced. Hipster and fashionable wait staff. We started off with their signature Rum Punch cocktail. It was great! In typical Spanish style, the menu features a host of tapas ideal for sharing. We had decided to try the Patatas Bravas w/ Boquerones & Morcilla, Chips & Boquerones and Pan Con Tomate. For dinner we proceeded to have the 8 oz Bevette - amazing! and Grilled Cuttlefish - delicious but minimalistic. The cuttlefish is rather on a light side, almost so that I would suggest it as a shareable or a salad starter. Overall food was great, but not mindblowing.  Overall experience was great when you account for the atomosphere and their top notch customer service."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite restaurants in town.   The service is great, not too pushy but also very attentive and friendly.   The food is amazing, the chef's selection is a great choice if it's your first time eating there and you don't know what to pick. Just ask the waiter about it, since I don't think there's anything written about that on the menu. Of course, the octopus is a must try! My favourite dish is their simple dessert, the Basque Cake.   NB: I know that myself and my dining companions usually appear much younger than we really are. At most nicer restaurants I've noticed a big difference in the service we receive compared to when we dine with people who look older, or when parents come along. Totally not the case here and I've been here multiple times now!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is dope ... As is the lighting even when you're three drinks in and you know you're eyeliner has smudged.   Staff I super friendly and knowledgable about cocktails wine list and ingredients.   Foie gras. Get it. Maybe order two.   Octopus is ok. It's impressive in its presentation and the fregola is yummy though the octopus could be more tender and salted ... And perhaps exhibit some of that chargrilled taste so evident in the awesome steak! Get it rare and enjoy those hen mushrooms.   Salted cod was nice.   Beef carpaccio is a good starter, especially when gingerly folded on top of the tomato bread.   Shishito peppers should be ordered even before you sit down to help you gather yourself and order the appropriate run of cocktails. It may take you a while. There are a plethora of solid options.   Scallops. Nice and spicy.   Net net. Head here and have a good time. Enter after 9:30 for the best setting.   Wait ... And that basque cake. Shit ... Don't share it. It's like eating a thick, very soft (but with the perfect ratio of buttery, crisp edges) homemade sugar cookie with warm, melted vanilla frosting that is hand poured table side by your lovely waiter. Hey guys, can you pack this up and deliver to nyc for me? Geesh...  Date worthy. Music is like stepping into a euro dubstep meets nyc carbone guys.   Group up to 6 worthy.  Loud enough that you won't have much awkward silence. Quiet enough to hear each other speak.   Enjoy.   //foodpaparazzi"}
{"text":"Food and drink: As a vegetarian, the options are simple and somewhat limited but very well executed. I loved the olives, manchego cheese, and patatas bravas. The preparation highlights the ingredients themselves and doesn't leave you feeling heavy after the meal. They can also adjust the dish to half-portions so you can try more items. I loved my cocktail (one of the best I've had) - mezcal with lemon/lime, etc.  Service and atmosphere: Absolutely love the atmosphere - dimly lit, cozy and bustling, great for a Saturday night. Be sure to make a reso well in advance though as it books up quick! The waiters are great at providing suggestions - trust them, they won't guide you astray. We also had a mix-up with what we thought we ordered and what we got, but the staff was quick to adjust our bill - kudos!"}
{"text":"Adventurous tasting menu - not for the faint of heart, but totally worth it for the experience.  For example, I would never normally order something like sweetbreads served on albacore sashimi, but it was probably the best part of the entire meal. The charcuterie was also good, oysters were fine but not great (probably b/c they're from the east coast and I'm a west coast oyster snob).  The other great item was the ceviche served on the whole fish - very impressed by the flavors. I can't say I loved the whole grilled octopus, but at that point I was already stuffed - others really enjoyed it.  The desserts were excellent - there was a warm basque cake drizzled with this honey creme that I could have inhaled on my own and a mousse-like ice cream. For tasting menus dessert is usually an afterthought but not here.   We got a reservation for the 6 of us, which I highly recommend. Place isn't huge so I can't imagine being a walk-in (esp. in winter) would be a good idea.   Just be prepared to spend a lot - mixed drinks start around $15 and the tasting menu ain't cheap either."}
{"text":"I already gave Bar Isabel 5 stars but I feel the need to update this review to really show my appreciation.   I wish I had the chance to catch the server and the bartenders name, but I have never felt so taken care of before! Our server was extremely attentive and I felt I did not need to wait for anything. Very knowledgeable and just a great guy. The bartender who made my drink was fantastic. Not only was my beverage exactly what I was looking for but she event took time to write down the measurements and ingredients so I could make it at home.   Bar Isabel, your food is amazing, and your staff are unbelievable. Just keep doing what you're doing!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to head over to Bar Isabel (@BarIsabel797) right at their opening time this past Sunday without a reservation after so many failed attempt at making one. There was already people waiting and within minutes of opening, the place start filling up. No surprise since it's been voted by so many as the Best new restaurant.  I hate waiting and we actually got a back-up reservation just in case, but we were seated as soon as we walk in. My guess is, they leave a lot of their tables open for walk in, hence the difficulty in getting a reservation.  Bought to you by Grant Van Gameren, the person behind The Black Hoof together with another former Hoofer Brandon Olsen as Chef de Cuisine and Guy Rawlings as General Manager; it can't help but be a recipe for success.  The 75-seats interior feels like a Spanish tavern to me with the Cherry wood panels, hand-made Mexican tiles, arched crevices framing the dinning room. chairs & lights that doesn't match together with the red glow ambient lighting.... all that together gave the space an European charm.  Trou du Diable, Belgian Table Beer $9  Isabel Fashioned $15 ~ Buffalo trace bourbon, bacon sugar, xocolatl mole / angostura bitters, orange zest   Baraganna $15 ~ Charred Pineapple infused 1800 tequila, Cointreau, pardon peppers & sage simple syrup, lime juice ~ While the Fashioned was really nice, I find it really difficult to enjoy it while eating.  ~ The Baraganna was a lot better, love the sweet fresh pineapple taste and balance perfectly with just the right amount of lime plus the pop of the heat.  Smoked Sweetbread, Raw Tuna, Persimmon & Brown Butter $18 ~ This was one of our fave dish of the night, we love the contrast of the hot vs cold, crispy vs soft and springy vs creamy. ~ All the ingredients didn't seem to fit together at first but they were all in perfect harmony here.  Whole Fish Ceviche w/ avocado & frizzzled leeks $26 ~ The fish was expertly took apart, ceviched and put back on top of the deep fried bones and head.  ~ Not only an amazing presentation but perfectly seasoned big chucks of fish with  the creamy avocado mixed in plus the crispy leek on top.  ~! Perfect combination of flavors and texture, definitely one of the best ceviche I have ever had.   Roast Bone Marrow w/ Toasted Bread & Chimichurri Sauce $9 ~ We got ours raw, it was still red when we dig into it and told our server about it which is quickly replace with a new doubled portioned.  ~ But unfortunately it was still slightly red but better than the first one.  ~ On the other hand, I love it with the chimichurri sauce instead of the usual parsley.   Stewed Gizzards & Pork, Poached Egg, Smoked Cheese $14 ~ We has some bread left from the bone marrow and it was perfect for dipping into this.  ~ The gizzards was cooked so melt-in-your-mouth soft which fit perfectly together with the tart tomato sauce which was balanced with the creamy egg and salty cheese.  1/2 Grilled Octopus $34 ($59 got a whole one) ~ This was gorgeous looking but also perfectly cook and I guess it have to do with the size for it to be the perfect texture.  ~ Love how there wasn't any sauce/dressing which allow the octopus sweetness and charred/grill taste shine, paired with the simplest lemony veggies at the bottom.   Basque Cake & Sherry Cream |$8.5 ~ Never had Basque cake before so I had no idea what to expect but it was so good. Moist creamy center with a crispy shell goodness, served warm it was my kind of dessert. ~  I find the Sherry cream bit too sweet and prefer the cake on it's own, so I really appreciate it being served so you can control how much to put on it.   Verdict : ~ Love it here, totally understand the buzz ~ Perfect drinks, perfect food and perfect service ~ Will definitely come back and definitely want to try their infamous late night platter"}
{"text":"Two words. Basque. Cake. Your life is not complete without it. Stop in for cocktails and cake, sit on the rail, and eat your life-changing cake smothered in hot sherry cream. You're welcome."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong if you end the night with the corn ice cream with spicy caramel and walnut crumble... And the basque cake... No, really."}
{"text":"Been twice, first time was a miss but second time was a huge win.  I think you have to be selective with what you order, some things were very underwhelming - such as the peppers and green onions (not on the menu when I went back for round two).  However the cured meat platter is incredible and the 18oz ribeye with foie gras is possibly the best cut of meat I've had in my life. If I was only basing this on my second time it would be for sure 5 stars.  You can't go wrong with the desserts. Definitely worth a visit and worthy of the hype.  Great atmosphere, great service, mostly great food"}
{"text":"A Spanish food gem in Toronto. Bar Isabel is elegant, charming and contemporary. A small, cozy space perfect for a quick drink  or a hearty meal.  The menu looks a little intimidating with lots of hard to pronounce names, but the waitstaff is really good at translating.  Highlights include the cheesy foie gras on baguette croutons, the ceviche served on a fried fish skeleton, the lightly salted self-proclaimed \"best ham in the world\" and the rich soft cheese sourced from the island of Menorca. The pan con tomate i.e. tomato paste on large sourdough slices is also high on the flavour spectrum with a nice tangy kick.  Everything is tapas style and very finger food-y really enhancing the social side of the meal. Really, there's no surprise this place is very full...all the time."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place from friends we (my gf and I) met at Buffalo Proper (Buffalo, NY), let me just say Bar Isabel did not disappoint! The perfect place to go to enjoy late night culinary delights and amazing craft cocktails! Leigh and Greg behind the bar were both engaging and informative. I will not visit Toronto without going back to Bar Isabel! Thank you both for making our vacation that much more exceptional!"}
{"text":"Why?! What?! So confused. What is with the hype and long wait for a weekend table?! Seriously I prefer Mai Bistro and Spice Lounge over Bar Isabel 10x over and for less than half of the price. We ordered 5 dishes for two and a few cocktails. Total came to 170. It was good but it wasn't amazing. For the price, so not worth it. I can't say I would recommend it. Maybe people go here for the cocktails...but definitely can't be about the food. It was just okay. But the service was stellar. Very friendly and prompt service without being overbearing."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food, good atmosphere. Can't go wrong. The octopus is really good and you can always ask for half portions if you want to try more things!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, feels like you are in a family members home, warm with funky decor.  My fav dishes were the grilled octopus and bone marrow.  I would definitely come back again, highly recommended for dining with a group or event on a date."}
{"text":"The food and cocktails were good but it was so blatantly obvious they wanted us to leave so they can give our table to other people. It really ruined my experience of feeling welcome. I definitely won't go back because I don't want to be in places I'm not wanted."}
{"text":"I came here a couple months ago,  and I was dieing to write this review for all of you that need to try this place out!!  Yes the food is amazing and full of flavour and service was top notch!!  The atmosphere is truly amazing super cozy try it out guys you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lovely birthday tapas and cocktails and was not disappointed.  We ordered the charcuterie plate, bread, some olives and preserved vegetables to start. The charcuterie was curated very well, and the meats were all distinct from each other and very, very delicious. The bread was everything. A chewy, open crumb and a thick sour crust. Too fucking good.  Preserved veggies were crunchy and sweet, olives were also really nicely seasoned. Then we ordered the sweetbreads, the scallops with honeycrisp apple, the octopus, and the patatas bravas imperial. Patatas bravas was devoured in seconds and we immediately began thinking up ways to recreate it at home. It's the kind of thing you don't want to eat only once. The octopus was also great, an unpretentious plate of dandelion greens cooked in oil and pepper with very gently seasoned octopus legs on top. Insanely tender, just perfect. The sweetbreads ... I don't even know. I'm still not entirely sure what a sweetbread is, but it remains one of the best things I've ever eaten. If you ever go here, you need to order the sweetbreads. Indescribable  The scallops were bitsy and served with little spheres of honeycrisp and melon. This was a refreshing, soft dish with a fabulous play on texture that kind of brings tears to my eyes when I think about it. Cocktail-wise I had the Baraganna which tasted like a sage margarita, tequila tasted expensive. I didn't taste anyone else's drink because I didn't want them tasting mine, so I can't comment on the other cocktails. Mine was fabulous enough to not want to share, and I think that says enough.  We had the leche frita with salted dulce de leche for dessert. I wanted more even after eating a full meal.  I would come here every goddamn day if I could. Good, unpretentious food that doesn't sacrifice flavour or honesty for bizarre presentation and shock factor. Loved it."}
{"text":"Had my second visit to Bar Isabel last night and it was just as good as I remembered. The ambiance is awesome and the wait staff are super knowledgable and friendly, but most importantly the food is amazing. Started with my first ever Bottle of orange wine--super interesting and tasty. For food, sampled the snow crab, scallop ceviche, beef tartar, carrots (sounds boring but was soo good), patatas bravas, and bone marrow. Make sure you check out the owners other restaurant also, Bar Raval!"}
