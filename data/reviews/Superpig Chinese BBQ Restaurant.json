{"text":"Not bad to grab lunch. Very friendly staff and great tasting food. Especially their BBQ pork rice."}
{"text":"Super friendly owners! The roast bbq pig is never dry like most bbq restaurants, super crispy skin and just so moist! Prices are fair compared to other places."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese BBQ restaurant I've ever been to. I ordered the classic roasted pork with rice and wow it's not like any other place. Usually other BBQ restaurants give you a mere 8 thin slices of roasted pork,  however, super pig goes ham and decides to give you 16 THICK slices of HQ pork.   I don't care what anyone says about this restaurant because it's my GO TO.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone craving Chinois BBQ."}
{"text":"Great authentic BBQ foods for a great price! The student specials are conveniently priced and well advertised and I visit this place often to satisfy this craving. The only thing is that sometimes the food isn't consistent and I will get really big portions one time and smaller the next. Also, I would love it if they gave more veggies.   Overall, I think this place is better for takeout as the interior atmosphere is kinda sketchy and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I ordered the pick your own 3 dishes meal for take out. I didn't expect much from this place and didn't even bother to take pictures of the food. Service is on the slow side when buying their BBQ. The lady cutting up your meat is also your hostess, waitress, taking phone orders and trying to manage/train her staff at the same time. Props for her for caring and showing passion about her business. Service on their non-BBQ food is average speed.  On to the review of their food. It's a small menu for create your own meal. I ordered the garlic stir fry A vegetable, grouper with hot and spicy salt and Yu-shiang chicken slices. All of them were delicious. I couldn't stop eating them once I tasted it. The chicken was really tasty and flavourful. The fish batter was a bit thick, but it was crunchy and seasoned well. The veggie was good too. They lined their styrofoam boxes with aluminum foil, which was a nice touch. The meal came with rice, soup or dessert. I didn't know you have a choice on soup or dessert until another customer placed an order.  The owner mentioned some people doesn't eat pork, so they give a dessert option. I was impressed again since most Chinese restaurant will not care about your dietary restrictions. Giving you an option is . I'm glad I've tried this place since I'm not too impressed with similar restaurants in the same plaza. I'll definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place is terrible, the boss took my cash in the middle of cutting bbq duck and gave me the greasy receipt and continued cutting duck without cleaning his hands. No wonder nobody was in the restaurant at dinner time. And the restaurant could not provide a receipt with hst# upon request. I boil the duck in water for five minutes and cleaned a few times before eating it. Do not go if you care about food safety at all."}
{"text":"Great place for bbq pork, crispy roasted pork, free-run chicken and bbq duck. A bit on the expensive side when you purchase the bbq meats, but its definitely worth it once you had had a taste. Authentic and very well marinated.  I have had a few of their dishes that they serve as well and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Totally overrated. Food quality is definitely not up to standard. Service is not good. No clue what the owner(female) is doing. She seem really busy but when you look closely she have no clue what he is doing."}
{"text":"This maybe the only Chinese BBQ Restaurant in the area. Without any competition, they can really priced themselves with a premium price. I personally don't mind paying more if the food is good. But sadly their BBQ Pork and Duck really fall short. Even not up to par to some of the supermarket takeout quality.  BBQ Pork and Duck 2 item take out rice box cost $8.50. Both the pork and duck were on the dry side. Duck though has a better marinated flavour but hardly have any meat. Pork lacked the charred and umami character and ultra lean. The soy milk that came complimentary has this funny taste which I just trashed after the first sip.  Superpig does get quite busy during lunch break since it is right next to a high school and offers student specials."}
{"text":"Awesome place for students to dine. Most meals here are $5 plus tax which comes with a boatload of rice, a heavy load of meat, and a few boiled vegetables. The seasoning on the food is pretty standard - the typical BBQ, soy sauce, lemon, or deep fried marinade accustomed to most Chinese BBQ restaurants. Wouldn't say this place is my go to place for Chinese food, but for the price, I am pretty happy with what I got.   The service is really slow. They refill the tea  every forty minutes, which was kind of underwhelming. They also give you utensils a few minutes after they serve you the dish... Peculiar.   The soup that comes with the student special is bland. Opt for the soy milk instead."}
