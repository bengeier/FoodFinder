{"text":"I have high standards of authentic Mexican food. This place hands down the best in valley.  Burritos well put together, not greasy and great after a long day at Wet n wild. The location is next to freeway but this is definitely the pace to go if you want a giant burrito. There is tequila and imported beer with plenty of seating.  10 of 10"}
{"text":"Came because Yelpers really liked it. It seemed a bit more \"assembly line\" than I have been eating around Phoenix, but was still very good. Just sort of lacked that \"grandma in the kitchen\" feel.
I kept it simple with a couple chicken tacos and a few rolled steak tacos. Added some chips/salsa for good measure. They have a great little self-serve salsa bar with 5 different salsas that were all very good. Mild to Spicy, couple green, few red. 
The Tacos were huge! Piled with Guacamole and Pico, and some pretty good chicken(guessing thigh meat) The rolled steak tacos were pretty much a taquito from what I know. Service was great and friendly, location was nice and clean. There are a lot of options for Mexican food, this one is pretty solid. East to get to right off The 101 on 59th Ave. I'd probably go back if I were in the neighborhood, but wouldn't drive miles out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Good Mexican Food menudo Saturday. Been here several times and the food is good. Hawaiian Burrito the best you need to try it"}
{"text":"I can only tell you about their rolled tacos which are some of the best rolled tacos I have tried. The only thing is that they are small for the price but the quality makes up for that. Also the price for a soda is almost three dollars. I would have given them a higher rating but they only got three stars because of the portion size and  price. I would still recommend this place and I will be back for those rolled tacos but I will be drinking water. Haha!"}
{"text":"This food was just decent. The tacos al pastor we're not traditional al pastor tacos but overall it was decent."}
{"text":"Fish tacos here are great! Decent prices for Mexican food.

Only reason they don't get 5 stars from me is that the salsa isn't great. It has heat but not much for taste.

I would definitely recommend them. The staff seems good and food quality is consistent."}
{"text":"Yum. Had the veggie burrito. The cute cashier also let me know that there is NO LARD in the beans! The restaurant is also very clean. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went in to dine with my family today, and it was beyond amazing! My carne asada burrito was spectacular, and my whole family loved their plates too, will come back again !"}
{"text":"My husband got sick the night after we had lunch here.  My tacos were hard on the ends and top and dripping with grease from the center.  It wasn't especially clean either.  I can't figure out how they got a four star rating."}
{"text":"Love this place. Haven't found better tasting Mexican food at this price point. Myself and my friends frequent this place all the time and it never disappoints. The Diablo Shrimp burrito is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is better than alot of your fast Mexican food joints around town. Not saying it's the best but I think they have decent food at very fair prices and restaurant is always clean unlike alot of others out there."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast burrito that was incredible.
Three other people in my party and they loved what they ordered.
Reasonably priced and excellent food.
My new favorite spot in the neighborhood w/ great customer service."}
{"text":"Very good Carne Asada buritto. Good prices and quick service. Good little joint to go to in the area"}
{"text":"Very poor service and very expensive for what you get. First time I ever went in here and will be the last. Ordered fajitas and when I got home no tortillas in the bag, called and was told I realized when you walked out the door, no attemp to come after me and not apologetic. $24 for 2 meals and no chips and salsa included  unless you pay extra, cheaper in a restaurant and then to get home and not have all your order. Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Good tacos and burritos, Can't beat the 1.99 tacos even if you get \"TNS\" taco neck syndrome.
One day soon I'll try that burrito that is as big as a baby's arm. Then I'll be back to review it."}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos EVER! Honestly if I could afford it I would eat their breakfast burritos every day! My husband has gotten other items off the menu and they have all been delicious. This is my go to Mexican food restaurant! I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"This place was actually pretty good. My husband ordered the carne asada burrito and I ordered the veggie burrito; we both enjoyed them. Out of all the sauce options we thought that the green and the medium sauces were the best choices. The only downfall was the MAJOR grammatical mistake on the salsa bar. It reads \"grilled onion's\", \"hot carrot's'\", and \"season onion's\".... fix that fast!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food with good service. Only set back is the pricing. It's cheaper to buy a fully loaded bagel."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal!  It is my most favorite Mexican food ever!  The have a Chile Rellano burrito that is to die for.   Happy hour Mon thru Friday with all Mexican beers in a bottle just $2 bucks.   Their salsa bar is the best in the business with a variety of salsas that are all fantastic not to mention the spicy carrots and grilled onions.  The staff is friendly and helpful and the owner is there 24/7 and is one of the nicest guys!   Fish tacos are just awesome and Tuesday is taco night with specials galore!
You won't regret your visit to Ricardo's."}
{"text":"I had the Banderita  burrito and it was amazing, a party for my mouth. The best chile roja EVER! I've never been disappointed with Ricardo's. The carnitas torta is scrumptious, too. It gets crowded at lunch but you'll be able to find a seat.
Try it! If you enjoy authentic Mexican food, you'll love this. The salsa bar has some fabby sides, my fave is the onions. They're brown, sautéed a little, very tasty. Remember: you're going for the food, not the ambiance.
It's about the art of food cooked with passion!"}
{"text":"Good food! Nice service! Easy access from the 101 from work. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"I think the quality of food has changed over the time. It was good in the past, apart of that they are not good in serving the proper order. I ordered \"Arizona Chicken Burrito\" and what I got was beef Burrito, other time I ordered same and there were pieces of beef in chicken burrito. I'll avoid to go there."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Good food. Great salsa bar with a range of hotness and escabeche. Delicious big burritos. Staff is friendly. Ricardo's has become one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Don't get the carne asada fries or the tostada + taco combo. Both are HORRIBLE! 

1) Carne Asada Fries:  First, the cheese was not melted at all. Second, the carne asada had no flavor. It just tasted like rubber.  There were also beans in the carne asada fries which was the first.  If you get a chance, try the carne asada fries in San Diego, and you'll realize why this dish at Ricardo's is horrendous.

2) Tostada + Taco: Tostada was not flavorful at all. Tasted like canned beans spread on top of a crispy taco shell with lettuce.  The taco was similar to the tostada, except their was some type of meat which also had no flavor.

I'd recommend going to Del Taco for more authentic flavors."}
{"text":"When there is a hair in your food it kills your appetite. When the workers aren't very apologetic and friendly it makes it even worse. When we came in they weren't very friendly. Getting our food didn't take very long. I asked for sour cream but there was a misunderstanding because I wasn't given any. I went back up and asked for it and was charged $1.08 for a small cup. I started to eat my food and it was very good. I noticed a black hair in mine. I went back up and pointed it out to them. They acted like it wasn't a big deal. They got me another taco. So if you want unfriendly service, good food, and a hair in your food then come here."}
{"text":"Amazing Taco Tuesday Deals!!! The fish taco is $1.49 and hands down the best fish taco I have ever had! And I LOVE tacos. Eat here!!!"}
{"text":"This place was good. Service was fast and friendly. Love the salsa bar. Four of us were happy with our meal."}
{"text":"Here's an honest review: as a New Mexican, this is not the best Mexican food I've had.  Not even close.  In fact, it is perfectly average.  Just like most of the Mexican restaurants in Glendale and Phoenix.

However, I'm giving this place 5 stars because the great service and countless menu options really make it something special.  I have vegetarians in my family and they were astounded by all of the vegetarian options.  They seem to have thought of everything in terms of combinations and substitutions -- it really feels like you have a thousand options.  They have friendly and efficient workers, the food is served quickly, and it is fresh.

Definitely check this place out.  As long as you go in with honest expectations, you'll have an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time. Ordered  the teriyaki chicken burrito. It was huge and the teriyaki made it really savory. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Not a good morning for Ricardo and the cook. As seems to be the case at many Mexican quickie joints they use french fries in the breakfast burrito, but they fail to deep fry them enough. The result was uncooked raw fries and a mess of a morning and the loss of seven bucks.

This place also can't stop raising prices. The last menu I had at my house indicated prices about a buck less than the new menu. So we have higher prices, same quality food, but they do make a decent hot carrot.  Will add hash browns next time as those seem easier to cook for the \"chefs\" at Roberto's."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is inexpensive, well prepared, fresh and the portions are generous.  The location is not great, you wouldn't expect a place this good in a strip mall with a Del Taco.  I have had the fish tacos, carne asada, chorizo breakfast burrito and they are all good.  The salsa bar is loaded.  The staff is friendly and ready to help."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican food next to Home Depot for those double dip days. They actually carry al pastor which is pork marinated in like a pineapple sweet sauce. Large choice of different items to try! Great family style restaurant , owners are always working with a smile."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here it was delicious. Service was fast. The beer was cold & lots of salsa to choose from. The came out & talked with just great place. The price was amazing for the amount of food they give you. I give it Two thumbs up.."}
{"text":"I got the Carne Asada burrito. And a drink total was 9$ not that bad that's a responsible price. I got like 7 chips on the side lol.. They should of just gave me none because the chips aren't good at all and their salsas are okay nothing amazing. The burrito was actually pretty good it was very juicy every bite I had juice like spill out that's what it was making it good the guacamole inside was perfect with the meat. Place is cool like 4 tables were dirty when I walked in I cleaned it myself. Also the girl upfront doesn't have energy and just stands their and waits for you to come up to her to order. Kinda awkward. The place needs a little bit more energy. Also theirs a 25 cent refill box by the coke machine. Hahaha I don't think anyone would ever put 25 cents because one it was dirty and their was nothing in it. They seriously need to take that out just embarrassing. The bathroom was dirty too so I didn't understand how these guys get an A when food inspection comes because the place was dirty everywhere I looked. If you want just a good burrito yeah sure come grab one but it's not a place I'll be coming back to just doesn't have what I like in a place."}
{"text":"Been coming here for awhile now... Their EVERYTHING is good. No really, not going to sit here and say what's good on the menu because every single bit of it is the best whatever of that you've ever had. I will say however, my favorites are the Fish Taco's and the Burrito's and the Enchiladas and the... I said I wasn't going to do that and I did. The fish taco's are the best you'll get north of Cabo, they are way better than Rubio's ever thought about being and are just so tasty. The Arizona burrito is phenomenal, as is the California. The gal who is always working here at night is so incredibly nice and friendly as well, always makes us feel so welcomed and happy to come in. This is one of my favorite little Mexican Restaurants of all time, you cannot go wrong here, give it a shot and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Amazing homestyle and authentic Mexican food.  Reasonably priced, and a great deal of variety.  I loved the Chili verde burritos."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Everything I have ordered has been pretty good. There's places close by though that are just as good or better but give free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Walked in to this spot instead of panda and ordered 2 fish tacos being taco Tuesday I figured I'd eat tacos and to my surprise the tacos were really good only down fall was the tortillas could have been warmed up a bit more but hey this spot was worth would have given it a 5 star if the tortillas were a bit warmer but all in all I'll be coming back soon to have some more fish tacos and maybe just maybe try something else on the menu"}
{"text":"Love this place! We come here often, the food is always great, fresh and fast! Salsa is wonderful! Everything is always good here, it's like an awesome mix of a fast food place and an actual sit down Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a hard to please guy..look at my prior reviews, you'll see, and I love this place.  So much more than the typical Phoenix Mexican fare of everything bland, slathered in refried beans and cheap greasy cheese...the food here has flavor and reasonable prices.  The salsas are typical cheap bottled, mass produced tasting, and sadly no pico available at the salsa bar, but I rarely find myself wishing for it here anyways.  I keep coming back for more though :)"}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito, tasty and filling, served with side of chips, under $6 for most burritos. Salsa bar with various salsas and marinated carrots, onion, jalapeno, garlic. Hidden in a strip mall, near the Del Taco in the Home Depot area. Pick up your day workers and lunch too."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, addictive, what more could you want? It also has a nice family owned feel to it. I love their veggie burrito!"}
{"text":"So I just got done eating this food. We got the carnitas burrito wet and a shredded beef chimichanga and all I can say is this food lacks in flavor. The red sauce taste like it comes straight from a can at least add more spices the carnitas meet isn't too bad. The shredded beef chimichanga was a little better then the wet burrito but not by much the shredded beef was okay it lacked spice. This food is not worth the price. The burritos were so bad that my husband and I didn't even finish the burritos we threw them out. Mixteca is a whole lot better then this place.  

On another note we got the kids crunchy tacos and they said they were good. Still not enough to get us to go again."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop for breakfast burritos on the way to work.  Lots of choices for your add-ins, and the salsas are tasty. 

Great friendly service is a bonus."}
{"text":"It's decent, but not great.  Both the food and salsa are a little bit on the light side, so I suppose they are perfect for those who like Mexican-like food but not the full flavors of real Mexican food.  Prices are reasonable and the portions are quite large.

They have a salsa bar with four salsas available.  All were good, but again, all were a little bit too light and none had any heat to them.

I went here when my car was being serviced nearby, and I'd do it again if I found myself here again.  I wouldn't choose it on purpose."}
{"text":"Amazing food! By far my favorite salsa and you get a good amount for the price you pay."}
{"text":"First time here today, and wow do they have phenomenal food!! I got a country style breakfast burrito with pico and sour cream added. Wow. The eggs and potatoes are so fresh, I am so glad I just found this place so randomly! Definitely will make this a necessary stop weekly."}
{"text":"Delicious shrimp tacos!! Their burritos are huge and inexpensive and most importantly delicious. Blanca helped me with my order and gave me recommendations of what to try. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"The correct address is 20020 N. 59TH AVE .

I note this place is very new and still working things out and has potential so it's worth a try.

We tried several things here and I think some things are better than others.

From what I tried on my visit I think the Beef Asada and the Chile Verde are much better than the fish here. The meats were flavorful but terribly dry when we were here.  The fish from the fish tacos might have been a frozen product that had little flavor and it was kind of dry for fish.

They have a selection of house made sauces and a few condiments to add to your dish.

Customer service is not the best.

I ordered a side of Hot Carrots (.99 cents) before I noticed they are a free condiment. They should have told me it was on the sauce bar. But it made me a little more mad when the woman working there runs me an empty cup and tells me to fill it up myself from the freebie bar. If they are on freebie bar why charge me???? 


Like I already said they are new and still working things out hope your visit is better."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try while spouse was next door picking up panda express. And OMG delicious! Best fish tacos I've had since moving to AZ.  It's right down the St from our new home and we will be repete customers  :)"}
{"text":"This place was clean, had a good range of food and fast service. I ordered the carne asada fries today and there was refried beans served in there... I've been to enough places and I've never had it with it. It was kinda weird but for me I was not a big fan. The meat was dry and chewy. Not the best but it's alright"}
{"text":"A tasty reasonably priced lunch.

Today was my first visit to Ricardo's Mexican Food Restaurant.  As you enter Ricardo's your greeted by friendly staff who advise you of all the specials.

The dining area was clearly clean, maintained, and well-staffed. My lunch companion and I ordered the Thuraday lunch special, a shredded beef taco, three shredded beef rolled tacos, and a cheese enchilada . 

I didn't care for the enchilada, it was somewhat soggy and lacked taste. However, the tacos and rolled tacos were quite good. The shells were crispy on the outside but soft enough to not fall apart.  The shredded beef was moist, tender, and seasoned as to not overpower the toppings of lettuce, cheddar cheese,  and tomato. 

If your looking for inexpensive Mexican food and great service give  Ricardo's a try."}
{"text":"Quick, easy, no hassle, delicious! Menu has large variety, however my favorite go to is the chimichanga platter. Great weekly specials as well. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican & the best chimichanga in the West Valley!  Always fresh, and everything we've ever tried has been GREAT and very well priced. Dining area is reminiscent of Subway-style with some Mexican artwork flair, but if you're into great food with a casual atmosphere (or call ahead/take out), definitely a hidden gem worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and cleanlyness of this spot is great. I had the machaca breakfast burrito and the ingredients were top notch. I wish this was closer to my home."}
{"text":"I stopped here because of all the excellent Yelp reviews and people raving about the food.  My experience was quite the opposite.  Absolutely the worst attempt at \"Mexican\" I've experienced. The chips smell of rancid grease the beef? was cold full of gristle and the guacamole was a Christmas green.  Salsas were bland at best. Do yourself a favor an move on to a more appealing restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the guy who took my order was friendly.  

I really liked the salsa bar.  They had a decent selection of salsas that were very different from the typical \"Bertos\" restaurant salsas.  I mixed the hot and the medium which was really good.  The salsa were definately made fresh.  

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and shredded beef taco.  The burrito was a good size and hot.   The beans were okay, if I didn't use the salsa with every bite I would say they would have been a little bland.  The taco was great!  Their taco shells are exactly the way I like them, crispy but thin.  

This place reminded me a lot of Senor Taco.  The salsa was similar and they also used the white Monterey jack cheese.   

My only complaint is the prices are slightly high if you order a la carte but I would eat here again and recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"I love mexican food and this is one the most authentic and best priced. The Surf burrito is killer!!!"}
{"text":"10 thumbs up from our crew!  I had the machaca plate and it was the perfect mixture of egg, beef and veggies. Thankfully no tomatoes!

My sons quesadilla was cheesy without being greasy.

My other son had rolled tacos.  With the exception of the poisonous guacamole ;) he ate all three.

I sacrificed and scraped guac off and ate it with my plate.

The Mrs. had the carne asada salad and liked it.

Well done, Ricardo's!

We liked the hot and mild salsa.  Not a fan of the medium.  I just like a sweeter salsa."}
{"text":"I still love this place, however I just got a chimichanga and it didn't have any sour cream or guacamole which just makes this a deep fried burrito."}
{"text":"This place is the Bee's knees. Some of the best burritos I've ever had.  Usually get a bean and cheese and rice but their carne asada is also delicious.  Extremely consistent and always friendly.  Reasonable prices and their salsa bar is great. They are my favorite Mexican food."}
{"text":"We popped in for breakfast burritos while running errands. Delicious chorizo & egg burrito; hubs liked his \"hash\" burrito (egg, cheese, sour cream, hash browns, bacon & sausage). The gentleman was so nice he made fresh coffee for me too. Clean, delicious little restaurant. Great find."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for fast/take-out Mexican, this is my new go-to place.  Sorry Federico's!  Although you have an ever-so-convenient drive-thru and later hours, I've decided that Ricardo's food just tastes better!  I just wish that Ricardo's offered the same hot sauce that Federico's uses - those ever-present little plastic cups filled with red saucy goodness.  Ricardo's does have a salsa bar, but it's definitely not a highlight, IMO.  Pretty much everything I've tried here is tasty, especially their beans (I love refried beans).  Prices are decent.  The staff is always pleasant, and the place is pretty clean.  I'm sold--a happy repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's the simple things that you remember. I've been here many times and never been disappointed but somehow this little place was forgotten in my mind. I guess it's because I don't make it around here much. Today, I was STARVING! I just happen to be in the area and remembered them. I ordered something off of their menu. A simple bean tostada but asked for shredded beef. I had just worked out and needed the extra protein. This tostada was delivered to my table and the angels where singing. Ahhhhh! It was just what I needed! You know, it wasn't JUST a tostada. He decorated it with a special cheese. It was pretty too, go figure. Well, as famished as I was, I tried not to gobble and managed to slow down to enjoy the flavors. I had a party in my mouth. Who knew... A tostada could be so yummmmy? I totally recommend this little place. Not only are they accommodating, yummy but I enjoyed a clean yet tasteful dinning experience."}
{"text":"I moved to Phoenix from Southern California and am used to delicious Mexican food. Since living here, there are only two authentic Mexican food spots that taste delicious and this is one of them. Carne Assad burrito and the shrimp plate ( I think it's called diablo shrimp) are the best."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food with authentic taste and \"man size\" portions.  Been going here for a couple of years and had many things on the menu and never disappointed.  Great customer service and a family atmosphere and can always watch sports on TV."}
{"text":"The food is great! The prices are good and you get your food really fast one weird thing is that you don't get your napkins until they bring your food to you which is odd but this is a cool little spot that is good for breakfast lunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Food was ok but pretty bland. I was told the Taquitos we're homemade but sadly they were skinny and seemed to be premade. Now my biggest gripe was the cheap dime store plates and cuttlery, the knife and fork we're so flimsy it was a chore to cut and eat the cheese enchiladas. I can think of better places to go."}
{"text":"First time....tried chorizo breakfast burrito.  One of the hrs that I have ever had!  Salsa bar.....the bomb! Thanks Ricardo! Alan from Huntington Beach California"}
{"text":"I've tried almost everything on the Ricardo's menu, and rarely am I disappointed. We love their breakfast burritos, Carne Asada fries, and the fish tacos. The daily specials are reasonably priced. This place is a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"I dont understand why this place has high ratings. It's possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I got a wet shredded chicken burrito and it's terrible. The sauce is really gross. The chicken was cooked in tomato sauce, and the tortilla is way greasy. The rice that comes on the side is dry and has too much paprika, and the beans are... Whatever. They're canned beans. It's cheap ingredients with a terrible outcome. I didn't go inside so I can't talk about the customer service or location, but based on food alone, I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Cashiers are always kind & friendly. Food is consistently tasty. Menu is pretty large. They serve breakfast, lunch, & dinner. Prices won't hit you over the head"}
{"text":"Got the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice, and a side of chips with salsa. Everything was incredibly bland. The chips were thick like the kind you get from the grocery store, and lacked salt. The medium salsa tasted like carrots. The beans tasted straight out of a can with no spice or flavor. The enchilada sauce had a hint of cinnamon in it."}
{"text":"Ricardo's has some good food. I work from home and this is right around the corner from my house so I eat here about once a week. The enchilada sauce is not your typical enchilada sauce from the can. I don't know what it is but Ricardo's keeps me coming back! The staff is shy which doesn't bother me, and this place gets packed during lunchtime so beware!"}
{"text":"This place is good for takeout ! I eat here once in a while ... Not my decor but its really pretty good food. Its near the Salon & if i have to wait its this or Rubios !! This is more Mexi ... & quiet, but the game is always on!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short. Ricardos is probably the best place to go to for fish tacos. You will not find better ingredients or portion sizes for the price that you pay. Taco tuesdays are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Good service. I had the two beef tacos. The taco shells are really good. Taste like they deep fry the shells. My girls had the kids bean and cheese burritos. I like the tortillas too. The beans are a bit think but not bad. I will come back."}
{"text":"Bomb burritos, definitely will be going back the next time I want Mexican food. Being new to Arizona it's hard finding restaurants that the whole family can enjoy.  They're friendly and helpful. They have business and I will be referring my friends too"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Ricardo's Mexican food for years just got on Yelp and had to share how amazing this place is every time I come dine or take out! Consistent and amazing food, also theirs sauce is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Go somewhere else ...Jr burrito with cheese and beans had no cheese, burrito that I paid for extra beans to be added was missing the beans, súper nachos had no cheese and some sort of wanna be guacamole .. oh and their \"carne asada\" should be called bistec a la plancha. For my friends looking for a good burrito or taco place like my self, that know true Mexican food this is a NO GO! Stay away and save your money."}
{"text":"First time and my goodness all the up charges! 2 burritos  $21!!! Up charge to make chimi style and up chrge to make \"wet\" with a little sauce on top. I didn't even dare ask for sour cream, I hope I have at home :( Better Mexi places in area at half the cost."}
{"text":"Worst place ever the only good thing was the cold corona. Rude service had to open my own beer. No meat in our beef taco, cheese in the enchilada was not even melted! Chorizo burrito bland and tasteless! My advice never go there."}
{"text":"Thank you for moving into my neighborhood! Delicious Mexican food, nicely priced & run by super sweet people. Have had the carne Asada burrito and the \"banderita\" burrito and plan on trying every single item in the menu! Lol :-O 
I recommend!"}
{"text":"I still love this place-great customer service and the large menu-way too many options and the prices are affordable. We come here on a regular basis. They also serve beer if you want to catch a game on tv."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review ever, and this place is deserving of it. I work and live right down the road, so this place has become a staple.  They have this huge 16 inch burrito  (no joke) super reasonably priced and to mirror the review before me, the food is outstandingly fresh.  Recommend for good authentic burritos!"}
{"text":"First time I have ever been hungry after eating five rolled tacos.  Their rolled tacos are half the size of what are normally served everywhere else but they still charge the same amount.  The lettuce was welted and the amount of guacamole they give you is a joke. The only redeeming part of this place is the hot sauce. The hot verde sauce was very good but it's not worth going back for."}
