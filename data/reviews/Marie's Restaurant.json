{"text":"My wife and I like new and unique places to eat so while leaving downtown, we Yelped and found Marie's which looked interesting for a Saturday lunch.
We were very pleased with the choice.
Even at 2:00 we were able to order lunch size meals and glad we did.  My wife had the special, stuffed cabbage with mashed potatoes and really liked it.  I went with the Croatian sausages with dumplings.  Great tastes and filling.  They also have good coffee which is a big plus for me.
We will be back."}
{"text":"I was curious about this place for a long time before making an excuse to try it out.

It might be that it does exactly what it does very well and I'm just not a fan of the style, but I found the food a bit bland and overcooked. The basket of bread before me is probably out of an Orlando bag, the salad was almost all iceberg, the schnitzel not exciting, vegetables mushy. The fried cabbage was similar in texture but more interesting. 

Inside it's very old school,  wood paneling, tin ceiling and crown molding,  and old white guys talking business were the only other customers. Very nice waitress. 

Interesting place. If you like old school Croatian it's probably great."}
{"text":"A nice, simple, family owned local restaurant with very tasty food and good portion sizes.

Had the cabbage roll, which was very tasty.

Friendly and welcoming. I will return..."}
{"text":"If you want authentic, homemade Croatian food this is THE place.  Owned by a family from Hercegovina, the food is made by mom and the daughters and simply can not be beat!  Tonight I had their homemade meatloaf, made with the same mix of meats they use in their Sarma (aka cabbage rolls), served with tasty Croatian home fries and fresh bread.  You can wash it down with a Croatian beer, Karovacko Pivo.  Their Sarma is genuine made with soured cabbage leaves, plenty of flavor from the paprika.... and NO tomatoes.  The best you will find."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something that tastes like it came out of someone's grandmother's kitchen then this is the place for you. I cannot more highly recommend this little slice of heaven Tucktaway in downtown Cleveland."}
