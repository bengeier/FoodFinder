{"text":"1st time dining here on Friday. With friends. Nice cozy place. Ordered many appetizers and  entrees and tried them all. Fish was fresh and appts were unique and tasty. Fish stew was excellent dish. Bartender Brandi was a delight and Server Dottie made for  a perfect evening with friends. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First yelp. Deserves to be said. New in town. Neighbor recommended A few dining possibilities and Fork was one of them. So far he's batting a thousand!  Farm to \"Fork\" concept will always get my attention. Albeit trendy, It shows that the Chef purveys with quality and care, not just convenience in mind. Chef Goody could sit down with a rep for 10 mins, Have a truck drop off provisions needed for two weeks and be done with it. Not the case.    Like the fact that the starters are served \"Tapas\" style, Clearly stated to us by our server, It encourages sampling and sharing. We had the Eggplant Hummus with house made pita chips. Which if you're unaware is quite a laborious undertaking unto itself! Creamy and delicious. Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho with shrimp and calamari.  The seafood was perfectly cooked. Very clean and flavorful. I could have drunk a bucket of the soup. Spicy chicken spring rolls with wasabi and a  classic plum dipping sauce was also a 10.     My wife had the arugula salad and I chose the Lamb Shank as our entree. When the Shank arrived it was very tough not to yell \"Willllmaaaaa!\" Gonna guess a minimum 5 hour, low temp braise, yielding FOTB tender meat in a pool of  Demi that many a Chef aspire to produce. Sides of Roasted Cauliflower, delicately charred Asparagus and Spaghetti Squash/Carrot Risotto, all on point.    Nice spectrum of wine by the glass or bottle spanning the globe. Cote du rhone blanc with apps. Rioja with the Shank. Perfect pairing. Big boys are there to play also, if you have the means.    Service was professional,friendly, engaging, attentive, and my personal bugaboo, informed. Hmm, think I'll be back....? Btw, I'm sure the salad was good. forgot to ask!"}
{"text":"The ambience at Fork is nice however, when I asked what the vegetarian options are, I was told by the server my only option is to order ala carte sides. I ordered a salad, portobellos and risotto. The salad (beets and arugula) was delivered first. It was good. The portobellos and risotto were my main. The portobellos were served on a little 2x2\" square plate, which made it fairly difficult to eat, and the risotto in a separate side bowl. The risotto was very good but it was a pieced together, incomplete meal and I felt like the restaurant did nothing to accommodate to my fairly mainstreamed diet.  I was very excited to dine at Fork but left incredibly annoyed.  Most restaurants offer at least 1 vegetarian entree and I would have expected that at Fork, or simply a more accommodating approach, especially at their price point."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. The prosciutto eggs benedict was phenomenal. Wait staff very friendly and attentive. The baked french toast was delicious. I will definitely be going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Servers have always been very good! Food is true to advertising. However, I must say the manager ( female, dark hair) is borderline rude. I expected a bit more from such a highly rated place! The other thing I disliked was how I could see right into the kitchen the last two times we dined there...  Not only did I find that kind of gross but the noise level and footraffic in that area definitely lacked the atmosphere that I had dining in the front of the restaurant. Overall, I enjoyed the food but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Recently my wife suggested for us to try Fork. She heard from a friend that it was a good restaurant. We went for Sunday Brunch. What a surprise. The food was really good.  I had crab cake Eggs Benedict with prosciutto and the fries tossed in cheese were the best ever. I've had fries all over the world and these thus far are the best.  I'm going back today to try the burger with fried egg. Can't wait. So glad to have a good farm to table restaurant here in Lake Norman.   I'll let you know how the burger was."}
{"text":"Great service. Our waiter knew so much about the menu & where all item were from (local). I didn't have reservation so I sat at a high table in the bar area. So keep that in mind. I had the French toast & it was delish. I also had grits also purchased local (I think Matthews) with egg & sausage all local. My new favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"We have been to Fork quite a few times and every time we have been thoroughly impressed. Love the farm to table concept! The restaurant is in an adorable house with a wrap around porch with outdoor seating. They serve dinner thru out the week and brunch on Sunday's. Reservations are recommended although we never have trouble getting a seat without one. We have tried several different Benedict's, scrambles, and biscuits and gravy. Local beers on tap!"}
{"text":"Fork! is an excellent little brunch place in the Cornelius-Davidson area. The restaurant is a bit on the pricier side, but it may be worth it to you because they serve farm to table meals. I had their smoked ham and pesto benedict, which was quite good. I really enjoyed the pesto, which made for a really nice, savory breakfast. The server was also attentive and kept our coffees and waters filled. Even though it was Sunday brunch, we didn't have any wait for a table, which was a great surprise. My only critique is that we sat at a table of two in the room directly to the left when you walk in through the door of the restaurant. For some reason, these tables are diagonal to the rest of the room, which is really, really weird, and definitely distracted me. I wanted to straighten the tables up, so I could focus on my food. Overall, great food and great service! If they straighten the two-person tables, I'll come back and have another great brunch!"}
{"text":"Everything was very good and I would go back again. I would have liked more octopus and spice in the  fettucini appetizer. The waitress had a difficult time describing the Sheepshead fish entree and the description she did give really didn't match the actual fish and my wife diddn't really care for it. The braised short rib was awesome, but the lobster mac & cheese side dish had one small piece of lobster in it. At the price paid for our dinners I would expect more of the featured ingredient in the dish."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Fork! for our first Sunday brunch after moving to Cornelius, and it was well worth it! He got the eggs Benedict and I had the baked french toast with strawberries and blueberries, and they were phenomenal. Lots (if not all) of menu items were locally grown. We made a reservation to be sure we got a table on the porch, but if you get there right after they open for Sunday brunch, there's not much of a crowd."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here before heading to a show in downtown Charlotte one night.  It's rare these days to find a menu with so many fun choices that I have a hard time choosing.  My date solved the problem by ordering 5-6 appetizers as his dinner, so we got to sample our way through the menu.  Really, everything was wonderful.  The goat cheese macaroni, the spring rolls, dumplings -- everything was distinctive and truly tasty.  I went with the lamb and absolutely loved it.  We went because of the farm-to-table ethic and will be back as soon as possible.  The pricing was very reasonable and the interior was warm and comfortable.  Our dining room was cozy and the bar area seemed lively."}
{"text":"Visited with my wife for our anniversary this past weekend.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Started with the chicken spring rolls, which were very good.  The wasabi and plum sauce we sweet and spicy.  My wife ordered the beef tenderloin and really enjoyed it.  It was cooked perfectly to her liking.  I ordered the lamb shank which was \"fall-off-the-bone\" delicious.  Fork has an a-la-carte style menu, so we split the goat cheese mac & cheese and the asparagus side dishes.  The asparagus was perfectly cooked and the mac and cheese was wonderful!  I plan on going back for lunch, just to eat the mac & cheese.  For dessert, we had the sweet potato cheesecake, with homemade, toasted marshmallow.  It was awesome.  Not too sweet and very tasty. Fork also does a nice job with the bar menu.  My wife sampled a few of the fruit martinis and I had a pumpkin ale, from NoDa Brewing.  It was nice to see local brews on the menu.  As for service, our waitress was very nice and attentive.  Her service could not have been better.  There were a couple of things keeping me from a five-star rating.  The host was a little weird and stared at my wife a little to long, so that was a little uncomfortable.  Also, we were seated in the rear dining room (this restaurant is in an old house, so there are multiple dining rooms) where the lighting is awful.  The other rooms and the bar have very soft, warm lighting.  The room we were in had a very cool light fixture made of colored, glass bottles, but for some reason they have a bright white, high efficiency lightbulb in it that makes the whole room feel like it is lit by a florescent shop light.  Harsh lighting and our anniversary did not go hand in hand. I have seen a couple other reviews comment on high prices.  I did not find Fork to be expensive for the quality of the food you get.  You can tell they are using top notch ingredients and the prices are not out of line.  $18.00 for a lamb shank and $23 for beef tenderloin is fine.  The sides are also inexpensive at $3-$5 each.  All told, we ate and drank (3 cocktails, 1 app, 2 entrees, 2 sides and dessert) for under $100.00.  Give Fork a try.  It will only get better as they work the kinks out."}
{"text":"We had the Mac and cheese, ribeye steak.  Not good won't go back.   Very expensive.  It's a fairly new restaurant about a year old.  Staff we're very full of themselves, if you like snooty go for it.  Don't go without a reservation."}
{"text":"Our experience at Fork was pretty good, but for the prices I expected more. The short ribs were great, though my husband and I requested to share and I expected them to split the meal in the kitchen, rather than ask if I wanted an extra plate when they brought the food and i mentioned that we wanted to share. The lobster risotto was room temperature, and our wine glasses weren't offered a refill (we didn't ask once the server came back because at that point the meals were done).   I get the feeling it's an inexperienced wait staff, and hopefully they work out some of the kinks. I'm not sure we'll be racing back, nor will we recommend it to others at this point. May be better for bar bites and a drink. Again, it was good, not great."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant online searching for Farm to Table places to eat around Charlotte and this amazing place in Cornelius showed up in the search so we went after dropping the kids off at the grandparents. Man were we glad we found this place. We had to make a reservation as it was recommended and we were glad we did otherwise we would have had to wait at 6:30pm on a Friday. All the food was great but what I will not forget the scallops! I've never had scallops that were so great!! I recommended the place to my parents and they also loved it. We will be eating at Fork! again!  The service was also great and the little house turned into restaurant was great. Love old houses re purposed for restaurants. The only thing I was not a fan of was our table location.... it was a tiny table for 2 in the middle of the room with tables all around us.... It felt like an island and it felt like everyone would be able to hear us and see us but in the end I got over it and the food was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I am here almost 4 times a week.  Best restaurant in Cornelius.  No question.  Great food, great service."}
{"text":"We are not locals, and were in the area and wanted a non-chain restaurant. Went on Yelp, and Fork! popped up, so we took a chance. The location is really cute--it's on a residential street in an old house. Be careful, or you'll miss it! We sat on the porch. It was a great night and because we got there early, we didn't have to wait. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the shrimp \"salad\" (I think they called it something else, but it had veggies, shrimp, heirloom cherry toms, etc.), and I had a signature pear martini. Everything was delicious. The mac and cheese was terrific, and the serving size was very generous. I think Forks! would be pricey if you were having a full dinner, because everything is a la carte and not cheap, but we didn't leave hungry. The food was very fresh and you can tell they take care with everything they prepare. I didn't give it five stars because I think if you're spending fifty+ bucks on your meal, it's reasonable to expect  some kind of complimentary bread or roll.  We will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I really want to love this restaurant but the service just isn't good. The food is delicious if it could come out with consistent temperatures.  We went on a Saturday night and sat outside. Unfortunately they don't have a sever dedicated to outside so they make the poor bartender cover it. She is very nice and tried her best but she was just too busy.  It took over an hour to get our food and when we did my husband's duck was cold!  We sent it back and it came back out cold again. (We gave up at that point). They ask a premium for good quality food which I can understand, but not when it's served cold.  We've been there a few times and each time we have problems with the service."}
{"text":"I'd love to give Fork a higher rating & I would have.....up until we received our check.  Dined with friends on a Sunday night so we assumed we could go without a reservation. After an initial snafu with the host, we were seated in the bar area. Our server was very attentive and friendly and explained the menu in detail to make sure we understood. I loved the idea that Fork uses locally sourced food as much as possible. Had read reviews before visiting so I thought I knew what to expect & then later my husband told me our total bill was $125 (before the tip) for two! What??!! We each had 2 glasses of wine, an appetizer, main dishes, and a side. That being said, the food was delicious, and very fresh. Aside from the small portion of the appetizer, the main dish was a generous helping as was the side. My problem wasn't with the food quality but the rest of the experience itself. For the price of a meal for two people, Fork could up the ante of the rest of the dining experience. For starters, their logo is basically airbrushed graffiti that is hard to read on the sign, especially in the dark. The establishment is housed in a charming old victorian home with small rooms and nothing too fancy on the decor. While the service was good, it was nothing over the top or anyone giving you the feeling that they were bending over backwards to wait on you. As for the host, he almost seemed bothered that more people were showing up. Basically if we're going to spend $125 on a meal in Cornelius, NC it should be a night to remember, it should knock our socks off, etc. My prediction is that Fork will go the same way as the other unsuccessful business in this same location, people will try it once & not return because of the outrageous cost of a meal."}
{"text":"This place has great food. Amazing!!! Love that it is farm to table. Nice cozy environment. Quiet. Perfect portion size. From appetizer to dessert, everything was perfect!!!"}
{"text":"My wife suggested we try Fork for dinner last Friday.  First, the service was the worst we have ever had. Next came our meal. It matched the service dreadful. We had the shrimp appetizer that tasted funny.  We mentioned it to the manager when he came by the table.  He said \"it is suppose to taste that way\". We both felt sick later that evening. Advice on this restaurant.  Buyer beware."}
{"text":"A great find on our road trip from Florida to Pittsburgh. We figured Cornelius NC was a good stopping point. Having our handy iPhone we checked Yelp and found this gem. A restaurant that uses mostly local. From start to finish a satisfying experience. Server sweet and knowledgeable. Started with kale salad with blue cheese and pecans and pork dumplings (my husband and I). Both excellent. Entrees of the NC coast flounder and the scallops. We both opted for the black pepper and sage beurre blanc. Wow! And risotto with carrots and dandelions. Wow again!!!!! A good and affordable wine list. Dessert was a shared salted caramel ice cream sandwich with popcorn. Wish we lived closer. Don't miss it! PS: they even have spare reading glasses....for my husband."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 stars. Good food, good wine, great atmosphere. Goat Cheese Mac was our favorite."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last night and we were really looking forward to an amazing dinner date after reading the review from the Observer.  My husband had made a reservation on open table and when he told the hostess that we had a reservation she looked on her computer screen and said that we did not.  Not a good start.  We were then seated in the bar area and our waitress was very cold and unskilled.  We ordered our bottle of wine and 15 minutes later she was chatting it up with some other customers and another server finally served the wine for her.   We didn't get any bread with our mussels until we were finished.   The hostess came out after we finished our meal to say that we did have a reservation but she had overlooked it.  No kidding.  They had a bunch of ladies that they filled up the dining room with so she lied to appease them.  Bad call.    Food was delicious but when you have poor service in a place of this caliber it ruins the entire dining experience.    We will not be back."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a delicious dinner here last night! We had a 7:00p reservation and were seated right away. The staff were friendly and polite. The food was fantastic! Tuna carpacchio, the salads, the seafood (choose your sauce), the side dishes, and the desserts ... all different and delicious! Good wine and beer list and a nice ambiance. Yes, it can be pricey if you order as much as we did (everything's ala carte) and it can get noisy (a large party in our room got boisterous as the evening went along) but I encourage you to eat here soon because the food is so good!"}
{"text":"Super cute farm to table restaurant. Loved the feel of the restaurant and the food was delicious...only complaint is that we wanted more of the wonderful food !"}
{"text":"So we kept hearing from friends this was the place to be. The food definitely did not disappoint. Everything was cooked to perfection. Only complaint was our food did not come out at the same time. Apparently there was a mix up in the kitchen with our order. While we had to eat our dinners separately they were both really good. Will give it another try, as we liked the atmosphere and quaintness of the restaurant in a small house. Tight quarters so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids or large parties, but perfect size for a date night."}
{"text":"It was a crowded Saturday night and the dining room, bar and porch all had a very warm, homey feel.  The hostess and bartenders were friendly and gracious.  Our waitress, Katie was awesome.  Very sweet and attentive.  So far so good.  Unfortunately the meal was only so-so and WAY! not worth the price.  The pork dumplings tasted off, bitter and just not tasty at all.  I love dumplings.  But not these.  The spring rolls were good and the wasabi and sweet sauce were nice compliments.   My date and I split the flounder special.  It was two thin filets with garnish.  The fish was dried out, overcooked and the pan seared buttery taste was vague at best.  At $20 a la cart, very disappointing.  And with two sides that they call \"extras\", probably to remind people you have to pay extra for them, the meal totaled $32 (minus the appetizers and wine) and while the sides, sorry, extras, were ok, the overall quality and value of this meal was poor.  The people of Fork! were Great! and they were the only reason I didn't give it 1 star.  Very disappointing as we were really! looking forward to trying Fork!  To paraphrase and honor the late baseball legend and war hero Yogi Berra,  \"When you get to the Fork! in the road, DONT take it.\""}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good service... The food came out in a timely manner I just thought it lacked in seasoning... Its worth a second try.."}
{"text":"The food you get is very good; the question is just how much you are going to get.  A group of four of us went to try it out.  Between the four of us we ordered three beers, one appetizer, three entrees, four sides and one dessert.  Total bill was around $150.  The food was very good, but the portions were inconsistent.  The crab cake appetizer was one small crab cake.  Two of the side dishes (which were supposed to be family style) were very small portions while the fries were huge.  Two people ordered the same entree but they were different sizes and came out on different plates. For a meal in this price range, I would expect more consistency from the kitchen.  All in all, it was good but at this price I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Finally tried Fork! 1/2/14 looking for a creative, fresh, foodie experience nearer to us than Charlotte or South Park.  Our first move was NOT to sit at the tiny two-top offered in what appeared to be a pretty bright room. The bar seating area was nicely/warmly lit and we cozied up with a local craft beer and Napa cabernet.  Melinda was friendly and knowledgeable. The menu operates mostly a la carte, much like another favorite of ours, Roosters, with standard and daily offerings.  We shared and loved: fried oysters, a cheese/beet salad, parmesan fries, lamb shank, sea trout and two sides made with collards and kale. Bread pudding with NO RAISINS (yes!) and pecan cheesecake were great. Got what we paid for--GREAT FOOD, drink, service."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for anniversary dinner. Incredible food, incredible service. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"2 words--consistently excellent. Have been here over ten times.  Excellent fish.  Fresh, flavorful sides.  Good  wine and beer selection.  Solid service.  I highly recommend Fork!"}
{"text":"We went with kids on a Tuesday night (their not too busy night) and they seated us in a dining room by ourselves so we did not feel stressed about the kids running around.  The food was delicious and the wait staffs are super friendly and cheerful.  It was a lovely experience."}
{"text":"Dinner here is all about the food.  Locally sourced everything was prepared perfectly.  The restaurant is an old house with little rooms creating a quaint feeling of being in someone's private dining room, very charming.  The waiter was not as exceptional.  Several questions on seasonings went unanswered, ideas for teenage boys' appetites were befuddling, and accommodations for gluten free requests prompted a run to the kitchen.   The toughest and noisiest snafu was the replenishing of the ice cooler as we were trying to enjoy our food and make conversation.   The tab for 6 of us was $180 inc. tip---no alcohol or dessert.  The food was wonderful, but when you hit that price point, the finer points of dining become mandatory."}
{"text":"Hard to give this place two stars. Scallops were good so I will stretch. Otherwise this place was awful! Two waitresses got into a scuffle at our table about whether or not the salmon was wild caught. The food took over an hour and a half  to get to the table. The asparagus was cold but had a burnt taste. Weird! The appetizers were TINY! We ordered three for six people but they would only serve one each. It aw like a comedy show...how bad can we make this experience? When I informed the manager how long we were waiting for our food he explained he had a printer problem and said \"the food might have taken a minute longer than it should have\" oh my gosh! He was clueless! Will NEVER go back and this place is in my back yard. Oh yeah, should mention that they gave us 10% off our bill. Who cares? If it had not been for the company of great friends last night would have been a disaster!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Our service was deplorable.  We received a lackluster greeting from our server, and a bad attitude throughout our meal.  Our server was clearly never trained in customer service. 20 minutes after we ordered our apps and dinner my friend was approached by our server who said \"we are out of what you ordered. We've switched to brisket. Do you want that instead?\" No apology, just attitude. We should have had food on the table at that point. My friend asked for other options and asked to have another entree at the same price. The server mentioned a $3 difference. Said she'd check. The answer was no. For $3 that situation could've been turned around immediately. Instead it helped the whole experience roll down hill. Then when we finally received our appetizers, one of which was mussels, we asked another server who delivered a drink for some bread. She nicely replied of course. She didn't follow through. So when we saw our server again we asked for bread and received a response with an attitude \"ill heat some up for you\". The Mussels were gone by the time we received our bread. And at the end of the meal my friend noticed on his check that the wine he ordered was $2 more than listed. He asked the server who again, with an attitude said \"oh yea we were out of what you ordered so I picked another one for you. Well didn't  you enjoy it?\" NOT THE POINT! At this point I think she caught on that we were over the entire experience and she should've handled things differently, because when she brought the check t be signed she said \"I took care of the wine.\" And that was it. It wasn't about the money. It was about taking care of the guest which the entire experience was missing. We would've appreciated a manager visit. We were discussing how disappointed we were while a hostess cleaned the tables around us. She heard us. But I guess no one there cared enough to follow up with us about our experience. It's a shame..the food was delicious."}
{"text":"The food is interesting and usually pretty amazing!  Service is good to exceptional.   Nice place to catch up with an old friend or go on a date-night.   Bartender crafts good quality cocktails.   Can't recommend this place enough if you are into food."}
{"text":"Another one of those trendy farm to table restaurants that serve pretty good food at really high prices then charge for a side. An after dinner cordial at the bar will cost you $10. This place needs to reduce the size of their dinnerware - not their portions."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place more stars, but honestly, I have to compare this establishment to \"better\" restaurants.  I ordered the Wahoo with the beets/turnip side dish.   Strike 1 - when serving any root vegetables they need to be thoroughly washed. Having any dirt on them causes that grit sound in my mouth that is quite unpleasant.  Strike 2 - The flavor on the beets/turnips was uneven in the sense that some of the items were strongly vinegar flavored and others were good. Single - The Wahoo was pan seared and nicely seasoned. I thought the pairing with the fennel was good."}
{"text":"To earn my first review on Yelp says something... Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon Fork through UrbanSpoon.   I must say, the quaint house style setting at this farm-to-fork style restaurant was lovely. The wait staff was great. The house even had a little character with a floors being just ever so slightly slanted.   But the food...oh the food. Our party had the Lamb Shank, Beef Tenderloin, and the catch of the day, Tilefish. The Lamb was falling off the bone delicious. Steak cooked to perfection. Tilefish vanished from the plate.   The side of asparagus and Lobster Mac N' Cheese was also spectacular. I can't say enough great things about the place. Definitely earned a repeat customer if I'm ever in town again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Fresh, clean, and creative. One of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at, and I have been there over 15 time lol. Never a disappointment"}
{"text":"Had the scallops in brown buyer sauce and goat cheese mac & cheese - delicious! But the wait was long - apparently you shouldn't order mac & cheese unless you have a good hour to just hang out - we arrived at the restaurant at 6:30 & felt rushed to eat our dinner by the time it arrived at 7:30 so we could make an 8:00 play. We'll go again for a special occasion when we don't have any other plans for the night."}
{"text":"Our dining experience at Fork last night was a first class experience.  We sat on the porch which was very quaint.  Our server, Mary, was efficient and extremely helpful.  This was the first time we dinned here, and we were hoping for a unique experience.  She offered suggestions for food and wine and everyone was quite pleased with the taste and quality of our food.  Forks is definitely on our list as a return restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. The service was really attentive and nice, but the food was overall unremarkable. We were in for Sunday brunch and ordered the Herb & Cheddar biscuit app which was $3 for ONE normal sized biscuit, no bueno. It came with butter, apple butter, and honey which is really weird with a herb and cheddar biscuit. You need a savory whipped butter or cream cheese with that. My sister ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich and the waffle just didn't taste like much of anything. Some vanilla and nutmeg would've went a long way toward making it more delicious.  I had the gravy and biscuits which weren't bad seasoning wise but needed a little less oil as it was separating in the plate. A surprisingly good thing was the grits. Overall, they have potential but need to polish their food a bit to bring it up to the level of what I would expect of a farm-to-table restaurant in this area."}
{"text":"Mixed opinion on Fork. My husband ordered the lamb and it was fall of the bone tender and delicious. I ordered the Scottish salmon with chimmichurri sauce. It had a beautiful golden brown crisp top, but It came out without the sauce and worst of all was raw inside. I didn't find out until I got a mouthful of cool slimy salmon. The waitress quickly returned it to heat it properly and when she returned, the sauce had been added and it was very delicious. If I don't get food poisoning I may give Fork another try, but that certainly wasn't the best first impression."}
{"text":"Best brunch in the Lake Norman area.  Not there is that much competition.  It is a quaint little restaurant nestled in an old house on highway 115.  There isn't a whole lot of room inside, so the tables are packed pretty tight.  Knowing this, we went ahead and made reservations, just in case.  First off we got the house made mozzarella ball, with pesto and cherry tomatoes.  It is only available at Sunday brunch.  Great fresh mozzarella.  A little peppery arugula too top it off.  When it came down to actually ordering, me and my date both wanted a benedict.  And since there were 2 of them, we just decided to get both and split em.  I got the crab meat with prosciutto.  I made the right choice.  With a super citrusy hollandaise to brighten up the whole dish, I was impressed.  At $9, it was a steal.  My counterpart ordered the other benedict with asparagus and goat cheese.  Both were borderline too rich, but both still very much worth the price.  Add a couple mimosa's to that and I'd call that a great brunch.  Bottom line:  I'll be back, probably many times."}
{"text":"We came in for brunch, and it was absolutely delicious! I've been in once before for cocktails and have had it on my bucket list to come back in for brunch and/ or dinner since their menu is so farm to fork and varies often.   I went with the grass fed burger and it was delicious! The thin hand cut fries were great too, although I feel slightly skimped  by the amount I got with my burger. The chicken and waffles was awesome and blew my mind with how flavorful it was. Dipped in syrup, you have the perfect combo of sweet and savory. The fried chicken was superb.   I was a little disappointed with the Bloody Mary. I think it could have used a little more spice and vodka! As always, I recommend sitting on the beautiful, expansive front porch and enjoying the sunshine. The service was quick and our server seemed pretty knowledgable about be dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome little place with plenty of character, good service, and great food.  This is right up there with Kindred.  I love that they have a small rotating menu with plenty of specials.  The brazed rib was as good as it gets, and the sides were terrific too.  I loved the vegatables in risotto.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch a while back and had a nice time. We were seated outside though on a hot day so didn't exactly get to relax during the meal cuz we were all ready to go pretty fast. But we also didn't make reservations which is a must for this place for brunch at least. Had the eggs Benedict which was great. Husband had an omelette which he liked and got his extra crispy potatoes. Overall good food, expected prices and recommend reservations!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot - atmosphere is inviting and homey, modern and chic. Service is so welcoming and hospitable and quick! Food was so delicious - cooked to perfection. This is a gem.  Everything is sourced by local farms daily so the food is fresh with new menu items everyday. Real food and fresh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our way home when we spontaneously stopped here for a bite to eat a few weeks ago. We didn't have a reservation and were seated right away. The inside is very nice and cozy.  The small menu made it easier to make our selections. I ordered the beef special with a side roasted veggies and my husband the lamb shank with asparagus. Both were absolutely delicious, although I enjoyed my beef much more.  The prices are on the higher side especially since the sides are extra however, it was worth every penny. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great setting. Fresh amazing food. I always order benedicts everywhere and hands down Phil's Benedict is my favorite ever. Favorite brunch can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Some reviews have mentioned how pricy Fork is. It's true that Fork can add up quickly if you order an entree and some wine; however, I would consider this a moderately priced restaurant overall.  Entrees range from the high teens to the high 20s. Small plates and sides for sharing can cost as little as five bucks to as much as $11 or $12. You can make a meal of small plates or have one generously portioned main dish. Or you can do a little bit of both. There is a way to work with all budgets here.  And whatever you choose, you will not be disappointed. The food is excellent. We opted to try their small plates and some sides, mostly daily specials. We got the parmesan shoestring fries, truffle mac and cheese, crimson and golden watermelon salad with pickled green beans and Carolina brie, fettuccine with golden chanterelles and fava beans in a butter broth, heirloom tomatoes and cucumber salad, and shrimp creole.  All dishes were stunning and clever. We loved how the chef(s?) really highlighted the \"farm-to-fork\" ingredients. The creamy, luscious ingredients, like Carolina brie, really brought of the sweetness and freshness of the watermelon. The umami mushrooms' texture and the fava beans' green color brightened up the pasta dish. Even the shoestring fries were awesome (and a huggggggge portion). And the truffle mac and cheese, at five bucks, was the best deal on the menu ever-rich, decadent, again umami, and comforting--everything you could possibly ask for in a mac and cheese.   Just a note: Located inside a bungalow-style home with a porch, Fork seems casual enough, but there's a genteel feel to the place. A few people, including my hubby, came in with shorts, but most diners were dressed business casual or dressy. Seems like a special occasion kinda place. The atmosphere made me think of Charleston restaurants, like Husk. Thankfully, the service was polite but not stuffy. Would suggest you come in smart casual clothes, if you decide to give this place a try.  Definitely a great dining experience near Davidson College. If you're looking for a business that makes great use of local ingredients in an upscale setting, Fork is a stellar choice. And the price is right, if you ask me."}
{"text":"I took my 94 year old mother here for an early Mother's Day dinner. The restaurant is in an old house and has parking in the back. The food was creative and delicious and our server Anthony was informative and attentive. We started with the pork dumplings.  These were full of shredded pork with a wonderful slaw and topped with tiny balls of jellied soy sauce - very spicy and delicious, though more meat than dumpling. We split a lamb shank entree and accompanied it with the asparagus/beet side and sweet potato fingerlings. The sweet potatoes were topped with a drizzle of sorghum molasses and Mom could not get enough of them. We  both agreed that the lamb was fantastic. The roasted asparagus were topped with only one tiny beet seedling, but were tasty. For dessert, we ordered the cornbread with honeysuckle Creme anglaise, a yummy combination. The restaurant focuses on preparing food from local sources, and the menu lists many of the sources. Hats off to the chef and wait staff for a great dining experience. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Have been here several times when I travel to charlotte area. One of my favorite restaurants, not just charlotte but anywhere. So many restaurants pretend to be farm to table. This is the real thing. Delicious, wonderfully prepared, changing menu. Wish this place was on my hometown."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, just take some time and make it. Headed there for Sunday brunch and was very happy. We had one under seasoned lobster Mac and cheese & it was promptly replaced with the correct balance of spices. Super yummy!!! Fried egg Benedict was great & French toast were perfect. Shout out to the bartender, she put her love into that pisco punch! Will return to try other items!"}
{"text":"I give credit to the chef because the food was great. It's too bad that the waitress tried to sneak something by me in the bill. It will stop me from returning. You're only as good as your frontline staff when it comes to overall experience."}
{"text":"To die for. Great atmosphere and the food is as fresh as it could possibly be. One of my favorites in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Went for date night. We had reservations and opted to sit outside on the front porch. I'm a particular fan of restaurants that are in what used to be a regular home. I think the concept is so fun. They have an a la carte menu which gives a lot of options. We started with the chicken egg rolls as our appetizer. Let me just say, they were DELISH! My man got the chicken and I ordered the Cobia dish. Megan was our server and she was great. Never made us feel rushed and was helpful with the menu. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is for the setting and the price, the food was not as to-die-for as I would have maybe hoped. Nonetheless, still yummy and the restaurant is adorable. We will definitely go again :-)"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. Traveling home from CLT and who knew this little gem was tucked away near Davidson? We had a dinner of small plates: warm veggie salad, beets/greens, lobster mac, asparagus and mussels. Delish. Plenty for 2 and under $35 (no wine as we were driving, but still a nice value for real food). It's not easy to find fresh food these days. I hope this place does well.  PS- slow-ish service so don't hurry. Also, seemed like it could make a fairly romantic evening, unless, of course, you're on a road trip....."}
{"text":"We had a great dining experience at Fork! The vegetable sides were delicious. I like the ordering system, but it can get a bit pricey if you want to try multiple items and order a protein. The goat cheese mac n cheese was creamy, but needed a little salt. The halibut was cooked perfectly. The specialty cocktails were delicious--I always love a spicy margarita. It's cool how creative they get with the daily specials.. and honestly all of them were absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Great little place, great atmosphere, great service, spectacular grub!"}
{"text":"Just had a great experience here! Excellent food, Very fresh and delicious. Amelia took such great care of us and we can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Face it, there are just a few things that are inarguably done better in The South: BBQ, fried things (most notably chicken), and breakfast, or as the oft varied interpretation of it is known, brunch. You folks up North can keep your bagels and lox, West coasters will enjoy avocados and egg whites, but I'll die happy with a belly full of biscuits and gravy. Based on our meal here, I'm sure that a regular dinner or lunch would be equally fantastic, but it was so nice to get a wonderful Southern inspired breakfast/brunch on the way out of NC as we drove back to DC. It's so difficult to find in my home up here that I'm glad I get to return back to my old home enough to really savor how special it is.  We had a reservation for this meal, but had set it for 1PM mainly because we were driving in from my parents farm out in the boonies and had no idea how long the rest of our morning errands would take before we arrived. We wound up getting there much closer to noon, but luckily the wait wasn't too bad on an otherwise very busy Sunday and they were able to clear off our table only 10 or 15 minutes after waiting in the foyer of the beautifully restored home that Fork resides in. Since we had a long drive ahead of us we had to forego any brunch drinks, although those we saw drinking seemed to really be enjoying themselves, always a good sign. Our waitress couldn't believe the size of our order, assuring us that the dishes we large, but I equally assured her that I rarely walk away from a table with empty plates.  Since I knew we would be trying to have a large brunch I had previously turned down my dad's sausage biscuits and gravy at home that morning before we headed out. It's one of the few things he excels at making in the kitchen, so the standard is pretty high. I ordered Fork's herb biscuits and gravy with \"wild turkey farm sausage\", hoping for a nice substitute. I wasn't clear from the description if the sausage was turkey based, came from a farm called Wild Turkey, or what exactly the descriptor meant. Whatever the case, the sausage flavor was pretty bland, not nearly the spicy, flavorful kind I grew up eating, and it didn't add a whole lot to the dish. It was still good, but I regretted not having that at home since I only get the chance about twice a year, at most. They do top it with a poached egg, something I could never get at my parents' house, where egg yolk is an abnormality...that added a nice bit of depth to the gravy. the biscuits themselves were the best part, the right amount of firmness to not get too soggy with lots of gravy, but still tender enough to fold in your mouth.  The other main items we ordered were things less frequently made at home, a shrimp and grits dish with chorizo gravy and spinach, and baked french toast with maple syrup, mascarpone mousse, and apples. Each of these provided substantially more surprises flavors than the biscuits and gravy, and I would highly recommend either to folks who might be coming here for brunch. The shrimp were plentiful in that dish, and the portion size to price ratio was outstanding. I also really loved the texture of the baked french toast. I'm not sure I've ever had it prepared that way, but it helped keep the dish warm and fluffy throughout, and some bits had really nice carmelization as a result. We also got a side of hash browns, which looked more like \"home fries\" to me than what I typically refer to as hash browns (the diced variety). The irregularity of what you get from this term is somewhat frustrating, but I suppose I should have asked before ordering. They were ok, but just kind of plain compared to the other items we ordered.  The chef here has been one of the biggest proponents of local farm sourcing for ingredients in the Charlotte area, and it really shows in the freshness of the ingredients. Sometimes it might sound overblown, but when you compare these brunch dishes to some of the other similar offerings at more generic places, there is an undeniable difference in the taste of the product, and that's not all due to what's happening in the kitchen. If time allows it, we'll definitely be returning to this cute little restaurant for dinner on a future visit back home."}
{"text":"Our party of four had a great dinner at Fork, my new favorite place in the Cornelius/Davidson area. This is a  delicious, creative local farm to table restaurant with moderate prices. Brandy, our server, made several good recommendations from the Cuvee wine and special house drinks to small plates and side items. She had a good sense of humor and was fun and attentive without being intrusive. Although the menu changes, we enjoyed the brisket with mole and tamale, the roasted broccoli and beets, the risotto with roasted veggies, and the Thai - inspired chicken. The goat cheese mac and cheese was to die for. There are lots of great choices on the menu. We'll be back to try more  plus dessert and to see Brandy again. You'll like the big front porch and the intimate atmosphere,too."}
{"text":"I thought the food was good and reasonably priced for it to be farm to table and a la carte. I really love how the majority of the farms the food comes from are very local (within 30 miles), except the pickled ramps which come from Asheville. I also love how they list the farms on the menu. I had the salmon off of their daily menu and it was cooked perfectly and paired with the burre blanc sauce which was great. The lobster mac and cheese could have used larger pieces of lobster but it was delicious and the portion size was right for the price.  I also had the strawberry  and feta salad off of their special menu. It had a little too much garlic but otherwise I thought it was food. I really liked how the restaurant was small and quaint but I don't think that it's conducive for large parties. We had 8 in our party and our table in the back was a bit tight and cramped.  I also appreciated that the restaurant didn't automatically add on the 18% gratuity for large parties. I hate that but I know why it's often done with large parties. I do believe that it's a great date spot."}
{"text":"Great meal. Food was excellent and the service was fabulous. Portion size was very good. Looking forward to next time."}
{"text":"Scott was our server-Amazing.  Highly professional, engaging and fun.   He made great suggestions all through the meal and really made sure we had a great time.  The food was excellent are artfully prepared.  We'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fork was absolutely amazing!  The honey was delicious. The food was so great but the best part was our waitress who hails from Connecticut!  She made the visit there warm and welcoming. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As Lake Norman area residents, we often go into Charlotte for Farm to Table and more inventive restaurant options. That is no longer the case since Fork! joined the LKN dining scene. We have always had consistently good food with nice seasonal variations. The wine list is impressive and the hand-crafted cocktails are always worthwhile. The price point is excellent. We celebrated our wedding anniversary there November 5 and had some of the best service we've had at a restaurant in years courtesy of Dave. A wonderful gem in the Lake Norman area."}
{"text":"Just egh. Food is pretty good, service was slow and borderline rude. Much better options around."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and I can't say enough good stuff about our waiter and food. The salmon, grits with eggplant & corn and risotto was amazing. A friend and I spit the meal and it was plenty. FYI it was 2 girls that split dinner, it wouldn't not be enough to split with my husband.  We tried brunch today because we heard it was amazing. I can't say the same about the food nor the waitress today, but we will give brunch another try."}
{"text":"Went to fork for maybe the 5th time or so, since I live in Cornelius. We were out with another couple and arrived for our 8:00 reservation on a Saturday evening. The service was great.   At about 10:00, the server came over to us an told us that she apologizes, but she had been asked to close the check so that she could be cut...no problem. We still had some drinks that were pretty full and we didn't need to order anything else, so we were chatting and finishing our drinks. At 10:30, the manager comes over to our table and tells us that we need to wrap up and leave. Wait...what?!?! One of us still had a half glass of wine and it was a Saturday. Not to mention, our bill was over $300...so it wasn't like we weren't bringing them some business. We obliged, but I wasn't happy about it. We did leave without incident though, as I didn't want to make the others feel awkward. I have NEVER been asked to leave a restaurant...that isn't the nature of the business. Fork!, you are on our time when we are there, that is the nature of the business.  To top it off, got home and took a better look at the bill...They charged me $2.00 for the ice in each of our Basil Hayden bourbons...all six of them ($12.00) for ice! It wasn't any kind of sphere or purified ice...just ice! WTH? Another first for me!  That being said, the food was good that night, but they were out of a lot of the dishes (as is the norm) and I would avoid the duck breast (very dry.)  All in all...I will probably look elsewhere in the future for my higher end meals in town...which is too bad."}
{"text":"Our meal was forking good!  We arrived on a Friday night, after 6pm. We weren't sure if they were open because the inside of this cozy restaurant looked dark from the outside. As we got closer, we could see people moving through the window, so we proceeded. Parking is available behind the restaurant.   The old house the restaurant took the place of is adorable. You can tell it's been preserved through the years. Although they have updated it, they have managed to keep its charm. It also has a nice, romantic ambiance. We didn't have reservations, but were seated immediately. The place was busy, but not full. The host was friendly.  Our server was Toni. She too, was friendly. She was also knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire meal. She made great suggestions.  Started with drinks. I told Toni I like sweet wines, but even their sweetest wine wasn't sweet enough for me. She suggested a fruity drink. The name started with \"Winter.\" I failed to take a picture of the seasonal drink menu. It was strong yet sweet. It was composed of rum, prosecco and cherry juice. I enjoyed it. My SO ordered a Boulevardier and was pleased with how it turned out. He ordered a second one halfway through the meal.  We tried: North Carolina Cheese Plate - $9 Pickled Beet & Romaine Salad - $8.5 Oven Roasted Mahi with Caper Aioli on the side - $21 Pan Seared Sheepshead with Orange Herb Vinaigrette - $22 Roasted Celery Root - $4.5 Roasted Red Turnips - $4 Risotto (broccoli, baby carrots, kale) - $4.50 Goat Cheese Mac & Cheese - $7.50 Chocolate Oblivion, white chocolate crumble - $6 Vanilla Pot de Crème - $6  Cheese plate was good. It came with three different kinds of cheese. We liked the local jam that it came with. It must have been apple butter. I didn't try the beet salad, but my SO seemed to enjoy it. He finished it. The ingredients looked fresh. The mahi and sheepshead were excellent! Cooked to perfection and flavored well. I'm not usually a fan of orange flavored sauces, but my SO ordered the orange herb vinaigrette with his sheepshead and I must admit, the flavors went great together. My mahi was thick. Cooked through, but opaque in the center. It had great flavor even without the aioli. I only used a little bit.   I've always wanted to try a goat cheese mac and theirs did not disappoint. It was creamy, but not heavy and tastes just like what you would expect a goat cheese mac to taste like. The risotto on the other hand was a bit disappointing. Our server, Toni sold us on it. She was very confident we would like it, but it turned out being one of our least favorites during the meal. The texture was fine, the rice was cooked al dente. However, it wasn't creamy enough and the flavor was lacking. I don't doubt the other daily risottos are as amazing as she claims. The roasted turnips were hidden under a pile of mustard greens. They were delicious. I didn't think any of the sides could top the main dish, but the roasted celery root proved me wrong! It was ahhhmazing! I would come back over and over just for a bowl of roasted celery root. It came with a horseradish bread crumb and a delightful sauce. I couldn't get over how good it was. I talked about the dish the next day. My mouth is watering as I type this.  For dessert, we tried the chocolate oblivion and the vanilla pot de crème. The chocolate oblivion was very rich. It reminded us of chocolate fudge. Not what I expected, but it satisfied our sweet tooth. The vanilla pot de crème was, as the name implies, creamy. It was light and not too sweet. I combined both desserts and liked them better together.  Our total came to $130+. A bit pricey for two people, but the food was fresh and delicious. Plus, everything is à la cart. They are advertised as a farm to table restaurant. They even give credit to the farms and farmers they use on their menu. Service was great from start to finish. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gem. We happened to come upon this beautiful place in our search for a decent meal at a late hour. (10 pm) They were welcoming and delightful! We had small plates- to try a variety of things- and we were NOT disappointed! The food was so fresh it truly as if it was all made to order. The pasta was fresh. The tomatoes were just picked. The  iced tea was even the best we'd had all week! Our waitress (we forgot her name- sorry ) was the nicest, sweetest southern belle and helped my husband with his strict dietary needs even at a late hour.  We were just hoping to get a clean place to eat and we got so much more. If we ever come back through we will absolutely stop at Fork!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"A cute and warming atmosphere with excellent food to back it up. You can never go wrong with their grass fed burger or their fried eggs benedict. I am a returning costumer and will continue to be one. If looking for a great farm to table brunch, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here for dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was a great choice. Service and the food we ordered were on point. One of these best food experiences in the LKN area we had. Our server was knowledgeable and when he was not 100% sure, he would go and find out. Atmosphere was nice, very homey. Miscellaneous decor. Wasn't really sure on the theme of it but it works I suppose. The inside temperature of the place wasn't too cold or too hot which is a big deal for me. If I'm not comfortable then most likely I will not enjoy eating my meal. Each dish was flavorful and surprisingly filling for the \"small\" (but totally my size) portion they serve. They source most of their foods locally and make all their foods in-house. You can understand how seriously and committed they are to serve by over presentation and taste. I went with their seasonal menu and ordered their Foy Mushroom salad as an appetizer that I shared with my husband and pan-seared Hawaiian Opah with their chile basil sauce. SO Yum."}
{"text":"Two things that definitely tickle my fancy when it comes to a cute romantic dinner is a restaurant in a converted house and a place that supports local farmers and fresh ingredients. My experience at Fork! was okay but my first impression is not the best. The service, ambience, and parking were fine. It was the food that I did not enjoy. I found many of their dishes to be too salty. Let me elaborate and disclose first that I am more sensitive to the amount of salt in foods than most people. In addition, I did order scallops and obviously those tend to be salty. However, if I run across one dish that tends to be overly salty, especially a seafood dish, that is okay, but every dish we ordered that night was too salty for me. My aversion to salt is usually not severe enough for me to disclose to staff and chef that I do not want salt. I usually have no complaints at the level of salt at most restaurants. I had the scallops, hickory smoked pork dumplings, and lima bean mushroom side dish (that came off another menu) and all three were not pleasant. I will provide another point of view. My boyfriend did not mind the salt content of the dumplings and thought they were wonderful but he did agree that the scallops and lima bean mushroom side were too salty. In addition, his fish dish was not very salty and therefore I intruded on his meal and took most of it. It may have been a one-time occurrence or maybe that is how they like to season."}
{"text":"The portions were miniscule, the prices too high, and the seating/ambience too tight.  Presentation was not up to the hype.  The flavor and quality of the food was good, though."}
{"text":"Great Sunday Brunch  We've been to Fork! before but never for the Sunday Brunch.  Our loss because it was great.  Generally packed so we took the step of placing an on line reservation which while not necessary, did help for immediate seating when we showed up at the appointed 11:45 time.  Very creative menu and my wife settled on a Crab and Proscuitto Benedict while I had the more tradional steak 9tenderloin) and eggs along with a side of Hashbrowns and Toast.  Both were excellent. Very well prepared and the presentation was excellent.  Coffee was outstanding as well.  Service was excellent and while a bit small, it reminds me of some of the small restaurants in Biloxi or Key West that I so love.  Only advise is that parking is limited so come early to find a good spot"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to eat here at Fork. We called ahead and made a reservation, got lucky! I always thought that this restaurant was only for brunch and lunch but when I read tiff reviews I was surprised to find out that I was wrong. We liked the homey ambiance and friendly hostess and waiter. Our waiter was very attentive and polite.  I selected the Scottish salmon with roasted cauliflower and my wife had the brisket with Mac-n-cheese. We were very happy with both. The salmon was cooked perfectly as well as the brisket, it was real tender.  We did not order dessert but the selection looked amazing. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Fork brunch is the best in the Davidson area. With new specials every Sunday, there are also some classics that stick around every week. You can't go wrong with any order but the biscuits are a great way to start. My personal favorite is the chicken and waffle sandwich. If you like waffles or fried chicken, do not come for brunch without getting this dish."}
{"text":"So evidently this place is 'cursed.'  Hopefully the restaurant gods will smile on Fork.  The building has been through several hands in the last few years.  The ambiance is quite lovely and it was a 60 degree day (in Feb - I love NC weather!)  - had it been a few degrees warmer it would have been nice to sit on the veranda.  Today we went in for brunch.  The food looked very yummy, but was maybe just slightly above average.  I had the french toast.  The baked apples on top were by far the best part of the dish.  The brioche was very mealy.  It was strange, tasted almost cornbread-ish.  The bacon was on point, but only two slices for $3 bucks.  The hashbrowns were good, but nothing special.  I was with a party of 6 and I didn't hear anyone raving about their food.  No one was complaining either so in my book that puts this place solidly in the 3 star category.  I've had a handful of brunch places with better food, but by far I've had way more places that are worse.    Interestingly enough I found the prices to be OK to slightly high - but my bill was really really low.  I don't know why."}
{"text":"My husband and I were very pleasantly surprised with our meal at Fork!  They had some great craft beers on tap, including Green Man's ESB, which is one of our favorites.   We like the a la carte style of the menu, where you can essentially make a meal that is tailored to your liking. The food was fresh, the sauces were flavorful and unique.  The truffle mac & cheese was creamy and decadent.  The interior is charming, warm and inviting.  We would definitely go back.    The one suggestion I would offer is that they get a new logo and a new sign for out front.  The logo they have chosen looks like it is something out of a 1990's sitcom, not a refined, farm-to-fork restaurant.  It looks like sloppy graffiti done by a child and it's not attractive at all from the road. It was enough to really turn us off from trying the place for a while."}
{"text":"I waited a week before writing this to re-evaluate my thoughts. Love the decor, friendly and attentive bar before dinner. The food was great once they got it right. Had to send back our meals twice. Raw steak first round, incorrect seasonings etc. staff was very friendly and perhaps I did not care so much since I had a few cocktails first and was in good company  I'll give Fork another try soon"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am not accustom to dropping $85 for a meal unless it is a special occasion.   This is a very high priced joint.   Notice I did not say overpriced, you are paying for a premium.   This is all local food, wine and craft beer.   In fact, if you look at the supplier list, they are all at the Davidson Farmers Market.    Okay, here we go.   Nothing about Fork is average.   Ultra classy and upscale.   The setting in the old house, front room bar and outside wrap around porch dining are perfect.  The staff rates top notch.  Awesome setting for a romantic date.  Food.  My fellow Yelpers, I read most of the reviews and ordered exactly what everyone recommended.   Spicy chicken eggroll, pork chop and lobster mac n cheese.   I even got a side of ghost chili.  I can honestly say 100% without a doubt, it was the most tender, juicy and flavorful thick cut pork chop that I have ever had the privilege of devouring.  The ghost chili rocked my world, on a scale of hotness 1 to 10, it was a 15.  Eggroll just spoiled me, the local Chinese aint got nothing on it.   The lobster mac n cheeses had cheesy flavor explosions on my taste buds.  Sadly I will not go back, but I will miss it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, WOW, ok here it goes, staff was professional and made us feel important, they are the definition of courteous . Our server named Double D, Dottie Davis, not what your thinking, lol is as beautiful as the presentation of all our delectable choices, which was well coerced , or otherwise strongly suggested for us to try, awesomeness and thankful, because the experience is spot on, kudos to the chef, owner and everyone who helped influence them to give us this wonderful experience, and of course I highly recommend this place...."}
{"text":"Good food however long wait for food, 50 mins. No bread at table. Portions are very small so be prepared as i did, and have a pizza after dinner. Waitress very very nice 2 small meals ( snacks)  came to $82 with tip plus the pizza i had to get on my way home cause I was still hungry. Eat before you go so you wont be hungry."}
{"text":"We went there for Sunday brunch, didn't know that we had to have reservations. We got lucky and was able to get  a table at the bar. The service was OK and so was the food."}
{"text":"The fella and I ventured north for a Cornelius day that ended at Fork!. I was so incredibly impressed that I'll start with the only negative thing so that I can end on many, many positive notes.  I ordered the pork chop, which was one of the daily specials, and our waitress didn't ask how I wanted it cooked. It came out medium to medium well, so it was chewier than I like; I usually order medium rare. But that was the only negative, so on with the review!  The place itself is so cute and quaint. If it had been just a little cooler outside, I would've picked outdoor seating, but we sat inside on the main floor. We were there at 6:30 on a Saturday, and there was only one other group in our room. Even when another couple got seated as we were wrapping up, it still didn't feel too stuffy/tight as other reviewers have suggested because the place is pretty lively, but not so lively that you can't hear the people you're with.  Our waitress, Mary, was amazing. The fella and I are great at narrowing down and horrible at choosing, so we let her do all the choosing, and she was spot on.   Smoked pork dumpling or spicy chicken spring roll to start?  \"Tough decision, but I'd go with the spicy chicken spring roll.\"  Naked chicken breast or pork chop?  \"You can get the chicken anytime, but the pork chop is only on the menu today.\" Flounder or salmon?  \"Flounder's the daily special!\"   The fella took her suggestion on his side - the goat cheese mac and cheese - and I tried to be healthy and go with the cauliflower (if I knew more fancy food words, I'd explain how delicious this was). I wound up eating most of both. Nom nom nom.  Fork! is definitely worth a trip to Cornelius!"}
{"text":"This place rule!!! Super great food for a fair price. Amazing atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Quiet restaurant great for date night, healthy food and good drinks. It's good to make a reservation cause they fill up. Great service also!"}
{"text":"FORK! has it all! The food is innovative, and utilizes fresh local ingredients. The staff is knowledgeable and attentive. The decor and ambiance is funky, fun and sophisticated. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone, makes a great fun date spot and I cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for dinner last night! Very nice atmosphere!  It was quaint!  We tarted with an appetizer, smoked porked stuffed dumplings....wow.... amazing!  The flavor of these little things was incredible! I ordered a steak dish and Parmesan fries for my entree and both were excellent!  My husband had the braised shirt rib with goat cheese Mac and cheese!  The short rib melted in your mouth!    Overall it was a really nice dinner and we will definitely return!  I would highly recommend!   Oh and the service was great too!  Our waitress was on point !"}
{"text":"Loved our dinner for 12 women who delight in good food.  The chef & owner came out to our table and we applauded! Chef makes the pasta from scratch, bakes the desserts himself, sand even churns his own ice cream.  (I had the cinnamon ice cream which was perfect.). One dinner companion ordered a vegetable plate which was not on the menu but it was breathtakingly gorgeous and delicious.  We all tried everything and there were no imperfect dishes.  Go.  Eat."}
{"text":"It's honestly probably as good as it gets in Cornelius.  When they say 'farm to table' they literally mean it... there is a garden in the back with some of the herbs and greens they serve at he restaurant. The restaurant is situated in a house, so the tables are separated by rooms which makes it very intimate. The service was good and our server was knowledgeable.   The food, they have a few staples that are in the menu permanently, but the majority of the dishes change frequently due to what's in season or what the chef is able to get for the day. I had a soft shell crab which was very good. Next time (and there will be a next time) the lamb shank looked very good as well. The best part of the meal were the fresh sides: turnips, kale, corn, radishes... all perfectly cooked and seasoned.   Everything is made in house... I had a salted lemon ice cream that was out of this world. It wasn't for everyone, but it was definitely innovative and fun.   If it wasn't so far from Charlotte, I would definitely go more often. However, it's definitely a place you need to try if you have never been, and go again, and again. The food is better and at times less pretentious that most of their Charlotte counterparts."}
{"text":"Fork! was the perfecting setting for our monthly Girls Night gathering. The house in Cornelius was quaint and I loved the decor. They use the online reservation system Resy, which was easy to use. Our party had 9 people and they sat us in the back of the restaurant in a private room which was fantastic. Service was excellent and prompt, even with a large group.  For me, the best part of Fork! was the bartender and the Tequila Honeysuckle cocktail I had before dinner. I don't know if tequila will ever be the same for me! All of the syrups and mixes are hand crafted and the quality was impeccable. I had a sip of a featured summer spritzer and a basil-tini and they were both perfect as well. Fork! could change their name to Glass!   My meal was good, but lacked \"something\". The portions are small which is not a bad thing, but if you have an S.O. that likes to \"go big or go home\" this won't be their favorite spot. All of the food was incredibly fresh, but for me a little over-seasoned. My carrots and mushroom side were too salty and heavily oiled for my personal preference. The pan seared flounder was very tasty, but the butternut \"sauce\" I paired it with was much different from what I anticipated. The fish had cubed pickled butternut squash pieces finely diced on top of it. I appreciate the unique approach and creativity, but it just wasn't my favorite. For dessert I tried the Pumpkin Pie Cake. (I'm a pumpkin enthusiast and couldn't resist.) The filling on top of the yellow cake \"crust\" was delicious, but it left me craving more of the traditional pumpkin pie. Again, A+ for creativity, but not something I'd probably go for again. I need more help ordering next time!  In short, great service, GREAT drinks, interesting menu. I would try again without a doubt with another Girls Night Out."}
{"text":"Went to dinner with Robert and Kelly. Yum. We had bites and meals to share. Best brown butter pan seared scallops. Lobster Mac and cheese to die for. Tomato soup with falafel what can I say. Curled up on a cold day would have made it perfect. Also had lamb and beef and I had the best Bloody Mary in my life.   What a memory. If I had a diary I would write in it!!!  This is a wonderful place."}
{"text":"Not quite what we were expecting. The ambience is nice, the service is really good, the menu features local and in season meals/ingredients which is great. They source the beef from one of my favorite farms in the area - Mills Family Farms.  The dishes were decent sized and priced as any other fine dining restaurants in the area. Nothing absurdly expensive but priced right. The wine list is really interesting and the server was great in suggesting the pairings. She allowed us to taste several ones and the tastes were very generous portions.  The food was very well presented but the temperature was not right. I have to say that this was probably the only restaurant I have ordered a Hanger Steak that hasn't burned it. You order one at BLT Steak in uptown and it is burnt and extremely seasoned. The Hanger Steak here at fork has flavor and it is perfectly cooked.  The duck was good as well but again the temperature was a big disappointment. The side risotto was just okay, we were expecting a lot more.  All in all it is a okay place, for this price I would go somewhere else. If you are spending over $100 in a dinner you expect high standards. We got great dishes but temperature was a big turn off."}
{"text":"Great service. Enjoyed the cocktail menu and wine selections. The \"bites\" are my faves-- especially, the beet salad and the pork dumplings. I recommend Fork as a date spot or a cute spot to meet up with a lady friend. Felt like I was in Charleston for a minute!"}
{"text":"Had a quick, light dinner here tonight. Wonderful wine list, reasonably priced. I ordered two of their \"bites\" items, which are tapas in size. I had the meatballs and the salad with blueberries, strawberries, walnuts, and goat cheese. Both were spectacular. Even with a glass of wine, the bill was only $22.  I would go back here in a heartbeat. It's definitely a gem."}
{"text":"I have been hoping that this location would become a farm to table for a while - so happy someone finally did it!  Arrived around 430. We had our pick of seating outside. Everything appeared to be clean and tidy. The staff were very friendly but the greeting and seating situation was a little disorganized - too many people involved.   The menu was a little confusing in that you have to choose which sauce you want with your meat (also made me twitch a bit because it was reminiscent of the ordering at this location when it was meatballs on main -- rest assured, this was the only a remote similarity). I wish they had more descriptions about their dishes -- its hard to soak in a description from the server and really decide. We started with a gnocchi appetizer, eggplant/tomato/mozzarella appetizer and spring rolls. They were all quality. Would probably get spring rolls again. The eggplant had a pretty presentation, a bit heavy on the EVOO a bit of balsamic would have been nice.  We ordered two entrees, flounder and beef tenderloin medallions. The flounder had a good taste, slightly dry but didn't make the dish bad. The tenderloin had a fig sauce, it was robust but not too sweet. For sides, risotto and mashed potatoes, they were both good. I wasn't crazy how they served them in separate bowls from the entree (too many plates on the table).  For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding. It was flavorful and had a wonderfully fluffy, yet dense texture -- and not too sweet. We also ordered coffee and they were right on it -- wasn't a situation like, \"it's early\" or \"we just opened last week and we aren't setup for that\" or something --- it was seamless.  We were also happy to see a couple of our favorite farms on the list.  I am very tired of eating factory food when we go out to eat. It's great to have a fresh, laid back option when I don't feel like cooking!  Happy y'all are here :-) we will be back."}
{"text":"We arrived 10 minutes early for our 1:00 PM Sunday Brunch reservation. What a lovely former Main Street home. Our hostess took us into a room with about five tables, all occupied, one with a very loud baby in a high chair. I motioned that the noise level was unacceptable & we went back to the hostess stand. She mumbled something about not having another table (3-4 open in two adjacent rooms) & then took us to a lovely back room with adults having Sunday afternoon conversations? The afternoon deteriorated rapidly after that. The tomato & mozzarella salad lacked the necessary dressing to highlight the heirlooms, perhaps a balsamic glaze & my cheddar biscuit was a spotted yellow hockey puck.(this happens when the delicate dough is overworked) My wife's Belgium waffle w/fried chicken was extremely dry. A very small crucible of additional maple syrup couldn't save this dish. The addition of whole grain mustard to the Hollandaise Sauce overwhelmed my Benedict. Service was typical of a poorly trained staff. Coffee service was sparse & explained away by saying that they serve over 15 pots at brunch. I asked a bus girl for coffee, she left the room & came back minutes later to tell me she had told our server that we needed coffee? Our used plates were on our table until the requested check arrived. This lack of unity comes when staff is not properly trained to function as a unit. Be careful if you leave by the back entrance, the wood ramp has deteriorated & left some nasty wood slivers that could catch your shoes."}
{"text":"I really want to like this restaurant, I really do. Last nights experience downgraded my rating from my previous post. Dinner started to go downhill when our server was explaining that the Scottish Salmon was wild caught and another server interrupted her and said that  it wasn't and they literally had an argument right in front of our table. Very uncomfortable. Our appetizers and drinks were served and enjoyed. Then, we waited almost an hour for our food. We would have waited longer, but we finally found the manager and he stated that the printer malfunctioned and the kitchen never got our order. Our food came out in sections, my side first, nice and hot, then my monk fish, cold. We never really received an apology, but a 10% discount showed up on each of our bills. I gave three stars because the food was great, so they have a great chef, but service needs a face lift."}
{"text":"Make sure if you're going for brunch here to get a reservation. We did not and had quite a wait which was by no means the restaurant's fault. It was just super busy! I had the eggs benedict with crab and prosciutto and it was amazing. This wasn't even the wonderful mimosas talking."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch while visiting friends in the area. Let me start by saying that they don't do bottomless brunches which is why I took a star away. The food was fantastic and it was a very neat setup as it was once an old residential house now turned cozy restaurant."}
{"text":"Had my first meal at Fork a couple of Saturdays ago and it was a great experience. It had snowed a couple of inches the day before and the staff had completely cleared the parking lot, sidewalks and steps of all the snow / ice. I loved the building, a former residence I think, that houses the restaurant - lots of character and charm. Because I was alone, I sat at the bar. My server was extremely knowledgeable and very helpful in guiding me through the menu. I started things off with the Southern Fried NC Oysters in creole tartar sauce; they were magnificent! I then ordered the Blue Crab & Mascarpone Ravioli and a side of Collard Greens & Potato Hash. Both were excellent! Dessert was a Gingerbread / Pumpkin flavored ice cream which was a great way to end to the meal. It may have been my first time at Fork but it won't be my last. Great job, Chef Groody!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place!!  Went for the first time yesterday for Mother's Day Brunch and was very underwhelmed.  Our service was super slow, drinks took forever to come out and came about the same time our food was served.  We had 6 people in our group and 5 were served together and one meal came out about 8 minutes later.  The French Toast was really dry and when we asked for more syrup, we were given about 1 Tbsp more.  The strawberries were sliced as opposed to macerated.  I ordered the fried eggs benedict and I wasn't a fan.  The goat cheese really overpowered the rest of the flavors and my egg was undercooked.  Once I saw raw egg white, I was done.  The hashbrown potatoes were good.  I was really hoping for a better experience for our Mother's Day brunch (there were 4 Mom's celebrating in our group).  I'd like to give Fork! another try - hopefully I'll be able to update my review with better results."}
{"text":"Such a quaint place. A beautifully restored home is a perfect setting to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. I had read all of the rave reviews for this place and I've been meaning to get here for some time now. Here are the positives: beautiful setting, outstanding customer service, delicious food. Negatives: parking is limited, tables are too close together (so don't expect to have intimate conversation); everything is a la carte - so it can be expensive in the end.   Our server, Brandon (or Brenden?) was attentive and charming. He's the only person we interacted with.   I ordered the braised lamb shank. It fell off the bone. It was delicious. I also ordered the pork dumplings and the goat Mac and Cheese. They were just ok to me. The Mac and Cheese was bland and I don't understand all of the raves about the pork dumplings - they were just ok.   I would definitely like to return in order to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I love their farm to table rustic vibe and I love that each day we have fresh selections to choose from. Everything I've tried has been delicious. My favs are the lobster mac, naked chicken and pork chops."}
{"text":"My 4th visit to Fork and never disappointed. They consistently serve fabulous food, great service all in a cozy atmosphere.   Tonight we had a beet salad, risotto, sword fish with lemon, basil and horse radish saice. Fresh, flavorful and fabulous!   Hands down my favorite in Davidson, Cornelius and Mooresville area!"}
{"text":"we were there for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed it.  My wife and I went in opposite food directions - she with fish, and I with the brisket.  We shared a watermelon and heirloom tomato appetizer.  All were very fresh, well prepared, and very well presented.  Waiter was very friendly and informative.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about fork, so we decided to make the drive (~35 minutes) to try it out for dinner one Saturday night. Overall, the food was good, but the service was horrible.   We arrived for our reservation and were quickly seated, but then sat for about 10 minute before anyone came over. We ordered 2 glasses of prosecco and an appetizer. Again, waited a long time for both, and the appetizer actually got to us before the prosecco did--waited another 5-8 minutes before these drinks arrived. We then ordered a bottle of wine and our main dishes. Another long wait--and again, the entrees arrived before they ever brought over the wine! At this point it was a waste to get an entire bottle of wine, so we cancelled it. Would have gotten dessert, but just couldn't sit around and wait any longer.  Overall, it was disappointing. The waitress did apologize saying they had a new bartender. But they should have made appropriate adjustments. The manager never stopped over despite the lackluster service. And the restaurant wasn't even packed, there were plenty of open tables. Sad to say that we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great grouper and duck breast.  Risotto was creamy and accented with veggies full of flavor.  Patio a little noisy.  Well renovated interior.    Nice stopping place on return to charlotte from wineries."}
{"text":"Great food!! We had the crispy duck wings as an appetizer. They were delicious & crispy. I'm very picky when it comes to duck. They did a very nice job. Fat was rendered out & skin was crispy.  We also had the lamb shank & Wahoo. Lamb had lots of flavor & falling off the bone. The Wahoo was perfectly cooked; the red & green sorrel sauce was fantastic. The parmesan fries were to die for!!  We were also very happy with the bacon braised greens & cheesy grits. Everything we ate was phenomenal! Drinks were good. Atmosphere was pleasant. Our wait person, Brandon, was very attentive, nice, & helpful.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Four of us went for brunch and there was a 30 minute wait for a table although there were several empty tables for two next to each other. The waitresses were all busy scurrying hither and wherever. We were finally seated and ordered the crab hush puppies as an appetizer. Glad we did because they took forever to come out and our food took two or more forevers. When it finally arrived it was cool if not cold. The chicken and waffles were inedible. The waffles were cardboard and the chicken must have been reheated because it was dry. The smoked salmon was edible but almost nonexistent. My wife searched for the crab in the crab Benedict and my biscuits and gravy was cold and lacked flavor, not even hot sauce revived them. I have a feeling we will not be back."}
{"text":"First time, date night.  No reservations so we sat in the bar area, which is small and super cute.  Brandy the bartender was our server.  Perfectionist at her special concoctions.  My husband said that it was the best Manhattan he had ever had. The special made Jalapeñ-Yo Business was spicy  goodness. She was a busy lady, yet super sweet & attentive as she could be. It was actually a lot of fun to sit by the bar and watch her make the drinks.  Food  Truffle oil deviled eggs, interesting and savory  Lamb shank, tender  Roasted Cailiflower was a small portion but very good flavor Calamari, salty but tender smaller potion for $10 Veggie risotto , good but could have used goat or parm. Cheese  We would definitely come back and try this Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"BRUNCH wins the show at FORK!  We love dinner too, but we LOVE LOVE LOVE brunch.  They change up the menu every so often, adding new items to love.  My absolute favorite is their ham & pesto benedict (which isn't on the menu anymore, ***bring it back!!). Hubs loves the prosciutto & crab benedict.  Their french toast is pretty amazing with the perfect balance of bread, marscapone & berries.  Lovely beverages too.  Dinner is a very different experience but one that is enjoyable with friends or an intimate date night out."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed the food and service was very pleasant however, the drinks were too small at a high price. Don't mind spending, but expect a generous pour for higher prices."}
{"text":"Great food. Farm to table. Classy assortment in a healthy, organic style. Our server Dotty was the best!"}
{"text":"We went for Father's Day brunch and I wasn't sure what to expect. I had made a reservation in advance since we had a large party. My original reservation was for 6 although we needed to add another spot. The hostess, who called to confirm, assured me it would be no problem to add another chair to the head of the table.   Upon arriving, it wasn't very crowded at all and we were promptly seated. The service was good but not extraordinary. The food was very good. I was, however, disappointed that our food didn't come to the table at the same time. There was a pretty substantial delay between meals being delivered. My son was almost finished eating by the time my food came.   Overall I would definitely return to give it another try."}
{"text":"We came for brunch because our neighbors raved about their meal.  Unfortunately the food was average and the service was poor. I have worked in restaurants and there was no excuse.  We waited 30 minutes for a table.  When we arrived,  there were 4 open tables.  (They do not take reservations unless your party is more than 8 people.). While we waited,  tables opened up and would stay open at least 7-10 minutes.  I asked where we were in the queue after waiting more than the forecasted 20 minutes, and the hostess said we were next.  There were 4 open tables at that moment for parties 4 or fewer.  It took another 10 minutes to be seated. Admittedly, the hostess' attitude and performance set the tone for the meal - an unfortunate but realistic consequence for the kitchen and wait staff.  Our food ranged from good (chicken waffle sandwich) to mediocre ( biscuits and gravy that was lukewarm) to below average (shrimp and fork linguine).  The shrimp and fork linguine included over cooked Bokchoy that had a furry texture.  No worries, the portion was so small it probably was not enough to make one sick.    We will not get back the 1 hr 45 minutes devoted to this experience nor will we return. I have never posted a bad review, but this experience should not be overlooked."}
{"text":"I've visited Fork a handful of times and have always had a very consistent experience... it is just okay.  I have attended a few times for lunch and, honestly, couldn't tell you what I ate.  It was fine but left me a little disappointed. Although, I did have the bread pudding they had at the time and it was amazing.  Went for brunch, hoping for a better experience and was still just okay.  My wife got the chicken/waffle sandwich.  The chicken was good but the waffle wasn't flavorful.  I ate the prosciutto and crab benedict.  Small plate and, again, really not much flavor on the plate.  I have had a few dishes from their catered menu recently as well that tasted better than the regular menu items.  Fork gets decent reviews in the area so I would suggest anyone test it out for themselves."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a Great dinner here!! Pork dumplings and truffle Mac were delicious!! Lamb shank special was very good too. Prices were very fair and portions sizes ample. We enjoyed the service and atmosphere as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah so the food is good. But my husband and I spent $80 total on food and we were still hungry when we left. Incredibly small portions and heavily priced. We went once and we will never be back."}
{"text":"I have visited every restaurant in this location in the last four years, and Fork is inarguably the best.  The food is upscale - carefully prepared and made with the expertise of a chef who knows what he is doing.    We sat on the porch and while we didn't enjoy the pop music they had playing somewhat loudly, we enjoyed just about everything else.  You will have to resign yourself to paying separately for your sides.  That makes their prices a bit on the high end if you like to have a side with your entree, but the food is really good.    I do wish they had offered bread to start, as most restaurants of this caliber do.  My hubby started with the feta salad, served warm with olive oil, olives, and toast.  He enjoyed it very much.    I had the scallops for my entree.  Here's what is interesting about their menu - the meat dishes come prepared at the chef's selection, but the seafood dishes come with several sauce options.  I chose the basil, butter, and shallot preparation, which was really good with the scallops.  I also had the kale/bean side, which was a reasonable $3.50 and had incredible flavor.  My hubby had the lamb, served with an olive tepanade.  He said it was the BEST lamb he has ever had.  Boneless, the lamb was perfectly medium rare, and had a ton of flavor.  His spinach side was a bit of a smaller portion than mine, and wasn't as tasty.  Service is upscale and matches the quality of the food.  Our server was knowledgable about the menu and attentive.    We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious from the sweet tea to the truffle Mac. Parm fries are a must. The staff was very kind! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"For is SO for me. Pricey but I'm ok with that as the fresh food and the farm to table concept is delicious!! The cocktail list a mix of good and bad for my liking but they also have the standard beer and wines to satisfy everyone.  Really loving this place for brunch too! Careful with appetizers though!!- many of them are too small to really even get a taste!"}
{"text":"Large group after graduation for Sunday Brunch. Tried several of small bites, all good, spring rolls were popular, crispy, perfectly fried with wasabi and plum sauce. Arugula salad with bamboo and other crisp additives was excellent as was kale salad. FORK serves 200 folks for Sunday brunch. Restaurant is housed in Victorian era home with same kitchen size house was built with. Well worth trying..."}
{"text":"Awesome setting in this nubby little restaurant. It's in a small house- very relaxed atmosphere. Food was great- service was superb."}
{"text":"Really solid farm to table options - the specials menu featured a lot of fresh options. Everything was tasty and well portioned. Nothing changed my world, and the truffle mac and cheese was a bit bland. However, the ambiance was lovely, the plates were yummy and the service was very good."}
{"text":"We used to visit this location frequently when it was a tea house and are glad to have another great restaurant in one of our old haunts.  We were skeptical to try \"Fork\" due to trying several failed attempts by other restaurants at the same location.  However an acquaintance of ours, who had worked with the chef previously, raved about the chef's food and recommended we try it.  We were unable to book a table Friday or Saturday (hope that is a good sign) so we visited on a Sunday afternoon.  They were only offering brunch but there was still a good selection and the food was delicious!  The decor was nice and more of a modern feel (compared to the old tea house).  We can't wait to try the lunch and dinner menus.    We will definitely be back!  P.S.  The only downside to our experience was that we were in the small front room with only one other table of what appeared to be what we like to call \"Lake Chicks\".  They were so loud that we had to pause to talk between their cackling and loud talking/laughing.  Not really the restaurant's fault, but it would be nice to find a way to help with the acoustics in the room to help quiet it down a bit."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and amazing. The portions are not huge, but who wants to be that full when they leave. Good selection of food and wine. I need to try there brunch but so far only a couple of dinners. Could not fine one thing wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Fresh food, great flavor, excellent service! Would definitely go back again! Loved the lobster mac and cheese."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and had great dinner and drinks. Thoroughly enjoyed lamb shank and deviled eggs.  Also recommend cauliflower and risotto. Will definitely be back.  We paid $100 for 2 drinks each and 1 entree plus 4 a la carte sides."}
{"text":"Upscale menu in relaxed atmosphere.  Ala carte. Excellent drink menu.  I enjoyed the duck and risotto of the day (bacon, red onion and goat cheese).    Portions are not huge for those of you who like to EAT but I left comfortable.   They were packed on a Saturday night at 7.    Wait staff knew their stuff."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the area and we were looking for a good place to have brunch on a Sunday afternoon. We decided to try this place bc it was in a cute Victorian style home and looked like a nice restaurant. We were not disappointed! The restaurant is adorable inside and out-they did a great job restoring this old home. Our food was phenomenal. I had the herb cheddar biscuits and gravy and my husband had the French toast. They were both to die for...best French toast we have ever eaten! I would highly recommend this place for brunch and I look forward to trying it for dinner"}
{"text":"We tried Fork! last night for the first time and it was absolutely delicious - definitely worth the drive from Charlotte. Great drinks, great service, unbelievably good food - and it's in a cute old house.  Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"New to the area of Cornelius/Davidson I had not yet tried Fork for brunch but had heard great things! My boyfriend and I stopped in around 11:30 on Sunday and the small but cozy restored house had all of its' tables filled. We were lucky enough to be able to grab a high top within the bar area.  We started with the Spicy Chicken Spring Rolls served with both a Wasabi and a Plum sauce. True to their name this was a small plate and was a perfect bite-sized appetizer for two. Moving on to the main course I had a Prosciutto and Crab Benedict with a Whole Grain Mustard Hollandaise. I was pleasantly surprised by the hollandaise sauce as it was not very potent with mustard flavor and acted as a wonderful contrast to the salty flavors of the prosciutto. I would definitely get this dish again and would recommend to others! My boyfriend was also pleased with his selection the Cheddar Herb Biscuits and Gravy. Stealing a bite as I always do I loved the herbacious flavors of sage in the turkey sausage. Overall we were pleased with our experience and will definitely be back to try their dinner!"}
{"text":"Another farm to table restaurant which I love! The food selection is limited but fresh. The drink speciality and dessert menu are delicious. The lobster mac is to die for!!! Outdoor seating and dog friendly is a plus. The staffs and manager is always friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is I absolutely love this place.  They have turned an old home into a restaurant.  I love sitting out on the porch.  The drinks are totally creative and the food is just excellently cooked every time."}
{"text":"Very fun place to have a meal.  I went for their Sunday brunch and it did not disappoint in any aspect.  A best atmosphere where you feel like you are eating in a house with clean and unique decor.  Best of all and most important, the taste of the food absolutely crushes it.  Their biscuits were some of the best I have ever tasted.  My meal was a blue crab and mustard hollandaise with a poached egg over a toasted English muffin. Felt like I was eating food straight from a fine dining magazine, and the prices were very affordable (about $10-13 for most meals on the brunch menu).  I will definitely be back for more in the near future.  One last thing, another nice bonus is that they use a lot of locally sourced ingredients which really gives you a genuine taste of the charlotte area."}
{"text":"Oh it was very good. Loved everything I tried. Now I was a bit put off by the Maitre d . He kept staring at us the entire meal. There has to be a better option than just having him standing there all night long. Most restaurants put up a sign that says wait to be seated and you wait until someone arrives. I just though it odd having him watch me through the entire meal. It started to be a game to see if I could catch him, and I did every time. My other suggestion would be to maybe change the light bulb in the room with the bottle light. Its was just way to bright for the type of food being served.  you want a warm experience when you are spending all that money. Now the food. Very good, I had the scallops. Wished I was given a few small sauce bowels but I enjoyed the one I tried very much. The mac and cheese was great and we had the beets salad . We also had the collard greens which were very good. My daughter had the chicken and loved it. We also had the salmon and my other daughter said it was very good. So over all it was a hit. I would just put a little more effort into atmosphere and you have it made.I understand they are looking for a mod experience but the flood light during dinner could be lowered, maybe even a dimmer for dinner. But food wise I thought it was great. I also enjoyed the wine from Abruzzo."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend for a GNO.  Finally, a menu that might make it past a couple of years.  They use as many local ingredients as possible.  We had our waitress talk us through the menu.  She had so many favorites we actually had to make some serious choices.  All the food was delicious.  Also, I love how they opened the front bar area.  The facility is still a cozy house but now it has more flow.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Fork! Sitting out on the front porch enjoying a meal made of fresh, local ingredients. The farm to table movement has become quite cliche. However, this restaurant fulfills the promise of the premise. A salad of fresh greens and cucumber and cherry tomatoes was simple but pleasing. I liked the cherry tomatoes because they were a variety of colors and ripeness and this gave more distinction to the flavor. My wife had a cauliflower Swiss chard soup the was nothing short of phenomenal. For the entree, there were a variety of specials for the night. The fish was tilefish from North Carolina, not to be confused with the pervasive tilapia, this is a grouper like fish. My wife ordered it and there was a choice of four sauces, and she got a sample of all four. None were too rich or buttery which is often found with sauces for fish in nice restaurants. These sauces were flavorful and not fatty. I liked a jasmine chili sauce. There was even one with tiny butter beans. Needless to say, the fish was great. I had a steak dish and it seems that you can taste the difference in the flavor of the locally raised antibiotic free beef. The lobster Mac and cheese was better than the run of the mill version of this dish often found and was laden with lobster. The"}
{"text":"I heard their brunch was poppin'! However, I'd have to say you can't go wrong with their dinner either. Everything is farm fresh, they use herb from the garden in the back.    I had a view of the Chefs kitchen from my table and I could see the passion in each prepared dish. I love that the daily special varies so you may not have the same thing twice unless it's on their main menu.   For our entrees, we tried the Soft Crab, Walu, and Scallops. I can't tell you which we loved most because we enjoyed them all! We were eating on one another's plates by the end of dinner.   For a party of 5, our total was approx. $150-189. The quality and bill aligned appropriately.  Perfect place for an intimate setting. You're inside a cute quaint Craftsman home. Parking is tight around back. I'd recommend parking next door if you're arriving for dinner or Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Fork. Used the app to make reservations and communicate we were going to be late due to traffic. Food was fabulous! Only issue was the room we were in. There was a very loud group that over powered the room. Our waiter had to pretty much yell. Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"5 open tables. Hostess wouldn't seat us without reservation. Showed available on OpenTable 30minutes later. I won't stop by here again out of principal. I'll go give North Harbor my money for brunch. This isn't NYC."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Fork 3-4 times per month. Most of the time, it's on a weekend night. We love the concept of farm to table, and Fork always has a fresh menu with different options. We use the Resy app to be able to reserve a table in advance, which we love the convenience.  There are a few staples that we always enjoy (naked Chicken Breast, Hangar Steak, etc), but we really enjoy trying the fresh seafood and fresh vegetables. The wait staff is very friendly, and always takes care of us. Sometimes the kitchen can be a little slower than we would like, but that's what you get for having the ambiance of this great small restaurant with the small kitchen.  Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very \"southern\" nice atmosphere, great food and professional staff. Great place to take the family for brunch."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last Friday w/another couple and I was very underwhelmed.  We were seated approx. 7:30 and didn't eat our entree til after 9pm.  The rest to me is almost irrelevant.  No one explained to us what the holdup was.  And yes, I know the kitchen is small, however, that does not excuse the fact that we were never given any updates/explanations. And it wasn't very busy to boot. After I finally spoke up, someone, who may or may not have been the manager but am not sure, offered to pick up our dessert.  By that time we were tired and annoyed and didn't want to be there anymore so we didn't even take them up on it.  It may have been an off night but there are many other places in and around the area that I want to try before thinking of going back.  Hits:  Location,  parking   Misses: $$$ appetizers for what you get (i.e. $6 for 2 spring rolls) $10 mixed drinks.    Table in middle of large room with open views of kitchen/bathroom line.   Service."}
{"text":"Great old house with some well prepared dishes. The lamb shank was excellent. Seemed very similar to lamb shanks supplied to other restaurants I've eaten at around US - did not strike me as very \"farm to table\" but I could be wrong there. Billed as a \"farm-to-table\" place yet the menu was not as 'local' of a personality as I'd hoped.   Farm raised Atlantic Salmon from \"off the coast\" and Scottish salmon were a huge bit of a reach also.   The risotto wasn't as deep and slow/Long cooked as authentic Italian risottos are, but heck! most restaurants cheat on their risotto here in the US. Good quality rice, a bit too al dente gave away the shortcut. But it was kind of bland. I dumped my lamb shank sauce in it to jazz it up.   The greens, mushrooms and 'trail mix' dish was too salty. Way! I still feel the salt as I write this, despite drinking two pints of water.   The evening was nice. The patio is great.   A friend of mine from Sant Barbara CA recommended this place and I had higher hopes."}
{"text":"Definitely the best restaurant in the Lake Norman area, and maybe in the Charlotte metro (no lie!).  Fork has respect for food, and does a masterful job of building menus and recipes that highlight top notch, local, seasonal ingredients without overpowering them.  No tricks here . . . when the chef came to our table at the end of our meal and I raved about the sauteed baby carrots (that's right . . . I raved about carrots!), he said the only secret was that the carrots we ate that night were in the ground that same morning.  My vendors from New York, Chicago and Boston who I've dined with there all have asked when we can go back.  This place is for real!"}
{"text":"Thank you Fork! This past Friday night, I had one of the best meals I've had in the QC. Every bite was absolutely perfect. From appetizer to entree, the balance of flavors, quality of ingredients and care with which each dish was composed shined through.   We ordered from both the standard menu and the daily specials page starting with a cheese plate and smoked trout ravioli while our entrees were NC Wahoo and CAB tenderloin medallions. On the side, lobster mac n cheese and roasted cauliflower. I won't go into the details on each, just reread the first paragraph.   Service was friendly and efficient and I'll end as I began. Thank you Fork!"}
