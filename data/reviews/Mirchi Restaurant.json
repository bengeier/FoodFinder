{"text":"Have to say: this is the BEST most authentic Indian food I've ever had! Both in Toronto and Calgary! I ordered mixed vegetable curry to go. Decent price."}
{"text":"Reading some of the other reviews, I assumed I was going to walk into a hole in the wall....maybe this speaks of my standards, but I though that although simple and small, Mirchi is pretty  clean and decently decorated.  The place was pretty busy when we got there, but we were given a seat promptly and some menus and water right away.  I cant believe how cheap Mirchi is...My friend ordered the Chicken Biryani..only $8 that day and the portion was huge. I stole a couple bites..it had big chunks of chicken and was spicy as hell! Im not complaining, but Im a wimp when it comes to spice. I ordered the Butter Chicken. It was rich and creamy. It wasnt overly tomato-y which I like. Ive had some BC that taste like theyve dumped a can of Campbell's in the mix..disgusting. A smaller portion was served, but still filling...and spicy! I didnt expect it to be, but it was..so a warning for those who are wimps like me. The naan was the most perfect bread I have ever tasted. Light and crispy, with lots of garlic. I would go back just to order those alone. Next time, Ill order in and use yogurt to cool the flavours down for my \"delicate\" palate."}
{"text":"Went in for late lunch and was so pleased I ordered a more to take home for dinner.  Butter chicken was the best I've had in ages, garlic naan was large and delicious. The rice was cooked perfect.  The portions were very generous and if I lived here I'd eat it every week.  Would have been 5 stars if the waiter would have came back just a bit sooner to check on me and offer my bill but not a big deal."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's happened to this place but it has really gone down hill. This has been our once a month takeout place for the past 4 years and I have always loved it but the past several times have really let me down. Tonight we decided to give them one last try......disappointed. My go to Veg curry that was always great was a greasy bowl of mushed veg. I could only identify the carrots which was probably the only fresh veg added to a curry that had been cooked to death. I'm so disappointed!!  Now we have to find a new Pakistani take out place :("}
{"text":"One of the best in the city. Been coming here for years for my Indian fix. The Butter chicken and garlic Naan always hits the spot."}
{"text":"There meatball curry was undercooked and you could see the pink ground beef inside and the spices was over the roof I wished I had a bucket of water beside me instead of a glass of water.  Their restaurant is most filthy place you can ever see I believe their Naan oven hasn't been cleaned in ages as you can see even dirty oil dripping from their cooking area  .  Highly recommend to people who want to get sick.  I wouldn't be surprised if one of these days they get reviewed by health Canada."}
{"text":"We we dined in have had take out. Stay away from the biryani, we've always been dissapointed. It's not to Pakistani standard, rice is not basmati rice (the ideal rice for biryani), its very stale, has a strange smell and clearly heavily microwaved. The kebabs are made fresh and taste good, but are a bit overpriced at $10 for 2 pieces. The kofta are also quite good. Generally it is better to stick to the grilled items."}
{"text":"I found you! this is the first Pakistani restaurant I've been to in Calgary and just the look and smell of the food brought back all my memories of when I ate many of these dishes on a daily basis when I use to live in Dubai. This isn't heartburn I'm feeling, it's love. I love Pakistani food and I've fallen for Mirchi! haha  Chicken Karahi - this bone in curry chicken dish is spicy, tangy and served with slivers of ginger on top and is really delicious   Kababs - these are probably the best Kababs I've had in Calgary ever  We came here on Wednesday night and learned they only serve up the REALLY good stuff on certain days. For instance, their Biriyani is only available Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Their Nihari is only available on Saturday... so guess where I'm having dinner next Saturday?! Hell yeah baby! Mirchi.  Oother good things about this place is they have vegetarian options, h Include the herbed yogurt side for those who can't handle the spice or love it anyway like me and a traditional cucumber, lettuce(?) and onion side with your meal - its a plus x 2 because you don't have to ask for it, they just give it to you like traditional Pakistani restaurant s I've been a regular of :)  Salam Alaikum"}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all costs!. Not worth your time, money or toilet paper!. I got extremely sick from the uncooked food. about $15 for 5pieces of chicken in the butterchicken & about a litre of sauce. they also always close weirdest times... 1 day they are open the next they aren't... then next close early then closed again! Impossible to keep up with schedule. So if you live far from this place MAKE SURE TO CALL AHEAD TO SEE IF THEY ARE OPEN.... even if it's peak time where everywhere is open without a doubt... still call because it's a 90% chance they closed."}
{"text":"Went to dine in with my wife on 8/30/17. We told the cashier we will take a seat so that we can look at the menu and decide the items to order. My husband went to the counter to place the order. They told us they will come to our table to take the order. When they came to take the order they said sorry this table is reserved for someone. They wasted our time and money. We took a uber to go to their restaurant. Really disappointed with their service. If a seat is reserved put a reserved sign on the table, don't waste people's time and money!!"}
{"text":"Neat little spot with very limited seating. I had a combo plate with a cauliflower curry and butter chicken. It came with rice. My friend had a combo with two vegetarian dishes and ordered an extra order of naan. Everything was tasty. It's not a fancy place and it is kind of a take out counter with added table service kind of place. It seemed to have a steady stream of regulars too.   The only thing that put me off a but was the washroom. While the decor was nice, it's smell was off putting and it wasn't very clean. But everything else was good thoguh so they get 4 stars from me."}
{"text":"Really good pakistani food. Great ambiance. Reasonable prices. Hospitable staff. And meat is fully halal. Will definitely be there again."}
{"text":"We arrived in Calgary around dinner time, checked Yelp, and were delighted to see an Indian restaurant with fabulous reviews near our hotel. Yelp, you didn't let me down. The vegetarian combo was outstanding! The dal was fresh and gingery, and the mixed vegetable curry was one of the finest I've had in Alberta. We also had the prawn tikka which was very good as well. Portions were very generous, leaving us with lunch for the next day. Naan and rice were included, which made this take-out meal(s) a real bargain for under $30. If we lived in Calgary, I imagine we'd stop by Mirchi often. I suspect we will likely visit again on future trips south."}
{"text":"awesome food!, very affordable!, I absolutely love the butter chicken here!. I can see why they have won multiple food awards. great vibe, friendly staff!. very small with only 4 tables and 4 seats per table eating in is sometimes difficult because it's always busy! which is a good thing people line up to eat here. my fav take out is.... Butter Chicken, Beef Tikka & 2 garlic nombread YOU CANT GO WRONG!. price to food ratio is second to non! will fill you up and leave you with left overs for another great meal. (reheated MIRCHI'S food is just as good as it is coming off the grille). I'm just rambling and talking away here.... I make a 20min drive from the south east just to eat here... I've never had a bad experience eating at mirchis i don't understand the negative reviews people have given this place. i am 100% certain that mirchis is EASILY the best indian restraunt in Calgary. if people don't agree Id love to hear where a better place is to eat indian food.  mirchis DO NOT CHANGE A THING YOU ARE DOING EVERYTHING GREAT!!!. keep up the good work!."}
{"text":"We ended up here after heading to Sahara (which used to be in this space) only to find it was closed and Mirchi was now the restaurant. Had a fantastic meal, the goat was amazing and the butter chicken I keep dreaming about. Service was slow and needs sone work, but the kitchen is pumping out some of the best in Calgary."}
{"text":"A staple of Calgary's Pakistani restaurant scene. For a long time, this was the go-to place for authentic Pakistani bbq and curries. Their service has improved and the food is still excellent. I would recommend the lamb chops and any of the karahi."}
{"text":"Good food, very friendly owners, small little place that obviously caters more to take out. I found it a little overprices compared to other comparable Pakistani or Indian restaurants, but it's probably because of the location. The butter chicken and beef dish Pakistani style were great. Did not like the garlic naan we were offered, I prefer the simple one and assumed it would come with the food, since we never requested garlic naan. We got complimentary pakoras that were succulent."}
{"text":"Amazing seekh kababs! Probably the best in Calgary (hint: don't get the spicy seekh kabab unless you have an infinite amount of time for a session at the nearest washroom if you know what I mean)"}
{"text":"Mirchi is one of the few restaurants in the city offering Pakistani Cuisine. The BBQ section is an area of strength. This restaurant is primarily set for takeout, and has just three tables for those wanting to dine in."}
{"text":"Good flavours but meat was overcooked. I will come back hoping that the next visit will be better"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.  I wouldn't lick the floor, but I'll eat the food.  Thumbs up for good kababs!"}
{"text":"The chicken biryani was very dry. I saw the cook microwave the biryani before packing it up for me. When asked if it was microwaved, they claimed that it was prepared fresh on that morning. The chicken was very dry and didn't seem like it was made fresh. A restaurant serving yesterday's microwaved food is just pathetic. This restaurant used to be good."}
{"text":"Superb food for someone like me not accustomed to this type of food. I enjoyed the chicken karahi and butter chicken (I love chicken in general). The service was good and price good for portion size and freshness. Haven't eaten authentic Pakistani food, I recommend this place if your new to it.  It's worth trying, just don't bring a large crowd due to seating."}
{"text":"Amazing Butter Chicken and spicy vegetable curry really hit the spot! garlic naan very garlicly !"}
{"text":"This is one Restaurant that we liked every single dish that we ordered... Goat chops are great and bbq platter is also awesome...."}
{"text":"this is worst restaurant in canada, i ordered lamb karahi and it was full of oil, tasteless and very expensive and very less quantity, and then rotis are very hard to eat, even animals can't eat this food, i wish there was minus rating for this, i recommend don't visit this restaurant, they don't have seating capacity and looting all customers with high prices"}
{"text":"Great food and service, always!  Just wish they would change up the menu, its been the same for ages."}
{"text":"I read a lot of great reviews here but am sad to say that my whole order was terrible. Maybe don't do take out? The butter chicken had like 5 pieces of actual chicken in it. The Pakora was so over cooked it was like chewing leather. We threw it out. The samosas are tiny and bland. The servings were very small compared to other Indian restaurants I've ordered from for around the same price. Oh and I found a weird hard thing in my rice. Would not order from here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and service here. They are very nice and accomodative to client needs and I say this because as much as I love indian food , I am sensitive to spice. Food is always fresh , accurately spiced and very reasonably priced. By far the best Indian food place in terms of great taste and service. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"The butter chicken is absolutely amazing as was the Afghan chicken. Rice was average. Garlic naan was okay. I really can't say anything else to be honest but character limit needs more. I really can't say anything else to be honest but character limit needs more."}
{"text":"New to reviews, i thought i should start with my favorites, Mirchi has been my favorite pakistani restaurant for almost 10 years, there have been times where the food was not consistent but always delicious. The menu has been the same with only minor changes over the decade, everything on the menu is amazing, the Goat Karahi, The mirchi kabob, and the biryani amongst my favs, the naan is amazing. A staple in Indain/pakistani food."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place. This is kind-of one of those places that you would call a \"hole-in-the-wall\" except that it's not. It is small but the decor is very pleasant. Now to the best part - the food. Excellent. Delicious. Wonderful. Naan's are great. Butter chicken is super. Hot chai is perfect."}
{"text":"Best Indian I've had in a long time.    Get there early they \"run out\"  of the good stuff.  PEople in and out non stop.  This place is happening on the Calgary food scene! Delicious!"}
{"text":"The best Pakistani restaurant hands down in Calgary, it's a small mainly takeout, but seating is available for small groups, or just a solo session, the menu has been the same since they opened with minor price changes, holds the best value for a combo. You have a choice of a couple meat curries and a couple veggie curries daily served with the best Naan bread or Rice. The Tikkas are amazing, flame grilled while you watch or wait,  also they make chicken  Biriyani fresh daily, I am a pioneer here, I have been eating here since the first day they opened. A Must if you haven't tried. I noticed a few reviews on service, well, the food is amazing, the washroom is clean, the service is based as a small takeout or a quick sit down, not a full service restaurant so go enjoy the best Pakistani food in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. I must say the food is very tasty but super oily! I ordered the vege combo which comes with a choice of 2 veges plus rice OR naan. The choices were daal, aloo bengan, and mixed veges. The daal and aloo bengan were excellent...except for the oil! The non-veg options were haleem and butter chicken. My friend had the butter chicken and said it was very good. The naan was simply amazing...made fresh in the tandoor. The food came with raita and salad. I was bummed that they didn't have gulab jamun since I'd read good reviews on it. I paid $15 for my vege lunch combo which I think is pretty reasonable for being in downtown Calgary."}
{"text":"Mirchi is awesome. Prices are reasonable. Usually I order takeout but the one time I dined in the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"I have been to this place only once and decided never to come back. I judged not only on my experience but also based on the quality of food. My experience was very bad. I'm not in a bad mood when I entered the restaurant. I went there for a a take out. Restaurant was clean. When I was placing my order the lady who takes my order was laughing at me when I was inquiring about the menu dishes. Kitchen is visible at the reception where we place our orders. All the staff were standing and eating in front of the customers without even due respect. I know that may restaurants reheat the food but its so rude that these people do it in front of you and that too with the hands, without even washing there hands. Cook was eating at the time I placed my order. After I placed my order he placed his bowl aside and started to reheat my order. He didn't even wash his hands and he was still chewing.   I can understand it might be his dinner time but he could have come out of the kitchen to dinning area to have his dinner. Eating and chewing food while preparing food is not at all acceptable. I think most people come here just because food is inexpensive compared to the other restaurants. But I don't mind paying few extra bucks for handling my food with care.   Even after this experience I was with an open mind while tasting. It wasn't that great. It tasted stale, so I didn't eat it.   I would say please don't take customers for granted. You are not giving your food and service for free. We are paying you."}
{"text":"We stopped in here just after getting into town. We were hungry, and it was convenient. We were impressed by the quality and quantity of food for the money. The flatbread and kebabs were excellent, and the staff was prompt and solicitous, despite a small language barrier. I suspect that we were the only native English speakers in the place, other customers included, which I consider a very good sign."}
{"text":"On the weeklong trip to Calgary, this was my first stop for a lunch. Mirchi is a small casual dining restaurant in the downtown Calgary. It does not have its own parking but there is some parking close by on the street. Good things first, for a small place it is neat with nice decor. The service is fast, and the presentation great. Menu has a variety to chose from. I decided to try out goat karahi. I confess that it was a tricky dish to chose from because barring a handful almost all places in North America fail at it. And the it failed the authenticity test. Goat in Indian/Pakistani cuisine should not have that peculiar aroma that you commonly find in Mediterranean lamb or goat dishes. That said the garlic naan was really good so was the dessert, kheer. I will see if i decide to come back on this trip to try some other stuff and update the review."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the two most authentic Pakistani / East Indian Restaurants in Calgary. Their Boti's are to die for and they make a fabulous Nihari.  If you are looking for real Brown Man's food this is it.  Oh No now I'm feeling like making a trip down there."}
{"text":"I have been dreaming about Mirchi's gulab jamon for a month now, so when my honey suggested we go have lunch I automatically chirped \"Mirchi Please! Mirchi Please\".  Today was an extra ordinary day and I have to update my review because I am still seeing stars in my eyes.  We shared the delicious chicken curry and a vegetable with spinach dish at 6.00 dollars each, we also ordered basmati rice which came in a huge bowl and naan on the side (again a very big portion).     All in all including pop and gulab jamon for dessert it came to just below $22!  This was a huge meal for the amount of money we spent, and we didn't even finish the chicken curry.  Yelpers I insist that if you want a delicious mouth watering Indian meal for fewer than 8 dollars come here! Every item is savoury and superb, and the owner is so delightful and so gracious.  It is such a nice relaxed place to eat an extremely authentic Indian meal."}
{"text":"The food here is outrageous in the best of ways! Like its not even funny how good it is, I've yet to have something I didn't like."}
{"text":"This is a very small restaurant in downtown. It has great veggie options, I don't eat meat so I like their veggie choices, especially the dal (lentil) curry and their featured curries are so so good, they change daily. I like the cauliflower potato and eggplant potato curry. Naans are fresh, and fluffy. Also offer good combos for 2."}
{"text":"Mirchi has been consistent over the years, great food, and a fabulous value for money proposition. My usual suspects are Dhal, Afghani Chicken, Beryani, Samosas, .. which are just a cover for really good rice and Naan."}
{"text":"Randomly landed here twice through yelp while on travel and enjoyed a quick nice meal...  A whole in the wall place that's clean and offers good service. The afghan tikka on a snowy in Calgary night was too good and so was the Wednesday special  Haleem. I am coming back here for sure. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Mirchi is so tasty! I could not stop myself from shoveling food into my mouth like an animal it was so delicious.   It is also very reasonably priced, so be careful not to over-order! As noted in other reviews, two people can easily share a combo, with a couple of extras if you are really hungry.   They have a couple of tables there, so you can dine in as well as do take-out. I think the delicious smell of all the food is worth staying there to eat it. Do yourself a favor and try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump with slimy bowls of thin curry. I have never been here when the food wasn't 8 hours old, took forever to heat up, and didn't have enormous spots of grease floating in it. Awful place. Not even inexpensive. Learn how to cook your own curry or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst place, I took a take out today and they gave me left over biryani from other customers It had half eaten bone and a left over mango pickle piece in biryani. I had to throw the full box. Never go to this place"}
{"text":"Yo Yelper's I present to you...  The Lazy Girl's Guide to Dinner  1. Call Mirchi, order combo meal (I highly recommend butter chicken and veg curry - $15) 2. Add side of naan ($1.50) 3. Open wine, allow it to breathe...ok ok..have pre-dinner drink 4. Put on coat, walk 1.5 blocks 5. Pick up food, rejoice at price/food ratio 6. Walk home, pour second glass of wine 7. Discover salad packed in order, price/food ratio even more favorable 8. Eat amazing dinner 9. Marvel at amount of leftovers, future self rejoices upcoming delicious meals! 10. Finish bottle of wine   Boo-ya!!!"}
{"text":"I work on 11th Ave and needed something quick, so I ran over to Mirchi. I wanted the vegetable curry but all that was left was the Daal. I came in right before 10pm after my shift so that's to be expected. I was Leary as iv never tried it before but he suggested I give it a go. I ended up getting the Daal with Rice and Naan.... Omg it was so good. Thanks for helping me venture out from my usual. It was delicious. The staff was extra friendly as well... Also sorry for coming in right before close. Much love."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, definitely must go place in Calgary."}
{"text":"They rip you off when hey run the credit card.  They charged me 20% more than what they should have. It was later when I saw the rates card that I realized how they ripped me off.  Naan and curry was okay... I wont even give 3/10 for the food quality.  Do not recommend. Waste of time and not trustworthy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few people from work. The food is a nice portion and quite tasty! The servers were attentive and quick to bring us additional items. Only complaint is that the rice was not that great and butter chicken was too spicy!"}
