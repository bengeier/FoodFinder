{"text":"This is one of the best AYCE sushi bars! I love almost everything they have on their menu! Their salmon is always fresh and their seaweed is not chewy! I recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"This is one of the better AYCE places in GTA.  Location is convenient, plenty of parking.  The servers are quite responsive.  We started the AYCE at 8:30 and didn't feel rushed.

I like the sashimi - they have beef sashimi too!  Hot food I like the golden shrimp, calamari, squid balls, beef short ribs.  They have a few favors for ice cream, it is worth nothing that the ice cream is not hard and frozen like in some AYCE restaurants.  They take individual orders for ice cream so you can have multiple scoops for single / multi favors in one bowl.  

I am not a big fan of AYCE anymore but if someone wants to go, I will suggest Ichimoto."}
{"text":"this place is quite horrible.

Food: nasty uneven cuts of sashimi.  maki looks like they were rolled by a retarded child.  remember, everything tastes good when you're starving.  i'd approach this place only after going on hunger strike for minimum 5 business days.

Services: typical rude chinese service giving you attitude and a look of disbelief that you can eat all that you order.  Also, not all items you ordered shall arrive.  Be ready to re-order food, receive things you did not order, and when you're damn full and regretting your decision to come here or for even considering AYCE (again), guess what? rude lady server will show up with shit you ordered 50 minutes ago. Enjoy!

Atmosphere: noisy.  you will be able to eavesdrop on conversations of the 4 tables around you. 

Really, I don't even expect too much when it comes to AYCE sushi.  Everyone knows it's going to be subpar and expects to pay atleast $25.  But it is the lack of dignity and respect and effort with which the chefs put into the dishes.  It is like they're feeding a pack of hungry wild boars. wild boars that pay cash.  I can hear sushi gods weeping"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food here is always great and I swear I've been here at least ten times. I love their hand roll and I definitely recommend the barbecue eel.

I've never been here for AYCE, but i probably should considering how much I eat each time. The portions are small, allowing you to regulate what you eat which is actually pretty useful. 

Personally, I'm a big fan of California rolls,  and theirs aren't the best but certainly not too shabby.

Overall? Great food and great service to top it off, definitely coming back even more."}
{"text":"Fresh food. Good service. Includes soft drinks and desserts. My fave is the hand rolls and grilled fish head. Most of the cooked items r done well. Sashimi is fresh. Price very reasonable. I would recommend reservations as the place is not that big."}
{"text":"I love love love this restaurant! 
I come here 5 time already and have the V.I.P card. 
Its soo great, the waiters are really nice and attentive 
My favourite is the sushi pizza! so good OMG"}
{"text":"Best sushi AYCE!  great selection of food and good quality.  Spicy scallop sashimi is my fav!"}
{"text":"First and last!
My husband and I ordered both all you can eat and A la Carte at the dinner time. Greasy deep fried and the size of sashimi and sushi were pitty. We could have much better quality of food for the cost of $68.00 before taxes!
We rather go to Sushi on 7 next time when craving AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Ordered several items and
They were never served.  Service was slow.  Food was ok nothing great.  Will not
Be back"}
{"text":"Was craving AYCE sushi, and this place totally satisfied us.

They have lots of cooked food options also, beef sashimi, grilled beef, deep fried oysters.  

They have All You Can Eat or A La Carte menu.   We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 5 times now and I have yet to think of a complaint other than when it's busy things come a bit slower but then again all restaurants have the exact same issue.

My husband and I are originally from Toronto but now live in Seattle, WA. We go back to Toronto to visit family and friends, and usually do a group gathering at Ichimoto, this time I made a reservation for 9 people. Most of us got there on time but 2 of them showed up 1.5 hours later which is when they should have kicked us out. The restaurant was very busy yet the owner was so nice not to kick us out after 1.5 hours. Since 2 of our friends showed up late they gave us extra time and we spend 3 hours there in total.

The scallop sashimi is always so delicious there and is definitely one of my favs. I also highly recommend the beef sashimi, soft shell crab roll, salmon sashimi, and mango tapioca dessert. When coming in a large group they will usually offer a sashimi platter to start, I personally find that very proactive. 

This place also has a 10$ off VIP card, and is definitely worth your money. They take credit card if you pay full price but cash only if you use your VIP card. 

Every time I'm in town that's where you can find me at least once per trip."}
{"text":"This place is good for a couple reasons, you can choose whether to have all you can eat or order individual dishes.  If you choose to order yourself, its pretty cheap.  food is so so, no complaints.  Service is pretty friendly.  Reason its not five stars is because portions are too small."}
{"text":"Just mediocre. We went here for lunch when we got there, there were 2 other tables being served. There was one server and what seemed to be the owner. We placed in an order and the server came around to say it is last call! So we put in another order. Tge sushi wasn't great, it was alright. Completely meh! I foundcthe sweet potato shrimp to be super greasy but cool looking. While we were eating the table beside us got filled, apparently the owner knew these 2 women and service was and attention was diverted only on to them and their conversation seemed quite intense. Now we ALWAYS tip, but I guess some don't as this establishment believes everyone regardless of how many ppl there are should be charged a 10% service charge. Even if the service is lacking."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good food and friendly staff... until they asked us to leave (nicely) after being there for 2 hours! LOL  We didn't mind anyway because it was getting a little busy and they were very friendly throughout the experience.

The portions are very small in comparison to other AYCE restaurants I've been in the area.  That could really go either way.  Because the portions are small, I found the rolls perfect and not stuffed with rice!  The grilled beef is also tasty BUT small!  The golden prawns are delicious! A must! :)"}
{"text":"I went there with some friends. It's a nice little place. It's good for big and small groups. Lots of food. Very friendly people. I like their variety. Bigger than in the most of the other sushi places.  One of my fav tempura shrimp and avocado sushi."}
{"text":"I love this place as you can choose to have AYCE or individual orders.  This is good for people that are cravng for sushi but don't want to stuff themself.  Someone that just want a light snack.  The individual pricing is very competitive as well.  Like $1.50 for most items so you can go crazy and order 4-5 items and you will be good."}
{"text":"As far as AYCE sushi goes, this place is definitely one of my favourites. My boyfriend and I are avid AYCE sushi eaters (we're hungry people, ok?), but we still care about the quality of the food at these places.

And this place is awesome. We're never disappointed with the sashimi, and the fact that they offer spicy scallop sashimi too? Ding ding ding! Love it. They do a great job with the beef sashimi too, though I wish the slices could be a little thicker...

Food always comes fast and I love how the staff are very friendly here. If there's a tip I could give to every restaurant, it'd be that a smile goes a long way!

If you're looking for an AYCE sushi joint with a good variety of food and at great quality, look no further. Always feel like I get my money's worth when I eat here!"}
{"text":"mediocre selection of  types of sushi/sashimi. Lots of hand rolls but basic in contents. For  the money there is better . good service,clean place ."}
{"text":"Place is too large and with size comes lower quality of service and food. Don't be fooled by the free lobster offer."}
{"text":"Not too shabby for an AYCE. 
Food was good and service was friendly and quick. 

We were able to make a reservation for a large party on Sunday and the place is small, so basically we took up the entire place. 

$21.99 + tax for the weekend dinner, $19.99 on any other dinner day. They dont charge you extra for speciality items, but there is a caveat at the bottom of the menu (if you eat mostly sashimi they charge you more)....

The menu system is easy, where you write in the quantity you want in the little check box. Tons of choices, but remember, this isn't Izakaya (omg, how awesome if someone made an AYCE night at an izakaya), the menu items were pretty basic japanese food. 

The sashimi was pretty good and tasted like something you'd get a place on Bloor (which is quite alright to me!). 
My favourite was the grilled salmon head (bc I love fish head). Get this, if you're also a lover of fihsh head. it was fried, but not so much that all the good stuff was dried out. Very soft and slurpy like it should be. 
The pork with enoki mushrooms were a bit tough. 
The short ribs were think, not marinated enough and not cooked for long enough.  That was disappointing. 
The veggie yakiudon was very tasty. 
Their rolls were also quite good. I love that I can order soft shelled crab with out worrying about the extra cost. 
For dessert they have tons of flavours of ice cream. There is also fried banana which you can combine (see the deep fried section). 
They also have mango tapioca pearl dessert soup (decidedly chinese, but still yummy). 

Overall I'd give the food a 3.5. Not my first pick for a meal, and I wouldn't go out of my way, but I would gladly come here if suggested. 

Chinese run, the ladies do a better job if they speak cantonese than english, but were very nice. near the end of the night, I was surprised they didn't kick us out, and gladly took a group shot for us."}
{"text":"This is a great place for AYCE sushi. 

There are several places I enjoy going to for AYCE sushi around where I live, although this is a bit further from my house, me and my boyfriend keep returning back because of their scallop sashimi. I've tried many AYCE places in the GTA area, and this restaurant is probably amongst the very few that have scallop sashimi in their AYCE menu. Before the Japan earthquake earlier this year, their scallop sashimi was actually imported from Japan. Not sure where their scallop sashimi is from now, but it's still very good!

Me and my boyfriend always arrive with the intention of trying their a la carte menu, but we always end up having AYCE because of the scallop sashimi.

Everything else is good too, but I wouldn't say as much variety as Tenichi. Warm food is also good, I really like their chicken wings and gyoza. Golden shrimp is also very good. 

Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this ayce restaurant. The first time I came with a big group so that's why I thought the service was not all there. This time we were a party of 4 and I thought service would be a lot better. It was not the best as they forgot some of our orders and we had to reorder. The food came a little slow in the beginning and we didn't get our soup and salad until round 2. 
The food itself was good, sashimi was fresh and the cooked items were made well. I wished they had the red snapper sashimi since most other ayce places have it. This place has scallop sashimi though which is a thumbs up. 
Ichimoto is a busy restaurant, which I have to say is a good sign for freshness and good food. The only thing that really needs improvement is service and service consistency.

Hope to be back again!"}
{"text":"I don't think Ichimoto deserves the high reviews it gets. First of all, the choice isn't THAT great. There aren't enough meat/seafood dishes. Second, the service wasn't great - any sushi place that tells me \"there is no way you can eat this much\" is automatically 2 stars down in my books. Don't tell me what I can and can't eat!! YOU DUN KNO MEH! But seriously, you're running an AYCE joint - get over yourself. If I don't finish - you charge me. How is this not a win-win situation...?

The food quality was good, the sashimi was GREAT actually, specially while tuna.

The shrimp tornado rolls were WAY too big and they were coated in deep fried sweet potato string-thingies. Mmmm not really a fan of the sweet potato in this case. 

The galbi was OK, still worse than Hockey sushi. Actually, off topic, but the best galbi I've had so far was at the Newmarket Mandarin. 

The sushi were NOTHING special, all tasted the same. 

I'm disappointed, I expected more after reading the reviews."}

Comments
- this is one of the better AYCE Japanese food in Richmond Hill / Markham area.  
- if you're planning to visit on the weekends, call ahead to get reservation because this place gets quite packed by 6.
- there is quite a bit of variety on their AYCE menu,
- beef tataki and raw scallops are on the dinner menu, something you don't often see on AYCE menu uptown."}
{"text":"Food: Always come here for AYCE. Spicy scallop sashimi is the best!!!! Maki are good too. Only complaint is that icetea tastes weird.

Services: generally good services. but one time we ordered a dish and it never came, we thought they've missed it and kept ordering and later on found out that they just ignored an order just because they didn't have it anymore, without telling us...

Environment and decor: average

Price: relatively cheaper compare to other AYCE."}
{"text":"This place serves suchi like dim sum....little portions just enough to satisfy, but not too big so you can't try a tonne of stuff.

They do have a buffet option...and I would suggest that if you're even slightly a big eater...just go for the buffet because you'll find yourself ordering lots, and it'll just cost you more.  One of the first times we went, the 4 of us ate $100 by going a la carte, then we realized if we just did the buffet option, it would have been $60 (tax + tip included).

So...the next time we went, we did buffet and ate like it was going out of style!  The jumbo golden shrimp are fantastic!  A must try!  They are giant, and wrapped in sweet potatoe, then fried.  The fried oysters are also good, but the best is the Beef Sashimi!!!  All this for $11.99 at lunch on weekdays.

We've also tried the lunch specials.  The bento boxes are $7.99 and you get a decent amount.  Of course...if you're a buffet person, you'd eat at least 2 of those, if not more.

In the last 4 months, we've been there at least 8 times.  The kids love it and it's cheap for them because I can get them a small beef udon noodle soup for $2!!!  I order a couple of califonia rolls for them and each kid costs me less than $5 to feed.  Not bad for a japanese kids meal.

Is it the best sushi I've had....no.  But does it have good variety for a decent price - Yes!  As mentioned before, the beef sashimi is something unique, along with the oysters and jumbo fried shrimp....those alone are worth going to try!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Portions small, service uneven, items checked off on the AYCE menu were not delivered, coca-cola was flat and the \"white tuna\"  (whatever the stuff is) was not fresh.

Good grilled squid, though."}
{"text":"I always come here to order A la carte. Between a family of 3 that doesn't eat too much, we tend to pick the more expensive and elusive sashimi options. Uni, amaebi, scallop, raw beef, and other basic choices like salmon or masago are ordered every time. We also get some basics like fried rice with unagi, grilled eggplant and tempura and we actually do get full. It often comes to ~45-50. BUT! After going a couple times, the head waitress recognizes us and we have a VIP card. We get 10% off when she sees us there and complimentary mango pudding and miso soup. If we went for AYCE, it would cost at least 65 but the a la carte menu has always been the better option for us. Been going for years, and that will stay the same. Make sure to make a reservation for weekends!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Veggie Bento Box $5.99 for lunch. The waitress also gave us a small dish of cucumbers as appetizer. 
-the mitso soup was as expected. 
- didn't like the salad that much. perhaps too much vinegar? 
- spicy rolls were awesome though! too bad there are only three. 
- tempura veggies were good! I tried it w/ soy sauce instead of the usual tempura sauce (since they forgot to include it w/ my box) but that was nice.
- salad roll (which is really cucumber rolls) was just ok. 

the place was clean though & service was ok. waitress was friendly but not genuine imho.."}
{"text":"I would say this is one of the better all you can eat sushi restaurants. I was quite pleased with the overall experience. 

Most of their menu offerings were on par with standard, like their maki, grilled eggplant, and sushi. What we loved were their tempuras! The breading was quite amazing, crispy and flavorful. The shrimp was fresh and sweet, the vegetable (mostly sweet potato, I believe) were big and tender. We just couldn't stop ordering it.

The service was superb the day we went. Maybe because it wasn't extremely busy. The waiter came by often to clear away dishes and refill tea, and the food came fairly fast, which we appreciated because we were hungry!

If you are craving japanese food and is looking for an AYCE that offers quality dishes that leave you wanting seconds (in which case you just go for it and order again, a great feeling), then give this a try. You may not be awed or wowed, but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"Very nice and affordable all you can eat sushi. They have some signature dishes that my Asian friends really liked. I thought they were okay too. 

Be careful I you go when it is quite, you will get more than you can eat ;)"}
{"text":"I went to visit Ichimoto again to try out their al carte order. This time I ordered the Salmon Hand Roll ($2), Eel with Rice ($1.5) and  stired fried bittemelon with egg ($2) and free miso soup.

I am again disappointed with the Hand Roll... The Salmon is so small but there is a lot of rice.

The eel with rice and the bittermelon though are quite good! The portion is just perfect for eating alone!

Bill comes to $5.60. Ha ha I cannot argue that is a really good price to treat that as an afternoon snacks!

As usual the waitress is really nice! Now second time I visit we are on first name bases.. :)"}
{"text":"I'd be generous if I gave Ichimoto 3/5 stars...so 2.5/5 it shall be.

The first time I was here it was for a birthday so service was inconsistent. I decided not to write a review just because we had a large group. Yesterday a group of 4 of us decided to try out Ichimoto since we were in the area. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away.

Service was pretty inconsistent throughout our stay. More than half of our orders were missing so the lady told us to re-order our missing items. Before we were about to hand in our sheet our missing orders started to show up so we had to be careful not to order twice. Our appetizers didn't appear until round two which is weird because those are the most simple items to prepare.

The food items were pretty good. The maki rolls didn't fall apart and the sashimi was fresh. Oh I forgot! There was hair in one of the maki rolls...NASTY!

Overall, it's an okay ayce sushi place. If Ichimoto can improve on their service then they would get a higher rating."}
