It's One of my favorite spots from now on !!"}
{"text":"One of the best place in town. Everything is so fresh and their service is always very fast. They have Korean style sashimi set menu. That's what I had at the first time. Hand roll was really good!! Also liked drinks. This place look so cooooool and they have karaoke!!! I haven't tried other menus but I'm pretty sure their foods are very good and you will like it!! Best place in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I was at Fish In The Spotlight for their grand opening, and they have some of the most delicious sushi and sashimi in Las Vegas. Their severs and staffs were really friendly and helpful. My date and I ended up getting the sashimi platter and the white tuna carpaccio. The white tuna carpaccio is so good that it became my favorite dish there. In addition, we had the halibut from the sashimi platter and it was so fresh and delicious that we ended up ordering more. We were so full from the sashimi that we didn't order any dessert. Overall, Fish In the Spotlight is one of my favorite place in Las Vegas to have a la carte sushi. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fresh and delicious sushi. :)"}
{"text":"You must check this place!
This is icecream beer I had. The icy form was so good. And you should try lychee soju and grapefruit beer too. It was awesome. I love this place !!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service. What else can you expect when you go out and spend your money. The sushi special with the Miso soup.....Hmmmmm. The seafood soup..,,deliciousssss. Excelent experience. I really recomend this place."}
{"text":"Best restaurant experience I have had in ages. LOVE THIS PLACE! 

The atmosphere was great and the staff was amazing. While my friends and I caught up after a long day of work, our food was brought to us in a timely manner and our drinks were kept full.  I have to say though, the sweet shrimp was AMAZING! 

Definitely returning on an off day to enjoy the excellent food and trying one of the drinks this time! Saw an interesting one with cotton candy in it. Hmm."}
{"text":"I had great experience for dinner!
So good food, drinks and service! What else do we need? I think I'm going to be royal customer!"}
{"text":"Awesome place, brand new and beautiful. Awesome menu, good prices and super nice staff. Definitely looks like the new hot spot for karaoke. And they have Guinness on tap! Huge sushi portions as well. Definitely check them out ASAP."}
{"text":"Sushi, karaoke, beer pong & and ice cream topped beer. Interesting concept, delicious fish. Eel, ikura, uni, and albacore were outstanding. They'll even do name-your-budget omakase. Worth the trip off the strip. Friday and Saturday from 9-10pm open bar with free beer and cocktails with $5 purchase."}
{"text":"Wa had a great dinner.
Had a Halibut Course Special for 2-3 people. ($90)
Quality of the sashimi was very fresh and came with lots of side dishes.
Good service, reasonable price and the great taste will keep me going back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, good service and nice atmosphere. Fish in the spotlight uses TJ karaoke system. Also their audio system is I'd say better than other karaoke places in Las Vegas. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"Wow the food is good. Great service as well. Best place in Las Vegas to hang out with friends on a late Saturday night. I'm glad I checked it out. I'll be coming by more often."}
{"text":"Visited the place based on a friend recommendation, we really enjoyed the food, the ambience, the service was AMAZING by Akiko who was our server and also Jake, we'll be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi with fantastic service. Great quality fishes with a surprising smaller check. The Miso soup and the fries! Super kid friendly, just so attentive, really great spot."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with lily! She my favorite bartender... Makes the best drinks in Vegas! Great place... Great food... Amazing atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Sushi + karaoke + underwater decor = what's not to love?!
In addition to private karaoke studios, raised booths, light-up tables, and the sushi bar are all available, and there's also a beer pong area if you're into that sort of thing. Menu has a variety of raw items, cooked items, and a $45 omakase option.
 
ICE CREAM BEER: No, it's not a beer float, more like a Sapporo beer slushie. The beer foam is frozen on top of a large glass. Fun and refreshing, even if you're not usually a beer fan. 
GARLIC POTATOES: A little underwhelmed, but well-executed. Seemed to be missing the garlic sauce, just topped with some chopped herbs. Simple, crispy.
CRAB JALAPENO POPPERS: Tasty! It's a slightly-healthier version of your favorite bar snack. Not spicy, for all you wimps out there.
SASHIMI PLATTER: $18 plate of 8 types of sashimi, with marinated beef and chopped fish, served with miso soup and rice. Filling portion for one or easily shared and split with a roll, like we did. Fresh, flavorful, and good variety. I especially liked the salmon belly, black pepper seared tuna, and the hamachi wrapped with red onion.
BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM ROLL: I gotta love a place with fun names for their rolls! 5 types of fish with eel and ponzu sauce. Despite the abundance of ingredients, flavor seemed to be missing something. Would try more rolls here, though.
SUZUYA GREEN TEA CAKE: All desserts are fresh daily from Suzuya, and the green tea cake is definitely one of their best offerings. Got ours comped to go, which was a nice treat!

In addition to the fresh fish and flavors, I really dig the ambiance and service: management, bar staff, and servers all made a point of interacting with us and being on top of dish recommendations. All dishes are plated beautifully, too. Glad we live close by, would love to see them add more special rolls to the menu."}
{"text":"Place is overrated and pricy. It's more of a bar/place to hang out than restaurant. Aside from the ambiance and albacore carpaccio, the food isn't great. The ice cream beer, which sounded enticing at the time, is just frozen foam over your choice of beer at $8 per glass. Oh, and at the end of the night the waiter, albeit he was polite, swiped my credit card 3x and claimed it didn't work. Lo and behold, the next morning my bank account showed 2 large transactions from this place. Thanks, FISH in the SPOTLIGHT."}
{"text":"This is one of the best place to try a fresh sushi + Halibut sashimi. We were a party of 3 and small size of Halibut Sashimi was blasting. Be prepare to eat a lot since there is LOTS of side dishes following with the Halibut Sashimi. The best part was Spicy Fish Soup with Soju :)

An owner of restaurant is so kind and even gave us piece of Tiramisu as a comp (Tiramisu from Suzuya).

If you wanna enjoy fresh sushi and Sashimi, this is the place to go. You won't be disappointing!!"}
{"text":"I was invited at this restaurant by Scott and was more than happy to accept an invite to a sushi restaurant, especially somewhere new.

So this place is a few months old, open from 6-10? We arrived at 6 and we were lucky enough to have our own sushi chef at it disposal. 

This is the majority of what we ordered:

Red snapper 4/5 
Onagi 5/5
Fatty tuna 5/5
White tuna 4/5
Salmon 4/5
Step and repeat  5/5
Bend it like Beckham 5/5
Tatum 3/5
Flying fiber 5/5
Baked muscles 5/5

The 4/5s didn't taste as fresh or soft as they should be. It was a little rough around the edges but still very delicious. Tatum was definitely or last favorite. 

Our server and service was awesome. 

We were told that the sushi list was kept at a total minimum for a good reason... To avoid having the same exact ingredients just in a different order, which I totally get. Kind of like going to taco bell. You're essentially eating the same thing just made a little different. 

With that being said, here's why its not a 5/5.

-I wish the list was just a little bit longer.
-service was perfect but... I can't give it a fair score when the place was really slow.
-there were a lot of items being changed, or items they didn't have. They're new so I get it but if you don't have it you should take it off or keep a note of it so the customer can see it.

Leaving it on a good note, this place looks like great, food was great, service was great, back lit menus are awesome, good music, private karaoke rooms... Etc. 

Definitely coming back and hoping to change this review to a 5/5."}
{"text":"Love the ambience. Love the food. Love the staff. Perfect place to unwind after work. The only bad thing (if there is) is the location.  Once you get inside though, the place looks great. Definitely looking forward to go back."}
{"text":"They just opened last week and the quality of the sushi and sashimi was amazing! Compared to the other sushi restaurants, \"fish in the spotlight\" is a package of fresh sushi and Korean tapas with DJ playing every weekend with private Karaoke rooms and lounge service packed with a full bar. What more can you ask for?! Definitely will be coming back for date night and party!!!"}
{"text":"Fish in the Spotlight was a great spot to eat and the decor was really unique! The service was amazing. The server constantly made sure my friends and I had refills. The food tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"I first heard of Fish In The Spotlight after Cassandra B. invited me to her metal head meet up. Rounded up some of the boys and have pretty much been here every weekend since. Why? Well they have karaoke, good food, beer pong, and something called...wait for it...

UNLIMITED WELL DRINKS on Fridays and Saturdays nights from 9-10!! Well you first need to make a $5 minimum food purchase I believe which is nothing really lots of choices around that price. 

Pro tip: sit at the bar and drink as much as you can during that hour then do your singing after. More drinking. 

Ain't nothing better than drunken karaoke. Who know you might not even make it to the karaoke room and just start singing at the bar. Plus the staff is pretty chill and fun to talk to when they aint too busy. 

For drinks it seems like they'll pretty much make whatever you want as long as they have the ingredients and know how to make it. They already have nice list of drinks on their drink menu and on the yelp app. They have this drink where they top your beer with frozen beer, I must try. 

The food for most parts are really good. Let's see I've had the chicken katsu. It was aight. The chicken itself was good and crispy on the outside but the sauce served with it wasn't your usual katsu sauce which I would've preferred. I'd ask if they have regular katsu sauce when ordering. I've had the marinated beef it was a nice meal tasty marinated beef, tasty salad, and rice. I'd order that again. Bulgogi fries, jalapeño poppers, taco wasabi, and other items all delicious. Need to try more of their sushi and other items though.

And for you ladies, supposingly you need to check out the ladies room. I've heard there's some pictures you all drool over. Honestly just ask me and I'll make you drool too lol jk. Guys, all we have is a cute Asian girl on our door. Ladies, don't go wondering too far to the men's restroom somethings can't be unseen. You've been warned.

Anyways I'd be back. Can't go wrong with that drink deal, good food, and cool people here."}
{"text":"Our reservation for halibut dinner for 3 was made 2 weeks prior, and it started out as a dud as the ice cream beer machine wasn't working and then the waiter told us that they didn't have enough halibut for us. We were also the first one's there when we showed up at 6pm. He offered us a mixture of sashimi with the halibut dinner side dishes. He could see that we were ready to get up and leave because we were there for the halibut. The manager had great customer service and told us that he will make us the halibut dinner and also give us complimentary desert for our troubles. He also gave us a little trio of sashimi with the halibut to make us happy. Great customer service worked, and the manager really worked for his 5 star yelp review. 

Food was great, and customer service is even better. I will have to be back to try their ice cream beer. I'd probably call first to check."}
{"text":"The food, ambiance and the service is amazing.  The Ahi Poke salad is a must try.  Ask for Scott and he will steer you the right way.  This place is not to miss, great late night and lunch specials."}
{"text":"Fish In The Spotlight has fast become my regular watering hole. I visit at least once a week. There are so many things I like about FITS. In no particular order, here are the things that keep me coming back

FRESH FISH - I always start my evening with an order of salmon sashimi, hamachi sashimi, maguro sashimi, a spicy tuna roll, and 1 random item which I have not tried before. I can't express how fresh and tasty the fish is here. Fish is definitely in the spotlight!! Also feel free to try other treats such as bulgogi fries, tako wasabi, pork belly platter, daily specials, and the rest of their eclectic menu. 

THE BARTENDERS - Chuck and Cess are the dynamic duo behind the bar. As soon as you walk in, you're greeted with a huge hello which makes you feel instantly welcome. Both Chuck and Cess are very friendly and attentive to your needs. They will make sure your food and drink needs are fulfilled and always willing to help with any menu questions you might have. And be careful if you challenge Cess to a game of beer pong, she'll pretty much whoop your butt. 

Karaoke Rooms - There are several Karaoke rooms for rent. The rooms have plush and comfortable seating. You could totally fall asleep on them. 

PRO TIP - Don't be afraid to buy your bartender a drink. Chuck has trained Cess well in the ways of korean bartending. :)"}
{"text":"Sushi. Karaoke, luminescent underwater Art Decorum. Japanese & Korean Cuisine. 

Consider all the above elements to create the backdrop of a fun evening out with friends or family.

The atmosphere is friendly, the wait staff does an amazing job of bein personable and anticipating your needs. Each server where's a fun name tag that is electronic an scrolls their name.

Even the menu you will grab your attention, not with just the wonderful array of food offerings, but the pages light up when you open the menu book. Nice touch!

I definitely would recommend this place for  food, drinks and karaoke!

Maybe, I'll run into you here in evening :)

Have fun!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town.  Love the food and the staff! Everything was beautiful,  from the ocean mural to the  lighting and seating arrangements.  Definitely my go to sushi spot."}
{"text":"Fish in the Spotlight is an awesome place for the freshest and inivative sushi in town. They have a great selection of appetizers with generous portions. I had the mayo shrimp (deep fried with a honey mayo) was DELICIOUS!..The carpaccio was so fresh and expertly cut that it just about melted in my mouth. This is my favorite spot for some late night sushi, great drinks, and terrific food."}
{"text":"Okay. So i was skeptical about this place but its so yummy!!!! Everything i had was amazing!!! We had the boneless chicken the pork belly spicy seafood soup and srf & turf.... everything was ON POINT!!! I wasnt impressed with the nigiri but thats okay! Everything else was bomb. The service was amazing ;) i will def be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for their Grand Opening. Sushi and Sashimi are ultra fresh and delicious. Very good selection of cocktails and wine. 

If you are looking Nobu quality and atmosphere with out the Las Vegas strip prices, then head over to Fish in the Spotlight!"}
{"text":"Great experience for dinner!

This is a new hot spot that just opened a few months ago. They open for dinner and late night and have gr at food, drinks and karaoke for all those of you that wants to reenact your own episode of American Idol. 

The server Ryan was very nice and attentive, seated me right away at the sushi bar. I ordered one of the sushi rolls named after the all famous Channing Tatum and the beef Sukiyaki which is the beef bogolgi in a soup form with a raw egg in the middle. The role was really tasty and the rice was very soft and the fish was very fresh. The beef soup had a slight sweet taste to it but the broth was very tasty. The 2 sushi chefs that were working that night were both skilled, nice and friendly. 

After my meal I decided to take a quick trip to the ladies room and a bit to my surprise the walls were decorated with half naked pictures of Channing Tatum and David Beckham, only two of the sexiest man alive. I guess it's always nice to stare at hot man when you're sitting down to Pee. 

The tables in the restaurant I'll glow in the dark and changes color as well, the interior design was very well done, very posh, with a slight twist of sex appeal. Definitely a great place for karaoke in late night.

Plenty of parking and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decided to hit this place. It's in the same strip mall as NV Chicken Cafe. Parking lot is dark I don't know if the lights were broken or what. The place does not look appealing from the outside but when you go in its a total different story. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and led to our booth. Ordered crispy rice with spicy tuna they put sugar in the rice which I was not a fan of. The tuna sashimi was really good. The chicken dish was ok. Music was good and a fan of the TV's 

Overall a good experience would come back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on 11th during the promotion.

Cons
-In drink menu, only alcohol names were listed, I had to ask what sodas and juice they have.
-Since I was there first time, I looked at menu and did not quite understand, needs more clarification. But pictures are not needed.
-Even I'm very skinny, the sofa was very uncomfortable(too narrow), bigger people won't be able to sit for long time, and eat comfortably.
-Not enough chefs and waiters compared to size of the restaurant, wait time between meals was long(15-20 mins), even though I ordered them at once.
-Udon noodle was little overboiled. And egg should be served separately because some don't  like the smell of raw egg.

Pros
-Very kind waiters, they explained everything, they gave us good recommendation.
-Sushi platter and sashimi platter were good. (Main Focus)
-Service (promotion for customers)
-Menu with light
-Miso soup had good amout of tempura
-Surf-turf was amazing, sweet and spicy, but little too salty.

Other thoughts
-My father had sprite in his cup, but one waitress thought it was water, so she refilled the half-fulled cup of sprite with water. Well,  she apologized and gave him new one.
-I could not see the restaurant sign because it's placed at low position
-PIctures in restroom were irrelevent.
-Recommend to young people.,not for family with little kids.
-No wifi on purpose so customers would talk each other instead of loooking at their smartphone?"}
{"text":"New spot found by my friend and we love it! We have been there 3 times and no issues. Fresh seafood and great atmosphere. They have a karaoke room but haven't tried it yet. They have ice cream beer! The best! And my last fave part is the girls restroom with Channing Tatum & David Beckham pics. Staff were friendly and attentive. We will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"WHY NOT LOVE SUSHI AND DRINKS! Living in Vegas got me used to okay-quality of fish, but Spotlight definitely broke the ice for me. Perfect pair of fresh sashimi and drinks. I tried their icing-icecream beer, A MUST TRY. I dont think you can find this anywhere else in Vegas. Trust me. Try this place out, then you will know what I am talking about! Friendly staff and modern atmosphere is a ultra plus on top of live DJ playing requested songs. 

MUST TRY: Music&Lyrics, Icecream Beer, Prosecco (drinks)
                : Mr.Panda, Bend It Like Beckham, Spotlight

Everything was good, but these were my favs!"}
{"text":"Wow..my favorite drink place 21 Bar and Restaurant changed to this new modern type of sushi/drink bar and restaurant. I used to come here all the time and loved their environment. I came to this new concept/ their Grand opening and they still have it!!! Yes!!!! Now I can have most of stuff that I used to have and plus fresh sushi!!!! I can't ask more than that haha. Love this place still and even better!!!!I do have karaoke event here every last Friday of the month and l love how they have full bar and have karaoke rooms at the same time!!! Their foods are great and love the friendly staff!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great some of the best sushi i have ever had.  So fresh, and tasty.  I  plan on coming  back here very  soon. I  can  see this being my gi to place, when i am looking for some great sushi. I  want to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I was seriously impressed with how accommodating the manager (Ryan) was in hosting an event I planned - the Savage Saturday Metal Meetup - at Fish in the Spotlight. For starters, he responded immediately to my Facebook message inquiry at 10PM and followed up with a phone call less than 1 minute later. Ryan offered to let us take over a private karaoke room and was gracious enough to let everyone pay separately with separate checks (I asked in advance because this is extremely important to me!).    

The night of the event, Ryan and the Fish in the Spotlight staff greeted me immediately and were prepared to host our group. Our event coincided with FITS open bar special, which was offered every Friday and Saturday night for the month of June from 9-10PM with a $5 minimum purchase. While our group didn't get to take advantage of this special as much as we wanted to, it's safe to say mostly everyone got at least 2 drinks each. Our group of 13 all trickled in at different times, but the staff did a decent job at checking in and seeing if we were okay. 

OREO TEMPURA ($6): I only got dessert since I wasn't too hungry. The oreos tasted great! Not a big fan of the ice cream though. Two drafts of Sapporo complemented my meal 4/5  

VIBE: There's a beer pong table by the bar and karaoke is available. Everyone was pleasantly surprised at the wide selection of music that was offered. They had Slipknot and the Deftones for goodness sake! We didn't take advantage of the karaoke ($35 per hour), maybe next time. The bathrooms cracked me up. Posters of Channing Tatum and David Beckham plastered the walls, even in the stall! I was told the men's bathroom only had one lonely poster of some random female. Sorry boys lol. 

SERVICE: The manager goes above and beyond to make sure you're happy. I think we overwhelmed them with all the separate checks, but they made it work! There was a waitress-in-training helping us that night, so she was still learning the ropes.   

Worth a Return Visit?
I'd like to come back and try more of the menu. Another meetup here is in the works!

{"text":"Hidden Gem -- This place is where people need to start coming!

Besides the KPop Playlist, this place defiantly has a modern bar-like environment. From the light up decor (literally the tables and menus lit up) to the funny quotes on the walls and the hundreds of drooling hot celebrity pictures in the girls bathroom, this place has the makings of a great bar and night time hangout spot. There is a photoback drop spot set up, beer pong tables, and a dj/dance floor area being set up.

I went on a Thursday night and my table one of the few tables in the entire restaurant, but the workers said that its usually packed on the weekends. I'm guessing its because of their happy hour deal from 9-10pm: All you can drink wells drinks for some crazy low cost (I think she said $5 with a purchase but I forgot). 

But what I can actually rave about is their food. Oh my goodness, I wasn't expecting how amazing the food was! We ordered baked muscles, Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll (x2), Miso Salmon, Hamachi Steak, and Yellowtail kama all for a total of $45. Everything we ate was AMAZING. Portions were very reasonable for the prices. My favorite was the Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll. So good that we actually ordered it TWICE during the same meal. 

Recommendations:
- Spicy Garlic Tuna Roll: $9
- Miso Salmon: $5
- Baked Muscles: $5

{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this place!!! The food was good and the staff was really friendly. not to mention the ladies restroom is just beautiful! hahah  the chef made my boyfriend and I Japanese Lasagna (it wasn't on the menu) but he made it anyways and it was delicious!!! I didn't have any drinks there but I heard that they do unlimited well drinks on Saturdays! I'll defiantly be back again to eat/drink soon! They have beer pong set up too so that's fun! 
The food was a great price, too!! We were stuffed when we left and it was only like 40 bucks for like 4 huge rolls, soup and pot stickers! I definitely recommend going there :)"}
