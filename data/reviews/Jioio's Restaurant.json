{"text":"Great Italian food at reasonable prices, but beware if you don't like a sweet sauce, you won't like theirs.  Jioios uses a sweeter sauce than most and the result is a less tart taste. The pizza is a thin crust with the sweet sauce and just the right amount of topping, though its not a crispy crust.
Their salads are huge and too much for a lunch but great for dinner.
All in all this is probably the best place to eat along that stretch of 30 for a few miles."}
{"text":"If you don't like sugar in the crust don't waste your time going. The put sugar and it's a sweet taste. Something different than regular pizza."}
{"text":"Worst meal I have ever have. Simple lasagne. Marinara was weird tasting.  Lied to about pasta being fresh. Cheese tasted rancid."}
{"text":"Very watery sauce.  Food overall seems to be Italian via food service.  Nothing tastes very authentic.  Dining is overly bright and decor is more of a Denny's feel than an Italian restaurant.   There are 100 other places that are as good for pizza and much more convenient."}
{"text":"They pizza is evil good! I have seen sacks of sugar out in the back. The sauce is so sweet but it works so well. We always bring some out to California when we go visit delmont. The wedding soups is good and so are the meatballs. Chicken tenders fries, it's all really good we'll made food. & it doesn't hurt they have all sorts of beer. The service is great!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend as we both like Italian . Greeted quickly and friendly, and were seated immediately. Waitress was very helpful and pleasant. Soup and salad were good and entrees came on the expected time . I had fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and it was slightly above average and plentiful. My friend had pasta primavera and said that it was awesome. I would certainly go back again. Oh and reStrooms were clean,"}
{"text":"I ordered lasagna and table mates ordered crabcake, chicken parm, and pasta. I find the pasta dishes to be average but not special. Crabcake was much the same. Service was slow especially when waiting for our check. The spaghetti sauce at this place is also sweeter, like many have described the pizza sauce. I will be honest and say I don't prefer my sauce so sweet. It is also loaded with garlic. If you like a sweeter sauce with more garlic and not so many herbs then this is your place. Funny thing is, this sauce reminds me of several other places in the area. Do they have the same recipe or just use the same basic food service sauce doctored up. No one at the table was blown away by their food but everyone thought it was ok. One interesting thing to note is that they have the letter \"N\" in their sign backwards. Do they know?"}
{"text":"I love the signature Jioios sauces... but this location is the worst. The portions are small, the beer is ridiculous (4.25 for a miller lite?). The pizza is even light on the cheeze.

The Jioios in Carbon/Greensburg has this place beat hands down."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go when I am home.  I just ate here last month and my brother had his rehearsal dinner catered there.

They have some really awesome pizza with sweat sauce and a sweat thin crispy crust.  Either you love it you hate it.  I for one love it!  My favorite is pepperoni with banana peppers.

The back room is nice it you need private space.  They have a projector that you can hook you computer up to.  The only issue with that is that only one person that works there knows anything about it like how to turn it on or where the cords are (and of course they were not there at the time).  We eventually got it working though.

I know this place is not affiliated with the original Jioio's in Carbon, but I think the pizza is pretty similar.  Both very good."}
{"text":"Friday night dinner with the family at Jioio's Irwin tonight - I grew up near Latrobe and love, love, LOVE this pizza so I was super excited, as we have had good experiences in the past.

First of all, the alcohol is gone - anyone know why they lost their liquor license?

Service was good and the bowl of wedding soup is huge!  Pizza was good as always.

Then the check came - check your bills carefully!  We were over charged on our pizza and drinks - receipt doesn't match the menu!  When I pointed this out to the waiter, he just said that he \"rings it up, doesn't check it\" which kinda annoyed me.  In the end, he did correct our bill to match the menu and we were on our way but I wonder how many people are getting taken for more money in this scheme?

Love their food but very disappointed with our visit tonight."}
{"text":"I am glad that I gave this casual Italian restaurant a try, but the food tasted just OK to my husband and me. The fried sampler appetizer--which consisted of onion rings, mozzarella sticks, breaded cauliflower, breaded mushrooms, and sweet sauces--tasted OK and was way more food than we could fit in our stomachs. My pierogie pizza was not nearly as tasty as what I have gotten at other restaurants. My husband's crab alfredo was \"OK, not great\" according to him. The waitress was friendly and prompt, and the entire restaurant including the bathrooms had been remodeled. We would return to this restaurant if we were in the area again, but we will not seek out the place."}
{"text":"We were passing through and this was recommended by a local.  This place was packed with an older crowd at 5:30 on a Saturday.  They have a broad selection and generous portions.  The service was quick.  While not amazing food, we would definitely eat here again if driving through."}
{"text":"This is another incarnation of the Jioio's in Latrobe - http://www.yelp.com/biz/jioios-restaurant-latrobe - with my absolute favorite pizza. I could eat it all day - and if you live far away like me, remember that the party pizza is cheaper than 2 larges, and reheats well in the oven."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jioio's since I was a little kid. In my opinion, this is the best pizza in America. I've never been to another pizzeria with such a unique flavor. The pizza crust is sweet, crisp, and flaky, almost like a pie crust. The ingredients are light (as far as pizza ingredients go) and flavorful, with a delicious, but not overpowering, sauce. However, with such a light pizza, you can probably take down a lot more slices than your average pizza.

I have noticed that opinions on Jioio's pizza are only on the extremes. People either love it, or they hate it. I've never heard someone say the pizza is just OK.

They have a number of establishments throughout the Greensburg, Latrobe, and North Huntingdon area. It's important to note that while the food is the same at the Greensburg and North Huntingdon locations, they are NOT from the same branch of the Jioio's family tree. They will be very quick to remind you of this. I get the vibe that there is a feud going on among the family. Either way, both establishments have great food and great service.

If you are looking for a totally different, but totally amazing pizza experience, check this place out."}
{"text":"Jioio's pizza is one of the best in town.  Of course, you have to like a sweeter pizza to be a fan, but who doesn't love something sweet!?!  

I am not sure which Jioios are affiliated with each other.  I know that there is three different Jioio's Pizzas; either way, all of them know how to make a great pizza!! Seriously delicious.  

I drive over 20mins just to pick this pizza up!  Please come open up a pizza place in Harrison City.  Not only would I come work for you, I would also be the best customer.  Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"Good family restaurant with good Italian food. Loved the homemade meatballs!  I had baked rigatoni and my son ordered chicken parm. We had leftovers for days."}
{"text":"I grew up in New York. I grew up on Pizza! I know what good Italian food is.
This is not it.
Sauce is watery.
Pizza crust has sugar in it. I asked. They admitted it.
Enough said."}
