{"text":"This cozy small newly renovated restaurant  packs a big punch. The complimentary appetizers are delicious and we received a different variety each visit. We also received a complimentary soup -again, very delicious. The restaurant is known for its Paella's but the menu is varied and offers vegan and gluten free options. We especially liked the fact it is family run and the owner/chef provides personal service. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"We ate last Saturday for the first time at Spice.  Can I say super delicious and fabulous service.  We are making reservations for tonight again bringing along our foodie friends.  Congratulations to Simone for a wonderful addition....we will continue to enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Drive by this place twice a day, and finally decided to stop in and try it.
Nice and friendly atmosphere with the owner and her son running the place.
I ordered the Lamb entree, and as with all entrees they come with a 5 pcs. Appetizer. All were good.
Next comes a soup. I had a Moroccan curry split pea. Very nice.
Then came the Lamb. Awesome!
Will definitely return."}
