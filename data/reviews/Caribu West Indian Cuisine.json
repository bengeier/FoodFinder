{"text":"Hmm, not much to say about this place except good music, and good food. Roti's are the largest I've had in Toronto, only for $10. Their curry's are quite spicy, especially if you add their hot sauce, which is yellow and pretty hot. I like their chow mein, hits the spot when I'm craving a quick stir-fried noodles with some meat. Tastes even better with their hot sauce.  This place is open till late, if you go past 8-9pm, place turns up the music!  3.5/5 for food"}
{"text":"Why are you are gonna advertise that your open until 2am and then close at 11pm ? If business is slow then too bad.... u stay ope because u mever know if customers come when ur closed! Pissed...."}
{"text":"Open late. Call ahead for takeout to confirm kitchen is open. Best curry goat and special chicken fried rice in the area. Super spicy hot sauce!!"}
