{"text":"Definitely my go to Asian cuisine spot for quick and easy and delicious dining! And they have an amazing lunch special menu!"}
{"text":"Got to experience this fabulous place the other day.  It was around 3:30pm (the odd not lunch yet not dinner time) so we were the only ones in there.  The waitress was super nice and very friendly.  The Papas a la Huancaina are fantastic ad I found myself not wanting to stop eating them, the Seco was to-die-for.  IT's slow cooked beef (fall apart) in a broth/sauce and served with white rice and beans.  My friend had the chicken fried rice off the chinese menu and even that was delicious.  Sure, it's $10 for a plate, but I got TWO very healthy servings out of it.  I ate myself silly and then brought home enough leftovers to eat just as big of a portion the next day.  I don't care about the decor, nor what it looks like.  It was clean and the food was delicious, that's all I care about.  So, good job Little Dumpling, I'm definitely going there again before I leave in a few days.  And I may perhaps beg for your Seco recipe."}
{"text":"I love taking my son to this place because the staff are so kind to children. The food taste fresh and the portions are huge for such reasonable prices. I've had a number of items on the menu of with the chicken cashew is a 12 out of 10!"}
{"text":"For a low price you get a lot of food, specially if you buy off the luncheon menu.  I haven't been disappointed once since I started eating here.  The meals are affordable and I believe the service is very good.  I've always been greeted with a smile and was given hot tea during my wait on a cold day when I asked for my order TO GO!"}
{"text":"It was our first time there. It's really dark & small in there. The customer service was not friendly. 

I ordered the chicken pad Thai. The first bite was good. Then it just got sweeter and sweeter. It was drenched in that sweet sauce. I couldn't even finish my meal. The only yummy thing I could finish was egg drop soup. I love crab Rangoon but it tasted like they used a super sweet yogurt as the filling. 
My husband ordered the general tso. His favorite...he couldn't finish his meal. His was also way too sweet. Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"We decided to order take out from this restaurant because we were in the mood for Chinese, and it was amazing! We ordered a general tao, vegetable fried rice, and fried dumplings (I think), and they were all really good and tasted fresh. I don't even really like general tao, but this one was great! 

It was a little pricey, costing $22 for three items, but the portions are pretty big. 

The host at the front door was really helpful and friendly, which was a plus! 

We will definitely return before we leave the area! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The girl that took my order got mad at me cause i couldn't pronounce the words correctly. After getting home with the food it was the most bland Chinese food that I've ever tasted.  I hate panda express but it was better"}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time and got 1 order of chicken and broccoli for $6 incl tax to go, it was ready in less than 5 min and was totally fine, so I hope that they get more good reviews because there are barely ANY restaurants in Henderson that are worth going to~  I was in and out in ~5 minutes. Maybe if you had a bad experience here it was just an off night!"}
{"text":"I've eaten from here three times now and can not complain , really good fried rice , and they use white meat chicken , way better then new York Chinese or any place in the neighborhood ."}
{"text":"This plays DELIVERS which is is definitely a + in my book! 

My fiance really likes their hot and sour soup and I love the panang. 

We have also tried their fried rice and beef broccoli which was just okay. 

They are always very friendly and is it wrong to LOVE the fact that asian people are cooking my asian food? 

For the amount of food we get, it's definitely a great value."}
{"text":"Great food, service and value!  Large portions.  Honey Walnut Shrimp was the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"Wow been going to this place for years and tonight just blew me away. Called in for a pick up order some guy answered first time. Gave order ask if I could pay with CC over the phone not able to because had to be present with my card when picking up. Told him my wife was picking it up to just put the order in and she will pay for it. Dude tells me stop yelling which I wasn't I was just telling him to put it in and she will pay. He hung up. Called back and asked if he hung up on me and said yea and he will hang up again...he did.. What an asshole wanted to drive down and handle it in person but not worth my time.

The owners who has always been great to us may want to review their staff. With this type of shit ass attitude business will decline if it has not done so. 

If you don't mind a drive go to New York chinese or better yet if you want really great chinese food go to Wo Fat look them up. I will never purchase from little dumplings and I will let a lot of people know the new staff sucks ass!!!"}
{"text":"Rude service when asking questions about food. Server was very curt. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now, both times very satisfied. The food is fresh and well prepared, had a few different things on the menu but the panag curry and the broccoli beef are definitely my favorites. Delicious egg rolls and pot stickers as well as the chicken satay."}
{"text":"The food is good. I love the fried wontons. We have only done take out and it has always been very quick. I would have given them 5 stars if only the lady that takes the orders was a little more friendly. She is always right to the point with little to no pleasantries. I don't take it personally I believe it's just the way she is."}
{"text":"Ordered pad thai and some curry, besides it took a long time to complete the order that i placed online it came out and everything was very good.  If i didn't have to wait an additional 20 minutes tacked onto the time they told me it would be 5 stars"}
{"text":"Definately a popular one in the area, with a really good lunch special, and they seem to have a good clientele of regulars. The tai curries are a great option besides the Chinese norms. I always get the steamed rice option for two reasons. First, it comes heart shaped, secondly the fried rice is to salty for me. If you opt to upgrade the soup to wonton, you'll notice its a bigger bowl than the standard lunch special's bowl. They also make really good boba tea."}
{"text":"After ordering from another restaurant a week ago that was completely void of flavor, I decided to try LD. I was pleasantly suprised. I had the food delivered and it arrived in a reasonable amount of time. The food was good, sauces were on the side so the Lemon Chicken and Sweet and Sour Pork were not soggy and the Wonton Soup was huge and good.

I'll definately order again!"}
{"text":"When it comes to fresh quality Thai food, this hole in the wall restaurant definitely makes the cut.

To start off, walking in the first thing I noticed was how tiny it was. There's enough space to seat 22 people. Doesn't pose a negative affect on the experience, but to some people during busy times it can feel a little crowded. The decor isn't all that appealing but again, this isn't some mainstream restaurant. While I waited to order drinks, I read some other reviews and most people complained about a cigarette-like smell; have never had that experience in all my times there. The staff is very friendly and after going in a couple times they have gotten to know me and greet with a cheerful smile and \"Welcome back!\"

My first visit I decided to try the red curry with shrimp. I am a huge fan of red curry so I was ready to put theirs to the test and I can tell you they definitely exceeded the expectations I had for a tiny place like this. Most places are somewhat stingy when it comes to picking a meat other than chicken and they loaded it with plenty of shrimp. I also really enjoy chicken pad thai and after experiencing these two dishes I was in love with this place. Their pad thai noodles didn't have that \"just microwaved\" shiny look some other places have and feature a perfect blend of peanut taste. Grand China is an absolute disaster compared to this place. 

The other day I tried out their lunch special for the first time and for $5.95 the portions are extremely generous. They are about as big as if you went in for dinner, plus you get the choice of egg drop soup or sweet and sour soup along with an egg roll. This time I went with the orange chicken and it was awesome. The chicken wasn't too crispy or too soft and the flavor was on point. I have been craving it ever since. If you enjoy boba tea this is a good place to get some as well.

All in all, this place is a must try. The prices are cheap, the portions are big and the flavor and quality is above the rest in this price range. They deliver too so that's a huge plus. Try it out, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry what was I smoking the day I reviewed last time?!?! 
Pros: if you are high go here & get lunch special!!
Cons: if you are NOT high do not go here & get the lunch special

(lunch special : pad Thai? Ok wtf was that fettuccine with peanuts / wha happen to vermicelli ?!??! & flavor where was the flavor hiding) my bad I dunno 
Cute place / lottsa potential/ same server as last time nice guy & over worked -some skinny guy 1/2 his age was like straight up snapping his fingers @ the server-"}
{"text":"I can't review the quality of food for this business as I never received any. I ordered online at 9:45 with a 10pm pick up time. I arrived at 9:50 and the lights were out and it looked like they had been closed for quite some time. Waste of time and gas. Would be nice if you disabled your online ordering if you are unable to fill an order."}
{"text":"Listen guys.. You're better off at Panda Express. 

First time here and I must say it was not pleasant. 
2 stars are simple. 1st goes to the outstanding service, 2nd for clean environment.

I wish.. I WISH, I could say the food deserves a couple stars but unfortunately not. Those who gave more than 2 stars must have no tastebuds or could care less for freshly cooked quality meals (just saying). 

I think the egg drop soup was the best out of the meal I ordered. 

I ordered the sweet & sour chicken, egg-roll and pork fried rice combo. 

I knew I should've ordered the white steamed rice.
The pork fried rice looked suspect as hell. Tasted like it was a week old. Very bland and dry tasting. Took one bite and called it a day.. 

Seems like they buy the egg-rolls frozen and just throw it in the oven. Idk but once I bit into it, straight MUSH.. I immediately spit that into my napkin. Like honestly who messes up on an egg-roll? 

The sweet and sour chicken was alright, besides the fact it wasn't as crisp as I hoped it'd be.. Soggy from the watery consistency of the sauce perhaps? The whole meal wasn't even hot! Cmonnnnnnnnn man!

My cousin ordered the magnolian beef combo.. And that just didn't look appetizing at all. Thats all I have to say about that.. 

I believe in second chances but sometimes once is enough. 

Sorry not sorry Little Dumplings. Step it up in the kitchen! You're at a great location thats constantly busy, hope you guys make it work somehow. Take these reviews into consideration for your business's sake. 

Cheers."}
{"text":"Little Dumplings, great  food is back! I hadn't ordered take out for awhile, but I must say the food was perfectly fresh, hot  and delicious! The customer service phone order and delivery were very good, pleasant, friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Aside from the musty odor in this place I am a huge fan. The service is fast, the lunch specials are great and the food is delicious. My go to is the orange chicken (always hot and crispy) and pork fried rice."}
{"text":"Little Dumplings? More like Little Dankums. I would've taken a picture but it smelled so good that I couldn't wait to dig in. Let's start with the orange chicken. Tasty sauce and moist pieces of chicken makes for a mouthful of YUM YUM. The sweet and sour chicken was also a pleasant surprise. 

Those rangoons though... Heavenly flavored, crispy, crustacean centered nuggets of pure joy. This is a joy similar to getting your toes wet at the beach for the first time in years, with warm and calm water, and seeing a shooting star take a six second stroll across the sky. The initial crunch is enough to raise an eyebrow, and the creamy filling seals the deal like car salesman on cocaine. Absurdly amazing. 

Rice was done right. Perfectly cooked. 

The free veggie rolls they added in were also fantastic. Nothing was undercooked or overlooked. 

I will be looking forward to my next meal, where I will try something new, but also double up on rangoons."}
{"text":"We've ordered 3 times from here. It's really close by where I live so when there's a craving for oily, sweet, and salty, this is a go-to spot. Delivery took 30-35 minutes, which wasn't too bad. The price ain't bad either.

Everything we get here, like Pad Thai and Orange Chicken, is savory and flavorful, like you want to come back for more (I mean, I could add white rice [which comes with it if you order an entree like Orange Chicken] to the Pad Thai to get a tamer flavor). You should see their large Shrimp Fried Rice - there was a good amount of jumbo shrimp in there, and it's certainly addicting. 

The first time we ordered from them, the lady seemed nice. Our second order, which was a phone call pickup order, my mom perceived her as rude and lacking customer service, but I don't expect good customer service from a restaurant soldiered by about two people. Case in point, I call to order from now on. She likes it quick and to the point. 

To conclude, if you're close by their location, they serve deliciously unhealthy Chinese - Thai food to satisfy those burning cravings. :)"}
{"text":"I've been going to little dumplings for approximately 3 years .The food used to be excellent ,but within the last year I I've noticed a change twice in the quality of food meaning freshness as well as this service.I no longer advice support of this restaurant 40 dollars down the drain with attitude to boot !!!"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. 
There are dishes that we absolutly love and then some that are ...meh. 

Love: Crab Rangoon, Honey Walnut Shrimp, General Tso's(but it's not spicy), Twice Cooked Pork
Not So Great: Sweet at Sour, BBQ Pork Appetizer, Fried Rice including Pineapple

My husband is the Thai food eater and he says their Thai food fullfill's the craving. It's good but isn't the best he's ever had. 

I do love that they have online ordering! I added the web addess to the info. Just keep in mind you can't use thsoe 15% coupons online.

Here is the site in case it takes a while for Yelp to update the info: http://www.littledumplinglv.com/"}
{"text":"We routinely get takeout from little dumpling.  The crab Rangoon are the best out of all of the takeout places in this area that we have tried.  We like the cashew chicken, chow mein, sesame chicken, and beef with broccoli.  Their Mongolian beef is too spicy for us, but if that's your thing you will probably like it.  Their lunch specials are a great deal!"}
{"text":"We tried this place on a Tuesday thinking it was a chain with the little dumpling on Decatur and 215 (that is closed on Tuesdays).  Not only is it not a chain, it is not very good.  We were very disappointed with the crab Rangoon, chow mein and pad Thai.  We tried them a second time just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, and we were disappointed again.  Drive a little further down 215 to Decatur instead."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT EXPERIENCE
This was not only a VERY awkward experience but also annoying! We reside close to this location and decided to give it a whirl. There were a few other patrons waiting for their take out items and one couple dining in. This is definitely not an establishment primed for dining in, and if you must try for yourself, I would strongly recommend to download their menu and call ahead. We waited nearly 10 minutes for someone to greet us. Now mind you, during this wait period, we managed to see the delivery gal stream out of the door and the cashier look directly at us before grabbing her infant, taking him to the kitchen and tending to him prior to taking our order. Being a mother, myself, I patiently looked past the initial lack of customer service... I mean, I came for take out... My expectation was in the quality of the food.
During the wait; which felt like an eternity, we took notice of the dirty floors, another worker, most likely the owner's, 5-6 year old daughter roaming around to EVERY patron and asking to play on their phones. She sat next to us as we waited and began to flip through my phone inquiring of my game apps. At first it was endearing but became rapidly annoying as she also took my husband's phone to do the same. As our food finally arrived, she REFUSED to give back the phones! I literally had to pry the phones from her hands as she kicked and laid on top of them! She then refused to let me out of the booth!!! My husband had to move the table and I had to literally climb over her! The woman at the counter said NOTHING!!! We grabbed our condiments and scooted out as fast as possible... Only to find that our Chicken Teriyaki bowl was missing. We reluctantly went back in to be told that it would be another 10-15 minutes. During the interim, this little girl went up to 2 male patrons and proceeded to take and also play on their IPhones. When they too tried to depart she ran out of the place and across the parking!!! They went out after her and the lady finally came out from the counter, retrieved the guy's phone and left her alone again. Not a word to the little girl!!! A new family walked in and she proceeded again. This time she took their little boy's toy and ran around the entire place! He kept attempting to grab his toy back and she would run. How is this even possible??? Wow!!! 
I would love to say the food was fantastic and it was well worth it but unfortunately the Wor Won Ton Soup was extremely salty and consisted of 4 wontons, 2 shrimp, 2 snap peas, a few slices of pork and NO veggies!!! The Veggie Fried Rice was extremely bland and could say the same for the Chicken Teriyaki. The Veggie Egg Rolls weren't cooked internally and our rice container was maybe 3/4 full... Really less for a family of 3 that we paid additionally for. 
So not only was the food sub par, next to awful... But the customer service is non-existent and you become an instant babysitter for the establishment without ANY reward. Makes you wonder how cleanly the kitchen staff really is when they are changing diapers from the same kitchen they are preparing your food. By the way - It took  45 minutes to complete our order."}
{"text":"Tasty food and excellent and friendly service!! It is really more of a take-out place, but my husband and I come here every week for a \"sit down\" lunch, and we love it. It is a very clean and quiet place to eat. In addition, the staff is wonderful and kind. We enjoy trying different dishes - from the more American-Chinese style to the more authentic Chinese dishes they actually make, and all of them are delicious and tasty. We highly recommend Little Dumpling!"}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order last week for Pad See Ewe with beef. Delivery was quick, about 30 minutes. When I opened up the box, I thought that they gave me the wrong meal because whatever that food was, it was NOT pad see ewe. It looked and tasted like a stir fry dish. It had small skinny noodles, bell peppers, jalapeños, tons of onions and veggies. There was no sauce like the traditional pad see ewe has, and no large flat noodles either. I called them to ask for a refund because they didn't give me pad see ewe, and instead of apologizing and giving me a refund, the manager argued with me and told me that's the way that they make pad see ewe, and that I can't get my money back, only a credit for my next order. I'm very disappointed with Little Dumpling overall, the quality of food and customer service was awful. 

If you want real Thai food, don't go here!"}
{"text":"The food is great and plenty. The service is fast and friendly. Dinner for two should come in around $20 - $30 max. Deliver or pick up."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Price wise, very decent. Portion size, very decent. Decor, small but roomy. I liked it, so far the better of the asian cuisines I have been at in the last three years. Now, I give 4 stars only because its not the BEST, but its really good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant was very disappointing, each employee at this restaurant stayed on their cell phone.
As I was paying my bill not only did the waitress not walk up to my table, I had to walk up to pay for my check because the waitress was too busy on her cell phone sitting at the front & each cook in the back was standing there on their cell phones as well. As you can see the color the pad Thai is not appetizing & it was awful. This place really does not serve delicious Thai or Chinese food. Do not get the crab Rangoon unless you just want to big ball of cream cheese yellow grease oozing out! Yuck!!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese. I ordered delivery here. It was very fast and easy. Plus they understood me on the phone which was a relief. I had general tsos and it was very tasty. Not gonna say much since it was delivery but for sure fast, easy and yummy! :)"}
{"text":"Eh chicken chomein was good. Needed more chicken in it. 

Salt and pepper shrimp was bland and soggy so I was not impressed. There's an easy way to vent the styrofoam box so customers don't end up with certain soggy foods. 

We had it delivered and it came quickly. The driver was nice enough. We ordered off the eat24 where you prepay but the driver had us sign a copy. #first 
Didn't get any silverware but we survived. 

Overall we'd try them again. Maybe order the dumplings."}
{"text":"The egg drop soap and orange chicken is great!! It seems the decor could be updated especially the bathroom. Definitely would go back!!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for a few years, the food has always been hot and fresh tasting, and always ready when I come to pick it up, not always the friendliest customer service but I don't care best Chinese food in town and you can always see in the kitchen."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly and love it. 

I long for the old-fashioned large Chinese-American crispy (but not greasy) egg rolls.  Unfortunately, like everywhere else in Las Vegas, they're not to be found here. 

While this is clearly not a \"gourmet\" place,  we've never been disappointed by any offering in 3 years!"}
{"text":"How do you serve spare ribs and not have 
Wet naps or moist towel to clean up afterwards? Ribs were tasty but not hot!
The wor wonton again was tasty but not hot enough.  Yelp is telling me my review is too short but , nothing left to say!"}
{"text":"Honestly I had a great experience and I ordered on grub hub. Usually grub hub orders take a long time and they bring my food cold but not from little dumpling. I ordered orange chicken and their appetizer combo with steamed rice. First off it was ALOT OF FOOD and it tasted great. I liked it definitely replacing Panda Express from now on!"}
{"text":"I JUST ORDERED FROM THIS PLACE....
Being that in my job i am not able to walk away from my post to go get lunch, i decided chinese food sounded great and found this place.. amazing prices and delicious looking meals.. I called to order mine and other coworkers food. The woman on the line was very attentive and kind. Gave me my total and the amount of time it would take for them to arrive at my location. I had asked the woman about the $2 delivery charge on their website. she informed me that the charge is to TIP THE DRIVER. I said thank you and hung up. After the 45 minute wait for my food, a man came into my place of work and dropped it off. i handed him the cash and he counted it in front of me. then he turns around from the door and says \"no more tip for me?\" I had informed him that there was extra cash in there from what our total was and that the woman who answered the call and took our order had said the tip for him was already in my bill.. he began to ask who i had spoken to and kept saying that the tip was not included. 

I must say that i was incredibly upset about this mans attitude. If someone at your place of business informs a customer that tip is already included in their bill for their food, that is what it is.. and if they don't actually do it that way, the woman needs to make sure not to inform costumers of that. 

Besides that, the food smells great, however i am too appalled by the attitude of that man to even desire to try it at the moment. Needless to say i will try the food and possibly go in, if i can get over the attitude of the man. Sad to have the first interaction with a new place be like this."}
{"text":"The food is really good here. It's faster to go in and order the food than get delivery, however it is nice that they have delivery. I try to plan ahead if I do delivery and order it before I know I'll be hungry. I always order the Orange Chicken, Lemon Chicken or their Sweet and Sour. You can't really go wrong with the food here."}
{"text":"Ordered Cashew Chickew and the chicken was horrible.  Tasted old, chewy, and dry.  Lots of similar reviews and I have to agree."}
{"text":"Came in with my daughter and the service was great and the food we ordered was delicious! Huge portions!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! We ordered the Tom Kha- Gai soup and the togo Styrofoam container literary melted into my soup. I could not eat it. 
We also ordered the yellow curry chicken and the spring rolls. The yellow curry chicken tasted like plain cream of chicken soup out of a can and the springs rolls tasted like the ones from Panda Express. 

We called and they said sorry for the soup being to hot and causing the Styrofoam to melt into your soup, but there is nothing we can do. 

We will never go back!"}
{"text":"I got the pineapple fried rice, salt and pepper shrimp and Hong Kong pan fried noodles.  They were all pretty good and they even threw in a bbq pork fried rice for free.  It's your standard American-Chinese food  but compared to the others I have had in Vegas, it is quite a bit better.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went for a sit down meal.  It was self seating and sat by the door.  I was ignored by the host manning the register and the waitress for 5 minutes.  Another patron entered and did self seating and received service in about 3 minutes.  Waitress then got the patron their drink order and finally asked if I was picking up an order.  I replied with nope I an eating in she said okay and proceeded to go about the restaurant to tend to other patrons obviously not having heard my response.  Finally after about 15 minutes total time I decided to leave after never having seen a menu.   
There were  about 7 other patrons in the restaurant when I arrived so the busy and seemingly rushed waitress must have been helping with take out orders.  I may give them another shot in the future as I have no clue what the food is actually like."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and when I called to order the lady that took my order was SO helpful pointing out what had fish sauce or what could be substituted. She was amazing and finding a helpful and informative employee is so hard to come by. On top of the amazing service I had the best freaking curry I've ever had in my life and I lived in England where everything is Indian and Thai food. The PINEAPPLE CURRY was beyond words. It is so good especially with white rice but in my order we also got the CURRY FRIED RICE and that was so delicious! It really hit the spot. If you eat here, and you most definitely should. Get the curry dishes because they are on point.  And also any of the meat dishes can be substituted for tofu. Which by he way the fried tofu appetizer is so good, it's fried like fried chicken but without the gross greasy dead bird taste."}
{"text":"Just a little hole in the wall located in a strip mall.  We've been coming here for some time now and always walk away satisfied and stuffed!

First off the lunch specials are enough to make you want to at least try it once-the food will make you come back for more.  $5.95 lunch specials to include soup, egg roll, rice and the crunchy noodles that you dip in sweet and sour-all to include your main dish with any type of meat you want and any level of spice you can customize.  The portions are gigantic-always.  I never can eat everything and usually take half of it to go.  The Chicken Pad Thai is what I usually order and I am never disappointed.  I order it a spicy 8 (from a 1 - 10 level).  It rarely is spicy enough for me (I can hear my BF now....blah blah blah) but I'm afraid that one day it will be really a spicy 8. LOL

Saturday was an odd day.  They usually have this cute teenager girl working the cashier and tables.  The cook, who I assume is the owner?, was doing it all as I believed him to be the only one there.  I must say that the guy handled it pretty well considering he had several tables occupied yet he still made time to check on them occasionally.  Gotta love a man who can multi-task!  

I ordered the Mongolian Chicken. I was in the mood for rice versus noodles this time.  The dish came with the rice on the side with the Mongolian chicken, onion and green onion.  While the chicken was very tasty, dang there were a lot of onions!  Like I said the portions they give you are so big so it didn't matter to me too much.  I just didn't eat most of the onions.  I didn't eat the eggroll that it came with.  It looked greasy and I rarely will eat them just because of that.  The BF ordered the Mongolian Beef.  That's what he always orders and it is always consistently yummy.

I always notice people picking up to go orders and there are always people seated as well.  They have a TV going that is muted BUT there is music that's playing that makes me want to actually rip my hair out.  For real.  Something about Celine Dion versus Thai food doesn't mesh well with me. hehe

Anyways....Good food.  Big portions.  Cheap eats.  Can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Quick friendly service. Very good food. Great soups."}
{"text":"My sister in law ordered food catered from here for my moms 80th birthday.I was visiting from California and I love Thai food and Chinese food and eat lots and have had lots of different places.The Orange Chicken and Egg rolls were very good.Actually great.As was the fried rice and noodles.I have had better Satay, but this was good  and I judge for overall eating experience and this one was so good.There was so much good food and they delivered and really laid out the spread very nice.
I don't eat Broccoli but the beef and broccoli looked very good.
What made my day and I crave for all the time was the peppered beef and the best Pork that I have ever eaten in my life I really don't know the name but is was a breaded pork that was a little bit spicy and the BOMB!I mean the Bomb.I love Spicy..

I can't wait till I go here in person and I will take some of that pork and put in freezer and take back to California with me.
I will be coming here and eating this awesome food.
I would recommend this food to be catered at a party to anyone .
Your party will be a hit..
Right on!Bring your awesome place to Cali..
I love your food and could not get enough..EAT HERE WHEN IN LAS VEGAS.GREAT THAI AND CHINESE FOOD....."}

{"text":"Ordered teriyaki bowl, pot stickers and combination chow mein. 

Teriyaki bowl was over sauced, lacked flavor and was not very pleasant to look at.

Pot stickers were mushy and all stuck together. The texture was less than desirable. It was my least favorite item I ordered. I could only eat one and I had to throw the rest away. Everything about them was gross.

Combination chow mein was the ONLY reason I gave this place two stars. It was actually pretty good and basically the only thing I ate."}

{"text":"Over all not bad. Definitely had worse. The waitress didn't seem to be up on the menu very well but they do have a small kids menu which is so rare for Asian cuisine. The pad Thai is ok but way over sauced. My husbands chicken chow mani was very very good but a very small portion. Kids sweet and sour comes with the sauce on the side which is nice the chicken and rice are enough food the horribly awful  ragoons should just me left off the meal bc they are defiantly the worst in town. 
Decor is kinda intimate so it's very surprising they have a kids menu. First glance this place does not look kid friendly. 
I don't know if we'll be back foods not bad service was ok overall pretty clean but just not overly impressed. Lots of calls for take out and no one else dinning in. Maybe there's a reason for that."}
{"text":"My real issue is with the service. If I order food to go and you tell me it will be 30 mins, fine. But when we hit the 60 minute mark and you told me you hadn't even started my food yet? Seriously? You could have at least offered me a drink while I waited for you to apparently travel to freaking China to get my freaking food. Long story short, we left with our money and no food. Sadly you don't remember us as one of your regular customers. But I'm sure you'd recognize us now if we ever came back."}
{"text":"My go to place for lunch or take out. The food is good,  service is quick and friendly, and the price is right - especially for the large portions they serve."}
{"text":"This is our second trip to this place. Had combination platter. The shrimps are wrapped with thick flour, chicken barbecue & ribs no taste. The whole platter hardly have any flavors. General Tsos chicken practically soaked in water. Singapore noodle fairly dry. 

On our first trip, we thought we found a nice restaurant where we can visit once in while. Soup was great. General Tsos chicken, which is my favorite was good as well. But after this second visit, I don't think I'll ever be back. Sorry, they could have made some delicious meals for our dinner."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas from San Jose hubby and I were craving dumpling so we ended here its far from the strip but the pictures on yelp looked good !  So we ordered the only dumpling on the menu we also ordered pad thai and thai fried rice lol the food came out on paper plates both dishes had NO flavor the girl was friendly its not her fault the food sucked maybe they should take a trip to SJ and learn how good food is supppse to taste what a waste of the 20 min it took ;( gross"}
{"text":"Since discovering Little Dumpling earlier this year we've been at least 10 times...and every time the food and service has been excellent! We've tried quite a few dishes and all have been tasty. Sometimes we go just for the wonton soup and crab rangoons. So happy we found Little Dumpling!"}
{"text":"Definite gem. Amazing food. My wife and I ordered green curry, egg foo young, wor wonton soup. Even though it was small inside, the door was constantly opening with carry out customers and sit down diners. Food was amazing, could be spicier, but for the average American it had a decent amount of heat."}
{"text":"Oh gosh...I haven't had Chinese food in a while so I ordered it. I got chow mein and chow fun.... holy crap, it was bad. The noodles were gross, they were gooey and sticky, the taste was so off, I ended up throwing all my food away, besides 2 spring rolls that were halfway edible.

People that enjoyed this food are probably people that love TV Dinners, but if you have some self respect you'll stay away."}
{"text":"pork egg foo young is amazing!"}
{"text":"This was a nice restaurant, clean and friendly staff, although the inside is a little dark, you get your food pretty fast. The food was good but not great, my boyfriend ordered the orange chicken and my friend ordered the general tso chicken but they looked exactly the same. The soup was good and I like how they give you fried wontons as a free appetizer. Good place overall."}
{"text":"Where have all the good Chinese restaurants gone? I recently moved to this side of town and decided that I would try it out. 

I got the vegetable lo mein, easy enough, nothing that should be messed up in a Chinese place. I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. 

I decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. 

I will never be going back. I will though continue my search for good food in Henderson! Wish me luck..."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. Crab Rangoon has no crab, not even an attempt at crab flavor. Panang curry is awful, no flavor, no spice, it's more like a bland gravy. So so bummed."}
{"text":"I probably order from LD every weekend.. Always fast, fresh and delicious..Pad Thai and Chef's Hong Kong noodles are fantastic..when I'm visiting my daughter the first idea is \"let's order lil dumpling..\" You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from this place about once per month over the last two years.  Overall, it has been good and compared to other local Chinese places - it is the best in the area.

The \"thai\" food is mediocre.  I'll leave it at that.  You want good thai food, good luck around here.

We have dinned in as well and it is casual.  Nothing fancy here."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place after a weekday trip to Costco. It is nicely decorated and has a large lunch specials menu. Although it was midafternoon, I was still surprised that we were the only diners in the place. Maybe that's because the food was hit and miss.

Whenever I try a new thai restaurant, I always order the pad thai. This was a goopy concoction with oversweet sauce and rubbery shrimp. Not appealing at all. My husband lucked out in ordering the beef and snow peas. The meat was served in a tasty teriyaki sauce with crunchy snow peas, onions, and water chestnuts. His fried rice was so-so, and our spring rolls were obviously frozen, but each of our soups (egg drop for him, hot and sour for me) was good, and our server was prompt and pleasant.

This restaurant is far enough away from my house that I'll probably never return. But Little Dumpling better step up its game if it wants to lure diners in a strip mall that's filled with other ethnic offerings. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I think I'll stop in next door at Geisha House. (Or I might just opt for a Costco hot dog...)"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place two stars but I had to increase my rating to three stars. I gave this place a three star rating because they deliver and their quick. I was desperate for Thai and called at least 9 other places for delivery. Just my luck, none of them delivered to my area. Unfortunately, the restaurants I called prior to calling Little Dumpling are all the four star rated ones. Once I got my first \"yes, I deliver to your home.\" I decided to give Little Dumplings a shot. They told me the delivery would take 40 minutes the delivery guy came ringing my door bell in 30. I ordered yellow thai curry, boba tea, and the dumplings. 

First I had the yellow thai curry. It was savory and just the right kind of spicy. I didn't tear up or have major difficulties eating this dish. I personally don't like that kind of spicy. At the same time I wasn't left wondering why my dish wasn't hot enough. If I could change one thing it would be the packaging. The sauce was dripping out of the box that they packed it in. They put the curry and the rice in one Styrofoam box. It would've been better if they put the curry in the same type of container that they put their soup in. 

Next I had the boba tea. I had it for the first time and only ordered it because of a review I read on here. It isn't really my preferred taste but it wasn't disgusting. They gave me a large boba tea instead of small one for the same price. 

So finally let's move on to the dumplings. I saved the worst for last. Honestly, the dumplings sucked. Ironically this place is called Little Dumpling so I would only imagine their dumplings being their best dish. Wrong, they had a burnt taste to them and I gagged after eating it. I don't really have anything else to say about the dumplings cause I took a bite out of one and contemplated throwing them all out. I may have gotten a bad batch. It may be cause my stomach is sensitive right now. So I wouldn't call this a deal breaker

All in all, I am a fan of the customer service, delivery time, price, and the yellow curry. The dumplings surely do need work though. I will give this place another shot in the future. Little Dumpling is definitely worth a try if you're looking to get a quick bite... just stay away from the dumplings or order them at your own risk."}
{"text":"We have never eaten in the actual restaurant but typically order take out from here. I like the option to choose from either Chinese or Thai items. I love their Panang. The portions are a good size. I find it strange that they only serve a very small container of steamed rice with the entrees. Seems a bit cheap to me since most other restaurants give you a big serving with an entree. The food tastes fresh so we come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by here with a couple friends for lunch. They had recommended it. It's in the neighborhood, but I had never been in. Great lunch specials and the service was friendly. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Used to be that when I moved to a new place the first thing I would do is order Chinese food. 3 years ago I moved to Spokane and that ended with some of the worst food ever. Fast forward 3 years to Henderson. Decided to try Little Dumpling, as gun shy of Chinese food as I am. General Tso's and Sweet & Sour Chicken were both drier than the surrounding desert. Pork Fried Rice was fair. Strike 1 Henderson Chinese food!"}
{"text":"This place is small and a little dark inside but that has zero to do with how wonderful their food is. 

Stopped in on a whim due to craving pad thai. We ordered egg rolls, which were crispy and flavorful. The chicken pad thai was great. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the spice level(1-10) was spot on. We also ordered chicken chow fun (sp?) and it tasted awesome. 

They deliver within a 6 mile radius which we fit into! Yay! This will be our go to thai while feeling lazy at home! Customer service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Baaddddd place!!!! Dont ever go here for anything! Such a rude front girl working here! I called for pick up and she just literally want to hang up the phone and i am not yet done ordering!!!! If i can just put no stars i will do it! This is the first time i encounter such rudeness like this! Not even saying thank you to a customer! She just point out that my order is done and i can leave!"}
{"text":"Yummy! We ate orange chicken, chicken chow fun and combo fried rice. Service is great and atmosphere is beautiful. You gotta try this place!!"}
{"text":"Being from NY I've been trying to find a GOOD Chinese takeout spot that can compare to the ones back home. This is the closest I've come. The food was the best Chinese takeout I've had since I've moved to NV, however not even close to what I've had in NY. I ordered my food to be delivered and the woman on the phone was extremely nice. The one that delivered my food was as well. The only thing that really bothers me about this place is that it doesn't serve dumplings!!!!!!! It has pot stickers but no dumplings... and no, they're not the same thing. My kingdom for a dumpling!"}
{"text":"Good peruvian not like mi peru"}
{"text":"Decent food, ordered the Pad Thai, was tasty but real sweet. I don't honestly know much about Thai food but do kno was different than the Pad Thai at Archies. I asked how spicy it came n was told it wasn't.  So I asked if the cook was heavy handed (hahaha) the poor girl had no idea what I was talking about, so I ordered a 7.  The sweet flavor overpowered the spice.  Dnt hate it, just different."}
{"text":"This food was not good.  Very disappointing.  The ribs were tough and bland, the shrimp was dry, over cooked and bleh, The eggrolls were flavorless.  The crab rangoon was basically just creamcheese filling.  Just not good.  The kung pao chicken was inedible.  It had a weird sour taste to it, not that it had gone bad, just not good food.  Very sorry we spent our money here.  We will not be returning.  We enjoy China-a-go-go on Valle Verde a lot better than this.  It isn't fabulous, but we are always satisfied.  Also, the delivery took well over an hour after ordering without any forewarning.  Not happy at all."}
{"text":"Very good eaten at the restaurant and had home delivery.  Everything is very good, maybe not up to San Francisco but again this is Vegas.  My only suggestion is they cut the meat in smaller pieces.  Will i go back, o'course.  Hint, order the items marked spicey on the menu!"}
{"text":"I placed a delivery order from this location  this past weekend, using my Eat 24 Yelp account. I placed a tip on my order for delivery person, but when he showed up he kept pointing at my receipt that said cash where the tip amount should've been. I couldn't really understand what he was saying, until he showed obvious anger that I wasn't going to give him cash. I set this account up so I wouldn't have to bother about always having cash, the fact that he would get so angry and forceful...was a bit scary. He was acting like he was going to hold my food back!? I am actually just realizing how upset he made me. I will not ever order from there again...I mean they are like 5 min from my apts. And that man was trying to intimidate me for a 10% tip! That's the second time I've had a delivery person get confrontational and nasty, what the heck is going on? Why is the tips I designate at order not processing and since when is it ok for a delivery person to threaten a paying customer for a tip???  I would suggest being cautious when ordering from here!

{"text":"This Little Dumpling offers the best Chinese food in a 5 mile radius. Note that there is another restaurant with the same name nearby, but make sure you choose this one instead. Food is really good and the prices are reasonable, especially if you go during the lunch special! Delivery is always on time and the orders are always just as we requested.

When I taking friends there, though, they were not particularly happy with the service, but I think it's pretty standard for this type of restaurant. Also, most of the food is cooked with quite a bit of oil so it's definitely high in calories.

Watch for specials in the local ValPak because you can also usually get a free side dish included."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! 

We had Chicha Morada (sweet purple corn drink), papa la huancaina (boiled potatoes covered in creamy and spicy  huancaina sauce) , seco (delicious beef and cilantro stew with rice) and lomo saltado (sauteed strip of sirloin, tomatoes, onions, fries and rice). 

I've grown up eating Peruvian food and think this place serves as a great substitution for the real deal (parents and grandma don't live here!) We usually get good service and the food has been consistently good. Honestly, I'm happy to see the improvements from the new owners and look forward to try the food when the new chef starts... exciting because we've already tried the new chef's food from an over-priced restaurant in San Diego and sad because we'll be going back home soon.

This place is definitely worth a try because you get a great meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was ok. I would order from some other place. 
Ordered orange chicken and General Tsao' s chicken - they looked the same. Orange chicken was bland and covered in a very thick sayce. The General's was dry and not spicy at all. The cream cheese ragoon were not edible.  The sweet and sour sauce is from a jar or a can. On the positive side, the wo ton were crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Asian food in Las Vegas. My favorite is the curry fried rice and red curry. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Chicken satay was breaded, pad Thai had no scallions or bean sprouts & was yellow- I would not even bother tasting it.. Not even the normal pad thai noodles, these looked like vermicelli. The server tried telling me those were the noodles all Thai restaurants in Vegas used, not what I remember from when I lived there & not what is used in the rest of this country. 
Will never be returning here."}
{"text":"Not far from the house I really wanted to try LD after seeing a flier.  So I popped in with the GF after seeing a movie thinking we could eat and chat about it..

With a few missed turn offs we finally located the place as it truly is tucked away and off the beaten path.  After walking in we were greeted but not in a warm and welcoming sort of way but rather in a stoic way.

I ordered up some Pad Thai and the GF ordered the Sesame Chicken.  The came out quickly and we began to eat.  The Pad Thai was fine but i did not really care for my GF's chicken.

I really wanted to like this place but instead I realized that maybe I don't live as close to it as I thought."}
{"text":"Finally a decent Chinese restaurant in N. Las Vegas!

Started with good atmosphere inside when we walked in.

Ordered bowl of Hot N Sour soup, looks like you could feed 6-8 with it.  Very tasty, not too spicy to cause hiccups, also ingredients tasted very fresh.  Had a little taste of sweet which was unique.

Next we ordered 2 dishes.  

Hong Kong Pan Fried Noodle w/ Vegetables.  Comes with Shrimp, Beef, Chicken & Pork covered in a very tasty brown sauce.  The vegetables in this dish were cooked to perfection.  Every other place I have been to, the zucchini are mushy and the broccoli are limp, but not here!  They had the perfect texture & bounce.  Also the meat was tender & each tasted as their own flavor instead of everything tasting like seafood.

Orange Chicken.  Very fresh and very crispy.  The sauce that came with it was reduced to an extremely thick glaze that worked very well with the crispy breading on this chicken.  A little went along way.  Also came with white steamed rice which was cooked nicely.

Due to the rest of the over cooked mediocre Chinese restaurants in the area, I am giving this one 5 stars.  Took me a while to work through the rest, now I have found the best in N. Las Vegas.  Thank you Little Dumplings!

Also noticed that during weekdays, they have lunch specials from 11am-4pm.  Making it even easier to try them out yourself."}
{"text":"Awful. New owners. Again. Each time a little worse. We had to update the review as a result. 
Prices have increased. Quality has diminished. This was our go to place. Not any more. We tried twice since the new family took over. We won't be back. 
Disgusting. 
The food is at best average. Not tasty. 
I'm so sad the first owners moved away. This WAS. My fav."}
{"text":"I ordered from this place several times. But every time it gets worst and worst. Last time it took them to deliver my food in almost 2 hours. And when I called the excuse was they were very busy. No more Mongolian beef from here."}
{"text":"Delicious made to order fresh and hot. Order the lunch special Mongolian beef, steAmed rice, veggie egg roll and a Thai tea boba. Great little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"It was a Thursday night. I was lamenting that there were NO good Chinese takeout/delivery places in Centennial Hills. I whipped out the ol' iPad and tried another search. Came upon Little Dumpling and was willing to try them. Their menu is now on my fridge for easy access!  Hubby ordered pepper steak and I got honey glazed walnut shrimp with a side of crab Rangoon.  He said his was good and believe me, he would have complained if it wasn't!  My shrimp was very good. Nice glaze. The crab rangoon was perhaps the best I've ever had.  Light and crispy, warm soft crab inside. Portions are generous for the price. We both had leftovers for lunch the next day.  I am so happy I found Little Dumpling - my new go-to place!  PS. They said it would take 45 minutes for delivery. They arrived in 35."}
{"text":"This review is all about the $5.95 lunch special.  Lunch is served from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.  

What do you get for that money?  Well, the lunch menu has over 50 dishes to choose from, that include two kinds of soup, choice of fried or white rice, choice of crab rangoon or a small egg roll, and refillable soft-drinks.  

I ordered the beef panang.  It's not the tastiest panang I've ever had, but referring back to the price for the whole meal, and the ample portion, I was pleased.  I had a decent portion of beef, mixed with carrots, onions, bell peppers and the panang sauce.  Mixed with a nice scoop of rice, I couldn't finish the meal.  My wife had Mongolian beef.  She complained that it wasn't spicy enough, and indicated that it was more like a teriyaki beef.  I think that if she asked them to spice it up, they'd be willing to put enough chiles and peppers to make her nose run.  

Concerning the overall environment and service, we were quickly seated upon arrival in a comfortable booth.  There was a plasma TV with CNN on the wall.  The service was prompt and attentive.  The place was quite clean and suitable for dining."}
{"text":"fantastic, we tried 5 items and they were all excellent. our appetizer was the pot stickers, then we all shared the house special lo mein, the general xaos, the sesame beef, and the chicken wraps. all yummy, cant wait to go again. the woman behind the counter was polite, friendly, and very helpful."}
{"text":"Dumpling is in their name and I didn't try one! Darn it... next time! I did try their Kung Pao Triple lunch special. For $6.25 I got a combination of beef, pork & shrimp along with fried rice and soup. Not bad! It tasted good too. I felt my wife got a bigger portion in her lunch special that was mere .30 less than mine but I had a nice combo of meats. I have eaten at another little Dumpling location across town and have no idea if they are connected but this location is much better. This is a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"eh this place wasnt to good but not terrible...basically another run of the mill thai/chinese restaurant but a weird twist....they had mexican hot sauce.....yea it was weird....."}
{"text":"Good food and fast service!

We've ordered from here several times. I have called and walked in to place my orders.  Actually walking in moved things along more quickly! The lady at the counter was very nice.  She was helpful and friendly.  

The dining area itself is always clean.  There is plenty of seating so no worries there.  The menu is quite extensive with varieties of Chinese as well as Thai options.  They offer delivery if you are within the 6 mile radius.

The food items that I've ordered have been very tasty.  The General Tso's Chicken is spicy and delicious.  The crab rangoons are always nicely filled.  There is always plenty to share with their generous portions.

I wouldn't hesitate coming back here for more when I have that Chinese food craving!"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh and hot! Has the best Thai tea in town! Love the appetizers and fried rice!"}
{"text":"Worst food I've had in awhile. China joes , chopstick are the way to go.  The kung pow was chewy and the paper wrapped chicken was flavorless.  Beef and broccoli was shit. worst 50 dollars Ive ever spent. I would have rather got a hooker for that 50 and caught an std."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try. It was ok, it didn't exceed expectations nor did it disappoint. the service could have been better considering when we got there, we were one of two parties there at the time (we had two people, the other had three) but it was ok. the lighting was very dark but I think is was a blown out bulb so easy fix. we got the family meal A. with egg fu yung and pad thai with bbq pork fried rice. The spring roll and cheese ragoon was pretty good. the spring roll had a nice light crunch and the veggies inside were tasty.  the cheese ragoon could have been a dessert but im not complaining it tasted like the filling of a cream cheese pie with a nice crunchy fried shell. the egg fun yung was different from what i had in the past and it was deconstructed.  the egg was just egg and onion and the rest (veggies and bbq pork) was just on top. The gravy could have used a little more salt and so could the eggs, the pad thai was ok. a little too sweet for my tastes and the sauce was very thin and didn't really stick to the noodles. The bbq pork fried rice was a little bland but very dark in color which was also a little different from what I have had in the past. I was happy I tried this place as I was not disappointed or surprised. I dont mind trying small hole in the wall places as it may be a hidden gem.... looks like I am still on the hunt."}
{"text":"I will give it 5 stars cause out of all the times I've ordered food from them maybe twice the food wasn't as great as it usually is, there has been times employees wasn't as bubbly as (most people) would like them to be, but in my opinion it was just an \"off day\" they were having. People are very quick to judge and don't even think twice to write businesses a bad review based on one or two visits. If people were as quick to go and write something nice as they are when they have a bad experience we definitely wouldnt see as many bad reviews as we do it on yelp.
I really enjoy this place and definitely I would keep going back."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant until the experience last night. There is a new Asian lady 40ish who was so rude and inconsiderate. I think she may be the owner as she was yelling at all the employees. I can not ever endorse or go into a place where people are rude to their employees. Sad that I can never go back but happy to get last nights horrible feeling off my chest. This rudeness literally ruined my wife and Is date night. No one is above anyone else."}
{"text":"Usually each mom and pop Chinese food restaurant has its own charm and unique \"personality\" of food, and I can usually appreciate the quality for what it is - Americanized Chinese food. I could not find something positive to comment on for Little Dumpling. 

The mint beef was way too salty. The beef was too chewy and tough. The appetizer eggroll was under cooked because the inside wrapper layer was still white. There was barely any filling inside, for there were only a few strands of veggies inside.  The egg flower soup tasted like canned chicken broth. 

Conclusion: I only went in there out of convenience and curiosity for a new lunch location and I came out disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pad thai food. Pricing is very good and most lunch specials are 5.00-6.00"}
{"text":"Went to Little Dumpling for dinner tonight with my fiance.  I ordered the orange chicken combo and she did the Mongolian beef combo.  We both had the egg flower soup, bbq pork fried rice, egg roll and fried wonton as part of the combo.  We both enjoyed our meals and the orange chicken was one of the better ones that I have had.  No issues with service they did a good job."}
{"text":"I'm such a cliché.  Eating Chinese food alone...*sigh*  Anytime you ever see someone at a restaurant eating alone, just remember it's me.  

Anyhoo, after being spammed by numerous flyers in my physical mailbox, I decided to venture to Little DUMPling.  I got in a hair before 4pm, so I was able to get the orange chicken lunch special and a drink for a little under $8.  It comes with egg drop soup and some wonton chips (dine-in only).  The chicken itself was very underwhelming.  I mean, I like plain foods, but this was TOO plain...I'm talking devoid of any taste at all.  Even when I drenched it in the sauce, I tasted nothing.  It hardly seems fair to rate a restaurant upon one item only, but I'm going with a 2 for now based on the orange chicken.  If I ever decide to return, I will update accordingly.

Lonely out~ (?)"}
{"text":"The family deal is a great choice!!!!  It can easily serve a family of four!  I like my kung pao chicken spicy, and the first time i had it here, it was lacking that kick.  The next time i asked if they could make it a little spicer, and boy did they!!!! It was WAY better, and i appreciated the fact that they did what i asked, and i will totally be back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I think of Little Dumpling, I automatically think of Jimmy Fallon's Thank You Notes. \"Thank you dumplings for tasting better than you sound\" Lol!

All jokes aside, I don't get the bad reviews here. I really like this place. The food is good and so is the service. I've dined in a few times, cute little restaurant and very clean, no complaints. But mostly I like to use the delivery service. You can pay online, even include the tip so when the food comes to your door all you have to do is grab your food and say thanks! :) I'll be honest, they do take a while to deliver but I'm sure 30 minutes seems like an eternity when you're starving. 

Everything I've tried so far has been good, but the General Tso's chicken is my absolute favorite. Get two orders so you can have left overs the next day. Nothing better than leftover Chinese food. Ummm."}
{"text":"So hungry, forgot to take a pic of the food!   The lunch special included the requisite egg roll, which was served fresh out of the fryer and fine. 

The hot and sour soup was filled with generous pieces of pork, bamboo shoots, and steamy spoonfuls of spicy flavorful broth.  Their chicken panang, in a lighter coconut milk based sauce, was offered with thin green beans, cut carrot slices, bamboo shoots, basil and again, a very generous amount of the most tender chicken breast slices ever!  I ate way more than I should have, but kept thinking I could figure out their chef's secret to the tender chicken by osmosis. I even asked, but the technique was not divulged. Don't blame them. 

Prompt, friendly service. Very inexpensive full lunch special plus iced tea was under $9.  Had a nice lunch, cool A/C location,  convenient to shopping and freeway."}
{"text":"Great food and great price, typically not too busy. Staff is friendly and attentive. We are frequent customers and never leave unsatisfied"}
{"text":"I'm pretty hard but I gave little dumpling 4 stars  because of their fried rice. I'm from the Midwest and we like our fried rice dark fried rice not white. So this restaurant does it up the right way in my opinion. The service is outstanding the staff is very nice the food is good and like I said earlier I love the fried rice."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price. They're service can be a bit off putting at times but it can be glossed over since it's literally a corner in the wall kind of place."}
{"text":"This was my initial order. The Pad Thai was very good although a little on the sweet-side. Next time, I'll order a different spice-level. The General Tso's was excellent. Portions were good. I will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Vegetarians: For me, it was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable lo mein and the Ma Po To Fu. Both were pretty good. It wasn't the best thing I ever ate, but I would definitely get the Veggie Lo Mein again. 

Meat-Eaters: My boyfriend got the orange chicken and the teryaki chicken. He liked the teryaki chicken. He said it was the BEST orange chicken he's ever eaten. He loves spicy food and he said the chicken tasted orange-y AND spicy. 

Our meals were served quickly, with smiles, AND with free fried wontons and (vegetarian :D ) egg rolls, with very yummy sweet and sour sauce!

The food is inexpensive. We ordered 4 entrées and it came to around $30. They serve food on styrofoam plates with plastic utensils, which I don't mind. You can either dine in, take out, or have delivery.

It is a small family-owned hole in the wall place. Turn into the Starbucks parking lot and it will be at the very end.

Overall, I am quite satisfied."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken for a pickup order.

 Both left much to be desired. The fried rice was good but the chicken was rubbery and chewy. Almost gristly. I pushed the majority of it to the side.... 

Got two free eggrolls for an over $10 order.... they were better than the \"chicken\"....

I asked the hubby if he'd order from them again and he said no. I have to say I agree. There's better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Egg drop soup and crab rangoons were run of the mill, but I never even got to try my favorite dish here because they sent the wrong entree for delivery.  Yellow curry and green curry are pretty different, especially at $25 for one person after delivery and tip.  Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"So f****** grossed out ...ordered crab ragoons and pad Thai with a thai tea for delivery and got some soggy fried shrimp crap no thai tea and the pad Thai was so old it was a solid brick of noodles when I got it...tried to break it apart and surprise surprise got a big ass hair with my noodles...NEVER ORDERING FROM THOS LOCATION AGAIN!!! I usually go to the n decatur one Wich is amazing....this place is absolutely disgusting"}
{"text":"I have only ever eaten at this location, but we have ordered from them about 10 times in the last 5 months. NEVER fails. I suggest you have 2 bottles of red wine and some great movies on hand and plan for a yummy night in.

We ordered last night and the man on the phone said that it may take about 45 minutes. He warned me of this before I ordered, and I find this respectable. I'll be damned if dude wasn't there in 42 minutes :)

Sesame and Orange Chicken are great. We get one of the 2 each time. Do the Egg Rolls, Spring Rolls are lame. The Chow Mien is perfect. You know how some places let the fat noddles stick together?? Not here, nope...

Also, they do not line the bottom of the containers with veggies, a deceptive trick many Asian delivery places pull.

Their bulk specials and family combos are excellent. Also, they include coupons with every delivery.

We will continue to order from here because they are reliable, consistent and very friendly."}
{"text":"Not going to have them any stars bad food order beef and broccoli and orange chicken and order some dumplings as well food was to fast nothing had any flavor at all the orange chicken had a sause that was too thick the beef broccoli was nasty would not recommend anyone to ever go there"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time because it was one of the few that was open on a Sunday. The food was good. . Just not the best I've tried. I got the Pad Thai and Tom Kha, both with chicken. Would probably try again just with beef or shrimp instead. The prices were very reasonable though."}
{"text":"Just the worst.  Walked in and the restaurant was completely quiet. The lady was sitting at the counter on her phone when I walked in, and greeted me with only a \"hi.\" Ordered food to-go at roughly 840-ish -  Egg drop soup,  veggie egg rolls, potstickers, and chicken panang curry - then immediately went home, which is 10 minutes away. 

Now, I'm normally not picky, but the food was terrible.  The egg drop soup and egg rolls tasted like any Asian restaurant egg drop soup and egg rolls. The potstickers was mediocre - the meat look questionable because it had some slight pink to it or it could be my eyes.  

Now, the chicken panang curry is the dish I was looking forward to. It looked decent,  had mostly veggies, some chicken, and the curry soup was somewhat watery, but tell me why ... it tasted like spoiled milk. I know most panang curry has coconut milk, but it tasted just like spoiled milk, and I'm now paying the price after several bites later ... on the toilet. 

I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"For a typical Chinese food place,Little Dumpling is great. I live 10 mins away for the last 2 years, and they have remained one of our favorite chinese delivery restaurants in Vegas. Sure, it's greasy Americanized Chinese food, but it's damn good! The owner is also extremely nice, and it takes no longer than 30 minutes on average for them to deliver your food."}
{"text":"My son and I know Chinese food.....being 4 months in....we finally found our Chinese food place.... Great food!!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since its opening several years ago.  With different friends and memories, each time this place has delivered as promised.  It's good, family-owned food that is certainly worth trying.  The prices are very reasonable, the service is excellent, and they have plenty of options to choose from.

Try the dumplings, steamed or fried.  They are the places namesake, and for their quality and cheap price I'd say they deserve it.

They also cook to order by telephone, so you can bring it back with you if you'd prefer.  It's been fun watching this place grow and become successful, and it isn't by luck."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is around where I work, so its kind of the last minute \"oh crap, who's supposed to buy lunch?\" type of days, this place is it!  Little Dumpling is pretty much it (hey, it sure as heck beats the typical fast food, burger type of joints)

They have great lunch specials, take out, delivery...Various items on the menu..thai and chinese mostly.

Their Thai Tea isnt bad, its good on a summer day! Dont get me wrong starbucks is around the corner, but I'd rather pay $2 for a big cup of tea vs $2 for a grande (and I love starbucks!). Its nice to know that good chinese place is around the corner from work"}
{"text":"Not as good as everyone says it is.  They use MSG and I feel sick from it.  I wouldn't be so harsh but folks, let's wake up as a whole and demand no MSG, it's a simple enough thing and I suppose we shouldn't support places that use it.  Admittedly, it's hidden in many foods.   (excerpt from MSGTRUTH DOT O R G)  CHICKEN and  SAUSAGE products,  RANCH dressing,  PARMESAN items, GRAVY, and DIPPING SAUCES and fries with any kind of seasoning on them except plain salt.  FLAVORED salty snack chips  - ESPECIALLY Doritos® and Cheetos® and items with cheese powder added.
At regular restaurants, you want to avoid  PARMESAN encrusted ANYTHING, SOUPS, CEASAR salad, FISH SAUCE or EXTRACT,  SOY SAUCE,  BOARS HEAD® COLD CUTS and beef jerky (usually made with soy sauce)  and anything that comes out of a can.  Go to restaurants that make things from scratch - you can ask what is in food and also ask for special items without the offending ingredients.  You WILL be glad you spoke up BEFORE you eat the wrong thing.  DON'T smother your choice in the parmesan cheese at the table either- Parmesan cheese is 1% straight MSG by weight.

As you can see, we're literally surrounded by the stuff.  But that's no reason to turn a blind eye, keep consuming, and \"hope\" everything will be OK.
Should be fine to eat here as long as the request \"NO MSG\" is made."}
{"text":"Bland food, slow service, and restaurant seemed a bit dirty. Only thing I liked was my boba drink."}
{"text":"Usually very fast and has very good lunch specials. Although, the food quality is pretty inconsistent and is average in taste. The service is always quick and accommodating."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really truly did. It's within walking distance of my house, and there's no cuisine I enjoy more than Chinese food.

None of that matters if the food you get isn't even fully cooked.

It doesn't taste great, but I can live with that. But not fully cooked? How the hell do they pass food safety inspections?

I've tried 6 different things at this place and all of them have been mediocre at best. The sugar in my almond shrimp last week wasn't even mixed in, I could feel it between my teeth as I was eating the food. Most people wouldn't come back to a place like that after that sort of thing but like I said, it's across the street and I love Chinese cuisine.

TL;DR: If it wasn't for the pink coloring I saw on my chicken, I'd give this place 3 stars. But given that I paid money for food I couldn't even eat without risking indigestion, this place deserves less than 1 star.


PS: I've lived in 3 states and 6 cities. I've had Chinese food from dozens of places, and this is the first time I've ever left a bad review. That should tell you something."}
{"text":"Been going here for over a year, and I've always come back for the great Chinese and Thai food. However I ordered (delivery, which took about an hour) an order of Fried Wontons (which were hard and cold), Thai iced tea (that was warm with a little ice in it,) and Pan Fried Noodles. I didn't have a problem with the noodles until I started eating and as I was thinking how tender the beef was I found a METAL STAPLE looking thing IN THE MEAT. It hurt my tooth even. Will never order here again sadly. : /"}
{"text":"Really dark. Very hard to see in this place. Funny part was every guest asked if they made sushi. Lol. Food was ok. I had the curry but it was more like a gravy and not curry sauce. Also had pad Thai which was good but way too too much sauce."}
{"text":"Ok we just had the food.. i ordered the dumplings and maybe because it was the end of the night they were very dry inside. The orange chicken was good . And fried wantons good rice good. Soup is ok... i love the idea that they have the Chinese cartons it reminds me of new york style , and they had crispy wide noodles which was yummy.. I will try it again at lunch time.. price was good..."}
{"text":"I was served dirty plates and the most awkward cup of green tea ever ( a plastic cup full of large leaves with a bit of hot water)...when I complained..of course no one spoke english. This place sucks.."}
{"text":"Save your money! This was the worst Thai food EVER! The Pad Thai tasted like noodles with ketchup dumped on them! A real disappointment! Horrible food!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. We stopped here because we had been shopping in the same shopping center. We ordered crab rangoon, Pad Thai with chicken, yellow curry with chicken and thai iced tea. First, they brought little slivers of wonton to the table and they were very stale. I didn't think much about it, until they brought out the crab rangoon. They looked great from the outside, but when I bit into one, I discovered a boiled egg?? What was that doing in there? Oh, and NO crab or scallions. It was the strangest crab rangoon. It was also a bright yellow inside with no cheese either. It didn't even taste good. I don't know what was going on. After that, my gf and I decided to just leave and we headed to eat better thai somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service! The women didn't know I spoke chinese and she was saying the rudest thing such as that I'm so cheap that I only ordered one drink for me and my boyfriend. Never ever comming here again!"}
{"text":"Having gone to some other Little Dumplings I was quite shocked when I walked in. The decor was very pretty, from the chandelier to the nice black booths. The staff was very friendly and attentive both times I've gone. My friend and I had ordered the dumplings appetizers and for the entree, she had ordeded chow fun while I had the Green Curry. Our food had come out in a timely manner and the food was good, the curry was flavorful and the rice was nice and fluffy. We had also ordered a pair of thai teas with our food which deserves a mention for it actually tasted like thai tea, not just thai tea flavored. 

We went again and ordered the honey walnut shrimp the fried shrimp was still crunchy (just like I like it) and had not been soaked in the sauce for hours.

To make everything better it's relatively cheap and very affordable. Quickly becoming one of my go-to places. My ONLY grievance would have to be the lack of a Dessert Menu, by that I mean they have nothing. Not too big of a deal since there are places nearby if you're craving a sweet afterward but it would be nice if something was added"}
{"text":"Good food, fast and easy for kids. Best hot and sour soup. I recommend this place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The most horrible food ever. Tried first time yesterday, and im never going back. I dont usually go write reviews but i dont want anyone to be fooled. Order kung pao shrimp, garlic shrimp and one more shrimp dish in coconut creme, i just took 3 bites and was done . Worst food ever i tasted from the north las vegas takeaways"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Sesame Chicken tasted bland and there was nothing special about their food at all."}
{"text":"Worst christmas eve dinner ever.  Teriyaki chicken horrible.  Then when i brought it back they woyld not give me a refund.  Steer clear of this restaurant no customer service."}
{"text":"Great Chinese in the NW part of Las Vegas. Gf loves the Pad Thai and I love their general tso and orange chicken."}
{"text":"First of all, I LOVE this restaurant.  It's tiny, casual... but best of all, the food and service are always amazing.  Every time I eat there, the same lady and cook are there (I'm assuming she is the owner, but I'm not sure.)  She is always friendly and serves us like it is a sit down restaurant!  My favorite is the orange chicken and pork fried rice.  The orange chicken is the best I've ever had.  The sauce has a hint of orange zest in it that is very distinct.  Soooo good and nothing like fast food Chinese take out. You also get a lot of food for little money.  Lunch is usually $5 and includes the entree, fried rice, soup and an egg roll.  Yum!  They also deliver for a $1 charge if you are nearby."}
{"text":"Yum!  Everything we've tried here is delicious. It's prob our fave little local Chinese food store."}
{"text":"I asked if they could make the orange chicken spicy.   Yes she said. I said ok I want it extra spicy. Ok she said. She lied. It was sweet and must have been made hours earlier. The egg drop soup was good. Are there any good Chinese restaurants in the SW??"}
{"text":"Great customer service. Taste of food was good. Salt & Pepper Chicken was greasy & dark. Must drain oil before serving & use fresh oil."}
{"text":"Delicious pad-tai. Crispy and not chewy sesame chicken. 
If you are planning on dining in you better not have a large party because the place is as big as a 1 bedroom apartment. SUPER TINY. 
More expensive than China a Go Go. The price and small dining area is why I didn't rate 5 stars. 
This place is routinely confused with the Little Dumpling on Decatur...beware."}
{"text":"Consistently amazing sesame chicken! It is crispy and caramelized on the outside with soft non-chewy chicken inside. Reminded me of NY! Use the online order app to get two free spring rolls (one time use promo) or a free order of fried rice for any order over $30. 

It's way more expensive than China a Go Go. The price is why I didn't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"good for lunch, delivery  take out.  varied menu (thai, chines, and dumplings)"}
{"text":"Really consistent Chinese food. Prices are reasonable, and the service is pretty fast. Teo minutes away and worth it."}
{"text":"Yummy tofu pad thai! A lot better than most other delivery thai options!"}
{"text":"This is my new Chinese restaurant!

Love coupons an they have tons, second I love ordering online. It's so much easier and their website is simple and easy.

The orange chicken was great but I personal thought they put too much sauce. The pork fried rice was to die for. Tasty, full of meat an flavored to die for. White rice was... Normal? Next we got the wontons. Crispy fried meat filled goodness. 

Can't wait to get some more soon!"}
{"text":"Bad reviews had me want to test the place and i was so glad I did?The food was amazing?fresh and delicous? Overall? I would 100% come back? The pad thai was amazing? along with the Sesame chicken?and the crab rangoon? These are the best crab rangoon ever?"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite lunch spots! You can not beat their lunch special price of $6.50 a entree. With the special you get a veggie fried spring roll, your choice or sweet and sour or egg drop soup and an entree of your choice. Service is very attentive and food is flavorful. I enjoyed the pad Thai with beef and it came with a mix of green and sweet onions, crushed peanuts, and a lime wedge to squeeze on top. This is not the fanciest of places and the presentation was lacking but you cannot beat their prices for the quality and flavor of their dishes. I definitely recommend making this your next lunch spot!!!"}
{"text":"Being the only place that serves Thai in the area I was hoping I had found a nearby place for my Thai fix. Well this place won't be it for me. I went with several friends and we all got something different to share. 

To the food. The Panang Curry was watered down and lacked flavor, it was a shadow of the true Panang Curry I've had everywhere else. Next the Pad See Oew... Or what they called Pad See Oew. The noddles were floating in liquid. The noodles were rubberish and it was all very bland. The Pad Thai... Hard to mess this one up right...wrong. First it came out looking neon orange which is no big deal as long as it taste good which it didn't. We got it at spice level 7/10 which I do everywhere. The heat level was good but it wasn't heat with flavor but just all over your mouth heat with the bland noodles. On to the fourth bad dish, the Lo Mein noodles. The noodles tasted stale and lacked any flavor what so ever. The one good item we ordered was the garlic chicken. Nothing special about it but it was good."}
{"text":"My family was hungry after spending the morning at the Orchard. We figured Target down the road would have some fastfood within its compound. So we found this little asian place. Yelp reviews was not that good but we were hungry so we took the risk.

We ordered - fisherman's delight, and two lunch specials the pad see ew and orange chicken. We also ordered milk tea boba and a fountain drink.

Food is affordable. Each serving size were good for at least two people. The hot & sour soup and egg drop soup that came with the lunch specials were excellent. The rest of the meal were pretty tasty too. It was a pleasant surprise.

What's even better is that for orders $15 or more you get 1 free thai tea. Sweet!

We'll definitely eat here again when we go back to the Orchard next year."}
{"text":"Sad to see the bad reviews cuz I've never had bad food here and ordered delivery 6x.
Now as with all delivery-sometimes they're are little issues, but the food has always been good, hot and delivered fast.
Chinese is a matter of taste-try it, I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"I'm a bit confused with some of the reviews as I've ordered delivery at least 5 times and even picked up twice with no incident.
The food is always good, hot and fresh.
The delivery is one of the fastest I've ever had (one time they did forget an item but offered to bring it back-I didn't take them up on it).
This is a small take our place not Mr. Chow and I've tried so many who end up on dirty dining or close.
A lot of the reviews say they are rude, I've never experienced this....maybe their English is not that good?
Chinese food differs no matter where you are-San Fran, Chicago, NYC-you just have to try it yourself to really know if you like it or not.
Me-I like Little Dumpling."}
{"text":"Since moving to the area about six months ago, we have ordered delivery from Little Dumpling approximately seven or eight times. What's sad is that sometimes it's delicious, but other times it's not. They definitely have a consistency problem. Sometimes it's flavorful, spicy, fresh and wonderful. Other times it's bland, stale and cold. 
I hope they find their weak link and take care of it because we love having them so close for nights when I don't feel like cooking or don't have time."}
{"text":"Good fried rice. Ordered the shrimp fried rice. 
Other items ordered; teriyaki chicken, I liked it, others did not. The teriyaki is a bit strong but the chicken is very tender and plentiful.
Ordered #7 ribs, tasted good but overcooked and hard to eat with little meat on them. No one ate them although we all tried them. 
Fast delivery. Wanted to end on a positive note."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of Little Dumpling for years, and I typically order take out. I love the Chicken Pad Thai and Crab Rangoon! Its well spiced with chili oil and generous with the meat. Delivery is fast, and has friendly drivers. My gf likes the Lemon Chicken with sauce on the side and eggroll for starter. It's our local Chinese go to, give it a try...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This little place has amazing food. Frist all vegetables are fresh. No frozen or canned peas or canned mushrooms. That is a plus for any veggy enthusiasts. 

The  Crab Rangoons are served with a chilli sauce which only adds to the spice inside the rangoon. 

Servings are large and filling. The Egg Foo Yung is the BEST I have tasted anywhere in Las Vegas. The Eggplant Delight is a wonder! Thick pieces of Eggplant and vegetables.

Lastly, the service is attentive and sincere. If you aren't eating here you are missing out."}
{"text":"I have never been a big fan of Chinese food..but i have to say this wasn't bad...the fried rice was great and my sweet and sour shrimp was good....the crab Rangoon ehhh not so great.... IF i have a craving for Chinese again i will try again"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly, but flavorless. Beef and broccoli was tender but had the flavor of water"}
{"text":"I have nothing good to say about food. Ribs were all fat. Broccoli tasted like rotten fish. Fried rice very bland. Curry tasted  like white gravy.
Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Service, staff, and atmosphere is very nice. Clean and stylish. We got the Family Meal C which included really great appetizers and a spicy shrimp soup. The entrees were pineapple fried rice, pad Thai, and yellow curry. Everything tasted great, EXCEPT: I came here because I was craving yellow curry specifically. What came to us was not yellow and definitely not curry. It had a pasty, jelly consistency and tasted so very bland. Nowhere even near curry-- I asked if they made a different version and was told no, not really. I wanted to give 2 stars for that disappointment but ended up giving 3 because everything else was good. Just stay away from curry."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order some chicken pad Thai for pick up and in 20 minutes I was at the restaurant and it was ready at the front. It was an easy transaction to pay and leave but the lady wasn't very friendly and seemed annoyed she had to help a customer. When I got home and began to eat, i found the noodles were spicier than what I ordered (mild) and it had an ok flavor. Too much cabbage and carrots were on top and not nearly enough bean sprouts. I've been on a Thai kick lately and this place has been the worst of the bunch."}
{"text":"4 stars?! For this place? Yes. I love chinese food and there are only a few places we get our chinese food. Grand China? Gross, it gave my sister food poisoning and the food was not that great at all. The other little dumpling on decatur is just too oily for me.

This chinese place, gives the right amount of food and the right amount of deliciousness each time we come here. We always get the lunch specials. Comes with soup and your entry. The noodle dishes don't come with fried rice though, but nonetheless you still get a lot of food for $5.95! Whatever dish we order or try, it always comes out delicious. I'm a sucker for their pad thai. Their chow mein is always so good too. Honey walnut shrimp is a must once and awhile because it is just, yummy!! Also their sweet and sour pork is what got me hooked to this place.

This place is also always so clean, people complain about the smell when they walk in. I've gotten used to it. But it is clean and you can sit anywhere. At least when they get health inspections, they always pass. Grand china always fails their health inspections. I wonder why? 

I also come here to get their taro boba. I love boba and theirs is just sweet and the boba is nice and chewy. Sometimes it can be a little 'too' sweet, so you might ask for less sweetness if you'd like. 

I only give 5 stars to places, I really like and enjoy. This place, I really like and enjoy. The decor can be updated, but its okay. I go there for the food and friendly servers. The server there, her name is Liz. She is always so sweet and gets your order out as soon as its done! She is very friendly and she knows my family very well when it comes to what we order. This will always be our go to place for chinese food. My family will never order from anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the best meals I have ever had.

Imagine this:  4 p.m. local time, family of four has just arrived in town from East Coast.  Husband, wife, and two jet-lagged little kids are looking for somewhere, anywhere to eat an early dinner while driving through the suburban hell that is outer Vegas.  Seriously, there's got to be a good place to eat, but who can tell where to find it among the non-descript strip malls and chain restaurants?  Chinese is usually reliable, right?  Okay, so let's stop at this Little Dumpling place.

Pull into especially dingy-looking shopping strip.  Husband notices that this is actually Peruvian-Chinese fusion, not just regular Chinese.  He takes the gamble and says the place is probably good.  Wife is too sleep-deprived and hungry to put up a fight.  Looking back, is she ever glad that she let herself get talked into this place.

Apparently, there was a Chinese population that ended up in Peru sometime after WWII, and as happens pretty much anywhere Chinese people immigrate, they created a fusion cuisine.  As we have \"American Chinese,\" the Peruvians have \"Peruvian Chinese.\"  American Chinese isn't authentic Chinese, but it can be very, very good, so I was open-minded.  

We started with an order of Yuca a la Huancaina, fried strips of yucca (cassava) topped in a very slightly spicy bright-yellow sauce.  The host/waiter/owner's son told me that the sauce was made with peppers and was dairy based, but I'm pretty sure it's also got egg yolks in it.  Either way, it's absolutely heavenly.  

We also ordered the Tallarin Chino, or Chinese noodles, topped with vegetables (these are usually made with meat, but they accommodated us).  They're served with a gingery, garlicky black bean sauce and taste much like mei fun or lo mein or those squiggly thin egg noodles that you sometimes get in Thai restaurants.  We also ordered Pescado a lo Macho, which is supposed to be very spicy, but which they made mild for us.  It's a crispy-fried fillet of bass that is served with a tomato-pepper sauce thickened with cornstarch.  Also delicious.

Loved the place so much that we went back a week and a half later, just as we were ready to leave town.  I especially love their desserts.  The best was the alfajores, sandwiched butter cookies with a dulce de leche filling.

Also, the Chicha Morada is not to be missed.  It's traditional Peruvian style punch, made with blue corn, pineapple juice, lime juice, and a few other ingredients and is delicious and refreshing.  I believe the traditional way to make this drink is alcoholic, but this version is not."}
{"text":"I love this place. I had a friend tell me about it 5 years ago. It is a hole in the wall for sure but those are the best and this place hold true to that. They have a similar menu to China a go go but their flavor is so much better. One night I got China a go go and the next night I got little dumpling and there was no comparison. I have ordered from this place countless times and only had 2 times where they messed our order and it wasnt even major, one time I remember they for got 2 egg rolls. Another major plus is they are really fast."}
{"text":"I order from this restaurant all the time and have it delivered. Their Singapore noodles, basil chicken and Tom Ka soup are to die for"}
{"text":"General Tso Chicken was slimey. Egg flower soup was slimey. Fried rice was okay, definitely never coming back."}
{"text":"Food is decent but the place needs to staff up to handle the rather brisk takeout business. Tables around us were left dirty, entrees were delivered several minutes apart, and our waiter was very distracted by the phone orders he had to take.

Again, the food is good but the dining room service was awful."}
{"text":"I started going when Little Dumplings first moved around thee years ago.  It was a five star takeout then.  Now, the person on the phone doesn't speak English well enough to get an order right.  (in training)  The breaded dishes (all of them) have more breading than meat and some of it is not edible at all.  The egg rolls are vegetable only with no alternatives and really, they aren't egg rolls, they are a poor version of a spring roll.  This last time we ordered (2/13/15) the food was very salty as well.  The good are the portion size which is large, the quality of the meat they put in each dish is better than you would expect and overall they make tasty food, if somewhat salty.  We have never gotten takeout from anywhere else but after this last experience we are going to try others."}
{"text":"I order the orange chicken and it was very nasty I never going back to little dumpling. I called to tell them and she said \"i'm not dealing with this\" and hung up!!!! What terrible customer service."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for this place me and my roommate decided to stop by for lunch. The lunch specials are priced very nicely (6 bucks) and the portions are filling. The service was choppy but the woman had her hands full with her baby girl. I would come back."}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch with my husband and son. They served us pretty quick. Our servers were very nice and friendly. The chef also came and greeted us and check to see if we were ok. The food tasted ok. Not horrible at all for the price we paid. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love their Thai Curry flavored pineapple rasin Fried rice with shrimp, chicke, tender beef with lime & basil !!! mmmmmmmmm i can eat that everyday!!! also Lage Wonton soup comes with fried crunchy wonton there is soooooooo yummmy oishi ono!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the beef teriyaki bowl and the meat was so chewy I could even bite threw the meat I tried to swallow it and almost choked so I had to eat my teriyaki bowl with out the meat total waste of money. I will say the egg roles were the best thing I ordered from them. The customer service was pretty sad I asked if they had a few things the lady rushed me. Plus they sent the wrong soup I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Not a ton of flavor. Little to oily for my taste but super convenient location. Staff was friendly. All in all OK for a \"I don't wanna cook\" kind of night."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars because the food is great, I'll be honest. BUT, this place has the worst customer service. They messed up my order when I asked for beef Hong Kong noodles, they gave me the shrimp Hong Kong noodles. I called them back and told them they gave me the wrong thing and she yelled at me saying \"No! That's what you ordered!\" And I don't eat seafood at all, so it's 100% false Id never in my life order seafood. And I told her that, then she cursed at me and said \"oh sh*t\" and then proceeded to say \"okay we'll come back\" and they fixed it. The food is good, they're just really unprofessional when you call them and they make you feel super rushed to order. They're always messing up when my family orders as well. If you do order from here, make sure it's 100% clear what you're getting from them."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food in Vegas and I'm from New Jersey. Which has the best Chinese food that and NY"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!

I have been ordering from this place for a while but the staff is always rude. TODAY THE MANAGER WAS BEYOND RUDE! FIRST SHE HUNG UP ON ME BECAUSE THEY MISSED APART OF MY ORDER like that's my part. Then when the driver came to the door he saw my mom and was like \"fuckkkkk\" he demanded a tip, then I told him there was no sauce in my bag , said idk I'm just the driver your calling me why?\" I called the manager told her what the issue was she told me to pay for delivery again or nothing. No refund nothing SOB!!! I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN! I found two pieces of HAIR IN MY FOOD ALSO!!! Disgusting place, disgusting service by disgusting people! I would give them 0 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER AGAIN ONLY ORDER IF YOU WANT HAIR, RUDE SOB HANGING UP ON YOU AND F'ING UP YOUR ORDER AND NOT TAKING OWNERSHIP!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, fast and friendly service and clean...what more could you ask?  I ordered the lunch Kung Pao Beef (how do they make the beef so tender?) and Wonton Soup and ate in.  I walked out about 25 minutes later and $8 lighter (including tip).   I'll be back.  Cheers, Nit Picky"}
{"text":"Omg. The inconsistency. The egg rolls go from stellar to about to turn to crispy to a lava flow of grease running down my arm. Tom kha delivered in a styrofoam container creates tom kha that tastes like styrofoam. The amount of meat in any dish varies tremendously. Oh and the last time I checked they're closed on Tuesdays. No. Just no. The delivery guy is sometimes lightning fast. Like, it's weird. It's not enough to keep me placing orders with them, though."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service..The lady who took my order was rude , I will never go back !! Trust me spend your money somewhere else .."}
{"text":"It was the first time we ordered from here. The food was really good and I like that they deliver."}
{"text":"Perhaps the saddest Thai I've had in a while.

Ambiance: B+. Small dining area. 
Bathrooms: C-. Grimy light switches, soap dispensers and floors. Toilet paper on the floor. At least there was paper towels and soap. 
Service: B+.  Fast and friendly enough. Accommodating. 
Food: D+/C-. Panang curry was flavorless -- could barely taste the curry.  The beef is that over tenderized rubbery stuff they put in any of their beef dishes. The pad thai was sad and tastes like ketchup sauce and rice noodles. There were maybe 5 shrimp in there.  The pineapple fried rice was mostly rice and had a few pieces of chicken and egg in it. No other vegetables other than the stray water chestnut.  It had more curry flavor than the panang. Salt and pepper wings tasted good. 
Value: C."}
{"text":"My sister and I usually go to the Little Dumpling on Sky Pointe and we have loved their food, especially the fried tofu. We thought to try the other one on N. Decatur. 
The restaurant was nice, clean and a friendly host greeted us. We ordered the Mongolian Beef & Almond Chicken dinner along with an order of fried pork potstickers. The corn flower soup was delicious. Our main entree came. The vegetable spring rolls were mushy and a bit undercooked. The potstickers tasted like they used maple sausage. My almond chicken, the sauce was good but the chicken was as white as the plate and very mushy. It seemed that they used canned chicken. My sister's Mongolian Beef had too much onions and very little meat. The fried rice came soaked in soy sauce. 
We won't be going back to that one. We will stick to the Sky Pointe one."}
{"text":"This place has good food. The delivery can sometimes get a little slow but that may just be them being busy. While we live closer to the grand china on Durango, we'll go out of our way to get food from little dumpling.  If you are a person that never adds salt to your food, this place will be right on the edge of being too salty, but overall, the food is very good."}
{"text":"The rice was dry, as if reheated. We ordered the appetizer platter, the chicken was very very dry. The BBQ pork was good, but that's pre-made so you can't screw it up."}
{"text":"Veggie Spring Rolls were mushy on the inside to the point where they had the consistency of a bean burrito. The Spicy Garlic Chicken wasn't inedible but it wasn't good. I had a piece of chicken that came with bone and fat attached to it. The Basil and Mint Beef was mainly bell peppers, it came with hardly any beef. 

The staff was okay. Attentive but nothing extraordinary. One employee accidentally charged a guy $85 on accident while we were here. I'm not sure if the lady that was working was an owner or manager or what but she brought her two kids in that kept walking around at first. 

The overall food quality was poor. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"It was long ago, and far away, when I first tried Chifa (read: Chinese-Peruvian food). Then, it was prepared by a loving mother of one of my closest girls and we couldn't wait to go over to her house when we knew her mom was making some of her famous food. 

Flash-forward to Peru, where I had a chance to go to authentic Chifa restos and enjoy this culinary blend of two otherwise different cultures. In one word: Yum! 

So, when I found Little Dumpling prided itself on its Chifa in Las Vegas, I couldn't wait to try it! The Aguado de Camarones (a cilantro based soup with loads of goodies); the Papas a la Huancaina (potatoes with an egg/cheese sauce smothered on top - to add a spicy kick, try these folks' homemade spicy cilantro sauce); and the steamed fish were excellent. Not so great: the seafood fried rice (the seafood in the rice was deep-fried so that this dish tasted heavy and very oily). All in all, an excellent meal in a cozy, no frills environment. And, yes, they serve Inka Cola. Love it."}
{"text":"We have ordered delivery from Little Dumpling quite a bit when we lived in Vegas. It was always fresh and delicious. 

We typically order a combination/family dinner (beef with broccoli and sweet and sour chicken) with appetizers, soup, fried won tons, etc. The food is great!"}
{"text":"One of the best affordable Thai/Chinese Restaurant in North Las Vegas.

Whenever I get a craving for some *shrimp pad thai*, I always find myself at Little Dumpling, over by 215 and N. Decatur. Their lunch specials is like $6 that comes with Fried or steam rice, egg drop soup, a huge basket of fried wontons, and crab rangoons and a choice of one of their many entrees, which includes but not limited to Pad Thai. 

My daughter and I ate here for lunch special and I had the Pad Thai lunch special with egg drop soup, and egg rolls. She had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice, crab rangoon and egg drop soup. I also ordered a 3rd lunch special, eventhough I am only 1 person, but I figured what the heck? It's only $6 bucks and I get to try their chicken eggplant in garlic sauce... it was yummy!!

Overall, this place is \"A\" in my book... Good job and keep up the good service =)"}
{"text":"I drive from the other end of Stephanie for the lunch specials. Probably once a week. 

I have several favorites, but steered clear of the too often clichéd Mongolian beef. I tried it recently and was surprised by the complexity. I think it is my current favorite. 

I was thinking, what if they tried a new family meal deal C for a while to see if it catches on. My idea is to do one without soup because laowai (gringos) don't really know what to do with takeout soup. I wonder if it would be a hit. Maybe worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a great little restaurant.  Their lunch specials between 12 and 2 pm can't be beat.  The food is plentiful & delicious.  This is the only local Chinese restaurant I have found with moo goo gai pan on the lunch menu."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout last night and I was really hoping it would be great because it's so close to home, but much to my dismay, the food was less than mediocre.  

I ordered the mongolian beef and there was way too much green onion.  The egg flower soup was okay.  The orange chicken had too much breading, not enough chicken.  The chow mein was bland.  

I'd probably order from them again if I'm too lazy to drive far for asian food."}
{"text":"Delivery is prompt and the drivers are always very pleasant. It's not the best Chinese food I've ever had, but it will do for a cheap dinner, especially with all the coupons they offer when you order online. They also give you A LOT of food. I've never finished my meal in one sitting, and it heats up well enough. I recommend the sesame chicken or the shrimp lo mein."}
{"text":"This place used to be our first choice for Chinese delivery. Over the past few months they started using lower quality ingredients and we were turned off. I can make most of their tropes at home so it's just not worth it."}
{"text":"Super dirty. Bathroom most disgusting thing I've seen in a place that serves food. We ate there all the time but after seeing the bathroom today, we will never be back."}
{"text":"YUMMMY !! This place is a hidden gold mine!Had Szechuan beef , and the guy made it special for me cuz HATE onions and gross peppers! I could not believe the portion size! No way I could I eat all in one sitting!"}
{"text":"I tried to order a simple lunch for myself and my coworker, and then mayhem happened! As I tried to explain how to get to my specific building in my complex, I was rudely interrupted and told that that was too much for them to write down and they would have the driver call me when he arrived. 

Then when I was asking about lunch specials I was also interrupted and told that the website and the prices in-store are completely different. When I tried to explain that the website said otherwise, the woman on the phone YELLED at me saying \"THAT'S NOT OUR WEBSITE!\" when I had gotten their phone number from the website that I was on. So obviously they false advertise. 

Then if things couldn't get any worse she told me that I needed to be put on hold because there was another customer in store that they needed to help and that they would call me back. It was honestly the most unprofessional phone encounter that I have ever experience. It didn't help that the phone was passed around to 3 different people who didn't speak very good English.

Overall this was a horrible experience and I didn't even order anything. Rudest restaurant I have ever called."}
{"text":"Ordered online for delivery and it took one hour and 45 minutes. The Buddhas delight had no tofu in it, and the brown sauce leaked all over the inside of the bag and over the other food. The food is good but the service could be much better."}
{"text":"Since moving from New York over 20 years ago we are constantly searching for comparable Chinese Food to what we were used to.  Little Dumpling comes pretty close.  When we walked in we were the only ones in the restaurant and we were a little skeptical but when we were leaving there were no empty tables.  The portions are quite large (we took home enough for another dinner).  The service was very attentive.  We ordered the Wor Wonton Soup which had plenty of the various meats, won tons and vegetables.  The broth from the soup was delicious.  We ordered the shrimp dumplings which apparently is a special because it is not even on the menu.  There were 8 steamed dumplings and they were very light and tasty.  My husband and I shared the House Fried Rice and the Scallops in Szechuan Sauce.  The fried rice had more than enough chicken, pork and the shrimp were not the usual tiny ones that they use for fried rice but the same size as they use in their shrimp dishes.  Before ordering the scallops I asked the waiter what size they were because we do not like large sea scallops.  He said they were small in size and when the dish came out it had bay scallops which are the size we love."}
{"text":"Not impressed. 
Best part of Cashew Chicken is the cashews.
Sesame chicken and sweet & sour pork tasted nearly the same.
Cold noodles and cold dumplings
Duck was full of bones.
Sauce for duck was done sort of reduction ( not plum sauce) PF CHANGS is 10 times better.
satay chic curry stick appetizer are comparable to chicken on a stick with curry powder no flavor. 
The peanut sauce worst ever. Tasted like plain old peanuts would have been tastier if I whipped out a jar of Peter Pan. 
Will not eat from this establishment again
Lobby is dingy, dirty lack of care
Boba tea was very bland. All around yuck.
Over priced .... Bad taste"}
{"text":"This place could be great, really.  Unfortunately the place as rather unattractive, the decor was sparse and forgettable, the only sounds were the people talking and the annoying television, and the waitress was shy, not very talkative, and wasn't great at helping you decide what to get.

The menu is rough-looking, has nothing to describe the food at all, and doesn't really appeal to a first-timer for Peruvian food.  It lacks the polish of a good restaurant, really.  

The food, you ask?  Decent.  The food on the menu is just a bunch of names, and how those names relate to the food at all is a mystery to the uninformed, so you have to ask your server.  As I stated earlier, the server has not forthcoming with explanations, so you had to just pick whatever you thought sounded nice.  The Chinese is lackluster and in fact a little more pricey than other Chinese-only places.  Don't come here for that.  The Peruvian food has more character, but even so, it's so hit-or-miss that it's not even worth the time and effort.

Suggestions for improvement?  They need to put a bit more capital into the decor, take the TV out of there, lower the amount of light and get indirect lighting.  Drop the Chinese completely, and change the name to an exotic, Peruvian-sounding name.  Play to your uniqueness, and you'll get much better attention.  If you feel you must have Chinese food there, due to Chinese immigrant influence on Peru's cuisine, then add it as \"Asian-Influenced\" or something to the otherwise Peruvian menu.  Add some photos of the dishes, as well as a description for each and every item.  For a non-Spanish speaker, the food on the menu might as well have been gibberish.

This could've been great, but as it stands, it's kind of dismal and not worth your time."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! And amazing food. I was very hesitant at first because I don't like Chinese food that much, but the food here is wonderful! And the server was super sweet and very understand because I was confused as to what I wanted. I definitely give this place a five star!"}
{"text":"Little Dumpling is one of my favorite place when it comes to Chinese and Thai food.  

Located off 215 and North Decatur, it's a small place that packs a big punch.  Despite the fact that it is in a small place, it looks very well decorated inside.  Enough room to dine in or order to go.  Living about 2 minutes away from the place, I do find this very convenient.  They do deliver, but the fact that we only live 2 minutes away, might be kind of pointless for them to deliver when we can go pick it up after 10-15 minutes.  

Usually I would order my Pad Thai and the wife will order her sweet and sour pork and pork fried rice.  Which I think taste really good and the wife likes it better than other Chinese restaurant.  I think portion is very good size and it always tend to fill me up. 

Overall, the food taste very good.  If you ever get a chance to go and dine, you'll be impress with the inside more than the outside.  Customer service is very nice and friendly.  I would really recommend this place if you're in the area.  I kin"}
{"text":"Never Again... Thought I'd give this place a try, after an 1 1/2 hours I call to check the status. I'm told he should be here any minute. Another 25 minutes go by.... Still nothing. I call back, then I'm told our food was in a bag no one seen. It's now been 15 minutes after that and there's still no food. While I can't say how the food is although I assume cold since it's been over 2 hours, I can say I will never order from here again."}
{"text":"This might have been the worst Thai food I've ever eaten. I thought I'd be safe by ordering a salad and satay chicken delivery. I literally took one bite of chicken spit it out and threw the whole thing away. I would not recommend the Thai - haven't tried the Chinese dishes definitely won't"}
{"text":"Great family owned Chinese restaurant at a very affordable price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food and fairly quick with deliveries. I love their NY Shrimp Rolls and their Won Ton Soup is really really good"}
{"text":"This is a curious restaurant that serves both Chinese and Thai Cuisine. I ordered Yellow Curry with rice. They gave me ample serving as I could only finish half and took the remainder home. The food was good but not excellent. 

The comments about the wait staff appear to be valid. When I entered the restaurant there was only one table with patrons. After a significant delay the waitress eventually showed up at my table for a drink order and to deliver the menu. The waitress then disappeared and after about 10 minutes some guy in a ball cap came out and took my entre order. The waitress reappeared later to deliver my entre and offer a drink refill. 

If you are looking for something to fill you up this might be the place for you. As I mention earlier the food is good but not great."}
{"text":"I happened to be on this side of town visiting my sister this evening and we decided to order from this place because they enjoy it. 

We actually ordered from here once before when we were visiting her as well.

We ordered a variety of food. All of it was good except the spare ribs. Those went right to the trash. Mostly just bone and gristle on them.

Everything else was good and they were fast."}
{"text":"If I'm being honest, I've never ordered food from this place. But their honeydew slush is TO DIE FOR!!! It's so amazing! My biggest regret is that I didn't find this place sooner. I'm not a boba fan, although the last time I stopped by, I tried it. NOPE, still not a fan, but the slush was so yummy!! Tastes just like honeydew ice cream in Japan or the honeydew bars they have in Korea... yummy! I'm so glad I don't have to drive all the way down to Spring Mountain to get a taste of this yummy slush! I will become a regular here for this slush alone! Plus it's so cheap! Just try it!"}
{"text":"This was my forth or fifth time eating here and tonight was not a good night and I will not be eating here anymore. The BBQ pork was over cooked and hard to chew. I had to throw it away. The house rice had huge chunks of chicken and 5 pieces of shrimp and that was all that was in the house fried rice. It was good before this and I thought I had a place to go to eat chinese food close to my house, but I was wrong. It is hard to find good chinese food here in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Low quality and boring food.   I will not be back."}
{"text":"My favorite local Chinese/Thai food place in the Centennial Hills area. I switch what I get each time and go back and fourth between the chicken pad Thai and the orange chicken. The lunch portions are very generous and I always have quite a bit of leftovers. The fried rice is always delicious with the orange chicken. The lunch special comes with the entree, white or fried rice, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce and your choice of sweet and sour soup or egg flour soup. (both are great but my favorite is the egg flower) I've been coming here for about two years now and haven't been disappointed with anything I've ordered."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery and got the Family Dinner B with shrimp in lobster sauce, pepper beef, bbq pork fried rice, steamed rice and it came with 2 egg rolls, 2 crab rangoons, 2 fried shrimp and wonton soup for $26.95 which I thought was a good deal. The food was good, not excellent. Not a lot of shrimp in the shrimp & lobster sauce, mostly on top rather than mixed in. The crab rangoons were very good and we received 4 free. My only major complaint would be that the wonton soup has entirely too much cabbage in it. I would say half of the container was just chunks of cabbage. Other than that delivery was relatively quick and it was good enough to order from again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. 
Service was great, food was great, & the price is great!

Went in for the lunch special and got the Chicken chow mein. It came with a soup, egg roll, and your choice of white or fried rice. I got a drink and upgraded my soup to the Wonton soup and ended up spending about $7.50! I left happy and full & still have left overs.
Went to the place Kobe next store yesterday and had the opposite experience. Spent $22 sad, hungry, and terrible service!"}
{"text":"We have ordered three times for takeout from Little Dumpling. The food is always very tasty and the portions are large. We always have hot and sour soup, sesame chicken and vegetable fried rice. We are always satisfied with the food. They have an online order system that is convenient also. A nice local Asian restaurant. We will defiantly be back when we crave Asian food!"}
{"text":"We've been looking for a good Chinese place in the northwest and haven't had much luck. I saw Little Dumpling when I was at Target in the same shopping center, so I bookmarked it on Yelp. Even though the reviews were varied, I had to give it a shot for myself. 
We were seated immediately and our drink orders were taken. After looking over the menu, we decided on the BBQ pork appetizer. I went with the orange chicken and my husband went with the sesame chicken. Our appetizer came quickly and it was good, but not the best BBQ I've ever had. Our food came as we were finishing the app up. We were given our plates (mine a small order, and my husband's the large) and a bowl of  steamed rice to share. If you're going to go family style, get the large orders and share. Otherwise, a small is perfectly generous portion for you to eat alone. My orange chicken was perfect-it had the crispy fried texture but was moist and tender on the inside, and the sauce was sweet but savory. My husband reported that his sesame chicken was good as well, but a large serving was definitely too much and he was able to take some home. Our service was great-the drinks were refilled multiple times, and even when they started getting busier, we weren't neglected. We are definitely adding it to our list of go-to Chinese spots!"}
{"text":"I like this place. They accept Paypal and deliver through eat24.com which is a hug plus for me. Food is always hot. Love the curries, crab ragon and sesame chicken. I order alot and the food is always correct."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall...but aren't all the best ones??!?
 When I lived in Vegas, this was the ONLY authentic Peruvian restaurant.  Their lomo saltado is delicious! I've had their jalea, aji de gallina, chaufa...almost all the items and their portions are generous. The alfajores and the lucuma ice cream are simply a little piece of heaven!"}
{"text":"It's been about 3 years since I last ate here and it was pretty bad.
I orders some of the spicy hot and sour soup today for the wife since she isn't feeling well with the sore throat and all.
The hot and sour soup did offer some comfort and the spiciness added some kick to clear things up when you aren't feeling well.
I order the shrimp fried rice and the vegetable lo mein, both were good. The shrimp in the fried rice was about a 1 in every three bite ratio, so its a bit skimpy.
The veggie lo mein was just acceptable. No real, \"I like this\" punch in any of the food and on the greasy side just a little bit.
Good value for the money and there is leftovers for later.
Not great, not awesome, just good enough and it's new owners from the people I last dealt with 3 years ago.
So from a 1 star to a 3 star. I'll be back again someday."}
{"text":"Third time visiting.  Ordered our usual Wor Wonton soup and 2 egg rolls.  Both my wife and I got major food poisoning later that night.  Not good."}
{"text":"Excited to find a Thai/Chinese fusion restaurant but were sadly disappointed at the amount of Thai dishes on the menu. We have tried several dishes. The combo plates have not been bad. We tried the Mongolian beef which was far too sweet for me. I was expecting a richer taste; not sweet. My husband liked it, however. He also tried the spareribs off the appetizer menu which were a good amount of meat for the price, albeit greasy but that is usually expected with ribs.

I liked the chow fun with chicken. I would have liked a bigger portion but it was tasty nonetheless. They make a good Thai tea here and we will be back to try other Chinese dishes. Unsure about the Thai food since other reviews were hit or miss."}
{"text":"Had take out from here the other night and liked this place a lot. We had the general's chicken and the mongolian beef, both were fantastic. Egg flower soup was great as well. We really liked that. Portion sizes were good (the soup in particular was huge) and the bill (rice is included) was only $24. Can't beat that. We live in the area so we'll be back frequently.

Edited to add that, over the last few weeks, we've tried their Thai options as well and like them a lot. The yellow, green, red and pineapple curries are all really good.  Chicken satays are tasty as well. This place is still a great value for the Thai as well. Don't get me wrong, its not the best Thai food ever, but its tasty and hits the spot. And cheap. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"After being disappointed by this place a few years ago, thought I would give them another chance. Should have stuck with my first impression. I ordered the Thai Beef Salad for take out and according to the online menu this is supposed to be spicy. When I picked it up, I asked if it was spicy, since they had not asked how spicy I would like it. I was told yes it is spicy. When I got it home, if you haven't guessed it was not spicy, not much flavor at all. The beef in the salad looked like it was prepared for beef and broccoli, not the strips of steak I'm used to, like you would get at a real Thai restaurant. Very disappointed and will not give it another chance.."}
{"text":"Dinner at Little Dumpling wasn't my choice, but I was open to trying it.

The restaurant serves Chinese AND Thai. It's one thing for a buffet or fusion restaurant to offer an array of dishes influenced by different cultures, but the red flags shoot up in my mind when I notice when a restaurant \"specializes\" in a wide range of cuisines.

Wonton Soup: Flavorless. I think I know how this was made - (1) Boil water and add frozen, mixed veggies, (2) Add 5 wontons. 

Panfried Chow Mein: It was fried, making it the best thing I ate out of the three items ordered.

Panang Curry: Curiosity got the best of me when I ventured to the \"Thai\" section of the menu. Sadly, the curry had a watery consistency. Not good at all. 

Service: The food arrives in an instant. 

Overall: I just have to pass up this place. Though the food is affordable and is delivered to your table almost immediately, I'd rather eat at Panda Express down the road."}
{"text":"Probably the best war won ton soup I've ever had. Lots of stuffed won tons, perfect amount of vegetables and the best tasting broth.   I could eat it everyday! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Yuck!! So disappointed.  The free egg roll and the crab Rangoon with no crab in it was the best part. We ordered a lot and it was not expensive, but definitely will not be going back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go to Little Dumpling after our shift. He ordered the chicken Thai dish and I ordered yellow curry. Big mistake on my part because it was watery with zero flavor. The diet soda had too much carbonated water to be palatable. 

We should have gone to China A Go Go but we were very hungry. For the same lunch special price we would have received multiple servings from China A Go Go.

Live and Learn...."}
{"text":"Disappointing and irritating would sum up this experience. We came here with the intention of ordering a quick to-go meal to satisfy a random craving of dumplings I had. Having been here before, regardless of the fact that their food by no means is standout, we figured we'd give their dumplings a shot as they were the closest place we could think of that had dumplings. We walked into a restaurant with maybe 6 people waiting around for food. It took the owner a few minutes to emerge from the kitchen to take our very simple order of some hot and sour soup, potstickers and wontons. This is an order which by no means should take a long time as most of it just involved boiling the preprepared meals. We proceeded to have to wait OVER AN HOUR for our food. At least a few other irritated customers voiced their opinions about how long the wait had taken. I never had anticipated waiting that long as my previous experiences there were NEVER this busy nor hectic. When finally actually eating the food, we found it to be about how we expected. Nothing in the least bit near spectacular or exciting considering the anticipation and cravings we had. The hot and sour soup was alright considering there's really not many options out in the Henderson area. It actually was a bit sour and spicy considering most places that have hot and sour soup have neither of the above. The dumplings were nothing special and nor was the wonton soup.

The food was subpar, the wait was absolutely ridiculous considering the simplicity of our order. They simply were way too understaffed and didn't have the decency of forewarning their diners that there would be an incredibly long wait. Instead, they chose to try and take on all orders at an incredibly slow pace, and proceed to cook the food even slower. This is not a place I would recommend if you're looking for a nice meal that you'll be at least satisfied with what you paid for. For the hour wait for your food, you'd be better of driving to Spring Mountain and actually getting a decent meal."}
{"text":"Fresh food, HUGE portions, great service, and the best Pad Thai we have had in a long time! Excited to come back!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials are great here! I had the \"Pineapple Chicken\" lunch special priced at just $5.95 and it came with soup and fried rice. The \"Egg Drop Soup\" was fantastic! It was a comforting soup on a chilly day. The amount of chicken surprised me. It tasted very good. The outside was crispy and the center tender. The rice was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of that too. I had a coupon that gave me 2 free \"Egg Rolls\" with a purchase of $15 or more. The egg rolls (veggie) were a bit on the greasy side, but tasted good. 

I was having lunch with friends and stopped in to order the food to-go. When we were about to have lunch and the food was getting set out, we noticed some \"Fried Wontons\" with our food that I didn't order. I have no idea what was in them, but they were greasy and good! Everybody enjoyed them so it was a nice and unexpected bonus!

They deliver and lunch specials are from 11am - 4 pm."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this location. I have eaten at the one in Henderson that was really good but this location just lacked in many areas. 
First let me talk about the service. It is the ONLY reason this place gets 3 stars and not 2 stars. The hostess was super friendly and checked on us at our table many times.  The server had a nice charm about him and was excellent at providing service to us. 
Now to the food. I ordered Strawberry Chicken and it just tasted like they simmered some strawberry jam and then poured in over the chicken. It was dripping with the sauce and that made the chicken very soggy. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was dry and lacked flavor. The soup was unlike any I have ever had it was almost gel-like and very strange.
I had high hopes from previous experience at the other location and the decor on the inside made the place look very upscale but the food is what it comes down too and it just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit. I needed a quick lunch to go, and Thai food always hits the spot! I ordered the tofu pad Thai lunch special. It came with soup and an egg roll. Very generous portion especially for the price! It was piping hot and worth the 10 minute wait. Call ahead if you're in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This place used to be OK, but now it's not even worth the effort.  The fried rice was mushy and flavorless."}
{"text":"First off. The portions....huge! I ordered the canton dinner for two with mongolian beef and cashew chicken. The bag was so heavy i couldn`t believe it. 

I wasn't expecting first class and nobody should as this place is just the typical takeout chinese place. Food came hot and delivered in about 50 minutes.

Overall I would order from here again. Food is decent and portions are a good bang for the buck."}
{"text":"This review is for a takeout.

I live super close to this chinese joint and because I was super hungry, decided on the pad see ewe.  I called in the order and got there w/in 2 mins.  The lady that helped me was nice.  My food was ready within 10 mins.  When I got home, I was surprise that there was a small bag of fried wontons and a small container of sweet and sour sauce.  Didn't know it came w/it like a typical fortune cookie would be.  

Well anyways, I enjoyed the wontons.  Then when I opened my contained with the pad sew ewe...Holy Moly, that's a lot of food!  However, quantity does not justify for the quality.  The big pieces of beef was kind of...eh...rubbery.  Very odd.  So odd, that I barely ate any of them.  The flat thick noodles were drenched with oil, as how chinese take out would be.  It doesn't taste like the other pad sew ewe that I have at other Thai restaurant.  Oh but wait, this is more of a Chinese take out, not Thai...

Hmm...I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy all the food here. Everything is always fresh and yummy. The chá thai is my favourite (thai tea) I like that it is not too sweet and has the stronger flavour. 

The Honey Walnut Shrimp is nice and sweet- but not over barring. Much better than Lulu's Hawaiian bbq. I also love to order the crab rangoon and fried wontons. Im not too big on the spring rolls but my brother loves them. 

My next favorite thing  is the pineapple fried rice, I really like the curry flavor inside. I do remove the cashews though. 

Overall, Little Dumpling on Decatur is very tasty. I definitely recommend it  to anyone seeking good, fresh, and yummy Chinese food ! :D

I love eating at Little Dumplings :D"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the almost five years since I moved to the neighborhood. I wonder if they changed hands since my first visit? I ordered the chicken pad thai (around $9 after tax) tonight and it was really not that great. The noodles don't seem to be rice noodles. I am used to more peanuts and cilantro. There was kind of a funny smell in the restaurant, as though they smoke inside when no one is there. It is also somewhat run-down and could be cleaner.

As another poster mentioned, no bean sprouts in the pad thai either. Disappointing experience."}
{"text":"If Yelp had a option of giving no stars I would for this place. My boss and I came here to give this place a try. And we shouldn't have gone in.

We were greeted when we came in and we ordered our food and things just went wrong from there. 

The \"Thai\" basil with ground chicken was so sweet to the point where I could feel my stomach disagreeing with me. Then came the string beans, also too sweet. And both dishes were covered with onions. It seemed like that was the only other vegetable they had.

And when it came down to the cold noodle salad, yam woosen, which I have had many times before, it was a complete disappointment. Once again sweet, and the meat in the dish seemed old.

I should have stuck with the Chinese food, when ordering here but, I won't be back. I do not recommend this place. Waste of money."}
{"text":"I have been searching for a decent Chinese restaurant for a few years now and I have finally found it! The hot and sour soup and the wonton soup were spot on. We ordered barbecue pork chow mein and moo shu pork which is next to impossible to find and both were fantastic, this restaurant is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Little dumpling came up on grubhub, my boyfriend works graveyard so we ordered delivery thinking it wouldn't take so long, it got 4 stars on grubhub so we thought it'd be good. I order my food at 7:30, they said it would be ready by 8:30. 8:30 comes around and still no food and I leave to take my boyfriend to work. I come back home, my roomates answered the door and had my food for me, and the 2 thai iced teas that I ordered where forgotten. So 2 hours for the good to get delivered and they forgot my thai iced teas that I paid for. I'm so mad I don't even want to taste the food, the service alone has left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight ... very good service, very good food, very good value ... we will return"}
{"text":"This review as of now is based on one visit and one plate. You have options between ordering Chinese or Thai dishes and lunch specials are available. I had the pad Woonsen lunch special. The price to portion ratio is exceptional. You get a lot of food for a few dollars. As far as flavor goes I will not be trying that dish anytime soon though I will be back to give another dish a try. For quick cheap eats this is an acceptable stop. Be sure to take advantage of the awesome lunch specials."}
{"text":"We were out running errands and found this place on Yelp and decided to try because it was the closest place to target. They had a standard lunch menu and the prices were decent ($6.50 i think). We had the crab Rangoon (way to sweet), pad Thai (too greasy/mediocre flavor/not a lot of meat), and red curry (was not \"liquidy\" enough...and the fried rice was hard).  I don't recommend this place, better off going to Thai style noodle house on rampart and lake mead."}
{"text":"I eat here under the same circumstances as when I would eat at Faustos--when I'm starving, low on cash, tipsy, or have many mouths to feed. Get the pot stickers. They're homemade and the dipping sauce is delicious. Another favorite of mine is the war wonton soup."}
{"text":"We loved the lunch specials!  They were affordable and served hot.  Service was excellent.  I would definitely come back here next time we're in town."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to this little spot when I wanted to go to China a Go Go.  She told me I needed to try the lunch special here.  Well, like most things, she was right.  This place is the bomb.  Cheap lunches a tons of food!  Although it is your standard Americanized lunch fare, the food tasted better and the plate filled me up.  If you're in the area, check this place out.  You won't be disappointing.  

Note: They did have more traditional Thai and Chinese items on the menu which I will definitely try at a later date."}
{"text":"Wasnt happy with the food here...
Got fried rice instead of white...didnt get my drink..and the food was just meh..."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Our usual order is the Singapore noodles (very good, sometimes dry), Hong kong pan fried noodles (amazing, just too much veggies for our liking), and the kung pao chicken--Now, we order extra chicken for $1 extra because they put more veggies than chicken all the time!!! And recently when we did order it delivery, they gave it to us in a 26oz box for $11 worth, when they usually put it in a full to-go plate. Def a rip off. I called to inquire and was told that chicken price has gone up so thats why it was put in the box instead of the full plate. I was so frustrated with them, I ended up hanging up. Overall, their food is good, but being stingy with chicken?? Come onnn now..."}
{"text":"This place was the worst of worst never have I tasted such gross food, found a hair in my food, vegetable rolls were just so nasty . We ended up throwing away 98. % of the food. This place needs closed down."}
{"text":"This is our go to chinese delivery. We always order either the Family plan A or B. Great deal on this and the amount of food we get we always have left overs. My favorite is the orange chicken and the chow mien chicken. Their hot and sour soup is good too."}
{"text":"Order came very hot and 15 mins early. It was very good I totally recommend the sweet donuts they were hot and delicious. 
Spring rolls I ate everyone's and saved my dinner for later. My daughter loved her orange chicken and my sweet & sour chicken"}
{"text":"Went in to pick up a to go order and they currently have a \"C\" health rating. One step above the health Dept closing it down."}
{"text":"Since I was a child, Wor Wonton Soup has been a requirement any time I am not feeling well. The other night I had the flu, and being new to the area I was stuck without a favorite Chinese food destination.

I took to the Internet and pulled up Yelp. Little Dumpling was 15 miles away, but had the best ratings. Man am I glad I took the drive. The Wor Wonton was excellent -- definitely hit the spot. I also had the cashew shrimp -- I ordered a small and it was still enough to share (with the soup).

I arrived to pick up the food a few minutes before it was ready - and was surprised to see spring rolls in the order which I hadn't asked for. I guess that's their way of saying \"sorry you had to wait\" -- Great service. 

Good food, good prices, good portions. I will certainly be back soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the salt & pepper squid, Panang curry chicken,  Hong Kong pan fried noodles, and sesame chicken. The food was excellent. Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I tried this place out because it is conveniently located close to home. 

Ordered the take out, off of the dinner menu. The one that includes a spring roll and a wonton. Didn't realize that neither of those were included in my bag when I reached home. The Moo Goo Gai Pan was decent, but it is difficult to mess up. The pork fried rice was interesting- seemed a little over cooked to me but it tasted decent. 

I might go again in the far future, but I'll definitely make sure to check my bag before I leave the restaurant."}
{"text":"hang over food here folks. The thing with these Chinese/Thai places is that they really never excel at either. I'm not saying this is a bad place to eat but it's nothing to write home about. 
I've actually eaten here several times but it's usually because of convenience or the need to get as many carbs in my system as humanly possible and what I mean by that is that the portions are good sized, the prices are decent. The green curry is decent, don't bother with the Pad Thai, the noodles are too gummy and it's just not authentic for my tastes. They do a decent Generals Chicken.
What I've noticed lately is that they kinda upped the place from a pretty casual place to white tablecloths and real silverware (they used to give you plastic sporks). Once I asked for extra napkins and she brought me ONE napkin, no joke.
If you're in the neighborhood and in the mood, check it out, if not, don't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"It's hard to tell if these types of Thai/Chinese places are going to be good. Can they really specialize in both and excel at both? Not usually. I've eaten at a few Little Dumplings around town and this is probably the best. I would say their specialty is more the Chinese side of things, it's good. It's fresh. 
On the Thai side, eh, not so much. I judge a Thai place by it's most popular dish - Pad Thai. It's the like a hamburger is to an American roadside grill. If you have that down, then you're golden. 
The Pad Thai here is so-so. Mas y menos. Noodles are a little limp, sauce kind of overwhelms. It's a good value though...at $7.95 it's two meals easy.
Nice staff though and the place can get busy so that tells me it's an OK kinda place"}
{"text":"This is yet by far the best fast Chinese food place I've been to in Las Vegas. Their chow mein is so good! And you get a lot for the price."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and the staff is nice but I gave them a 3 star because it is very expensive with very little food served on the plate. We had to flag the staff down to get water and rice. The best thing to try at this place is the Mongolian Beef, it is delish!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place! Their Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and fried rice were delicious! I've tried other restaurants but this one by far is our new favorite.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous!

I can't believe the low reviews on Yelp for Little Dumpling (I think people just like to complain because they have nothing better to do).  I've spent 4 years looking for a great chinese restaurant and finally found the very best!  Sure you can have 5 star food in the casinos, but you will pay $50 a plate for it.

The restaurant is spotless, small and simple.  I believe it is family owned, so all the more reason to come in and support a local business.  The menu is extensive, the portions are immense, and the price is very affordable for everything you get.  They even threw in two egg rolls for free!

Buddah's Delight: is the best in Henderson.  I'm a vegi connoisseur and this plate comes with my new found fav tofu.  The tofu is cooked perfectly, a bit of a sear that gives it great texture.  

Hot n Sour Soup: my wife loves this soup.  Spicy, dark and super flavorful.

Pineapple fried rice: this was very different for us as the chicken is separate from the rice but full of pineapple flavor.

Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.  I will visit Little Dumpling for my sole source of chinese food from now on.  

Thanks Little Dumpling!"}
{"text":"I also do not understand the bad reviews!
A friendly, family owned business.  I've been going there for years.  The Crab Rangoon is everything everyone says (and my son's favorite - If I'm lucky he'll let me have one!) No complaints ever about the Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, or Kung Pao Chicken.  All the veggies are cooked through yet never mushy.  But it's the shrimp dishes that I find amazing!  They serve really big perfectly cooked shrimp!   The Honey Walnut Shrimp heavenly and if I'm trying to be good its the Shrimp with Snow Peas.  Seriously, the best shrimp around!"}
{"text":"100% every time great food. Quick delivery, fast and friendly. Have never had a bad experience yet. This place is way better than New York Chinese food place. Food arrives hot all the time from Little Dumplings.AAAAAA +++++"}
{"text":"I've ordered to go before. And the dish I ordered was great. But today I ordered delivery which took an hour to get here and their website says \"within 45 minutes\". I also ordered the BBQ pork with mixed vegetables. The meat was tuff and the pork was NOT BBQ! I can make real Chinese BBQ pork so I know what it tastes like. It was more like tuff boiled pork. Tasteless! I will give them another chance. But will not order any pork from there."}
{"text":"Wow, this meal was so bad it caused me to finally sign up for yelp, while I was still sitting in the restaurant!! Ok, first thing first...there is barely any thai items on the menu. I asked if they made pad see ew and was told no! Most items appeared to be chinese of panda express quality. I ordered yellow curry and my boyfriend general tso chicken. After 10 minutes the waiter returned to tell me they didnt have any curry! Its on their menu?? So I ended up just ordering potstickers and a thai tea. My boyfriends chicken came up first and it looked like it was covered in a thick, jam like sauce. When you picked up a piece it actually had strings of sau e from it like a thick syrup. Gross! My boyfriends ice tea sat empty on the table the entire time and my potstickers finally arrived 10 minutes after his meal. We had to remind the waiter about the thai tea which was honestly the best part of the meal. The pot stickers were average at best. The fortune cookies were good... but the fortune really was a good metaphor for the meal...see pic attached Bottom line dont expect thai at this restaurant, and better yet just stay away."}
{"text":"I always order food delivery from this place . I live one street away and they charge 5 dollars delivery and that's never been a problem I even tip on top of that . I ordered a teriyaki bowl with extra teriyaki and she fucking sends me a bowl of straight sauce barely any rice and 3 nasty ass shrimps . When I called to tell her she didn't care and when I asked her to send another one so I can't eat she told me NO very rudely and hung up ...I suggest for nobody to go here . There horrible people who don't deserve to run a business ."}
{"text":"Cute little atmosphere, nothing too fancy here. Just order, pick  up and go, or order sit and eat. Simple. We stumbled in about 30 minutes to close and were pleased with the service. Most restaurant employees seem to get upset when you walk in anytime after an hour before close. These employees were kind, and did not seem bothered at all that we were there. 

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and the pork fried rice. The sweet and sour chicken was the bomb! The chicken was fresh with a light crispy crust, the sauce was perfectly balanced between sour and sweet and the plate was big and full. Not to mention the healthy serving of veggies chopped up in big chunks and spread around the chicken. The pork friend rice however wasn't my favorite. It was very generic fried rice with strips of chewy pork. Bleck. I will not be ordering that again. 

I would have most likely given this joint 4 out of 5 stars however nearing the end of our meal one of the chefs came out and let out a huge burp in front of us. Not exactly professional or appetizing. I would definitely order take out from here. I might not dine in again though as the experience turned out to be a little confusing."}
{"text":"I have tried this place and the one in North Las Vegas and both have their names very fitting: Little DUMP-ling! Heavy on the DUMP! service sucks and food suck! will never eat at any of the locations Ever! I don't recommend coming here! condiments had dust on them like they've never been used and/or wiped clean! Don't say, I didn't warn you!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Huge value! Fabulous food ! So glad we found this place! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We've been frequenting this place for a couple of years now. Usually on a lazy evening when we don't feel like cooking or eating out. We'll get on Eater 24 and order online which is really convenient. You're able to order whatever you want, modified however you like without problems. 

Haven't had a great variety, as we typically order a small rotation of things. The Spring Rolls are great. Crispy, delicious and cheap. I always order the Hot and Sour soup. It's just about the best I've had in town. It's a hard one to find made properly. A little bit of spice and just the right amount of vinegar. Overall, this place hits the spot for what it is. Small, hole in the wall take out place that makes pretty decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Not bad, not good. I had the green curry chicken dish and it wasn't bad. However, since this was my first green curry experience ever, I cannot really compare it to anything else. Thai ice tee was really good. Service was ok. 
It was weird they had Tapatio (Spanish hot sauce) on the tables. Why??? I thought Sriracha would have been more appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was standard Chinese fare. The wonton soup is very good and worth the upgrade.

When I went, they seemed short staffed and overwhelmed. Had a long wait between wait staff visits. Place needed cleaning from an apparent lunch rush."}
{"text":"Average taste, Great Price!!

Just average Chinese Food at this location, but price is decent enough to maybe come back.  I had their Orange Chicken, Fried Rice, Egg Flower Soup, and Fried Noodles.  All of this for around $7 at lunch.  The soup, fried noodles, and fried rice was just average.  I thought that the sauce on the Orange Chicken was a little too thick.  Looked like a sap bleeding off a tree.  Scary, almost tasted like it.  

Restaurant is a little small, but it really doesn't get busy here.  Been only my 3rd time here and it's never been poppin'.  Service is pretty good though and I can't complain about that.  

Prices are pretty good, service is great, and the food is just okay.  Their Egg Flower Soup on a cold day may be enough to maybe come back."}
{"text":"It was so good! Definitely better than 
China-A-Go-Go! I was a little skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but everything we ordered was perfect! We had it delivered and it arrived right on time, 45 minutes exactly! 

The teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour chicken, wonton soup, pot stickers, spring rolls, pork fried rice and steamed rice was great! No complaints at all! The portions were a good size, plenty of chicken and a lesser amount of veggies than anticipated but very delicious and we have plenty of left overs. 

I wanted to order the beef and snow peas but after reading the reviews on here I decided not to order any of the beef entrees. So thanks y'all!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, and their food is very good, the portions are big. They serve Boba, and they give you a good amount of boba balls :) Only thing is that sometimes they take a while(a long while sometimes) for takeout-but still very good"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss when it good its good but when its bad its baaaaad.  The only reason i have gone back is because it has been good. But lately. Ugh. In addition the lady behind counter is so nasty. She is even nasty when you call. Try to call and see for yourself.  If she is nice pigs will fly. Due to her stinky attitude and bland food i will not go back. I give up.  The food tasted like her attitude, bad.  If my money was bad they would not take it. So if the service and food is bad i will not take it. Good luck"}
{"text":"I've come here with my husband a few times, one reason being for the crab legs because it's really not expensive. The crab legs aren't always up to my standards but that's what you get for an inexpensive resturaunt. They just taste like sea water. They have a sushi bar, salad bar, so many different options of dishes to try from which we really enjoy. They served small octopus one night we were there, I dare not try that though! The service isn't bad and with the horrible 90's pop music they play over the speakers it kind of makes you laugh and takes you back to those days. Overall this place is decent."}
{"text":"Got exactly what I ordered and delivered within 20 minutes nothing to complain about here."}
{"text":"Service was ok , took a long time to get some one to take our order and drink order for only have one other person in the restaurant , food was mediocre."}
{"text":"We are locals here (part of the year here, part elsewhere).  We eat out every single day. We recognize that the restaurant business is a difficult and tricky business to achieve success in. We eat in divey out of the way places and in high end expensive restaurants (think Hank's in GVR).  It is with this in mind we write reviews.

I have been looking for a local Chinese food restaurant that didn't serve \"glop\" with sodium (Panda Express-ish).  We've found it in this little, tucked away restaurant. This is exactly what it looks like - a no frills, good service, freshly prepared delicious food restaurant.   No hot dishes of food sitting over sterno or on a steam table drying out and loaded with salt.

The food is fresh, made to order (so there is a little wait if you dine in), and delicious. Service inside is excellent.   The portions are HUGE (we ordered Lo mein, Vegetable Fried Rice and Salt and Pepper Shrimp) and very reasonably priced.  We are big eaters and we made almost two full meals for two out of this order.

The Shrimp Lo-Mein had plenty of shrimp in it, wasn't greasy and was very flavorful. The Salt and Pepper Shrimp was excellent - both Salty and spicy from the Pepper. Really a good choice.

They have an extensive menu.  They do an extensive Take-Out business and we are personally so happy to have found a terrific Chinese Food restaurant!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted Thai food for our quick lunch date. I found this place on yelp and thought we'd give it a try. From the outside it looked small but once you walk in the place is actually quite big and looks nice.

 I ordered water to drink and he got pink lemonade. This is going to sound crazy, but that water was disgusting. It was stinky and had a horrible after taste. Seriously! Water! I got nervous because I've never had \"bad\" water while eating out. My husband's drink had the same fully after taste. 

I had the corn and egg soup. It wasn't bad or good so that was kind of a wash. 

My husband hand the chicken chili mint. That's his favorite Thai dish. It didn't really look or taste like the traditional chicken chili mint. It wasn't really spicy and was covered in a thick sauce which is not normal either. I had the General Taos Chicken lunch meal that comes with, fried rice and crab rangoon. 

The Chicken was good at first but half way through the extremely sweet taste was too much. It was almost like it was covered in a marmalade. The crab rangoons which are always my favorite were also extremely sweet in the filling. It was almost like frosting in taste and texture. Not pleasant, so I didn't finish the 1st one let alone touch the second. The fried rice was bland. I mean really bland. It was eating white rice that just looked brown. 

Needless to say, we won't be going back there at all. I guess we've been spoiled with the food at other places like the Bangkok Orchid in Green Valley.
 
Now if I could just get this awful after taste to go away! It's been a few hours!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this Chinese place. the food is not so good and the customer service sucks.. the lady that takes your order in the front barely speaks to you when you come in."}
{"text":"If there is a no star rating, I WOULD GIVE A NO STAR!
Take it from me, I'm Chinese and I know what Chinese food should taste like.
I ordered tomato beef(a dish off the menu list) and it tasted nothing like it. The cook put in few slices of tomatoes and used canned sweet & sour sauce and the meat was too chewy(under cooked). The chow mein was too greasy, they used too much cooking oil in the dish. I eggrolls were nasty, not fresh, mushy, tasted like it's been thaw from freezer and put into the fryer. The customer service is terrible, no smile, no greeting, put me in a hurry up pace. The food was terrible and I would not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"I first came here about a month ago and we ordered the Thai dinner set menu to go. It had a variety of items and we all liked it. 

I thought I would try it again, so yesterday my family and I went to dine in. I ordered the yellow curry.  I should have known better when the server said \"just to let you know it's American style\". Not knowing what that actually meant, I figured I would try it. Big mistake. It wasn't anything like curry. They didn't even use coconut milk. It was just some chicken in some kind of gooey green sauce. It wasn't horrible, but not what I wanted. Actually I think this was their version of green curry and I ordered the yellow. Who knows maybe the yellow is better? 

Sadly, I didn't settle right later in the evening and I had to drink chamomile tea to calm my stomach. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery for this place after finding my go-to place closed. The chicken pad thai noodles were alarmingly orange in color and mushy. I know the sauce can stain and color the noodles, but I'd never had them that color. Usually they are a muted rusty reddish orange. Despite the neon hue, they didn't actually have much flavor.

The pad see ew noodles were also overcooked  and mushy, and the sauce was overly sweet. Pad see ew is usually my favorite, so I was disappointed by its lack of flavor and sweetness. The meat(chicken and beef) in both dishes lacked color and flavor.

All in all, it just seemed like the food was missing something. I don't know if it was simply because I didn't order any of my food hot or what, but I have never had a problem with dishes lacking flavor anywhere else when I ask for less of a spicy kick."}
{"text":"Great Chinese!  One of the better options around town.  Would probably give it a 3.5-4.  However, we tried their Thai menu tonight, and they have no business offering this menu.  The yellow curry chicken was almost green, watered down, and the chicken was typical of Chinese dishes.  The Pad Thai was bland and seemed to lack ingredients.  I will be back for Chinese, but have to first get over the money I threw away for the Thai experience."}
{"text":"If you order food from this place to go make sure you ask for fork and napkins because they don't include them!  We found out when we hot to the hob site!   when i called they told me i should of asked for them!  WTH??"}
{"text":"We will never be back again. The food was disgusting. My yellow curry look like snot and tasted about the same. Didn't know you could mess up yellow curry. I couldn't even eat my meal. :("}
{"text":"I absolutely loveeee little dumpling so much I always order delivery when I have lazy days and don't leave the house, because it's very close to my house too. So today I wanted to do the same but I haven't really had much of an appetite as I am kind of sick today, but I had to eat so I decided I'll have a little something from there and I was craving their amazing Thai tea boba. So I called in and asked for 6piece crab Rangoon, 2 veggie egg rolls and a Thai tea boba for delivery. The girl on the phone asked me if that's all I want three times and I said yes please and yes thank you. Then she went ahead and said wow okay only 3 items k 12.17 bye. I was just astonished by the treatment I got by her she didn't ask where it was going to be delivered or my name. I wonder if she even took down the order and had my food prepared. The food is amazing don't get me wrong there have been times I ordered food for like 10 people from here but the lady on the phone really made me regret calling in to order. I should have just stuck to Grubhub I guess, I just did not expect that kind of awful customer service from a place I have been ordering from for like 2 years now. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Overall it was disappointing.  Noodles were soggy and nothing was seasoned corecctly. Asked gor very spicy and there was no heat. Gets 2 stars becaus the fried rice and eggrolls are great."}
{"text":"We have been ordering to go for a couple of years. The last 2 times they have  had problems. Yesterday we ordered 4 dishes, egg foo young and Moo Shu Chicken.
When we got the order home and opened the Moo Shu, we thought something was wrong and finally figured out that it did not include any cabbage. As we eat we discovered the Egg Foo Young was burned. Because we generally like this place, I called to let the owner know of the problem in the kitchen. She was very impolite and in effect called me a liar about the cabbage. She did offer to refund the cost of the egg foo young, but I was so upset over her attitude I declined. We will now look for another Chinese restaurant with a better attitude and customer service."}
{"text":"I had never had Peruvian food before going to eat in this small joint. The decorations are pretty sparse but interesting. It's also interesting that they serve Chinese and Peruvian food. I don't know much about Peruvian food but I had a dish with meat, gravy, French fries and rice all on one plate. My wife and I have eaten here twice and enjoyed it both times."}
{"text":"We ordered from here for the first time tonight. Very impressed! Food was very good, and arrived hot. Recommended."}
{"text":"Just moved to this side of town and am always looking for good Chinese food. I drove past the sign and decided to check it out. I didn't know it was mostly a take out place but once I was there decided to give it a try anyhow. I was surprised to see how  reasonable to prices were - great lunch specials. I ordered the Mongolian beef for myself and the Teriyaki chicken bowl for my husband. The food took about 15 minutes so i was confidant everything was cooked to order. Everything was delicious!! I would have given it 5 stars but when i pulled up outside at 11:15am (supposed to open at 11am)  the doors to the place were still locked and lights off... I was about to pull away when the owners showed up and welcomed me in. I am glad  they caught me otherwise I would have missed out!!"}
{"text":"Hello...this is a Cantonese style place, not Thai.  I ordered the Pad Thai - chicken for lunch.  Meh.  I'm allergic to white onion, and the many pad thai dishes in Thailand I've had dont include onions.  This had all kinds of chinese style cooking - onions, too much sauce, egg roll, fried wonton for snack, sweet and sour soup app.  
So = go for chinese, not thai or at least know it's modified thai and you'll be happy.  

BTW - they fixed the onion error VERY quickly.  Seems like a nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I came in 15 minutes before close and got my food to go and the hostess wasn't perturbed or give me attitude (like I would have if I were in her shoes.) Food was out quickly and I did receive a lot for the average price. Right around the corner from Dad's house so I won't hesitate to go back for late night vegetarian fix."}
{"text":"Small little hidden place, but worth a try. 

When i visited Peru, i was amazed how many Chinese restaurants there were. After returning to the States, I really missed it because it had a different flavor than the Chinese food i was use to. Well Little Dumpling Chinese/Peruvian has really good Chinese food, and their Peruvian Food awesome as well. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way... As mentioned above, this is a take out joint primarily.  If you reviewed on the ambiance or waiting service, its the equivalence of rating a hot dog stand for its lack of decor or comfy upscale seating.  If you are this type of reviewer, please step away from your computer.  Understanding this is mainly a takeout/delivery place is common sense.  There are almost no tables, no sign to either wait to be seated or to seat yourself, and no reception area whatsoever.  There is a waiting bench right by the cashier and you can clearly see tons of takeout bags and boxes being prepped on the counter.

As far as takeout and delivery service goes, they are excellent.  They always get the order right, including special instructions, and now you can order from them online.  Everything is well wrapped or contained neatly and perfect for carryout.  Soups are in sturdy plastic containers and they do not scrimp on size, or give less because they do not have a large enough container.  Large orders are placed in sturdy boxes.  Everything is  prepped well for the travel and upkeep of the food, and even reheat.  They don't go cheap in this area, even their napkins are nice and thick good napkins.

Little Dumpling also excels in terms of price and value.  They tend to be cheaper then your regular Thai places like Siri or Pin Kaow, and as cheap or cheaper than a Panda Express.  Yet you get a lot more not just with volume but where it counts.  When I order a meat dish, there is tons of meat, not filled with oversized chunks of onion or a disproportionate amount of baby corn or bamboo shoot and other filler.  When i order a shrimp soup from other Thai places Im usually hoarding the shrimp, saving it because there are only 5.  At Little Dumpling I am never for more meat or key ingredients like mushrooms.  The portions are also huge.  A takeout order of Pad See Ewe can easily feed 4 (if you are also ordering something else family style) and have leftovers.

For a divey takeout place like this, I might give it 5 stars  given everything I've stated so far. (context, I judge according to what it is supposed to be).  What keeps this place from being stellar is that the food is hit or miss.  Almost all the typical chinese lunch specials like Orange Chicken are good, especially the ones centered around meat (like the former) but other standouts are Lemon Chicken, Orange Beef and Beef with Broccoli.  The beef is usually good, not the poor quality small grey chewy scraps you find at other chinese places.  The beef is usually cooked well, really good sized pieces and good quality.  Im not talking about a Morton's cut, Im speaking comparatively.  The broccoli is usually cooked just right as well with just enough crisp but not crunchy, soggy or greasy.

All the meat centered Chinese dishes are great as mentioned.  Surprisingly, the best dishes are some of the Thai ones.  The Pad See Ewe is great, just the right ratio of noodles to egg to beef and veggies.  They also make it a little spicy if wanted, without losing its flavor to the heat.  My favorite dish here is the Tom Yum Kung soup.  It's swampier than I've had from Thai restaurants, but every ingredient comes bursting through.  You can really taste the lemongrass, tomato, and spices all meld together beautifully in their soup.  I've tried many other thai places, and no Tom Yum Kung comes even close to comparing.  Almost all have only 5 shrimp, and microscopic ones at that, cheap small mushrooms, with an overpowering sour taste and little of other flavors coming through.

Some of the dishes can sometimes be just as greasy as Panda Express.  Ironically their fried dumplings are nothing special, but fine.  And steer clear of their Japanese dishes, like Teriyaki bowl - I don't know why you would order that from places like this anyways, and if you are that person, you probably don't listen to reviews and tips anyways"}
{"text":"Had a craving for pad see ew, surprisingly wasn't on the menu. Had pad thai instead and some soup with shrimp and mushrooms. Food was pretty good and staff was very attentive and friendly , would definately come back again"}
{"text":"This place is close and convenient, though it is not always quick. They have a pretty good lunch menu, and prices are pretty decent. A lot of main entrees in the \"small\" size are around 5.95, but are very filling. I like the beef chow fun and the sesame chicken. The sesame chicken is super garlic-y, but I love the sauce. They also have milk teas in different flavors.. I'd suggest sticking to the milk tea and skip the boba haha.

I would skip the fried rice, cashew chicken, and lemon chicken. The fried rice and cashew chicken are really greasy. The lemon chicken is basically chicken katsu with a side of bright-yellow \"lemon\" sauce for dipping...not too appealing."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant when I first moved to Las Vegas about 5 years ago, but only today did I try it again (there was no particular reason for the long delay).

I went Thai style and was not disappointed.

Yellow curry beef, delicious. I've been to Bangkok and I've had home-cooked Thai food for years, this was really good. Home style is a bit more thick on the curry, but this was delightful.

Tom Yum Kai, also delicious, with the caveat that I asked for Thai spicy with the usual \"I've been to Bangkok...\" etc, just short of writing it out in Thai. Not disappointed, in fact I was set back on my heels a bit for the first few tastes until my body remembered.

A nice little spot in a Vons strip mall up here in north part of town, definitely on my list of places and it will not be so long until the next time.

(Note, this order was delivered by DoorDash, and the food arrived so hot and well-packaged that it was tricky to un-bag it without giving it a moment to cool... no complaint there)"}
{"text":"I've been to this location over 10 times.  A very good small neighborhood Chinese Restaurant.  Well over a hundred menu options.  Friendly staff, good food, best price.  If you want more options, bigger, fancier, and perhaps the best tasting, go to Benihanas.  This is usually a 3 or 4 star experience."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch special which was around $6 with tax included. I wanted chow-mein noodles included and did not mind the upcharge which came out to 12.91. When I received my food the chowmein was bland , no veggies just plain dry noodles. Disappointed I called and requested a refund and advised I would return the food. The woman on the phone grunted in response and did not say anything. I called back and she said bring the food back and hung up on me. When I arrived to get my refund she grabbed the box and took it into the back work station and returned with the rest of my food sprawled all over as if done in spite. She tried to refund me $3 for the chow mein meaning I paid $9 for a very little portion of orange chicken and rice and if you've had the lunch special you know exactly what I'm talking about. I refused the money and decided to dispute the charge with my bank. I contacted them to see if the charge had cleared and they informed me I was actually charge $17. I did not authorize this charge and will never return to this bs ass place. I knew something was wrong when they said they would have my order ready in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"That was the most disgusting Chinese food ever. It smelled so good but when I looked at it I knew something was wrong. I ordered the combination rice.....It suppose to come with chicken, shrimp and BBQ pork. Okay.....The pork was not BBQ it was raw, warmed meat....the chicken was chewy looking and undercooked, the shrimp looked warmed as well. It seems like they may microwave their food, which explains how fast it was prepared. I didn't even eat it. I had already tasted the egg roll, and little chips they provided, which was the only thing I had....Now my throat is starting to close and tongue is swelling. I'm allergic to crab and I hope they didn't cook it in the same oil...My husband ordered the veggie with tofu meal...Its called the Buddha delight. He threw his out too after we began reading the reviews on here. Soooo we just wasted money on crap food. I'm reporting them to Action13 news or something because honestly I don't think they're up to code."}
{"text":"We are new to Vegas and are searching for a good Chinese restaurant. Little Dumpling was not what we are looking for. The Lo Mein noodles were mushy, the Mongolian beef was almost flavorless. The real surprise when I crunched into egg shells when I bit not the Egg Pho Yong. Yuck! Plus, there was no gravy.  The Moo Goo Gah Pan was good  as was the rice. But good is a long way from great. We'll keep up our search for a great Chinese restaurant. Little Dumpling was not what we were searching for."}
{"text":"Nothing really special. I've tried better. Everything was too sweet.  Waste of money. Service was just okay."}
{"text":"best in town ! Fresh delicious food with the best service!! And delivery is quick and piping hot!"}
{"text":"I truly do not take giving 1 star reviews lightly.  I know it can make or break a business and owning a restaurant in these times must be a struggle with competition.  You would think that would make Little Dumpling try extra hard.  

All that being considered carefully, this was the worst Chinese food I've had.  Ever.  It was so bad that I am not even willing to give them a second chance. 

The Gen Tso chicken - had the texture of precooked, frozen, deep fried, re-deep fried and then deep fried, again.  It wouldn't break down after chewing it & chewing it.  Dry, flavorless, with goopy syrup at the bottom.  I could have soaked it in water and it would have kept its dry texture.
People who have raved about this dish from here have never had good Gen Tso.  

BBQ Pork fried rice - Tasteless.  No bbq flavor except they may have dripped some liquid smoke into it.  Plus, very greasy.

Chicken Fried rice - Weird Chemical aroma and tasteless.  Plus, very greasy.

House special dumplings - These were fairly tasty, I have to say, but again very greasy.

Egg rolls -  these were inedible.  Shiny pools of dripping greasy oil.  No exaggeration.  Almost soggy.

Corn soup -  Slimy with about 5 kernels of corn through the pint.  Tasted like gelatin.

Just terrible.  $45 with the tip.  Arrived on time."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery thru GrubHub today. I ordered around 4:40pm and I didn't get my order until 6pm. I live less than 10 minutes away down the street. When I got my order, the whole bag was soaked with liquid because the containers were were faced vertical, not flat down like you'd normal place containers. Not sure if the driver was speeding and turned corners fast but everything was soaked."}
{"text":"One day I had a crazy day at work where I had worked like 31 hours in one day. My mom so happens to call me to ask me if I want to get food with her, and I said I'm too tired to move. She says, well, I'll pick you up and we'll go to this Peruvian place. Off we go, as my admittedly tired self tries to make small talk. We end up here, at Little Dumpling. The place was mostly empty... a party of four was leaving there table, and another table had clearly just been left, too. Or was it...?

So we sit down to wait for our menus and drink orders. A kid comes up and says he'll be right with us and heads into the back of the restaurant, into the kitchen area. Great. So we wait. And wait. And wait some more. He emerges with our menus like ten minutes later and asks what we'll drink. Inca Kola, of course. Then he takes our orders, as we had plenty of time to decide what we wanted while we waited. 

We finally get our food, and it was pretty good. Nothing amazing, but it wasn't as poor as my mood. My parents were not too happy with their food, though I was. But we all agreed that the portions were generous, and a pretty good deal. My parents would have rated this place four stars on value alone, though I give it three: yes, it was a value, but so is a $.89 cheeseburger... but that's not why we came here!

During the hour or so we were here, the other two tables were never cleared. They sat there the whole time, while the kid who served our food chilled in the kitchen. Another family walked in as we were walking out, and they seemed to know the kid who worked there. They asked about his sister or his mom or something, and he seemed happy to see them. I bet they didn't wait ten minutes for a menu..."}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and I have to say that if you understand Asian cuisine, the difference between Thai and Chinese dishes, that this is not a bad little spot.  Had the pot stickers, Hong Kong Noodles, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce and Mongolian Beef.   It's a great little spot for those jonesing for a Chinese or Thai fix.  Service was great and attentive.  The kids loved it as well.  Definitely will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"My office orders from here usually once a week. I normally end up getting their Honey Walnut Shrimp with white rice or their General Tso's chicken. We normally get a larger order so I've also tried some of their other menu items as well. The food is alright, I've experienced better. My problem is just with overall flavor, the entrees just seem to lack a lot oomph. That being said their egg drop soup, eggrolls and wontons are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"The food was great my only disappointment was the crab and cream cheese rangoons, there was absolutely no crap and no cream cheese just a very dry hard crispy rangoon!"}
{"text":"We have Little Dumpling deliver to our house at least a few times per month.  You can't beat the prices and portion sizes - we get dinner for 3 and leftovers for days delivered to our door for under $40 including tip.  It usually takes about 40 minutes from order to door and the food is always well-packed and accurate.  I agree with another reviewer that the pork fried rice is delicious, so is the moo shu pork."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.  Wonderful food and service for a reasonable price.  The portions are very generous.  Very friendly staff.  Hot and Sour soup the best I have ever had.  Very fresh and tasty dishes."}
{"text":"They were able to substitute the Basil Mint with meat to tofu. So i'm guessing they can do that with any of the meals on the menu which is great! I've only been here once but the workers are polite and the atmosphere is calm. Their spice levels aren't based on hotness they're more on flavor which is not a bad thing, it was still a little spicy but the flavor was delightful!"}
{"text":"I have a yelpy resolution to dine at several Chinese restaurants in the Las Vegas Valley. As 2014 transitions into the New Year, my Chinese restaurants list will grow. I aim to review fifty Chinese restaurants by 2016. This review of Little Dumpling Chinese Restaurant is my most recent fulfillment of this yelpy resolution. It is based on my recent visit during lunch before Acacia Demonstration Gardens. 

  Little Dumpling is actually the Hidden Dumpling. It is buried in the small Starbuck's strip mall on the Northeast corner of Horizon Ridge Parkway at Stephanie Street  by Walgreen's. 

  The parking lot is too cramped that there is a greater risk of a car dent. Just as I do when I visit the Starbuck's here, I walk a short distance further to park by Walgreen's. 

  This is essentially a take-out setting with a handful of tables and unadorned walls. The silverware and plates is throwaway paper and plastic. This is the quintessential setting for a Chinese restaurant lunch special. 

  The lunch specials that end at 4 PM cost between $5.95 and $6.25. The shrimp based entrees cost $6.25. The lunch specials include chow mein noodles or fried rice with the soup of the day. Of course the soup of the day is egg drop soup. With the addition of a beverage, the lunch special comes out to $8 and change. I ordered the shrimp chop suey. It was okay. I have tasted better, that is for sure. They did give a fair amount of shrimp. 

  There is a flaw in the design of the restaurant. That is that the restroom is too close for comfort to the tables. Little Dumpling ought to invest in a louder vent or something to block out noises that are not conducive to the customer enjoying their meal. 

  In my opinion Little Dumpling is an okay Dumpling. I have no urgency to return."}
{"text":"I went here last night to get some red curry with shrimp (level 8 spicy). I hadn't ate all day and was craving some Thai food so I decided to go in and give it a try. It was an average price $10 but what I got was Hardly curry. The shrimp and veggies completely filled the container to the top and the sauce was like water and only went 3/4 of the way up. I was so confused. Not to mention it tasted terrible and had zero spice or flavor. Really ruined my night and morning for I woke up starving because the curry couldn't even be eaten. Oh yeah and the rice was hard."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and the service great. Nice and friendly staff. I have been driving by this place going to the doctor and really wanted to try it. I'm glad I did. Comfy atmosphere, I really liked the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the customer service superb ordered the pineapple chicken fried rice which was phenomenal and paired it with Mongolian beef, the combo was great I was unsure walking in and am very glad I did."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A Chinese place that doesn't suck in Henderson, and they offer Thai food too! With a house full of hungry people wanting Chinese food and not wanting another lame experience I turned to Yelp! (of course) but the reviews for Little Dumpling left me unsure. But I took a chance and ordered. Sometimes you swing and miss, but once in a while you can knock one out of the park and Little Dumpling was a home run with everyone. In depth details....here we go. Straight from the Eat24 online order receipt which made ordering a breeze! 

22. Chicken Lo Mein  - My 2 year old loved it. So much so that when we took his plate away thinking he was done he asked me to bring it back. That's ultra rare. 
 
35. Sweet and Sour Chicken  - Premium chicken, great flavor, no skimpy food here. 
 
79. Vegetable Egg Foo Young  - When this gets compared to our gold standard Chinese place we used to love in Denver, and is ranked even better than that...what else can I say about it? They loved it! 
 
92 Thai Tea   - The nice lady at the counter almost forgot this until I asked her to double check the order. I'm sure glad she did...it was pretty dang good if I do say so. 
 
42. Kung Pao Chicken  - Good, but not great. Why? It needed a bit more spice. Every dish seen here was medium spiced...but Kung Pao needs to be hot. Fiery hot. This one...was just good. Still loved it enough that I'll order it again. 
 
38. General Tso's Chicken  - My wife puts me to shame when it comes to being a critic and when she says it doesn't suck and she smiles from ear to ear...yeah, this one made my house happy let me tell ya. 
 
8. Pot Sticker  - OMG. These ain't the crappy potstickers other places try and stick you with. These are premium meat hand made masterpieces with a little kick of spice that slapped my tongue around. 
 
3. Crab Rangoon - Holy crap, they put the crab into the crab rangoons and you can taste it. This ain't the cream cheese wontons that other places call crab rangoon. This is the good stuff. 
 
9. Chicken Teriyaki on a Stick -  Good, enjoyable, will order again, but not my personal favorite. 

If you've read this far know this. They are hidden in behind Starbucks and tucked in behind Walgreens. If you can't find it go to Walgreens and use their driveup pharmacy lanes. When you are at the window for Walgreens your headlights would shine right into Little Dumpling. 

Will I go back? Heck yes. I dropped almost $70 on Chinese food here and this is the first time I've finished eating with everyone and nobody said it sucked. That's ultra rare as I seem to live with a lot of critics. And when they compare it to our all time favorite places...enough said. For a first impression Little Dumpling made one heck of a good impression. Add on Service with a Smile, and they boxed everything up and it was easy to carry it all out...oh and one last thing. Their spicy Chinese mustard will sneak up on you and kick your ass. Sorry for the profanity but you've been warned. 

4 Stars...don't want to jinx them with a 5, I'll save that last star for a review of their Thai offerings. If they nail the Thai food...that 5th Star will be posted."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp pad thai to go. It's a lot for one person. I liked it though but they didn't add a lot of shrimp. Just like maybe four???... And the shrimp wasn't that good. My husband also ordered the teriyaki chicken. He was very disappointed. Not that much chicken. Everything was filled with vegetables on the bottom. And a couple pieces of chicken on top."}
{"text":"Worst Chinese food ever!
First of all, there is another \"Little Dumplings\" on N Decatur which is quite good. This place, not so much. I ordered the pad Thai, no spice, overly sweet and the shrimp tasted like mackerel. The Mongolian beef also had no spice and was overly sweet, the beef had a texture of something other than that from a cow. The crab rangoons tasted like something out of a gas station vending machine. The salt and pepper shrimp, I love this dish, but not from here. They actually fry and season the shrimp with the shell on! Not just over the tail, the entire shrimp. I usually love leftovers as its a nice meal/slash snack the next day, this wasn't worth the space in my fridge. The lo mein was edible, barely. Even if I were to get a refund it would not make up for the awful experience."}
{"text":"The all Asian food here is fantastic. Combo Chinese and Thai Restaurant...great tasting and flavorful...not to spicy...Boba drinks in different fruits flavoring...A must place to dine...."}
{"text":"Little Dumpling was very delicious. I ordered take out food last night. It was finished in about 10 minutes. The sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken, and crab rangoons. Thank you."}
{"text":"Second time eating Little Dumpling..first was take out and now in the restaurant. It's clean, service was impeccable and all of the food was delicious. Ingredients taste fresh, cooked perfect and food comes out so fast. I'm confused by the 3 star rating honestly."}
{"text":"While being sick and to weak to make dinner I decided to order their delicious food . Unfortunately after an hour and a half wait the wrong order arrived and it cost more then my original order. I called and their excuse was the were busy and the store manager was helping the driver make deliveries. The woman I spoke to through the manager under the bus saying that she messed up and gave us the wrong order. Either way I asked for  my money back which they complied and they said we could keep the wrong order."}
{"text":"First time I ever had dayglo orange pad thai! It was just wrong! The won tons in my won ton soup were like leather. This was a first and last experience for me and sad as the staff was friendly :("}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option I would go with that. We ordered smalls of teriyaki chicken,  Mongolian beef, beef broccoli and an order of both crab Rangoon and fried wontons.

The entrees came with plain white rice. You have to pay extra if you want fried rice or any other option. The Mongolian beef could easily be described as salted onions with a few pieces of beef. Not what you would normally get or at least not what we thought we'd be getting. The teriyaki chicken can easily be mistaken for broccoli beef if we didn't also open up that container. The flavor wasn't very good, I could probably make it at home without problem. The broccoli beef had more carrots then I've ever seen. Beef on this one was fatty and hard to chew. 

As for the appetizers. The \"crab\" Rangoon consisted of small over cooked cream cheese only pieces. No crab flavor, no seasonings. Just Rangoon....where was my crab meat? The fried wontons were also hard and were not seasoned very well. 

All of the food arrived barely warm so ordering delivery isn't a good suggestion. We through a good 90% of it away for being over cooked or poor tasting and ended up ordering pizza. 

Also, the delivery man was very rude. He rang the doorbell until I opened it. Not like once or twice but repeatedly until I made my way down stairs to open the door. It's not like I was being slow either. Then when I opened the door he was on his phone with earphones in talking to someone. He handed me a large paper receipt and pen. Didn't say anything (I knew I had to sign so I did). I handed it back to him and he handed me my food. He again didn't say a thing to me. No thank you, no repeating of my order, nothing. He began to walk away and looked at the receipt and began to turn around almost to discuss his tip. I closed my door and just happened to look through my peep hole in the door and he was still standing there all angry like, like I did something to him. \"Sir you got a tip and didn't say a word. Be thankful I am a nice person\"

WILL NOT ORDER HERE AGAIN AND SUGGEST YOU TRY SOMEWHERE ELSE AS WELL!"}
{"text":"Ok I've said this before. Seriously. WTF is strawberry chicken? The cook was probably sitting there. Oh Americans they like the orange chicken. Why they eat so much? Oh Mr Fried Chicken I walk with you in my hand while I think of better sauce.....oh no I trip on my shoeraces and chicken fall into my strawberry pie....wha...waaa...wait. GREAT IDEA! 
I wanna be in the chef's meeting for that. I mean really....were they having Marie Calendar's Strawberry Pie when that happened? I dunno who orders it. But whatever floats your boat. Ok the crab rangoons...Why are they double wrapped with so much wanton wrapper like they're gonna get an std? I mean seriously CRUNCH CRUNCH plus a liddo bit of crab.....Ok for really for what it is....this place is ok. It's fast chinese american food. The food isn't handled with love. It's like a short order cook dream. Lunch specials for the corporate guy/girl on the go. It's inexpensive. For what it is...eh. Give me panda... BTW Uhm yea it was a 3. But minus 1 for STRAWBERRY CHICKEN? WTF?"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. I got honey walnut shrimp and shrimp pad Thai! I'm really happy with the quality and the prices and the results. See picture."}
{"text":"excellent hot and sour soup is a good measure ofa chinese restaurant.   the soup was great, entree xcellent.   will come back"}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup could have been a lot better. It was mostly vinegar. There were no spiciness to it."}
{"text":"I've ordered in and had it delivered many times from here.  It's a good little place and the prices are great.  Hunan Beef is my favorite (add extra spicey)"}
{"text":"We went here a few wks ago and decided to try the Thai this time around.  my bf ordered the Beef Spicy Pad Thai and he liked it - finished it off. I went with the Pad See Ewe (beef) .. delicious. spicy and good. Yes I had leftovers even with my bf and mom picking from my plate. It was great. It was exactly what I wanted. but mostly more noodles than meat. 
My mom ordered the Kung Pao Triple. Shrimp, chicken, beeF, it sounded good but when it came it didnt look as appealing as it sounded on the menu. My mom enjoyed it. If we had thought about it we should have went with one of the FAMILY DINNERS... they have 3 options.. NXT TIME WE KNOW! our total was almost $40 for the 3 of us... and this is a mom and pop type place.. doesnt feel like a chain eventhough there are 2 in town. I think the family dinners sound like a better bargain considering it so easy to rack up a bigger bill than if you just ordere dthe Family dinner option and it has many things to try. 
I like this place, I'll admit is my go-to chinese/thai place in Henderson."}
{"text":"Great food! Best Chinese in north Las Vegas in my opinion. Love the menu items, wish they could deliver farther"}
{"text":"Whatever they serve for yellow curry is not yellow curry but some watered down version with carrots, potato, and chicken. Delivery was available so that gives them an star but I won't revisit. Especially with some of the great Thai places just a few miles away."}
{"text":"We found this place off the LV local rag. What was interesting was the fact that this place served Peruvian AND Chinese food. I got a real kick out of that, but truly, I was not there for Chinese. 

This is only the second experience we've had with Peruvian food, the first being at Inka Grill in Costa Mesa. I ordered lomo saltado, something I thoroughly enjoyed before and did not disappoint this time either. I remembered it being served with potatoes but asked for them to be omitted. Extremely flavorful with onions and tomatoes though the cut of beef used was not as good as IG, but it was also 5 bucks cheaper.

I was very curious the first time trying Peruvian food how it reminded me of Chinese food but now after researching  I realized that there is a HUGE Chinese presence in Peru which is reflected in the cuisine. One of the famous Peruvian dishes is chaufa which is their version of fried rice. We did not order that though.

The other dish we had was Aji Pollo which was like a very mild chicken curry. With the miracle green sauce which makes everything taste great, it was pretty good although the texture was a bit weird. But like lil guy said the green sauce wasn't as flavorful nor was it as spicy as the one at Inka Grill.

Run by a Peruvian family, the son takes the order and serves while mom and other family members are in the kitchen preparing. The place is small and has traces of Peruvian AND Chinese decorations. A hole in the wall but a gem nevertheless."}
{"text":"The BF drove by Little Dumpling and was pleasantly surprised to see a restaurant advertising Peruvian food.  After our little jaunt to Peru a couple of months ago, we wanted to see what Little Dumpling had to offer!

Little Dumpling serves two types of food - Chinese and Peruvian.  You'll find two separate menus, so it's really two restaurants in one.  And you'll definitely notice the Chinese influenced Peruvian food since there's a decent amount of Chinese immigrants in Peru.

Going for the staple, the BF ordered the Lomo Saltado ($9.95).  I decided to be a bit adventurous and went for their Cau Cau de Pollo ($9.00), which seemed like chicken in yellow curry.  The BF liked their Lomo Saltado because the french fries were still crispy and it tasted pretty good.  My chicken dish was pretty basic, and I was dumping a lot of their green sauce on there.  Both are generous orders and a bit pricey, in my opinion.  The BF asked if they served quinoa, but the waiter looked at us like he didn't know what we were talking about.  Oh well.  I figure we better not ask if they serve cuy or alpaca either then!

The cool thing is that they serve Inca Cola!  It comes in cans though, but will bring you straight back to Peru when you get a taste of this sweet yellow stuff.

Service is pretty slow.  It was a weekday around dinner time.  They had one customer finishing up and had a few people come in for to go orders.  We had to ask the waiter a couple of times for a take out box for our leftovers, and it took him awhile to get these.  (We were in rush 'cuz I had a flight to catch!)

Overall, it satisfied our curiosity about what Little Dumpling was serving up.  Their Peruvian menu isn't in English, so good luck with that.  Maybe their ceviche might be worth checking out?

(Pics of our beef and chicken dishes are posted on their business profile!)"}
{"text":"Pineapple curry was really good!  I got a 7 out of 10 as far as heat, and it was just a slight tingle to enhance flavor but not a serious spice. Will bump up to 8 next time. Most Thai places I go to don't even have it, so this is going to be my got to Thai place.  

Service was fast and friendly; despite a slight language barrier.  Good food, good tea.  It's been over a month since came in here so I can't remember too many specifics.  I just realized I hadn't left a review and I felt like I should since I liked this place so much.

*Went back again.  Just realized that they don't spice their curry at all if you don't make it a point to tell them to. Came out really bland, I asked them and they brought me a cup full of the spices they use. Problem solved"}
{"text":"Ok, so strip mall Chinese is always a coin toss.  Do you or don't you.  Yelp reviews were more positive than negative so we gave it a try. Very good. Plastic forks and styrofoam plates.  But who cares.  They can't be dirty then.  So much food and fast service.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"It is what it is- not anything great but okay when you need food and I think there are very hit and miss with the menu.

Got delivery-  The salt pepper pork chops were decent , strawberry chicken is kinda weird idea to begin with but could be done right- it was sweet sour sauce with sliced strawberries thrown in....not really good. Eggrolls- okay but slightly too oily, shouldve been patted out thoroughly so they'd be crunchier.

2nd time to deliver- Was really sick and can barely get up to cook....
Fried tofu- yuck. It's tofu pieces battered and was too lightly fried that the batter didn't crisp enough. Also why even batter it? Tofu fried gets crisp on its own. I thought it was a no fail dish but apparently a big fail.

Tom yung goong- cleared up my sinus but not too spicy. It was good but not great. Needs more lemongrass perhaps and kefir leaf. Other than shrimp, it had bamboo shoots and regular sliced button mushrooms (not straw ones like in most Thai) and no cilantro in it. 

I guess it's hit and miss and the hits are just okay. NW just doesn't seem to have decent Chinese takeout- it's a growing area so fingers crossed for something tasty. Maybe eating in is better. For now, I think I will reserve my Chinese eating for when I am actually in Chinatown area."}
{"text":"Worst spare ribs we've ever had. Didn't bother to bring them home. Can't remember what else we ordered, but those ribs blah"}
{"text":"We have been here 2 times in the past month. Contrary to a lot of reviews, we find it delicious. The fried rice is very good. I love the egg drop soup. 
The egg rolls are not my favorite and the chicken wings were very tasty but very very greasy."}
{"text":"The pork egg foo yung is gross! I've had this from other restaurants and it was good. This is like some kind of cake! The only egg is in the bread used. It's absolutely disgusting!  This is the second time I've ordered and the 2nd disappointment.  They need real Chinese chefs to help them out. This is like eating a crab cake with no crab. I'm not sure I'll give a third try."}
{"text":"I have never set food in the restaurant but this is my location for delivery. First off, get their General's chicken. The picky preschooler loves it and she hated everything. 

Egg rolls are good as well as their super strong Thai iced tea. It's not as sweet as others, but I still like it. Fried rice, you will receive pounds of it. They don't skimp on rice.

Delivery is slow and can take up to an hour to hour and a half but the food is good. Just don't order hungry or you'll be on a hunger rampage by the time it gets there."}
{"text":"So far this is probably the best chinese take-out place I've found in the area. You get TONS of food & rice for the money (hint: If getting food for yourself only, get a small). I've had their General Tso's, Teriyaki, and Lemon Chicken dishes so far and have enjoyed all of them. Prices are great as well.

The gal at the front desk is funny. Seems like she's always in a rush, but is perfectly nice. I like people who have a sense of urgency, so I really don't mind at all. It's nice that she always overestimates the amount of time it'll take to finish your meal so you're never disappointed.

Not quite five star flavor, but you wouldn't expect that from this type of establishment either. Still I think you get more than what you pay for."}
{"text":"While we were eating I thought the food was good and the prices were reasonable but within a few hours I started to feel really sick. Everyone in my group had rumbling stomachs and didn't feel good for the rest of the day. We all got different meals so it couldn't be just one thing that was bad. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Local neighborhood joint. Nothing fancy, but really yummy. WonTon soup is my favorite. Ate it for a week straight when I was sick. So good. Really fresh. Nice people. I'd definitely say you need to try."}
{"text":"Huge portions ! Order the combo, total bang for your buck! 

I ordered the shrimp chow mein combo with hot noodle soup and a plate of shrimp and asparagus. Above average Chinese food !

Note: if you order from the combo they charge you an extra $2 to change from chicken to shrimp.. (should have mentioned that)"}
{"text":"Simply wonderful! The menu is extensive, the staff are very friendly and responsive. The prices were EXTREMELY reasonable. This is as god as it gets. Truly, a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"Came in starving, left satisfied and still had a lot of food left over. I ordered the orange chicken, egg fried rice, and beef chow mien. SO GOOD  I'm definitely coming back. Their prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. Dine in!"}
{"text":"The only good food I find here is their egg drop soup with corn.  This is really yummy.  The corn gives it a sweet add to it.  The spring roll was decent and taste like any other.  I had the Mongolian Beef and I did not like it at all.  The rice was gross, and the meat had a weird after taste to it.  

I'll only come here for the soup and vegetable spring roll."}
{"text":"For the price the food is excellent. Love the Green curry. Rad Na is excellent. service is good."}
{"text":"Lemon chicken, I just can't get enough. A+ Service and the food is always made fresh. Very clean restaurant. Prices are very affordable. The only downside to this restaurant is it is located next to a hookah smoke shop so the smell comes in when people hold the door open :( other than that this Little Dumpling location is the spot!!"}
{"text":"Just had this tonight and everything was delicious. We ordered orange chicken, General Tso chicken, chow mein, fried rice, pot stickers, wontons, and fried sugar donuts. Everything was perfect. Ordering online was easy and they have great online coupons to add free items. Really good prices too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I am a Pad Thai fiend.

Thankfully this place has some pretty good chicken Pad Thai for a decent price that satisfies my cravings. 

The lunch special comes with a couple of sides but if you're doing take out unfortunately you have to pay extra for soup. 

Their portions are big and taste is totally there. I'd recommend getting a 5-6 on the spice scale. It's a happy medium where the heat doesn't overpower the taste.

Little Dumpling definitely does the trick!"}
{"text":"The other night we set out to have a dinner that was a little bit different than what we were eating up until that point. It was about 9pm on a Sunday night when we embarked on this endeavor and what we settled for was Little Dumpling. 

We ordered six dishes: Mongolian Beef, Thai Green Chicken Curry, Szechwan Eggplant, Honey Walnut Shrimp, Pan Fried Noodles, and Pot Stickers.

Overall the consensus was that we didn't really have anything great. Everything was just kind of ok. The Mongolian beef wasn't too hot and the eggplant was a little undercooked. What I think really didn't get us off on the right foot was the fact that when they brought our plates and table settings was that they gave us silverware instead of chopsticks. Now this wasn't a big deal for me because I don't use chopsticks, but for some of the members in my party it was because they're Asian and they expected chopsticks from a Chinese restaurant. 

Overall, decent Chinese food."}
{"text":"Fucking horrible,  being from both LA and NYC.  I think folks standards of food is way too low.  Like giving 5 stars to in and out burger.

This place is gross.  I ordered 3 things in an attempt to not go wrong.
#1 Chicken wings
#2 Chicken pad thai
#3 Mooshoo Shrimp 

ALL BAD!
The chicken wings are battered in bisquik,  WHY!?  what for?  I'm not saying not to season fried chicken but no asian joint makes wings that come out looking like fried oreos from a carnival.   

The chicken pad thai,  I hate when restaurants don't soak the noodles long enough so they come out undercooked.  The sauce used tasted like Mcdonlads BBQ sauce and they breaded the chicken.  So literally its like a rice based fettuccine with BBq sauce and chicken nuggets.
Instead of traditional sprouts it came with iceberg lettuce and carrots?  just WTF!

The moo shoo , comes in beef chicken or shrimp.  NO PORK which is traditionally what it should be was dripping wet with sauce and came with more sauce on the side.

We took two bites of everything and asked for the check.
I can't stand businesses who will ask you if you want a box to go but not ask you what's wrong if you choose to say no thanks with 80% full dishes.   So I really don't give a rats ass if they gave me service with a smile.  That smile is on auto pilot,  if they really cared, they'd ask me how come I'm wasting all this food.

I actually thought the decor was rather nice and being there was other patrons I thought ot myself how bad could this place be?   WRONG!  WRONG! WRONG!

There is a reason shitty places like these are not in china town, because they wouldn't last a day against real competition.   

Bottom line,  if you're in the mood for anything asian, get your butt to china town.  Otherwise you're better off getting pizza or chipotle across the street.   Holy hell this place was gross."}
{"text":"Been going here for years! They recently updated their menu so there is some new stuff. They have great food at great prices especially compared to some of the other Chinese take-out places in the Henderson area. Service is always friendly too and when you order in person you never have to wait too long. Their shrimp fried rice is my favorite! I also like their Buddah's delight as well if you're not a meat-eater. Another plus is that they have Thai tea with boba! So definitely check this place out if you're craving Chinese food. :)"}
{"text":"Wow... worst lemon chicken I have ever experienced. How hard is it to get fried chicken and sugar sauce right? The lemon glaze tasted like it was reheated and had grease remnants in it. 

Too much oil in the rice. At least the soup was edible."}
{"text":"Quite a bit for the meh food. I've never had egg flower soup that had a gel consistency. Some of the meal was really hot and some just warm. 
 The service was not very good. She was friendly but it seemed like she was unsure of herself. I did tip but not the percentage I normally would. I left 10% and normally I would leave at least 20.
Won't be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service! Waited an hour and a half for delivery. Called and they said the driver left 30 mins ago. I am only 1 mile from them. Called again and they said they would call the driver. Waited 15 more mins and called back to cancel the order. They just said ok and hung up. Will never order from this place again. Don't waste your time unless you don't really want to eat."}
{"text":"We always get their lunch specials which always come with sooo much! Really like  their panang curry. We always come back for it! Lemon & sesame chicken are pretty good as well. Their pad se ew was \"okay\". It was kind of dry."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years & I am glad they haven't changed their orange chicken recipe to the same ol tasting orange chicken every other restaurant has. Their orange chicken is always crispy with a hard to beat sauce with real orange peels. Idc what anyone else has to say about it...we love it cause it's different from anything else we've tasted! Good fried rice, lunch, and dinner specials as well. Everything is cooked fresh & employees are always nice, although sometimes you can feel the tension between them."}
{"text":"Have I just had bad luck lately?

I've always been a fan of this place. No, its never been exceptional, but its cheap delivery Chinese and the pad thai is decent. About 2 weeks ago, the food was unedible goo... My wife and I threw our entire portions away. I called to complain only to be told that they dont offer refunds - just a \"credit for next time\". No thanks."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on Saturday and sheesh, why did I not look at the reviews? I suppose because it is very close to my house, I ignored the warnings and had to see for myself. I ordered salt and pepper pork chops that were absolutely rancid... disgusting smelly and looked like they had decayed. The fried rice I ordered was mushy, like it had been previously made and stored then scooped out. Honey glazed walnut shrimp were floating in waht looked like milk, the breading all soggy and flavorless. After one bite of the pork chops they were thrown away, I'm pretty sure I could have gotten sick from those. Stay away! Save yourself!"}
{"text":"The restaurant's interior looks more upscale than the menu. The food is your basic Chinese food with some additional Thai options, unfortunately no pad see ew though. The service was adequate for a Saturday night at 8pm on Nascar weekend. I ordered the chicken with asparagus in black bean sauce. The hubby had the orange chicken dinner combo. We both got the hot and sour soup which was delicious! My order came out wrong, it was more like chicken with bell pepper in black bean sauce without any asparagus whatsoever. It also came out about 10 minutes before the hubby's food came out. I asked the waiter where the asparagus was and he quickly whisked away my plate and came back a few minutes later with asparagus in the place of the bell pepper, although I still found one hidden in there. I should have left it the way it was because my new entree had that burnt flavor to it, like they cooked it too fast over too high of heat. Anyway, all in all it wasn't horrible food. The orange chicken was good and soup as well."}
{"text":"It's not amazing,  but it isn't horrible either.  They have a pretty good lunch special,  and my girls seem to like the food here, I think it has to do that it's so close Target and I always take them to buy a toy afterwards.  Lol."}
{"text":"4 stars for cleanliness and decent food. I wouldn't call it authentic Chinese food, but for the price, it's well worth a visit. You dine on plastic utensils, but at least you don't have to worry about baked on food on your utensils or lipstick stains on your tea cup. The place is always clean, organized and the owner (and her daughter) are usually very nice and friendly.

Lunch plates are served daily (even the weekends) for less than $6 and it comes with soup, egg rolls and entree with rice. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times but not in a while...ordered recently online and got pad Thai, chow fun, dinner combo orange chicken. Portion size was better than average and taste was good!  Awesome improvement than what I remember in the past.  Delivery took 1 hour which was ok - delivery charge was $4 a little steep but what we saved on time/gas was fine.  Overall pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried to order from this place for the first time, after we got done ordering and he took our payment, he tried to tell us that the charge didnt go through. So we checked our bank account and sure enough the charge went through and was taken out of our account. The guy i talked to insisted that the charge didnt go through and they wanted to run my card again which i wasnt going to let happen being my account was charged. Needless to say we didnt get our food, because they wanted to charge again.. and also dont have our money back in the account. NOT EVER ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN! RUDE RUDE RUDE! TERRIBLE STAFF! Absolutely disgusted with the service."}
{"text":"I don't eat Chinese/Thai food the way it is traditionally prepared, I get steamed meat and vegetables with no added flavoring. A fairly simple dish but it is surprising how many restaurants cannot get it right. Well, this place did. The meat to veg ratio was more then fair. It was fresh and hot. I did get it paired with brown rice which was a little soggy but still very edible. I also like that this place packs the food to go in traditional Chinese/Thai food paper containers and NOT that irritating styrofoam!  Staff is friendly and orders are completed rather quickly. Inside the restaurant was clean but you cannot see any part of the kitchen from the order counter so I can't speak for the kitchen or its employees working back there."}
{"text":"The lady on the phone was so RUDE. I was placing my order and she was rude for no reason at all. I gave her my card number over the phone and i felt like i may have made a mistake so i asked her to repeat it to me. She sighed and said ill call you back if its wrong and before i finished my sentence to ask if she had my number she hung up on me. 2 min later she calls back and i cancelled my order."}
{"text":"Friendly phone service.  On time pick up. Food was better than many fast food Chinese places, but similar in many ways.  Convenient location so I will return."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese restaurant responded to our previous posting! We had their delicious spare ribs and YES this time they had wet naps to clean our messyfingers"}
{"text":"The food is super greasy. You can see the oil on the table if you spill rice on the table. The orange chicken has so much sugar that when we put the chicken in the refrigerator, the next day you can see the sugar crystals in the sauce. I get heartburn after eating here."}
{"text":"The people that work there seem really nice but the food just seems super plain Jane. We live nearby and wanted Chinese so though we would try this place for ourselves. I ordered the lemon chicken and it didn't seem to have a lemon taste at all. Just a yellow glaze over the chicken that didn't really taste like much at all. We also got the chicken chow mien noodles and again, really bland. They do offer free food when you order over a certain amount. Which was nice. We chose the egg rolls and they were good. The restaurant looked nice and clean inside. To be honest even though this place is not anything to rave about, if you have a a long day and just want something quick and easy I could see us coming back to try something different. But we won't be regulars."}
{"text":"Huge portions for the price and some items we had never seen before. My small cup of wonton soup for $3.50 was easily enough for 2 people. It was full of fresh veggies and pieces of pork, with 3 large wontons. We ordered a noodle dish that had yellow curry on it with lots of big shrimp. Service was very prompt. Boba tea was just right, not too sweet. I ordered a cup of hot tea and I was excited to see it was a Jasmine green tea from an Asian brand that I had never seen before. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My Grandma was looking for a good Chinese take-out place nearby, so we checked out this place, based on the Yelp! reviews. My Grandma got the Lemon Chicken and really enjoyed it. I ordered the Panang Curry with Chicken. I asked them to make it hot (9 of 10). I didn't really like the taste, it wasn't very hot & the consistency was strange. I've had Panang at several restaurants & this was some of the worst, unfortunately. The service was adequate, so I'll probably try it again, but I'll be ordering something else instead."}
{"text":"I ordered the sweet and sour chicken...i had to throw it away. The chicken was not edible. Very chewy. The egg roll was not cooked all the way. Just mush. I wont be back. Alot of negative reviews about little dumpling. Go somewhere eles. I hope i dont get sick."}
{"text":"Like a previous writer said, used to be much better under previous ownership.  I'm a regular here (4 times a month on average) and i've noticed the service and quality isn't what it used to be.  I usually order the hot & spicy chicken.  The order i had last night wasn't good and their was nothing spicy about it.  To make matters worse, I always order and pay online through Eat 24.  Last night I went to pick up my order and was charged again for my food.  When I explained I already paid online, the guy insisted I had not.  Their was a language barrier so I did not want to argue with the guy so I paid for the food again.  Then had to go home and spend 20 minutes on the phone with eat 24 to get my charges reversed.  Looks like i will be looking for a new place in Henderson for Thai food.  Too bad cause I really liked this place."}
{"text":"Casual, pleasant dining experience. Great presentation and exceptional flavor of the food we ordered. Was very satisfied with the quality and quantity of each dish. This based on three dine-in meals plus one delivery."}
{"text":"Fantastic friendly service. Very authentic flavor come thru their food. This is a great chines restaurant on the NW/N side (centenial hills). The egg flour and bean curd soups are freshly made with obvious care, not in bulk and sitting in the kitchen for hours!"}
{"text":"Okay - why the 4 stars??

I am not rating a place by fine cuisine standards, but more about what it is.  This place is a neighborhood chinese joint.  So it should be cheap, convenient and serve the standards in large portions.

This place did fill me expectations of a simple little chinese place.  They had some good deals on lunch specials.  Pretty much everything was $5.99!  Comes with the soup and the crunchy wonton things.  

The place was nice inside.  It was kinda dark in there but it was ok.  The service was great.  I ordered hot tea and she must have brought 4 tea pots.  I was there for awhile talking with someone and the waitress was rather convivial.  

The food.  Like I said before - the standards.  Nothing to blow my skirt up, but I good lunch on the cheap.  I wasn't expecting culinary greatness just some decent chinese food.

Yes 4 stars - A clean, comfortable, good service, standard chinese food at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"We had the Orange Chicken, the sweet n sour chicken, Pad Thai, dinners specials  and some sauce added to kick it up a notch.

We decided to eat here on a whim just because..well the Yelp reviews looked appealing...

The food arrived in a timely manner, the delivery guy was cool. So we tipped him well. :-) fast forward to opening the bag, and wham! Guess what we found? A damn mess! Thinking of starting a hashtag with #littledump  as a result. 

It was like going to work ER at the emergency room. The containers were all heavily sauced as they had been thrown around like basketballs. Check out the pictures of the attempted triage of the nasty situation here if you want. 

This was outrageous and we really thought that people should know what they're getting to go from here.

We called and let them know and they acted at first like it was no biggie and said thanks for calling. Then later called to offer 10% off the next order. Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"This review applies to the Little Dumpling located at 6572 N. Decatur only.
My wife and I went here having previously eaten, very happily, at the Little Dumpling at 6430 Sky Point.
My first clue that I was going to be disappointed came when reviewing photos posted on Yelp by others. One picture showed the Pad Thai swimming in a reddish sauce. Well, we both ordered it anyway. We ordered pan fried dumplings to start. The meat was under seasoned and absolutely underwhelming, but edible.
The (chicken) pad thai was a major disappointment. The noodles, chicken, and nuts were fine, the bean sprouts that I expected were not present but cabbage and carrots were. All of this was literally swimming in a reddish colored, very sweet, orange flavored sauce. My wife couldn't eat hers. I ate mine and frankly, it wasn't terrible, but it was certainly not what I expected.  Add to that the submerged chunks of unknown matter in my water glass with the lipstick covered tea cup....... Thats a wrap! We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Little Dumpling is like my comfort zone.
Soup, eggrolls, broccoli, rice, maybe another dish or two... so delicious and hits the spot every time.
We order through Eat24 right from Yelp app and food is ready to pick up within 10 minutes.
Order is always right and makes my stomach so happy."}
{"text":"I live Thai food and tired this place for to go few times but had the same ok experience.
I have tired lot of Thai restaurant in Vegas but this is not the best one .  The curry we had was the worst flavor ever.
Pad see noodle was good
Tired this few time since its closet place to my home"}
{"text":"Meh. Used to eat here years ago and it was much better. BBQ pork fried rice had an off taste. Beef (from beef and broccoli) was chewy. Egg roll was good I guess. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"I've been in Vegas for 4 yrs now, and I've been trying to find a good Thai restaurant. Well this weekend I found it! For the price you get at least 2 meals in one. I'll be eating at Little Dumpling again. Yum!!"}
{"text":"This was an awesome find! We came in craving Chinese, and left wanting them to open a location in Reno. The staff is beyond friendly and they have the food to entice you to come back again and again. We had the Mongolian beef, which was well balanced with still crisp well-cooked onions, the generals chicken, which had pineapple in to balance the heat, orange chicken which was perfectly cooked and well sauced, and the pineapple fried rice- which was fresh and tasty. 
Can't wait to visit again to explore the menu further! Thank you for being so welcoming and kind!
*also the spicy mustard was home made and AMAZING"}
{"text":"Ordered shrimp fried rice and pad Thai being African American I asked if which was more popular as Thai food is made different at every restaurant  the gentlemen in the front couldn't even answer the question"}
{"text":"Went for the first time today and it won't be the last time. Food was amazing and the service was on point. We will be goin back there again."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 4 Stars
The front of the restaurant was well kept, but the glass to the kitchen was obscured to keep out patrons. I always like to see a restaurant confident enough to display their kitchen. But what I haven't seen is a kitchen bold enough to install glass for viewing the kitchen just to later obscure the glass from viewing. Interesting

Hospitality: 3 stars
The staff was attentive and polite but spoke very little English. When ordering our food didn't come out accurate. They quickly apologized and corrected the meal.

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are very large, the vegetables came out crispy and fresh. All entrees were tasty and hot. The appetizer was smaller than anticipated but the dinner portions were very large.

Overall:
This place is great for a \"quick sit down\" meal and for carry out but not for a dress up date night."}
{"text":"Gross!! I tried it cuz I woke across the street but OMG... dry ass food... I wanted to puke!!"}
{"text":"Very good! Pleasantly surprised because it is hard to find a Asian restaurant that has good food. We ordered the pan fried dumplings, steamed shrimp dumplings, chicken on a stick (tender & marinated nicely), wonton soup with lots of nice wontons, great broth and vegetables, hot n sour soup & vegetables was very good! Then, chicken with string beans, lots of sliced chicken, string beans were cooked perfectly and shrimp egg foo young, had lots of shrimp in sauce, patties were ok, sesame chicken (asked if I could get white meat, no problem, wasn't charged extra either), sauce was also delicious, plus they gave us a free order of extra large pork fried rice. I really and my family were very pleasantly surprised that everything we ordered was delicious! No problems with any of the dishes! Had all the condiments included! Definitely will be ordering from Little Dumpling again! Thanks!
Ordered second time and everything is delicious and still get 4 stars from us!"}
{"text":"It's not exactly 100% authentic, but sometimes that's exactly what you're looking for:).  This is my go-to for Chinese takeout.  Delicious, fast, and a great value for what you get. It's kind of hidden in a strip mall, but worth the search once you're there."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Tomatoes in the noodles, even the eggs in soup were rancid.  $30 food straight in the trash."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for Chinese takeout. The Thai is slightly above average. Avoid the teriyaki as it's pretty plain. Prices are cheap and the staff is friendly. Too bad it's smack dab in the middle of my commute. Here's a tip though, their delivery radius is much wider than you probably think. Call them and ask if they can deliver and you might be surprised. 

Dishes that stand out:

Walnut shrimp (I don't see it on the menu for some reason, but I order it often enough to know it exists. $9 for about 20 large shrimp!). Pork with Hot Garlic Sauce. Singapore Noodles. BBQ pork fried rice."}
{"text":"For 15 minutes.... no one cared to check on and ask if we wanted to order. It wasn't busy. Two groups of customer had their food already.... poor ,poor customer service"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, I wish I found it earlier. We got the Honey Walnut Shrimp and it was AMAZING. The only complaint was that they were 15 minutes later than they said they would be, but seriously it was a Friday night and the place was packed. Which, now I see why. They included free egg rolls and crispy things in the to go order. Very generous with the rice that they gave us. I seriously plan on making this place a regular. Way worth the price. Its tucked behind starbucks."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery service. First time was over 2 hours to arrive. The driver didn't speak English and had no clue what I was saying to him on the phone. Driver went back to the restaurant and the Manager delivered the food. 

Second time was just as bad. Same non English speaking driver and a repeat performance. It's been 90 mins and the food has still not arrived. Called the restaurant and was advised the driver is having GPS issues. I live 3 blocks from the restaurant. 

Never again. Too many choices out there to deal with this."}
{"text":"The staff is awesome first of all. Very friendly.
My husband and I love this place.
Fast delivery. Quick take out.
Shrimp and lobster soup mixed with vegetable fried rice is so good.
Crab Rangoon is awesome."}
{"text":"I haven't had fried rice this good in over a decade. The service was average but the food was outstanding. A smaller sized restaurant but very clean and welcoming. We had mango boba, sesame chicken, chicken fried rice, and Singapore noodles. We ordered the small plate size and took home half of our order for later...enough for two plus leftovers. I will definitely be back. Take out is available too."}
{"text":"It was ok. The pineapple chicken fried rice was so gross.. The food wasn't hot and not the most flavorful. I wouldn't suggest this place."}
{"text":"They have the best pad Thai I've ever had! I didn't get it as spicy as I normally would have (I never do the first time I try a new place, just in case!) but it was still delicious. The flavor was phenomenal. I ordered through Grubhub and it arrived early, which was a bonus. They also have good coupons through Grubhub so that was great! Their house dumplings were also fantastic. I'll probably be ordering from here every week!"}
{"text":"The food's not terrible but the problem is when you order a meat dish such as Mongolian Beef you get about 5 pieces of beef and then they mask the rest of it with the onions and bell pepper so you think you're getting a big meal.  I've gotten other beef dishes there and it's the same thing.  If you like more veggies than meat then this is your place!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Little Dumpling.  Sure, it's the fast food variation of Chinese/Thai, but it wasn't bad at all.  Sure, I've had better, but for a quick and cheap Chinese/Thai fix, Little Dumpling is a definite contender."}
{"text":"Very nice little place to go. Got the dinner for 2 and you get a very good amount of food. Hot & Sour soup is on point. Finally a place that gets it right. Thick with a little bit of a kick to it. So many places make it to thin and no spice at all.
Kung Pao chicken and the beef and broccoli is very good.
Nice quite place. We will be back, cause this is now my favorite Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"We've ordered from this place several times.  Delivery is always much quicker than they estimate, which is nice...and most of the food has always been great; however, yesterday, I ordered orange chicken and the combo fried rice (lots of it) to take to a family function...and of course, on the day I want the food to be the best, it was the worst!  The orange chicken had this thick, goopy sauce on it and was covered in sugar.  It was disgusting.  The rice had a burnt taste to it, which was weird, because this rice in the past was the best ever.  I don't understand it, but was extremely disappointed.  Also, in the past, I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce.  It was gross, as it was like soup...like nothing I had ever seen before."}
{"text":"The place could use a little work but like most Chinese food places, that's what you expect.
The staff could be a lot more friendlier, I felt that I was being rushed to order even though there is nobody else waiting in line. They have a quite a few of options to choose from when it comes to dinner.
Their price is very cheap and reasonable and the portions are more than enough.

I ordered an orange chicken, it came out really well. No complaints on this dish.
However, I also ordered a beef and broccoli and the beef was very chewy. It did not taste like anything.. it was like eating gum without flavor. I do not recommend eating anything with beef here. 

Orders of 15 dollars or more gets 2 free egg rolls.
The egg rolls came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce that taste like it came out of a can. The egg rolls it self was very good. Fresh and crunchy."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken egg foo yung, sweet and sour pork, sesame chicken and beef lo mein through yelp for delivery. It took approximately 45 minutes to get to my house, which was well within the delivery window. I was absolutely amazed at the amount of food I received! Everything was absolutely delicious! Will order again."}
{"text":"Love this place. The service is so friendly. Food was delicious. It was ready so quickly after ordering! Super happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"The lo mein consisted of 95% noodles, 2% chicken, 2% cheap vegetables (celery, onions, and shredded carrots).

Like most other chinese restaurants, they stuff the food with the cheapest vegetables to cut down on costs. I was expecting more chicken, some broccoli, pea pods, water chest nuts, mushrooms, etc."}
{"text":"Love this place! Found it a few years ago when i moved into the neighborhood. I have since I left the neighborhood and still travel back to Henderson for their food. The food is always full of flavor, prepared quickly, and the staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Not good. I got the chicken satay and it's literally just chunky heated through chicken and the peanut sauce was literally peanut butter and it was frozen. Not how chicken satay is supposed to be. We also got the pot stickers and they weren't bad but didn't have much flavor and kinda tasted like pre-packaged frozen ones. Definitely overpriced for the quality. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with this restaurant.

I needed a quick dinner, researched thru yelp, called in (pickup) order for pineapple fried rice and egg flower soup. 

I arrived in 10 minutes, food was hot and ready. The special handling to make my order without peas was perfect. Restaurant and kitchen looked very clean. 

The portion was really big and enough for several people. Great deal for a few dollars.  The food was great!

I'm happy as this is very local and convenient for me,  I'll go back here again.

Ps: I did take-out this trip, but the dine in looked nice too.  They had several tables with chairs and several  booths.  (More seating than normal for a small restaurant. )"}
