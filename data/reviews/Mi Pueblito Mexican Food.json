{"text":"Looking for a fast mexican food with all the traditional flavor this is the spot. Me and my family have been going for over 7 yrs:)"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and was checking out their food menu and I looked around and saw 2 rats and had to leave out of here. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food I've ever had hands down. Their California burrito, fajitas and Carne fries are on point 100% 
Better than all the local mexican food places HANDS DOWN. So sad I had to move away from them.
Will go back tho when I can. Me and my boyfriend ate there all the time."}
{"text":"Got the mexican flavor burger. Was great, but all ingredients seemed store bought. Other than that, another good burger."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately my first take out did not leave me with the desire to return. So I won't be. 

I love Mexican food, the food I had here (Two shredded beef tacos) were really bland. The meat was very tough and difficult to chew. I'm almost certain it had been reheated once or twice. The beans tasted burnt. 

I didn't go inside so I can't speak to the atmosphere or cleanliness. I saw a woman mopping so that's good. I also liked their rice. 

I wish it was better, but first time experiences matter."}
{"text":"I hate to give local businesses bad reviews, but this place is fuckin uuuup!
Gave this place's menudo a shot while experiencing the hangover from hell on a Sunday morning. The restaurant has a beautiful menudo poster on the window. Large pieces of honeycomb tripe, fresh lime, crushed red pepper and cilantro...To a Mexican with a hangover, there is no better sight!  

So I walk inside and order a bowl, about $5, standard price. I take a seat and a few moments later, I'm greeted with a  heaping bowl of hominy and a few shitty pieces of tripe. The red chile was a deep, dark red and looked very old. Shocked that my menudo looked absolutely nothing like it did on the poster outside, I dug around in my bowl, looking for some kind of hope that I would find a mere trace of what was advertised outside. 

A few panicked spoonfuls of hominy later, I gave up and went next door to Fry's for a can of Juanita's menudo."}
{"text":"This Mexican spot is authentic and incredible. Friendly as soon as we walked in the door. We got rolled tacos and two carne asada burritos! They whipped up the carne asada fresh and the tortillas were authentic. Super delicious. 

Their green and red sauce was a little spicier than I was used to, but it was a good different and a good spicy! 

Restaurant is a small hole-in-the-wall and well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I go here atleast once a week, their shredded beef tacos are the best I've ever tasted! Sometimes the beans are too watery or burnt, but most of the time they are on delicious! I always go with the tostada or beef taco combos, and they always leave me wanting more. Definitely worth stopping by if you haven't tried it."}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time, carne asada fries....yum. Still good Although the portions have got smaller...only reason didn't give it a 5"}
{"text":"This place has very friendly customer service I very much enjoy going to this place. The carne asasa fries enough are purely amazing."}
{"text":"Worst food and service ever, we waited 30 min for 2 meals and a burrito that, by the way were burnt. Food was nasty and lady who took order was rude. Never again will I eat here."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican takeout. If I want a little more substance than fast food but don't quite have the time to head to a larger sit down place, I'll stop by for an order of 12 rolled tacos to split with my wife and/or a chorizo burrito."}
{"text":"Go here regularly and I have never been disappointed. The food is awesome and one of the best green chili burritos I have ever tasted. Only down fall is if your in a hurry it takes a bit of time since they don't make it till you order it."}
