{"text":"So glad to see Police Station Pizza in Robinson!  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly and laid back.  If you are looking for a fancy joint that serves mediocre pizza at a high price point, don't come here!  If you are looking for excellent pizza, at a reasonable price, in a relaxed setting - check them out!    Their pizza is delicious and it's worth the drive from wherever you may be coming.  My only suggestion: if you do not live close, eat the pizza there.  Don't let it get cold, it's made to be eaten right out of the oven.  Otherwise, it'll survive a 15 minute car ride home.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Police Station pizza will open in Feb 2015 at 1124 park manor blvd ROBINSON Town centre. The location will have 48 seats and offer a expanded menu. Brian looks forward in supplying you with great pizza and pasta soon."}
{"text":"It's closed. No longer open, what a disappointment........ guess  I'm heading to Ambridge for some of this great pizza now"}
{"text":"Not pleased with Police Station Pizza.  I asked for extra cheese and pepperoni on my pizza, the extra cheese was just piled on top of the pepperoni and not melted.  They just took shredded cheese and put it on top.  Who doesn't melt the cheese???? The sauce lacked flavor."}
{"text":"Been eating this pizza for years, has been consistently good the whole time! Love the contrast between the fresh ingredients and the crispy crust. This is one pizza that stands apart from the rest!"}
{"text":"The good: the crust is crunchy, light and airy. The sweet peppers were fresh and delicious. The not so good: lack of cheese, sauce taste like generic store-bought, and it took 15 minutes to get three slices of pizza. Also the slices are not very big I could easily eat five of them. Not like what I'm used to with my home town square pizza place. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Don't believe the hype."}
{"text":"The square pizza is nice a crisp on the bottom, the toppings are put on uncooked, which might sound odd, but it works, it's a can't miss if your in Ambridge."}
{"text":"Drove past and didn't see a lot of people and it was during dinner time so figured I would stop.  I walk in - not knowing what to expect and my eyes searched and searched for a menu or something being this was my first time.  Finally I see a medium size menu that is white with black lettering. It was a very generic sign and but told me what I needed to know.  There's not many signs in the restaurant.   The gentleman that took my order was nice and telling me about the pizza etc. I told him it was my first visit.   I ordered two slices with two different toppings.  It was like $4.00 and took less than five minutes to receive my slices.  I regretted not getting a drink and on my way out I noticed there was a cooler with pop in it.. no fountain drinks in this establishment.  On the road within minutes.. I take a bite of one of the pieces and I immediately noticed the dough and how it seemed old because it was kinda of hard and chewy. This dough was not by any means fresh.   I might have got a bad batch of dough maybe.    So tried the next piece and the crust and well half of the piece of pizza was hard as a rock.  I think it probably could have shattered glass.   The sauce on the pizza tastes very generic just like it was out the jar type of taste and too sweet.. and I prefer my toppings cooked!!  I felt like I was eating a frozen pizza from giant eagle. I have heard from others that you have to eat the pizza at the restaurant right away or it gets hard?   Well my first experience this is true but so not appealing to me.   What fun is that!?  What if I wanted to order out a take out pizza.   The dough did not seem fresh and it will be hard within minutes of walking out of there?!   I don't get the hype at all."}
{"text":"Came from out of town this weekend to try this pizza and waited til Monday because you are supposed to be closed on Sunday, instead you were closed on Monday. Thanks for that. You should probably update your hours online."}
{"text":"I tried this pizza today and it was amazing.  Not only was the pizza good the service was SO nice. The guys there were socializing with everyone that came in and seemed like genuine gentalmen.   The pizza is square pizza (for some that are familiar wirh dicarlos , its like that) They put the toppings on after the pizza comes out. Extra cheese is definitely EXTRA! The crust is crunchy and you buy it by the slice.   I love the location and how clean it is inside.  Like i said... they were so nice they walked the pizza out to my car because i had my baby with me.  Please try thia pizza!!! - returning customer!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is on point. If you are a true pizza connoisseur and love pizza with all your heart, you should try this place.  Its different than other pizza spots Ive been to. The slices are square sicilian cut and the crust is very light and crispy. The sauce and cheese are warm and i think cold cheese is thrown on top and starts to melt as you eat it. AMAZING. One of my top pizza spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend use to get pizza here when she tutored evenings at PTI and told me it was good. I also read favorable reviews by others from another location with the same name. I tried this place on a whim one day and thought it was good enough to return to a few times before I moved from the area.  The pizza is super cheap in my opinion. You order by the slice and the crust is thick, crispy, rectangular and at a formidable size to boot. The cheese is put on after the pizza is cooked so it keeps a crumbly/just barely warm consistency. This might be surprising if you are unaware but I thought it was great and an interesting way to do pizza.  If you want pizza by the slice that doesn't add up to a small fortune when you buy a few at a time (I'm looking at you, Pizza Sola) definitely check this place out. I guarantee you you will find their take on pizza unique; whether or not you like it is up to you."}
{"text":"Back again for more.  The pizza is just as good if not better.  They're back to accepting credit cards, which I'm pretty sure I mentioned it on my last review but just in case, haha.  One of the two partners seems to always been there.  They're always up for talking and they are always very appreciative of your business.  I think they definitely have an excellent little local gem in their hands.  Everyone should try this place out! :)"}
{"text":"Tuesday night pizza run - First time trying Police Station Pizza and man are we glad we did ! We were greeted by both gentlemen as soon as we entered the building and were eagerly given suggestions on toppings when we told them we were first timers. The pizza was ACE ( so much so I had to stop myself from getting another slice knowing good and will it would send me into a food coma ) EXCELLENT customer service , GREAT music and FANTASTIC pizza ! We will return !!"}
{"text":"I liked the pizza. It was good but needed more sauce. The bread/crust is thick enough to handle more sauce. My husband and I love square pizza so we tried this one. We both agreed, more sauce please!"}
{"text":"Moved from the old spot on top of Steubenville Pike. Pizza is still just as damn good. They put the toppings on after the crust and sauce have been baked which may seem different, but very delicious. Prices seem to have slightly increased though. One of my 3 favorite pizza joints. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Place was great, weekly visitor.   Looks closed now. Nothing left in the building? Any updates?"}
{"text":"Most authentic Italian food I've had in Pittsburgh. Growing up in an Italian neigborhood and marrying an AWESOME Italian girl, I know good food. I will stop by there every time I'm in town. They also have gluten free if needed."}
{"text":"Pizza is so good! It's crispy square cuts with chunky sauce and cheesy. The taste is fresh and not greasy."}
{"text":"Most people rave about Police Station Pizza, so I had to try it out tonight. I have to say I was quite underimpressed.   The crust was crunchy, soft, and warm just like it should be. The sauce was sweet, a bit too sweet for my liking. The cheese was thick and tasted good however it was only half cooked, maybe that's an appeal to some, but I like my good hot not cold/warm. The toppings are put on after the pizza is cooked, so it's a little different and the flavor does not get to mix with the overall taste.  The service was mediocre, the cook expected everyone in the establishment to know how to order there, if you don't know, you order by the slice and they have very limited toppings. The one lady wanted a veggie pizza and he explained, \"they don't do fancy toppings like chicken\". The food was also very slow to come out.  The location maybe the only thing to save this location, it's not in ambridge like the original location so it's much closer to pittsburgh, and there is plenty of safe parking, unlike the original location.  Overall, sure it's a place to go to try a different pizza however I don't know how many times I'll actually go out of my way to visit this shop."}
{"text":"This pizza is priced great and its good pizza. Its sold by the slice. I believe its like $1.50 a slice + more $ for toppings. I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni, my bf ordered 2 slices of pepperoni & sausage + drink. The total was like $9.50 which is awesome for 4 slices & a drink.   The dough is very airy and we were hungry So we each ordered another slice.   Great deal on pizza in Robinson. I don't think it gets much cheaper than this.   The shop was clean and modern. Staff was also nice. I'll give the pizza 3.5 stars but the price, staff and location bumps it to 4."}
{"text":"Stay away, at least for lunch. There is one guy in there now and he can't handle the traffic. Waiting 40 minutes for pizza ? REALLY. It's not that good."}
{"text":"Go in, know what you want and have cash ready. Pizza is super cheap and the dough is crunchy!"}
{"text":"Terrible pizza. Has to throw it out. Will never eat there again. As soon as the pizza crust cooled down  it turned hard as a rock. Couldn't take a bite out without losing a tooth."}
{"text":"This is how passionate I am about this place: I literally just finished scarfing down three pizza slices and got up to write a review. Background: I'm not from 'round these parts.  On a business trip to Pittsburgh (the second time I've been in the city and the first time I've been on my own) I had no idea where to go for dinner. Being a little on the south side (Green Tree) area, I decided Yelp was my best answer to avoid chain after chain after chain restaurant. If there had been photos of Police Station Pizza online I might not have gone. It *is* a hole in the wall but I find that these are some of the best places.  Like Jake says this is not your average pizza. Most people expect pizza to be NY or Chicago style crust, sauced, topped and cooked. At Police Station Pizza they warm up some pizza on a thick, foccacia style bread, and then top it for you with whatever you want. However, they don't have exotic food here. So when Brian asked me what I wanted I said pepperoni and pineapple he cut me off to say pineapple was too exotic for them! Well, after that I just said give me three slices - your favorite, one I have to try, and one that's unique to the area. I ended up with plain, sausage, and peppers (hot and banana) in that order.   Unfortunately I got pretty effing lost between the pizza place and the beer store (damn your Puritan laws Pittsburgh!) and the hotel. So by the time I got back to the hotel the pizza was lukewarm at its best but my stomach was grumbling and didn't care. I imagine the pizza is a helluva a lot better hot but even lukewarm it was pretty damn good. The sausage isn't too salty and not really spicy which I liked. Sometimes I find that ground sausage at pizza places comes across as super salty & spicy. The pepper pizza slice was unique and I might try them again on a NY thin crust style and, well, by the time I finished those two slices all the toppings had fallen on to my plain making it...unplain.   So 3 slices, $5.25 total, and ready within minutes. For the ability to get pizza by the slice by some nice, local guys, I totally recommend Police Station Pizza. For the best pizza you've ever had in your life? This isn't the place.  EXTREME NOTE: Cards are not accepted here. Bring cash or forfeit fees at the ATM at the convenience store next door."}
{"text":"I guess being spoiled in growing up with good pizza most of my life most pizza places fall short, police station is another on the list while the price is good per cut why do pizza places think raw uncooked cheese is what people want on their pizza?"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a Facebook page. I was in the area so I thought I'd give it a try. First things first, the customer service was not great. There were 2 guys working. The younger guy never said a word to me, even when he handed me my food. The other guy who was older & running the show, wasn't very friendly. I wasn't eating there so I brushed it off. Just more of an observation.  I tried a cut with pepperoni & a cut with mushroom. I had a thought while I was watching them finish the cuts, & when I opened up the box I was right. Their pizza is just like Betos Pizza. The crust had a similar texture. The sauce was a little bland. One noticeable difference is that this place skimps on the cheese.  Overall, not bad pizza, but not as good as Betos."}
{"text":"Police station pizza moved to Robinson. Amount of toppings decreased!  Quality is lacking from old location!  Price increase!  Place not really worth visiting with the price increase and toppings decrease!  Nothing special! Now OVERPRICED AND NOT WORTH THE TIME, WITH SMALL AMOUNT OF TOPPINGS!  ALSO OVERPRICED, BOTTLED SODA!  Should be out of business soon, as quality isn't worth the price.  They tried to go big to soon. Was great a a family place in old location!"}
{"text":"Very very good pizza. About a buck per slice. You can't beat the awesome taste and that price. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The pizza is awesome, and so is the customer service!! I always stop by when I'm in Robinson for a few slices. I'm a sucker for the Ohio valley style pizza with cold cheese, and they definitely do it right here!"}
{"text":"Good place if you like obnoxious owner and heartburn pizza. Yuk . Go to chain pizza shops. Not worth the trip. Should stay in Ambridge"}
{"text":"Ok... I have no clue why this pizza gets good reviews. The sauce is too sweet for the over all lack of cheese. The sauce tastes like it came of a bottle of cheap pizza sauce. On that note even my toppings felt only semi cooked because they were put on after the pizza was made. This is the worst pizza I have had in Pittsburgh. Actually the worst pizza I have ever had outside of a rest area. I have have been here 2x and thought maybe that the 1st time was just a fluke. Nope... The 2nd time was exactly the same. I will not be returning to this place. Price is the only reason this places gets 2 stars. If the pizza was not as cheap as it was simply one start would be given.   Update- looks like I was contacted by someone named Brian who has a profile photo of the Police pizza logo that called me names and said my taste buds were wrong. Now he didn't directly say they were wrong but that I was wrong in my review and looking to harm the business. Sorry but the pizza is just bad. I can not help that at all."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. I had an appointment next door and thought I would just grab a slice. It was delicious! I love thick crust pizza and hate greasy pizza. I usually need several paper towels to dab off the grease, but I didn't need a single one! I'm so excited to have a quick place to stop when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Yeh, it is only $1 a slice but!!!!!!! Crust like thin burnt toast! Cold cheese on top! Forgetaboutit!"}
{"text":"Have you been to Betos? It's hit or miss with people. With me, it's a miss, and Police Station Pizza is an even bigger miss.  The draw to this place is that they put the toppings on after the pizza comes out of the oven. Some like it. My issue with this place isn't so much that I'm a meaty cheese kind of girl...it just wasn't good. The bread tasted stale with no flavor, the sauce was basically canned tomato sauce, and my biggest hang up with PSP is the amount of waste they create with their packaging. Every order is served in a cardboard box. We dined in and had 2 slices each- and had to throw these giant boxes into the trash. No trees being spared over here.  The inside could use some updating, too. Handwritten signs, etc. just not very appealing.  Two stars because the folks that were working there were very nice and explained everything well. Nice people, low quality product."}
{"text":"26 dollars for 16 small cuts of pizza,it tasted okay but not 26 dollar good,must have to pay the rent! Won't be going back there"}
