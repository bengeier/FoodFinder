{"text":"The Silver Spartan is run by a bunch of college kids. And for a college diner, I wouldn't expect it to be perfect. However, this one is pulling it.

I went into the Silver Spartan to order a simple BLTC sandwich. Waiting at the counter for the waitress to finish getting orders from two other hungry people, two students walked right in and sat next to me at the counter. The waitress then proceeded to finish with taking the others orders, and was on her way to take mine. Except, she didn't. She stopped and took the other two people's orders, some obnoxious college kids who seemed only to talk about sex and Star Wars. I waited for her to take their orders, which concidentally were the same as mine. She served them drinks, and finally, after ten minutes of waiting, she took mine. I ordered a BLTC, and it took about 20 more minutes of waiting to finally fulfill my order. The worst part was that the food took so long to cook because the chef's were clearly unexperienced. A BLTC should take about 5 minutes. However, the chef's took so long to cook the other people's orders that mine had to wait. Haven't they heard of multitasking? This was just way too much for me. 30 minutes of waiting for a simple sandwich is too much. And they expect a tip from this? Fat chance. I'm sorry, but it wasn't even late at night or early in the morning. It was six in the afternoon. 

Service is horrible, and it needs to improve. I vote they fire all the college kids (no joke) and hire people who know what they're doing."}
{"text":"I've never really had a good experience here. I had a friend who worked here and it stole her life. It takes an hour to get a milkshake and that's the only attraction here. Seriously, the only good thing is the cheap shake deal they were running for awhile. I'm not sure if it's still around though. 

I hear they're changing it into a Denny's branch of some sort with only a select amount of options on the menu. Perhaps this will be an improvement. I'm hoping so, because this could be such a cute/nice little diner on campus. It's really disappointing that after a handful of management changes since I've been going to school here, nothing has changed or improved. Service is the slowest ever, pretty much, and the food is way sub-par. They could have even benefitted from just being a milkshake bar and not even bothering with the food aspect. Install more equipment and just crank those shakes out for the drunk kids. It would be perfect!"}
{"text":"My coronary arteries feel like slimy. It reminded me of a Denny's (on par with McD except with a larger helping of human despair). 

I hate making bad bad jokes, but I'm seriously traumatized and not in my right mind. Sorry Celine, my heart will not go on. Not after this. 

Imagine. An oval plate. A pasty yellow omelette. Some sort of filling (I'm guessing cheese), a decorative scattering of bell peppers and sausage. Just enough to insinuate a meal worth $6.00. A pasty, unbuttered English muffin (how the FUCK do you get an English muffin wrong?!) A small slice of cantaloupe peeking from beneath the carefully placed omelette and hash browns. I love warm fruit. 

And the hash browns. Goodie. I imagine that the cook shredded up some taters, microwaved them until tender, then gargled some melted lard in his mouth, shoveled a handful of the taters into his pie-hole, then *bleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaah* onto the plate in one slimy globule. It glistened in the glinting sunlight. So beautiful. 

After my meal was finished (Yes, all of it. I was hungry dammit), the plate looked cancerous with yellowish growths smattered around the decorative lettuce leaf. 

Wash it down. Wash it down with coffee...."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food.  This place keeps changing management, but for some reason it never gets better!  If it weren't for 99 cent milkshakes, this would be a one star place.  ONLY go there for that.

If you want to eat there, plan on waiting way too long and getting terrible food.  I once ordered a basic breakfast and they managed to screw it up!  The eggs and the toast were cold when I got it and the hashbrowns were warm.  Didn't their mommies teach them how to time a simple breakfast?

Once we got seated and we waited for half an hour without getting a darn menu.

I'm not asking for all that much.  I'd just like some decent food on campus.  I hope someone eventually picks up this diner and turns it into something worth going to."}
{"text":"Don't believe the negative reviews. This place is so much fun. How could you possible complain about 99 cent milkshakes?"}
{"text":"Ugh. I'm sad to report all of the previous reviews are spot on with this place and I'm still kicking myself for not consulting Yelp before our visit....

I knew of this place only because it was tucked next to the great L'Albatros on Bellflower. That is where the similarities between the two restaurants begin and end.

On a recent trip to the CMA, we were looking for a place to stop afterwards for a quick lunch. 

\"Hey, isn't that one groovy looking silver diner nearby? Want to try that,\" I asked. \"I love diners!\" Those were my famous last words. 

Upon our entrance I ordered a coffee, which was bland and watered down and apparently refills are hard to come by as I sat with an empty cup the rest of my meal. My lovely wife ordered the chili mac and a milkshake. The \"famous\" milkshake, as proclaimed on the menu tasted like ice cream + Hershey's syrup. If that's what they consider \"famous\", call me Charlie Bucket, because I've been whipping up better since I was 4-years old! The chili mac consisted of a sloppy hunk of  cold cheesy macaroni with canned chili scattered along the outside of the bowl. If first impressions count for anything, I could tell she was regretting this choice by first sight. After the initial bite, she was practically in tears. It was that bad. 

As for me, I ordered the burger. Diners usually have decent burgers, right? Let's just say, this might've been the worst burger I've ever had. Ever! Dry, tasteless, served with rotten tomatoes and lettuce. Don't ask for cheese either, because that's not an option. It was 3:30pm and we had a long day with a small breakfast and no lunch. We were starving, yet  we still couldn't find it in ourselves to take more than two bites of this disaster on a plate we were served.  We politely asked for our checks and left. 

We ended up at Guy's Pizza in Coventry for $1 slices to get the disgusting Silver Spartan taste out of our mouths. Wow, this place is bad!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place I've ever eaten at. All I ordered was a grilled cheese sandwich and fries. The sandwich was horrible and the fries were burnt and greasy. Please don't waste time/money on this place."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVERRRR!!! 

It took me foreverrrr to get my food. they got my boyfriend's order wrong TWICE!!!! the food wasnt good at all, and the \"milkshakes\" weren't milkshakes at al!! 
i dont advise anyone to go to this diner worst experience everrr!!!"}
{"text":"I have traveled the Midwest to find a place such as this.... THE WORLDS WORST RESTAURANT. 

Some would say I am a sadomasochist for bad food, horrible service, and a restaurant that (quite frankly) smells like poo (this is not artistic license, when you walk in the first set of doors just breathe in and remember this review haunting you from the interwebs). Well after eating here I would have to agree.

If it is fried they can make it, only not well.

Stay far far away. It is like a diner from hell, wrapped in a hand basket, dipped in batter, fried, served cold because it takes 30mins to get anything out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I have to echo: this is the worst restaurant ever created. Every time I've been there, I wondered what I was thinking. (Several of those times, I was drunk, to be fair.) The food is ridiculously overpriced. I once had breaded mushrooms that were simultaneously overcooked on the outside and frozen in the middle."}
