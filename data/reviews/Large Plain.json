{"text":"Very good - it was our first time trying Large Plain. very good hand tossed pizza. it was fast and delicious."}
{"text":"This place is the best local pizza we've found!  Everything is always hot and fresh.  Also love their Tally Tuesday special!"}
{"text":"Drove far to try it for the first time after reading the reviews and looking at the photos. We were definitely disappointed. The Sicilian was underwhelming, both in size and execution. We opened the box and seriously questioned if it was even 16 cuts. It just looked sad. The round wasn't that much better. I thought it was a independent shop, but it tastes just like Pizza Milano Chain. We don't do chains since Pittsburgh has a ton of Mom and Pop Pizza places that are far superior."}
{"text":"ALl of their pizzas are amazing. Plus free delivery cant beat that these days!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not the worst I've had but far from the best.  The crust is thin and they are light on the cheese.  The part I don't like is the pizza hut track the pizza goes through to cook.  It is not like having a real pizza oven. The are better than Lupi's."}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. By chance I found it while in McKnight rd and wanted to try a new pizza place. Its awesome. It seems like it's fairly new but that doesn't make it taste any less amazing. I think I've met the owner or at least the main cook she was so nice!! My second time there she Gave me coupons and extra 6 wings. I mean how nice was that!! She was so nice and friendly. We talked while I was paying and she seemed very down to earth and just a nice person. They definitely have a great thing going on there. Its clean! Easy to get too. The prices are really good. I got a xl for less than 15$. I tried their wings and they were really good too. If you like hot wings their definitely worth getting. Their pizza is not overly greasy, just enough sauce and cheese. I've only had pepperoni pizza but thats definitely good enough. Its not like you HAVE TO have a bunch of toppings. I would like to try some other toppings though just to see what it's like. If your in the area definitely try it!! It says  limited delivery so im I'm not sure where they go to. I've always picked up."}
{"text":"tonight was the first  time we've ordered from this place. I was pleasantly surprized that they dont skimp on toppings like most pizza places. The pizza was delicious. we will definitely order from this place again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Greek Pizza. It was pretty good and I'm glad to have found a pizza place nearby that makes quality pies. Thin crust, not super crispy, and the toppings all tasted fresh.  According to the sticker on the box when it was delivered, they have a buy 1, get 1 promotion during Pens games. This would have been nice to know before we ordered."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and 16 inch hoagies.  Prices are comparable to competitors and delivery is very quick"}
{"text":"Tried Large Plain for the first time tonight. Ordered the large Buffalo Chicken sub for 9.99. Probably the most underwhelming and mediocre sub I've ever had. The bread was chewy, and there was almost no sauce. I was able to dump the ingredients off of the bread and the bread looked untouched.  Pretty disappointed for such an expensive sandwich."}
{"text":"I passed Large Plain numerous times before finally trying it. After all, it's a memorable name but having the word Plain in the title isn't encouraging to the passer by. While the Spinach and Chicken pizza has become my favorite and I tend to stick to it, my housemate has tried a variety of orders and is pleased each time. Large Plain is a good, reliable pizza place - a much better option than the national chains for price, delivery times, and flavor. My only critique is one I have of many delivery joints: there is a good chance they will forget your drink order so order cautiously. One lucky time he had just forgotten them in the car, but the delivery man has show up more than a couple of times without the beverages. Remember what you ordered when he shows up and check your food before he goes."}
{"text":"We came home from a long day and Large Plain was open, we were staying close by so we thought we would try it.  It doesn't look like much but the pizza is good!  We ordered 1/2 combo and cheese.  Everybody was pleased.  It was recommended by a friend as well. I recommend it too!"}
{"text":"decent pizza place, but they are kind of the worst with up charges if you order online? They have a $2.00 delivery fee online and double up charged me for asking for an extra Italian dressing packet.   food though! buffalo chicken hoagie is really good. mozzarella sticks are not. chicken ranchero was average, but i've never had one that's above average?"}
{"text":"Love little pizza places like this.  Was able to put a order there through yelp and got large cheese.  Pizza there is big and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"We heard so much about this pizza place. 20 minutes away. Very disappointed the sauce is bland and crust was soggy. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but I would say toppings are pretty skimpy. I had scarce black olives and tomatoes on my pizza. The crust is a bit thick too.  Overall it's good and we enjoyed it"}
{"text":"First time ordering there today and I'm absolutely positive we've found out new pizza shop. My boyfriend tried ordering online but it didn't work so we did have to call it in, the only downfall of it all. We got the Tuscon chicken pizza and it was delicious. The chicken is real chicken breast and as for the vegetables and toppings you can taste the freshness with the first bite. I literally fell in love with this pizza as soon as I saw it. Fresh peppers, artichokes, parsley and chicken that falls apart when you try to pull it off. Mmmm, mouth watering. The wings were fine perfectly. Crispy and not slimy. We got mild buffalo and the Louisiana sauce. So impressed with this place, I can't wait to eat there again!!!"}
{"text":"I've ways had a great experience ordering here.  You can do it online, pay online, and wait for deliciousness.  Typical appetizers.  The pizza is great, thinner crust, but chewy still.   Always my go to!"}
{"text":"A great find and they deliver to our new house!   The phone call in to order was painless and quick and the pizza arrived promptly. The price is great for the quality of the pizza.   The pizza was exactly what we were hoping for. A nice crust that was doughy without being undercooked. The part that makes or breaks a pizza for me is where the crust meets the cheese line. Large Plain puts cheese all the way up to crust without the gross sauce-only portion.   We will definitely make this a go to pizza shop!"}
{"text":"This tiny little gem is tucked off of Babcock Blvd in a very tight, nondescript building, but the pizza is goood.    The star of Large Plain pizza is definitely the cheese - hence the name.  They almost force you into buying their large, plain pizza, which is great for the price (and tasty), but if you're like me and like a few meaty toppings on your pie, be careful as the cost really skyrockets.  They want about $2 per topping (and bacon counts as a *double* topping) so I feel like I'm being gouged for being a T-Rex, in a way.    Still, it's phenomenal pizza.  Just expect to part with about $20 if you want more than one topping on it."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturday's ago by myself for pizza.  I knew that I was going to be in the area ahead of time and so I placed an order for a single large cheese pizza.  After taking my order I was told that it would be about 15-20 minutes before it was ready.  I arrived at the restaurant just over 25 minutes later and the pizza was ready.  The inside of Large Plain wasn't much to look at as there was a counter and a few picnic tables inside with a few more picnic tables outside.  The whole process of picking up the pizza took maybe 2 minutes which was impressive especially since the employee was friendly to me.    Large Plain's pizza is a medium thickness crust pizza although it is on the thinner side of that thickness.  That allowed for the crust to be somewhat crispy which is something that I love in pizza.  It had a good ratio of cheese to sauce which made eating it easy but I didn't think that there was anything special about either ingredient.  In the end it was a solid pizza that was A-OK.  The bottom line for me is that I might stop by here again in the future.  Yes the service was nice and the pizza was ok but there are plenty of better pizza places in the area that I would be more likely to head to first."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza but I honestly order less frequently because I have to give my address every time I call for delivery. GET A POS SYSTEM!"}
{"text":"First time getting pizza from Large Plain.  I live close by but the building and name does not inspire one to go there.  Just got done having a pepperoni pizza and super deluxe.  The sauce is good but the crust is very plain and doesn't have much flavor.  I'm a big fan of good crust but theirs tasted very bland like frozen bread dough from the super market.  Prices were reasonable but not cheap.  Have to say the name and building are very appropriate for the pizza they make.  Guess I have to keep searching for great pizza in the North Hills but haven't found it yet."}
{"text":"Pizza is awful... Sweet sauce and generic dough. It reminds me of a pizza pronto. Not good at all! I got a ranch steak hoagie. Again, like a pizza pronto hoagie. Gross steak, maybe 5 fries, and no toppings. I will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, great prices, and awesome service. The deliver guys are always really friendly, and the food arrives delicious & on time. Large Plain is *definitely* my new go-to."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery since I'm from Cali and have absolutely no idea how to drive in this snow... Yum. Very good. The best part is the thick cut ham. It's crisp and chewy. Very delightful. Dough: was not too pleased. I like my dough slightly crunchy. New York style. This was more chewy... Sad. Then I reheated in a frypan for 3 mins or so. Phenomenal. Not greasy. Just the right amount of crisp and crunch. Now I am hooked. Just wish it came that way...  Delivery was spot on."}
{"text":"Each pie is a work of art. And tastes great."}
{"text":"A little positive first, I love that I am able to order online. But... My email was time stamped 7:15pm and the extra large pizza with pepperoni and 13 hot wings I ordered showed up at 8:17pm.  I can almost hit a golf ball to the restaurant.  Wings are okay and I thought this pizza is identical to every other pizza in Pittsburgh.  My wife thought it had no flavor; she had three bites and gave up.  I understand that it's Friday night, they were probably busy; so I should expect the delivery delay.  I called to check and was put on hold and then hung up on.  Waiting for an hour and getting below average food leaves a bad taste. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"This past Tuesday (4/14) we had a small meeting at the Masonic Center and were planning on eating afterwards. I had found Large Plain on yelp after learning that Monte Cello's does not deliver. After reading the reviews here, I placed my order for 4 Sicilian pizzas and set delivery up between 9:15/9:30pm. The young lady that answered my call was very polite and helpful. I ordered a chicken ranchero, meat lovers, cheese and pepperoni. They were delivered right on time at 9:30. This is the first time my lodge has had pizza from here (same as myself since I'm not from the North Hills) and wow, it was fantastic. Large Plain has a new set of customers!!!  I'm excited to try other things from their menu."}
{"text":"Best pizza around!! Always so good and such great service. Their breadsticks are very good too! The prices are awesome here, and everything we have tried has been great. The pizza, if ordered with sausage, comes with the small crumbled sausage which is hard to find and so good! I have to stop myself from ordering here so much.. Definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"\"Hey Darren,\" a co-worker calls to me 30 minutes before starting my shift the other day.   \"Yo!\"  \"I got two pieces of pizza left. Yer ahe human garbage disposal. Eat 'em.\"  \"Ya sure?\"  \"Yeah go ahead. No one else wants 'em. They're still warm.\"  \"Thanks man!\"  I bite into it and find that it's a rather derivative Pittsburgh pie; chewy crust, oily cheese, sweet sauce. Journeyman would be the best descriptor.   \"Where'd ya get it?\" I needed to know where it came from so as to write a review.  \"Large Plain.\"  \"Huh?\"  \"Large Plain.\"  \"Yeah, I can see that it was a large plain pizza, but where did you get it from?\"  \"Large Plain. Babcock Boulevard.\"  \"That's the name of the place?\"  Unnamed co-worker whips out a menu.  \"I came prepared since I know you're into that there Kelp site.\"  \"No, it's Yelp.\"  \"You mean Delp? The guy that sang in the band Boston? He was good. What a shame he...\"  \"No, YELP!\"  \"Shelp? \"What the hell's that mean?\"  \"YELLLLPPPPP!\"  \"Ohhhh. Whelp! Why's it called that? That don't make no sense.\"  I'm trapped in Bizarro World! Help!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza if you haven't tried it it's a must! If you don't believe me.......they won best pizza in Pittsburgh from star 100.7."}
{"text":"These folks know how to make great pizzas. I recently ordered two basic, large pizzas. Took them home to be enjoyed by friends. All absolutely loved them. Pizza is a common item, but these were uncommonly good. The dough was very good. Amount of topping was just right - not too much, not to little. Perhaps the best item are the folks that work there. Very polite, nice, and helpful. All in all, a great pizza and very good overall experience."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in the North Hills. Discernible fresh ingredients and an exceptional crust that they brush with garlic butter before going into the oven.   The service can be touch and go at times, but their product speaks for itself and they deserve the 5 I gave them."}
