{"text":"We head out on a pretty regular basis with friends on the weekend for brunch. We try to hit local businesses with character and try something new each time. Well, this place has character as it is quite old and quite dirty as well! The owners have not kept this place up and perhaps that is part of the charm~ for some. 

It is a tiny diner and there is no where for a group of 5 to sit. There is no wait staff, so you need to stand in line for a good 10 minutes to place your order if there is one or two people in front of you. Then you get to wait 20-30 minutes for your food to come out to you and then the order isn't right. 

Now seriously people, I can make this exact meal at home for a fraction of the price. I will need to run to Safeway first however and grab some frozen burgers and some powdered gravy mix and there you have it, same meal! You may actually prefer my house, it is clean!"}
{"text":"Awesome milkshakes with options for fresh fruit! great hard ice cream flavours! Awesome variety of fresh food! Gotta try this!"}
{"text":"Peters drive in has nothing on this place!!!! The best milkshakes and burgers. Deep fried mushrooms are a must try, as well as the mushroom burger! Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"I was going to go to Bowness Park  for a walk and remembered heard about a Dive that was close by, i did not realize how close it was so off i went for a late lunch.
I ordered the Mozza Burger combo and a small side of Onion rings .
the burger was good better then McDonalds and and other such chains and the onion rings were the style i love from dives and dinners the nice battered ones...... 
The bun the condiments  were all fresh and the fries were ok... they could have been cooked a little longer ( if this is the norm i will ask them to keep them in the oil longer next time)  Next time im in the area and i am hungry i will be stopping back"}
{"text":"Fantastic little diner and I love the 50's vibe although it is badly in need of renovations. The food was amazing and the prices were lower than most. I would frequent this place more often!"}
{"text":"Cool little drive-in with great burgers and shakes. And excellent poutine! Well worth the visit if you're ever near by.

I like the drive-in/dive factor of this spot but it is far too expensive and very slow."}
{"text":"BEST MILKSHAKES ever , real fruit if u request them , 
BEST HAMBURGERS! Oh that sauce and the curly fries, the Poutine is a must at Angel's .This place kept its 50s feel which I love going to and supporting family businesses , nothing is commercialized at Angels. WORTH EVERY PENNY :D"}
{"text":"Tried this place after reading the rave reviews and wanting a diner with a decent hot hamburger nearby.  Anticipation was high and reality was a very cold shower.  Granted I arrived an hour before closing but the meal I received was not very good.  The burger patties must have been precooked as they were dry and crumbly.  The frozen vegetables were freezer burnt.  But the gravy was the most disappointing, as it was a dark salty Bovril based premix.  

Hoping to wash my disappointment down with a tasty milk shake once again it did not live up to expectations.  The shake was nicely thick but had hardly any flavouring, it was a good vanilla shake but I wanted pineapple.

It does have a cozy diner feel and the drive thru is still operational but the food is not fresh and up to par."}
{"text":"Angel's Drive Inn is a strange place.  I ordered the food to go, waited in the drive through for a burger and a shake, I waited 20 minutes.  I dont understand why this place is held in such high esteem, I cant say I was impressed by the efficiency of operations or the quality of the food.  

Try Peters Drive In instead"}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Service is okay but they only have 2 people working and it's small so they do what they can. Great food great price but the place is in shambles and it looks dirty inside.. Time for a Reno for sure!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing and boring food. Generic French fries that were undercooked and over salted. Milkshakes were as sweet as suger, which means they were total garbage. Burgers were frozen and bland.

Best thing about this place is I don't have to go back."}
{"text":"Even if you've never been to Angel's Drive-In, you've FOR SURE seen it. You know, the blue shack that stands out like a sore thumb in Bowness Calgary.

I recently made a trip over with my boyfriend and I LOVED it. It's small, it's quaint, and it's a little ghetto, but it all adds to the atmosphere!

The service is fantastic and the food is delicious. I especially LOVE their french fries. I don't know what they do to them, or how they season them, but they are DELISH. Plus I love that this is the only Drive In in Calgary that actually offers a veggie burger! Go Angel's!!!

This place has been around FOREVER and I can see why. The food is great, the service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is memorable to say the least!

Sapna G. is definitely team Angel's Drive In, and I'm positive you will be too once you make the trip."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!! Pleasantly surprised!

Seen it a million times driving by but after Bowness park we were all a bit famished and stopped in.

First - it's really retro in here and I like old school so this is something I enjoy. Sat in a  booth, that needed a bit of work but still, it fit with the atmosphere.

Had a great server. Very friendly and sweet.

Ordered up a milk shake and some lunch. Good old cheese burger with onion rings. Everyone else had cheese burgers with fries. Milk Shake was yummy and my husband ordered a float, which I tasted and was really good too. Mental note for next time.

When it all arrived I thought, I cant eat all of this. It was sooooo good, that in fact I did eat all of it. So many things on the menu I want to try for next time so I'm going to have to come back a few more times.

Great little retro gem!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very, very good!
Bowness burger and shake was the best!
Maybe the best little drive-in in Calgary now.

JC"}
{"text":"I come here way too frequently. Everything is to die for, especially the milkshakes. The staff are so kind and accommodating. Great for dates or kids."}
{"text":"Pretty good little place if you're in Bowness!  Had the mushroom burger (I wouldn't get it again based on it being very boring; mushrooms and mushroom soup sauce) however the hubby got the double cheese and it was delicious! Fries are great too!"}
{"text":"I could make this at home with basic ingredients and I'm not even a good cook. Disappointing and overpriced. I don't get what all the hype is about..."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Angel's. Just note that this is not a fast-food joint but a diner. Everything is cooked to order and prepared carefully. I tried the mushroom burger with onion rings and battered mushrooms and a banana chocolate milkshake. If you like milkshakes, try one here. The ice-cream stays cold for a long time and the fruit added to it is delicious. I enjoyed my burger and the crunchy munchy onion rings. The deep-fried mushrooms are a must. I like the side of ranch to dip my sides over the usual ketchup.

Angel's was really busy on my visit. The stream of customers never seemed to stop. I noticed Angel's has a family pack of burgers which would make it a great option for a picnic in Bowness Park! Looking forward to my next visit. The staff are friendly."}
{"text":"This place is automatic. It's systematic. It's hyyyyyydromatic. Well, it's... not nearly as cheesy as that 1978 musical, but has all of the same classic vibes from the timeless baby-boom era of of all-american fast cars and cold root-beer... but in an authentic way.  When I go to angels, I not only want a good old fashioned cheese burger and a root beer float, I want a sea foam bel-air with a drop top to order it from. 

Angels is a popular meeting spot and parking lot show'n'shine location for Calgary's Classic Car Culture, boasting classic cars and hot rods every wednesday night. And rightfully so. Angel's been around since the 50's! Remember that when you're sitting on there in the cracking vinyl booths and the faded, greyish black and white checker floor - yah, it's starting to look a little old as well as retro... but that's it's because it is!

Their real fruit shakes are so good. SO good. I think it's well worth the limited number of flavours to go with the real fruit ones. After a real fruit shake from Angel's Drive In, I I bet you'll have trouble even remembering who \"Peter\" is. 

If you don't have cool wheels to stop at Angels while you're out for a classic Sunday drive, you can use you feet to walk over for a nice stroll just around the corner at Bowness Park. 

While I wish they were able to give Angel's a bit of an interior update, (an original 50's update of course), and fix the table side juke boxes so I can happily plug it with loonies all lunch and listen my favourite...2PAC Classics?? Seriously, Angel's... what the heck is up with your playlist? Why does the Jay-Z selection outweigh the Elvis? ...I'm just happy to have a place like Angel's around, helping to keep Bowness feeling like a good ol' small town community amidst the ever expanding surrounding metropolis."}
{"text":"Pretty good for an old fashioned hamburger!!
Great Shake! (Calgary, Alberta) 
We enjoyed this 20 min on the run lunch.
Nice people!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have only tried this place once. Their new renovation is nice. Feels like a 50's Dinner. We were happy to see that they have gluten free buns. I think that they get them from Care Bakery which makes the best gluten free buns and bread. I can easily say that Angels has the best gluten free burger in a bun (we usually have burgers in a lettuce wrap because gluten free buns are not very good) that I have ever had. I see a lot of positive comments on their fries but we found them to be under cooked. We like our fries a little more well done and crispier. Maybe we caught them on a bad day. The only really negative comment we have to make is that that the alarm on their deep fryer is way to loud, to the point where it is very annoying."}
{"text":"Angel review
 DISSAPOINTMENT

Service is everything. 
Angels is lacking everything.  
Not only do you get cold limp fry Poutine(NOT MADE WITH CURDS. Blasphemy)
Don't count on your orders coming together.
Waited 30 minutes.  Not even busy.
Still waiting for my partner to get his meal.  Nearly 10 minutes later it came out of the kitchen.
Food is bad.   Stomach doesn't even want to keep it down.  
Ranch dressing and Thousand Island on my chicken burger.  So many questions about the condiment choice. 
Don,
Don't order a gyro if you want to eat today.  It had no resemblance to a gyro...more like a sloppy ranch chicken disaster.

Don't eat here.  That's my advice.  
I'll never go back. 
Can't polish a turd."}
{"text":"Many times a person just feels like a good burger and onion rings!

Yes, my daughter used to work there years ago (sometimes babysitting the actual 'Angel') and because of that our family knows the owner who's a very nice guy. 

Barring all that, I'd STILL love going to Angel's because the food is so much better than a fast food joint. I'm not quite sure what people are fussing about when they say they waited longer for their food than they expected.  If you cook a good burger in your own home, do you expect it to be ready in 5 minutes?

That's WHY those 'other' places are called 'Fast Food' joints.

I find a French fry to be a French fry (I love almost all of them anyway), but the onion rings here are the BEST, and if you happen to like deep fried mushrooms like I do, this is your place!

For a small drive-in, there are surprisingly many choices, and I have to say I've never been disappointed!

The first Saturday of Stampede they have a live band on the roof which is so entertaining and a great time to buy an ice cream and stand or sit outside and enjoy the music!

Do yourself a favour and stop in for a great meal before the Summer is over. (Even though they're open all year long!)"}
{"text":"The presentation of the restaurant is very nice the new renovation is very appealing but the food doesn't match the freshness of the decor or the price tag. We ordered the barbeque burger, The bowness burger, curly fries and 2 shakes and it cost a whopping $30. The meat patties in the burgers were cold and tasteless and the buns were too big for the burger. Curly fries and the shakes were good but not good enough for us to ever go back. What a shame. So disappointing as we could not wait to go there once the Reno's were done."}
{"text":"This place should be on the 'You've Got to Eat Here\" show.  It's a little hidden gem!  Milkshakes and burgers are very impressive.  High five to their renovations."}
{"text":"A bit of an institution worthy of a visit and a place I've gone for years.  The only problem is I often don't remember how badly I feel after eating here.  I'm not sure what it is but 75% of the time I end up with my body scolding me for stopping here.  Maybe it's the fact I combine fries, burgers and milk shakes when I can only get away with a few bad foods at a time?  I dunno... and I don't know anyone else that makes similar complaints.  

That being said... I do keep going back... and that's because it's yummy. 

I like mixing milk shake flavors and the spicy fries here the best.  There is not one iota of health in this food ...  so keep that in mind but it's fun occationally."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers....blew Pete's right out of the water!"}
{"text":"I used to love going to Angels for a milkshake and a burger but this weekend was not up to par.  Macdonalds milkshake and burgers are better and way cheaper than what I had.  We threw the fries in the garbage they were half cooked after we waited for 20 min in the drive through for our food.  $18 for 2 single cheeseburgers, a milkshake and small pop is steep. :("}
{"text":"Great, friendly service.  Just stopped in for an ice cream.  Great prices, and good portion for the price.  Very cool decor, has feeling of the movie Grease, but also looks like it could use a deep clean.  Feels like a mom and pop shop, I will be back."}
{"text":"Every time I'm near Bowness Park, this is the place to visit. It's my burger fix, not only are the burgers great, the fries are awesome and topped with a bubblegum milkshake. There are lots of menu options, I also enjoyed the beef dip here, and fish and chips. Great place to eat in or like me I enjoy taking the food to the park with the family."}
{"text":"Slowest service I've ever received at a fast food place. There was not many people at the restaurant, and only one car ahead of us at the drive thru. It took 17 minutes for the car ahead of us and us to order our meals. Then, we waited over 35 more minutes for our food to be brought out to us. EXTREMELY slow. There is no reason it should have taken that long. Once we did get our food, it was mediocre at best. Barely any toppings on the burgers, the fries were cold, and the milkshakes were just ok. The person who was behind us in line is probably still there waiting to receive their food."}
{"text":"Even after the major renovation this place continues to underwhelm. The kids and I tried to give it a second chance last Friday (at 1pm) but we arrive to a restaurant which was full inside and no provisions for seating outside (tables but no chairs) on a +15C day. Couldn't help but notice that at the half-dozen full tables inside only two actually had food on them. This didn't look promising but we pressed on. Went to the counter and started to look at the menu while I waited to be served. Couldn't figure out the menus as they seemed to be three different ones and they all had different things on them. One was just wraps. The guy at the till didn't acknowledge me and started serving someone else and that's when this boondoggle ended. I gathered the kids and we headed up Nosehill to Boardwalk Burger in Crowfoot Crossing and were served promptly and had no problem finding a booth. There's no reason to put up with bad service in the NW. I suspect this place is propped up by the neighbourhood but it's not a destination you want to travel out of your way for. There's a lot of better lunch places in the NW that have a stronger menu - C.B. Drive Inn, for example, is a NW neighbourhood place (not a franchise) that does a much better job with their service in menu. 

I can't recommend Angel's it's pretty bush league still."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Since moving away from Calgary, I've recommended Angel's to anyone visiting the city. The Mozza burger is to die for, the poutine, although not technically poutine, is also delicious. Wish I could go back whenever I wanted...."}
{"text":"Hidden? Yes. Gem? Nope. With frozen beef patties and fries equivalent to Wendy's, I really don't understand why this place has a high rating. Anyone can make this food at home with little effort. Peter's is better. 

The only positive about this place is the interior decor 'cause it looks like you're eating at a blast from the past even though some areas need some repairs. Unfortunately, the menu is also a blast from the past.

I thought Calgarians had a much higher standard on burgers, given the options we have in this city."}
{"text":"This is a Calgary staple, a great hidden gem that has been around for a long time and has great character and ownership.  i'm happy to support small local businesses and feel they have given so much back to the community.  
Their menu is a good size and food tastes great.  They are not just an ice Cream stop, they have awesome burgers and great sandwiches.  Not always fast, but always friendly and i leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Best deep fried mushrooms!!! They always have the best food and service. I strongly recommend this place for some greasy indulgent food."}
{"text":"Angels has renovated, and it's super kitchy cool now!
The menu is the same, but if you sit inside the restaurant you'll feel the changes - it's like eating in a 50's diner, complete with old timey tabletop jukeboxes. 
Sadly, I forgot to take pictures (sorry!)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a sunny Sunday evening out with the family, The girlfriend and I had the mozza burger combo and the boy had the crispy chicken burger.  The chicken must have been good as he downed it without talking (a rare thing indeed). I would tell you to take you food a short drive and eat it in Bowness park or baker park just down the street to enjoy some great views of the river."}
{"text":"After a beautiful day skating in Bowness the crew and I were hungry.  We were trying to think of what was close by and we must have been pondering loud as another skater overheard us and mentioned Angel's Drive In.  We took the advice of this random person and headed over for a bite.  Angel's Drive in is located on the corner of 47th Avenue NW.  They have their own parking lot and theres parking in the back as well.  When I first pulled up, I was wondering if we were able to sit and eat as the place seems quite small.  Sure enough, we walked into what reminded me of a retro old school diner joint.  There was about 6 booths which was surprising to me as coming from the outside, this place looks deceiving!  

We were welcomed at the front by a smiling man.  The menu is quite extensive ranging from breakfast (served until 11:30am) to dinner entrees, donairs, soups, sandwiches, fried chicken, burger combos and a bunch of great sides. Ice cream, floats, milkshakes are also available for those with a sweet tooth!

We were all in a burger mood so we each got a different burger that suit our preferences.  I went with the mozza burger and battered mushrooms.  After we all ordered we went to have a seat and they brought the food to us.  It wasn't busy on a Saturday midafternoon so we didn't wait long.  My mozza burger was delicious!  The burger wasn't super thick but it was sure tasty!  There was this mayo based special sauce which was delicious, onions, mozzarella cheese, bacon, lettuce and tomato.  The battered mushrooms were yummy!  Be careful, as they are quite hot at first bite from the mushroom juices but definitely a must try with cool ranch dip!  The rest seem to be enjoying their burgers and fries.  My one girlfriend noticed that they arrange the pickles just the way she likes them (not overlapping but in a circle) so she told the guy she was quite impressed and he mentioned that they serve food at Angel's just the way they like to have it themselves which I thought was a great statement!  Our waters were always topped off and they were always checking on us to see how everything was.  We were all pleasantly surprised by the food quality and service attentiveness.

Angel's is definitely a place to hit up after spending a day in Bowness Park or even if you're craving a burger or something different - It's worth the drive where ever you are.  Next time I will get a milkshake and try something new!  

Peter's definitely has some competition because Angel's is really a great diner with delicious burgers, milkshakes and much much more!!"}
{"text":"The place was really busy so I took that as a good sign, but the food turned out to be pretty sub par. Not sure how it has 4 stars! 

First off, I found it pretty pricey considering it's more like a chip truck than a restaurant. There's a drive through and about 6 small tables inside. You order yourself, and they bring you the food. I also have to note it's pretty grimy in there. Old splashes of crap on the walls and layers of dirty fingerprints all over everything. It needs a DEEP clean. 

I'm not a vegetarian, but I like veggie burgers sometimes. The bun was WAY too big for the tiny veggie patty. It tasted like a bread & mayo sandwich. If there was like 2 massive beef patties on there, it probably would've been great, but otherwise not so much. 

The poutine had shredded cheese instead of cheese curds. To me that is not a poutine, it's fries with cheese and gravy. From the road this looks exactly like the type of place that would have a killer poutine so I was pretty disappointed. 

We ordered 3 pieces of deep fried mac & cheese, and 3 pieces of deep fried ravioli. 

The mac & cheese bites were yummy, but definitely cooked from frozen/ not homemade. 

I'm not sure if we actually got the fried ravioli or they made a mistake but it tasted like plain mashed potatoes inside. Weird right? The picture looked so delicious but what we got was nasty. 

Finally, the owner walked by and asked how the poutine was. I said jokingly that it needed cheese curds. His response was \"we've been doing it like that for 17 years...\" Why bother asking for my opinion if you don't want to hear it?! Lol. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business? Tried their hamburger about a year ago -- greasy, flavourless, just awful. Fries were limp and sad. Yesterday drive-through for a friend so I tried the ice cream cone, I mean, how could that be bad, right? It was like non-dairy creamer in a cone, not sweet, not vanilla, actually threw it away because it was just oily. Seriously, I'm amazed they have any customers at all."}
{"text":"It's slower than a chain but that's because it's real food cooked to order. Fries were plentiful and burger was great.   Maybe you can get a slightly better burger at a gourmet restraint for 20 bucks, but as far as an 8 to 10 dollar combo goes its definitely a good value for a tasty meal. I'm giving it the 5 stars because I think it's great for what it is... ...   is there a better burger out there.. probably, but this meal is generous and delicious."}
{"text":"Experience traditional Bowness on Friday  night, but expect to wait about 15 or 20 minutes. I did the drive through and went to eat in Bowness Park which is just around the corner from Angel's Drive In. 

As I waited in line, I chuckled ,as it drummed up memories of my childhood. Those were the days when the entire family would go to A&W and the carhop would bring a full tray of food that a family of two adults and four children that all could eat for $4.95. 

The price is quite reasonable here and the food was piping hot. Not greasy, the BBQ burger was very yummy and I could not finish the last bite. The fries were good, but I had hoped for home cut fries, and these looked like McCain's. I did like the burger better than the ones from Peter's Drive In."}
{"text":"Had my annual physical last week and the doctor said everything (blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) was all fine so I thought I'd reward myself with a thoroughly unhealthy meal.  Spent the afternoon in Bowness Park so Angel's seemed like a good idea!

I've been here a few times and its always been OK.  Nothing fancy, good burgers, good shakes and very reasonable prices.  This weekend's visit didn't stray far from the path.

The girlfriend and I decided to share a deluxe burger, a chicken snack pack and rings.  

Now thankfully this isn't mcdonalds so I'm not expected to be rocketed through at \"1 gazillion served\" speeds but quick service isn't Angel's strong suit.  Granted we did order the chicken and it would appear as though its cooked to order but it still took the better part of 15 min to get our food.  It was a nice evening so not a problem, just be aware of this if you're in a hurry.

The burger was very tasty and HUGE.  Topped out as requested and served on a fresh bun.  The chicken was very good and could easily have passed for home made.  Well seasoned, perfectly crispy...yum!  But best of all are the rings.  Oh so very very good!  No salt or ketchup required just deep fried greasy oniony goodness!  

I'll take Angel's over Peter's (which frankly I've never understood the appeal) any day of the week!"}
{"text":"Angel's Drive In is a gem in deep Bowness, walking distance from Bowness Park.  The burgers here are pretty good.  I ordered the double Mozza burger without onions and it came out right, even with that alteration.

The onion rings were excellent, but back to the burger. It tasted homemade which was exactly what I was looking for.  It was slathered with melted mozzarella and a blend of mayo and other sauces.  It wasn't the healthiest but hey, it's an old fashioned burger joint so you can't expect it to be healthy.  It was tasty though.

The place is in major need of repair and some consistency in brand.  Nothing a good paint job, some landscaping and a bit of renovations couldn't spruce up.  The food is excellent though which is the main thing.

Angel's Drive In is worth the drive over to Bowness.  On Wednesdays they advertise a show & shine; however, the Wednesday we were there they only had two classic cars and they left within ten minutes of us arriving.

We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here for breakfast last week and I was very pleasantly surprised (I didn't even realize they served breakfast!) They have a small breakfast menu (very reasonably priced), and while it is not fancy, it was a great diner meal. Worth the $. Self service helps keep the prices down (you order at the till and coffee is self serve). Some of the patrons in there were a bit rowdy/questionable, but that is not the restaurant's fault. Very friendly staff. Will be back for milkshakes."}
{"text":"Hey, old folks!  Are you feeling nostalgic?  Young people, you want to experience what diners were like in the 50's?  Well, I'm sure Angels hasn't changed much since it opened all those years ago.

Okay, I'm not really sure when it opened, but if I didn't know better I'd say that this was an authentic 50's diner!  Everything for the decorations to the colours are old school and seem classic.  They've got pictures of James Dean on the wall, old juke boxes at some tables, black checkered tiles, and the classic shiny blue leather booths.  I honestly feel like I've journeyed back in time when I go to Angels.

I'll be honest, I've never actually used the drive-thru, but that's because I think inside is so nifty.  I enjoy sitting down and experiencing it all.  The staff is always super nice, and they aren't that busy so they're pretty attentive too.  I wish they were a little more 50's though.  I'm talking jerry curls and poodle skirts.  Oh well.

I love the food at Angels too.  I don't know if that's what burgers and fries were like back in the day, but I do know that it's goooood!  They make a wicked Denver sandwich and an even better beef dip.  It's always a struggle to decide between the two for me.

I love Angel's because it really is like a little trip to the 50's.  It makes for interesting conversation, good food, and generally just a great time!"}
{"text":"oooh my gosh!! This is the best darn place I have ever gone for an old-fashioned burger. I really mean that. Actually, Rob had the burger and I had a grilled cheese & fries and a root beer float (sooo yummy!). Aside from the big, greasy and delicious food, the waitress we had was absolutely wonderful. You don't see service like that everyday these days, so that's for sure worth it.
And, to top off the great service and great food, it's surprisingly bigger on the inside than one would expect from the seedy shack-like appearance. It's very nicely decorated with photos of old cars and records on the wall with an ocassional James Dean poster. It's all authentic, and I understand the owner who has recently bought this diner/drive-thru has named it after his daughter. 
If you're in the mood for a classic burger, then this is one I reccomend ;)"}
{"text":"-Average, but correctly executed old school burgers, rings and fries.
-A bit steep on the prices, and certainly below standard with the 15 - 20 minute wait times even when not busy.
-Kitchy interior design with authentic table side juke box units, albeit from the 70s or 80s no the 50s.

Angels is without a doubt a place you go to mostly for the atmosphere, memories, or \"uniqueness\" --- and Angels DOES provide all 3 of these things generally speaking.

During the summer, there is a \"hot rod\" and / or \"motorcycle\" night (wednesdays I think) where a few or zero hot rods and bikes show up to hang out and display their cars.

In any event, Angels is way better than Peters Drive In for this category."}
