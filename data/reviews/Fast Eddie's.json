{"text":"I had the Saturday dinner special and it was great.  I want to come back to try the Sunday chicken Paprikas.  The bar has a good drink selection as well."}
{"text":"Wanted to have a nice meal on my break with my mom while I was in Parma. She suggested we tried fast eddies , a favorite of hers when she was younger. 

We went there and were given a window seat. We asked to move because it was a colder day and were given attitude about wanting a new seat. We waited a good 5-7 minutes for a sever to come and an additional 5-7 minutes for our drinks. The server had no personality and was rather rude to us throughout the whole experience. 

We ordered the loaded potato skins. They were good and hot, and honestly the best part of our experience. 

I ordered an iced tea which the server refilled multiple times without me asking. My mom on the other hand suffered , and only after asking received another lemonade. 

We got our burgers... And they were cold
My fries were mediocre, and my moms green beans also cold. 

The server brought us our check, and the price was a bit obscene for what we had ordered. 
Someone didn't get a big tip because of attitude, that's for sure.

We left our money with the check on the table and boogied on out , with sadness in our heart that it was no longer the restaurant my mom remembered and the one I was excited to experience with her.

I would not recommend fast eddies."}
{"text":"We had an opportunity to visit Fast Eddie's or shall I say \"Slow Edwards\"... The wait staff seemed a little inexperienced, as our waitress forgot to place our order and we were forced to wait over an hour to receive our food, considering it was only us and another couple in the entire restaurant. Fortunately, the food was second to none, cooked perfectly, and had us wanting more. 

Mistakes happen we understand that. The manager offered to pay for our dessert, which we greatly appreciated. Overall the experience was only okay, due to the lengthy time of waiting, us having to ask other servers for refills, and the extreme absence of our server. 

The food was absolutely amazing, definitely worth another visit. I guess next time we'll just sit the bar...."}
{"text":"Really over priced for the quality of food.
 
I got the beef brisket burger, they ask \"how would you liked it cooked?\" I say medium-well. Well this burger was passed well done- it was so dry it defeated the purpose of it being brisket. It tasted the same as low grade ground beef. I asked for no bun I got a bun. 
I got a side salad with ranch- waitress offered to bring that out first I hesitated but said sure.  I got my salad after I got my burger and it was soggy- super soggy. I look at the salad and I don't see any ranch, I confirm with the waitress that it's ranch and she didn't seem confident with her response. So who knows what I really ate, it tasted like wet salad so there was probably a tsp of ranch in a liter of water they bathed/drowned it in.

It was a $15 burger & salad that tasted like $4. Bummer."}
{"text":"We a had a really good lunch.  Service was great.  Food excellent.  Would go again.  Good addition for The Shoppes of Parma."}
{"text":"Very good food and a nice atmosphere! The prices are decent and service is always good. They also have a nice selection of craft beers on tap which they seem to change every month or so. We have been up several times and never had a bad experience with the food or service. Try the London burger and the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed. My burger could have used some seasoning, and my onion rings were also very bland. The food looked better than it tasted and was not worth the menu price. Most likely, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great flavorful food, so-so service. Have been there twice and both times never asked for refills for any beverages. This could be a BOOMING PLACE with the right help."}
{"text":"We had a really great experience this past Friday during our first visit to Eddie Cerino's newest operation. The food and service were top notch, and it was a fun environment. You'd never guess in a million years that this space used to house both a Houlihan's and TGI Friday's. I'll be eager to visit again in the summer when the garage doors are open, and the mall is completely rehabbed. 

Definitely try the Eddie's Favorite burger...it's been my \"go-to\" since I worked at Eddie's Creekside in the 90's...would love to see them bring back the Chicken Sorrento in the original recipe form..."}
{"text":"Over-priced mall food.  Over-inflated egos. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I had the wedge salad and the Blt. I found the flavor to be very bland on the Wedge. It was on romaine and usually it's on iceberg. I don't prefer one over an other but I didn't even finish it due to the lack of flavor. The Blt tastes great but was super salty. I was disappointed for how much I paid. $17 for just those 2 things.... I most likely will not return."}
{"text":"Server was very knowledgable about the menu. they have great burgers, food and shakes. I love the atmosphere and special desserts are awesome too! The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Good was good services was fast and good. Thanks was looking the biers burger and pizza burger. I remember from the old fast eddies but thanks again!"}
{"text":"Went with the family around 7pm during the week. I had the beet and goat cheese salad which was very good. My husband had a burger and he said it was good too/ better than the Outback Steakhouse burger he had the previous week. Kids had Mac and Cheese which they ate like we haven't fed them in a week. My only not so great was our server. She forgot one kids chocolate milk and had to be reminded to bring it. My water was t refilled for most of my dinner, I had asked for my soup to come out before my salad and that didn't happen. Then when the kids Mac and Cheese came I had asked for spoons and she forgot. She actually didn't return for a long time and the kids were beginning to get beyond hungry. After more than 5 minutes I had to flag her down and remind her that they couldn't eat yet. She said \"Oh yeah\" and they got their spoons. So maybe she was new but the lack of urgency and basic server responsibilities were lacking. She was nice and kind."}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic dinner at Fast Eddies. The Cerino family always does a good job. I was curious to see if it would be similar to the Fast Eddie's I knew growing up in Brecksville but this menu is different. It's more modern was good variety. My only complaint is that I wish there were more vegetarian options. 

I tried the portobello sandwich with sweet potato fries. It was great although I do think they could put it on something fancier than white bread.   husband had a burger (the cowboy) and loved it. He wants to go back and try some other burgers. I'd go back to try some salads.

Overall it was a great meal.  Good service as always. We will be back."}
{"text":"I cannot believe there aren't photos on here of the gorgeous chairs and barstools.  I told my husband that he was very lucky we had just purchased new barstools for a kitchen a couple months ago or I'd be tracking these down, cost be damned!  I also really liked the flamingo art in the restroom.

I was very happy they seated us in the private dining room because my toddler started having a breakdown on his way from the car into the restaurant, and just walking through the bar area was humiliating enough.  Thankfully we didn't have to sit there and worry the whole time that we were ruining everyone else's meals.  

My husband and I both thought our burgers were better than average.  I was happy to see plenty of things on the menu I was interested in trying.  The best thing about Fast Eddie's is the location.  This is a great addition to an otherwise boring area (food-wise, at least).  We will hopefully be back!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to the original place and I am glad to see them back. Parma needs more local businesses, not chain restaurant after chain restaurant...hey look another Starbucks!  The atmosphere and layout is modern and service was very good.  Good food, but prices are steep for this type of fare-mainly burgers and fries.  I thought the food, especially the onion rings were on the greasy side.  I would go back again and wish them well in their new spot."}
{"text":"Brought a few co-workers here for a weekday lunch.  The place was pretty empty and we were seated right away.  Our served was quite friendly and attentive.  I came for their burgers, each of my co-workers ordered other menu items.

The fried chicken sandwich order by one colleague was literally overflowing from its bun, and she said she really enjoyed it.  The other person ordered and entrée-sized salad which she completely ate.

My burger was just okay.  I decided to try their unique peanut butter burger.  The bun to meat ration was off (it had a really thick bun) and the thin beef patty was cooked more to medium than medium-rare, which is difficult given the sizing of the patty.  Their fries were crispy and tasty and served in a mountainous style, but their ranch dressing (used for dipping) had a funny taste to it that I just could not put my finger on.

I might give this spot another try, given the positive reviews from my co-workers...maybe I'll try some other dish."}
{"text":"Fast Eddies is back and the burgers are as great as I remember. I had the Eddies favorite and I think it's mine too.  My wife had the London and it was great as well. This has been added to our favorites list and if you try it out it may make yours too!"}
{"text":"Great food, interesting menu, good drinks, nice open atmosphere, decent service, just a bit pricey. I was there on a Thursday night and we did have to wait about a half hour for a table, but that was a good thing, they were packed! We were happy to see them doing well. Service wasn't immediate at first, maybe a few minutes before our server stopped by, but once she was there, she was on it the rest of the night. Again, a testament to how busy it was, we could see all the staff were working really hard. 

Whatever was going on around us, though, we had no clue once the food arrived. It was so delicious. I had the Kung pao stir fry and my friend had the country fried chicken (Thursday only item) and both were excellent. My stir fry was cooked perfectly with all fresh veggies and ground chicken in a yummy sauce, nothing overpowering or over-seasoned. The country fried chicken in a light gravy with mashed potatoes and garlic green beans was so, so delicious. I only tried two bites and as much as I liked my dish, I can't wait to go back and get my own. It's not the healthiest with that batter covered chicken, but again, all the flavors just came together and was cooked perfectly--worth the calorie splurge. 

The only thing we were not expecting was the higher price range, but honestly, with the quality of ingredients and variety, their dishes are probably priced pretty fairly. It just means we can't go as often as we'd like."}
{"text":"This place is decent but I would not rush back. My wife and I grabbed lunch here a little before Christmas and thinking it was comparable to Five Guys, I was pleasantly surprised, the place was a couple steps up from my expectations. I had the Crispy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and Sweet Potato Fries. My wife had the Classic Cheeseburger. Both were cooked right and the taste was good. Not sure if the blue cheese mayo hit me wrong but my stomach was turning for the rest of the day. I have no issues with spicy, so not sure what did it.  The place was moderately busy but not crowded. The service was good and we were checked on often. The atmosphere is a little lacking. Some pictures of old cars, here and there but otherwise cold and uninviting; cannot quite tell what they were going for with the design. The bar looks good but only one person was here this day around lunch time. The pricing is a bit high for the food and restaurant type but it was not ridiculous. Would probably come back but not frequently."}
{"text":"we went to Fast Eddie's a couple weeks ago after i'd put it off for a while. i'm glad we did. the menu did nothing for me when looking at it online. 

i ordered the peanut butter burger and fries. the soup of the day was split pea so i tried that as well. the soup was delicious. i'll definitely be looking forward to having it again. the burger was really tasty as well but i'd like more peanut butter next time."}
{"text":"Just had an amazing burger at Fast Eddies in Parma. It was cooked perfect, and it was delicious. The fries I had with it came out hot and seasoned just right. Keep it up Eddie!! Good job."}
{"text":"Must say I didn't like anything, starting with the funky tasting water.  Then the odd smell of the meat that didn't smell like chorizo or ground chicken.  I had the \"Hottie\" it wasn't hot at all and the amount of sour cream sauce was yuck. 
Paid the extra 2 Bucks to upgrade to onion rings..  Really o ring upcharge .. They were light crispy and flavorless.

Finished with a wedge salad.  They tried to hard to make it there own.  Romaine instead of iceberg.  I think they used a cheese grater to chop the eggs and bacon.  They were like dust. They use a house made thousand island that tastes like they live at the Kraft house.  Stick with blue cheese crumbles..

The Service was fine, but I won't be back.."}
{"text":"Our service was good and so was our waitress. The chili was really good I have to say.  The burger was perfectly cooked and the fries were solid. The best part was the price it was not much more than a fast casual place but the food was way better. The decor is simple and not cluttered def will be back."}
{"text":"Tried the London Burger which was really good.  The aged cheddar on it was awsome.   I am for sure going back.   I sat at the bar and there was only one bar tender and it was too busy just for the one they he needed help bad."}
{"text":"Service is impeccable, food awesome, and the atmosphere delightful a must for the family and kids."}
{"text":"When I think of Fast Eddie's I think of the original location I used to go to as a kid. Down home diner on Pearl road in Parma. All I can tell you is that it's 2017 and most certainly things have changed...except for the onion rings. 

Fast Eddie's is now a modern restaurant in the former Houlihans Parmatown spot. While the visit didn't start off great, it turned around fast once we were seated and were able to order. I went with the Big Ed to take me back to my childhood and of course subbed in onion rings. The minute I sank my teeth into one of those rings I was transported back in time. I felt like a kid sitting in the original Fast Eddie's with my grandparents after a football game at Byers field. As for the burger...it was great...but way too big for my appetite these days. It was just like I remembered from my childhood. Our server was excellent but I will say...it was a bit pricey for burgers and onion rings. That being said...I will totally go back to get that taste of nostalgia I've been missing out on for the past 25 years."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The sweet potato fries, cowboy burger and the meatloaf are my favorites!"}
{"text":"A peanut butter bacon burger!  Yeah, and it was awesome.  Three of us sat at the bar for happy hour which gave us great pricing on craft beer and some of their starters along with friendly service.  We shared the Kung Pao lettuce wraps and after a few more craft beers we needed something more so we turned to their burgers. I subbed for the onion rings which were delicious but the fries were pretty tasty too.  This place was way better than I expected for a strip mall restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW! We were so impressed with this place - we had 3 young kids with us, and it wasn't a problem, the atmosphere was noisy enough that we didn't feel conspicuous with our kiddos making noise, but it was adult-friendly too, with a great looking bar/beer list. The food was OUTSTANDING! Burger might be the best I've had in years - the bun was to die for. We all shared a milkshake at the end of the meal and it was delicious...and the kids of course loved it :-)  Kids menu is small but totally fine, and the regular menu is great. We had a BLT (which was MASSIVE), the Chicken melt sandwich with mushrooms, which was served on garlic bread and perfectly cooked - nice, thin chicken, not hard to bite into or eat - sandwich didn't fall apart once you bit into it, and the regular cheeseburger was the star of the meal - just fabulous. French fries were like old fashioned carnival fries (wish they would have offered vinegar, actually) - and the onion rings were probably our least favorite of the whole meal, they were a little bit greasy for our taste. Overall, this was a great experience, we are sure to be back with our family again!"}
{"text":"Eddie's is a neighborhood spot for me so I frequent it often. The food has been great. Great specials. Homecooked flair with good portion size. My next plan is to try the Sunday brunch. The drinks have been adequate from the bar. My only complaint is that it is not comfortable. The seating is hard tables and chairs and it is loud. I'm over the whole \"industrialized\" trend in restaurants. I want comfortable seating that makes me want to linger and savor my meal.  I order more that way!  :)

3/12/17 Edit:

So I've been back several times....and I really do like the place. So I'm changing to 4 stars.  The staff is friendly, (Even tho others I know have had bad experiences I never have) the place is spotless, the food comes out quickly and is always fresh.

My new addiction is their Kung Pao Chicken Lettuce Wraps.  I LOVE THEM!!!! Also, the hummus is very smoothe and the Moscow Mules are always on point!  

I still don't like the loudness and the uncomfy seating....but I'll deal.

Also, just learned they have a party room for private groups!  Good to know."}
{"text":"Our second visit. 6pm on a Friday, busy, but we were seated right away. Attentive waitstaff. We made it out for our movie in more than enough time. Great tap list, I had a kick in the head margarita special for Cinco de Mayo. My husband loved his burger, & I had amazing fish & chips. They are master fryers. Not greasy, salted just right. I was stuffed. I hate to say it, when we think of places to eat, we always forget about this place. Need to remember! It's been great both times visited."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on 10-13-16.  I ordered today's special, city chicken w/mashed potatoes and gravy.  It was served w/choice of two soups.  I chose tomato bisque.  The soup was really good and plenty hot enough.  The city chicken and potatoes were really quite good but were not served as hot as I think appropriate.  I didn't complain, though, as it was too tasty to send back to be reheated.  Wait staff told me it's made in-house.  Very tender and flavorful.  Price: moderate.  Portion size: more than adequate.  Atmosphere: a casual and clean diner feel to it.  Nice and quiet.  I didn't hear any music or TVs blaring away.  Good service.  Nice burger selections on the menu.  Ample parking.  I'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Ambiance is nice - it's a bit dark, a mix of modern and old school diner look.  Fries are really good and plenty.  Burgers are good too, hearty.  Dessert was very good.  I would come back."}
{"text":"Super FroYo and WONDERFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE!
I have to keep gluten-free when I have guests after a late night with a few cocktails Fast Eddies is my go-to to get them fed. Quality food, great customer service.
I tend to order through Foodler, the delivery times they provide are not reliable. Blame goes to Foodler not Fast Eddies. Food has always come at appropriate temperatures even if well after Foodler's given ETA. 
I am so jealous of the those who can eat gluten. I had to give away the food I order last night, as Foodler had the delivery time off and my guests were craving sleep more than food at that point. Their Uber arrived like 30 seconds before the delivery. Anyway I gave the cake to my neighbor over coffee SHE MOANED eating it. 
That is high praise indeed. Her only complaint was that the portion was too big and as it was so good she was going to finish it anyway."}
{"text":"It's open for a year and upon purchase of an entree got the ho ho cake for $1 and it was a perfect end to the dinner. The quesadilla comes with guac and sour cream as well as the salsa on the side. The cocktails were reasonably priced. Southside wasn't sweet but the cerinopolitan was a tad bit too sweet. 
The spicy shrimp taco was tasty but lacked spice and so did the chicken fried chicken meal. The latter comes with the gravy, mashed potatoes and baked beans. They have a kids menu and the grilled cheese was devoured by the young one. 
The service was fast, courteous and efficient. Prices are reasonable. Wasn't too busy on a Saturday evening. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I have recently been back since my last review and menu has been revised and expanded.  Great new selection of burgers and chicken sandwiches as well as an updated entrée menu.  As usual the food is excellent.  The Big Ed burger is fantastic."}
{"text":"First time dining at Fast Eddie's tonight and all and all it was a great experience. First stop was at the bar while waiting for a table the service wasn't super impressive but the drinks made up for it as it was by far one of the best Moscow Mules I've ever had. 

After a drink we got seated the onion rings as an appetizer which were delicious and are a must try. The carrot kielbasa soup was also fantastic...don't let the weirdo combo scare you it's a great soup. Our entrees were the Chicken & Bacon Mac & Cheese and Bourbon Glazed Meatloaf which the mac & cheese was okay but nothing really to write home about. The meatloaf was pretty great and I would recommend. Again the service was nothing to special and there wasn't the diner feel we were expecting.

One thing that would be a nice addition besides more personable servers would be milkshakes! It would give it more of a diner feel and who doesn't love a good milkshake!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere with oldies diner music. Service was good as well. West Coast Chicken Burger and sweet potato fries were good"}
{"text":"They just opened a month ago, so it has a new smell to it, a very strong new smell.  I could not smell the food and we sat right next to the kitchen (weird)!  I do have to say all the food did look great as we saw it come out.  The straws for our soft drinks were thin bar types, so not so good to drink from. Our salad came after our meal so their timing wasn't so good. Our waitress was attentive but didn't know the menu very well and couldn't answer our questions that we had.  I might visit again?"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  Wife and daughter had the Classic Cheese Burger, cooked to order but very small for $11.  I had the Beer Battered Fish & Chips ($9), it was good but I only got one small piece of fish.  The micro cup of cole slaw was tasteless and really needed the salt and pepper on the table.  All remaining space on your plate is filled with small, overcooked fries.  I don't think that one of us got a fry that was more than an inch long.  Ketchup comes in 1 teaspoon plastic cups.  The $1 Ho Ho Cake dessert special was the hit of the meal."}
{"text":"Disappointed that half the menu not being available until after 4pm - then don't give us that menu which stated available all day!  Everything we want was on that list. No one told us differently when they gave us the menus only when we went to order ;-( Ended up having to settle on other items. The food we got was good. Had a Cobb salad that definitely was worth it and husband had a burger that he said was an 8 out of 10.  So only advice to the restaurant is separate the menus so we don't know what we can't have and all will be good ;-)"}
{"text":"We had a great experience tonight when we went. Didnt wait longer than 15 mins for a seat and the place was packed. Server was extremely friendly and immediately greated us upon sitting down. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Food came out in about 10 minutes. Burgers were hot and fries were fresh. I got the cowboy burger with mashed potatoes and onion straws on top. My husband had the cocky swine burger. Both were fantastic. We also had a beer and I got a Kentucky Mule. No skimping on the burboun thats for sure. Definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good I would definitely recommend this to all my friends because the food here is very good this restaurant has great milkshakes and the burgers are very good the service is also very good the waiter and waitress is always give you refills and are quick with your dinner"}
{"text":"Decor is a bit cold. Service could have been better. I ordered a specialty drink & it was OK. Food was great though. Ordered a BLT with fries. Fresh bread, thick bacon. Fries were fresh & well seasoned. Boyfriend ordered a burger. He said it was really good. They don't slack on their burgers. Would probably return for the food."}
{"text":"Great mushroom burger.  The beef was tasty and cooked to perfection.  Fries were cooked just like my Dad makes.  My wife had the meatloaf and loved it.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"The food and service have slipped here. 

Wife got the bourbon bbq meatloaf and proclaimed it to be good (I thought it was dry). I had the chicken paprikash and as much as I wanted to like it, it was terrible. The sauce had an almost fish stock flavor, the paprika was an afterthought, and the spaetzles were very overcooked. The green beans with garlic were just that. Nothing special here.

Drinks we ordered took much longer than necessary to be served, as the place was not even 25% full. The JGB that I ordered was ok but had too much lime. Wife had the blackberry bourbon smash, and while good, the straws were absolutely useless because of the blackberries."}
{"text":"I was in the area the other night so I decided to meet up with a friend at Fast Eddie's. I must say it was a pleasant evening. We were seated right away and our server, Emily, was awesome. Very friendly and patient, just on top of her game. 

For food I got the meatloaf dinner $13. This came with fresh tasting garlic green beans, legit homemade mashed potatoes, brown gravy, and meatloaf with some fried onion straws on it. Generous portion sizes. I also got a side of their coleslaw $3. I ended up with two meals. Now I have had better meatloaf (the kind my mom makes), but I still thought everything was tasty. 

I'll keep this review simple; the food is good, nice portion sizes, reasonable prices. I will continue to come here. Oh and watch out for their daily specials like chicken paprikash or Tex-Mex mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"Good food, and good service. Nice, rustic, modern atmosphere with plenty of room to roam. Nice sized bar and good options all around"}
{"text":"My husband & I came here recently.  We both decided on the Chicken Fried Chicken.  It was delicious.  The entree came with mashed potatoes & fresh garlic green beans!!  The food was as great as the presentation!!  Can't wait to try the meatloaf!!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED

I like this place. It has good burgers,cocktails, salads, milkshakes, fries...you get it :) The prices are average ($15 give or take for burgers with side). The only things I'm not wild about are the atmosphere and the service.

Atmosphere: Open, modern warehouse feel. When I type that, I like it...but it just doesn't translate here for me. It ends up being cold, not cozy.

Service: Our servers here have never been stellar. I would say rather slow, inattentive...strange...a je ne sais quoi of mediocrity.

Overall, I'd recommend this place. The bar is cool so go and get a delish Manhattan and tuck into some comfort food :)"}
{"text":"The service seems to go down every time I visit. The hostess was smiling and friendly but the waitress was just, I don't know, there I guess. No smiles and very disinterested voice, it was like she didn't want to be there at all. 

I usually order a cheeseburger which is pretty good but I switched it up and tried the fried chicken sandwich. The chicken tasted really good, although pretty dry, and the shape and some bits of pretty hard crispness kinda make it hard to eat as a sandwich. I just took the bread off and ate just the chicken. 

Ordered a side of ranch but it's definitely not normal ranch, it really tastes like tartar sauce which is weird. 

It was pretty slow while we there so the kitchen staff didn't have much to do. They were all walking around talking, messing around, they weren't being loud or obnoxious but some of them were drinking from cups around where the food is prepared and served. I've worked in kitchens and this was always a big no-no, especially to place your cup with no lid on it right next to customers food getting ready to be served. 

I usually visit here, get a little disappointed each time, wait a couple months and then visit again. So I'll probably be back to try again in a few months."}
{"text":"Finally Parma has an awesome modern food restaurant with hometown food as well. The burger I had was juicy, flavorful, and wasn't over powered by the toppings which were straight from food network. Onion rings are the best, perfect crispy rings with delicious sauces. Beer selection was smaller than some places but exceptional. Must try as long as they don't change anything!!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers and onion rings. I recently had the Cuban sand and it was excellent paired with their homemade potato salad that was topped with bacon and green onions!!  Service is excellent and the bar is great to hang out at. One of the best places to eat in Parma!"}
{"text":"Decide to come here and give it a try 

We ordered the potato skins as an appetizer and they were good

I ordered 2 shrimp tacos and a cup of the cream of turkey soup. Both were good 

My husband had the BBQ Meatloaf sandwich with onion rings and a root beer float. He enjoyed his sandwich a lot. The onion rings were really good. We did ask for a side of goddess sauce and that was yummy!!

Our server was nice and did a good job. 

My only complaint was that everything was a little rushed - we came in at 8p and they closed at 9p, however, at 8:30 all their staff came in for a meeting so that's why they rushed"}
{"text":"Went in today for a late lunch/ early dinner. Ordered the onion rings, and portabella melt with roasted Brussel sprouts. I also got the pink flamingo drink. 
1. I'm not sure the drink had booze in it. No kick at all.
2. Sprouts were cooked perfectly but, a touch oily. 
3. The flavor in the sandwich didn't need the cheese. My advice? Skip the cheese.
4. The onion rings were perfect. Get the green goddess sauce!!
All in all I'll be back but, I'll skip the cheese.
Waitress was great btw!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Fast Eddies! We came in for lunch around 1130 on a Saturday. Only a couple tables were taken but it picked up quite a bit by the time we left. 

The food was delicious. We can vouch for the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, French fries, onion rings and burgers.

Service was quick. We timed how long it took for our food to come after we ordered; my son wanted to know if Fast Eddies was really \"fast\". It took 12 minutes.

The wait staff used teamwork to take care of us. All of our refills and condiment requests were fulfilled quickly.

The cost was a little higher than I expected for our neighborhood. For two entrees and two kids meals and drinks, it was about $60 with tip.

We will definitely be returning to Fast Eddies and recommending to friends."}
{"text":"Delicious food and appetizers and even better cocktails. Get the Parma sunrise, you won't regret it. The service was wonderful, the bartender was our server and she did a fantastic job though I sadly can't remember her name. Such a great spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome Cubano and whoever came up with Swedish Meatball Soup deserves a Nobel Peace Prize!"}
{"text":"Owned by the Cerino family this place offers upscale American dishes. They have a huge bar and patio too!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food. Clean. 1/2 sandwiches at lunch time are as big as a regular sandwich at home!"}
{"text":"Went there today for an early dinner with my wife, decor was industrial and with only 6 tables of people it was very loud. Our waitress was fantastic, very nice lady. Had Eddie's Favorite and the SO had the Short Rib stuffed burger, both were on-par with B-Spot and Burger Fi. $29 for 2 two burgers and fries was a bit much, especially in the run down parmatown area. Probably will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Eddie Cerino is known for his restaurants in Northeast Ohio. Fast Eddies takes traditional American fare and adds a nice twist. 

I had the peanut butter burger. It came with bacon and pickle slices. 

The beef was cooked to perfection. You get a choice of sides and I stuck with the hand cut French fries. Absolutely wonderful and they give a generous portion. 

My wife had the Eddie Burger. She devoured it so I'll take take that as a good sign. 

We got a slice of the homemade cheesecake and melted with joy!

I also enjoyed the shake of the day:  Fruity Pebbles. 

The price point for Fast Eddies is comparable to the chain casual dining places. 

Eat local, eat amazingly fresh. Eat Fast Eddies."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times.  They have brunch, lunch, and dinner.  I LOVE their burgers.   I usually try their burger of the month. Also they have great sweet potato fries.

They also have a small party room which we have used many times.  It is nice."}
{"text":"Their food is great!! I just wish that they would have more options!"}
{"text":"One of my most favorite places to eat! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. A few of my favorites remain to be the onion rings, the Kung Po lettuce wraps, the peanut butter burger and the blue plate special Sunday chicken. You will find consistency in everything they do. They most recently added brunch on Sunday's which is also tasty which a variety of options for the savory and the sweet brunch eater! If you sit at the bar you will most likely have John serving you and you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"I figured that I would get a basic grilled cheese and tomato soup to try them out.  Soup tastes like it came from a can and grilled cheese was bland enough for my 4 year old.  Just plain American cheese on sour dough.  Disappointed and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was also hoping for the old fast Eddie food experience and was disappointed.  Overpriced!!!  I had a burger that was just ok ( roll would have better warm)with sweet potato fries that were not worth the up charge  My husband had fish and chips... Fish was huge but had a heavy batter and was under- seasoned and the tartar sauce was a dill sauce that tasted horrible.  His fries looked like potato scraps.  My son had the salmon which lacked sufficient glaze and was also under seasoned.  Onion rings appetizer was ok, though nothing special. Bill was around $80 with no cocktails!  The server was attentive and was the best thing about our visit.  Stick to their other restaurants... They are very good!"}
{"text":"Always great food. Their burgers can't be beat. I put them up against B Spot any day and I love B Spot. Their soup is always delish too. The menu has a good variety so there is something for everyone. The daily specials are not to be missed. True city chicken with pork and veal - hard to find but one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Review of one given solely because of how they serve draft headhunter: literally every restaurant or bar i go serves in either pint or larger: fast eddies says anything over 8 abv server in
Sniffer 12z glass: if mgt reads this please take nite this is why my wife and I got just one beer each and will avoid your place in future if we want beer with a quick meal.  You price this beer high but give less than every other business in town.  Is your business greedy or do they just not know how to operate?"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The service was promt & polite. The atmosphere was very nice & the food was excellent. We love homemade onion rings & the batter was just right. The burgers & fresh cut fries were on point as well. Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Fast Eddie's is a great local diner. The decor is trendy, the food is delicious and the service is always fast and friendly. My favorite go tos are the fried chicken sandwich (crispy and delicious with French onion mayo) the London burger (perfect with their mustard aioli) and their beef stroganoff (it's only a sometimes special you should not pass up)! They're also great for Sunday brunch with an amazing chorizo quesadilla. This restaurant is helping revive the old Parmatown area and is a must go to restaurant when you're in town!"}
{"text":"Husband's and I first time there. really enjoyed the food. Had summer sangria and it was awesome.the appetizer came out quick and we didn't have a long wait on the food. The service was great. Our server was attentive and friendly. Would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"inedible, the greasiest food in town.. dripping onion rings, and greasy perogies. Nice service, just bad food"}
{"text":"Solid food, solid service at Fast Eddie's. I had the fish & chips and it was good. The fish was light and flaky and the batter was a little on the soft side.  Lord knows we all love crunch fish batter.  Amirite?  

Everyone liked their meals, especially Sophie, who ate a burger that had the mashed potatoes built right in!

My son enjoyed his chicken tenders and fries, as per usual.  My wife really liked her Buffalo Chicken sammi.  

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner tonight. I love the atmosphere. Our waitress Crystal was adorable and on point. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table but it was worth it. The cornbread was delicious. We wanted more of the apricot jam to take home! The burger was cooked perfectly and has great flavor. My boyfriend had the chicken fried special and I had a few bites and it was great as well. Definitely be back. Only suggestion is get more wit beers and hefewizens on the drink menu."}
{"text":"First met me start with that this is not the fast eddies that I grew up with. This place is trading on local nostalgia while delivering the consumer with a high-end dining experience. To say this is a blast from the past would be a fallacy. This is a completely new dining experience an Old-Timers like me should keep an open mind. When I was there they did not have Chile perhaps that has changed in the months that have passed. The prices are astronomically High but one gets what they paid for as the quality of the food is as high as the prices. I would recommend this place for anyone that is having a large Gathering of friends and or family may be business associates as they have a superb party room. For what it's worth keep up the good work Fast Eddie's! The only reason I didn't give you higher ranks as I thought your prices were too high."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, casual, relaxing. Eddie has done it again.  Delicious. The Cerino family name has a new representative of dining excellence.  This one has a different theme than any of the others but captures Eddie's passion for good taste and a variety of menu options to satisfy anyone who is looking for excellence in dining.  

 For such a new restaurant, we were impressed with the prossionalism of the staff and the speed of service.

The bar has an eclectic selection of beers and wines (plus the usual ones for the unadventurous), and a nice selection of mixed drinks. 

This is a one of a kind eatong establishment which seems to have already become our new favorite."}
{"text":"First time at fast eddies was Sunday and happened to be Mother's Day. They had a special menu for the occasion. I had the Irish omelette and the girlfriend had chicken and waffles. The omelette was good and the chicken and waffles were pretty tasty as well. Service was good and the food was satisfying. Nothing spectacular however."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef hash and it was great. Real corned beef not the cheap stuff. Portions are large and filling."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Food is really good and it came out pretty fast but not too fast.  Our server Crystal was very knowledgeable and friendly.  Would highly recommend dining here."}
{"text":"I went there again recently for dinner and I must say the portion sizes are much better!  You get so many fries that I could barely finish my meal.  Also that happy hour is SO freaking good.  Drinks are cheap, delicious apps, all-around good atmosphere!  The happy hour burger is cheap and the same size as a regular one so well worth it!! The onion rings are to die for.  And the summer drink menu is refreshing, lots of flavored mojitos and summer beers on tap!"}
{"text":"This place breathes a flow of fresh air into the stagnant air of chain restaurants and closed shops that is Parmatown. Have I had a better burger? Yes. However, this place is exactly what Parma needs. It's not just about the burgers here for me; it's about having a casual place nearby that isn't frozen patties and fries. I can get excited about going to this place; I can look forward to specials and changes...something I cannot say about many places in the area. The taps seem like they will change often as well, so I'm looking forward to seasonal selections throughout the year. While the burgers aren't the absolute best I've ever had, they're darn tasty. 

My SO and I started with the bacon wrapped dates. They were a bit small, but it's not a bad portion size for just two people. While really good, we both wished that they were stuffed with something delicious rather than just topped with a bunch of sauce we didn't need. I also ordered the Eddie's Favorite burger. The initial shock of a $13 price tag quickly faded when I saw the mountain of fresh cut fries it came with. The burger patty itself was fabulous, but the sauteed mushrooms and onions were a little greasy for my taste. My SO ordered the cowboy burger; while I'm not a fan of mashed potatoes on a burger, his was not greasy at all...it's all in the toppings. I'd recommend not opting to pay the extra $1.50 for the sweet potato fries unless you really despise regular fries. The portion size was tiny compared to my regular fries, and the \"sriracha ketchup\" was a goopy ketchup-mayo hybrid that did not satisfy. 

The thing that completely sold me about Fast Eddie's was the banana cream pie. It's a thick square of custard, fresh banana, homemade whipped cream, and crunchy banana chips. The crust is topped with a layer of chocolate adding extra decadence. That pie is what dreams are made of, and I would go to this place just to order it. The burgers are a 8/10, but the service and pie were a 10/10!"}
{"text":"Kids menu is $5 and my kids burgers were big and delicious. I had the Cubano. Though it was on a hoagie roll instead of Cuban bread, the taste and meat was good. Trio appetizer came with great pita, hummus, and lots of nice deli style olives. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Exspensive  and I  had the kung pow chicken lettuce  wraps and got physically ill I will not be returning  thankyou"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! Saturday afternoon Not very busy. Munched on beer battered onion rings. Tasty. Ordered the Italiano. Tasted like a Roman burger but better. My son had the London. We cut in half and swapped to share. Good burgers
Good fries. Our server was amazing!!! She was awesome! Good stuff. Only complaint prices a little steep for 7oz burgers."}
{"text":"Eh..overpriced and nothing special! 

I started with a house salad w/Italian vinaigrette dressing. It was trying to be a 'fancy' salad and missed the mark. The dressing had no taste at all!

My aunt and I shared the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and it was pretty good but I could definitely find better food at cheaper prices elsewhere in the area. 

I'm bummed because I was excited for Fast Eddies to be back! :-("}
{"text":"Me and a friend decided to check this place out. Emily and Jasmine were great and very knowledgeable. Food is PHENOMENAL. Great family business. Love the pink flamingo accents throughout the restaurant, makes it very personalized. Will definitely return again and I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"First visit very disappointing.  Asked for extra crispy bacon on my BLT and was told I got it when delivered to my table. Their idea of crispy is my idea of barely cooked. Won't be back any time soon."}
