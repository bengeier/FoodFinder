{"text":"Always great friendly service and fresh baked bread and desserts everyday.   Highly recommend the custard cakes they are the closest thing I have ever tried to the original Pastéis de Belém in Lisboa    The rice flour cake is also really good and a good option for those whom do not like cake too sweet.    The bean cakes are great here too!  orange, almond, and a few others I have tried are all good.    Can't go wrong with Nova Era"}
{"text":"Desserts and bread are always great at Nova Era. Customer service is terrible.   Desserts always a great variety and always fresh.   Couple recommendations; custard cakes, bean cakes are all amazing!    Customer service.... After waiting in line for 15mins with only two people in front of me I was told to go to the other counter to order my sandwich.... After ignoring me for another 10mins the extremely rude woman making sandwiches doesn't even greet me and in a very unfriendly manner tells me to basically go sit down and now wait to be asked what I want.   20mins pass and I am still here sitting and waiting to have someone approach me to take an order. I will never be coming back here to eat and HIGHLY recommend only coming for the bakery stuff only here!    Terrible fucking service."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for the past few years and love this place, unfortunately about 3 hours ago their rude staff got the best of me when I brought clients to discuss a brief over coffee (at their request).  I brushed it off more than a few times in my years of being a patron thinking it might have just been a bad day for whoever was working. I've worked in similar situations and understand that you can't always be perfect but this was just unacceptable. I'm talking huffing and puffing, rolling their eyes & slamming cups! Not once, but TWICE when my clients ordered.  I was absolutely mortified!  I had to apologize to my clients for even suggesting the place.  I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It is a very cozy place in its own style which i liked.The prices are really reasonable and it is a good place to get together with your friends but in a small group. The stuff were really kind and the latte was delicious with a side of fresh cookie.  I am so happy to find a Nova Era in my neighborhood in Mississauga after i went there for the first time :)"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood, and it's really a love/hate relationship. Depending on the time of day, the people working, or the people inside, your experience can definitely change. Many of the staff are rude or unaware that their presence is needed, and sometimes they pretend dealing with something in the back is more important than serving. I buy bread here, mostly because it's easier than going to the grocery store. But sometimes I would rather go all the way to the store to avoid this place. Obviously they have the custard tarts that everyone loves, but their other pastries are so mehhh. As a pastry lover, it's a bummer."}
{"text":"Came here to try the Portuguese tarts after hearing so much about them, and came out a bit disappointed. The tarts came cold, but we asked the waiter to heat them up and he was happy to do so. The tarts reminded me of the ones that I've had from Macau, but less greasy. A bit too sweet for my liking, but the shell of the tart was very well done; the perfect amount of flakey and crispy!"}
{"text":"I love the beef cakes. They are a good size and delicious. The Brazilian Bakery has shrimp cakes and codfish but not beef. I also really enjoyed their cream filled pastry... so delicious!"}
{"text":"I was there this week, bought a sandwich which tasted fairly bland, and then used their restroom. To my surprise, upon opening the door of the restroom, I turned the lights on to cockroaches on the floor...scurrying around. Can't get the image out of my head. Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"Best Natas in the city- hands down. Lattes are also very good:)"}
{"text":"YUM is all I can say! This place has amazing griddled ham and cheese sandwiches-- they are to die for. The cheese melts in your mouth. Also, of course, don't forget to get their delicious Portuguese custard tarts!! Mmmmmm! Also very cheap. Great service although we were the only ones there :) love this bakery, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I enjoy Nova Era's food and coffee, however the service is not so good.  The staff seem over-worked and underpaid... They are always rushed and seem stressed out.  In addition, the server Always tries to overcharge us - so you have to be really careful as to what they are charging you for.  Specifically, they may try to add coffee drinks to your bill, when you only had 2, they will try to charge you for 3.  This usually happens when upper-management is working, but not as much when the regular joes are working.  It has happened so much that i've stopped going in, even though their food and bread is SO GOOD!  Fresh Warm Bread at 3$ a loaf is pretty great, and if the staff didn't chronically overcharge us, I'd be a regular customer."}
{"text":"Popped in during Dundas Street West festival and found seats with excellent Portuguese tarts (as usual!) and served delicious lattes."}
{"text":"Having a delicious bakery that is open both early and late in your neighborhood is wonderful.  If you want to grab a coffee before you commute to work, it's open.  If you want to meet up for a slice of carrot cake at 10:30pm with a friend, it's open.  This is what Nova Era means to me.  Not only do they offer a great range of fresh baked breads and pastries, they also have wonderful sandwiches and salads.  My personal favorite is a turkey panini or the Nova Era club sandwich.  Both are very generous and their sandwiches range from around $4 - $7 each.  With drip coffee or tea just a dollar or two, you're looking at a very inexpensive meal.  Since this is a Portugese bakery, you will also find some portugese specialties like pada bread and nata (custard tarts).  Try one, you will not regret.  One warning that goes along with the low prices - this is not a fancy uppity coffeehouse.  Soy milk is not an option, and I actually dare you to ask for anything \"half-caf\" or \"skinny\".  They do offer delicious espresso-based drinks, but they keep them nice and simple  - and thus, reasonably priced.    Try: a nata tart, the sourdough baguette, the mini cheesecakes (strawberry or oreo for just $2!), deli sandwiches. At your own risk: I'm not a big fan of the cake slices or some of the sweet desserts like eclairs, but you might enjoy them just fine."}
{"text":"all your nova era sandwich belongs to us   (lol at \"please confirm your language as english\" when posting this)  -- ok nova era bakery makes yummy portuguese bread cold cut sandwiches with lettuce and tomato and cheese and whatever you want that they have all toasted it is magnificent!! also, the yummiest doughnuts. and cakes... yeah cakes. and flan, and its a good bakery for sure."}
{"text":"In my opinion, Nova Era makes one of the best Portuguese egg tarts (Pasteis De Natas) in the city. (The consistently best ones are to be found at a place on 9th line in Markham...but that's another story) I always pick up a box whenever I'm nearby. I use them as bargaining chips with my girlfriend :P"}
{"text":"Classic three-and-a-bit stars. A resounding 'it was quite good but could be much better' verdict.   Maybe my expectations were too high. I had heard great things about the relative cosiness of this café (seriously, why is it such a rarity in Toronto to have cafes with sofas and armchairs????) and its value for money. As such, I didn't mind travelling some distance on a lazy Saturday wanting to try it out.  The 'cosiness' let me down a bit. Although having two small tables surrounded by sofas and armchairs is impressive by Toronto's generally utilitarian 'grab n go' style cafes, it still wasn't anything remarkable. That being said, a cosy chair is a cosy chair and I jumped right in alongside my amazingly-priced Americano (2.45 for a medium) and crème donut (99 cents!)  The espresso in the coffee was really good and a nice change from the bitter dark roasts which are so popular these days. The espresso was slightly sweet in what tasted like a medium-to-dark roast. Really good and refreshing. The crème donut was a really generous size for the price and quite delicious - crispy on the outside with sugary, thick cream on the inside.   The prices were pretty outstanding. As well as the 99 cents crème donut, Nova Era offer breakfast sandwiches for 2.50, HUGE slabs of tiramisu for just 2.20 and lunch wraps and sandwiches for something around the 4 dollar mark. I literally thought I was seeing things! Absolutely fantastic value to be found here on all products.   Unfortunately, the service was unwelcoming and generally poor. It was my first time in the café and I wanted to browse the menu and the baked goods and see what was on offer before ordering. I was put under pressure to order ASAP even though the place wasn't busy. Despite the fact that it was a very cold day outside, I was craving an iced coffee. I noticed the menu listed iced cappuccinos and iced coffee, so I was a bit taken aback when I ordered an iced coffee and was sharply told ''we don't have that.'' Ok. Maybe take it off the menu then? The donut and Americano was brought to the table in surly silence by another staff member, and when I went to pay at the till, there was a bit of hullaballoo about me having to produce a receipt listing the items that I ordered. This wouldn't have bothered me, only I never received a receipt initially when the food was delivered to the table, so all the drama about asking me to show them one was a bit awkward.   The entire place was a bit grimy and the walls could definitely use a repainting. The fact that customers have to be 'buzzed' into the washroom by staff sort of contributes to the grimy, anti-customer friendly feel.  The produce was very good and the prices were great. If I lived nearby, I think I would definitely be a regular in the mornings for a take-out coffee and treat.  But the general vibe of the staff and atmosphere of the café ensures that I won't be in a rush to return here for some leisurely weekend laziness any time soon. Easily a four-star for a take-out place, but considerably less if you want a more relaxing experience - which I definitely did the day I visited."}
{"text":"Nova era has always been my favourite bakery. I have been going to this bakery of years now! It is located across the street from my house. My favourite items to buy are the sandwiches toasted..best ever! I love there custard cakes and cakes pretty much everything!"}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever had from this bakery are the Portuguese Egg Tarts (Pasteis de Nata) and they are solid.  I like these ones better than other places, because they are caramelized a little more on top. The pastry is flaky, crisp, and chewy. A winning combination for sure.  My friend brought Egg Tarts for me from Pasteis de Belem in Lisbon a while back, and these come very close to the quality of that product, if not better.  Best you eat them the same day they are purchased, so that the pastry doesn't go stale on you."}
{"text":"I was a regular at Nova Era, until I finally decided I was fed up with their awful service. The employees often look right through you and take a while to acknowledge your presence when you walk in. They rarely thank you and will often decline to respond when you thank them.   The atmosphere of the place is such that you get restless after being in there for two minutes and feel the need to leave. Depressing, in short.   Their pastries, sandwiches and coffee are decent but, given the options in the neighbourhood, the poor service cancels their products out. It also doesn't help that they were observed chasing away a homeless woman who wanted to eat the day-old bread they left on the street corner. They did this with brooms in hand, as if she were a pigeon.   Nova Era has loyal customers and don't appear the least bit concerned to expand their clientele beyond that base.  They've lost my business after almost a year and don't appear to be the type of place that would wonder why. You get what you give, and the staff here simply don't give a salty prosciutto about friendly service."}
{"text":"This Nova Era wasn't as good as the one I usually go to on Geary! They seem to make their sandwiches with less love. Still, the baking is pretty much the same but I not as fresh as the Geary Headquaters.   I still LOVE Nova Era, but not as much this location."}
{"text":"I like the sour dough bagette, its well priced and a nice alternative to the standard Portuguese style bread in the neighborhood.  Only thing I don't like is the service is often slow and not overly friendly."}
{"text":"have been going here for years.. up until a couple of weeks ago, my mother purchased Massa from here, and found a rock!! she went and complained and the girl simply said she would show the people who bring them in (since they aren't made there)."}
{"text":"Coffee was good however the giant chocolate cookie was very dry and crumbled apart. Service was confusing as well"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here. They severed me old cake (the cream was rancid), when I tried to make a comment about it the girl at the counter rolled her eyes. ... very unconcerned staff. The guy who took my order was fine but the other women I dealt with not so much. I am not coming back to this location anytime soon! !! Yuck"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the neighbourhood portuguese places. Nova Era falls into this category. While rebuilding by house I was always there getting their famous Tosta Mista (a ham and cheese sandwich toasted) for only $4. You could walk in and out of there with a full lunch including one of their signature portuguese tarts for only about $6.  Nowadays I'm in their all the time getting their baguettes and pada buns, which they are constantly baking. Most of the time you can pick up a loaf of bread and it's still hot.  Yes, the staff can be rushed there, and sometimes a little brash, (ie. serving the locals before the english speakers), but it's worth it. Go for the good bread. Happy to have this place around."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for dirt cheap food and bad coffee. Free wifi and no judgement. I like the mix of old Portuguese women and construction workers. Good times!!!"}
{"text":"I used to go there after I went to the music store. I always like Brazilian custard puddling and it is hard to find it in Toronto. Nova Era has it. They have good coffee and good sandwich for very reasonable price. I would definitely recommend my friends to have a good place to have snacks at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I was craving some Portuguese tarts and I was glad to stumble on this cute gem of a place! Nice service and tasty tarts! Ridiculously affordable!!"}
{"text":"Good pastries and desserts. Awful awful coffee. They pull the espresso shots, go off and do other things, by the time you get it it's gone bitter. Not to mention the water they use is practically boiling. Also, there was a naked homeless man last time I was there. Very awkward but I'm sure that isn't a regular thing!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite things are Portuguese Egg Tarts. When I discovered that they were available right around the corner from where I was staying, I couldn't be happier.  As I entered the bakery, there it was, in the glass case near the door: a whole heaping tray of the golden yellow egg tarts!! I got in line right away and ordered one dozen. All for myself. Because when else would I be able to eat all these tarts?   I brought them back to my place, heated one up, and indulged in a delicious custard-egg filled tart. The custard's consistency was just perfect, and not too sweet. The layers of flaky pastry crust was light and so buttery.   These were so good that I had to go back the next day. In case you were wondering, I didn't finish the initial dozen all to myself. I bought another half dozen, so that I could bring it back to Vancouver with me to enjoy the Portuguese goodness."}
{"text":"The pasteis de nata are so good. I popped back in this bakery before I left my Airbnb to buy some to bring home. There is a good amount of flakiness to the pastries, that accompany the filling perfectly, and they last long enough before they get soggy.  I also bought a baguette that was very delicious and soft, and a couple coffees here during my stay. The espresso was perfect for a morning or afternoon pick me up."}
{"text":"Delicious egg tart at a standard price of $1.25 ($1.30 with tax). The pastry part of the tart was much thinner than an usual tart, so you got more egg filling. Depends on what you like, more egg or more pastry!"}
{"text":"The custard tarts are ok but inferior to Venezia. Not as much depth of flavor, and crust is soggy."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto full time I had the luxury of inhabiting an apartment just around the corner from this family feeling bakery.  As Michael N. said, don't waste your time on packaged nata, Nova Era does it best. They are fresh, cheap and a perfect accompaniment to coffee. Other pastries are also gorgeous and fresh bread is never in short supply.  Always buzzing with Portuguese chatter, the chaos is somehow comforting. If you're lucky enough to pass by on a regular basis then step in and enjoy. Little Portugal shines her best through the shop windows of Nova Era"}
{"text":"I've posted a pic of my favourite snack at Nova Era, the cabbage soup with fresh, melt-in-your-mouth Portuguese bun. The no-nonsense staff here are incredible and can almost read my mind as soon as I come in. They have table service off to the the left as you come in so there is no need to stand at the counter trying to decide what to have. I haven't seen a menu, but walking by the display cases will give you some great ideas. The pastries are delicious! The tarts of course, but I've also tried something that looked like a donut but was flakey pastry instead of dough, now that's a treat. The seating area is spacious and pleasant with a combination of modern and vintage rolled into a very comfortable experience. I had the pleasure of sitting at the one table in the corner front (to your left as you walk in) which is directly in front of a huge picture window with an amazing view of Dundas looking west (see my pic). A lottery ticket kiosk sits unassumingly on the wall to your left as you come in. On the right of the til is another large seating area that has comfy looking couches, similar to a suburban rec room, with a large serving opening from the kitchen area facing the room. What a concept! I could live here. There is even some kind of a funky oven in the back of the room that looks functional although I haven't seen it in operation. See my pics. (And next door is a great beer store). The coffees offered are the old school versions of what Starbucks tries to sell you as trendy and cool, but here they are no big deal, just part of the experience and not overpriced so you can have more than one. That's the way these people roll and I LOVE THAT!"}
{"text":"Tried the mocha eclair, tiramisu, and canoli. They were really stale and dry. Quite disappointing because they looked amazing."}
{"text":"my daily coffee habit dealer!"}
{"text":"Love this location!  They are much friendlier than the Dundas West location, and the patio and large windows make for overall a much nicer bakery experience.    Vanilla cream doughnut!!  So delicious.  Everything looks amazing and the prices are incredible value for the freshness.  I want to try everything and 3 pants sizes later, I will be able to review everything in more detail.  For now, I'll just have to say I love the doughnuts and olive bread.  The coffee is excellent too."}
{"text":"These guys got a wheelchair ramp! Same relaxing atmosphere the usual good coffee."}
{"text":"Decent little bakery on St Clair near the community center and Earlscourt park. Since the gf and I got a new dog this has been our spot for coffee and pastries.   Very decent pastry selection and everything is labelled along with prices. Yum yum. One giant apple turnover, one big donut and two coffees was $7.   The place is always packed and has a certain Portuguese flair. If you want plain old drip coffee make sure to ask for it \"Canadian\""}
{"text":"You don't go to Nova for fast service. You go for tosta mistas and coffee and Portuguese baked goods. Lots of interesting neighbors and local character. The pastries are good and even though it took a while to get my sandwich, it was also delicious.!"}
{"text":"We came up to Toronto from Buffalo for an event and popped in to the bakery for lunch. It was late in the day so our selection of bread was understandably more limited. But there was a wide array of sandwich options, as well as plenty of lovely looking pastries in the cases. The girls working there were quite friendly and the service was excellent. I was impressed that when I ordered egg salad, she made it fresh right then. Most places (at least in the States) keep egg salad pre-made. It was not busy when we came in, though there were other customers who had already been helped and who were sitting enjoying their food. I could see how it might get crowded during a busy time of day but that's no different than any other smaller bakery or deli. On the whole, we would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I love European bakeries and have an affinity for family run Portuguese ones predominantly for one thing, Portuguese tarts!   They may look like Chinese egg tarts that have been accidentally burnt to a crisp, but they maybe one of the most omnomeriffic (tm) things in the world.  I was introduced to my first tart as a child by some Portuguese related family of mine and I've been addicted to them ever since.  On my recent trip to Macau, I went on a crazy hunting trip for these little suckers where some of the best in the world are made.  Unfortunately THE most well known place there \"Annie's Bakery\" was closed, but I still packed in 3 or 4 from several places (and if you happen to know the calorie count for these bad boys you'd know that's about a days worth).  The ones from Nova here are as favourably comparable to any of the ones I had in Macau.  They're crispy, light, and the filling wasn't ridonckulously sweet.  Best part is they serve \"Canadiana Coffee\" a la Tim Hortons like coffee, but if you're a connoisseur they have traditional espresso's, latte's and other italian/french sounding names for coffee.  If I was retired and living in the neighbourhood, I'd be there every day and have one of these bad boy tarts till my heart explodes so I could die in a yummy peace."}
{"text":"Love their Portuguese tarts, perfect custard filling with a crispy croissant like pastry.   This seems like a local join, with many patrons knowing the servers by name. There are also scratch cards available for purchase by the door. Neat!"}
{"text":"Wow. Fresh partries, huge selection of incredibly delicious snacks and sumptuously fresh breads. Incredible pricing for the quality. Such a great place to go and pick out lots of tiny treats to try. You can choose 5 or 6 decadent little desserts for around $10. Tiny cheesecakes, gorgeous tarts, little decorated  slices of cake, cute chocolate shells full of tiramisu. No matter how inexpensive/tiny, each treat is beautiful and flavourful. No surprising or creative flavours here but old reliable baking recipes done right and wholesome full-on, full fat (gluten, white sugar, dairy, o yes!) oldworld creations. Great place to stock up for a picnic, potluck, or pick up dessert for a host/company.  I keep returning for the egg tarts (natas). They're outrageously delicous.. the shell is phenomenal: delicate, perfectly crunchy (intricately crafted when you examine it.. that swirl in the pastry at the bottom! swoon.). The filling is strongly sweet and  heady with vanilla with a rich, velvety yolky taste (so not the weird back of the throat old-scambled-eggy taste egg tarts can sometimes have). YEA!"}
{"text":"No attitude, and lots of light.  This is a place to catch up with friends.  Not to check your e-mail...although I'm sure they wouldn't mind.  Terrific desserts and tasty coffee, Nova Era is certainly my cafe of choice.  Saving Gigi is down the street, but to be honest, I'm not treated like I matter and I hated my experience there.  For me this is where the nice and not-so-cool kids come to sit down, relax and have a quick bite to eat.    Prices aren't too bad, but I'll keep coming back for the atmosphere.  On a nice sunny summer night the window open creating an amazing cross breeze through the place.  Enjoy this wonderful little cafe while you can!"}
{"text":"very good pastry but I was there near closing time and did not have much selection left. Must go back earlier"}
{"text":"How could a place so yummy be so cheap?! Seriously had one of the best coffees here and under $3. Egg tarts baked goods croquettes... all great afternoon or morning tea staples. I have been a few times. I always leave happy with crumbs sprinkled over my top!"}
{"text":"Well I've found another little gem and it's not italian!  This time around it's of the Portugese persuasion!  First of all when you open the door you are hit in the face with the most wonderful odor of fresh bread being baked! You walk in and there is a fridge filled to capacity of all kinds of colds cuts and cheeses and to your left fresh baked bread to go oh so good with the cold cuts.   Above the cash register there is a sign \"Best Coffee Served\" and believe me that is 100% the absolute truth.  Lets move on to the desserts - a fridge full of mouth watering custard tarts (their trademark) - now usually I am not a fan of custard but this is no way something I can pass up on each visit.  I highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"though i wish them sucess i was a regular at this place and rarely did i find help to be overly nice with a few exceptions a gentleman who works there but the women were never friendly and gave bare minimum service exchange. maybe because im asian and not portugese.  never have i ever brought race as an issue but i dont know what it is, i get this impression of it being uncomfortable and ackward and thats so rare for me to experience, ive never felt out of.place before.  its even strange for me to write this lol.  at the end of the day for companies to be great, customer service should be up to par.   food was okay not a huge selection but i did enjoy their hot sandwhiches and desserts.  probably wont go there as much since im out of the neighbourhood and only went there for comvience but who knows maybe id go back to meet a friend since its a casual place to hang out in mediocrity and really catch up on your girl talk without distractions."}
{"text":"Went here today for a bite. My friend ordered an espresso and we shared a tart. While the espresso was good and the tart was to my liking but not his (too dense/too heavy), what bothered me most about this place was the customer service.  As my friend looked at the different pastries, he had questions about one of them and asked one of the waitresses who was looking down and basically ignoring us. We didn't go away so she had to look up. He repeated his question, she proceeded to answer in Portuguese and another waitress who was nearby answered her in Portuguese and then answered our question... It's a bit hard to think you're not talking s*** about us in Portuguese when you do that.   There was a variety of tarts, my friend asked questions about a couple of them and decided on one with coconut. When he asked the waitress (3rd waitress in 5 minutes) what the tart was called (in Portuguese), she gave him this \"it's a coconut tart\" with a \"DUH!\" expression on her face.... OK, rude.  That made me not want to get anything, so I went to browse the breads. I figured picking my own bread wouldn't require as much interaction with the staff. So I pick a loaf, put it in a bag, put it on the counter. The waitress (4th one) at the counter is staring at me like \"what do you want?\". I push the bread her way without saying a word and with a \"DUH!\" smile on my face because, at that point, I've had it with the attitude. As I was waiting for her to go in the back to slice it up, I could see the difference of interaction between Portuguese customers and non Portuguese customers. Overall, the wait staff was annoyed at everyone and a bit rude, but the attitude improved a bit if you were Portuguese.  Needless to say, I will be going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Nice bakery with friendly staff and very cheap food&drinks. It is a great place to get a bread for home or to grab some of their delicisous pastries and a coffee.  There is more then bakery and pastry products they offer....salads, sandwiches, soups,... and beer too!"}
{"text":"First time trying this bakery, but definitely coming back. I was never pressured into choosing right away, the girl working there was super nice and let me take my time. She answered all of my questions about what dessert was which, or what was inside. I ordered 1 shrimp patty that was heated up, gave it a nice crunch. Also ordered a grilled chicken bacon sandwich that was being grilled in the little kitchen area, took longer then I expected. Ordered 6 Portuguese tarts to go. The sandwich tasted very good, the chicken had a lemony herb flavour, not your usual boring grilled chicken breast. I really liked the bread, sour dough that was chewy but not stale at all. Later tried the tarts and they were perfect combination of custard to flaky crust. So delicious! Will be back to grab more tarts and more patties! Prices are so affordable too!  TIP: They don't serve soup in the summer time!"}
{"text":"Portuguese tarts. My first was in Macau. I didn't appreciate it. I had one many years after, once I'd had what I like to call my \"foodie awakening\" and I regretted paying so little attention to my first. A friend of mine shared a Portuguese tart from Nova Era with me one day and it was delightful. The inside was wonderfully creamy and the crust was so incredibly flaky. It also wasn't too sweet, which I appreciated a lot. Be careful. If you aren't gentle with it, this dessert will fall apart when you bite it, but it's sooo worth it."}
{"text":"Came here w my boyfriend and his Portuguese family and we agreed these are the best egg tarts outside Portugal! Crispy and flaky crust and perfect amount of filling. Ask for some cinnamon to sprinkle on top and it's perfection.  I was so excited to try all the other pastries-- they were good but a little off. The toasted coconut tart and beer tart (w coconut egg and sugar) were calling my name, as was the deer hoof (coconut, custard, cinnamon) so I brought those home. The coconut tart and beer tarts had delicious fillings, but the crust was too tough. The deer hoof pastry was a little dry. Overall good flavors and I would actually order them again (and I'm picky).. Maybe those little things will be different next time!"}
{"text":"Strong delicious latte.  Mini Sagres beer from Portugal.   Tosta Mista, which is grilled ham and cheese sandwich are really good here.  Fresh bread baked here and traditional Portuguese sweets.  Great spot for a quick inexpensive lunch, beer and coffee."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   6 servers working 6 tables and the bakery counter - and my partner and I were the only table eating food, all others coffee only...and nobody came out to ANY of the tables the whole time we were there, to ask if anyone needed more coffee, if food was good, zip. Nothing. Gossiping and kvetching in between ringing out occasional bakery customer.   Went in at about 10:30am. Had (2) ham and cheese on toasted croissant sandwiches and a Portugese tart, with coffee.   Croissant was burnt black. Ham and cheese was cold and unmelted. Coffee barely hot.   Tart was ok. Unimaginative.   After 20 minutes of zero contact, not even eye contact, we split.   5 seconds after we walked from table, a server swooped over and cleaned table. Whew! For a second, I thought maybe we were invisible! HaHa"}
{"text":"After reading a few of the reviews; I get it.  The staff are \"stressed.\"  They really DO seem stressed. The two times that I've gone there, they have been pretty low energy.  I got a slice of cheesecake and it kinda sucked.  It wasn't bad enough to where I was gonna throw it away but I don't think it was worth the coin. I haven't tried anything else, but I'd imagine the coffee was at least decent because there were a few people drinking them (sans gag).  I dunno, I don't hate this place but I didn't really like  it. I wouldn't ever crave anything from there.  I would never be like, \"omg I need to have summa dat stale strawberry cheesecake right now!\" They have day old baked goods which is okay, but I didn't see any day-old cake so I wasn't THAT impressed. Meh! Three stars!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good but it was very clear I had no clue how their ordering process works and pretty sure that was clear given all of my questions. She asked what I wanted on the sandwich and I said everything but onions. I was charged 50 cents for every vegetable!! They should really mention that's extra when it's obvious I had never been there before. Needless to say, kinda shocked at the cash after I had eaten the sandwich and could have had something much better for 10!"}
{"text":"Took my mother-in-law (no jokes please she truly is a lovely lady!), to Nova Era yesterday mid-afternoon. I needed a late lunch and she needed a nice pastry.  This location smells wonderful. Just that indicates how great the bread will taste and it indeed does. They also have a nice assortment of pastries. If you  couple that with excellent coffee, you have a winning combination.  I had their Nova Era club sandwich, on a fresh ciabatta like bun. A well-travelled friend, with whom I lunched in Lisbon, got me turned on to Portuguese style baking. He asserted that the bread in that country was the best in Europe. I harrumphed, being a Francophile, but was proven wrong. They do say that \"the proof of the pudding is.....\".  This bakery just does that fantastic bread and nice interpretation of a club sandwich loaded with a breast of chicken. It was very delicious. My lunch companion had a 'mutant' chocolate croissant, with chocolate filling and drizzle. She took one half home as it was too much to finish.  She had an expresso which she said would \"wake up the dead\", and I had an Americano which was perfect. I have been there 3 times and its always consistent, simple and yummy!  They have a bunch of locations around town, and they have Epi and Cobs beaten cold. In the general realm only Nino D'Aversa comes close. They have far better servive than the competition.   Try it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to Nova Era because I was craving for Portuguese custard tarts.  This easy to find location is on the ttc streetcar line.  I originally just wanted to go in for 1, but I ordered 6 and they threw in 2 extras which was really nice of them.  Their custard tarts are a little on the sweet side, but very delicious.  The textures was good.  There's a lot of seating available and they serve a lot of other desserts and baked goods.  The portuguese tart definitely satisfied my craving.  I also ordered a mocha, which was nice, but a little more than I'd pay for the satisfaction I received from the drink.  I think the tarts were a little over a $1.  I still recommend stopping by for a custard tart."}
{"text":"This place has amazing bread of all kinds - baguettes, rye bread sliced, olive bread, pada buns - it's all fresh and delicious. They also make yummy cheap sandwiches on said bread. The pastries are also excellent - I take all my guests there for the Portuguese tarts - heavenly and addictive. The only negative is the service - I used to think it's because I speak English and not Portuguese, but the service is actually bad for everyone. They have no sense of urgency or need to wait on people. Three people will be behind the counter with a huge line-up, but only one will come over to wait on people. No rush! I can wait 20 minutes for a loaf of bread! Eye roll. I feel lucky if I get waited on right away - like I won the lottery! That's how infrequently it happens."}
{"text":"I went to the first Nova Era location and later saw this one and decided to give it a try and see what things they offered. So I got the pudim, which is a custard-like dessert that I eat a lot in other places. The one from here was really bitter and I saw them drizzle a bunch of caramel from a bottle (I think that's why it was so bitter) and I got 2 bolinhos de bacalhau which is a fried cod cake. That one was even more bitter and mushy and we had to ask them to reheat it since it was cold. I don't know. I wanted to like this place but it just didn't feel like it was made there. Really disappointed."}
{"text":"I got two pastels de Belém, which is kind of a sweet eggy custard tart. They were a pretty nice snack. I'm used to eating them warmer, they were in the fridge, but it was still pretty good."}
{"text":"The tarts are pretty standard but the service is really bad...no one acknowledge you til you speak up...there is no line up set up which means people don't get served in order they come in ...long wait time"}
{"text":"Terrible Service all the time! They are notoroious for their terrible service. But if you must go, yes the coffee is good (if they manage to get your order right). They offer Soy milk now but don't bother, it is always old. The popular desserts like the natas are good and fresh but everything else, I wouldn't touch.  Honestly, they need to shape up especially since new competition has come around. They have a terrible reputation in the portuguese community which isn't a good sign. I would just go to Golden Wheat Bakery further east on College St. instead."}
{"text":"Close to Bar Isabel Nova Era is a lovely family bakery that's been serving this neighborhood for a long time. What's usually a busy place during the weekends and summer nights, it was surprisingly quiet.  The venue is clean, open layout and perfect view of the decadent desserts are centimeters away....quite the temptation eh? The service is great, the gentleman was courteous and talkative. From my prior visits, Nova Era is known for their Portuguese egg tarts. After consuming two tarts and a latte, I ordered half a dozen to take out lol.  Overall is a great venue whether it's after dinner, or taking a walk along college street."}
{"text":"Went for some afternoon snack. The Portuguese style custard tart was very good, though slightly on the sweeter side. Also had a coconut bun that was a bit dry, should've bought a drink to wash it down."}
{"text":"While waiting for an event to start (cuz god forbid anything starts at the time it was advertised to start!) came here to chill for a bit.  For some reason this place reminds me of a cafeteria.  They have bread loaves you can buy and then several different pastries and small bites to get. My friend got the fried cod and some fried shrimp cake thing.  She said it wasn't bad but assumed that perhaps they would heat it up before serving.  I had the chocolate croissant. Now..as far as croissants go...this one was friggin HUGE.  And covered with oodles and oodles of delightful powdered suger.  The inside was a delicious creamy chocolaty center.  With other places the centre is some hard piece of chocolate...usually milk chocolate, which i hate.    Service was quite nice, but since there was only one other couple in here I would expect it to be.  We ordered some stuff and got some tea and they brought it over to our table.  It was pretty cheap - my add a few pounds to my hips croissant was under $2!  The entire bill came up to about $10.  At Starbucks that will get you one cuppa joe!   I certainly wouldn't drive back there or highly recommend it.  But it worked in a pinch"}
{"text":"Just walked in there, placed my belongings on a empty table and proceeded to the take out counter, where two Portuguese/Brazilian woman were far to busy gossiping to acknowledge my existence, I got a look from both of them and they just continued chatting. Horrible customer service. Never again"}
{"text":"This review is from 2014.  Lol.. I am from Vancouver which has little to no Portuguese presence compared to Toronto. All I can say say is the Bifana I ordered was absolutely amazing. Fresh, tasty and filling. Good coffee and very nice ladies that were friendly.. I am coming back to TO for a day and my mission is to have a Bifana here  Space is also big and good for a group."}
{"text":"Located in the centre of Portugal town provided fresh bread, sandwich, coffee and desserts to   neighbourhood customers. Honestly, their desserts were too sweet and Portuguese tart was not delicious at all. But their bread were really fresh and aromatic. I can't help to eating it while the aroma of baked flour flying into my nose.  I found there was a stone oven inside but no pizzas on menus. Ohh, please. Don't let the oven lie idle, use it to made freshly baked pizza for us!!"}
{"text":"A good option if you're on the hunt for pastries late at night - as I usually am!  They're open late, while all other cafes/bakeries usually close early.  The Portuguese egg tarts here are excellent!  The other pastries are hit and miss, some are great, while I've found some others a bit stale sometimes.  The prices are great, you can get a whole box of pastries for under $10!"}
{"text":"Bustling place. Service is friendly. I had a very nice brownie and coffee. The coffee is really burnt, and I like that. Reminds me a lot of the Algarve."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for some cake after a late Friday night dinner, and randomly ended up at this place because it was open at 11pm (bonus).  This place as that really homey feeling and is completely unpretentious.   What we ate: -  The java was spectacular. (Coffee and cappuccino) - The strawberry shortcake felt like someone's grandmother just whipped it up in the back! - Almond tart was a yummy little bite. - Kaiser roll: Delicious - While there I picked up some cold cuts and cheese, can you image that the total bill for all of this was only 15$?  I will definitely be back for another cake fix!"}
{"text":"Everything I've ever eaten here is good: tarts, pastries, bread. I finally got around to trying some of the bread just recently and it's very tasty and flavourful. The corn bread and flax bread roll are my new favourites. I find the prices very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is more accurate. I usually just go here for their fresh baked bread since it's cheap and indeed very fresh-tasting. I've also had a few of their deli sandwiches and pastries which are all pretty good and reasonably priced.  However, the few times I've stayed for table service or needed assistance putting a box of pastries together... Well, I'm not Portuguese and feel like it definitely made a difference in the customer service I was receiving. It feels a little clique-y. I usually have to wait awhile before being acknowledged. They weren't outwardly rude, they just weren't that friendly either. But it's close to my house and the products are worth it so I continue to put up with the lukewarm service."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime patron of his bakery location (there are others in the city). We went on a Saturday afternoon so the place was so-so busy.   What stuck out for me was a 3 things.... 1. The the cake showcase was 1/2 empty?! Very little baked items at all. The rest of the items seemed \"warmed over\" meaning they looked far worse then they should have.  2. When we were served, the wait staff seemed annoyed by the fact they were serving us & the quality of her work reflected it. We had no cutlery or napkins or side plates for the several desserts we purchased! When we asked her for the items she practically rolled her eyes to get them! 3. The city bylaws say you must have a bathroom for both sexes...they had only the men's!! Not good!  I was very disappointed with this old rundown location. I WON'T be going there again."}
{"text":"I was going clubbing and tried this traditional portuguese bakery.   I felt like I was back in Brazil, where most bakeries are run by portuguese or italian families (I'm half italian, and my family used to have a bakery, obviously). Food is good, but not awesome. Service is AWFUL. I asked for  a traditional coffee-and-milk (supposedly, a latte), and was served a cup of coffee... with extra milk, charged. The cheese-and-ham sandwich was good, yep, but I've had better.   I was going to ask for some portuguese candy, but gave up due to bad service.   It's not a cheap place. And there's not even free wi-fi. It looks better than it really is. It's like a place to eat when you're hungry late night, because it's obviously clean.   I really don't know why they expect you to be served on the tables, if you asked over the counter the service would be faster."}
{"text":"the baked goods are uhhh good. good, not great.   the sandwiches they make are fresh, but they're not particularly good and they are crazy with the pricing.  $0.50 for every veggie you add.  $1.50 to add one tomato slice, one pickle and a tiny bit of shredded lettuce?  no.  not even considering that again.   such a disappointment.  the staff always seems kind of edgy. pretty much the only reason I'd go in again would be if they were the only place open in the area and I needed to get water.   such a disappointment  (went 3 different times to see if it ever got better in there. nope)  I'll go to Mickey D's before I try this place again."}
{"text":"Review is only for the Portuguese tart, which I think is the best in the city. Custardy with a crispy shell. Sweet but not overly... you should definitely try one. Would love to warm it up or try it fresh one time."}
{"text":"Went in to get a birthday cake and they had cakes that looked at least 2 weeks old each cake had cracks all over the cake. One crack is a indication it's old. A dozen cracks says it's really old. Definitely will never go back."}
{"text":"This review is for the natas at Nova Era.  For those that don't know, a nata is a Portuguese egg tart with a sweet creamy filling and flakey shell. You'll often see them in plastic trays of six at Portuguese markets. Avoid these prepackaged tarts at all costs; any time I've had them in this form they're stale and rubbery. Instead, do yourself a favour and trek over to Nova Era for a proper nata. By far the best natas I've had in Toronto.  The other baked goods and sandwiches on offer are good as well. The natas are the best though and I usually just stick with these."}
{"text":"Ordered two grilled sandwiches at 2:45. At 3 was still waiting and asked to cancel our order, wasn't expecting to wait that long. Was told it would only take 5 more min but usually takes longer for grilled sandwiches. Fifteen min later (Half an hour in total) was given our two sandwiches... they were not grilled."}
{"text":"Everything tastes good, but they have made my sandwich wrong 3 times in a row. Today I asked for Portuguese salami and they gave me prosciutto. It's too chewy and too salty.  Buy stuff a la carte. Don't trust them to make anything."}
{"text":"I love this bakery! Donuts are under a $1.50 and the chocolate glazed and sugar donuts are big and delicious. I like simple donuts, and when done right, they are heavenly. I was not a fan of their cream puffs and cinnamon buns though. They tasted stale."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place on and off for years!  I came in for a snack and got their shrimp pastry. It was so good.   I will go back and try more things and post a new review soon.  If you are in the area, stop by for their pastries, coffee and custard tarts!"}
{"text":"One thing: pastel de nata! I can't attest to their other offerings but the pastel de nata is pretty good. I remember coming here on my very first visit to Toronto and I happened by the same shop on my last visit so I decided to get some treats."}
{"text":"Decent location, usually pretty busy! The espresso is on point! That's typically what I order. They have a variety of baked goods, pastries, coffee, sandwiches, and loaves of bread or buns to purchase and take home. It's very affordable."}
{"text":"Seeing how I recently reviewed Venezia (my 5*) and Caldense (3*) for custard tarts, I figure rounding out the other popular spot would be a way to end my Little Portugal search.  I wish I could say great things but it's quite similar to Caldense.  Haphazard service, not a bad bakery... lots of seating but it's a bit on the darker side, but the tarts were really really sugary sweet without any good flavour.  I would say definitely a step down from Venezia but a touch above Caldense possibly.  When I first entered, I saw 3 young ladies behind the counter moving items around.  They all looked in my direction and as I stood idly by, not one said hi or verbally acknowledge me.  This was awkward.  A good minute goes by before this elderly gentleman stands by me.  Finally a few moments later, one of the young ladies come to the front cashier section.  As I was going to say 'hi', she abruptly goes into a loud Portuguese conversation with the gentleman.  I guess he's a regular.  He gets his items and he goes off his way.I finally get my turn and I get my 2 tarts placed in a bag.  For $2.65, I get 2 hefty tarts.  When I get home... I notice they have the nice caramelized topping and it seems the crust is flakier than Caldense and more similar to Venezia.  I take a sniff and I do smell vanilla... somewhat artificial but still a good smell.  When we bit into the tart, it definitely had a nice flakey crisp crust.  So far so good... as we started to enjoy beyond the crust, the sugar overload hit us pretty hard.  This tart was far more sugary one note compared to Venezia and Caldense.  It was hard to enjoy as it was too sweet and no flavour other than sugar.  I didn't really taste any good egg or vanilla.    Overall, I would still keep Venezia as my number one Portuguese custard tart.  This place has a great crust but the filling and service can definitely use some tweaking."}
{"text":"I'm getting hungry just thinking about this place.   As mentioned, they have pretty good natas (Portuguese egg tarts) but they also have these freakin' amazing cannoli (the tube shaped pastries filled with ricotta cream). So delicious.  They have a large assortment of pastries and some typical Portuguese breakfast snacks. I recently tried the shrimp patties and the cod fritters ($1.10 each) and both were OK.    They have free wifi and decent coffee too. Lots of seating, clean enough, staff is usually good."}
{"text":"The service I received at the store yesterday was absolutely appalling. When I approached the counter to pay for my bun the cashier tried to charge me for two. I told her I only had one, she tried to ring it in again, but still there were two on the screen. When I asked if she was still charging me for two, she dramatically rolled her eyes at me, and handed me the (admittedly correct) change. As I was walking away she said, \"You need sex\". I turned around, outraged, and asked to speak to the manager. She said I would have to come back and told me when. I told her I'd be there, and asked for her name which she tried not to give me (it's Anna). When I turned around and started to walk away again, she said, \"You need a dick\". 100% inappropriate, I cannot believe that she would say something like that to me. If you're going to be that rude and inappropriate, you shouldn't be working in customer service."}
{"text":"Nova Era Bakery O V E M B E R  Nova Era Bakery is the first stop of our November Food Crawl.  Nova Era seems to be popping up everywhere in the GTA, which I am not too surprise.   On this particular November Sunday this location was packed with people lining up for bread and pastries to go or just want to grab a quick coffee or like us just want to chill a bit where table services were offered.  The prices are affordable here as we enjoying our first meal of the day:  Cappuccino Med ($2.71) Egg Custard ($1.15) Carioca ($1.52) - which I found out is a weaker version of espresso which is having the hot water running through the ground coffee a second time  Services was quite fast... a little indifferent but the place was kind of busy with almost every table being occupied.  And aside from getting our Java fix, we even got a chance to pick up a lotto ticket when we were paying at the cash!  NEXT!!"}
{"text":"Nova Era Bakery is a great place to have a coffee and hang out with your friends!   Cappuccino Large ($3.15) and Custard Tart ($1.10) both were A-OK!   I placed my order with the nice cashier and then my drinks were delivered to my table by a friendly staff! I found the service was nice and warm!   Free Wifi! But you won't see tons of people here with their laptops! On this Sunday afternoon, I saw none..."}
{"text":"I love the nata here.  They're Portuguese custard tarts and they're delicious.  They're creamy, burnt and caramelized, with a flaky crust.  I don't think I've tried anything else.    Nova Era is conveniently located across the intersection from my favourite Ethiopian restaurant.  I like to come here before dinner (if I'm waiting for the line to die down at Nazareth) or after dinner, for a perfect little dessert.  5 stars for the tart."}
{"text":"I went to Nova Era (980 Bloor Street W) accidentally because I was in the neighborhood before The Monkey's Paw opened. I thought I would grab a little pastry somewhere, but this was so much better. I was kind of in a french-toast-and-giant-egg-platter trance from my first two breakfasts when I saw it because, while I was walking to it, I almost ran into a police horse. Seriously.  Nova Era had an excellent bread selection, good coffee (I had a cappuccino that was perfect) and picture-perfect pastries. I had a chocolate donut, which was impressive (both because I ate it after already eating so much and because it was so good). Honestly, the donut was SO good that I got SO excited about eating the donut that I forgot to take a picture. What?!? Eating something without taking a picture. That is crazy. Did I mention I love breakfast? I love breakfast to distraction.  The morning I was there, I was (by far) the youngest person in the place. There was a substantial elderly population that looked like they came there every day; they all seemed to know each other and were having loud, friendly conversations across many tables.  At the counter, they sell lottery tickets, which is an interesting process in Canada. The seller brings out a tray of tickets to choose from, like a dessert try in a restaurant. Sometimes the counter makes a chime noise when the customer selects a ticket. While eating my third breakfast of the day at Nova Era, I was mesmerized by the chime sound and felt like I had won the lottery."}
{"text":"Food is terrible, service is worse, wouldn't waste my time or money on the dump. When you order they mutter under their breath, in another language too low to catch, so why would you give them a dime?"}
{"text":"strictly one one Portuguese tart (in comparison to the one across the street from this place)  - great appearance, toasted top ,  - thick rim of pastry around the custard.  - crunchy chewy thick pastry around the body of the custard - slightly sweeter than the one across the street. - taste is more eggy and texture is curdle-y like.  (more stars just for the tickness of the nice chewy pastry part and very toasted top"}
{"text":"One of the greatest pleasures of living in downtown Toronto west is the Portuguese bakeries. Incredibly reasonably priced sandwiches, pastries, custards and meaty extras make my world go around, and Nova Era delivers all of this goodness.   My go to lunch here (and a lot of bakeries in my hood) is the tosta mista. If you aren't familiar, it's a big soft roll with ham and cheese that they press down to a grilled panini-like thing, and it's crunchy, gooey and always satisfying. Pair it with one of their daily homemade soups? Done.   They also make entire cakes daily, and sell slices on the cheap, if you have a sweet tooth."}
