{"text":"Amazing food.  Noodles were perfect level of spice.  May have over indulged in the dumplings.  Top notch.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After seeing the write ups on Charlotte Observer and Creative Loafing we had to try this place out. Dumplings were amazing and cannot wait to come back and try out the noodles!"}
{"text":"I ran into the dumpling lady at her booth during the pig picking in plaza midwood. At the time I gushed over not just the dumpling, but the sauce. She was kind enough to send me home with half a cup full, which I couldn't refrain from smelling on the ride home. The next day, I marinated a filet in her amazing sauce and I'm still riding the adrenaline high. Might be the best sauce I've ever had, even in my travels to Asia. Thanks for being awesome and making awesome food."}
{"text":"It deserves a five star! Especially in Charlotte, where you can hardly find any authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Awesome dumplings.  Fun place to grab some cheap eats in NoDa. Grab a seat outside, or just wander a little while they whip it up."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this local favorite mobile this Friday @ Camp North End. Yep. It's gooood!!  Got the Spicy Beef Noddles & Sweet Pork Belly Dumplings. The noodles were flavorful, fresh, & Spicy!  TIP: Heed her \"heat rating chart\". This dish is 5/5. Hot!  The dumplings were definitely my favorite!  Delicious! The reviews about the AMAZING sauce are true. You will find some way to save/use it. Also spicy, but you can't stop eating them. That's why people complain that there are \"only\" ten dumplings. Any other place, ten would be plenty. Not these. You end up just devouring them!!  And people early to event confirmed that everything is fresh & handmade. They watched them make everything. Wow! The only reason for the 4 stars is because I agree with my fellow Yelpers that SOMETHING should be provided with the dinner service. At lunch she serves rice with your meal. Dinner should also come with a side to help cut the heat and utilize that phenomenal, left over sauce. At least offer something on menu to add. But at $9, we should already get a little scoop of rice."}
{"text":"Amazing! Been a long time since I had dumplings that good. We had the chicken and mushroom dumplings and the pork and chive dumplings. Spiced just right, tender dumplings, and just the right amount of filling. Can't wait to try the sweet pork belly next time."}
{"text":"We were lucky to find this food truck at Atherton mill one Saturday morning. Really good noodle consistency. I would highly recommend the Zha Jiang noodle and their dumplings."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try the Dumpling Lady for a while now and happened to catch them by coincidence at an event at Abari. So glad I decided to grab something!!  We ordered the spicy beef noodles and the pork and chive dumplings. Both were fantastic! The dumplings were made perfectly and so flavorful. That sauce. The spicy noodles were definitely spicy but it was that, make you wanna come back for more, kind of spice.   I really appreciate them giving us a pager to know when our food is ready, opposed to having to listen for your name.  I can't wait to try other options!"}
{"text":"Hey! I finally saw and caught the unicorn!  I tried to time my visit st the company store where I can catch the farmers market and the dumpling lady at the same.damn.time. But, I missed the farmers market. But this food right here....cue Oprah...DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!  I got the spicy beef noodles and chicken and shrimp dumplings. Everything people have said is true. I loved it all. I didn't share and I split it for 2 different lunches.   Can't wait to go back. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend The Dumpling Lady - ordered the shrimp and chicken combo and the pork and chives when I saw her at the Atherton Market on Saturday. Easy pickup that Wednesday at NoDa's Company Store, but she offered free delivery. $12 per dozen includes a tangy soy sauce for dipping. Preparation is super easy - drop them in boiling water; when they float they are ready. Served them with white rice and saut√©ed vegetables and my dinner companions were thrilled! I will order them again."}
{"text":"It was okay. Not bad. Not great. The dumplings were tiny. The noodles were not very memorable.  Overall a so so experience. I may try it again at some point but probably not."}
{"text":"I love the dumplings and noodles. There is a reason this foodtruck always has a line. I am giving 5 stars but would do 4.5 if I could, only because of the over abundance of garlic after- taste from their sauce. If you are a vampire, stay away! I have tried almost everything and it is all good. Ask for the extra spicy sauce on the side- it has some serious kick!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to maybe find a good dumpling place...  While ordering i asked about something they refer to as their ultimate spicy sauce. They didnt have any that day but they said that they had regular spicy sauce but i was only given regular dumpling sauce.   The order taker was a bit rushed and not very helpful.   Pork and Chive Dumpling: The wrapper had a gummy texture and doughy taste. The sauce was typically good but with out any spice. The filling seems okay but was overpowered by the taste of the wrapper.  Sweet Pork Belly Dumpling: The won ton wrapper used was much better. The filling had much more flavor and meatiness to it. The sauce was very powerful, strong garlic flavor (love garlic) but was pretty salty (could use a little sugar or chili oil to balance).   Steam Bao: The dough was dense and firm when not light and tender the bun ionly detracted from the sandwich. The Pork Belly was very flavorful but was cooked until firm and dry. Pork belly is at it's best with fully cooked yet tender, juicy and succulent. It should literally fall apart and melt in the mouth."}
{"text":"Read about the dumpling lady long before I moved to Charlotte. Finally made the trip up to South End to find her parked outside a beer garden. Ordered three different types: pork belly, shrimp/chicken and crab/chicken. I'm not particularly fond of super hot spicy food so I told her to keep the spices mild. Ho Lee Sheet ! Even the mild dumplings tore me a new one! Had to drink a quart of milk just to neutralize the flaming cauldron inside my stomach. Lovely lady and all but Jeezus!"}
{"text":"I finally caught up with the dumpling lady...and it was totally worth it!   I ordered he spicy beef noodles and the shrimp and chicken dumplings.   The spicy beef noodles were awesome! They were definitely spicy. And the flavors in this dish were everything and more. The chicken and shrimp dumplings were very tasty too. I am looking forward to trying the other options too...because they all sound so delicious.   If you're lucky enough to catch this truck...I absolutely recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Food is great really enjoy the pork belly bao. Love the fact you can buy them frozen I like to deep fry mine at home it goes well with her Sichuan sauce"}
{"text":"This truck needs no review from me. It's a staple of Charlotte and always delivers! Yummy Yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"I dabble in making my own dumplings which I must say are pretty outstanding. I thought these were good but they didnt WOW me... just average. A little on the pricey side but if your looking to just relax with some finger food and an adult beverage than give it a try."}
{"text":"Believe the hype, the dumpling lady has the best dumplings definitely in charlotte maybe in the world. The cult following is completely justified I just wish she had a actual restaurant because I had it for lunch today and I am already craving it again. Seriously one of the top 5 best food trucks in charlotte. Amazing how full you get from one plate. I got the pork and chive, husband got the pork belly and both were phenomenal can't wait to try noodles next time!"}
{"text":"If you're in the Charlotte Area and looking for something good to eat.. Look no more! Tasty authentic food which will fill up any cravings. We had the Dan Dan noodles as shown in the photo and we got two orders of dumplings one spicy pork belly and the other chicken and mushroom, both fantastic! Also great customer service! We had called them to find out where they were located tonight and they returned the call shortly after, we'll definitely be back! Thanks Dumpling Family"}
{"text":"Now this place is a restaurant quality food truck. Something different, yet fast, yet yummy! I'm big on flavor and this food from here is full of it. I had the pleasure of ordering the spicy beef noodles the first time I can here. It was so delicious! Once you mix it up real good in the oil, it was perfect. I wish the noodles could hold the oil/sauce better because some bites just tasted like plain noodles. I also had some yummy shrimp dumplings! All of this is guaranteed to have your whole outfit filled with red spots and you wouldn't even notice it so eat with experience caution. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"If you haven't had a chance to try these dumplings, please do yourself a favor and join me  as I follow them all over the qc to get my fix.  They have many flavors of dumplings(chicken, shrimp, veggie, etc.)  but the sweet pork belly dumplings are exceptional!  Tender flavorful dumplings with a spicy chili sauce.  They are melt in your mouth good!  They also offer a few noodle dishes as well and they are equally great, but my fav will forever be the sweet pork belly!  Don't take my word for it, check them out!"}
{"text":"These dumplings are seriously delicious. But if you have lower spice tolerance, come prepared to battle your body as you embark on this culinary journey (worth it though). I really enjoyed the pork and chive dumplings, but if you are not into those strong \"traditional\" Chinese flavors, the chicken & shrimp and pork belly dumplings are good as well.  They have an awesome lunch combo that lets you order a smaller portion of noodles + 6 dumplings for $12, which is a nice deal if you want to try multiple things. I died a little on the inside from the spiciness of the Dan Dan Noodles, but again...it was worth the pain."}
{"text":"I have been stalking this food truck for quite some time. Like other Yelpers mentioned, she is hard to track down at time. Not much notice on her IG page.. and her opening at certain time is not always accurate! However, her dumplings are yummy.. They're spicy but not spicy enough that they can kill you even tho it look like it., I have a chance to try the crab and chicken dumplings today. Wanted to try the ramen and pork buns but unfortunately it was sold out by time they took my order.  Re: the crab and chicken dumplings. The texture (wrappers) hold up to the sauce very well. All combine nicely.. does have a kick to it. I did have a peek at the beef ramen and the gentleman told me it's spicy.. I sure wish she would have a star by it to say it's spicy or something. But overall my craving have been satisfied. If I can track her down again. I would love to try her pork buns and ramen!"}
{"text":"May be the best dumplings I have ever had. Had the shrimp & chicken dumplings and then went back for the pork belly dumplings. Very quick service.  Will definitely be returning every other Monday in the Ballantyne Corporate Park."}
{"text":"Best dumplings I've ever had. O..M..G. That was a culinary showstopper. So far I've tried the Sweet Pork Belly and the Pork and Chives. Unlike some other dumpling spots I've tried recently, the filling has a wonderful texture and full of meat. The dumpling itself is supple, and has a nice bite to it. Not too doughy or mushy, just the right amount of give to it.  But here is what really sets them apart: THE SAUCE. You'll see a lot of Yelpers here just ranting and raving about the sauce, and I promise you it's not over-hyped. I can't believe that with 26 years on this earth, I haven't found anything even remotely as dynamic and harmonizing as that sauce. Lots of ginger flavor with punches of garlic, chili oil, sesame, countless other notes. Forget multi-dimensional, it's omni-dimensional!  They've got a good system for queuing as well. They are the first truck I've seen that gives you a pager with your order. Really neat and frees up the order taker from having to keep track of a dozen names at a time! Their locations and schedule is regularly maintained on Facebook and Instagram as well.  ..So, why 3 stars? One word: Service. I've been there a grand total of TWO times so far and both this week, yeah the food was that good. I hate to say it but both times they just weren't... friendly... at all. The first time, the person taking the order seemed very rushed and impatient. The lady behind me was asking about the peanuts in the sauce and no one even acted like they wanted to answer the question.  I thought maybe they were having a bad day, or someone had called out who was supposed to take some of the workload. Well today, I got a lot of the same in a much less busy environment than the previous visit. Walked up to the truck with no one in line and I simply asked if they would split the dumpling order of 10 between two flavors. The order taker looked at the other girl cooking the food and before she could even finish the question she just shook her head no without even looking at me or the girl. Idk, it just seems like a little bit of service could go a long way. Don't change the way you do things, but at least offer an apology or a reason, maybe look at the customers that are buying your (relatively speaking) expensive dumplings.  Imagine a military cadet fresh out of The Citadel who graduated with honors, top of his/her class, best there is. Then, throw 'em out in the war with no battlefield experience whatsoever. That's where these guys are now. They have the technical aptitude and culinary mastery to make the best product in their class, but they need to polish the hospitality basics or risk alienating their core customers. I mean really, I have no problem paying $9 for dumplings this good, but at least smile? =D"}
{"text":"Spotted The Dumpling Lady parked on Fairview by the Panera and had to bust a U-turn to see what the hype was all about... and after trying the dumplings for myself I must say the hype is real! The dumplings are tender, soft and full of flavor! The dumplings are bite-sized and they just melt in your mouth. The sauce is EVERYTHING with the chili oil and scallions on top! The best part is the sweet ladies who run the truck gave me an extra portion of vegetarian noodles because my husband and I were sharing a combo but we couldn't compromised between what meat item to get being that I'm a vegetarian! The portions and flavors are worth the price and drive to search for this food truck! Yum yum! Extra stars for the awesome customer service and helpful suggestions!"}
{"text":"Super over priced, maybe because I'm Chinese and I know how much dumplings usually cost? The dumplings wasn't even that good, only the sauce was. So no I will not go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Definitely worth standing in line at 11am in the blistering Charlotte heat! The Dumpling Lady is a food truck that will sit in front of One Wells Fargo on Friday at 11-2 (right outside the entrance, you can't possibly miss it), but definitely get there early -- I arrived at 10:45 and there was already a line of people waiting! However, once they open they move fast! It helps that they have plenty of menus that are passed down the line, so by the time you're at the window, you're not going \"ummmmmm I don't know what I want\".  The $12 lunch special is filling and a good bang for your buck -- you get 1 noodle and 6 dumplings. (You normally get 9 dumplings in a dumpling order, but I don't think I could eat 9 dumplings and the noodles in one go.) I chose the Dan Dan noodles -- a Sichuan specialty -- and some sweet pork belly dumplings. The Dan Dan noodles were perfectly spicy -- definitely mix the noodles, beef, and sauce before you partake or you won't get the full experience! The sweet pork belly dumplings were surprising as I expected a traditional potsticker style dumpling instead of the shumai style dumplings that you would get at a dim sum restaurant, but the wrappers were done well (not thick and not soggy) and the filling had a light five-spice taste to them, which complemented the sauce. And definitely get the sauce on top -- it's spicy and complements the food well.  The one thing that I would warn about is that unlike some food trucks, this one doesn't sell beverages (or at least, I didn't see any offered on the menu). But I'll definitely be back the next time the truck rolls around in Uptown to get my dumpling and noodle fix!"}
{"text":"Go to their facebook or instagram to find their locations and hours for the week! They tend to be open for lunch on the weekdays and dinner on the weekends. Noodles are $9 a bowl and dumplings are $10 for 11 dumplings. This is pretty steep but I guess their the only business of their kind in the area and they are a food truck so the higher price is expected. I got the pork and chives dumplings and the zhajiang mian, or black bean sauce noodles.   The dumplings were good and the sauce it came with was great, I added a lot of black vinegar though lol, but it didn't seem to have a big difference from the store bought dumpling I get. The noodles were similar, I think they are egg noodles, and had some strips of cucumber and other veggies. This was definitely not black bean noodles lol the sauce was completely different. I don't know if they just got the sauce wrong or if they're passing off these as black bean noodles.   We got a to go order and they were kind enough to pack the food and sauces separately for us which was great. I would say by and far the sauces are the highlight of their dishes. It is traditional chinese hot chili oil with some garlic, ginger, and spring onions. This is definitely home made and fresh and tastes amazing!   I'm not as sure about the actual food part, they are very similar to what I can get from stores but they were still very good in flavor. The prices are steep but I believe they have cheaper offerings during lunch. Definitely worth a try for some very authentic, for the area, chinese food."}
{"text":"I was meeting a couple of friends at a nearby brewery and this was the food truck they had here. I wanted the sweet pork dumplings, but unfortunately they did not have any left (but failed to erase it off the board...).  I went with the pork and chive instead.  The flavor was very good, but there was a little kick to it that I was not expecting. They are smaller dumplings than other places as well. I think they come with 10 dumplings, which was a decent size - although I could have eaten a few more or even split another with a friend. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and I look forward to being able to try the sweet pork dumplings next time."}
{"text":"The dumpling lady consistently delivers! Honestly, I cannot remember having had better dumplings in the past few years.  I used to be all about the shrimp & chicken but I have found a new favorite in the chicken & mushroom. They are something that I can find myself eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  What sends them over the top is the homemade chili oil that coats them. I have even seen people drink that sauce directly from the pan!  The normal menu consists of multiple flavors of dumplings and noodles. For the lunch combo, you can combine one flavor of dumpling and one type of noodle for $12. Normally, one portion of dumplings go for $9. Just note the lunch combo portion of dumplings is reduced to six from the usual nine, however, the noodle portion remains the same.  Thanks to the ever-growing popularity of the dumpling lady, I see the truck popping up at more and more places. Most consistently, the truck can be found at Noda Company Store....and, thankfully, at my business park every other week! The most surprising fact I read about the actual Dumpling Lady is that she recently moved from China to Charlotte a little over three years ago.  The truck has Instagram, facebook, and twitter pages so you can keep up with the schedule and menu. Once you find this truck, you'll soon learn why there are so many fans!"}
{"text":"I love dumplings and it's hard to find great dumplings.These really are some of the best dumplings in town, but the sauce is what brings it to the next level. However, if you don't like spicy food, you may want to ask for them without sauce. It's a chili oil with hints of ginger and scallions. I ordered the pork and chive, but honestly this flavor blends in with the sauce. The dumplings aren't too doughy and have a good bit of meat.   There's a lunch combo which combines your choice of noodles and six dumplings for $12. For my noodle selection, I tried the spicy beef because I love spicy food. I've had the burning noodles here before, but to me the spicy beef had more heat. The noodles themselves have a great texture. Again the sauce is great and very similar to the dumpling sauce, but very spicy. I took in a couple of peppercorns which had my mouth on fire. I like the freshness of the carrots and cucumber, but it was missing the papaya that was listed on the menu description.  The flavors overall played well together.   My only critique is the time it takes to get food. I caught them at Well's Fargo uptown during peak lunchtime at noon. I waited about 25 minutes to order and then another 10 minutes for food. I like that they had pagers so you don't have to wait for your name to be shouted.  It was a nice day and I like that this location has plenty of tables on the plaza. I barely had time to eat on my hour lunch break since it's about a ten minute walk back to my office.   You're not going to find food this authentic in any area take out restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd buy liters of the dipping sauce if I could-- so good I could eat it on anything! Dumplings are super fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Got some pork dumplings from here while at Sycamore Brewing. My order had 10 fairly small dumplings that were covered in a chili oil. The pork was flavorful but the dumplings overall were ok- I wish the dumpling order came with some sort of side. I would go back and try out their noodle dishes if I came across the truck again but wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try The Dumpling Lady's FT for awhile, so glad she paid a visit to Whitehall today. Im not sure what the sauce mixture is for the dumplings but it is divine!!! One Yelper mentioned turning up the container to drink it. That's gonna be me in a minute. LoL! Spicy beef Ramen is on point too. So nice to have fresh noodles compared to the packaged stuff. I could really tell the difference. I am a fan and can't wait to eat from here again."}
{"text":"Spicy food which is actually spicy and hot !!!! Loved the dumplings and the spicy beef noodles. Highly recommended.   Try the pork belly dumplings !!!"}
{"text":"I love dumpling and noodle dishes so I was so excited to try this! The flavor was amazing, it was honestly some of the best dumplings I have had in a very long time. The reason for my 4 Star review is, the dishes are about $9 a pop and you really don't get a lot. I had to order two dishes to get full. Other than that, great!"}
{"text":"Good spices. The pre-packaged ones get dried out because the top of the dumplings are exposed to air."}
{"text":"Amazing soup dumplings! This truck has quality food. We ate it outside of resident culture what a treat!! I wish the dumpling lady would park outside my house on the reg!! Tasty as hell!!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about the Dumpling Lady and finally bumped into her one night after dinner.  I have been searching and finally found her, so I had to grab some to go.     Let me apologize in advance on the picture that I attached as this was the following day.  As I said earlier, we had just finished a big dinner right before we stumbled upon her so I didn't get to enjoy till the next day.    We tried the Seeet Pork Belly dumplings and the taste was AWESOME!!!!   Had a good amount of spice to it for that extra kick.  Dumplings had good consistency which is something that you don't always find.    The next time that I find her, I will eat them on the spot and not wait.  Go forth and conquer."}
{"text":"Today will be the 2nd time this foodtruck did not show up where it was supposed to be. We went to Lennyboy brewing to watch some football and finally try some dumplings and noodles. We arrives at 115pm and the foodtruck was supposed to be there at noon and she was not. Went inside and asked the employees where the truck was and they said she called and said she was on the way an hour ago. Lennyboy doesn't serve food so we gad no other choice but to leave.  This is the 2nd time she didn't show up at a certain location. Im done trying to try this truck out."}
{"text":"These dumplings were so good they inspired me to learn to make my own. I couldn't imagine the wait during the lunch rush, but I was there early enough for there to only be 2 people ahead of me. I love dumplings."}
{"text":"Greatest experience I've every put in my mouth. The dumplings are so favorful. I prefer the sweet pork belly. Chicken and beef bowls are ok. The noodle bowls are likewise amazing. I think these gals just need to stick with noodles and dumplings."}
{"text":"I can't say anything bad about this place. The dumplings are delicious and they have combo plates that are really good too. Prices are reasonable and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Love love love her dumplings and the spicy noodles have a ton of great flavor! We always look out for her at the Company Store in NODA... grab a beer and enjoy some dumplings!"}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings and great noodles! I lived abroad in Asia and their dumplings are the real deal. I ordered the chicken and shrimp dumplings and burning noodles. Very friendly staff and delicious food! Please open a brick and mortar restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dumplings has good flavors. I do not find much difference between pork and chive from pork belly. The sauce is good with lots of ginger taste. I Did not try the noodles, my friend rate it okay. Honestly not worth trying to hunt it down. There is a dumping stand in the G mart grocery store on independence. Their dumplings are bigger in size, but sauce is not as good as dumpling lady.  I gave it a 3 d/t difficulty to find and they were not at noda at 430. I end up eat somewhere else. Saw they were open  1.5 hours later, so decided to get some to go. In Noda they are located behind Noda Company Store. Easier to see Smelly Cat coffee store, it right behind it. There are sitting area, which is nice.   There is a parking lot next to it. 5 dollars but no attendance, likely cash .  It's also pricey , 9 dollar for 8-10 small dumplings."}
{"text":"I swear, I will find a way to convince Yelp to add a 6th star if the Dumpling Lady starts bottling and selling that magical sauce! Seriously, y'all. It is so good. The last time we had dumplings, we went to Yummi and bought a banh mi just to soak up the extra sauce. The time before that, we put the lid back on the tin and brought the extra sauce home with us. It's an actual crime to just throw away the sauce you can't manage to sop up with dumplings.   Oh, yeah. The dumplings are to die for, too. ;) Super flavorful and always stuffed with tasty, fresh fillings like chicken and mushrooms, pork and chives, etc. And, don't even get me started on the buns. A great option to soak up the extra sauce as well, btw.   If you're lucky enough to be at the same place at the same time as the Dumpling Lady, pay her a visit!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was disappointed in the hype of the Dumpling Lady - I was excited to come and try this after reading articles about this new food truck. We ordered the pork & chives dumplings, the pork belly  zha jiang noodles, the pork belly steamed bun, and the chicken & mushroom dumplings. While none of the food tasted bad, it wasn't the best either. The dumpling skin was the right thickness but the actual flavors were a bit bland compared to your traditional homemade dumplings - the sauce helped a lot. The pork belly bun was a bit misleading as it's not the typical pork belly you'd think of - more like minced pork bun, not the fatty slice that people are used to. The zha jiang noodles were probably my favorite of the night - just the right heat and flavor. One of our friends ordered the spicy beef noodles and beware of the Szechuan spice! It can kill your tastebuds if you're not used to it!"}
{"text":"Soooo good! Her food is authentic and unique so amazing every time! I do hope she'll be able to use recyclable or compostable containers in the future because I plan to eat her food A LOT and I feel bad about all the waste it creates. Other than that, you have it try her dumplings, noodles and bao!"}
{"text":"I wish I had taken some pictures to accompany this review. We had the burning noodles and two types of dumplings (pork and chive and chicken and shrimp). By far, the best dumplings and noodles I've ever had the joy of consuming....so good that we bought an order to go as we left!  I'll definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"I decided to try ordering from their food truck today.  They had a lunch special for $12 which was noodles and 6 dumplings.  The food smelled wonderful.  The dumpling sauce was a bit spicy to me. Fortunately I like spicy food.  Unfortunately there was cilantro in it and I'm very sensitive to cilantro.  Even a little piece will ruin the entire dish for me so I was disappointed with that.  I'm not sure if it's possible to get it without the cilantro but it may be worth asking because it was otherwise delicious.  For the noodles they were out of everything but the Dan Dan noodles.  When I took a bite they were good but a bit dry.  I then realized the sauce was on the bottom of the dish so I mixed everything up.  Once I did that the noodles were delicious but a bit too spicy even for me, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately the rest of the day my stomach has been very upset (it still is even 12 hours later).  I think it may have been all the spice or perhaps an oil they used that bothered my stomach. I'm not sure I'd try it again but if I ever do, I'd definitely order something different."}
{"text":"I ordered the Burning Noodles, and they said it was really spicy, however I have a big tolerance so it wasn't spicy for me at all. However it was delicious. Also my friends ordered the pork and chives dumpling, and they said it was AM-AZ-ING!!! I wasn't able to order the veggie dumplings cause they ran out.  Definitely need to go back for veggie dumplings."}
{"text":"Dumpling Lady is easily one of my favorite food trucks in Charlotte! Get the pork belly dumplings, they are outstanding!"}
{"text":"First lunch-break food truck of spring is akin to the vultures returning to Capistrano. Yea birds!! They pull in on the other side of the offices which means an embarrassingly short drive or a really long walk so I usually opt to dine in and save some nickels but it was so springy and dumplingy out yesterday that I had to make the trek. A happy face helped me with my lunch selections and we exchanged a small pile of cash for a page-o-matic, a few minutes later food calls and then I'm heading back to the lab with a sac-o'-goodies: Dan Dan Noodles plus Pork n Chive dumplings we're oh so good and lived up to the hype: pop the top and jam a fork under the noodles, stir it roundy round and let the flavors mingle while sharing some dumpley goodness. Yea chili sauce!! Soft but firm noodles are so good and so full-feeling; shredded meats, nuts, and green bits hanging out in hot sauce making the most of our time together. ...if I had a rice maker for at work this would be perfect."}
{"text":"We had heard a good bit about The Dumpling Lady. To be fair, we are not exactly fans of the food truck scene overall, but we are fans of Asian food in general, and dumplings specifically, and had an afternoon to spare, so thought we would give it a go.  The first thing, as with many food trucks, is figuring out where they are on any given day.  With The Dumpling Lady, I searched on Google and found their web page. Right there on the home page, I found a schedule. It mentions their normal schedule for each day. Unfortunately it does not include Sunday, and we were out on a Sunday.  However, there is a mention of both Instagram and a locations tab. Since I was already on the web site, I checked the locations tab. No luck there, still no Sunday. But it does mention Facebook as well as Instagram. I checked Facebook quickly, and it looked like most of those were actually coming from Instagram, so off I went.  There I found the standard pictures of food, as well as a number of scheduley-looking posts (looking sort of like a menu). Seeming like a good place to start, I pulled up the most recent one at the time. This is important.  On that day, it was this one: https://www.instagram.com/p/BjBGvytHLdi/  You can also see a copy here: https://ibb.co/crj1Ky  And I have uploaded a copy to the business photos here on Yelp, and to the last two I have added an arrow to show the time at Triple C. Why be so detailed? Simply to point out - mostly to myself, perhaps - that I'm not completely insane.  Next up: The waiting (perhaps abnormal).  After running some errands in the morning, we arrive at Triple C at a bit after 2pm. At the time, the truck was there, with a single person in the back, however it was not open for orders. After checking to verify that they are not open yet, and being told it will be \"about fifteen minutes\" - which would be around 2:30 - we head inside and get a drink and proceed to wait.  Since it's a nice day - not yet that hot - we sit and observe. We notice that there is indeed a single individual inside, working to (do stuff). There are a bunch of folks, and a few dogs, hanging out enjoying the day. While we are not what you would call regulars, it does seem that more than a few of them are waiting on the food, since only a small percentage are actually drinking - and many are watching the truck.  It is during this time that we find out at least one couple has been there since 12:30 (only because they mention it both now and after placing their order at the window a short while later). Another person nods their agreement that they have been waiting a while, but does not seem to have been there as long.  Sometime between our arrival and 2:30ish, another person arrives and begins helping in the truck. Not sure if this person was there before and returned (maybe went to get things and came back) or only now arrived for the first time. At least it seems that we're getting closer. Around the promised time - in person, not online - the window opens. But orders take a few minutes more because the menus have to be written on the chalkboards.  And now: The ordering (probably fairly standard, except a small issue).  Eventually, we get to the point where we can order. There are menus on the chalkboards. There are printed menus that you can read when you get to the front that explain items in detail. The staff can explain in even more detail if needed. This actually goes fairly well, and the line moves quickly.  This is where we hear (again) that one couple has been there for a couple of hours. Not sure why, unless they just really, really, like dumplings, but that's their choice. I don't wait a couple of hours for much of anything.  Regardless, after ordering, you pay on a Square-type of terminal, and normally would get a pager-type device to notify you when your order is ready. This is similar to if you're in a restaurant waiting for your table to be ready. Only this isn't working. So they take your name instead.  The verdict?  If it was all about the pork dumplings, you'd be looking at four stars all day long. Perhaps something strange like a 3.8, but I'd round up without batting an eye. Unfortunately the chicken dumplings and the beef noodles add little, and in fact likely take away from the experience.  Enough to drop all the way to a three star? Maybe, maybe not.  Throw in the waiting and the issues with the scheduling and it's a different story.  On a side note, I did mention originally about getting up at the \"crack of noon\". Perhaps that rubbed them the wrong way. I make that comment - and I am sure, others - off the top of my head a lot and maybe it rubs a lot of folks the wrong way. If it did, I apologize.  One more note. Qian sent me a message to say this was the first week they changed their schedule from 12:30 to 2:00pm. Unfortunately they forgot to post this anywhere. The apology is certainly welcome. But if you depend on an online source to get an update, and there is no update? That sorta stinks."}

{"text":"I give this a high 2, almost a 3 due to customer service.    Disclaimer: I am a self-appointed dumpling snob. I'm from Taiwan.    Moving onto the review..   My boyfriend told me about this food truck that comes to NoDa on Saturday afternoons so I was extremely excited - especially with the limited amount of authentic Asian food in Charlotte. Finally, the day arrived and I couldn't wait. I should also add that my boyfriend and I have been living a more vegetarian lifestyle but Asian food is usually pretty solid to that particular diet.. Lots of creative ways to eat veggies.   Unfortunately, out of their many options on their menu... Only 2 were Vegetarian friendly. One noodle dish and one dumpling option. That alone was very disappointing. There could easily be more mushroom based dumplings, for example.   Ordered a potatoe-veggie dumpling and I quickly realized that these are pre-made (understandably so), pre-frozen and tasted ...amateur. Skin of the dumpling was rough, wasn't reheated all the way through, very chewy and definitely NOT \"fresh\" tasting. The inside of the dumpling looked like mush. Very bland. The only saving grace was the sauce that the dumplings that are doused in. Now that - was probably the only good thing about my experience. (Mind you, we had 3 separate containers of these dumplings) I would not pay $9 again for cold, basic dumplings. Sorry :(  The noodles were ordered hot and arrived very cold. She said they were the last ones and could not be re-heated. I wish I had known that initially when we picked up the food but I digress. She was very nice though and gave us free dumplings. The noodles are something I would order again but only if they were piping hot.   ProTip:  √ó follow her on Instagram: @thedumplinglady for weekly updates on her locations and times √ó if you are intent on trying her, I could recommend visiting her at the beginning of her shift instead of the later. Dumpling options start to dwindle and you might have better luck than I with fresher ones."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars, I'm deducting one star because they're hard to find! This week they posted on Instagram where they would be and I think that's great. Tell me where you are so I can give you my money, please.   We had the spicy beef noodles which were good and spicy - heads up they are served cold. We also ordered a 10 piece pork and chive dumpling. So soft and flavorful; they sit in a pool of dipping sauce. Each item was $9. I would get the dumplings again - they hit the spot!"}
{"text":"This is as legit as it gets. Homemade dumplings for prices you can't beat. Decent portions, too. I got an order and had a few bites for leftovers after the brewery!! Staff is wonderful too. You can tell they work their butts off and really care about the quality of their product."}
{"text":"Dumpling Lady, I love you.  These dumplings are legit. Qian learned all the recipes and tricks from her grandmother. Every dumpling is made by hand. Seriously, right now they're making around 2,000 a day.   She gets all her proteins from local farms. Dumpling wise, I really don't think you can go wrong with any of them. They are all delicious. The sauce is stupid good. During week day lunches, they usually have a noodle and dumpling combo option. Even when there's not a combo option on the weekends, I'll still order both dumplings and noodles. Hey, sometimes you need two lunches (who am I kidding, I always end up eating all of it the minute I get home).  The best way to find them is on their Instagram or Facebook. They post the schedule each week. The Dumpling Lady is also available to cater private events, parties, and corporate lunches."}
{"text":"The best dumplings in Charlotte , the Chinese crepe is just amaazinggggggg. Don't miss on the veggie dumplings"}
{"text":"Our first visit to this truck. Let me say the dumplings are legit! Having lived in Singapore fir three years we long for good dumplings. We will stalk this truck in the future. A bit spicy fir some but it is just the right amount for me.  YUM"}
{"text":"Best Food Truck in Charlotte!  All the dumplings are awesome but the burning noodles are definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I LOVE The Dumpling Lady!  I love, love, love it.  The dumplings here are absolutely amazing.  I visited them in NoDa one Saturday.  It wasn't too busy.  You place your order and then they will call you back for your food like most food trucks.    I can't wait to try other options and can't wait to have more of the dumplings.  When you see The Dumpling Lady, you must try at least something.  I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Eight weeks on the road without some real Chinese food makes Kai kind of desperate. Desperate Kai eats gas station dumplings in South Carolina and gas station dumplings are not a good thing.   So I get back to CLT and I'm craving ramen and wait... What. Is. This?? Sichuan beef noodles? I'm out the door and headed for NoDa. Unfortunately, that's not where the Dumpling Lady is and she's nowhere to be found. So, despondent and in dismay, I head towards some izakaya place for some (hopefully) decent ramen. And somehow, by some stroke of luck, I drive by Birdsong Tap House and there in the parking lot is a red trailer... Where the Dumpling Lady lives.   The Dumpling Lady hails from Szechwan, home of the giant panda and some of the burningest, most ass firing, toilet humbling food on earth. The Dumpling Lady and her husband don't dumb their food down and definitely do not water it down. A variety of noodle and dumpling dishes grace the menu, stuff the likes of Charlotte has never seen. I got an order of beef noodles swimming in chili oil, with marinated bamboo and tender chunks of beef, as well as an order of pork and leek dumplings doused with a spicy soy and scallions. Both were phenomenal, better than most I've had even back in Los Angeles. Spicy, yes, but that's what Birdsong is for. Get yourself an IPA and douse that burning sissy boy.   In all seriousness, this is a great sign for things to Come in CLT. Talking to the Dumpling Lady and Mr. Dumpling Lady, they've got great plans for Charlotte, and judging by the responses of the other patrons, they'll be hotly welcomed by the locals. Apparently, the NoDa address is their home base, but the trailer travels. This was their first night at Birdsong, but expect to find them at Atherton as well as NoDa.   Best of luck to you Mr and Mrs Dumpling Lady!  Oh. One tip. If you're allergic to cabbage, don't eat the kimchee."}
{"text":"These are the best dumpling EVER!   If you haven't tried pls do..   You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yesssss - this lady is legit, some of the more authentic Chinese food I've had in Charlotte. The noodles with sausage are out of this world! The dumplings are all amazing! The chicken and rice was just so so. Warning - must love garlic!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some spicy Dumplings or Noodles, these are HOT It's not enough food to take away my hunger but I've been at this truck about 3 times so far and always had a great appetizer."}
{"text":"We tried this spot at the NoDa Company Store. The food was fresh and the people who worked there were very friendly. We shared the buns and the dumplings. The dumplings were amazing and we loved them. The buns weren't great - they kind of fell apart. That being said, I would come back here for the dumplings alone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed The Dumpling Lady's dishes for the first time today and will absolutely be a frequent customer! We had the pork & chive, and the chicken & shrimp dumplings, they were awesome! We loved the sauce and fresh cilantro on top. What a great, unique spot! Best part is, we took some frozen dumplings home for another day! The service was fantastic and The dumpling lady even packed is extra sauce since we loved it so much! Can't wait to go back.  Follow her @thedumplinglady to find where she is! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite food trucks! The menu is very simple but the food is great. I did the lunch combo where you get noodles and a small portion of dumplings for $12.99- a little steep for lunch but it was SO much food so it was worth it in my opinion.   The dumplings are light, flavorful and have a great texture to them. I did the pork and chive and they were the best dumplings I've had in a long time.  The noodle dish was good, but way overshadowed by the dumplings (they were a tough act to follow). I had the Zha Jiang Noodles which were the less spicy option with ground sausage. The noodles had a nice, mild flavor and were very filling. The only changes I'd make to this dish would be more meat options like chicken and pork belly and more vegetables to balance it out.   Overall I really liked this food truck and will definitely return. The dumplings are the star of the show by far and id honestly recommend just getting a big serving of the dumplings for lunch! Next time I want to try the rice bowls and the bao buns."}
{"text":"It is the best Chinese that I ever had in the U.S. The owner spend 7 hours on cooking the beef!! It is so good! Dumplings are awesome! It is authentic."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food. In Charlotte, very difficult to find authentic Sichuan flavors, and this is by far the best I have found!  Make sure you get there soon enough because sometimes their lunch rush is so popular they occasionally run out of the more popular items."}
{"text":"Ah the dumpling lady! The only food I would chase. They come to my work luckily, but the dumplings are a 10/10. Any dumpling I've had there has been one I'd think about until my next visit (prob abt 10 total trips). The noodle dishes all taste the same to me and aren't as good as the dumplings (7.5/10) but are a great side w lunch combo. Note: bring water as you're in for a spicy experience!"}
{"text":"Dumpling Lady you know the way to my heart...*stomach!  Located in the heart of Noda, this food truck is located in the same parking lot as Smelly Cat Coffee and The Company Store. Craft coffee, Craft beer, hand Crafted dumplings for the trifecta!  I tell myself every time I go that this will be the time that I try the Noodles, but those dumplings are so darn good that I make a knee-jerk decision and switch at the last minute every single time. My favorite dumpling combinations is Sweet Pork Belly and Chicken & Shrimp. They cover the dumplings in a sauce made from ingredients from \"the mountains of Sichuan/fields of NC\". No idea what that means, I do know it's amazeballs (I've been witness to my husband drinking it straight from the tin...a few beers may or may not have been a contributing factor lol)."}
{"text":"Wow we finally got to try this place after a few misses and now we are hooked!  It was great my only disappointment was the shrimp dumplings had chicken in them and I wish they were just shrimp. I also think a side dish of edamame would be a nice addition.  Their sauce was one of the best I have ever had!!!  We caught them at food truck Friday at Sycamore which was a nice addition to their line-up."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of good things about this Food Truck and finally ran into it one day Uptown while I was hungry #Win. There was a little line at the window but it moved fast. She was very friendly and offered suggestions of some of her favs. The food came out pretty fast too. I ordered the chicken and shrimp dumplings as well as the spicy beef noodles. The dumplings were definitely some of the best I have had just make sure you don't have on a nice shirt because you will have red oily spots all over you (or was that just me being hungry). The spicy beef noodles were really good but definitely spicy and I love spicy.  I would absolutely recommend this truck if you were see it around town. Can't wait to try all of the other menu items especially the other dumplings."}
{"text":"I found The Dumpling Lady on instagram and have been wanting to try them out for a while. I finally caught them at a brewery and was only too excited to have authentic Chinese dumplings again. I had dumplings on a trip to Shanghai almost 10 years ago and I've been dreaming about them ever since! I tried the spicy beef noodle and the pork and chive dumplings and both were superb. The noodles were VERY SPICY but VERY DELICIOUS. The dumplings were perfectly steamed and the sauce topped them off! Will be going back for more soon."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the dumplings at the Dumpling lady. We came to the Company Store specifically to try these little dumplings. The location is great, minus the parking situation in NoDa, We grabbed a drink sat outside and ordered some crab, spicy beef and then some noodles. Everything was good, but loaded with sauce. No complaints here. Not the best dumplings I've ever had, but they were good and it made for a nice evening at The Company Store."}
{"text":"Holy Dumpling Batman!  A few friends tried some options from the Dumpling Lady while it was parked behind the Company Store in NoDa. For being one of the smallest food trucks in Charlotte, the flavors are big and bold!  I started out with the pork belly dumplings and they were delicious with wonderful flavors. I couldn't get enough of the coriander. But the problem was I wanted more! 10 dumplings just weren't enough so I went back for more. This time tried the chicken and crab dumplings as well as the beef noodles. I have to say both options were delicious but the beef noodles were my favorite. The spice level was spot on and exactly what I was looking for.  The staff is great here and they give you a pager so you don't have to hang around the food truck waiting for someone to call your name.   But one suggestion. I think the truck should be renamed to \"The Fabulous Dumpling Lady\"."}
{"text":"After living in China for two years, I thought I'd never find really authentic Chinese food when I moved to Charlotte. Sure, there are places here and there, but this is by far the best and most authentic Chinese food I've had since I've been here. And the food would have been good in China too, trust me. Can't wait to have it again next Saturday morning at Atherton Market. If only they had some baijiu to go along with it..."}
