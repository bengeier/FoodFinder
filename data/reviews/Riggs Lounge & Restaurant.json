{"text":"Riggs is a dive bar that does not disappoint. Rick is fun to talk to, knowledgeable on all things Pittsburgh and specifically local Real Estate. There is a glass jar next to register for throwing in quarters for free beer. Dart board in the back. It is fun for the occasional visit."}
{"text":"This place is everything I could ever want from a dive bar: a padded armrest, tons of beers in bottles, a friendly bartender, and darts. Could definitely do without the smoking, but to each their own. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Best dive in Northside, cool place, great prices, and cool vintage look ! Defiantly recommend if u looking for a good dive!"}
{"text":"Nice plush interior  the bar even has a cushioned arm rest on it.  Riggs doesn't have any beers on taps, they only serve bottles.  They have Coors Light bottles for $3.00, not bad not bad at all!   I really enjoyed myself at Riggs, there was a friendly atmosphere , great people and a lot of fun energy."}

{"text":"I love Riggs Lounge. It's a great dive bar. The bartender's are always friendly. The bathrooms are clean... At least the ladies room. They allow smoking, they have cigarette machine, and old booths what that old fashion warm lighting. Always have a good time in here... I go in about once a month. Great selection of beer by the way. I should've said that first. Great selection of beer, IPAs, craft."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in town. Cheap drinks and a fun bowling game in the back. Always a great hangout spot with friends."}
