{"text":"Excellent food. This place would be five stars if the wait staff was a little more on point with providing water. This is definitely a good restaurant with good clean food if you are traveling."}
{"text":"WoW - our first time and we will certainly be back. Lots of vegetarian options. Large portions. Fabulous service too."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this place. If you're looking for middle eastern food with a twist, you've got to check this place out. Everything from the spices used in the dishes to the hot sauce- amazing- great value too!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 8 including 2 kids and 2 babies. We got a dinner reservation. Parking was easy to access behind the restaurant. The menu had quite a variety and we spent at least 10 minutes deciding what to order. Service was excellent. The food was excellent--large portions and very tasty. This is a place I'll return to if in Oakville."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed here. Outstanding middle eastern fare with a twist. If you haven't already, you MUST try the cauliflower!"}
{"text":"Usually a long wait but very good food. Authentic middle eastern food with a modern twist."}
{"text":"Had to quickly grab a bite to eat in Oakville and found this really nice place.  I was greeted and seated promptly. I let the server pick my meal letting her know that I do eat meat (as they offer many vegetarian options) and that I was looking for a \"medium size\" meal. I quickly received a lovely dish that was very pleasing, chicken and beef on a bed of hummus with a beet salad and fresh warm and spiced pita bread. Presentation was thought out and functional. The meat was well seasoned and true to Mediterranean cuisine. The portion size was excellent. I will definitely return to and recommend this family owned bistro."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome. The food was incredible - really beautiful presentation and generous portion sizes for the prices. The flavours were just as beautiful as the dishes itself. Modern, trendy wooden tables and exposed brick on the interior. A cute 3-table patio out front for people watching. Owner and server were both extremely friendly and helpful. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great food - very original and delicious. Nice portions also. Possibly the best middle eastern food in Oakville."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. Fantastic service. If you haven't been before tell the staff that you haven't and you might just be lucky enough to have the owner prepare a special meal for you. 

We went for the first time tonight and we're served a kale salad, fried cauliflower on hummus with pita and fire grilled veggies, tandoori chicken on roasted garlic potatoes and finished with their home-made baklava. All of it was so freaking delicious! There was so much flavour in everything that just made my taste buds sing! I could not stop exclaiming at how good everything was while I was eating it. If I hadn't already eaten so much I could burst, I would have asked for seconds of everything!

We cannot wait to go back and also to bring friends and family! I think I've found my new obsession :)"}
{"text":"The food and the service were great. So far, it's my favourite Mediterranean restaurant in Oakville"}
{"text":"Very quaint atmosphere. Good selection of dishes. Food is DELICIOUS and portions are generous. Prices are frankly extremely cheap. Service was wonderful. Definitely would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest...this is a shwarma place.  The burritos are just shwarma pitas wrapped in a tortilla.  I went once a few years ago and swore to never go back, but I gave it a second chance recently and totally regret it.  Even the shwarma is second rate at best."}
{"text":"Thoroughly impressed. Restaurant was very clean, decor was cool, staff were friendly, and food tasted amazing. Portions looked very large in size

I had the chicken shawarma combo with potato wedges and pop. To be honest, this was incredible. I asked them when I came in what would be the best thing I should try, he said I should have the burrito bowl or one of the signature items from the menu. Given I didn't know what some of them were, I elected to the item I though was most familiar. After chatting with the cook when I finished eating, he described to me what the other items were in much more detail and I would definitely eat everything on their menu.

Maro's has been added permanently to my lunch rotation and I am definitely recommending this place to everyone."}
{"text":"My husband and I have come here twice in the last month. Even though we had high expectations having read reviews, we were taken aback by the deliciousness of the food. 

The first time, I ordered a dish called 'Memories of Persia', which was chunks of beef marinated with this amazing pomegranate sauce and served with potatoes. I can safely say I've never had beef this rich and flavourful. The second visit, I opted for one of their vegan bowls - a seriously yummy kale salad which was very filling and easily held its own among the non-vegetarian dishes. My husband had their signature chicken dishes, lunch in Beirut and the chicken shawarma - and he rated them very highly compared to others that he's tried. I also tried their Persian tea and Turkish coffee - both of which were very enjoyable.

You can tell that the owner and his staff put a lot of soul into their menu and its execution. This place really seems like a labour of love and we are excited to keep coming back and trying new things from the menu!"}
{"text":"Super cool little local place with really interesting dishes. It's Middle Eastern but not your typical shawarma/falafel joint. They've got more Persian/Leb stuff that I'd never heard of before and is delicious, as well as the not-so-obvious addition of burritos and quesadillas!! Cool plating and combinations (falafel burrito? Sure, why not.) If you are accommodating vegan/veggie/GF people, this is a great spot, as it is just as delicious for meat and gluten eaters! Note that it is not licensed and can be pretty loud when full."}
{"text":"Well what can I say! 
It was on Yelp me and my hubby found Maro's about 7/8 months ago. On a desperate hunt for some good food! 
It has become our very own kitchen dining room lol!
We just can't get enough of Maro's! The staff like all the staff Maro himself, Stuart, Natalia and names we forget apologies! There's never a time that we don't feel at home here! 
The atmosphere and the food is buzzing and an explosion of flavours! 
We always go in thinking ok today we won't eat so much, but our greed for this grub gets the best of us! 
Too many favourite dishes to name OMG!
Looking for a chilled place with the best food in town and service this is your place!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place instead of going to our usual stop at Adonis. Great fusion Mediterranean joint on the strip. Unique plating of their entrees which made it a fun experience. The fish fillet was a bit salty but I still enjoyed my meal. The pita here is toasted which is different and needs getting used to if you like the traditional soft pita. Atmosphere is casual with a bit of a downtown hip vibe. Seating is communal altho there are some smaller tables and a counter. 

Service is a bit flaky. A lady ordered her meal to pickup 10min prior to arriving and the staff totally forgot to make it for her. One of the lady servers was clearly focused on something else as she didn't give us her 100% attention while serving us our meals.

I'd only come back if Adonis was packed or if I was hungry past 10pm (which is when Adonis closes).

Nice try, but lacks the good service element. Maybe try ordering for take out, but you might want to call right before you arrive to be sure they made the order for you..."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is amazing, and they offer many vegetarian options which is great for me and my family.  All the dishes that I have tried there are delicious, every time I try something new, it becomes my new favorite!  
Also, the owner is absolutely fabulous with kids, my son loves going there.  There is no actual kids menu, but the owner is able to find healthy foods for even picky eaters.
The prices are also definitely on point with the amount of food given, I usually get to enjoy my meal twice :0).
Has become one of my new food addictions!  Lol."}
{"text":"The falafels were amazing , nice crunchy and flavourful 
This place has some nice combinations to fulfill different palletes. The pita served with entrees was cold , would've preferred warm and toasty but probably that's just my preference"}
{"text":"Food is good, very fresh and unique approach. Would have given them more stars but the owner needs to do a better Job with how he speaks to his customers."}
{"text":"Maro's food is absolutely delicious! I've had the Lunch in Beirut twice and both times it was amazing. Big enough portion for two. Restaurant is crowded and a bit disorganized, but worth it for the food."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent. Usually get the burrito (very large) and wedges. Been going here for years. Maro is an interesting guy, who is really good at what he does. Nothing but good things to say."}
{"text":"Perfectly balanced spices in the Speciality dishes. 
Fresh ingredients, lots of vegetarian and gluten free options. Friendly and quite fast - but you don't want to rush quality. 
A fantastic find. I will be back to try a burrito bowl!"}
{"text":"How have I never been here before?!?! My boyfriend and I visited Maro's on a Friday night around 6pm. By 6:30 the place was packed! It's a lovely little restaurant with a very home-like feel to it. The food was absolutely delicious. For starters we ordered a variety of dips (hummus, eggplant, tomato etc). For main meal we ordered the chicken croquettes and the Lebanese cevapi. So delicious and the presentation was excellent - very modern and unique.  And the portion sizes are HUGE. Definitely no complaints there. The Turkish coffee and baklava that we had for dessert for served in a very traditional Turkish plate set, with plates that came straight from Sarajevo, Bosnia. What a great touch! I would recommend this restaurant to EVERYONE. Will definitely be back.  Thank you Maro's!"}
{"text":"Food, service, atmosphere- all deserve a 5 star rating. Maro, you've created a real gem on Kerr. Hands down the best hummus I've had. The prices are cheap, but the quantity and quality of the food is outstanding. I highly recommend the Phoenicia Garden Bowl."}
{"text":"Very good food. Modern twist to your typical shawarma. Everything tastes amazing."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Tried it for lunch today and everything was perfect, food, service and atmosphere. Just to die for!!!"}
{"text":"Their shawarma wraps are terrible the chicken is always dry, Thier steak burritos used to be really good and then they changed the quality of steak they used and now its really bad. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"There are many aspects of reviewing a restaurant.  By far the most important one is the quality of the food itself--the raw materials that are used to make the dishes on the menu.  This is one of those places where FRESHNESS is important to them, and it shows.  The ingredients in those delicious pitas and HUGE burritos are so fresh, the taste like they came from my vegetable garden.  The food is heavenly and scrum-diddly-umptious!

This is a basic restaurant--no fancy ambiance--but it is clean, and the chef is passionate about his work.  He isn't just watching the clock, waiting for his day to end.  He fixes each dish, and waits with eager anticipation to see if you like what he just fixed you.  Food prepared by someone who cares always tastes better than when it is made by someone who is just eager to go home. 

I travel frequently, and have favorite places in every city I visit.  This place is on my MUST DO list when I am in Toronto -- and with all that Toronto has to offer, there is no place else on my MUST DO list in TO.  

Having spent quite a bit of time in Mexico, I know the burritos here are not Mexican, but they taste FANTASTIC, and are packed with fresh, savory flavors!  

If you want fresh, reasonably priced food that tastes delicious and is made by a passionate Persian---look no further, you have found the promised land."}
{"text":"What an amazing restaurant! We have a lot of eating restrictions in our family -- a deathly allergy to shellfish, vegans and vegetarians, and carnivores who can't get behind plant-based eating (plus six year olds). Maro's gave us the first opportunity in a long time to eat out as a family and it was so lovely. The food was over-the-top amazing, and given the size of our party (11), it's impressive that everyone was so happy with their food. They accommodated us so well with options for the kids and allowed us to store our birthday cake in the back. The service was a bit slow, but so well worth the wait. We will be coming back again and again (and again). Great atmosphere, great food!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch here with my family and it was amazing! We are total foodies and this was not only some of the best Lebanese food we've ever had but just some of the best food overall!!  The owner was wonderful and picked our menu for us. The food was healthy, delicious, and fresh. If I could, I'd eat there every day!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service.
Have the fried cauliflower with hummus as a starter and save room for the baklava! Melts in your mouth, yummy."}
{"text":"Been to Maro's a few times really good place to go if your on a health kick or training for any sport food is fresh well prepared staff work hard and are professional"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great decore, great good. Details are all taken care of by Maro. Best brunch in Oakville!"}
{"text":"The search for new food in Oakville continues.  Yelp helped me find Pitas & Burritos.  Thanks to Graham M., I enjoyed an enormous, delicious chicken burrito.  The combo includes a drink and a bag of chips.  If you want to swap the chips for a salad, wedges or rice there's a small additional charge.  More than enough food to get me through the work day.  I'm actually impressed I finished it all!

The owner was extremely nice.  He seemed to be working all alone though so it took a little while for the food. 

Did I mention they offer Jumex?"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this restaurant. 



Food is good not too bad.
Nice atmosphere 
Service is good.
I ordered burrito bowls with falafel and I paid 20$ for this bowl."}
{"text":"Great food, big portions, inexpensive. With both takeout and dine-in, the service is very quick. With that said, it can be hectic in there at times with lots of people not sure of where they should stand as they wait for food. Still, it's a great dining experience and a must-have in Oakville."}
{"text":"Mediterranean restaurants (most) usually generate a connotation of falafel, shawarma, hummus and rice. I can almost picture a plate with all these and that's what I expected from this place really. But I was (and I am glad) wrong. 

The food is eclectic and unique. I haven't seen these many choices on a Mediterranean menu before. I could have ordered any thing because all of them sounded interesting. I had a Moroccan plate that included cous cous served over chick peas and sauted vegetables. I also had chicken shawarma along with it. The dish was full of flavours and the chicken shawarma was the best I have had lately. The chicken was tender and juicy and it was delicious spiced. The quantity was plentiful and the quality rich."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had 2 friends recommend Moro's and it certainly lived up to expectations.  Amazing and tasty food, great service and reasonable.  I could see this easily becoming a weekly go to for me and my family...."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service is a bit slow because it's always packed, which is probably a good thing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great atmosphere and very clean! There are many (healthy) options on the menu and portion sizes are generous. Definitely going to visit again!"}
{"text":"There's something about this place and the spices they use that keeps me coming back for more. Even the hummus I couldn't stop eating. I recommend getting Bella and The Beast (fries cauliflower and hummus). It doesn't look like much but boy is it filling! Their meat dishes (Memories of Persia, Lunch in Beirut, and Maro Special with chicken that I've tried so far) were also very tasty, but very hard to finish! The serving sizes are very generous so you will definitely have some food to take home!  Thanks for the good service and great food!"}
{"text":"Very nice brunch/cafe atmosphere. I got a huge head of cauliflower and it was delicious! Tastes like fried chicken mmmmmm! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My sister had been raving about Maro's and got us some takeout when I was visiting. Most Middle Eastern food in Canada is just shawarmas and falafel sandwiches, but Maro's really gives you authentic, delicious food at great prices. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The most authentic experience your senses can enjoy! Bright staff! Music is wonderful and uplifting! Smells great! Love the eco wood upgrade for decor! And Maro now has a team of experts to fill your smile with joy! Seriously a feel good place with good quality food Made with passion! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Just my bad luck. The first time I want to go try out their breakfast menu with friends on a Saturday, is the one time, I hope, they did not open at their advertised 8 am, but at 11 am. They apologized when I walked in. We were obviously disappointed because it is not easy to locate parking and gather the troops to move to a different venue, but we moved our breakfast to Kerr Str Cafe and we were not disappointed at Kerr Str Cafe. 

Lunch at Maro's at 12:30 pm was LOUD and BUSY!!! Lots of school boys and take outs happening at the same time, in such a small space. Clearly a very popular lunch location. Go at 12 pm, or earlier. Or, after 1:30 pm. The food was delicious! I love all of the menu options. Real food. Fresh. Flavourful. Made with some care. A small amount of grit (crunchy sand) was in my eggplant tomato side, but that could happen anywhere.  I highly recommend this restaurant to friends."}
{"text":"My entire family has been coming to Maro's since I can remember and it has always been THE spot to get your hands on a good burritos (and trust me when I say I've had my fair share of all things burrito). But these burritos aren't just good, they are undeniably the best thing to have graced my taste buds. So much so that Maro's has become a weekly ritual, especially with their patio seating this summer.

I know I've only talked about their burritos/burrito bowls but you won't be disappointed with anything on the menu. There is literally something for everyone. The Bella and the Beast is one of my all time faves and the baklava ... well let's just say I've contemplated ordering multiple. Also, I should mention their Turkish coffee goes very very well with the baklava!

Would recommended to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"Very likely the best middle eastern food in Oakville. Everything is so flavorful and presented so beautifully. The menu is great and has a lot of healthy and vegetarian/vegan items available. I also really appreciate that everything is halal. I had the Green Kale Bowl,  Lunch in Beirut and Bella and the Beast everything was delicious and super fresh. My favorites were the kale bowl and lunch in beirut would definitely order those again. I also had the Persian tea which was a delightful end to the meal. Portions are very generous and perfect for sharing this is a great place to have a nice family meal. The service was good as well and very quick. I only wish I had come to this place sooner and am looking forward to visiting again to try other items from the menu."}
{"text":"Came with my dad had the macro special, tabouleh and the taste of Beirut. The macro special was good. Vinegrette on the salad was good. The chicken felt as if it was sitting on the pass for a while but it was seasoned well. I would have loved to get more salad and chicken as opposed to rice. The tabouleh was as expected: fresh and full of flavour. The taste of Beirut was more like a chicken shawarma deconstructed on a plate. It was pleasantly filling. Overall a cool, little place that captures was good, inexpensive food should be."}
{"text":"Just plain amazing!  Everything was super fresh and super tasty. Don't let the portions fool you, they're very filling. 

This will probably be our \"go to\" restaurant for middle-eastern cuisine. 

Well done Maro's!"}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday. The place was busy and we didn't have a reservation, but they were able to seat us. We ordered the \"feast\" and the food was amazing! The waitstaff were knowledgable and kind. Definitely try the cauliflower here!!"}
{"text":"If you only get to get one meal in Oakville as a tourist, this is the place. All healthy, colorful and flavorful Mediterranean dishes that puts you through the middle astern journey. Try baghlavas for the sweet finish ;-)"}
{"text":"Now THIS is middle eastern food. Absolutely AMAZING. From the decor, to our server and of course the food, it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The food was delicious, FRESH, and filled with flavours. I ordered \"Lunch in Beirut\" and I have leftovers that I cant wait to eat today, lol. 

Can't wait to bring back my family to try it. 

Def. a go to spot! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Busy place on a Sunday afternoon!  Friendly service and we timed our arrival perfectly for a vacated 2 top!

Great variety on the menu.  Ordered the green kale bowl and the lunch in Beirut.  That is by far the best kale salad I have ever had, EVER!!  Huge portion and all fresh ingredients.

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Maro's Bistro is one happening place whether you are going for lunch, dinner, or take out. Their attention to detail, fun atmosphere just make this a must go to restaurant,"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food and service. Had lunch where the portions were large and very reasonably priced. Had the Persian tea (be careful - very addictive) and shared some hummus as a starter. My friend had the burrito bowl and I had a mountain of kale with an entire head of cauliflower (can't remember the name of the dish). Both meals were excellent. Lots of vegetarian options and well identified on the menu. The service was great - quick and helpful. 
I would recommend for a casual lunch / dinner and would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went on a Saturday night around 630 and it was very busy but we waited maybe 10-15 minutes to get a table. The food was incredible. I had the burrito with chicken shawarma, and my friend had the fried cauliflower. Both were fresh and flavourful! There are lots of options for vegetarians on the menu as well which is nice. I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place for dating, located in a lovely downtown area.  Food is colorful and healthy. Not pricy. Will visit again if get the chance."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday on a Sunday. Place was buzzing. We were a group of 13 so we got the $25 tasting menu which was recommended by owner Maro who you will see running around the restaurant with his bubbly personality. Every dish was phenomenal my favourites were the cauliflower falafel and beef. Best middle eastern food in the city hands down. P.S Make sure you make a reservation."}
{"text":"My son has been coming here since Maro opened his doors.  

He is a regular and is treated as such. He brings his school friends here and has also brought their parents here too! 

Everyone who knows him there treats him so wonderful.

We come here for all our birthdays and mother's day. 

This mother's day Maro gave me some of the Persian tea he custom makes for the restaurant. 

I have never had a bad experience, and as time has gone on he has gotten really busy, but the food is worth the wait!

I recently ordered take away and was told it was busy so it would be about 30 minutes, I arrived after 20 minutes and it was ready!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I can tell its real and good quality food made with care. Fresh veggies, juicy meat, just how i like it. The only negative was that there was only one waiter to serve the entire restaurant on a friday night, but even so she was so nice and helpful. I got the Kale Salad with persian tea, and it was perrrrfect. I would recommend anyone to try this restaurant. Go Maro."}
{"text":"Periodic visit to Oakville and this is a must visit spot, but, you'll need to be patient to be seated at Maro's because the secret is out.  Every seat is filled and patrons are waiting to be seated or to take away.  A happy vibe by satisfied diners ordering and eating from a well rounded menu featuring items which are labeled V and GF where appropriate.  My favorite is the Dandelion Salad for a lighter choice and when I'd like s bit more, I'm enjoying the \"Lunch in Beirut\" which is sauteed onion, peppers with marinated beef or chicken served on a bed of homemade hummus and a beet salad.  I omit the pita, everything else is GF.

Oh, and there is the Persian spiced tea service which is a must for all of you tea drinkers out there. Arromatic and tasty, brewed in a Samovar which is fantastic."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is always delicious and fresh. Portion size is very generous. The owner is so friendly and always willing to make some changes to customized your need . I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Simply a great causal restaurant with delicious food."}
{"text":"Tasty and reasonably priced. A little crammed and uncomfortable but excellent service otherwise. Very unique flavours and a real change than a lot of the typical \"middle eastern\" food shops. The presentation and quality of food ingredients is also fantastic. Can almost guarantee this will be one of your regular spots."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner, really wasn't expecting much, end d up loving the place. Great ambience, and the good is amazing. Loved everything we had there, and the service was great."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the flavours and presentation of the food. It was pricey but the taste is great and the portion size was large for a lunch. We could not finished it all and had to take some home. I like the personal touches in the restaurant as it made me feel connected with the establishment."}
{"text":"I'm surprised it's taken me this long to write a review about this restaurant.  I remember going here one day with my friends back when it was called Pitas & Burritos.  We were one of his first customers and I've been coming back since then.  I haven't had anything other than the burrito (which is massive) and I devour it every single time.  I've watched it grow from a take out style shawarma place to a bustling Persian restaurant.  Kudos to Maro!"}
{"text":"I loved the place...it's so cozy and lovely and the food was stylish and tasty..

People who work there are amazingly friendly..and prices are so reasonable 

Just loved every single detail about that place."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! Healthy, flavourful and delicious. A MUST TRY. This has to be my 4th time visiting maro's and this time had brought the whole family. The interior design is very unique and tasteful and the services is decent. The portions are great, lots left over. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Try the Persian tea and the Simply Love - love the service , food was scrumptious and  the ambiance was great!!! Lunch in Beirut was great as well with a generous portion size. Def coming back here"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for great falafels, hummus and a lot of veggie options. Loved the veggie tower and warm service.. will be back soon!"}
{"text":"the chicken shawarma plate I had was Amazing. a very  creative spin to this dish. there is a reason it's top rated on TripAdvisor . if your in the area it is a must visit. Get the shawarma plate, you will not be disappointed. I too away one star because the restaurant seating area sucks. Anytime the door opens a draft of air comes and really gets annoying."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Amazing food. 
Maro served us, he went above and beyond for our large group of 13. 
We had the opportunity to taste all menu items. This is truly food you can feel good about. A variety of meat, vegetarian and vegan options, fresh flavours and nicely plated! 
I can't wait to return for more!"}
{"text":"Pros: 1. server seemed kind and made sure my food allergies were respected by the cook. 2. most of the food ordered by people in our group was pretty good Cons: 1. We were 5 people. It took 1 hour for us to get our food at lunch (same for the other people eating lunch there). 2. the restaurant was so loud that we all had headaches by the end 3. my meal was bad tasting and gave me indigestion

I definitely don't recommend it, and I will definitely never go there again."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. The menu is just the right size, and features both meat and vegan friendly options. I got the Phoenician Garden, as suggested by the server, and was very pleased with my decision. The hummus is incredibly tasty, and the potato wedges were so good. - Service was fast, friendly, and honest."}
{"text":"Good people, great food, amazing experience over all. Must try. Chef Joe is AMAZING, he'll make the best plate"}
{"text":"I am being generous and giving Maro's 2 stars for one reason, and that is because the food is decent. I work in a popular Middle Eastern restaurant in Downtown Toronto, so I have something to compare it to. I had the \"Zanjabeel Style\" sandwich. Even though it was served inside a flour tortilla like a burrito and NOT an authentic pita, it was still quite tasty as the vegetables were very fresh. I was dining with my aunt, she had the \"Lunch in Beirut\" with beef and also found her food to be quite decent. 

Now let me tell you why I will never go to this restaurant ever again. THE SERVICE WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. Once seated, it took at least ten minutes before we were approached by a server. She was polite, but you could tell she was very inexperienced. After I received my entree, I decided I wanted a salad to accompany my meal and it took several attempts to get her to bring me a menu. It only got worse from there. An experienced server would know that I am planning to order something and come back to check in, she never came back and I gave up on ordering anything else. Once the bill came we payed cash and tipped over 20 percent as to avoid waiting any longer for change. On the way out a man with very beautiful eyes( who I believe is the owner) held the door for us and asked how everything was. I didn't have the heart to tell him our experience was awful and that he needs to hire better staff."}
{"text":"Great good as it comes out hot and fresh, service is quick and the people are always coming out to make sure everything is okay. It's not that big but they do have some outdoor seating"}
{"text":"The food and ambience at Maro's is fantastic, filled with delicious flavours, joyful music and friendly staff.

I enjoyed a Turkish coffee while I waited for takeout. The presentation was lovely, plus the saffron sugar added a lovely touch. 

Although I'm not vegan, some of my friends are, plus I eat a lot of plant-based dishes, so it was nice to see many options on the menu. I tried Bella and the Beast (the couscous was delicious and the cauliflower was nice too) and Phoenicia Garden (asked to hold the peppers); the ingredients were fresh. I added authentic chicken shawarma and it complemented the other dishes well.

I got the baklava bites for dessert; the perfect amount of sweetness and incredibly fresh.

I'll definitely be back and I'll dine in next time!"}
{"text":"Not sure what people see in this place, over priced, underwhelming, and feels like a cafeteria kitchen. Not tasty, not good atmosphere, our food literally was plunked down with annoyance. One star, one time, never again!"}
{"text":"We went to Maro's for mother's day. It's a nice resto with colourful decor and a wonderful fragrance of spices and herbs. 
We ordered the cauliflower, a couple of salads, a burrito, and a persian beef dish. The salads had a lovely saffron dressing. The cauliflower was partially burnt. The parts that were perfectly cooked were nice and crispy, but the burnt areas, bitter. The persian beef was a huge tower of beef with a little veg tossed in. This is a share restaurant. I don't think the entrees are standalone plates. You need to order a meat, a green, and a bread or rice for balance. The portions are good, probably too much for 1person. The salad with a side of chicken and bread is plenty for 2. So we had plenty of leftovers.

I left upset because of the bottomless persian tea. One would think it's refillable by the name. My child, who loves tea, kept asking for refills since it's a small cup. By the end of the meal he had drank $16 of tea and was still asking for more. They should have mentioned that it's not a refill beverage."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly.   The place is way too busy for the amount of staff they have - great great place but wish they had just one more person helping out.  It's hard to complain about checking in on us when they're working as hard as they do.  Again, food and staff were incredible just a little short handed for a weekend.  I will go bsck and i would recommend it too!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is amazing with big portions. Service is also very good. The place has a nice vibe and ambiance."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Mediterranean restaurant in the middle of downtown Oakville. 

Owner operated by a very involved owner by the name of \"Maro\"! Maro made our small group of 4 people feel well cared for. He waited on our table himself (along with others), he explained the food, what went into the dish & was just an excellent all around host. 

We ordered a total of four dishes for sharing...Lunch in Beirut, Here Comes the Bride, Marhaba & Mediterranean Pearl. All the dishes were just delectable beyond belief. The food was hand prepared & looked & tasted \"REAL\"! At the end of the meal Maro served us complimentary Falafels which were the best tasting Falafels is ever tasted! The never ending Pita was an excellent touch. 

So if your in Oakville & feel like some Mediterranean Infusion I HIGHLY recommend Maro's Bistro! 

One point...no Liquor License."}
{"text":"This place is amazing !! It was my first time in Oakville and had no idea where to eat. Decided to go on yelp and just give this place a try. The manager went above and beyond to service us. It's seldom that you still have that service around. I would definitely give this place a try if you're in Oakville !"}
{"text":"I usually like most items I try on the menu here; especially the vegan options although I can't say the same for beef shawarma. The chunks were too thick and the meat was far from tender. It was a little too chewy. The hummus underneath was to die for. The traditional tea had a very strong chlorine smell, it would have been way more delicious if they have used filtered water. The place is packed during lunch hours, the service is usually quick and efficient. The portions are enormous so they are easily shareable between two people."}
{"text":"There is nothing like it in the area. The food is always fresh and delicious. My favourites are Bella and the Beast and Lunch in Beirut but everything is delicious. Don't forget about takeout. We typically eat at the restaurant but have also ordered takeout for a crowd. It was a big hit with all our guests."}
{"text":"A super healthy option for a Middle-Eastern/Mexican fusion restaurant. The portions are perfect and delicious. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Updated: still amazing clean food. We arrived on Sunday at 7:30 and they were closing at 8pm. They never rushed us to leave or order. We had a party of   6. They had already closed their fish fryer but we could still get the other items. Friendly staff too.  

Original review:
Amazing food! The cauliflower was pure delight! Portions are very big. We had a lot of leftovers. The service was excellent. Both waitresses were extremely attentive. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Hmmm...a difficult call.  I believe this place was called \"Pita & Burritos\" and now has been renamed, Maro's.  Never been to the original resto, so I do not know whether or not they did a complete overhaul or simply changed the name and left the menu as-is.

Food was good.  \"Middle Eastern Bowl\" (essentially some hummus, baba ghanouj, middle eastern style fried eggplant salad + some sliced pitas) was $10 and Maro's Special (chicken shawarma on a bed of Greek rice w/ a side salad) was $13.25.  Lunch for 2 was ~$30, so I wouldn't exactly call the prices \"cheap\".  Portions were ok, NOT huge by any means.

With all the 5*s, I just expected to be blown away and I wasn't.  Meat quality was better than Paramount, less salty than most shawarma places (a good thing!), & menu was similar to Me Va Me which had a better fried eggplant salad.

If you've been to your fair share of Middle Eastern places, I'm sure this place will be ok in comparison.  Interior is newly reno'd, clean, & nicer than average."}
{"text":"This restaurant was AMAZING!! From the decor, to the wait staff and the best part...the food! The beef shawarma \"memories of persia\" was PERFECTLY seasoned and had a citrus tang to it. I couldn't get enough honestly. I love that this is more modern Mediterranean. You don't get a plate full of rice and you get to appreciate the other ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is busy even on Tuesday. The food is tasty especially falafel. They are big and fluffy. It comes with 5 of them. The mains are good portion. We will try them again for sure."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Lots of food, seasoned well... we had leftovers to take home. Some of the items at our table included the fried cauliflower, assortment of dips and beef shwarma. I meant to take photos but I just couldn't wait to dive right into the food! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The most flavourful food, delicious, extremely large portions. My new fav spot in Oakville."}
{"text":"Made me feel very sick. Within hours of eating it, I had HORRIBLE stomach pains and  indigestion, which carried into the next day. It was the only thing I had eaten all afternoon, so I don't know what else could have caused it. Also, they are very busy and the take-out takes a while (don't go if you are in a rush). Should probably have more than 2 people cooking... with a full to the brim restaurant and half a dozen people walking in for take-out, AND people ordering via phone and coming to pick-up.  And to be honest, salads should not take 20 minutes to prepare. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Everything I want to say about Maro's has already been said.  Great good, great service, great shawarmas, great Persian tea. In summary Maro's offers a great value."}
{"text":"The service is terrible.  We were seated the same time as a group beside us..they Finnished thier meal before we even got ours.  The two people on the other side got food before us..and they came half an hour after us.    Sad part is. The food is good."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 730. The hostess explained they don't specifically reserve a table for us, but we will get priority seating for when we arrive. Boy, was I glad we made reservations! 
The restaurant is small, crowded with people! Probably 10 tables. Well decorated. 
Because they are so busy,we waited for a long time for.. to be seated, take our orders,  bring out the food and even the bill. I know they tried their best. *Be patient!*  
It was worth the wait!! Huuuuuuge portions. Practically every one I saw had take out containers to go. Well priced. I recommend the fish! 
Will go back!!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday night. Food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the lunch in Beirut, the Maro special, and the Moroccan bowl. The portions were great and we got to take a bunch of leftovers home to enjoy the next day. I really enjoyed the Moroccan bowl and love that it was a vegan dish. It was delicious. They have a lot of vegetarian or vegan options."}
{"text":"First of all, if you're looking to have a glass of wine or a beer with your hummus or moutabal - this is not the place for you.  No license. However, this restaurant has a great vibe (think trendy café on steroids), so alcohol is not necessary.  If you're a tea lover (not I...as I hear all of my English ancestors turning over in their graves) you should probably try it as I was told it was delicious and it comes with little saffron infused sugar lumps.  I was so hungry I was actually tempted to just dive into those - but I resisted and saved my hunger for the \"fried cauliflower\" specialty.  I want to say it was called \"Bella and the Beast\".

Having lived in the Middle East for about 12 years, I'm a big fan of the food.  Maro's definitely doesn't disappoint here with delicious hummus, sweet and spicy couscous, and the large head of fried cauliflower (the dish also came with pickled beets and a dry coleslaw type dish).  The star of the show was actually the hummus, even though the cauliflower was delicious, and I could have eaten a bucket load of the stuff with the authentic Arabic bread. So why only 4 stars?  I found everything on the dry side.  The cauliflower was a little underseasoned, but came with a delicious sour sauce...I just needed more of the sauce (albeit I could have probably asked for more).  A friend ordered the tandoori chicken, which had the most amazing flavour, but was just a touch dry.  

Overall this is a fantastic Middle Eastern restaurant and is great for vegans, GF, vegetarians and meat lovers alike. I will definitely be back to sample some of the other Arabian delights!"}
{"text":"Wow! I have to thank my (recently converted) vegan brother, because if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be searching online for good vegan restaurants nearby. 
Luckily I stumbled upon this place, which offered plenty of vegan and non-veg options (for me!).
We entered to an almost full, trendy, modern and cozy restaurant. This place was completely opposite from what you would expect from a shawarma/falafel restaurant. The server gave us the menu and offered her recommendations. She was extremely friendly. 
I wanted something light, so I ordered the kale salad and added for an extra cost the tandoori grilled chicken. My brother ordered the veggie tower bowl, which consisted of grilled vegetables laid over hummus. He also ordered an additional order of falafel. 
I was observing the foods that were being served to people around, and the presentations were beautiful. They also would come to the table and serve you baklava if you were up to it.
Our food arrived within 10-12 minutes, and the presentation was just incredible. Our extra orders, for the price, were surprisingly large. Now to the grilled chicken...my first bite and I was in awe. That was one of the most succulent, flavourful tandoori chicken pieces I have had. It was so juicy, unlike the usual dry grilled tandoori chicken I would get at Indian restaurants. The salad was nice and fresh too. Half way through, I was extremely full, but I did not stop until I finished everything because it was too good to waste. My brother enjoyed his meal too, although I think he found the falafel a bit dry, since he didn't have any dip with it. But he did enjoy it, along with the veggie tower.
My only complaint was that it was way too noisy in there, where I could barely speak. This was not the restaurants fault, just a really rowdy crowd that day.
The prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and large serving sizes. This place is now my definite go to place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Prior to visiting Maro's, I would have always thought healthy middle-eastern was an oxymoron. Upon entering this establishment, we were greeted with warm, natural decor and hospitable service. The menu is quite unique and very well put together, I'd best describe it as Middle-Eastern with cultural twists (eg. Mexican, Italian, Greek, etc.). The portions were very generous, we had a good amount of leftovers to take home. The food was incredible and full of flavour, using fresh ingredients. You would expect this quality of food, quantity and service to come at a premium cost, however, the prices were very reasonable. I highly recommend visiting Maro's when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Customer service really good the ambiance is nice as well. We had the burrito bowl which was very refreshing and good. Veggies were definitely fresh and a good amount of shawarma chicken (some pieces were a little burnt so that's why 4 stars) otherwise this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Little gem. Reasonable prices, good service. Had their after sunset bowl with a side of chicken shawarma. Chicken tastes soo good. Kale salad was fresh. Only thing I didn't like was the eggplant and peppers were completely soaked in oil but I also didn't know what middle eastern salad meant when I ordered. Will definitely be back to try something else."}
{"text":"One of the best in Oakville. Love the lunch in Beirut! Very busy spot, come early or you may have to wait for a table. The location is great, but too small of a space for such a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a great time with my friends at Maro's. the service was fast and very friendly, the food was amazing. I had the Maro special with mixed meat (chicken and beef shawarma style) it was an enormous serving and quite cheap. The quality of the food here is authentic and the meals are well priced, I will definitely be going to Maro's again!"}
