{"text":"House made, fresh pasta is a big part of Italian cuisine for me - probably the biggest. You're not getting that here. Sadly - most places don't take the time and effort to do so.  But pretty high marks for the other elements. The sauces for the Carbonara, spicy roasted red pepper, Carmela, and others are all tasty.   Service is above the line - although can be a little rough around the edges, but they're all very, very nice. And it's BYOB - although there is a cork fee.  Takeout menu is solid, too. Good pizzas, both Sicilian and rounds. Calzones are huge and packed.  They have a great space for private events and cooking classes, including an outdoor patio when in season.  Best part is easily owners Joe and his lovely wife. Excellent, kind souls.  I think it's a great neighborhood institution - and I wish there were more of them on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem!  Don't use Google Maps or Mapquest for driving directions......William St. is one way and partially closed in the Winter.  The location is easy to find if you take an alternate route.    Cozy and charming.  BYOB/$5 corking fee.  Couldn't find street parking, but they have a valet lot for $3.    The waiter was friendly and attentive.  The mood is relaxed, so I don't recommend it if you're in a hurry.  This is a place to sit back and enjoy your company.    Fresh seafood.  I heard compliments all around the table on the chicken and lasagna  The marinara sauce has a bit of a bite, so be forewarned if you can't eat spicy food.    It was highly recommended that we make advance reservations.  The place was pleasantly full, but not overcrowded."}
{"text":"We used to love coming to this restaurant, but I must say last night will be our last.   From the beginning our service was horrible - it took our waitress over 20 minutes to even come over to the table and it was downhill from there (it was  busy, but not crazy).   There were six of us, and she opened one bottle of wine, but never asked if anyone else wanted drinks.  Four others did, but didn't get them till way past appetizers (which came out at two different times).   Our salads came out about an hour after we ordered, and dinner way after that.   The chicken and veal parm dishes were very good, as was the veal jolina.  The lamb chops looked good, but were really just average. Unfortunately I had veal piccata and specifically asked about the sauce as I am gluten sensitive - she told me lemon juice, white wine and capers.  Must say I was very surprised when my veal came out smothered in a white pasty sauce and tasted the same.  I couldn't eat it, but the waitress didn't know that because she never came back to the table until well after everyone else was done eating.  She asked me if I wanted something else, but I opted out since I didn't want to make the other guests wait for an hour while I got another entree.  One would think they would not have charged me for that meal, but alas - it was on our bill (which took another 20 minutes or so).  Overall we were all disappointed and will be on a quest to look for a new BYOB.   I don't mind a long relaxing dinner with good service and good food, but this was not it.  Time to move on."}
{"text":"One of our first finds in Pittsburgh!  Prices are fair, food is good and the service was great!  So great, that without the service, I would have rated La Tavola 3 stars.  I've had the Tortellini and the Penne Fiorentina, which were both really good!  I'm usually more of a fan of lighter foods with lots of flavor.  No oily overly saucy pastas here!  The tortellini tasted really fresh to me and the cheese wasn't overdone.  The Penne Fiorentina was also very flavorful with a nice thick sauce.  As I mentioned before, I've received excellent service at this restaurant.  The first time, our waiter was soooooooooo nice.  We barely waited for our table and he was very apologetic for the wait and kept insisting that he'd make sure to take care of us for the night.  He also made great food recommendations!  One of the suggestions was the Italian creme cake, which was delicious!  Also, this restaurant is BYOB :)"}
{"text":"I first ventured to La Tavola after it was recommended by a co-worker when I had a summer internship in Pittsburgh. I was a bit skeptical at first because one of the first things I noticed was that each table had a fairly prominent table number placed in it (much like they have at weddings and such). This wasn't something I expected from a first class establishment, nor was I expecting the bread to be served in plastic baskets. However these were both moot points as the service and food were both as good as it gets. I have been back many times over the years and though I no longer live or work in the city, I make a point to eat at La Tavola each time I visit Pittsburgh. I have brought many friends and relatives to La Tavola and they all have nothing but great things to say.   My cliff notes: -Calamari diavlo (sp?), amazing appetizer that isn't on the menu but is offered every night as far as I know. I order it every time and am never disappointed.  -Byob. Not sure what the corkage is but it rounds to zero. Enough said.  -The staff knows the menu inside out as well as any specials being offered. Most if the servers I have had are clearly there fir the long term and have a vested interest in providing the best service possible -Carmella owns the restaurant along with her husband. They also are the chefs. Very sweet people who care about their patrons, food, and having a good time -very accommodating to large groups. I've gone with just my girlfriend or with a group of 14. Food is always fantastic and I never har problems making reservations the day of, granted the day I went with 13 other friends was a weds -sometimes when they are very busy the service can be a bit slow if you are with a large party. Make sure you brig good company and good wine. -prices are very reasonable for food of the best quality -the lack of reviews in no way is representative of the amount if business they get. There are usually a few large parties every time I go and everyone always seems to have a great time -menu is not the easiest thing to read as most items are in Italian. Fortunately, the staff is always more than happy to explain anything and everything to you in as much detail as possible -pizza is amazing. Best I've had in Pittsburgh hands down. They have a little \"shop\" attached to the restaurant for take out or delivery. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian cuisine.  I had an 8 cut neapolitan pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni.  I'm a sucker for pizza, but the other four people I was with had other specials that I tried as well and all of the dishes were excellent.  Oh, also, they had delicious complimentary garlic bread that they were very generous with.  Reservations are a must; this place has gotten so popular that you can't just walk in anymore.  We saw at least one group of three get turned away at a little after 9pm.  Plan on spending a good deal of time here as the atmosphere is very relaxed, there are only a few waitstaff, and the kitchen is very busy and only has a few chefs.  This place is BYOB (where B = beer, or bottle) and they do have a cork fee.  It is $5 for a .75 liter, $7 for a 1.5 liter (or larger, I assume) and I can't remember, but I want to say $5 for each six-pack.  They will bring out an ice bucket for you to keep the alcohol cold, but we saw many people who had their own little coolers.  One person I was with said her family brought a cooler on wheels once and the staff was totally fine with it.  It really is very relaxed.  My only complaints about the place were that it was very dark and the decor was lacking, but this restaurant is definitely no frills, no nonsense, and bare bones in order to keep the overhead to a minimum.  Also, the specials on the menu don't have explanations underneath them, so you'll have to listen to the waiter/waitress when they describe what they are.  Valet parking is pretty necessary for the area and costs $3.  Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"La Tavola Italiana is definitely the place to go on Mt. Washington for a nice authentic Italian dinner. You can expect delicious food but be prepared to be there for up to two hours. The service is Eh and wait time between ordering, getting food, and paying is LONG. However, it is BYOB so bring some wine and settle in. I went here with a pretty large group which is why it took so long. For smaller parties and date nights, I think La Tavola is a great choice."}
{"text":"We usually hit up La Tavola three or four times a year and it has been a staple of ours for New Year's Eve and Valentines Day that past 4 years. This year we actually had to postpone our V Day trip until tonight, but I think I may have had the best meal yet there.  We started with the margarita pizza as an appetizer with their beans and greens. The waitress (who did a phenomenal job), suggested that we add sausage to them. I one up-ed her and asked to have the through in some fresh banana peppers as well. Awesome!  My plate was a Louisiana style penne with shrimp, chicken, and sausage. The penne was cooked perfectly and although it isn't made fresh on-site, the flavors in the plate definitely made up for it.  My wife's chicken parmesan was also excellent and the cannoli that the waitress brought us at the end topped it off."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.   If you are looking for a quiet, relaxed, and delicious dinner...this is the place. We went once for dinner and it was fantastic. Loved the BYOB, food was great, and our waiter was very knowledgable with the menu.   Recently we returned for Carmela's Cooking Class. Can't say enough about this experience. Delicious food cooked right in front of you. What other restaurant owner shows you how to make their food and gives you the recipe? Carmela sat with us after the class and talked about Italy. She made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. It felt like we were at a friend's house for dinner. It was a great experience!  If you are looking for authentic Italian food, you have to go.   If you are looking for a fun date night, you have to go.   You must try La Travola Italiana!"}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, it's BYOB and always friendly staff. Only reason I won't give it 5 stars cause the wait for your food is longer than it should be. But the food is worth the wait. One of my absolute favorites!"}
{"text":"Guest came in for the weekend and wanted to stay around the Mt Washington area.   As a local, we went to our favorite Italian and brought some wine with us.   Walked away happily served and FULL.  We all got our favorite Tortelini Crab and Shrimp.  If you haven't tried here yet you should take the time to experience an Italian secret."}
{"text":"I'll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn't she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does.   My hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn't seem to bother anyone.  So-  Do order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels.   If they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny.   Do make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don't go with a date unless you're fighting and don't feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it's available."}
{"text":"it took us a while from the Duquesne incline to get there. We waited about one hour or so till we could finally eat the food. I ordered the lazangna. I was quite satisfied with it but it was still too much for me. The food ordered by my friends however is way too long to meet their expectations."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Pittsburgh. Bring a couple of great vintage Italian wines and Let them bring you Chefs choice of food."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend here for her birthday and we were both very pleased. This is what an italian restaurant is supposed to be. Classic. We tried a few of the starters and a main course and we both left very well fed. Great food, and a great atmosphere for a nice dinner"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh.  I have been here for birthdays, dates and casual nights out.  The food is amazing and the service is great.  I am a particular fan of the Veal Romano, Eggplant Parm, Chicken Marsala.  The pastas are excellent as a main OR side dish, they are all homemade.  This is rustic Italian food at it's best, just like you would find in Italy.   Try it.. if your'e disappointed it just means you dont have an acquired taste for real Italian food."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh! Great family atmosphere and dining available for big parties. We go here all time. Calamari fra Diavlo for an appetizer! Carmela and Jolina are the best also!"}
{"text":"Nice chilled out hidden gem spot in the mount. Would def go back someday. Service was excellent an me an tge wife enjoyed our date night out. Reasonably priced food as well"}
{"text":"La Tavola is the worst meal I've had in years. Caprese salad was ice cold & laying in a river of olive oil. Then they charged $2.00 extra for blue cheese (without being told in advance) which was the best part of the salad. All that we could taste in our main dishes was salt & it was way overpriced for the lack of quality. Then to top it off, the waiter took our card, gave us everything to sign, and we've been waiting 15 minutes without the return of our card. We had to hunt down the waiter to get the card & he said \"oh Jesus it slipped into my pocket\" & pulled it out of his pants pocket. Olive Garden has better food. Since it is BYOB, that must be what brings people here...you get drunk & anything tastes good I guess."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere - relaxed and homey. Server was just \"okay\".  They make their own ranch dressing, which is a plus for me and it was very good.  The garlic bread was excellent and our server kept up on making sure we had baskets with our wine.  Meal was VERY disappointing. I was told this was the best Italian and best sauce in the city and I have experienced much better manicotti at Armstrong's in Caste Village. My sauce tasted burnt and it was lacking flavor. A friend had spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs lacked flavor as well and another did not enjoy the Mediterrian couscous at all. I had such high hopes! I doubt I'll go back and that makes me sad because I was really looking forward to making this place a favorite."}
{"text":"Fabulous service and awesome food.  We had the Italian wedding soup, the fried sampler plate, and the carbonera."}
{"text":"I've been here four times now, and each time I've been unimpressed with the food, the decor and the service. One was for dinner, and the other three times were small parties. There is FAR better Italian food to be had, so unless you live in Mt. Washington, there is no reason to make the trip here. Small portions, nothing outstanding on the menu, and mediocre service. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  The food is very well priced (ranging from $12 to $22 a plate), considering it is made from scratch when you order and delicious!  Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything.  My family hit every corner, from the special of the day, a tuna dish, to plain spaghetti, and we all loved it.    Reservations are definitely a must, and I would avoid going on a Saturday.  I was there for three hours on a Saturday, and the waiter told us it wasn't like that on any other day usually; you have to make sure you have enough time to eat and to relax.  Don't go here on a first date unless you're a talker and/or enjoy awkward silences!  The waiters are very attentive, and keep water and bread coming while you wait for your food.  It's BYOB.  I've heard of some people getting lost on the way there, as it's tucked away in Mount Washington, but I got there fine using google maps.  Parking is awful, so the $3 valet is great.    My only complaint, like some others, is that it is very dark.  They'll light the candles though and if they miss your table, the staff is totally fine with being flagged down.  They're really great.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went with wife and two kids for dinner.  We had a great time. The food was delicious, service was great and ambiance just right.  Go here!  You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here. Visiting Pittsburgh from Boston, I was at a loss for dinner places. I turned to Yelp and we ended up choosing this restaurant on Mt. Washington. The trip up the hill was pretty exciting; we saw a family of deer! It was suggested on here you make a reservation, but the restaurant was only about 1/2 full on Saturday night. A bummer because the food was great.   It's true that the menu specialties are a bit unclear, but our waitresses went through them (very) quickly. Pay attention if you plan to order off that menu. My date thought he was getting tomato sauce, but he instead received tomatoes in the dish rather than a sauce. No matter, he loved it anyway.   We started with the tomato salad which was excellent. Then I had the stuffed shells which were also very good.   Important note: the closest liquor store is about an 6-7 minute walk so make sure you come prepared with you wine or you'll have to go sans-alcohol.   Also, a huge thank you to the restaurant manager. We ordered a cab which never arrived and the valet (who's name i currently forget but his brand-new baby's name is Fenway) drove us back down the hill and to the South Side. Really, a lifesaver!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be very good. In the last couple years it has really gone downhill.  Last night it took over 1 1/2 hours for our dinner to arrive. Once it did some was not fully cooked. There was a rotten pumpkin in the ladies room that was leaking all over the floor. This was my last trip!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for a Thursday and we were seated promptly.  BYOB so we enjoyed our wine with the meal, $5 corkage charge.  Calamari and eggplant were our appetizers and were both excellent!  Lamb and veal dishes were both very good.  My daughter ordered spaghetti and meatballs which were also very good but the price of $17.95 for this is high.  Would return for another meal and I would recommend you trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in a city that has several. A BYOB restaurant tucked away on the working class side of Mt Washington serving delicious homemade Italian classics. Brought my family here when they were in town to visit and everyone came away satisfied. I wish my girlfriend still lived down the street from this place because we don't get there as often as we should."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and I really enjoyed it. Also, I had a really good experience with the waitstaff and the chef. She seems open to making you anything you're in the mood for, even if it's not on the menu. Now, full disclosure, I've only tried that during the week, it might be a little different on a busy Friday or Saturday evening. But they're always prompt and attentive as a wait staff as well. The BYOB is always a plus in my mind, and they have nice stemware and a reasonable corkage policy. The menu has a nice selection. I usually stick to the pastas, only because I love pasta so much and theirs is really good. Never had a bad meal there, either my own or others at the table that I have tried. I've been there several times, and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. One of the best in the city.  I was there twice for dinner as well. The first time our meats and pasta were great (I had the Chicken Jolina, I forget what my boyfriend had), but I'm nearly positive the side of broccoli was previously frozen. Even if it wasn't, the side was a little disappointing.   The second dinner was awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and everyone loved their food. I had the pumpkin ravioli, which was one of the daily specials. I definitely recommend it if it's available. I tried one of my friend's scallops and they were cooked perfectly.   I look forward to going back and seeing how my third trip goes. The prices are a little high, but you get a lot of food that seems to be nearly all homemade."}
{"text":"Three people from Oregon chose this restaurant based on Yelp reviews. It was a healthy walk, and a ride up the Incline, from our downtown hotel -- and TOTALLY worth it.   Our server was friendly, the bread and salad were good, the main dishes were excellent. My Veal La Tavola was absolutely delicious.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"After trekking though some unsavory parts of Mt. Washington and battling the Grandview traffic is not my cup of tea, this place makes every bit of the drive worth it.   Be warned. This is not a fancy restaurant. They believe in good food and an unpretentious atmosphere. You may be seated at a long table on vinyl chairs, but the food that appears in front of you is your Nona's Italian cooking as you remember it.   The service is slow, slow, slow!! They are fast to uncork your wine or beer (it's BYOB), but the food took such a long time to actually arrive at the table.   The pasta is phenomenal, the cabanara is my favorite. Don't be afraid to ask the waitstaff questions. They are all very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu and preparations.   Final thing is the price. It's wicked cheap if you don't uncork wine like a maniac. The quality of the food is far above what I'd expect at those prices."}
{"text":"La Tavola is my absolute favorite place to go. Byob and the best Italian food you will ever eat! The service is a little slow, but I think that's mostly bc all of the food is homemade and made to order. Love their house dressing on the salads. The spicy crab tortilini is my favorite and you MUST try the lemon sorbet dessert. This place is truly a diamond in the rough. I would certainly recommend La Tavola to everyone.  It's also great for groups/rehearsal dinners."}
{"text":"I have been to La Tavola on various occasions and am never let down. Whether it was an intimate anniversary dinner, a birthday party seating 16, or picking up food from the side kitchen to go - they are fantastic.   The scallops are cooked to perfection and the seasonal menu items are delicious (hello pumpkin and butternut squash ravioli!) I highly recommend La Tavola - make reservations for the weekends! Week nights you can get in pretty easily.   Extra bonuses: The wait staff is always friendly and informative, you never feel rushed or pushed out. BYOB - which is always fun."}
{"text":"Went here for a romantic night out with my boyfriend while on a trip in Pittsburgh. Everything was delicious, the waiter was great, and you really got a lot for your money and for how nice the place seemed."}
{"text":"The food is knockout. I come from a non-Italian background, so my experience is Olive Garden and Bravo - neither of which I care for. But the food at La Tavola, from the salad dressing, to the garlic bread, to the tiramisu is lovely. The 1st time we didn't have a reservation, but we had genuine smiles and 3 bottles of wine, the hostess found us a table and we had a great time, she was also our server. The 2nd time, reservations were made and we were even seated early (8:00) our server was non-existent. We had to get up and go get a pitcher of water for refills, and she overcharged us on the corkage fee. Supposed to be $5 for wine, she charged $7.50. The food was still amazing, so they get 4 stars - try the Chicken Jolina, named after the chef herself! They also had a number of chef's specials that sounded great - duck apple ravioli.. delicious."}
{"text":"I live in Mt. Washington and I love my neighborhood.  This is probably the best place for a night out on Mt. Wash, in my opinion.  The restaurants on Grandview are overpriced, outdated, and the food isn't that good in my opinion (yes, I'm looking at you, Monterey Bay, LeMont, Tin Angel, et al.).  I visited La Tavola for the third time since I've lived up on the Mount (where I've been for 3.5 years) on Friday, January 17.    I'll go over the positives - of which I find many - first.  First, my main course, the veal Polina, was done very well.  The veal is sliced thin and cooked (not breaded) with eggplant and proscuitto over it, and then covered with melted provolone.  I thought this was tasty and seasoned well.  It was not overcooked.  The veal was a little oily, but not so much to find it annoying.  Overall a great dish.  I went with a large party and we all brought bottles of wine.  The staff was great about opening the wine in a timely fashion, and chilling the bottles of white at the table.  The corkage fee isn't bad.  The table ordered several appetizers for the group to share.  We had beans and greans with sausage, beans and greens without sausage, fried calamari, and something else I can't immediately recall.  I found these all very good and done very well.  The calamari was not over fried, and it wasn't overbatted (I hate seeing that at restaurants).    Another positive was that they offer gluten-free (rice) pasta.  My friend who had the gluten-free pasta thought it was done well and not overcooked.  Some of the negatives were things that I didn't experience personally.  A few friends complained that their meals were cold (not warm at all).  I thought the service was kind of slow.  It took a long time to get our meals generally.  However, the server was pleasant.    They don't split more than 4 cards for a large party, but I learned this ahead of time when I  made reservations and we were encouraged to bring cash.  That worked out pretty well.  BYOB is one of my favorite features here.  The dishes themselves aren't terribly pricey, but if you get the whole nine yards - appetizers, entrees, coffee, etc. - you will be likely to shell out around $40 a person.  Overall, I thought it was a decent dining experience.  My food was good.  I think some of the negatives are service-related.  I would go back, though, and likely will."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended.  My friend told me to make reservations.  So I made reservations.   When we arrived, there were 2 big parties (~10 people each) and a few other tables were  occupied.  It was also a week night.  We skipped appetizers and went directly to dinner.  We  both had the house salad (all spring greens) with the house balsamic dressing.  I had the seafood pasta with shrimp, clams, and scallops ... holding the calamari.  It had some kick ... my lips were numb by the end.  My date had chicken parm ... huge chicken breast over linguine.  We both were able to finish the proteins but unable to join the clean plate club.  We were full and skipped dessert which sounded very good.  There is a huge parking lot next to the restaurant.  BYOB  We added the family owned & operated restaurant to the we'll be back list."}
{"text":"Quite pricey, but the food is absolutely delicious. You may get a little frustrated with how long it takes to get your food, but once you start eating, you'll realize that the wait was completely worth it. From the outside, this restaurant doesn't look like much more than a simple pizza shop; once you go in, you realize it's a full-scale fancy Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant on Mt. Washington. Perfect for a date night or a large group party. Large portions of homemade Italian, always fresh, new specials and the garlic bread is to die for! Don't forget a bottle of wine or two, it's BYOB!"}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh for a few nights and looking for a Mom and Pop Italian restaurant and did a google and came up with this spot...  What a great find!!   For starters eggplant Milanese with house made ricotta.   Absolutely one of the best eggplant dishes I've had in my life.   For dinner my one friend had Scallops Limonatta that was off the chart.... Other friend had spaghetti and meatballs.   Fantastic sauce!!     Mine was off the menu special Penne a la vodka which was made differently then anywhere else.  With Tomatoes and Prosciutto. That was so good I had to get the chef/owner out of the kitchen.  Giuseppe comes out of the kitchen and pulls up a chair and tells us his life story.   Over 50 years this neighborhood gem has been here.  Cannot go wrong at this place."}
{"text":"I attended a rehearsal dinner here, and it was very nice! Food was served family style at the tables. It was a bit difficult since so many people were put at each table, and then once the plate was passed around the table there was really no place to put it, so things did become a little crowded. Aside from that though, the food was excellent! A very nice variety for big party like that. The restaurant is BYOB, which was very much appreciated, and the service was really great. A good pick for an intimate rehearsal dinner."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a number of people and always looking for a good local Italian restaurant. My first annoyance was trying to make reservations. You cannot make them online although I did email them through their website of course with no response. I called twice with no answer and was able to leave a message one time. 2 days later I got a call back and made the reservation for 3 people. There is not a lot of parking and it is not located in a great neighborhood so be warned. We were seated quickly and I read reviews that the service was slow but we ordered in a timely fashion and our food was served in no time. The restaurant is great for large parties as the have lots of seating and big round tables. The garlic bread they serve was delicious and I also ordered a bowl of Italian wedding soups one of my favorites. The soup was the real deal! All the entrees include a salad which is a great bonus and the salad had lots of toppings and comes served with a house dressing. For my entree I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. It very tasty and the meatballs and red sauce were exceptional. Those in my party order the salmon and scallops and raved about how delicious they were. Almost to full for dessert but room to  take a bite of a homemade cannoli. Also would have loved to try a homemade rum cake. My biggest complaint of the evening was the BYOB policy. One person in our party brought rum and they charged a $10 corkage fee and for the coke. We also had beer and they charge $1 per beer. Beware of the high corkage fee. Luckily the excellent food almost made up for this"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible! I don't even know where to start. The only pro in my eyes is that it's byob, however that aspect of it was promptly ruined for us as well.  To start, we walked right into what was the main dining room with no hostess stand and no hostess. We weren't even sure if we came in the correct entrance because of this fact. Finally after standing there confused for about five solid minutes, a waiter came up and acknowledged us and said someone would be right there. About three minutes later we were finally sat..Sat at an awkward table that was basically in the middle of a walkway and we felt like we were in the way of everyone walking through.  We sat there for 10 minutes without any sign of a waitress. Meanwhile we brought our own chilled wine and it was getting warmer as we sat there and waited for someone to come over, open it and acknowledge us. By time our waitress appeared we had already had time to look over the menu three times and were ready to order. She came over, opened our wine and ran away before we could even let her know we were ready to order. She comes back 20 MINUTES LATER. No exaggeration. She flat out says she forgot about us and laughs it off. Also our wine continued to get warmer because she did not bring us a chilled ice bucket for it, that every other table had except for ours. After I asked for it, we eventually got it.  Finally the food comes out and it's nothing spectacular. My friend got a regular tomato sauce dish and the taste of hers was nothing greater than a jar of ragu in my opinion. I got the tortellini dish with crab and shrimp, well the veryyyy few pieces they included. It basically was just tortellini with two pieces of shrimp mixed in, in the spiciest sauce that wasn't even enjoyable. And to top it off, we never received a refill on our water the entire time we were there.  In effort to make up for \"forgetting about us\" our waitress brought out a cannoli for the two of us to share at the end. That was the only good thing about this whole experience, but I could have forgone the cannoli for some actual legitimate service. She also brought one to another table, by surprise it seemed, so I wonder if she just neglects all her tables and uses that end trick? Who knows.   Overall this place was awful. It also was so loud we could barely hear each other talk. Stay away. You can find better food and certainly better service almost anywhere else!"}
{"text":"My love affair with BYOBs continues...   I went here on a date with my man friend on a friday night. Although I am mildly familiar with Mt Wash this place was still hard to find. After we found it and valeted my go-cart we were greeted by a huge party at the door (general mayhem).  I love when restaurants are busy, loud, and hectic (I'm not much for quiet intimate dining). My date made a res which was clutch because this place was packed!    We sat around 8:50 (our res was at 8:30) but we were in no rush and had fun talking to the large party waiting to sit. We were sat next to another large party this one was already a couple bottles of wine deep when we sat down (more on them later).   The service was a tad on the slow side but the place was packed. The server Katie was really knowledgeable and funny. My date and I were joking around with her all night. She was also on point with all of the specials.   We started with special zucchini app. Which was solid, nothing over the top. But a solid dish. I had a spicy shrimp dish and my date had the chicken romano. When they bought these dishes out his looked like a pizza because it was a HUGE portion of lightly breaded chicken in a round shape. Again this PORTION WAS HUGE!!!! It completely covered the plate. Mine was really good, spicy but good! I couldn't finish all of it.   I think my favorite part of the meal was just the interactions between tables ( I think wine helps this). The large party next to us was a group of 12 65 year olds who went to high school together. They kept chatting with us all night. One guy came over to our table (bombed) and chatted with us for 20 minutes about complete non-sense... hilarious.  Then another table came over making fun of the bombed guy! Generally a lively dinner!    PROS: BYOB, Large menu, A lot of specials, Owner chats you when you are waiting for your food, lively, knowledgeable servers, funny co-diners, BYOB,   CONS: Slower service, Valet Parking, corkage fee  OVERALL: Will go back, I'm not sure if it will be as entertaining tho!"}
{"text":"I know people love this place. We used to go there when they first started out but haven't been back in about 10 years after some bad experiences. But we decided to give it another try. Valet parking? Really? This place is not fancy given the decor, noise level and below average service. My husband ordered the only vegetarian entree eggplant parmigiana. It was thick rubbery slices of eggplant not breaded or grilled in 3 layers with a basic red sauce and cheese on top. Inedible. I ordered the salmon which came on some undressed arugula with some orange oil on the bottom of the plate. The side was a scoop of mushy mixed vegetables which the server had described as grilled. Had my entree come maybe with a side of pasta maybe I wouldn't have left still hungry. That was $75 I would like to have back. There are too many good restaurants to waste your money on this place. Come on Joe and Carmella you can do better than this!"}
{"text":"Ahhh, what a great place! I stopped by here in mid-May with my cousin and I would come in here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. The owners were incredibly nice and you could tell that this is good old-fashioned family owned business. The pizza was mouth-watering and I really loved my veal parm sub. I would highly recommend this place and I hope I can stop in again someday!"}
{"text":"I think it changed owners since the last time I was there....not sure...They used to have delicious homemade Italian pasta or lasagna and no authentic pastas were even on the menu. I was looking forward to it too and was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered Veal Marsalla (about 23) and and Eggplant Parmigiano appetizer (about $12). Unfortunately the Eggplant was bland and the veal although tender was not very flavorful and quite oily. The service is also not entirely friendly and the prices were above average. However, only for the quality of the food the place is most definitely overpriced! Not recommended."}
{"text":"Party planners BEWARE! We had our sons and daughter-in-laws rehearsal dinner here in October and when I received the bill I had asked if the gratuity was included and was told no so I tipped but two days later when I questioned why our bill seemed so high we called the owner back and was told that the tip was in fact already added to the bill (this resulted in me paying almost $600 tip on a $1000 bill.) The owner at that time apologized and told me  she would refund me immediately. It is now almost 2 months later and she has yet to refund me despite my repeated calls. She at one point flat out lied and told me she issued a credit to my credit card. Very unprofessional not to mention against PA consumer laws. Makes me wonder how often she does this to unsuspecting parties."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 10 years. My parents stumbled on it one night while in Mt. Washington so I decided to give it a try. I've done birthday dinners and a New Year's Eve about 10 years ago there. That night was great. We made reservations and asked what they could do for a party of 14. Gave us a fixed price for family style (including corking fee.) food was awesome and plentiful.  Some Dishes I've had: Beans and greens: simple, nicely flavored and great appetizer Fried zucchini: picky about this but gave it a try. They used a light bread crumb, maybe a panko? It was decent. Not the best I've had, but good.  Linguini with clam sauce: very good. Must like garlic which I do. White sauce was light and not too laden with oil/butter.  Chicken dish with bay leaves and apples: I can't remember  the name of this dish, but it's delicious! Other pastas on the menu I've tasted and all have been very good.  My service has always been great here.  It's homey and the food is comfortable cooking."}
{"text":"This isn't one of the nicest places you'll ever eat at, especially being on Mt. Washington. you're also not getting a view. The place kind of reminds me of when my church has dinners in their basement and throws a bunch of white table clothes over some old raggedy tables. It also didn't seem like they get a lot of people of color at this place. We had a lot of people staring at us, not the staff, just other people that were eating there. We're both mixed. This place is BYOB which is great, we took a bottle of Champagne. They charged me $7.50 for uncorking it and sitting it in a bucket of ice (the cork just pulls off). I thought that was stupid but I would have spent a lot more on buying drinks there so I didn't complain. What makes this place 4 stars is that the food was AMAZING! I had the chicken parm, my girlfriend and the shrimp and crab tortellini both were great. As well as the diablo calamari. The staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"It was only a matter of time until we tried La Tavola.  I felt like every time I turned around, someone was having a birthday celebration, wedding rehearsal dinner or big meet up at the Italian joint up on the hill.  I can completely see why!  After being unable to get reservations a few days prior a few times, the wife and I secured a table and embarked on a double date with some close friends.  Walking though the front door (and to be honest, not exactly knowing where to go to find a hostess), we immediately realized this place is a family affair.  Massive dinning rooms we filled with more large (8+) parties than I think I've ever seen in a establishment.  After being sat, our server immediately greeted us and opened our bottles of wine (BYOB!), explaining the restaurant concept and current fresh offerings as he went.  While the place was definitely buzzing, it wasn't too loud that a conversation couldn't be held.  As we were figuring out what we wanted to eat, one thing that resounded to me well was the sheer amount of contact the cooks, servers and owners had with their patrons (which completely explains my inclination that this is definitely a \"regulars\" place).  After placing our orders, we were greeted with fresh garlic bread (generic, but tasty) and our appetizers (calamari and banana peppers) came out quickly.  Both were well executed, albeit a bit standard as well.  This trend continued with our entrees...  crab tortellini, porchetta, etc.  all well executed, tasty, but ultimately just missing something (we'll call it that \"finishing touch\").  I'm not a big cannoli eater, but our was one of the more delicious items we had, and the cannoli aficionado of the group definitely approved.  Overall, we left stuffed, happy and glad our wallets hadn't been crushed.  While I don't think I'll go back all the time, La Tavola will definitely be a staple recommendation for people looking for a good group dinner spot."}
{"text":"This place is BYOB which I LOVE and I remember coming here and loving it in the past - this trip was, unfortunately, not as great as I remembered.    We walk in and there are a total of 4 customers in this huge restaurant and that's including the 2 of us that just got there - yikes!  I guess it did fill up with 2 more tables by the time we left though...   Our server Yanni was great - we were his only table so we got lots of love from him which I appreciated.  I wanted the food to be better than it actually was especially since the prices were higher than I remembered.   The bread they give you is a garlic toast that I couldn't stop eating - so good.  Our apps of the breaded eggplant and the artichokes (served cold) were a great start.  They were a little heavy handed with the vinegar on the salad which is when the meal started to turn.  I got my penne in vodka sauce which was so incredibly salty.  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE salt but I couldn't figure out if it was super salty from the prosciutto or just from it being overly seasoned.  Aside from it being distractingly over salted it was just ok-the sauce didn't blow my mind.  My husband's lamb chops ordered medium rare had to be sent back due to them being too rare.  Honestly, if the restaurant were slammed it would be more forgiveable but we were the ONLY customers they were cooking for - how'd they get it wrong? I guess the lamb chops were delicious once they came back the 2nd time around.    Maybe it was an off night but we were disappointed - especially for it being more pricey than I remembered and with so many places to go/try in Pittsburgh we will, sadly, not be back."}
{"text":"Calamari diavolo is what my dreams are made of. We also got the tortellini and veal Marsala. The tortellini was absolutely wonderful! Large pieces of shrimp, generous amounts of crab- 5 stars.  The Marsala was a little lack luster - good but it seemed like the whole thing was covered in gravy, rather than a Marsala sauce. Cannoli for desert- the filling was runny, and was actually dripping out of the cannoli shell. I wasn't too impressed by that. Service was also pretty slow, which was fine since we had no where else to be. BYOB was great. $7 corkage fee for wine.  Overall- pretty good!   Oh and the ambiance was so fun. We came on a Friday night and the place was packed. Tons of old classy Yinzers drinking wine."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and the friendly owner. This restaurant is off the beaten path and not somewhere you want to walk to (we did), it's up the cable car and a very long walk away from everywhere. Arriving we looked in the window, its big, the decor lacking and dated, but the food makes up for all of that! Delicious, possibly some of the best Italian food we have eaten in or out of Italy. Priced very reasonably, next time we visit Pittsburgh we will grab an Uber and eat there again! Did we mention it's BYOB and there is car parking beside the restaurant."}
{"text":"For 9 we were easily accommodated All that was ordered was excellent  Don't forget it is byob"}
{"text":"Best Italian fare in Pittsburgh. I have been eating their pizza and hoagies for 40+ years since it was Josephines. I have never had pizza its equal anywhere. Their restaurant is fabulous. We take groups of 6-8 and everyone is always very impressed. Never had a complaint except when they brought the wrong dish to one person once. You will need reservations on weekends. Wait staff seems overly busy at times. I have seen Ben Roethlisberger eating here with large groups (family?). They have guys park your car because their lot is small and there is not much on the street. You won't go wrong with anything you order at this place. You can bring your own wine but they have a corkage fee."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband and 3 other couples last night. The food was excellent. The eggplant appetizer and calamari diavolo were delicious. All of us enjoyed our entrees. I had torteloni with crab and shrimp... Loved it although I will say I wish the waiter Yanni would have told me it'd be spicy. Homemade tiramisu and limoncello were fantastic. Service was a bit slow... Some at the table minded but I loved relaxing between courses and enjoyed my friends' company... Looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"LOVED this place; the reason for 3 stars is upsetting to me, because honestly La Tavola has potential for a 5 and believe me, I want automatically to give any decent Italian restaurant a 5.  I ordered pasta with scallops and it came with ONE scallop. Our waitress was kind enough to let us know that it would be $6 if I wanted another one-scallop. I was super disappointed by this. Also, they just offer valet parking, which just doesn't seem right, since they really aren't that fancy of an establishment.   Aside from that, the pasta was VERY good. Our server was amazing and helpful and was able to answer all questions we had. They were also able to take our last-minute reservation (we called an hour before arriving)! I would certainly return, but for a $23 pasta dish, I am hoping for more than one scallop!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of family-owned, non-chain Italian restaurants.  I was eager to try La Tavola and had great expectations after reading the many positive reviews.  Therefore, I trusted that this would be a good place to have my Italian father's birthday.    I was so wrong.  First, the temperature in the restaurant was unbearably hot.  It was over 85 degrees inside.  My face was sweating after 20 minutes. And when you're about to eat heavy, hot Italian food, it becomes so unappetizing.  I was uncomfortable the entire time as were my family members.  Twice we mentioned the heat to the waiter, who said he couldn't do anything about it.    Second, while taking our orders the waiter kept up-selling on various side dishes that were not included with the dishes.  He kept telling us to order the \"specials\" which we later, surprisingly found out were about $15-20 more than the other menu items. The waiter never mentioned the price of the specials.   My husbands \"filet special\" consisted of 3 bites of meat and the side of Jumbo prawns consisted of 2 shrimp.  Price: $39.  Give me a break.  Needless to say, he left hungry.  My strip steak was average, at best, and when I ordered it the waiter rolled his eyes as if to say that it was a big mistake not to order the filet instead.  My steak was overcooked and under-seasoned.  The rest of the food got average reviews from my family.   The atmosphere left much to be desired, but, if the food were good it wouldn't have mattered.    In the end, it was very overpriced Italian in a basement and in dire need of AC.    If you go here at all, go in the winter.    It's a shame, but, I won't go back.  For similar prices, exceptional food, and a great dining experience with BYOB, try Cioppinno in the Strip District."}
{"text":"When in the Pittsburgh area, it's important to take the time out of your schedule to view the amazing history that runs throughout the city... one of your stops MUST be La Tavola Italiana!  The good folks at La Tavola have been serving the public for the last thirty years and they don't plan on stopping anytime soon!  An incredible location that overlooks the city itself, they seem to have everything from great food to outstanding service!  The only thing that they don't have here is a liquor license; but feel free to BYOB (they do charge a corking fee).  A quaint and extremely busy family run restaurant, the menu had a variety of different flavors that are sure to make your taste buds explode.  As there was SO much to choose from, we opted to have their Chefs make the choices for us (a trend that we learned about recently in Austin, Texas). While waiting for the food to arrive, we were treated to fresh, warm and crunchy Garlic Bread that was full of garlicky love.  SO delish!  Shortly after ordering, the food began to make its way to the Food Hound's table... and all was right in the world.  The Carmela House Antipasto (named after Chef Carmela) was a generous helping of cold antipasto with fresh mozzarella, artichokes, red peppers and olives that packed in a ton of flavor behavior!  One of my favorites was the Pizza Margherita, made by fifty-year pizza biz veteran - Poppa Giaramita!  First things first, the sauce was BOSS ruling the overall vibe of this pie.  Small and mighty, the pizza was off-the-hook; the light use of basil added a touch of flavor that made my buds go bonkers - soft, tasty and a perfect starter! The Calamari Diavolo (fried calamari) was spicy; but not overbearing - crispy texture while drowning in a red sea of spiced tomato cream with bits of tomato that added a refreshing juicy sweetness that evened out the steady heat.    Already starting to near the 'stuffed' zone - out came the entrees; one bigger than the next!  The Tortellini was stuffed with shrimp and crab; then drowned in a beautiful roasted red pepper cream sauce!  Wow!  Slight spice felt in the rear of your throat; but light, creamy and bursting with tremendous taste - not fishy at all, we savored every bite!  WIN!  The Stuffed Porchetta Milanese was a healthy portion of lightly breaded and fried imported ham, cheese and a simply magnificent light and buttery Milanese sauce; lightly crispy and full of meaty goodness - very recommended.  The Terra Sole was a heaping mound of what would be best described as 'Old School' Italian cooking at its finest!  Another slightly spicy dish, there was a peppery pop in every bite; paired with al dente fuscilli and a hefty portion of sausage that literally falls apart in your mouth... tasty and terrific!  During a visit to our table by the lovely Momma Giaramita (who has been engaging their diners since the grand opening years ago); we were treated to Pop's homemade Meatballs which were uber-yummy!  Baked to perfection using the highest-quality beef; you can taste the hints of garlic, parsley and imported Romano cheese.  As if things couldn't get any better... out comes a sampling of their tremendous desserts!  Everything is made in-house from the sauces, to the breads and right down to the tasty-treats that had been bestowed upon us.  The Dolce Amore was a heavenly chocolate cake that was sweet, delicious and delectable - drizzled with a sweet cream and doused with a flambé of FOUR types of berries (strawberry, blueberry, wildberry and raspberry).  Better known as the dessert of love - it is true to its name.  The Tiramisu was light, creamy and fantasmic; the dried, sprinkled cocoa adds additional greatness to an already perfect finisher... take some home with you!  We had an amazing experience at La Tavola Italiana - everything was so satisfying that we are sure to visit again."}
{"text":"This is my first time back at this restaurant and my wife's first visit.  The special vodka sauce and penne pasta with prosciutto look like it was served in pink dishwater. The place was full of drunks.  NEVER COME HERE! You will get better Italian food at the spaghetti warehouse for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Went here on a slow weeknight. The waiter was very friendly and awesome. BYOB is awesome. I wish I could say the same for the food.  Bread... brought it out, I was late. Tried it. Gross. Brought out a fresh batch so I think... Okay it's fresh so now it will be better. False.   Main dish. I dunno, I expected flavor. It was very blah. I could've easily made it myself, and for a fraction of the price. Maybe I had higher expectations than I should have? Maybe I like things too flavorful? Or maybe they need to step it up."}
{"text":"We rented a private room for an event. There wasn't enough appetizers or salads for everyone and we had to constantly find a server to refill platters. It was almost 90 minutes for them to serve the entrees. The service was less than poor, and the food was average at best. Very disappointed at how they handled the event."}
{"text":"To celebrate my getting a huge promotion at work, my husband Rick took me out to dinner.  He decided to surprise me and while we were still on Carson Street, he told me to close my eyes.  As I felt the car go uphill and take some twists and turns, I assumed we were on Sycamore Street.  I was going nuts.  Was he taking me to some of the restaurants by the Duquesne Incline?  If so, why didn't he simply take the McCardle Roadway up?  Imagine my surprise when he told me I could open my eyes.  He remembered that I like this little cafe.  We began our meal with my favorite, Carmela's Antipasto (Italian lunch meats, roasted red peppers, and cheeses).  We then moved on to the tomato salad.  Since Rick said I could order what I wanted, the steak sounded tempting, but I was in the mood for some good Italian.  My Chicken Cacciatore was absolutely delicious.  My husband however did avail himself of ye olde red meat and ordered the 8oz New York Strip Steak.    And let's face it folks, no Italian meal is complete without some good cannoli or tiramisu.  But which to get?  Aha, order both and share!"}
{"text":"Pizza is always excellent and conversation with the owner Joe is always a pleasure."}
{"text":"We chose La Tavola for my sister's 16th birthday party. There were about 40 people, and La Tavola was able to accommodate us with some planning and a big notice.   We had family style portions of Pasta, bread, and I had the salmon which was very good.  This restaurant is BYOB but there is a fee associated with that service.  Our server was obviously very busy with our table, but really not the friendliest person.  I would be semi inclined to come back on a normal table for two kind of night."}
{"text":"We had dinner here with friends - party of 4 - on Friday 10/31.  We were only able to get reservations at 6:30 as they said they were booked.  We got there and the restaurant was almost empty....and throughout the evening - there were MANY empty tables.  They definitely could have given us a later reservation.   The restaurant is definitely not fancy.  All types of dress would be acceptable.  We were dressed business casual, but there were many there in jeans.  The service was acceptable.  The food was very good and came at appropriate intervals so we did not feel rushed.  I would recommend this restaurant for a casual evening out."}
{"text":"Brought my friend here for her last night in Pittsburgh before she moves. What a great evening we had! Chris was our waiter and he was fantastic. We had a small issue and it was resolved immediately. I highly recommend this establishment. Fantastic food. Calm, intimate atmosphere. The scallops were out of this world. Bravo! Will be back here again."}
{"text":"It's on Mt. Washington, but no view.  The inside looks like a fire hall set up for a wedding.   It is so loud that I sometimes can't hear my dinner partner across the table.  But none of that matters when you taste the food.  The pasta is outstanding, and served in enormous, enormous portions.  The menu is a bit cryptic - dishes aren't really described, only named, so make sure you know what you're getting before you order.    And it's BYOB, so don't forget your wine!"}
{"text":"I was told this place had the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  I'm on a perpetual quest for the best Italian food in Pittsburgh.  It's a noble pursuit.  Right now I believe the best Italian food is at Centro Anni Alla Famiglia.  I walked into this place and thought, \"people who said this was going to be amazing are damn liars!\"  It was not good.  The food was like Del's, and this is not an endorsement.    If you enjoy paying a lot of money for mediocre Italian food you'll be able to tell was once frozen and likely freezer burned, this is the place for you.  Maybe they were having an off day.  I hope so, because I really love good Italian food.  I was just very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I recently gave this place another chance and was disappointed yet again. First of all, we walked in and the restaurant was absolutely empty (we got there right when they opened) and they made a huge stink about us not having a reservation. But then even by the time we left there was only one other couple in the entire restaurant. Ridiculous.   Our service was atrocious. Slow. Inconsistent. She seemed like the didn't really care at all. And we were clearly her only table!  The food is just bland. I don't know how else to describe it. It tastes like there is just no seasoning. Everything is just sub par, especially considering the prices."}
{"text":"Favorite place. Amazing Italian food ! Whatever that chocolate raspberry cake is....I want to eat 7 pounds of it. Byob ...which is Greta to bring friends for a relaxing nice out free of expensive rounds of drinks."}
{"text":"Sorry, Olive Garden, I think when you said, 'when you're here, you're family,' you actually *meant* to say, 'when you're at La Tavola Italiana, you're family,' because seriously, that's what having dinner here is like.  I want to ask, 'why haven't I been here before??' but the answer's pretty simple. This is not what you think of when you think of 'Mt. Washington Restaurants.' It's a low-key sort of place that's on a back street and you'd almost miss it if you weren't looking for it. But inside, it's like you walked into a big family dinner, and all your favorite relatives are there.  When we arrived for our 8:30pm reservations, the dining room was PACKED. There were several giant parties (one of whom turned out to be host to a surprise engagement!), but we were seated right away, and from the moment our server Chris approached our table, I knew we were in for a treat.  While Chris was opening our wines (oh yes, lest I forget to mention, IT'S BYOB!!) we chatted with him about our mutual love for the Food Network. This all began to make sense as soon as he described the night's specials to us. It is a wonderful thing to have a server who is passionate about the food he will be bringing you, and that's exactly what we had with Chris. He described every dish to us in detail as if he was a chef on Chopped and he had just prepared it for the judges.  The decision was tough, but eventually my two dining companions and I settled on our meals. We started with an order of the antipasti - flavorful and fresh, but not so huge a portion that you spoil your appetite - and the fried zucchini. OH that fried zucchini! Crispy, savory, just lightly fried, and accompanied by a wonderful chunky marinara sauce. And at only $8.95, you can't go wrong. Promise me right now that when you come here, you will order the fried zucchini!  We were having a celebratory dinner, so we were taking our time, and Chris really helped that happen. The pacing of the meal was just right: we had enough time to enjoy each course before the next arrived, and there was no pressure to choose our meals too quickly even though the restaurant was crowded.  We enjoyed their crispy, buttery garlic toast alongside our house salads (excellent house Italian salad dressing!) as we waited for our entrees.  Here was where the little snag came in: my girlfriends' meals came out first, and my chicken parm was nowhere in sight. Chris quickly explained that something had gotten mixed up in the kitchen and it would be just a short time. Since we were taking our time chatting and pacing out the meal, it wasn't a problem.  But even though we were in no rush, Chris wasn't satisfied with our having to wait for my plate to come out separately from the others. He not only comped my meal as a courtesy, he treated all three of us to desserts on the house! I realize that mistakes happen in restaurants, especially on busy nights, and I always try to be understanding, but this extra step just meant so much to me. It really showed how important customer service is to this restaurant and its staff and how far they are willing to go to make a mistake right.  Now. About that chicken parm....  Let me just say that it was WELL worth the wait!! I am a little picky about red sauce, but this was off the charts. Hearty and savory and spiced just the right way. Whatever you didn't fit on your fork, you just HAD to dunk your garlic toast in. The breading on the chicken was light, the meat was cooked perfectly so that you barely needed to use a knife to cut the chicken. To be honest, I reeeeeally regretted my decision earlier in the night that I would take half home for my husband to have for dinner!  From start to finish, our dinner at La Tavola Italiana was wonderful. Great service, excellent food, and an atmosphere that made you feel welcome as soon as you walked through the door. I am SO glad my friend insisted we have our celebration dinner here, because I might never have found this place. And now that I have, I know that I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"La Tavola offers some pretty standard Italian food.  Nothing that really stood out, but still a pretty good meal.  The atmosphere inside was the same as just about any Italian restaurant.  A little stuffy, but not so much that it affected our experience.  They are byob which made for a fun experience with the group I went with.  Our servers were very nice and accommodating despite our large party.  For appetizers we had stuffed peppers, calamari, and zucchini.  The zucchini was probably my favorite, however none of the appetizers were very impressive.  For my meal I went with the Strip steak.  I also tried some of my wife's Margarita pizza, which I wish I would have went with.  The pizza had a great texture and flavor.  My steak unfortunately was pretty bad.  When it was brought out I was not asked to cut into it.  If I had been I probably would have sent it back.  However I was starving by the time it got to me so I didn't want to wait.  The meat really lacked any flavor.  Also, the presentation of it was pretty pathetic.  It was just the hunk of meat on a large white plate with nothing else on or around it which did not make it look very appetizing from the start.  Other people did seem to enjoy their meals, especially the lamb however, so maybe I just made a bad choice."}
{"text":"I am gluten intolerant and needed to have my meal gluten free.  They had no more gluten free pasta, and the waitress was clueless as to what was gluten free.  I asked for a plain piece of chicken with marinara sauce.  She brought out my meal..with chicken on top of a plate of spaghetti and told me it was gluten free.  I told her it was not gluten free, and she took it to the kitchen, removed the spaghetti, and brought the same piece of chicken back.  I experienced an allergic reaction as a result of this contamination.  Prior to this, she dumped salad dressing all over my shirt and did not apologize.  I was charged for a full chicken parmigiana meal, when all I got was a plain piece of chicken.  Will not be returning here."}
{"text":"I have been to De Blasio's, Bravo Franco, Alla Famiglia, Arlecchino and Joseph Tambellini to name a few! Me and my Wife enjoy good food! No expert by any means but love the taste of great food! It's an opinion! We arrived early at the start of opening and were the first customers and obviously sat immediately! Our Server was polite, groom and well manner with a pleasant character and knowledge of the establishment. We had an appetizer of Calamari Diavolo which was great in taste but average in tenderness! Don't ask me but I have had Calamari that was tender? But if you weigh price to quality then it is still a gem! Next our meals were Tortelini Crab and shrimp spicy roasted red pepper cream sauce that was a home run! Had personality character that made it special to ME but there was the Pasta Con Frutti Di Mare scallops, shrimp, clam and Calamari that was bland with no personality and what I mean by personality was in a blind fold taste what separates this from other similar meals? THE TRUE SURPRISE was the 1/2 Rack of Lamb which I'm pretty sure isn't their signature meal and not really known for but it was so good I was mad that I didn't get a whole rack! When the server took the bones away I almost cried it was so good! The rosemary and garlic worked to perfection! It was allowed to breath/sweat before serving it to me! It was perfect! Price, character and quality it was a STEAL! It was so good I don't wanna order it again, fearing it was a fluke! Overall this place Rocks! Quality and Price it's a Gem!"}
{"text":"Never a bad experience.  Fresh garlic bread starts every meal.  Specials are great and signature dishes are must try's.  Leave room for desert. And bring some wine."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service was great (we were there on Mother's Day).  $5 corkage fee for each bottle of wine seemed steep."}
{"text":"I dined here with several colleagues earlier this year.  I have little to say other than the service was flat-out fantastic and the food was top-notch.  The owner went out of his way to help us obtain some wine for the table since all the stores were closed (my working assumption is that someone working at the restaurant \"dontated\" it), as well as some very special personal assistance in helping us get back to our hotel when taxi service was unreliable.  The food, wow.  I have not had calamari quite like they did it before or since, and it was fantastic.  I don't remember what I ordered for my main, but do remember not being disappointed.  Our table got quite a sampling of things and everyone was pleased, so I'm not sure you can go too wrong with the Italian fare.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sighhh. A year after a disappointing dinner at the restaurant we had finally convinced ourselves that we should give their Sicilian style pizza a chance.  We ordered a mushroom pie and garlic bread. I wish I could say I loved it and we would order again, but unfortunately not the case.  The crust was greasy and dense but most upsetting, had no flavor. The cheese (as you can see in the picture) had a more plasticy/chewy texture rather than creamy. The garlic bread was dry and oily.   Sorry guys. There are too many other places that we need to try before going back, AGAIN."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic food, amazing pizza, and a family environment! All the yes!!!!!  Best pizza on the mount - just use the side door for your pizza pick up! Stop eating at cestones!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant threw me off a bit. There's no one at the door to tell you where to go so it took us a minute to realize we were suppose to seat ourselves. The bread they give you at the beginning is really good. The side salad was also really good especially with all of the cheese crumbles. We ordered the calamari diavolo and that was very good. My boyfriend ordered the 1/2 rack of lamb and he said it was amazing. I ordered the pasta Carmela. It was good but I wasn't overly impressed. For dessert I ordered the pumpkin tiramisu and again it was good but I wasn't overly impressed. My boyfriend got the dolce amore chocolate cake with berries which was pretty good. Overall it was a nice experience. The waiter was very friendly. It was a little more expensive than we normally spend on a night out but we were on vacation. We would probably stop in again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for my birthday dinner - we are so glad that we did! The chicken Marsala is to die for, the zucchini appetizer is light and flavorful, and anything that's on special is a must try. This restaurant makes any occasion feel like a celebration! Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Oh how I love La Tavola! I have eaten here many times, and it never disappoints. From the outside, it looks like a hole in the wall; but the inside is a cute, quaint, family run establishment. The best part about this place is that it's BYOB!! I usually get the shrimp and crab tortellini. It has the perfect amount of spice in the red pepper cream sauce.  Oh, and the homemade balsamic dressing for the salads is the bomb!  Two small cons: the service isn't very fast. Be prepared to spend at least 2 hours at the restaurant during your visit. At this point, I expect it so I plan accordingly. Also, they will NOT do separate checks. If you go with a group, they won't take more than 4 credit cards for one check- so try to bring cash!  Anyways, La Tavola gets an A+ every time from me!"}
{"text":"I went to La Tavola Italiana last night with a (very cute) date and we had a great time. The waitor was very friendly and liked to joke around, as well as pretended my jokes were funny which I appreciated since I was on a date haha. We started with an order of artichoke hearts and they were very good, the portion was easily enough for both of us to share. For an entree I went with the shrimp scampi and my date the pasta with meatballs, neither of us wanted the included salad and the waitor was more than happy to offer a substitution of italian wedding soup which may have been the best I have ever had, and I have spent half of my life working in and being a patron of my uncles Brooklyn Italian restaurant as well as plenty of family dinners. The shrimp scampi was not prepared how I would have expected, pretty much just sauteed with lemon and a hint of garlic and broccoli on the side and with tails on instead of the traditional preparation over a bed of pasta. I loved the place so it pains me to have to say it was just \"ok\". My dates pasta with meatballs was a large portion with two large meatballs and she loved it, however she has a gutter pallet so I decided to give it a taste for myself and it was excellent. She ate her fill and we still left with at least half of her entree to go.  All in all the place was excellent, the pricing was very fair, the staff very friendly, and the BYOB was the icing on the cake. I highly recommend La Tavola Italiana."}
{"text":"Now that I've eaten at La Tavola I can't believe all the good reviews it got. The calamari was very chewy although the flavor was good. the sauce did not stick to the pasta and the grease used for the veal was not fresh.  The only thing memorable was the rack of lamb. We all agreed it was very good. Service was adequate. Ambiance was terrible."}
{"text":"You are in for an excellent meal at La Tavola. Everything from the wedding soup and calamari to the main dishes were great. It's BYOB, which is a plus in my book, and has a very relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"So many great reviews, so many wonderful comments I have read about this restaurant.  My neighbor personally recommended trying out La Tavola, and so I did.  As with the rest of Mt Washington, parking will either be a pain in the butt or valet.  I arrived at 9:00pm on a Friday night and was lucky enough to find close street parking.    They appeared to have been fairly busy earlier in the day and night, but when I entered about half the tables were empty.  The interior was rather non-descript and I recognized the wall ornamentation from Ross and Marshalls.  We waited for about five minutes before we were seated.  This didn't bother me since all of the servers I saw were moving quick and making rounds to all of their tables and helping each other clean-up.  I was more worried that I would be sat at a table in a corner and lost in that shuffle.  Miraculously, we were sat a two-top in the middle of the entire main dining area.    All of the servers were hustling and bustling and doing what they do and I saw people smiling and laughing with the exception of one that was just talking to one of his tables.  After 15 minutes of waiting and not seeing anyone, I did start to get a tad irritated.  I wondered if the only server that was talking with one of his tables rather than serving or helping the other servers was our server.  I started to stare in his direction and he looked at me a couple of times before something in his head clicked.  He came over and asked if we had been served and I told him no.  He left, returned in a few minutes and apologized.  He was our server.  As we had been waiting for 20 minutes, we new EVERYTHING that we wanted and ordered:  Pepsi Tea with Lemon Meatballs as an appetizer Wedding Soup (in place of salad) Veal Piccata (no mushrooms) with a side of potatoes  Veal Parmagiana with linguine and red sauce  Our server seemed perturbed that we already knew what we wanted and didn't want to listen to the specials.  Not only did he have a poor attitude from his first contact, but he didn't write anything down.  I didn't order any additional appetizers due to those two facts.  Our server promptly disappeared and we didn't see him for another ten minutes.  I saw every other server in the place several times.  Some of them even stopped to help us and bring bread -- they were all very nice people.  We finally received our drinks -- a Pepsi for my friend and I.  I asked the server if I could have the tea I ordered. He apologized and said he didn't know how he could have forgotten since he had commented earlier on how the kitchen had just brewed a fresh batch.  And then the waiting started anew.  Our server didn't visit our table again for the next thirty minutes.  He would disappear.  He would stop and chat with other tables.  He would stand around and look as all of the other servers were running around, serving, and also helping to clean our server's tables.  He never helped with anyone else.  Thankfully the other servers refilled our drinks and brought bread to us.  We even managed to get the wedding soup from one of the other servers.  It was good.  It had more of a spinach flavor than many other Wedding soups I have eaten, but it was good.  Alas, we never saw our meatballs.  Our food finally arrived.  The serving sizes were a wonderful size.  I was really not liking our server; but that was fine since I had been craving a good piccata for some time.  I wasn't even perturbed by the fact that I had broccoli instead of the potatoes the server stated came with my meal.  As I dug in, I was left in dismay.  The piccata didn't taste of lemon, capers, or wine in any way.  It tasted like a heavy, flour gravy.  To top it off my food wasn't hot, but tepid or lukewarm.  I tried some of my friends veal parmagiana.  I then went to try some of his linguine to find that it was spaghetti.  I didn't hate it, but the red sauce had a weird aftertaste akin to the metallic aftertaste I get from artificial sweeteners.  I finished my food.  I saw several dessert trays being sent to a larger party in the room next door, and the desserts looked good.  I was by no means full and could have eaten more; but I just didn't want to have to deal with this server anymore.  I can't help but wonder if Rachel C. had the same server I had.    So why I haven't I given 1 star?  A 1 star would mean that I would most likely never return, my friend didn't hate his food and I know that piccata is a difficult dish to make.  I think my experience was greatly colored by one of the worst servers I have ever had.  I will return at some point and make certain to try a different food and to get a different server."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't go to Italian restaurants.  My Italian grandmother lived to be 102 years old, and she taught me everything I know about cooking Italian food, so I am almost ALWAYS disappointed when I end up ordering from somebody's menu.  No brag, just fact... I am a great Italian cook, even though I don't look like one...  So, it was with some trepidation that I accepted an invitation from my dining partner to check out one of her favorite places to go with the bigshots from work.  I knew I'd be disappointed.  Ooops... Guess what happened?  Yes, I loved it.    I loved it so much that I came back to explore the menu further.  And then I came back AGAIN to try what I had almost ordered the second time!  And NOW?  Well, NOW I'm actually signed up for a very pricey cooking class in the downstairs kitchen studio at La Tavola, hosted by a remarkable matron of the kitchen, Carmella.  Yes, I'm pretty serious about Italian cooking, and after three wonderful meals enjoyed by me, my partner, and some friends, I decided that the opportunity to learn from this lady was too good to pass up.  I can hardly wait - and of course, I selected a date when she is teaching a veal dish.  In fact, FIVE of us are attending Carmella's cooking class, and one of us has signed up for a second class already.    I plan to bring a nice primitivo, and one of my friends is bringing a couple of bottles of fine chianti, because La Tavola is BYOB.  I think they actually get around liquor law somewhat with their dessert menu, which features some high powered rum cake and limoncello sorbet.  From beginning to end, I have enjoyed every bite of everything I have sampled at this place since being turned on to it.  And we SHARE, so every time I've been there, I and my friends have ordered different dishes so we could have a broader sampling of the menu.  The menu is very interesting.  It's a composite of tried-and-tested simplicity and creative genius for the more adventurous.  The dishes are very accurately described, and there is a lot to choose from, so bring your reading glasses and be prepared to waffle back and forth on your selection.  The atmosphere of the place is SO VERY throwback.  It feels like New York City in the 60s or early 70s.  Honestly, if you were just driving around the neighborhood looking for a less expensive Mount Washington restaurant that DIDN'T have a view, you would probably drive right by this place.  But, in a fond memories of my Italian grandmother kind of way, it's VERY charming.  There is plenty of seating, and if you don't come early, you ARE going to wait.  Good things are worth waiting for, but my advice is to COME EARLY before they get slammed.  By the way, there's a REASON they get slammed, and it's NOT the decor or the view.  I was very surprised to see any negative reviews of this place, and I have a few tips for you: 1. Don't trust a review of Italian food by someone who doesn't know how to spell \"lasagna.\"  The lasagna at La Tavola is excellent, but some people are used to Stouffer's, and their opinions don't count. 2. Don't trust reviews from impatient reviewers who were unhappy with their experience because they had to wait too long for the food.  There's a REASON you had to wait too long.  People love this place, and they come back often, and sometimes really good food takes time to prepare, unlike the microwave crap that you are accustomed to.  By the way, REAL Italian families can spend HOURS at the dinner table when they gather. 3. Don't trust reviewers who complain about getting \"too much food\" at an Italian restaurant.  Skinny jeans people have no place at a real Italian table, unless they don't mind finishing their meal over the course of several days, which apparently SOME people have a problem with. 4. Don't trust reviews by people who claim to be Italians that expect EVERY dish to be over-garliced, over-spiced, and over-priced.  If they don't understand the SUBTLETIES of real Italian cooking, then they probably don't cook for themselves and have been duped by the HIPSTER purveyors of pseudo-Italian bastardizations.  If you want AUTHENTIC, then don't complain when AUTHENTIC doesn't tickle your burned out palate. 5. Don't trust reviews of Italian food that are written by people who live in places like Utah, and who complain about the food being \"blah\" or claim that they could have made it cheaper themselves at home.  Really?  Subtlety in Italian cooking is authentic.  Simplicity in Italian cooking is authentic.  Rant concluded.  Now, if you want me to repeat this in my NEW YORK ITALIAN kind of way, I'm going to require the use of my hands and a few expletives. CAPICHE?"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you don't notice while driving by.  We stumbled upon it while looking for a more affordable dining option for a Friday night around Mt. Washington.  I had the Terra Sole, which tasted fresh and delicious, but did not have a particular \"wow\" factor.  I would say the food is mid-range as is the prices.  The service is great and friendly though.  Parking is available in a lot on the side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love love love. Never had a bad meal here. I also love that is byob- pick the bottle and bring it. On Valentine's Day they usually have a prefixed menu. Still good. Very cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"After a bad experience at TGI Fridays, my boyfriend and I decided to check out more local restaurants to support local business as well as open up our taste buds to things other than chain restaurants. Having family in Mt. Washington, I pass it occasionally so it's always been a place I've wanted to try. This was our first stop...  The food was excellent and a great start to more of a finer dining experience. It's fancy, but not suit-and-tie fancy, so if you want to come in a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt - you're good. The food was great! We ordered the Pasta Carmela and it was enough to take home. The garlic sauce was light yet satisfying and had a zing of spice which perfected the meal. We also were served garlic bread and a salad with a wonderful house dressing that reminded me of an Italian/Balsamic mix. Also note that the place is BYOB. Enough said... The place itself sort of crammed which was one of the only downfalls, but overall the experience was pleasant. Service is great, too. I definitely would like to come back and allow others to experience this gem."}
{"text":"The food here was really tasty - I had the shrimp and crab tortellini. However, the service was super slow."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. It got one star because of the wine and I brought my own. Never have I ever experienced terrible service like this. Our server Katie was \"annoyed\" to open our wine, take our order and had a terrible attitude. our reservation was at 8:15....oh we are still here waiting for food! Pathetic."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for 6 years on our anniversary. This place has a special place in our hearts... This past anniversary we came here twice. The first time was for a regular dinner. The second was for a cooking class. Now, the four stars is not for the food or service, as both are and have been on point with great service and tasty dishes. It is for the draft from the cold outdoors the last time we were here. After even asking them to close the door, they opened it back up just a few moments later. I needed a hot coffee, pronto! .. But the pasta is always fresh. The meats and herbs are all fresh and cooked just right! The class we took was a bit pricey, but we were very entertained and the portions were generous. Even the regular dinner dishes are so big you will definitely have lunch for the next day! The BYOB is always my favorite anywhere I go. Over all a huge thumbs up! Just make a reservation prior and make sure it's not by the door!  P.S. They accommodate big parties and make it very comfortable for them!"}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday for my friends 30th birthday party with a group of 12. We had a reservation and wow am I glad we did! I saw them have to turn down multiple families due to being full/reservations. So make sure you make one! We were seated immediately and our server was so friendly. (So sorry I forget his name!)  He thoroughly went through the appetizers and we had the stuffed peppers, zucchini planks and eggplant parm. All were tasty!  For my meal I went with the margarita pizza. It was thin crust and crisp. It was good, not the best I have had but good. Two of my friends had pasta dishes and they were amazing!! So jealous I did not get pasta. One had the gnocchi which had banana peppers and sausage in the sauce. It was the perfect spice. The other had a penne in vodka sauce. I honestly do not even love vodka sauce but this one had such a good strong flavor, I loved it.   The meal did take about 2 hours because it was so crowded, but that's ok because we were celebrating! Overall a nice Italian place!"}
{"text":"Went there for the feast of 7 fishes and it was excellent!!!! Love the atmosphere of it being a family run restaurant, the whole staff was happy and attentive. It is BYOB which is nice. I would definitely go there again and recommend it to othere."}
{"text":"The phrase \"Do not judge a book by its cover\" usually carries the same implication when used.  In this case it's turned around. It is a nice quaint restaurant burrowed in Mt Washington. Nice people as well.  You go there because you might be tired of the bar food or do not want to pay the for the over priced plates on Grandview. The place itself has character and not a bad environment to enjoy a meal. Then comes the meal. My referred to the Nonas pizza as a \"sheet of croutons, a can of hunts spaghetti sauce and Kraft parmesan sprinkled over the top. I have only been there twice, yet not impressed. The plain cheese pizza is no better than little ceasers. I'll give it one more go considering the atmosphere of a nice place and good people."}
{"text":"good food and byob only bad thing was hostess was rude"}
{"text":"Amazing service! The waiter gave great recommendations and made us feel right at home. We ordered the Calamari Fritta as an appetizer and it was incredible. The calamari was tender with a light, crispy, and slightly spicy crust.  For dinner, I ordered a full rack of lamb (8 ribs) which had plenty to share. The meat was perfectly medium rare and very tender. For dessert, we had cannoli, limoncello sorbet, and chocolate cake with a berry reduction, all of which were delicious. The bill was very reasonable considering how much we ordered. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying that I am a real wine snob and foodie and love good food and eat out a lot......La Tavola was referred to me by a friend who has gone their with large groups which they have accommodated. My girlfriend and I went last evening and I love Italian and really wanted to like this place a lot to add it to a list of good Italian restaurants. Unfortunately it came up very short. It was a Tuesday evening and rather empty and we sat at a table in a large non descript room. Truly no ambiance. We had brought a bottle of Decoy Cabernet (five dollar corkage fee....BYOB) The waitress was nice enough but did not explain the specials as we overheard them shared by another waiter at another table and we were like, Hmm...we didn't even know these were offered. She uncorked our wine, poured us some water and brought us some garlic bread which was honestly the best dish of the evening.   We had the calamari which had been described as \"the best ever\". It was not. It was okay. My girlfriend had the Pasta Carmella house special and I the Veal Piccatta. The Pasta Carmella was so over seasoned with red pepper and banana peppers as to be almost uneatable. You could literally taste nothing as your mouth was on fire the entire time. As we shared it we kept picking out the banana peppers in a vain attempt to cool it down.  I had the veal which was okay but over lemoned. You should not be able to taste the lemon to the degree that I was able.   All in all just okay. No need to rush back......Easy parking, Fair, not cheap prices."}
{"text":"We had heard great things about La Tavola and had heard it compared with some of our other favorite Italian places in the city so we were excited to book a reservation for Feb 15th.  I called and left a message three weeks ago. No one responded. I called back and spoke to someone - made the reservation for Feb. 15th. We showed up last night and it was crowded - we weren't impressed when we walked it but we were still hoping the food would be delicious.  Alas, we never got the chance because when were finally seated, we were given a \"special Valentine's Menu\" - there was NOTHING on the menu we wanted - it was all lamb chops, veal, lobster, etc. - and the prices were way off from what we'd seen when we saw the online menu. There were no traditional Italian dishes.  We waited about 15 minutes before someone came to our table because we wanted to confirm we couldn't get the regular menu. The waiter confirmed it and said we should have been told when we made the reservation.  We walked out - NEVER willing to give it another shot.  Any place that serves an overpriced special menu the day after Valentine's Day and doesn't offer any menu basics and doesn't notify someone when they make a reservation 3 weeks in advance is not some place we are willing to give another try. Luckily we snagged some bar seats in a local South Side Italian spot and had a great meal."}
{"text":"LTI is a place families and friends go to have a celebration.  There were 4 or 5 tables of 10 or 12 that were celebrating Birthdays, so it was fun to get to sing along.  We went with a small group to celebrate too. It is a little on the noisy side so if you are a small group try to get the smaller side dining area.   It is BYOB!  It is $5 per bottle you open, so bring a big bottle. LOL Actually a reasonable price even if you have a screw top bottle.  If you are in a hurry this is not the place for you.   It has been years since I have been to LTI due to my last experience with a waiter but that is long gone.  Our waitress was good and had help delivering our food and picking up our dirty plates.  Of course you have to share a couple of appetizers.  The beans and greens are you standard fare; nothing special but what you would expect.  The Calamari Frutti was very good.   For the main course I had the Tortelini with Crab and Shrimp with a spicy roasted red pepper cream sauce was a very good choice with enough left over for a good lunch.  For desert we were in the share mode and had a very good Cannoli and some really good spumoni covered in a chocolate crust. So if you are in the mode for a nice dinner and/or having a celebration this is a good choice."}
{"text":"I am going to take this down from 5 to 4 stars because it has been uneven as of late. Sometimes service is a bit slower or the food isn't quite as good, but this is till a very good place to dine."}
{"text":"Fun local neighborhood place to go. Old school Italian! Friendly staff with character!! Great pasta and fish special!  Italian wedding soup super per my 11 yr old. BYOB great too!"}
{"text":"This is a local joint that is family owned and run. Great food and people.  The pizza sauce has a little spice to it and is really good. The pizza is square cut.  I've primarily eaten the pizza so I can't comment much on the other parts of the menu.   Keep in mind this is not a high end joint.  It is a local family pizza joint, so if you are looking for some fancy italian joint...not the place for you.  Worth the time if your on The Mount looking for some local food."}
{"text":"Two stars because the food was pretty good. We got an order of the calamari diavolo based on the waiter's recommendation. It was slightly more chewy than it should have been, but it had good flavor. For our entrees we got the special (scallops) and the shrimp and crab tortellini. Both of these were very tasty. The garlic bread was also fresh and piping hot which was good becaussseee...  Our salads were completely forgotten about. The waiter raved about the dressing, then they never came. Then our entrees took an extremely long time to arrive. Originally we were asked where we would like to sit, we told them it didn't matter, so he put us in the corner- which was fine. But from then on it was like that corner did not exist. For a \"white table cloth\" dining experience, the service definitely left a lot to be desired.  And it was absolutely freezing in there. Like, teeth chattering cold.  I was excited to order a cannoli for dessert because they are my favorite, but I was so frustrated by the end of the dinner that we decided to leave.   Get takeout, I guess."}
{"text":"I wish that I could give La Tavola five stars because the first couple experiences I had were amazing, but my last visit was pretty rough.  I finally brought my boyfriend to the restaurant because I had been raving about it for a while from times I had gone with my friends.  I had also done the feast of the seven fishes dinner around Christmas time, and it is still one of my favorite dining memories! However, this last time, it took almost a half an hour for anyone to come over to our table because they must have had some kind of miscommunication about who our server was?  But it felt a little odd because several staff members had looked over at our table, but none of them came over to check on us.  Also, it took a pretty long time to get our food...I'm sure restaurants have their bad days though.  Anyways, the food was still delicious, so the visit wasn't all bad, and I will still probably dine with them again."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Walked in to an empty house with only a few guest. Quickly seated and treated by a really nice waiter. He was well versed on the menu options, some of which weren't listed on the menu.  The bread the bring to the table is garlicky and super delicious. Our food was just as delicious as it sounded on the menu. My chicken was perfectly cooked with generous portion of cheeses. It was perfectly spiced with a nice crunchy outer crust. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is off the beaten path of Mt Washington restaurants, located in a neighborhood that could use sprucing up. There is a small parking lot on the side of the building. It's a spacious restaurant with two tops and four tops and even a few tables set up for larger parties and family style seating. Standard Italian flare starts things off, a waiter comes to the table and announced all the specials, which on this night they featured a pork loin and a shrimp dish. Neither sounded appealing since I had my heart set on one of their standard dishes, chicken Jolene, this is a huge chicken breast wrapped with eggplant lightly sauteed then finished in the oven. A butter/lemon/garlic sauce finishes this excellent dish. For my pasta course I had vodka sauce over imported penne, which was excellent. My appetizer was a peasant dish called greens and beans. You can't get more Italian than this dish, collards and white beans sauteed in extra virgin olive oil with sausage and garlic and lots of fresh bread to soak up the juices. It's BYOB for wine, bring a good red wine with you. Next time I come I want to try the pasta with bacon and peas, that sounds great."}
{"text":"First time that I have had Eggplant Parm that was not breaded and fried. Incredibly delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to La Tavola's many times. It's right up the street from my house. I highly recommend when making reservation to as for John as your server. He is very professional and knows the menu. Plus takes very good care of you. The food here is amazing. If your coming for your first time I recommend going on a week night. It gets very busy on the weekend and sometimes the food and service wasn't as good as it should have been. Their calamari di ablo is the best I've ever had!!! And if you like rack of lamb theirs is to die for!"}
{"text":"We ate here in July and although I am a fan of the food-I think this place runs a bit of a scam...  From what I can tell, they basically sell wine, although they claim to have someone run down the street or what have you.  So you pay them and tip them but no real running down the street ever happens.  I bet they have boxes of it back there.  That said, it's still probably cheaper than buying it.  The service here I would describe as mixed.  We went on a night when it was DEAD.  It was just us and a few other people finishing up.  It was a Weds and it must have been about 9pm when we were seated.  I can't recall our servers name after all that time, but he was a bit of a know it all.  If you get this guy you will know it...he will basically \"suggest\" this and that...but these aren't suggestions, he will probably poison you if you don't follow them.  I am only half joking.  He \"suggested\" only the most expensive stuff on the menu-but for me it was all good.  It was a great meal with a good friend I rarely see, but it was a little intimidating.  I actually think this guy deserves a good beating...god knows how many people he has done this to.  The pastas, the apps and the entrees were all, for me, solid to excellent.  If it was just on the food I would give them 5 stars, but the guy was a total ass...and I wouldn't eat here again.  I would rather eat at an ok restaurant (food wise) with great service than the opposite.  Our check was pretty steap, which is ok and we tipped Mr. recommendation well, but I can't endorse the place because of this.  Don't get me wrong-it was good enough to overlook the service as long as you can ensure you don't get this guy.  I don't know how to do that though, and I don't like being strong armed by anyone...least of all by some guy who brings me my food and is supposed to let ME decide.  Capiche?"}
{"text":"We were seated in the basement \"lounge\" which has a drastically different vibe in comparison to the upstairs which is loud and crowded. The best thing about this restaurant was that it was BYOB, the servings were large, and the eggplant appetizer was really tasty. The restaurant would otherwise receive 4 stars but most of my party's entrees were SPICY. The stuffed peppers felt like biting into a jalepeño! Mine had a Bolognese sauce which also had a kick that I couldn't  even get through half. The only dish that wasn't spice was the seafood pasta dish but it only had 3 mussels in it, a real let down."}
{"text":"Excellent food and personalizd service. We were treated like old friends although the first time there. Tucked away on Mt Washington. Highly recommend.  BYOB with a corking fee."}
{"text":"Food has been tasty here in the past. Then, this evening we were so disappointed. The calamari appetizer tasted like it was frozen not fresh;  the carbonara was dry, too many onions, could hardly taste or see the pancetta; my husband's penne vodka (the special) was watery, not creamy, and required lots of Parmesan cheese to bring out what little flavor that was there at all. Sometimes, restaurants experience a challenging evening. This evening there were few customers to be concerned about.  Perhaps the chef was having a bad night. I understand that happens.   I am always interested in giving them another chance. However, after we drove one hour back home, and discovered we left our wine bag and two bottles of wine under the table we called the restaurant to ask them to put it aside for us. They said they looked under the table and could not find it. The manager and the assistant who answered the phone acted like they didn't even care and we were a nuisance to be calling and asking for them to check on the whereabouts of our wine. We gave them a second chance by calling again ten minutes later just to see if they had found it. I received the same apathetic attitude. The manager seemed annoyed that I was calling again. I was ready to give the chef another chance, however with the manager and wait staff expressing such a poor attitude, i will take my business elsewhere. And when i compare notes  with my downtown friends about Italiani will share the story."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh... and possibly in the entire Commonwealth of Pennsylvania! Each time I've been there I have tried a different dish and swear that each one is superior to the last. During my last visit to eat at Joe and Carmella's place I had the Chicken Romana, which for now is my favorite thing I've ever ordered there. I've tried Chicken Romana at other places since having theirs in January 2012, but just cannot match the deliciousness. If you're anywhere near Pittsburgh you should get in your car, pick up a bunch of your friends, pick up your enemies (because they won't be your enemies for long after you take 'em there), and head to Mount Worshington/Washington. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh this place!  I wanted to like it, I really did! I had heard good things from a few friends.  I also felt guilty I hadn't been there since I lived so close to it!  Me and a group of friend went there.  At the very beginning of the meal they pretty much tell you service will be VERY slow.  They weren't kidding! I assume that maybe just meant a long wait for food.  It wasn't just food we waited for though!  We waited for drinks, bread an even silverware!  The server was no where to be found at times.  I would have forgiven all this if my food was amazing BUT it was far from it!  I'm very judgmental of Italian being that I am a proud Italian myself!  I ordered past vodka.  It was not the creamy delish sauce I expected, it was runny tastelessness!  My friend tried the regular spaghetti and the sauce tasted like it was from a spaghetti-o can.  Everyone agreed their meals left much to be desired.  Again, I really wanted to like this place, but after a 3 1/2 hour overpriced unappetizing meal I could no longer like the place!"}
{"text":"BYOB..to me this typically translates to \"Hey we are awesome, so yeah feel free to have a great evening by bringing your own good time in una bottle.\"   And yeah...it always does. It just so happens that near the summit of Mt. Washington sits a little Italian place known as La Tavola Italiana that is nestled in despite the blistering winds that the Mountain may bring.   Inside you will find plenty of seating in your typical Italian dinner spot (Excluding violent backroom interrogations and the occasional horse head.)  When the waiter went over the menu I have to say he was not speak Italian simply because I am always in search of a truly Italian experience. That being said, he attempted so I give him a solid \"A\" for sforzo.  I chose some mushroom dish as an appetizer but lets be honest..I ordered a giant mushroom. It was really good though, no complaints on the giant mushroom. (When you are at an Italian restaurant, one must always ask themselves, What would Mario do.)   The dinner for me was Calamari in pasta. It was delicious. It if weren't for my body rejecting it during a soccer game later that evening I have to say I may even be raving about it even more. And yes..Mario would have played soccer for all those nay sayers out there.  All in all, great service, great food with wine to boot. Definitely will consider coming back. On that note...   It was eccellente!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!!! Very authentic, and the family that owns it is extremely nice and welcoming. The staff are all very knowledgeable about the menu, and very sweet. They do not rush you through the meal. One time they messed up my order (mistakes happen!), and brought me a whole extra plate of pasta and did not charge me. Carmela's cooking classes are also AWESOME and so much fun. I would definitely recommend it as a date night, or night out with some friends. The BYOB aspect is great also. I have gotten the chicken piccata, pasta carbonara, carmela's pasta, and many others and they've all been fantastic. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Boy took me to La Tavola on a Saturday evening. The very nice valet moved our car approximately four feet. I found this a bit strange, but moving on.  La Tavola has a casual and busy feel to it. We made reservations for 8:30 pm and arrived about ten minutes early. The hostess seated us promptly. The restaurant was packed with large groups of people, may of whom brought bottles of wine and even coolers of beer to share. I don't mind BYOB. I like that I can bring my wine of choice. It avoids restaurant markups of alcohol. That being said, La Tavola's corking fees are reasonable.   We started our meal with the fried ravioli appetizer (very good) and salads. My salad was overloaded with gorgonzola, which makes it the first time while dining that I had ever wished for less cheese. The bread baskets are actually garlic bread baskets. Keep this in mind and bring mints for later.  Our server was one of the best waiters I have ever had.  He was cognizant of all of our needs and had a friendly personality. The menu is rather extensive, with a long list of pasta and meat entrees. I was in the mood for lasagna, and our waiter gave me a very honest and descriptive answer when I queried about it. (In a nutshell, \"avoid,  La Tavola has better things to offer.\") I always respect staff that know the strengths and weaknesses of a business. I chose the \"Terra Sole\", which was fuscilli with sausage and roasted red peppers in a tomato cream sauce. This was delicious, but less creamy than I expected. Probably more healthy, anyway.  Boy chose the \"Pasta Carmela\" which is spicy linguine with a choice of meat. He thought this was \"ok\".  A veteran diner at La Tavola, boy has decided to avoid this dish in the future.   Overall, a good (not great) dining experience. Prices are reasonable. A few notes. If you are looking for an intimate Italian dinner, go someplace else.  La Tavola gets very crowded (read: noisy) and I found myself constantly asking boy to repeat himself. On the other hand, if you are looking for hearty portions and friendly service, head to 1 Boggs Ave."}
{"text":"After living in Mount Washington for two and a half years, I finally decided to take a trip to La Tavola with my wife and my sister in law.  We all love Italian, so initially, I was excited to be visiting for the first time.  When we arrived at 5pm on Friday evening, the hostess said that it was impossible to get a seat on the weekends and that we should've made a reservation if we wanted to eat there on a Friday.  I apologized for not doing so, and she said that she would see what she could do for us.  She looked at a piece of paper and decided to find us a spot. Please keep in mind, however, that the restaurant had not a soul in it.  As a side note, there were still only three people in the restaurant when we left at 6pm, so I'm not sure why the runaround was necessary.  Any-who, my sister in law and myself ordered the chicken parmigiana.  The chicken was so-so, and a bit over fried, but it's hard to mess up fried chicken.  However, the spaghetti sauce had little to no taste, very bland, and it had chunky tomatoes in it, which I'm not a fan of.  I could've looked past the chunky tomatoes if the sauce had any flavor to it.  I ended up spending about $90, and left very disappointed and underwhelmed.  The server also was hard to find being they we were the only party in the store. I don't think I'll be going back again, and I can't recommend this establishment to anyone else."}
{"text":"Not a family / kid friendly place. Food was bland and service was horrible. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"A favorite amongst my girlfriends and family. Fantastic authentic made from scratch menu in an intimate location. Excellent service. Feel like family while dining. Unpretentious. Owners are a delight. It's a neighborhood secret. An absolute delight. One that shows its value and quality by withstanding the test of time.   I am obsessed with their Parmesan style dishes and tortellini. I have trouble deciding between the Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan. Not a lot of places do Eggplant right, so when you do find it house made done correctly it's a must.   And then there is the Tortellini in the red pepper sauce. Oh. My. Goodness. Wow. I could drink the sauce. If they served it up in a wine glass, I'd shamelessly indulge. It's THAT good.   Friends and family have said their rack of lamb and half rack are a must order. (I'm not a lamb eater)   I can say that I don't even like Chicken Masala but I do like theirs. That's saying something!   The real treat is what's going on beyond the dining room. Cooking classes and tasting dining. My friends have been taking the cooking classes. I am so thankful. Now our friends are bringing cooking techniques home with them and inviting us to dine at their homes & sharing! With the way it's benefited them, I can't wait to find some time to take a class!"}
