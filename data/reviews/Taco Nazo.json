{"text":"Rice, great! green chile, great! Bacon breakfast burrito with cheese, great! Will return."}
{"text":"I go there whenever I am on that side of town.  Always good food, reasonable prices, nice staff.  I really like there burritos, tacos de asada,  There hot sauce is really good not sure its house made or commercial but really good."}
{"text":"I don't eat Mexican food often, but when I do or I want to take someone who loves Mexican food out, I find my way to Taco Nazo, they have a great menu, lots of choices, You can always find something You like, my favorites the tacos with extra guac, the Burritos are good as well but everything is good. The prices are more than reasonable for what You get and service is quick and efficient, a really good choice if You like an authentic mexican food experience."}
{"text":"This is that place next to the REI off of Southern Avenue. No real ambiance or service to speak of - it's just a little strip mall burrito joint.  I ordered the Devil's Shrimp burrito or burro or something, I don't know. I don't guess I stopped to think about what meaning exactly the word 'devil' might carry in the name, but I found out - it means HOT. Like hotter than pepper spray hot. And yes, unfortunately for me, I do know what pepper spray tastes like - I had this friend in college back in Austin, and one drunken night his crazy little brother Michael slipped me a shrimp that he'd soaked in pepper spray. Lemme tell ya, that was pretty F'in hot, but not even close to the devil shrimp at Taco Nazo. I'll be back, but only to take Michael there when he comes to visit next month. Beware the devil's shrimp."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office, decided to go for lunch today with my fiancé and didn't have that great of service. We both ordered a sopes comb plate, I had asked for double rice rather than the rice and beans. Instead he charged us for two extra sides of rice and also gave me the rice and beans that came with our comb. When we received our order I brought it to his attention that I didn't want two extra rice just substitute the beans . He took it to his cook and told him in Spanish that's not what I wanted, cook in Spanish said \"if I have to remake anything, I will take long on this\". I brought it to his attention that I heard and understood so to just give me the plate how it was and refund me the two extra rice he charged. I was on my lunch break , never apologized or even made eye contact when speaking just looked annoyed with us. Food was okay, most likely wont come back even if its close to my work office."}
{"text":"Best Effing Mexican Food I've ever had. I had to stop after every bite I took and had to thank the Lord for this place. I'm definitely inviting my friends to come eat here. I found heaven on earth here at Taco Nazo. Dayum!!! Phew!!!"}
{"text":"I had shredded beef soft tacos. Food is full of flavor and the watermelon water is so good on a hot day. Good place to get good mexican food. Two more meals and i will give this place 5 stars. Taco Nazo in the building!"}
{"text":"There is an overly crowded menu and so with that many choices you can order.  The drinks are extra and they charge for refills unless its from a separate combo menu.  The service is quick, but not outstanding or friendly.  The cheese enchilada plate I had not hot, cheesy, or gooey as I would have expected.  There is a very small condiment section for salsa limes and carrots n jalapeños.  It was not enough bang for my buck!"}
{"text":"very bad service. muy mal servicio.  The lady taking orders has no idea what customer service is."}
{"text":"I work pretty close to this place so sometimes I'll stop for lunch. I've only had their California burrito but I can say that it was pretty damn tasty, not overly greasy and not so huge that I felt like crap after eating the whole thing. Works for me!"}
{"text":"I had the chili rellanos. They came in a swimming fajitas soup. It was really weird but edible, but that being said, i eat anything!  I managed about half of my food. as it left a weird after taste in my mouth (bad cooking oil?) Hubby ate even less of his.  Service was quick as my hubby ordered it to go and was at my office in a snap.  2 stars because it was quick and I liked the rice. Recommendations: If you are in need of some Mexican rice quickly this is a great spot"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall that I have eaten at. The service is mediocre but the taco's are A Plus!!!!!"}
{"text":"At best this is mediocre food, the hot sauces were not, the chili rellano was a rice filled burrito with one strip of chile and no rellano. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Great lunch!  Ordered our food ahead of time and it was ready when we got there.  I ordered the 3 chicken rolled tacos with rice and beans (combination special).  The tacos were crispy/crunchy and loaded with fresh lettuce, pico, cheese and guac.  The beans and rice were excellent as well as their spicy salsa.  Delicious and hit the spot.  The service was also very friendly and the to go order was packaged nicely.  They have a nice selection on their menu and I look forward to trying other items.  Definitely recommend if you want yummy, quick, inexpensive and delicious Mexican food!  Yum! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good selection of Mexican dishes. I being the vegetarian that I am always have to look for creative ways to put a meal together. The staff at the restaurant was very helpful and I didn't feel the usual rudeness that comes with taking an order from a vegetarian (I'm sure my veggie friends agree). I ordered a bean and rice burrito and it was awesome. I would come back and try their breakfast burrito some day, my friend ordered it and it looked delicious :) the chips and salsa were also great and the salsa tasted fresh and home made. I would say that the TV was quite loud while I was there but that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick meal. I prefer just a bean burrito and this hits the spot. The service is fast and my burrito was yummy!"}
{"text":"Food is very good. I definitely recommend this place to anyone that like Mexican good especially tacos and seafood."}
{"text":"Ok the worst Mexican food I've ever had. I've had food truck food better than this. The rice was bland, the enchiladas bland, and the beans seem like they came from a can. It's like something as simple as salt isn't even used! The first enchiladas I ever made tasted better than that. Trust me when I tell you my enchiladas tasted \"American\". The chicken was awful and looked strange. The prices were unbelievable. Way too expensive especially for the quality. On the subject of their decorations it just looks tasteless. The paintings are random. There are way too many soccer posters. The cardboard cut outs towards the front make it seem like it's a Mexican amusement park. Anyway I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. They obviously don't try to improve the quality of food. The service was friendly and the food came out quickly, which unfortunately is the only nice thing I could say."}
{"text":"Small plastic fork. Let's start there. I had the fish tacos and they were edible only because I was starving. Poor excuse for salsa bar. Service was ok served with a smile at least but all in all food was horrid. At least it is hard to mess up Horchata :)   Rivas or Filly B's next time I need a quick Mexican dive fix for lunch or very early AM snack."}
{"text":"If you read the reviews you'll see that people love this place. it is a dive, but the tacos are great. Lots of options and cheap. Been there many times and never been disapointed."}
{"text":"Awesome POZOLE, if you don't try the pozole you were dropped on your head as an infant! Make sure to order s side of bread for dipping into this amazing pozole juice! If you can't handle the heat don't use the hot sauce, if you are a CHAMP go ham on the hot sauce! 4 stars bishes!"}
{"text":"Greasy, slow, expensive, unfriendly, and bland. I could think of more buzzwords, but that about sums it up. $10 and change for an unseasoned, greasy, meat-sweat inducing burrito with soupy gray beans, orange rice, and a drink. No salsa bar to speak of. Almost $2 for a small fountain drink and no free refills (not just on the Horchata/Jamaica variety but soft drinks as well). Terrible segmented Styrofoam plates, single ply napkins, and bendy silverware complete the experience.  I guess they have to cut corners evrrywhere else to afford their 70-inch TV that lights up their dining area better than fluorescent lighting. There are cheaper, better restaurants that actually care about what they're doing that would love your money."}
{"text":"I ordered chile rellenos and beans and what I got was chile relleno soup and watered down beans.  you could literally drink the chile rellenos.  worst worst WORST mex in all the valley."}
{"text":"Close by work and has decent prices. I've got the special pork skin tacos the two times I've been here and I've liked them.  I've had better but the convenience will probably have me coming back and changing up my order."}
{"text":"I guess the one star review are for folk who had their burritos and plates and left hungry.  That was me after I had their Carne asada plate.  They gave me three small corn tortilla and the portions of the meat were pretty small.  Extra sauce and soda refills cost extra.  But apparently their tacos are supposedly cheap and good, which might be their saving grace, giving them benefit of a doubt and good reviews from others, they get another star.    The 3rd star is for the pretty friendly staff and their really good spicy red sauce salsa.  The owner is an old man and he is very friendly and will help recommend u different items to try, like chicharon tacos and such.  His son is a little more quiet but service with a smile and efficient.  I think I prefer Rivas to this place as they make a decent plate with giant portions.  Only thing this place has above Rivas is their really spicy hot sauce.  The red sauce in a bottle is done right :). Also their asada is nicely grilled and almost every piece is a little crispy.  I guess the right way to do this is buy their sauce and bring it down the road to rivas :)  So perhaps if they improve their salsa bar, Increase their portion size to the price level and touch up some of the paint on the wall, they would come in with 5 stars.  Otherwise they are a 3 star hole in the wall spot with sit down prices."}
{"text":"We tried a breakfast burrito made of ham, egg & potato and shrimp ceviche tostada. Both were quite tasty. The tostado was a little spicy but good. The burrito was large and filling. Don't forget to ask for the green sauce."}
{"text":"We order here atleast once a week from work and we have always received warm friendly service and wonderful food.  The pricce is very good.  You get real food made fresh while you wait.  If you want it made a special way all you have to do is ask.  Very accomodating."}
{"text":"Just don't go here... This was the worst Carne Asada burrito I've had ever!!!  The place is a shite hole, their rolled tacos are over priced and not so good... They even messed up a veggie burrito.  Also, their guac was all dark like it was left out.  I spent 15 bucks here and me and my gal ended up making mac and chac at home.  I really can't explain how much of a fail this place is.   How can you be levels worse the Filli B's?    Not to mention it's like $0.50-$1.00 more expensive than any other Taco shack in Tempe.    I could see that it's family owned by a couple, and I feel sorry for raining on them, but how do you mess up Carne Asada????!!  Do yourself a favor if you're on Southern and have a burrito hankering.  Go to Rivas."}
{"text":"It's right next to REI!     And there's a picture of.. um.. I guess Cortez or Don Quixote or something but it's also a picture of.. uh..       They have pretty good coffee for a taco joint and their salsa is tasty.     If you've been to a *bertos you probably know the drill in general.    No surprises."}
{"text":"Even though they are listed on Entertainment website and have a coupon in the book they refused to take it so we walked out. Instead of honoring a \"valid anytime\" coupon for 4 bucks or so, they lost 6 orders. Bizarre business practice."}
{"text":"Just under $9.00 for a combo #2 Pork Burrito, rice & beans with a medium Melon drink.  The Burrito was dry, meat greasy, beans runny and only a few spoonfulls of pico de gallo in the condiment tray.  No Salsa verde or any red sauce at all.  Staff was surly and made me feel like I bothered them to eat there.  Why didn't I read the Yelp reviews before stopping in ..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate there the other day and we thought it was  good.  We were impressed.  I like to find excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican eateries and though I wouldn't say it was excellent, I would defiantly eat there again.  I have 2 complaints though.  They put that delicious food on Styrofoam plates and it actually melted and stuck to my food.  And bring your own fork because they use the tiniest little el'cheapo plastic forks in the world.  Also, they have a nice big screen TV for the customers, but tuned to Spanish speaking stations."}
{"text":"Pretty average for your hole in the wall Mexican joint. Prices are cheap and the food is \"meh\". I live right next to it and would rather go other places. The service is average too, nothing really special about it. Seems like a good place to go if you want to watch soccer. They have random pictures that are completely out of place. Wouldn't be my first or second recommendation for mexican food."}
{"text":"This might be one of those places that I'd be tempted to stop into occassionally if they had anything above average.  Unfortunately, their fish taco was good but nothing special and their 'service'... if that's what you'd call it, was not very friendly.  The only saving grace was the taco was only $2.  Too bad... the place looked cute!  Won't see ya here!"}
{"text":"Besides the fact that this place has awesome interior design and an amazing and authentic menu, they have half liter Mexican Cokes. Nothing beats a Mexican Coke."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times with my boyfriend. We love this spot and reminds me of a better version of taco mich/ king taco I haven't tried everything. the rice is a bit bland but the meat there is so good. Well cooked, I love their sopes, tacos, burritos. The price is fair. as much as fast food places are but this is way better quality. The asada fries are also very good, the French fries actually taste like they came from a real potato. They give you a good amount and aren't stingy with the meat portion."}
{"text":"No idea why this place is rated so low, but here is my 2 cents after multiple visits to this cheap, delicious hole-in-the-wall.  Their food is very good, much better than most fast-mexican type places like this, and their prices are cheap, like a 1.25 for a street-style taco.  Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Carnitas, Lengua all excellent, and they do small street-style tacos right, cheap and fresh.  Also had their torta, which was great. It's notable they also have more seafood than most fast mexican places.  Soccer usually on the big screen in the dining room is simply awesome too.  For the price and quality of food this is one of the best places in the area, try a few taco's and see for yourself...."}
{"text":"Upon yelp's recommendation I decided to stop by and I'm very happy that I did. The food did not come out right away, which in my opinion is a great sign that is being made fresh. When the food was finally delivered it was hot and absolutely delicious. I ordered the three mini tacos, those are the ones that have the the soft, corn and had one chicken and two shredded beef. There happened to be fresh cut limes as well as diced onions and tomatoes and cilantro in a delicious blend. I added some of that mixture to my rice and my tacos. To top it off, I just given a green sauce and a red sauce, both are equally good. It's probably about 75 degrees in here and the outside temperature is 110. Most of the Mexican restaurants I've been to In The Valley are usually only about 80 to 85 degrees in the summer but this place is definitely nice and cold. The location is also fantastic because it is right next to the gym so after my workout, I was able to refresh myself and cool down while my food was being made. So thanks to Yelp of course for basically telling me to check this place out, it was great. I apologize for not taking photos, I was so hungry after my workout that I didn't really think about it but I will be sure and took photos the next time I'm here. Thanks."}
{"text":"A perfectly acceptable strip mall Mexican joint that happens to be next to REI, which I found particularly convenient on the two occasions I had to go there during a recent trip to Arizona. Just thinking about the homestyle dishes they serve here is making me hungry for Mexican food right now. You fuckers are spoiled in the Southwest, I hope you know that. We don't get cafeteria food of this caliber where I'm from. One tip: don't order coffee.  One tip for the owners: is the gigantic TV really necessary? Also, get better coffee."}
{"text":"It was overpriced, I spend 15 dollars on a kids meal and my breakfast, and 1 coffee. Food was cold, rice was 2 days old. The French fries were stale. The meat was the only good thing about my meal. They only had instant coffee, I tried it anyway. It was overall a bad experience. Customer service was great, but menu needs a revamp."}
{"text":"I have only been once. I had nachos with meat and all that. Very good for Mexican take out. No drive through. Prices were lower and seemed like better food than your average XYZ-bertos. Thought it was weird to have a stern sign about how much hot sauce you're allowed to have. I was given plenty and even offered to pay. I'd love to know the story behind the equivalent of f-k you, only 2 hot sauce for you! Worth a quick stop."}
{"text":"So I was walking out of REI after picking up some last minute supplies for a backpacking trip, and was about to get in my car when I remembered I hadn't eaten all day.  So I popped in looking for some quick grub.  There were a couple of people ahead of me in line so I expected some sort of wait for my food, but it took over 10 minutes after ordering for my order to be ready.  This isn't a nice sit-down restaurant, but more of a \"fast food\" type, order-at-the-counter joint.  For a bean burrito and a couple of cheese enchiladas it should not have taken that long.  And it was definitely not worth the $9.  The bean burrito was okay if that.  The beans had no flavor (compared to other Mexican food places of the same style.)  The red enchilada sauce had a good flavor and definitely tasted homemade, but the cheese enchiladas were enchiladas minus the cheese.  Seriously.  All I was given were corn tortillas rolled up with a completely hollow and filling-less center.  WTF.  Definitely won't eat here again."}
{"text":"This place is OK. Nothing phenomenal. The breakfast burritos are OK, which is weird as usually they are absolutely tasty. I eat here pretty regularly as it is next to my job. It is definitely not bad. Just nothing to really blow you away. I did have one of the shrimp specials ($11!) and it was indeed excellent.   I wish they made their own horchata, or at least pretended they did. Watching them poor it out of the bottle I could buy is rather underwhelming. Not all of their Mexican coke is made with cane sugar (the number one reason I drink Mexican coke). so watch for that.   If you are near and hungry, stop in! I wouldn't bring people or make a special trip though."}
{"text":"The shredded beef tacos were not that good. The beef itself was like one long piece of beef. It was like the yarn ball of shredded beef inside my taco. Usually you expect the shredded beef to be, well.. shredded. I'm sorry but if you can't get tacos right then you don't deserve to call yourself Mexican period.  The menu was orange and you couldn't see the pictures of the food on it cause the color of the food was orange too.   The prices were reasonable. The other comment about the place looking like a clown went wicked on this place are justified."}
{"text":"Super great mexican food! I'm from a small town in southeastern Arizona with a lot of authentic mexican food restaurants, and this place was very similar. I had the hardshell chicken tacos and they were on point! The art was very interesting, to say the least. I would recommend this place to people in the area."}
{"text":"Average strip mall Mexican food place.. Food was alright and priced reasonably. I got an array of tacos. I felt the side effects later so I marked a star off for that."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch one day last week on a shopping trip to REI with the hubby. We both agreed we will not return. The meat was dry and the refried beans were soupy. Nothing tasted very fresh. There's a lot better choices for Mexican in the area."}
{"text":"Im not one that turns to yelp once I've experienced sub par service. However today I am.   Cashier was very mildly polite, not too much well known english. The premises was clean, and smelled good. The only down side was that the cook was not wearing gloves and touching meat that was going into my order. (2 sets on 3 rolled tacos.) Very unpleasant to watch all of that meat being contaminated by unprotected hands. I made a comment about it to another employee, whom had directed the cook to apply gloves afterwards. I went on to ask that my food be re-prepared with gloves and he obliged that it would. However the food came out more than promptly (which would imply that it wasn't made right.)  Being in my hungry, man up, fuck it mindstate I ate the contaminated food anyways. On that note however i won't be returning for any future purchases, and wouldn't reccomend that anyone does.  How's the health department gonna' give you an \"A\", but your cook isn't practicing safe food handling?"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.   We walked in ready to order our lunch.  The cashier was snotty when questions were asked and not very helpful.    We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited.  We were surprised at how long the items took considering how slow they were, however, our order came up and we were ready.  My husband ordered the tamales, and said they were the \"worst tamales\" he has ever had.  And trust me, they aren't always good.  I ordered the fish tacos, which completely fell apart and I was only able to eat about half of them.  The beans and rice had absolutely 0 flavor.    We were hoping for a good authentic Mexican restaurant experience and were very dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I love the #1. Three soft tacos. This is a nice little place. Good service and friendly staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, people and prices. This is better than your average Mexican food chain. You ow it to yourself to stop by."}
{"text":"I was leaving REI today and decided to stop in for a taco and a burrito at Taco Nazo. I am huge fan of cheap taco shops and will try just about any. This place will be on the list of \"Do not Return\".    The beans in my burrito were soupy and tasted burnt, and the shredded beef in the taco tasted like beef jerky. They also charge for chips and salsa. Lame."}
{"text":"Omgeee. Thank God this place is so close to my work. Even when I bring my lunch to work, I choose Taco Nazo. Big fat bean burritos are mmmmm :))) chili rellenos are good, rice is good, hot sauce is hot and they always have something fun on tv.  Try the pazole!!! Easy on the hot sauce tho ;)"}
{"text":"I don't understand how the average rating is so low for this place. We tend to enjoy grabbing burritos here whenever we're in the neighborhood. Great carnitas and Arizona Burritos (con pollo)."}
{"text":"Great go to lunch spot.  More authentic than the typical Mexican restaurant in Phoenix.  You know you're in good shape when you are asked, \"Corn or flour?\"  And \"Red or green?\" for hot sauce.  Salsa is available at the counter.  Drink options include watermelon, melon, horchata, soda, and water.  The menu offers 23 numbered lunch options six numbered breakfast options and an array of a la carte options and sides.  The TV is always in Spanish and the walls display paintings with optical illusions that blend in with the decor.  Look for Taco Nazo next to the REI."}
{"text":"If you frequent overpriced suburban wish fulfillment adventure outlets like REI, I would recommend you avoid the Taco Nazo and hit up the Schlotzskys instead. That way you can pay in excess of ten dollars for a mediocre meal to be consumed in a lively atmosphere, the perfect compliment to REI.   Leave Taco Nazo to us trash people that enjoy kick ass pork, pickled carrots, gigando delicious tortillas and as much flavorful (but not scorching) squeezy bottle hot sauce as our gullets can handle.   This place is in the weekly lunch rotation for me and my lunch crew, who generally show up coated in a thick layer of dust, dirt under the fingernails and salt crusted sweat stains pretty much all over. Nobody ever bats an eye. And if you're lucky you can get some cheap produce from folks hawking their wares out of their pickup beds out front.  Arrive hungry, horf down a burrito, and leave satisfied. What more do you need?"}
{"text":"There's no denying - it is a dive.  But they have very good food at a reasonable price, I especially like their street tacos."}
{"text":"I'm going to start my review based on the way we were treated when first entering the small restaurant and then I will give my review of the food that is TOTALLY based on the food and not the rude behavior of \"Ulysis\".  We first reviewed the menu as this was our first visit, the restaurant only consisted in 2 employees, 1 man on register and 1 cook. The guy at the register started out by saying \"this is to go right?\" We said yes and then realized that they were about to close. The guy was so rude to us, he looked extremely bothered that we were there. In all fairness it was probably 2min before closing time but the door was open and we had no idea, no bad intentions to keep them late! Now for the food review: we had a carne asada torta and the meat was seasoned well, the bread was toasted nicely! Rolled tacos were really good not your every day drive-thru that doesn't have meat inside however the lettuce must have been sitting in liquid because it made the rolled tacos soggy. Basic quesadilla was terrible!! Cheese was terrible quality and I can tell because of the lack of melting, the tortilla was also terrible and had a sweet flavor, the worst quesadilla ever!! Super nachos were ok, again well seasoned meat but it was mostly fat and hard to look past that, it also had that terrible cheese. So my overall review is that I would never return to this place!"}
{"text":"I've gone there a few times for work.  Absolutely love their Carna Asada Burritos..Yummy!!  A+++"}
{"text":"It was meh. I actually ordered lunch for my brother but had a bit of a taste. An hour later I was bloated. The chicken in the enchiladas was dried and old. I don't think I'll be stopping this border in the future."}
