{"text":"This is a old school, super casual, Cheap hot dog place that also does basics like breakfast biscuits and grilled cheese. Total junk food, but rewarding in its way, and very, very fast with blunt but charming service. Hot dogs are the simple boiled variety and frankly nothing special, and the crinkled fries will take you back to the 5th grade cafeteria. But if you need something right now, don't want to spend a lot, and are willing to make a few compromises in the salt and fact sectors, give it a try."}
{"text":"They hit you up for another buck and a quarter for lettuce and tomato on burgers. Skip that and keep a glass at work for your own tap water and have a great lunch value."}
{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do.  The atmosphere is nostalgic and casual, but the food just isn't doing it for me. The fries were tasty but undercooked, the grilled cheese super-oily and the hot dogs were unimpressive, to say the least.  At least they use nice crushed ice in their fountain drinks.  Out of ~40 patrons, all but two were middle-aged white guys (I'm getting there myself). I get it, it brings back the feeling of a simpler time, its just not worth the sub-par food. (I had a Chili Dog w/ onions, grilled cheese, fries & coke for $8.50) Seating is plentiful, including several booths & ~20 low-top bar stools around the edge. If you want something fast and cheap, I guess its not a terrible option.

Chili Man dogs are FAR superior."}
{"text":"I have been going to Green's for 40 years and I haven't found a better dog yet! I have found some that were close though. There are a few folks that have mentioned on here that  the chili is from a can. I know for a fact that their chili is homemade! If it is from a can maybe someone can email me and tell me which brand it is so I can buy it. The things I like about the dogs are the steamed buns. That way they are moist and practically melt in your mouth. The franks are boiled and they are fat and juicy. 
The onions are a sweet type like vidalia and they are choped real fine so they aren't lumpy. I usually get 2 all the way with a Pepsi. If you are looking for a really good hot dog I say give them a try and if you know of a better place let me know!"}
{"text":"Hit this for lunch recently.  Only tried the hot dogs - went with the standard mustard, chili, onions.  May need to retry Carolina style (with slaw).  This place has that \"been around forever and never changed a thing\" feeling that often signals time honored greatness.  Very, very solid play on the dogs - may upgrade to five stars on a revisit.

Would be interesting to hear more about burgers here, or breakfast.  As an aside, breakfast really comes in two forms - good and great.  Only with malice of forethougth can BAD breakfast be made.  A person or place that serves a bad breakfast would just as soon cut you with a knife."}
{"text":"A neat little lunch counter place, with good food, friendly service and cheap prices.  As in $6 for a burger, fries, and can of soda, plus .25 for a handful of m&ms from the gumball machine.  Hot dogs are good too in an old school way.  In an uptown littered with overpriced, mediocre lunch options, this place stands out."}
{"text":"Green's has been here for a long time, and is somewhat of an institution in this city. The hot dogs and burgers are pretty good, with their specialty being \"carolina style\" with chili and slaw. 

Food quality is decent, but the big deal here is price. Super-cheap everything is their motto."}
{"text":"Vvery good, cooked-to-order breakfasts for very reasonable prices.  I haven't made it in for lunch yet, but plan to soon."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs today.  Got chili and slaw - altogether a great combo!  When you want a dog in Uptown Charlotte - head over."}
{"text":"One word description: Dive. 

Order: Double cheeseburger and chili fries. 

Price: Super cheap, I doubt you are going to beat the price anywhere within 277. It is a freestanding building with food cart prices. 

Quality: Very meh. I generally am a fan of old school fried food. Ie skinny burgers with simple ingredients (ie American Cheese and ketchup). Obviously here I'm not expecting an organic thickburger with creative toppings. But I also don't expect for it to be obvious that the food was frozen and tasteless the day before. I'm not saying it was disgusting, I just literally think they could do better if they put in more effort. It was quite mediocre for old school burgers and fries. The chili was not very good either and the fries were pretty tasteless. 

Ambiance: I like the history and I guess its nice that they haven't redeveloped in what appears to be 40-50 years. It is very nostalgic, so I guess you just have to be in that sort of a mood. Bars on the windows still shows how much Uptown has developed in the last 20-30 yrs. 

Overall, if you like old school diners, maybe you will have a better experience than I did. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing on the wrong day. If I want hot dogs though, I'm definitely going to the Chili Man instead."}
{"text":"Center of the hot dog universe! Been eating here for 20+ years, never had anything but hot dogs (chili, mustard, and slaw) and french fries. It's the chili that makes this place special. They have other \"stuff\" on the menu, but what's the point?  And, the y have the best crushed ice on the planet. If they ever close the doors, I'm buying the ice machine."}
{"text":"Old school Charlotte.  Simple, straight forward , comfort food.  The hot dogs are average.  Their burgers  ANY BURGER-  is great.  I usually get a chili cheese burger.  Their breakfast is very, very good.  For the price, you really cannot beat this place."}
{"text":"Great old school hot dog. The chili is great. Very affordable and a Charlotte institution."}
{"text":"Not really a good experience, the hot dog I had was below average and I have had better service. On the plus side the price is right so I can't complain too much.

{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would.  Let's start with having a 96 sanitation rating.  Really?  You can have a rat in your kitchen and do better than that.

The service...well, just imagine grumpy old men and go from there.  When asked if they could cook a burger medium rare they said that it comes only one way, and that way wasn't that good and suggested the grilled cheese.  I mean...really?  They are a fast food lunch joint and don't even recommend their own burgers?"}
{"text":"This restaurant has such a wonderful nostalgic memory for us.  I was there with my sister in 2014 before we moved to the beach in 2015.  Hot dogs are excellent.   Started going there in the 1950's."}
{"text":"This is one of those places where the hype is bigger than reality.  Sure, it's an institution of a business that somehow survived the times without changing the decor for decades.  But the hot dogs aren't impressive at all, I was actually quite disappointed by them.  

In my order, I got two Carolina Style Dogs (mustard, onions, slaw and chili), with fries and a drink.  The drink is inundated with tons of ice, which quickly waters down any flavor the soda may have had.  The fries were so-so, nothing fancy about crinkle-cut.  The dogs were disappointing... since the hot dogs are cooked in a water pot, they should be dried off a little before putting in the bun; well, they didn't do that and I had a soggy buns as a result.  The slaw and chili didn't have any real flavor to them and probably would have been better without because of the mess.  Overall, I couldn't finish both dogs because it got too messy and tasted blah with the wet bun.

Honestly, I have had better hot dogs from the Green's lunch cart located in front of Wells Fargo than the actual location.  Prices are the same, cheap, and that lady doesn't mess around with soggy buns.  If you want Green's lunch, go to the cart, not the establishment.  Overall, there are better hot dog places in Uptown, though will cost more."}
{"text":"I had a BLT and cheese fries. The BLT and Cheese fries were ok. I think the thing here is the prices are reasonable (not that cheap for what you get, but reasonable) and the place has been around since 1926 and has the feel of a historic lunch counter. I think that's the cool thing about the place."}
{"text":"Basic dive with boiled dogs, some toppings, and french fries.  No frills served on Styrofoam plates.  Interesting throw back to days gone by and that's their hook."}
{"text":"One of the oldest hotdog / hamburger joints in Charlotte. Burgers and hotdogs are fresh and made to order. Charlotte Classic"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Hot Dog CART, not the restaurant.....However, I am rating their food (Chili Dogs), so here goes...

Met by Kim the Cart lady, and she was super friendly and explained all about Green's, how long they've been in business, etc. She also told me it was her birthday today, so Happy Birthday Kim! Told her that this big boy was a hungry, so she fixed me up with 2 loaded chili dogs, done \"Green's Way\" (minus the slaw - I still haven't learned how to love that). Got my Cheerwine and chips and headed back to the office to enjoy my lunch.

Hummmm, when I started eating the dogs, the FIRST thing that came to my mind was that 1980's Wendy's commercial with Clara Peller.....\"WHERE'S THE BEEF?\" Or in this case, WHERE's the DOG? Man it was tiny. The next thing I noticed was that the chili wasn't super flavorful either. In fact, it reminded me very much like \"the other chili guy\" down the street (he who's name cannot be mentioned). BLAND. I guess my version of chili and theirs is totally different! Go to the Charlotte Chili festival in Plaza Midwood and tell me how these 2 compare to that chili! No comparison!

Look, the dogs weren't bad at all. Relatively tasty, and the combo was less than $8. Not bad....

HOWEVER, let me tell you something Uptown workers of Charlotte.....there are 2 OTHER Street Vendors who sell hot dogs, both sporting the Sabrett Logo. They give you JUMBO dogs and FLAVORFUL chili that blows away either Green's or \"the other chili guy who cannot be mentioned.\" I would LOVE to do a BLIND taste comparison to see if my taste buds are on. And they are cheaper than Greens or the other guy.

So I'll give Ms Kim 5 STARS for being a Sweetheart, but the food can only be rated as average."}
{"text":"A stone's throw from Bank of America Stadium (I would say a hail mary pass away, but no Panther's QB's could complete it), on 4th Street, is a little slice of Americana known as Green's Lunch.  That is exactly what they serve.  Lunch.
On the outskirts of the hustle and bustle portion of uptown proper and before you get to the over-priced parking lot farms that are smattered about the stadium area this little greasy spoon sits unassuming.
Upon walking in, the age of the booths and the wallpaper let you know that this place has been here awhile.  At a glance, I recognized a \"best of Charlotte\" certificate from 1995.  Was that REALLY 16 years ago?!  Man....
The fare is basic.  Hot dogs, burgers, BLTs, sandwiches, fries, onion rings, et cetera.  Exactly what you expect them to accomplish with a two basket deep fryer, a griddle, and a fixins station of sorts.
They are known for their hot dogs.  \"All the way\" means mustard, ketchup, chili, onions, and slaw.  An extra 50 cents and you get some half slices of American cheese underneath all that.  Not bad for a two buck dog.
I would recommend it if you are looking for something off the uptown beaten path, feel like abandoning dietary restrictions, keep some Tums in your desk, and have a pack of gum handy for the afternoon."}
{"text":"Green's has some delicious hot dogs. No frills, served on a styrofoam plate, with old school fries. Old school as in that's the same fries they served at my old high school. Order at the counter, pick up at the counter. Their lunch is delicious. That's what gets them the second star.

Breakfast, however, is a mess. Again, order at the counter, grab a seat, and wait about 30 minutes for an omelet. The coffee is drinkable. The biscuits are delicious (but not available on weekends). The grits are...probably instant grits. Were it not for the convenient location, I probably wouldn't go to Green's at all."}
{"text":"A staple in uptown Charlotte. They've been in business over 90 years. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"I've been going here my whole life even though it's not a very long one at the moment but every time I go it truly hits the spot for a delicious good ole fashion hot dog. They have been around since 1926 and I can clearly see why. Particularly it's cheap. They have awesome ice for drink as well as I am a huge fan of their chili. Next time you are downtown and the mood for a hot dog you can't go from with hittin Green's Lunch."}
{"text":"I almost hate writing this review, because Green's is such a Charlotte institution. I almost feel like I'm dissing my adopted city by saying this, but I just don't see what the big deal is about this place. When I first moved here everyone talked about how the hot dogs were as good as The Varsity in Atlanta. News tip: they aren't, and they aren't by a longshot. What's worse, the three or four times I've eaten there the food has been lukewarm and inconsistent. Maybe the hot dog is cold, but the chili is hot. I dunno... I WANT to like this place, but just can't."}
{"text":"As someone who spent months after graduating from college with a diet consisting of equal parts Thai food(as I was a delivery driver for a Thai restaurant) and Costco hot dogs, I feel like I'm a fairly good judge of a hot dog. I was excited after moving to Charlotte when I realized I didn't live terribly far away from a \"famous\" shop that had a giant hot dog painted on the side of it. And on top of that, dirt cheap prices that almost rivaled Costco's $1.50? I was sold! 

Sadly.. it was not to be. Eventually I walked over to Green's one day and had a fairly tame lunch -- a hot dog with mustard and relish, fries, and a soda. Not a single part of that meal was even \"decent\".. I'll break it down:

The hot dog: Bland, generic bun -- think low end store brand grocery store bun. The hot dog itself was equally as bad -- it was *tiny*, chewy and not very tasty.

The fries: I'm pretty sure they were generic wholesale fries, I think cooked a little less than they should have been -- outside wasn't mushy, but the inside had a bad texture. They were completely unseasoned as well.

The drink: Ok, one out of three.. right? This is like the points you get for putting your name at the start of a test. Nooope. Somehow they ended up with the world's most aggressive ice crusher in their kitchen or something. The cup was filled to the brim with tiny little fragments of ice just short of resembling a snow cone. Then they filled it with soda, but given the cup was about 98% full of ice.. it was like a bad Coca Cola flavored slush drunk, unintentionally. I've had sodas that were flat, or the syrup in the machine was running low... but this was a new one.

Overall, my girlfriend and I agree that this is the single most disgusting meal that we've had in Charlotte. We had high hopes since a good hot dog is one of those things that can really hit the spot sometimes.. but I can't find a single redeeming thing to say about Green's, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and got two dogs all the way with fries. It's hard to judge hot dogs especially when they are nothing special. The food was really not anything worth writing home about,  I think this is just the case of place getting by based on their reputation and history. For all the hype I was expecting something great but ended up let down at how average it was."}
{"text":"Good food especially for the price. My hot dog bun unfortunately was soggy on one side and hard on the other. :("}
{"text":"Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week, when the lady saw me coming (she was on her cell phone) she hid behind the grill and didn't address me, so I walked away and went to another dog stand... is this the way they normally do business with the hot dog cart??"}
{"text":"This is one of those local gems!! We've been a couple of times for lunch and once for breakfast. Our lunch has consisted of hot dogs with chili and fries. That said I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs!! Once in a while I think we all get cravings for things we'd normally not eat. This is where Green's Lunch comes in for me. If I'm going to eat a hot dog I'm extremely picky about where I'll eat them from so that says a lot about Green's for me. The chili has a very good flavor but not over powering at all.  The hot dogs were good as well not mushy like some can be, rolls are steamed just the right amount. The fries are good, just the right amount crunchy, hot and not greasy. They offer many toppings for your hot dog as well as several other offerings on their lunch menu. As for their breakfast we had pancakes which were larger than the plate they were on, just the right thickness and fluffiness. My husband had sausage patties and said it's the best sausage he's had lately. We shared home fries, they appeared to have seasoned salt on them and were too salty for my taste. They were cold as were our pancakes, very disappointing to say the least especially considering we were the third and fourth folks in line to place our order upon them opening on a Saturday. The home fries appeared to be pre cooked/par boiled which is fine especially considering they'd be finished off on the grill, that said they were a bit mushy and cold. This may have been bc it was early, the grill not hot enough or bc the line was backing up out the door during our visit. We may or may not return for breakfast but I know we'll return for Saturday afternoon lunch. They have very limited hours I'm not certain what time they open on week days, Saturday they open at 9:30 and close at 2:30 which I believe is closing time on week days as well. I did notice a sign stating they'd be open in the evenings for all Charlotte Knights games. Give them a try, this isn't the type of place you go while watching carbs, calories nor fat grams. It's the type of place you may find in a typical southern town, exactly what we were looking to find!! All said even and I had to give 5 stars even though our breakfast wasn't as good as our lunch likely only as a result of the above mentioned factors. I doubt our breakfast experience is typical as they were packing them in while we were there as well as upon leaving."}
{"text":"If you're looking for that good 'ol skinny dog in a steamy hot bun, lovingly draped with chili and mustard then this is your spot.  It's the only thing we've eaten here and the dogs have that baseball park comforting goodness.  The people who work here are sweet and the place is clean.  Hit it up if you want some dogs!!"}
{"text":"Two dogs all the way, fries and a water for around $5.50. Can't beat the prices. I've had the burgers and would rate them as just ok but they are famous for hotdogs so what would you expect. Breakfast is also pretty good.

Definitely worth a try if you've never been there."}
{"text":"I realize that Green'a is a breakfast and lunch spot we would refer to as a greasy spoon in the NorthEast. I am giving it 5 stars because it is a hidden gem. Better known for its hot dogs, I tried the breakfast biscuit. It was the best I have ever had. The biscuit was like a cloud and the bacon and eggs had no taste of grease what so ever."}
{"text":"Not the worlds best hotdog as advertised.  However, a really, really good hotdog.  Home made Chili top notch. We loved it.  Then I asked what is \"Liver Mush\" the guy shows me this liver mush type pudding.  Why not?  When in Rome do as the Romans do.  So I order a liver mush with raw onion and mustard per recommendation of the employees.  It was really good too.  Fried and slapped on a bun. My wife couldn't deal with the grainy texture, but I ended up eating the entire thing, and I will have another if I'm ever back in town.  Great spot, Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs and prices, friendly staff also. Go to lunch here a few times a month."}
{"text":"Really simple fast restaurant in Charlotte.  Service is really friendly, prices are AMAZING you really get a lot for your money here. I come here specifically for their hot dogs, I tried them once when they had a street vendor during an event uptown and I fell in love. I was happy to see they have an actual location, and can see why they have dogs down pat - they've been in operation for years and years. I'll continue coming here as long as they have hot dogs (hopefully forever)."}
{"text":"Came here the other day for lunch with a co-worker. I'm not a big \"hot dog\" guy...in fact, I haven't had a hot dog in ages....

I ordered two hot dogs all the way with fries....
The hotdogs were AWESOME..!! Maybe it's because I haven't had them in a while...but it's more likely that they are just that damn good! 

The fries: I LOVE crinkle cut fries....so simple, but yet so good!!

If your in the area and can't decide on what to eat for lunch...walk on over to Green's...great bang for your buck...

I also saw that they have a breakfast menu...I will be stopping by one of these days for a quick breakfast sandwhich..."}
{"text":"For our last lunch in Charlotte, we headed downtown to Green's Lunch.  I was drawn by several reviews of the chili dogs and Ms T could always get another cheeseburger.

These were excellent, straightforward, nothing fancy, southern style, chili dogs and I liked them very much.  The chili is very fine with good flavor and a hint of heat.  The soft textured, well flavored hot dog is served in a soft white bun.  This is a classic Southerner.  I added slaw, which was finely ground, but pretty bland, although it did not mask the chili.  My extra slaw I doctored with Texas Pete and salt.  I wolfed down two dogs and certainly could have had another one or two, but stopped.

Ms T had a cheese burger which is not as good and I recommend you get the chili dogs here.  We were a little late, approaching 1:00pm.  The burger patty was pre-cooked, sitting in broth.  She reported it was a pre-formed patty, not really seasoned and of course not freshly cooked.  Oh well, her loss, she needs to learn to eat chili dogs."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!!
Hotdog OLD 
Chili OLD 
Onions OLD 
Fries OLD & SOGGY 

They don't need to claim they have the best hotdogs in Charlotte if I can get a better one off the street cart .... This may have been the worst hotdog I've had in my life. The staff were polite that was probably the only good thing about the place"}
{"text":"I used to eat here all the time when I worked closer to them.  I haven't been in an easy 10 years but went the other day for kicks and it was just as good and basically the same inside the place as it was the last time I was there.  Got two dogs all the way and a glass of water and I think I got out of there for around $4.50."}
{"text":"This place has been here for a long time. You can tell by the wallpaper. I love places like this with the old school counter and stools. Was hoping to get there in time for Saturday late breakfast, but they stop serving at 11. Ill be back for you western omelet.

To be honest, tiny hamburgers are the only ones I like. It's about the toppings for me, I don't like a lot of meat. These are perfect. Crinkle cut fries are good, and ours were hot and fresh. Would be better if they were seasoned, but I say that about all fries that aren't. All in all its a great, cheap lunch if you're out and about Uptown."}
{"text":"Time to update ye old Green's Lunch review.

I've been coming here for almost 11 years. My seven year old fake nephew loves this place. He's a real kid, we're just not actually related. This is what happens when you're my age and all your friends have kids. You become Aunt Nikki. And I love every minute about it.

There's nothing fancy here. It's not the best food on the planet. It's an old-school, Charlotte institutions serving up burgers, dogs and fries since 1926. Order at the counter then walk over to pay at the register. There are booths and stools with a lunch counter. Ketchup, Texas Pete, and napkins are on all the tables.

You can't beat the prices. Three adults and a child we spent $29 on lunch today. The kid had a hot dog and fries, the adults had three grilled cheeses, three chili dogs, a cheeseburger and chili cheese fries. Yes, we're those people. Add on a couple drinks and that's quite a meal for less than 30 bucks.

They do breakfast here. There's a Green's lunch cart over at the Wells Fargo Plaza. They also offer catering. 

Things to know:
1) They have the good ice
2) Free WiFi
3) Skip the parking lots around it. Look for street parking at the meters on Poplar. Download the Parkmobile app and it's as easy as scanning the meter to pay.
4) Romare Bearden is right across the street. Go for a walk in the park afterwards or let the kids play. We usually take the seven year old over before or after lunch to play catch or kickball. 
5) Closed on Sundays unless the Panthers are playing at home
6) They're open for Knights home games until 7pm"}
{"text":"How is this place still in business?  They say this is best hotdog in Charlotte...really???? these crappy little chicken franks  are the best Charlotte has to offer...that's funny.  I have had better at any random hotdog cart downtown.  The chilli they use is worse than that mystery meat Texas Pete canned chilli.  Terrible terrible terrible"}
{"text":"Felt like it was overrated, and anytime something has hype, it never lives up to my exaggerated standards.  That said, I don't think you should go anywhere else if you have a hankering for hot dogs.

Colleague and I took a short trek to Green's Lunch from Trade/Tryon and had a sit down there.  Tried to talk business and stuff, but let's face it, with two chilli dogs, onion rings, fries and crushed ice,  the only things being settled were when we'd head over here next time.  Food was great, prices dirt cheap and it's an old school spot. 

Love the slaw smack dab in the middle.  Beware of food coma even if you don't grub a lot.

{"text":"I have been eating at greens since I was a little kid. I still go there with my husband every Saturday that I am in Charlotte. It is a tiny little place that has been there forever but they have the best hotdogs around. The chili is smooth and yummy. They also always make your crinkle fries when you order them, so they are always fresh and hot, never sitting under a heat lamp.  Also, the people that work there are very friendly. We are regulars there and they always welcome us like we are old friends. If you like hotdogs, fries, and drinks with crushed ice, definitely give this place a try next time you are in uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"As with most things in life, you get what you pay for. Green's is an old staple of uptown Chatlotte's breakfast and lunch scene. The menu consist of burgers, hot dogs, fries, etc.   The set up is very basic. You go to the counter, order your food, slide to the other end of the counter to pay. Then you pick up your food at the counter. No waitresses. You are on your own. Fine by me, as my inner food diva is easily suppressed when a meal is under $6. I usually get two hot dogs for lunch and a soda. They are always warm. The bun stays together. Decent hot dog for a  decent price. I've had a bacon cheese biscuit for breakfast as well as sandwich. Both were just okay. My issue is that the cheese isn't one bit melted, which means that it isn't hot enough. Nothing taste especially great. Just average. So if you're looking for a quick lunch uptown and don't want to blow your budget on lunch, Green's is the place for you."}
{"text":"Green's lunch is a simple, yet classic staple of Charlotte. Nothing fancy here, but decent burgers, hot dogs and fries. If you're in uptown and want a quick lunch, green's will hit the spot. My favorite is a messy chili cheese burger and fries. The burger comes plain, but if you want to add lettuce or tomato there is an upcharge. Also, there is no designated lot, but you can usually find ample street parking."}
{"text":"This small gem has been around since little Herbie Hoover was president, and it serves one of the very finest examples of the Southern Chili Dog  a dish consisting of 2 meats, 2 veggies, and bread, a complete meal.

They serve other things here - burgers, sandwiches, etc - but the hot dog is the prize here, and should be ordered here, and ordered often. The dog is the star of the place, and the thick, meaty chili is the star of the dog. It is the thickest chili I've ever encountered, anf the result is a heavy, delicious dog.

The burger here is ok, but pales next to the dog. The fries should be avoided, little taste or texture. This is a simple, no ambiance diner, a little worn and weary, but worth seeking out. Every time I am in Charlotte near lunch time, the question is here or Price's."}

In a city that's changing and growing.   We need a place that has kept things the same.  Someplace that reminds us how it used to to be and where we came from.   

Thank you Greens!"}

The green dog is so special because it is so simple.  A long time tradition, this greek owned hot dog joint knows what they are selling.  Give it a try for an el cheapo luncho.. Trust me.

Enjoy.

{"text":"You haven't really been to Charlotte until you've been to Green's. Obviously they're known for the hotdogs, but breakfast at this place is a spectacular deal. You can get a full plate of eggs, grits, sausage/bacon and toast for about $3.75 and it's delicious. Awesome breakfast sandwiches as well. I don't know of anyone else in uptown Charlotte who can pull that off."}

They allow multiple versions of eggs and grits"}
{"text":"A tour of uptown wouldn't be complete without stopping for some gut-busting fare from Green's Lunch. Swung in here today with some coworkers and I ordered a grilled cheese (add tomato...which makes it healthy), onion rings and a Coke. So all-American.

My compatriots ordered hot dogs. We got out of there for under $13. 3 people. Lunch. No joke.

At first glance, you realize this is a super divey place, with photos from the 80s, BOB award certificates and framed newspaper articles. It smells a little...you know, just how you'd expect.

Service is quick and they move people in and out pretty seamlessly. Apparently they're known for their hot dogs. I didn't partake, but if I were into eating animal...parts, I would have.

I hear the chili is stellar, and the onion rings were crispy and delicious. More of a smooth casing batter for the onion rings, and I saw that the fries were crinkle cut.

I mixed up a little of the Texas Pete (on every table) with ketchup and used it as my dipping sauce for the rings. Spot on.

A true Charlotte staple. Definitely stop by and grab lunch sometime soon! It's quick, cheap and seasoned with just the right nostalgia."}
{"text":"I had two dogs, fries, and a coke for lunch.  The cheese was the individually wrapped American slices torn in 1/2, the bun was your plain white basic variety, the chili right out of a can, and the meat typical. Frankly (haha), it didn't do anything for me.  Because of some of the other stellar reviews, I'll have to give it another try, maybe the green dogs?  Friendly enough with a small town diner ambiance."}
{"text":"Breakfast was cheap, quick and good. 
Two eggs, bacon, grits and toast, around five bucks 
Next time I'm in town I'll try some of the chili dogs."}
{"text":"Old school diner, known for chili-dogs

Most of the reviews here are on point.   We were there early so mostly had breakfast which was darned good.  I was not all that impressed with the chili-dogs frankly (sorry...pun).  \"Lost in time\" type of diner.  Def worth a shot if you've never been."}
{"text":"I visited this place recently and adored the quaintness of the mom-n-pop feel. It's pretty popular with the locals. They are known to have the best hot dogs... so, please don't ask why I ordered a cheeseburger! I surprise myself sometimes, I guess. The fries were good, hot and fresh though! 

Can't beat the prices, for sure. For two adults, both with drinks and one with two hot dogs, that brought us around $13-$14. Local college students, you can have lunch here for about $5 and get some work done because they offer Free Wi-Fi. 

The only con, is the ordering of food. At the time, there was a local marathon that was just finishing near the park, so it was a little busy. Parties that were paying together, generally had to wait for the next person to place their order before paying. Small set back though, nothing major. 

Definitely coming back for breakfast next time."}
