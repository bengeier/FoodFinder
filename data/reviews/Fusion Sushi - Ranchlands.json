{"text":"Nice concept but poorly executed. It's sushi drowned in sauce and covered in parmesan cheese of all things. So incredibly overpriced $30 for all you can eat. Children under 10 are charged $15. I wouldn't go here again if you paid me."}
{"text":"An AYCE restaurant that I'm glad I found considering it's the best one I've been to so far. It's also the only place I've been to that fills up almost completely during lunch, even during the weekday. That being said, either go earlier or a bit later, not during rush hour if you don't want to wait for a table. The parking lot isn't very big either so it may take some time to find a spot.  Their interactive iPad menu is very convenient and efficient as your order will go straight to the kitchen without ever having to flag down a server. The selection is pretty good though not very extensive. We always order a bit of everything and nothing has disappointed us so far. The food is quite fresh, presentation is good, and portion sizes are decent (the menu tells you how many pieces per order) so we always leave very full. I like that they offer a few specialty rolls too, which you don't get at most other AYCE places.   They did forget a few of our nigiri sushi one time and the waiters sometimes leave food sitting at the counter for quite some time before bringing them to the customer's table.  For $17.95 per adult, it's the most expensive place I've been to so far. However, I'll definitely be returning again and would recommend to anyone looking for a decent AYCE sushi restaurant!"}
{"text":"Probably my new place to eat Japanese food. Food portions are good and well prepared, space is accommodating, people are friendly and the price is just right! We will be back with friends."}
{"text":"When you think of all-you-can-eat sushi restaurants, two things come to mind; the food is usually mediocre (which makes sense, it's all-you-can-eat) and the decor is usually run down and old. Fusion Sushi was NEITHER of these things! The service was pretty good (it was very busy, as we went during the grand opening, so the servers were a bit slow on beverage refills, but as soon as we asked they were quick and helpful), the decor is new and updated, though a bit boring.  But the food was everyone's favourite - it was the BEST all-you-can-eat sushi I've ever eaten, and the three friends I brought with me all felt the same way. The sashimi was *almost* as good as places that are two or three times the price.  In short, if you like eating a lot of sushi this is the place for you. We will definitely be going back, as the food you get for the price is just awesome!"}
{"text":"Love it! Quick service, good sushi. They did mess up and give us someone else's sushi. We ate some of it then realized and then we told them to take it away because it was too much and they didn't charge us because they messed up. Good sized portions so you can order different things. I highly recommend the general chao's chicken and the cheese wontons if you go for dinner!  Pretty clean and a lot of parking."}
{"text":"Been here thrice this month, the customer service is better now as the servers keep checking our table for our drinks and empty plates and had time to chat and or joke with us, the ordering from paper has been updated by using an iPad so no more missing orders and fast delivery of our foods. The salmon belly is really a good recommendation from my friends and I'm happy to keep coming back to this place. Space is good for group of friends."}
{"text":"Awesome place! They get really busy over the weekends so I would suggest going there on a weekday. The decor is simple and nice. Sometimes they have anime music on which is a big plus for me.   The service there is usually great. They can get a bit slow over the weekend but generally quite attentive. Barely ever had to ask them for refill of drinks. I usually place the order sheet on somewhere obvious so I don't have to wave for them.   The food is what get me back every time of course. Sashimis are nicely sliced and very very fresh. Handcones are really tasty as well. For the thai part of their menu, I usually go for the pad thai, garlic beef and cocnut shrimp. They usually bring the food VERY FAST so make sure you don't order too much on your first round if you are sitting on a small table.   Already been there several times and never been disappointed. Would recommend to friends and family for sure."}
{"text":"I really struggled writing this review as my mother always said \"If you can't say anything good don't say anything at all.\". But what good is it to give only positive reviews?  When I saw that Fusion Sushi and Thai had opened my immediate thought was \"Japanese and Thai fusion\"? Japanese and Thai food are quite different from each other so I was unsure what to expect.  My curiosity finally got the better of me so I checked them out earlier this week.  We were quickly seated and given our menus. I don't usually go to AYCE so the menu needed a bit of explaining. Outside of drinks everything on the menu is covered under the AYCE price ($27). Just write it on the pad what you want and they bring it.  We started with some green curry chicken, basil beef and a shrimp dish (I forget the name) from the Thai side. From the Japanese side we got some rolls, sushi, grilled mackerel and sashimi. Everything came out quickly as they weren't too busy.  I don't know if I'm totally spoiled by really good sushi and Thai food but wow was this stuff bland. The curry barely had any curry taste and was just spicy hot. The other dishes were very, well, meh. Just so bland.  The sushi was small and didn't seem all that fresh. Even the spicy tuna rolls were bland.  Amazingly enough the wasabi was bland! How can wasabi be bland?  Service was ok when bringing the food but our table soon became cluttered and we used the side table for our empty dishes. Not overly friendly. Never asked how our meal was.  Fusion restaurants always interest me as I like non-traditional takes on traditional dishes. I am kind of baffled as to what exactly is \"fusion\" on their menu. They try to do a lot of things but do none of them well.  I really don't recommend this place at all!   Honestly, unless they improve the quality of their food drastically I doubt this place will still be open by the time summer rolls around."}
{"text":"Meh. The concept is good: all you can eat...basically you sit at a table and fill out a paper form when you want more food for the table. The waitstaff rush by and grab the paper and then bring the food. The cost is set; there is a 90-min cap to the \"all you can eat.\"  However, what really happens is you wait outside for a very long time because for some reason the restaurant is really popular. Once seated you write down what you want and the ticket gets picked up. The first round of food is fairly quick. There is nothing really unique on the menu; it's rather generic. We struggled to find the \"Thai\" aspect; maybe their definition of Thai is different from ours. It's really a sushi/Japanese place. The achieved stars are for the freshness of the fish. The sashimi was butter soft. The rice dishes were meh and anything with chicken/beef was drowned in super sweet sauce... also meh and kinda gross.  Portions are really tiny and this is where the hitch in the process begins. After the first round of food, it is nearly impossible to get anyone's attention: for water, beer, pickup of a new order sheet, the bill, etc. We sat for 45-minutes after the first round of food and got plenty of \"be there in a second\" call outs but no actual attention. After the second round of food we could get no one's attention. The people at the table next to us said, \"don't even try.\" They had exceeded the 90-minute cap and barely ate any food; they had a \"$29 piece of sushi\" on the table because they'd mis-understood the ordering process. We had difficulty getting someone's attention for the bill once our 90-minute limit had passed.   I guess the catch is you need to order TONS and TONS of food on the first round with the expectation that the servers will never come back. BLANKET ORDER EVERYTHING.  The thing that pissed me off the most is that the entire meal cost $66 for two people and we barely ate any food; it's a complete rip off. I've eaten in other sushi places around Crowfoot where the quality of food is better, the quantities don't leave you hungry, and the price is reasonable.  Honestly, I can't fathom why this place is so popular. I miss the restaurant that used to be there: Aioli. And, to add insult to injury, the new restaurant moved in without changing the decor -- so it basically looks like Aioli (motivational statements and all)... but with crappy service/food. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Yes I know...five stars? Really? Yes!   First off, I'm not too sure what the \"1 star\" people are expecting. You live in landlocked Alberta so no, the fish won't have been caught this morning, but speaking as someone who grew up on the coast, the sushi here is way better than other places I've visited (I'm looking at you Sushi Boat).   When you walk in the restaurant doesn't smell \"fishy\" and the sashimi texture is really quite good! Plus, in comparison to other 'all you can eat' places, the quality is way more consistent and the presentation is far superior. The staff here is very friendly and I love the never ending green tea! Also, while it may not be a concern for some people, they have a ton of vegetarian options beyond the basic avacado roll.   Anyway, this place is great. Yummy food, lots of variety, and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Small place, menu is an IPad, that is cool, the order goes directly to the food prep & kitchen, what took restaurants so long to adopt that technology, how often do you try to get the attention of a Server and when you do, they seem to take exception to the fact you look frustrated. Food is fine, the choices could be greater, portions small, we only had the \"all you can eat\" Ok don't intimidated me before I started ordering,.... Overall it's fine! Ok value for foodies"}
{"text":"An amazing amount of options to choose from for an all you can eat sushi place. Add to this the Thai food that you can also order included in the AYCE price, and it'll be my new go to place. I can put away $20 to $30 worth of sushi very easily, so the $28.95 price for dinner was well worth it.  The size of fish pieces on the nigiri were smallish, the rice balls weren't oversized, and it is all you can eat so I have no problem with it. Normally nigiri is $2.50 to $3.50 per piece for a full sized piece. The amount of options for the nigiri were a bit limited, but the amount of options of everything else on the rest of the menu well made up for it.  I was surprised the special rolls and sashimi were also an option for me. Everything I ordered was very good, and I no complaints about the quality of anything.  I will definitely be going back again, and recommend the Tom Yum Goong soup."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here for lunch all you can eat. Most of the stuff they serve is pretty good. Except for the red and green Thai curry. It was very bland. However I will come back again and try other stuff in the menu. They do have more variety than other all you can eat places which is nice."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday with 2 adults and a 5 yo. Great selection and the ordering system on the iPads was great. Everything we ordered was delicious including edamame, tomago, yam rolls, beef roll, udon, tuna nigiri, dynamite roll. Lots of selection and all you can eat for $17.95 lunch. Kids was $6.95 which was a great deal. He costs me $15 at other sushi places."}
{"text":"First, the definition \"Fusion\" can be misinterpreted as fusion between two different ethnic ingredients mixed together to create some palatable dishes. However, in the case of Fusion Sushi - Ranchlands (owned and operated by Thai), only means two different ethnic dishes and by no means both Japanese and Thai ingredients are actually \"mixed\" or of \"fusion varieties\" If you are going there with the former, you will be very very disappointed and highly DO NOT recommend. If you are still thinking of Thai or Japanese foods as a separate dishes, please read on...  This was my first time going to this restaurant, with both me and 3 of my friends went for a lunch, all you can eat, when we went in, the place was about half filled, a waitress (Michelle) greeted us and we sat in the booth and ordered the following with review rating:  1 = Horrible, 2 = Bad, 3 = Fair,  4 = Good, 5 = Very Good, 6 = Perfect:   1) We ordered Green tea (which was not technically green tea, when I looked at it carefully it was actually a lukewarm water, I then asked one of the waiter and told him about it and couple minutes later, he gave us, not green tea but a \"Genmai-cha\", which isn't a green tea).   The genmai-cha taste was very saturated, mostly attributed to it being sitting in the pot for many hours, without replacing with the new one. My speculation perhaps is that staff did not understand what \"green tea\" means and so I did not bother since they do not serve green tea in the Thai culture. Although they still charged us for the teas and did not apologise. Rating: 1  2) Tempura (yam) - only contained 2 pieces     Rating: 2. Taste on the \"koromo\" (tempura batter) is soggy and greasy, my first impression was that they did not change the cooking oil as often,definitely was not fresh, moreover the yam itself was still not fully cooked. Could not believe contained only 2 pieces of thinly sliced yam.  3) Spring roll - only contained 2 pieces     Rating: 2. Too greasy to our tastes, maybe good for others, but we certainly did not find spring roll to be that good and also it did not contain much meat inside, felt like I was eating a crust.  4) Avocado Roll (4 pieces)     Review: 3. The rice was little bit soggy, but fair for all you can eat lunch, the avocado was not that fresh as the flesh turned brown on certain section (Minor part). The amount of rice vinegar is also fair. Although traditionally in Japan, they put more rice vinegar to make rice taste a bit more sour which complements well with raw fish, except octopus.  5) Nigiri sushi (6 pieces)      Review: 1. The reason why I put down 1 is because the the rice was still warm !!! Big offence to a Japanese cuisine. Also it hardly had any rice vinegar mixed in it. Very plain and mackerel fish was not fresh and little bit warm as it was sitting on top of the warm rice, partially cooking it. I could not believe it, hence the rating of 1.   6) Pad Thai (half serving size)     Review: 2. The reason why I would come to a Thai restaurant, without a doubt is to try the Pad Thai and I always do every time I visit Thai restaurant. However, pad thai was not good at all, hardly could taste the fish sauce nor tamarind. My impression on the sauce was eating a Heinz tomato ketchup diluted it with water and added some peanuts, sugar and salt. Also No Cilantro was added. I guess this is what you get for all you can eat lunch, definitely not traditional and authentic by any means. to add insult to the injury, the serving portion would not even be good enough for 1 adult. I would be ok for an authentic pad thai with little portion, but it would not be acceptable when they can not deliver either  I was going to review their customer service, but at this point, it is irrelevant.   So Fusion - Sushi (Ranchland) in a nutshell is for those who just go there and fill up the stomach as much as you can before reaching 90 mins (all you can eat time limit) and do NOT bother with the food quality or authenticity of the cuisines.  My sincere recommendation to those who may be thinking about this place for a lunch, is to try restaurant that only specialises in ONE cuisine, whether it be a Japanese or Thai."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Lots of variety and fresh. Dessert options are awesome too. Must try fried scallops, fried cheese, fusion roll, mango roll, spicy salmon chips, pineapple fried rice, Tiramisu shot, mango ice cream, fried milk and bananas!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great selection. Everything was fresh and tasty. Actually found the chicken lo mein to be my favorite.  The spider roll was really nice. The salmon is above average. This was one of the better all you can eat sushi places I've been to. Too bad I'm just passing through."}
{"text":"Food quality was good, it just didn't have the flavour I was looking for.  We ordered through skip the dishes and chose this restaurant because it was the only restaurant with Thai food that delivered to our area. Maybe thai food isn't their specially, the red curry chicken was too bland for my tastes. Maybe had we ordered in restaurant we could have asked for more spice.  I'll be trying somewhere else for my thai food next time"}
{"text":"This is a all you can eat Japanese and Thai restaurant. They have very efficient way of ordering; use of Ipad so you don't have to track down waiter or waitress. Only problem I had was that food didn't have much flavor. Maybe this is a great for people with big appetite who wants quantity."}
{"text":"Bones are us. Went to fusion sushi and ate all I could eat.    My salmon sashimi had bones in it.  It's $28.95 per person.   Avoid a lot of rice to get your monies worth.  Don't fill up on appies.  Even after telling them that the spicy salmin rolls, and sashimi had bones(showed them proof).  All we got was a blank look and \"oh..sorry.\"  Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place its a great place to take friends, you get your moneys worth easily if your hungry as its all you can eat. The ipad is a really fun and cool way to order. The food is not bad, but i go there mosty for the environment and experience. My favorite is definitely the chicken fried rice and i will be bringing hungry and/or hungover friends plenty more times here in the future"}
{"text":"My favourite Fusion Sushi location so far (I have also tried out the Mcknight and downtown locations).  I have been here twice for all-you-can-eat dinner on weekdays.  I have to say the food first time was very good and way better than the second time.  For both times, there is a good selection of sushi and cooked items.  Salmon sashimi is usually fresh.  Tuna sashimi had a very bland taste the second time and did not taste fresh.  Beef short ribs and tempura are pretty delicious.  Mango pudding and green tea ice-cream are great to finish off the meal."}
{"text":"Food here is good for all you can eat, and the service is good.  The sashimi are sliced in large pieces and the nigiri's rice size compared to the slice of fish is perfect.  However, they seriously need to consider reducing the amount of rice in rolls (around 75% rice) and add more flavor to their soups."}
{"text":"Fresh, affordable, delicious. The ika nigiri is always perfect, and one of the main reasons that this Fusion is superior to the other two locations in Calgary, who don't offer ika on the all-you-can-eat menu. I have only two complaints: I wish seaweed salad was offered on the lunch menu, and I found the vanilla ice cream to be a little on the bland side. Otherwise, always a good experience."}
{"text":"I really like this fusion sushi place and they have friendly staff! Ive been to this branch a few times and i will continue coming back for more sushi and jap-thai food offerings! food is great a d presented well! Service was also great! I just wish they didn't stop serving seaweed salad!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Fusion a visit recently and unfortunately we walked away disappointed.  First impression when you come in is that they have packed far too many tables into the space, with no design to add any kind of privacy or intimacy to the experience.  The restaurant was completely packed, and as a result service ran at a pretty slow pace, which is to the diner's disadvantage when you consider that the AYCE has a 90 minute time limit. It took a while for the drinks to arrive, we had to flag down a server to take our first order, and we never managed to get in a second order.  Service tended to suffer because things like plate clearing and drink refills happened mostly with our assigned server, rather than the entire staff. The cramped conditions meant that most of the plates got placed on the side of the table closest to the walkway and we had to rearrange them to keep the table from being unbalanced.  Service was ultimately so slow that we ended up asking for the check and leaving before the final two items came out, around an hour after our order went in (I have no idea whether it was lost or just really delayed).  The food itself was passable, but the Japanese/Thai/Chinese combination left me thinking of the idiom \"Jack of all trades, master of none.\" I could not identify what the core specialty of the cooks was, because all three cuisines left me wanting. The Pad Thai came out in a pool of liquid, the sushi rolls tended to be over-sauced, the tempura came out a little too pale (and the sauce was forgotten).  As far as value for the cost, at $27 per head you could buy a good amount of small plates at an Izakaya, get a higher quality, and walk away sated and satisfied. Here you're left thinking that for the price, you need a big appetite and faster service to get your money's worth."}
{"text":"The food is alright, but the California rolls come with an overpowering amount of cucumber which kills the flavour entirely. The teriyaki chicken is rather nice, with the teriyaki beef lacking flavour and seasoning. Overall the atmosphere is good and the staff is friendly. It's not for everyone."}
{"text":"The sushi was good for an all you can eat lunch special. The cones were quite yummy. They also have gluten free soy sauce which was nice (for the fad dieters or celiac sushi lovers).   Down side that ruined the whole lunch? HORRIBLE SERVICE. The waitresses could rarely be bothered to come around. We watched as one particular waitress only helped one table who she was obviously involved with because her hands were all over one male patrons.  Our server in particular, (named Ada) gave horrible service. She avoided our table, wouldn't make eye contact or notice our frantic waving. Every time we wanted to order more she was no where to be found for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. We had to resort to calling out to other servers or at one point shout in her direction for service.   Sushi = good Service  = needs serious improvement"}
{"text":"I appreciate how they are concerned with my orders and top of that the sushi was really delicious. I had a good time and recommend this place for sushi lover's"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a great find in Fusion Sushi!  The AYCE is fantastic!  The restaurant just opened this week and is offering a 10% Grand Opening Special until March 15.   You can order practically anything in the menu by filling out a list.  Exception is beverages.  Keep ordering till you can't eat anymore!  All the food was cooked fresh; the sashimi and sushi was so fresh.  The sushi rice is not dry at all like some places I've eaten.  Moist and thin layer of sushi rice for their delicious rolls.  The rolls are packed with loads of more of the food than the rice which is so refreshing!  Interesting dishes like Grilled Mackerel, Spicy Salmon Pizza (like the crunch factor), prawn and broccoli tempura (freshly done and piping hot), Beef roll with Enoki Mushrooms.  The salmon and tuna sashimi were sliced quite thickly and were very fresh.  AYCE Price List: Lunch 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mon to Thu.     Adult $16.95  Senior $13.95. Child (6-10 yrs). $9.95 Fri-Sun & Hols Adult $17.95. Senior $14.95. Child (6-10 yrs). $10.95  Dinner 3:30p.m. to 10 p.m. Mon to Thu.     Adult $26.95  Senior $21.95. Child (6-10 yrs). $13.95 Fri-Sun & Hols Adult $27.95. Senior $22.95. Child (6-10 yrs). $14.95  Children ages 3 to 5 yrs $5.95 / Kids under 3 years old Free.  Wait service was very attentive.    At the end, we could even get ice cream - there are 4 flavors - green tea, vanilla, strawberry and mango.  When can I go again??  SOON."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Futuristic iPad ordering, great service, beautiful location and venue, and fantastic food. I would recommend getting an all you can eat pass for 29$. You can't go wrong with a single thing on this menu. My absolute favourites were the tempura roll, the mango avocado roll, and the tiramisu. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"THE WORST - I died because they were gonna charge me AN EXTRA $10 per un-clean plate, they were literally like my mother when I was young. The sushi was not fresh, I feel sick. Fusion Sushi gave me diabetes and I think the only good thing about that place is the fried banana (vanilla icecream with it is the BOMB). The waitress was quiet as hell and pulled the \"extra fee\" from her asshole. UGH IM PISSED $38.50 LATER - not worth it. Check out Kinjo in Dalhousie...  Fusion Sushi SUCKS. Overpriced garbage. They literally wouldn't give us the bill until we ate the rest of the food... like what? We maybe had 4 rolls left and a couple coconut shrimp pieces... I FELT HELD HOSTAGE"}
{"text":"What a strange place... Strange, if not weird. You know these movies where a gang takes over a store, and pretends they are employees? Serving stuff to somehow nervous customers, until suddenly pulling out the guns and yelling everyone down on the floor?  That kind of feeling.  Weird!  And the food was not particularly impressive, either. Better than bento box, mind you, but nowhere near the prices listed. It also took a while to wait, despite the place being almost empty.  I mean, forgetting about the gang thing feeling - I doubt I would find any reason convincing myself to visit Fusion Sushi again. Why. If it is so boringly ordinary otherwise."}
{"text":"This is a great place for buffet lunch on Monday till Thursday. Why? On Friday and the weekend the prices go up and the bill suddenly is not so attractive. Same story for dinner.  It is not a secret, the prices are clear and the waitresses can double check with you that today kids are (almost) full price but when you are addicted it is hard to leave.  I like the concept. You get a IPAD, you form your own order and send it to the kitchen. In 5-10 minutes your dishes start to arrive and you can order more and more for lunch buffet with a fixed price.  The food is really good. Obviously in a busy place like this some dishes can be more successful than others. The menu is big so we always eat more than we should. The portions are small but you can order 2 of the same, right? The service can be hit and miss. Most often these are nice polite waiters but a couple of times there were overwhelmed young women with very limited English and no smile. The washroom was out of order once( or was it the same day)? It is a minor thing anyway. Totally worth coming and trying!"}
