{"text":"This is definitely my FAVORITE place to eat when I'm looking for HK style cafe in Richmond Hill. I come here a few times a month for their meal deals!  Its a small little cafe inside a plaza, it's owned and ran by an elderly couple. They're super friendly and welcoming. The husband is the main chef and cooks everything at the cafe, the wife is mostly on the floor, serving and making the drinks. You can ALWAYS see a smile on her face, no matter what time of day, which day, how the weather is outside, how busy the place is, how many customers there are in the cafe, 24-7, she's ALWAYS smiling, even when she's by herself behind the counter! For sure, changes your mood when you even look at her!  They offer deals from breakfast (8:30am - 11:30am), lunch specials (11:30am - 2pm), afternoon tea (2pm - 5:30pm), dinner specials (5:30pm - close). They also offer daily specials from open to close ranging from noodle soups to rice combos. All of these deals includes coffee or tea, extra cost for cold drinks or other substitutes. Certain combos even come with soup that's homemade, usually with some pork meat and vegetables.  Prices are very reasonable, or should I say cheap comparing to where they are located and the quality of food and portion they give! For any of the combos, it's definitely enough for one person to eat and leaving with a filled stomach! The milk tea that they serve are great too, you can taste the bitterness of the tea along with the smoothness of the cream in it, good ratio of a HK milk tea, can't expect it to be the best you ever have but I'm very satisfied!  If you are looking for something cheap and good value in this area, this is the place to go! Will continue to come back for food; paying $6 -$7 for a good, filling meal with a drink is for sure better than cooking at home and cleaning!"}
{"text":"What a gem! That lady is too sweet and makes you feel at home.  It's solid Cantonese Chinese home cooking. Nothing overly salty or sweet just the perfect balance.  If you're craving for some authentic Canton food, give it a try. There's something more satisfying eating here than the neighbours. It's a refreshing change of what normal greasy take away is.  This place can't get any more original.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but only order items on their daily specials menu, otherwise the ingredients are not fresh. Milk tea is a bit week. Satay beef was really mushy. Located beside a Chinese herbal store, so unfortunately, the smell seeps over. Shop in need of renovations. There are usually tables available even when nearby places are swamped."}
{"text":"Family owned cafe.  Their portions are bigger than golden flower (directly beside them), but the quality of the food is slightly lower.  The old lady is really sweet and makes you want to come back.  Typical HK style cafe, not bad. I usually eat here when golden flower is too busy."}
{"text":"Cafe No 8 is another Hong Kong Style Cafe in Richmond Hill.   The place is a little run down and in need of renovations.   Great value for afternoon tea set $3.75 includes a noodle of some sort and a drink.. great selections and choices and decent portions. Good if you are here for a late lunch since it starts at 2:00 pm.   The Milk Tea is a little weak though but nice and hot! The Spaghetti with Meat Sauce I cannot comment of the pasta being al dente but is good in full filling my carb cravings..   A nice family working in this restaurant from the front to kitchen....   Cash only!"}
