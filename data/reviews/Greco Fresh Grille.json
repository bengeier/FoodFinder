{"text":"I was so disappointed after reading reviews.  We ordered a gyro wich was good but the french fries were super soggy and oily.  The salad was so slappy cut huge and had 3 little squares of feta cheese then the grilled chicken I added to it was gummy like they microwaved after was grilled and sitting there. It was pretty gross dry and chewy."}
{"text":"Lemon and oregano fries are amazing. Who knew? I also had the chicken gyro. That was good but not as overwhelming as the fries.

Really attentive staff. Highly recommend this place for anyone in south Charlotte."}
{"text":"My food was really greasy and cheap looking. Don't see too much difference from Showmars, but maybe I should've expected that"}
{"text":"Greco Fresh Grille is a tiny shop tucked in Blakeney between Five Guys and Brixx. The parking can be a chore but well worth it even if you have to walk a little distance.

Hands down the best for a gyro sandwich. The lamb is fresh. The flavor and texture far exceeds the normal pre-frozen strips you get at other places. The pita is soft and chewy and the homemade tzatziki sauce is delicious. 

I often order the Greek salad and ask to have lamb meat added. The salad is light and the dressing is a perfect compliment. I only wish the salad itself was a little bigger.

Of course no meal here is complete without the fries. Lemon-oregano is my favorite. I eat way too many and savor every bite. Citrus, salt, herbs...mmmm!

The owner is wonderful and greets his patrons, cooks, busses tables, and mingles with the guests. He is invested in his business and customer service. The personal touch adds to a terrific lunch.

This is our go to Greek!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food, Fantastic Service, Fantastic Value!  Friendly staff, authentic food, budget friendly prices."}
{"text":"Fries were excellent. Spinach phyllo were really good especially dipped in the tzatziki. A bit worried about longevity d/t no one else there the two times we have been."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Greek food. We were super impressed with the price and delicious food. We will definitely be back! Love it! The veggie gyro is amazing and my husband loved the chicken gyro. The hummus is superb and the fries were perfect!"}
{"text":"I've never had mushy gyro meat before and I never want to again.  We walked in and there was a man at the grill BANGING on these slabs of meat, I thought it might be chicken or the pita and couldn't figure out why he was banking on them like that, but when I got my gyro, I realized it was slabs of gyro meat that he was hitting to make flat and then he would cut them.  Gross.  Not how gyros are supposed to be made!!  Fries were good, but not worth going there for fries.  My friend had a salad, but the feta wasn't crumbled and there was hardly any dressing on it.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Came here by chance, loved it! The owner and staff are so nice....It is rare to see such happy employees. The food is outstanding and I don't know why anyone would choose the pizza place next door over this!
Highly recommend the seasoned, handcut fries!"}
{"text":"We were thrilled when Greco Fresh Grille opened their new location in Fort Mill as we would regularly drive all the way to Blackney for their food!   

Giving four stars instead of five as the food could use a little more salt (the food in the Blackney location tastes noticeably better), by overall the staff is welcoming and the food is still great!

My favorite part about this restaurant is that they have plenty of vegetarian options, so I don't have to order the same item on the menu each visit!

Be sure to try their baklava at least once!"}
{"text":"Brst spot for a quick Greek meal in town.  Stopped in the other day with my wife and ordered the chicken gyro, garlic and cumin fries and baklava.  The food was amazingly good.  My gyro was served brimming with fresh cut seasoned chicken breast in a warm pita accompanied by red onion, lettuce, tomato and tzatziki sauce.  The fries were fresh cut and seasoned perfectly (better than the 5 guys fries next door).  The baklava was baklava...they all kinda taste the same to me, though it was still delicious.  Prices are reasonable and the place was nice and clean.  Folks in the kitchen wear disposable gloves when preparing food, which was a welcom sight."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to tega cay! The food is delicious! The kids meals are a great value! The mezze platter is my favorite thing on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very good and reasonably priced.  Love the gyros and the different fries.  My boyfriend is Greek and he gives it a thumbs up too.  We've been coming here since it opened.  I believe the man who opened it came here from NJ.  He and his family are very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Fantastic and flavorful food! Very excited to have additional ethnic food options around. The owner is extremely friendly and is very keen to please his customers with any of their requests. I only had the chicken gyro which was very well seasoned and combined nicely with the warm pita and the tzatziki sauce. Love it. Will be back to try the other items."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great fries but the gyros was not good. 

I've been searching for a delicious authentic style gyro for a while and its not here. I've ate at enough Greek restaurants and gyro food trucks up north to know the difference. I was expecting my gyro to be prepared a certain way. Unfortunately, the lamb meat was cooked on a flat grill and it doesn't taste the same to me. If a restaurant is going to use a flat grill to \"warm up\" the meat versus cooking it on a spinning griller. I can simply cook my own gyro at home. It taste better when the meat is cooked and sliced on the grill spinner.  

Where are the restaurants that cook the gyro meat on the spinning griller??"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly people.
We've tried just about everything on the menu.  The lemon fries are tasty and the salads are always fresh.  The chicken on the pita is usually a little dry, like it is warmed over, but tasty.  We eat here every few weeks.  We also get takeout from time to time and the serving is always generous.  Nice to also sit outside in the back when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Fort Mill needs good food and this one has it down.    I ordered the greek salad with a side of tzatziki sauce and added chicken.  The sauce...is ...well it is much better than mine and I am a pretty good cook.  The salad had big chunks of feta and REAL greek olives.  Was above my expectations.  I did not want to order fries but had heard they were very good.  I let Nick know I would love to taste them. but did not want a full order...he offered me a few and oh yeah...
Best fries anywhere around!  He gets an A+ too for hospitality.  So glad to have this restaurant in our town."}
{"text":"You owe it to yourself to have the Lamb Gyro with seasoned fries. Absolutely the best around. Live music starts this weekend at Blakeney, and Greco's the perfect spot for a date, a meal with friends, or a night out for the family!"}
{"text":"My daughter in law and I stopped here after our manicure. We turned the evening into a girls' night. It was a great choice. 

We each got the Greek salad with chicken added. All while we were eating, we kept remarking on how fresh the sale was. The feta comes in little squares. Fresh tomatoes quartered. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 is that my chicken was a bit too dry. The salad was very filling and delicious. 

We exercised some restraint and didn't get dessert because we have up sugar. Dang!"}
{"text":"OK the traditional lamb gyro was excellent.  I would give it 5 stars.  I got a combo with the fancy fries.  I give the fries 2 stars.  The flavor is excellent but the texture is poor.  They are cooked for too long in oil that is not up to temp.  Too greasy, too limp.  Bump the temp of the oil up 25 degrees and shorten the cooking time just a bit.  The hummus was very good.  Not the best I've ever had but very good.  Service was pretty quick, food was hot.  Simple place. Place your order, pay, sit, wait, they bring your food, eat.  I left a small tip at the time of the order.  Price is good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kefte gyro with their lemon+oregano fries and loved it. Their tzatziki sauce tasted fresh and the onions were crisp. Their fries were really tasty, too -- and ketchup complemented their flavor too, it didn't detract from it.

The atmosphere is very bright. It has a new, modern feel to it. Their bathroom was very clean and well kept, too. 

Definitely adding this place to my list of regular haunts."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh ingredients in this family run business. Their love of what they serve and the passion in which they serve it is great. The food is casual, wonderful and reasonably priced! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food!! The food is so fresh. Crisp greens, AMAZING gyros!! Falafel is on point son!! Make sure you get a fresh slab of baklava. Prices are amazing, staff and owners are Incredible."}
{"text":"Lemon oregano fries!!!! Cumin garlic fries!!!  (which we dipped in some extra zazikki) hand cut, crispy and  wowza!! I had the lamb gyros too!! Soooo good. Plenty of seasoning, the zazikki is home made, cucumber and yogurt goodness.  I did eat mine in the foil wrapper as the juices want to slide out the back. Lol. The food is served in plastic baskets which makes it hard to eat with fork and knife but there are plenty of napkins to be had. 

The place is in a strip mall, just a little hole in the wall but clean and nicely set up.  Place your order at the counter and have a seat. Only took about 10 minutes for our three orders to come up. The staff are all friendly and attentive and the owner chatted with us while we ate. 

I recommend saving room for the home made baclava. Layers of crispy FILO, just the right amount of honey and yummy walnuts. Fresh and moist! 
All those flavors created a party in my mouth!!

Thanks! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  My family gets take out from here a lot.  I usually get the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  It's not a boring old salad.  The chicken is delicious and there's also feta, greek olives, cucumber, tomato, really good dressing, and pita wedges.  My husband opts for the lamb gyro which is delicious.  Their garlic and cumin fries are out of this world and an order is definitely large enough to share.  The staff are super friendly.  It's also a nice place to eat if you want to grab a quick bite and eat outside while shopping at Blakeney."}
{"text":"My husband and I regularly drive an hour to Charlotte (from a tiny SC town) to get lunch at the Greco Fresh Grille. Bright decor, friendly staff and owner, but the food is the hands-down best part of this establishment. 

My husband's favorite is the lamb gyro and lemon oregano fries, and my new favorite are the spinach pie triangles. Paired with a wonderfully garlicky tzatziki  sauce, I absolutely devoured the treat. 

My family lives in the area and dines at GFG at least weekly, and we continue to rave about it to all our local friends. Can't wait to keep trying new items off the menu - we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Always consistent, excellent food and excellent service.  I took my aunt who married into a Greek family and she was really impressed with their Gyros.  It's hard not to over order.  I've only had Greek food this good in Large cities.  The lamb is outstanding!  It is not the pressed kind because it is real....they cut it right off the lamb on the vertical rotisserie."}
{"text":"The best Greek food in the area. Excellent!!! I had the gyro and it was extremely well put together. If they dropped the price $1 or $2 I would be here literally every day for it."}
{"text":"Had the lamb gyros and it was super tasty (and i've tried a lot of gyros!).  I also got the spicy hummus.  Will definitely come again and owner was super friendly which is a great bonus :)"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Seriously, drop whatever your doing now and run to Greco Fresh Grille. The menu is simple; greek salads, pitas , gyros, kabobs, veggie options. I am on a bit of a health kick, so I asked if they could serve one chicken kabob with a side of grilled veggies(not on the menu). The cashier was more than accommodating,  and said it wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later, she brought out my food.  First i took a bite of the grilled veggies They were flavorful, and not too salty. Next came the AMAZING chicken kabob. With out a doubt,  the best I've ever had, and that's coming for a girl who loves Greek food. It was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection with herbs/spices from the heavens.  I scarfed it down in 5 minutes! To top it all off, the owner and his staff were friendly & make you feel right at home. I will definitely be a regular at this place. It's a ten: great prices, fresh ingredients, and awesome service. I'm thrilled that I found this gem in South Charlotte! :)"}
{"text":"Visiting from Baltimore and stopped in for lunch.  Had a gyro and fries which were outstanding.   The lemon basil fries were crispy and very tasty and the gyro is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Such tasty green gyros and produce for toppings.  Love the gyro with Garlic fries.  Must visit in bLakeney  area."}
{"text":"If you're in need of a quick gyro fix - this his the place.

Although not the \"original\" gyro, where they shave off slices of grilled meat on a skewer (which is hard to find in the US for some reason), this place is pretty good.

I usually have the gyro platter which comes with their awesome lemon/oregano fries and a small salad.

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Super fresh veggies, delicious hummus, and one of best gyros around. I don't stray too much from those staples as there is no need, but I am always happy to sample what anybody else I am eating with orders...and it always is just as good as my favorites. Only complaint is I don't love their salad dressing and usually put my own on when getting take out. However, the greens and veggies are so fresh the salads are still worth it."}
{"text":"We tried this a few nights ago and had reasonable expectations since they had just opened.   We ordered the Tzatziki Appetizer Dip, lamb platter and the traditional gyro  plate. Food was amazing! Portions are generous but not to much.  Fresh! And delicious. Service was friendly and exceeded our expectations.   Felt like they had been open for years and not a mere 3 days!  We will definitely return often."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch!!!  Delicious food in a friendly environment, even for families with small children.  Gyros are great, tzatziki outstanding and pitas are even better!!  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I was in there the other night for some authentic Greek food. I was not disappointed!
I got the salad, the olives did have pits ...but other then that it was perfect..the Lamb was think and flavored nicely.
I would highly recomend them!"}
{"text":"I thought I got a Greek platter with a peasant salad to go. I actually got just the gyro meat, cucumber and tomato salad and seasoned fries instead. They definitely up charged for what I ordered and I have no idea what went wrong. The meat was seasoned well and juicy but nothing amazing. I'm pleased my tomatoes were properly ripe - nobody likes a soggy tomato. The fries had a fantastic cumin flavor that wasn't too heavy but the fries themselves were maybe overcooked? Bleh. I also got grape leaves. The filling was perfect but a little heavy on the lemon. 
Overall the food I got (not ordered) was average and close-ish to authentic flavors. I'd have to eat in next time in case my order needs correcting again."}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was fantastic.  I had the gyro platter and would strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"They ground their own lamb, which means you can order a rare burger. They cut their own fries. They check on you and ask how you're enjoying your meal. That means they care."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for about a year now and am just getting around to writing a review.  I absolutely love their food and the people who work here are just so warm and friendly.  You really feel welcome when you walk in the door.  I have introduced several people that I work with to this restaurant and everyone who I have brought just raves about the food.  I always get their Greek salad with grilled chicken and it is so good.  My husband loves the gyro and their fries are awesome.  I wish they were closer to my work so I could come more often!"}
{"text":"Was very surprised by this place! Was my wife's idea to try it and it was awesome! I had the salmon pita with a salad and it was delicious! Will definitely be back and next time we are bringing our neighbors!!"}
{"text":"If you like gyros, hummus and baklava this is the place.  A nice change with so many places over doing it, they have a straightforward menu and everything was delicious.  Staff was super friendly and we will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Cool, quick and good eat! The lemon parsley fries are a must have. The shrimp pita was fresh and delish! The tzatziki sauce was a little much...may ask for little next time. Greek salad was just that...nothing more and nothing less. Local fav!"}
{"text":"Great service and AMAZING food!! I discovered this place about a month ago and we eat there at least twice a week! Everything on their menu is delicious and fresh! 5stars!!"}
{"text":"My husband is Greek.  100% Greek.  As in, Easter means the family roasts a whole lamb on a spit. Uncle Dimitri will offer you the whole head of the lamb.  Meaning our wedding, yes was very similar to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the movie.  AND...everyone's last name ends in OPOLOUS or ISIS. 

We know Greek food!  Greco Fresh Grille is the real deal, and like the name says, FRESH. 

GFG is bright and cheery inside, and immaculate.  There's a definite blue and white Greek theme going on-- but it's modern and fresh.  

Most Greek restaurants, I'm sorry to say, don't serve real tzatziki sauce.  Most places use a cheap pre-made, preservatives-laden substitute, or they'll use sour cream.  (GROSS!  For sour cream, have Mexican food, mmmkay?) Not here.  You can tell the sauce is yogurt, you can tell someone has shredded cucumber into it, and the garlic is nice and strong.  Just how it should be. 

Another pet peeve of most Greek joints, is the gyros are made from a pre-molded mystery meat that just gets shaved off a spit to look like it's the real deal.  It's not greasy and Pepto-Bismol-inducing.  It tastes distinctly of lamb and spices. The gyro is moist, the pita nicely warmed on the flat top, and full of flavor.  The really friendly woman who served it to us, suggested keeping the foil on, and unwrapping like a present as you ate, so not to make a mess!

My husband's lamb burger was delicious and unexpected.  Very clearly this was lamb, and it was served on a pita, not a bun.  Our only suggestion would be to season the patty itself more, and to include yogurt sauce with it. 

Instead of fries with our combo, we subbed salads-- not the traditional salads, but the shredded cabbage and arugula one. (The Lahano) It was crisp and refreshing.  I'd like to have seen more arugula, but bottom line, it was a very nice accompaniment. 

After we ate, my husband was in the mood for fries, after seeing someone else with a piping hot basket.  The lemon oregano fries are killer!  Think hot, fresh FIVE GUYS-like fries with the skins on...and freshly cut...except crispy on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside.  Then add plenty of lemon juice for tart...salt and oregano...mmm, we ate it all!

After overhearing another customer say \"...since I had the hummus here, I can't eat the stuff at the supermarket...\" we asked the cashier if she thought the hummus was good.  She said it was great, and gave us a small sample cup with two flavors, a traditional one and a roasted red pepper feta.  Alongside, were 4 mini pita wedges.  Again, super fresh. (I'm used to more tahini in mine, but I suppose this is different than Lebanese hummus.) 

The most rockin' way to end a meal...the galaktompoureko.  This is a traditional Greek dessert made of an eggy, custard, set with farina, between sheets of buttery phyllo.  HOLY MOLY don't tell my mother-in-law...but this is the best version I've ever had.  It's flavored with orange zest, and super light but creamy and milky....oh how to describe it.  Just give it a try.  If you like flan and rice pudding you'll like this. 

Bottom line, we were really impressed to find a Greek place that does things right.  They're owned by Greek people, and obviously hire good employees, because every single person we talked with was kind and helpful. 

My only wish, is there was a Greco Fresh closer to where I live!"}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try Greco's for the first time and it was delicious. The smell when we walked in was divine. The gentleman behind the counter was so nice that he made us feel like we were his family walking into his home. He checked up on us as well and had a deep love for his food (which I love to see). The food was perfectly prepared and amazing!! Will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service with one of the most courteous staffs imaginable. Has become one of my favorite places to dine.  Thanks Nicholas for bringing this to Fort Mill."}
{"text":"We love going there for their Gyros and also the Lamb Burgers... don't miss the fries... without a doubt the best in all of Charlotte.."}
{"text":"Fantastic...go twice a week ...my 12 year old whose a picky eater begs me to go For chicken skewers...I love the gyro. Must go!!!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion,this is the best new restaurant in town. Fresh, authentic and delicious. I was so impressed that I returned the next day to sample more menu items. I'm a regular now and the food is always awesome. 
The staff is very friendly, I always feel welcome and appreciated."}
{"text":"This is the real deal!...Fresh cooked off the grill,just like the name! I had chicken kabobs which were tender and moist.The oregano and lemon fries were off the charts and I know I'm in trouble now...Have vowed to eat them only once a week! Great service...greeted upon entering(very important to me) Owner sat and chatted with me and shared his history with me. I will be taking my foodie friends there and am so proud that this is my find! P.S. the Hummus and Tzatziki are fresh as well and incredible...Great neighborhood spot...!"}
{"text":"Greco Fresh Grille is absolutely excellent.  This was my second time going there and I really loved and enjoyed the food yet again.  I ate the Grilled Chicken Gyro and it was fantastic.  I loved the fries, especially with the lemon and oregano flavorings.  Delicious!  Also, I had the traditional Greek salad which was amazing!   And not to mention the baklava with or without ice cream  was outstanding either way!  Great atmosphere, nice Greek music, friendly staff and cheerful owner. Just moved here from New York and stumbled upon this wonderful restaurant and  I will definitely be back with my whole family soon!"}
{"text":"I travel a LOT! On my travels I always eat at whats rated as \"the best\" whatever ethnic restaurant I can find in the city. I cross tab the 4 sites I use and I SERIOUSLY count on the reviews so I take time to write honest non-biased reviews. I always try the local Thai, Pho and Greek.
So when I found Greco fresh years ago I fell in love with it. Let me explain.
There are dozens of Greek/Mediterranean restaurants in every city. Seems Greeks love the food biz. 
If you like an awesome quick-service Greek anytime of day then you'll LOVE Greco. I promise! Give it a try. It ROCKS! THIS IS NOT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT!!!
First of all Mia is very friendly. But what makes the place a favorite of mine is the fresh ingredients in each dish. The Greek Salad is perfect with JUST the right amount of oil and vinegar. The Feta is amazing! Perfectly slightly brined JUST like I like it. The olives are authentic, not some bland olives bought at Walmart.
Do yourself a favor...try the Salmon Pita. And if you're not watching what you eat...HECK, even if you are, try the lemon oregano fries. You can't eat just 1!!!
I've been to 3 of the Greco's and the food is always perfect and brings me back time and time again."}
{"text":"This was my first time here- tried the veggie pita and lemon oregano fries. Fries were soggy and pita was full of watery liquid. This place has great reviews so I'm guessing others have had better luck than I did with their choices, but based on this experience I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!!!! I am so glad they opened near where we live now! Went to the Rea Road store when we lived nearby, now we don't have to go so far!!  I love their Gyros! Everything is so good! THANK YOU for opening here!!"}
{"text":"Another update on Greco Fresh Grille as they've been open now for about six months. We stopped by last Saturday around 3PM and the place was hopping. Great to see they're doing such a brisk business.

They've added a few new items to their decor, and a few new specials to their menu. Pastitsio was listed as a special with the description of \"Greek Lasagne\" - sounded good but I was there for the gyro and fries. 

The food was great, but I wish they'd offer a combo with side items other than fries. Perhaps some hummus or a small greek salad. It's so easy to go there and get a gyro and fries, and then leave feeling like you've eaten something as heavy as 5 Guys next door.

The owner is there every time I visit, and he stopped by to check on how things were going. This is still a winner of a place to me. It's exactly what I'd hoped for when they opened."}
{"text":"Tucked in between the Five Guys and that God-forsaken Encore Bistro at the shopping center at Blakeney is this quaint and quite delicious Greek restaurant that adheres to simple options and a ginormous bowl of tasty.

I always lean towards the salad to start with, especially the Peasant Greek salata, chock full of giant tomatoes and a super generous serving of red onions, cucumber, and oil and vinegar. Sop all this up with generous serving of pita wedges. Feel free to ask for me, if you run out of pita wedges. And while you're at it, sample their hummus; choose from the traditional, or be bold and try whatever wacky-yet-gastronomically-awesome combination the Mad Hummus Scientist in the back's whipped up for you.

Main course, I can't stay away from the grilled chicken breast gyro. Generous, and I mean GENEROUS servings of diced chicken breasts, smothered (but not drowned) in tzatziki. DELISH! 

You gotta have their hand-cut fries. Sure, you can play it safe and order the plain hand-cut fries, but be bold, the same way our Greek forefathers were bold, and plop your pretty little face into a basket of the lemon oregano fries. I could make a meal out of these delish little delights on a daily basis. Who cares if my arteries clog up with thick coats of peanut oil and lemon oregano? You only live once.

Everything here is clearly fresh and homemade, and if you the Greeks, you know they take their food seriously. They respect the dish, and you better damned well respect the dish too! Their homemade hummus and tzatziki is available for take out as well, so pick some up for home. Perfect for entertaining guests. Or yourself. Whatever works.

I also love the contemporary Greek pop music that's piped in on some Sirius XM radio feed. I'm noshing on my grilled chicken breast gyro and bopping my head to some Greek version of \"Call Me Maybe,\" and it occurs to me that my bopping may be misconstrued as mockery. Oh, come on! I love \"Call Me Maybe,\" especially when sung in another language!

Also, as a side note, I've seen Steve Smith of the Panthers eat here a couple of times. If this place is good enough for the best player ever to wear a Panthers jersey (and why am I gushing, considering I'm a lifelong Giants fan?), then Greco Fresh Grille is good enough for me.

Another also: Steve Smith is really short for a wide receiver. I mean REALLY SHORT."}
{"text":"Had a hard time finding it in the large shopping area but were successful at last.   Greco is a very small restaurant but the additional outdoor seating helps.  You order with the cashier and they bring your food to the table.  My husband had the gyro platter and I had the lamb burger.  Everything was hot and fresh.  We were very happy with our meals and will definitely return whenever we are in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and good Greek food. The gyro was hot and dripping in flavor. The kefte was quite tasty."}
{"text":"This is not the place you go to if you don't like salt. Everything is salted to heavy. Food portions are small for me also. Seating area is very small and very bare. And don't forget to take your clothes to the cleaners. The grease smell is everywhere. Been there twice to give it a second chance. No more."}
{"text":"The lamb gyro is the best I've ever had.  Their Greek burger is amazing as well!!  The burger comes on great bread - not a bun, and it's excellent.  It comes with lettuce, onions, and tomato on it.  The platter with fries and a drink is definitely the way to go here!"}
{"text":"Love the dolmas and the tatziki and hummus and pita bread. Delicious spanikopitas too! Always friendly and fresh and quick. Authentic food."}
{"text":"\"Rapida atención, la comida deliciosa. Él gyro tradicional y él grilled chicken...yummy\" Volvere pronto :p"}
{"text":"One word AMAZING!!! I'm Lebanese and from New Jersey it will be a Year that I'm living here and to have a Greek place right down the street from where I live is a bonus it was my first time there and it won't be the last! They have a decent menu and was so excited to try the hummus which I got a small garlic hummus as a starter and it came with delicious pita bread which was warm and soft just perfect, the hummus was so good next time I go I'm ordering a large one  then for lunch I got the traditional Gyro and words can't describe the party that was going on in my mouth it was so good the spices on the meat was so flavorful the tzatziki sauce was perfect I love extra so next time I'll have them out more on it! I'm a sucker for baklava so you know I had to try it and I so wasn't disappointed it was one of the best I've had in very long time. The owner's of the place couldn't have been any nicer they even took time and sat down with me and my friends who have been there before and it turns out the places they owned in NJ I've been too before such a small world! I'm so glad they came to Fort Mill they definitely have me sold!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten both take out and eaten in at this cute little hole in the wall Greek restaurant.  I am so very impressed at the freshness of everything and the flavors are to die for. I've never been a fan of dolmades anywhere else as they are usually slimy and tasteless.  I'm proud to say that they have completely and totally changed my mind!  Lemony and firm and beautiful.  Gyros and hummus are home made and beautifully presented.  The tzatziki is freshly made and has the right amount of garlic.  This is hands down my favorite Greek place!"}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel wrap with sea salt fries. First of all the lettuce was going bad- it had black all around the edges. Secondly the sauce was a lot chunkier than I remembered it being at other Mediterranean places I have gone to. The falafel was large which would have been nice if it hadn't been cooked to long. It was burnt and too hard. The wrap was mostly falafel and onions. The fries were so so, nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Solid choice for lunch. Good fast-serve chicken kababs and salad. But those Lemon Oregano fries -- great!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly service, especially for the price. We were not expecting a family owned restaurant in this shopping center - nice surprise. We will be back."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and the place is clean. 
Its a good place for a quick lunch but the portions are small and the seasoned fries are way to salty. The flavor of the gyro is there but they give you such little amount of it that its disappointing."}
{"text":"Always my first choice for Greek Lunch.. love their fries and lamb gyro.

Been going here for a few years now... Good location at blakney"}
{"text":"This place is a great find and departure from the norm. It's a nice little establishment located fairly close to home. The food is always great and the prices are fair. The folks there are great people as well. What I also love is they have different flavored fries. 

My only qualm is since I'm from the Midwest, our gyros back home are packed with so much meat that the pita has zero chance of touching the other side when being rolled up (you literally need and get a fork), so out here I'm getting about 1/3 of the meat at the same price. But if you're from here you'd never realize what you're missing out on. 

One tip is to not get the fries to go unless they're dry. We got the lemon topping and it was soggy at home :(.

Overall, no question, put this place on your list."}
{"text":"I love that Fort Mill has the option of Greek food! The owner of Greco and his wife are friendly and attentive. Greco Grille provides good food- I especially like the freshness of their Greek salads and their gyro meat. While dine-in, portions are generous. I sometimes get a Greek salad to go, and am disappointed with the portion sizes for the money. That's the only reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great value! I have been here twice and it is consistently awesome. (Just as wonderful as when I  ate here for dinner in May.) Both times I had the vegetarian pita. Thank you for having a hearty vegetarian choice on your menu! (Instead of always having to eat a salad when I go out) The pita was stuffed with several kinds of veggies and excellent sauce! I must say it was so delicious and filling I almost forgot it was meatless! The food is always wonderful, but what further impressed me was the temperature. I got my pita to go for lunch and I pulled it out 20 minutes later and that baby was still piping hot! Thank you for perfectly wrapping it in foil, so it was not a cold mushy mess when I finally got to eat it. If I lived in Charlotte, I would eat here every week! I dined here yesterday (09-09) and already I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable fries....maybe the best I have ever had!!!!! Chicken and Veggie Gyro incredible. Not sure what they do to the chicken but it is so flavorful. The Greek salad is also delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"This place lives up to the yelp hype. Delicious and fresh fast food. Smiling courteous helpful staff. 

Best falafel I've had in a long while. I had a self modified Greek salad and it was great. Simple but perfectly spiced vinaigrette. Baklava is worth a calorie splurge too.  I split the generous piece with 3 people:)"}
{"text":"On a return visit, my husband had their Gyro, and said it was one of the best he's ever had.  I had their shrimp pita....OMGsh!!!  It was SO good!"}
{"text":"I'm not one to leave reviews, but hands down one of the best baklava's I've ever had. The falafel pita is also delicious. You can tell all the ingredients that are used here are fresh. I've ordered from them quite a few times, but the baklava is what hit it out of the park for me.  Everything in general has been good. Can't emphasize enough the best part of the food here is that it's fresh and nothing over seasoned."}
{"text":"I had the chicken Gyro and spicy fries and it was amazing. Full of flavor. I will definitely be back. The food here is wonderful. The decor is lacking, a little tacky and isnt anything to look at, but the food is well worth a stop. This is a great spot for takeout."}
{"text":"We were very excited to see Greco coming as we had been to one of their other locations!  We have been twice since their opening and both times were fantastic!

 First time I got the traditional gyro, and the second time I got the chicken gyro.  Hub got the traditional gyro both times.  Both of mine were good, but there is something about the traditional that is so good!!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Both time we got fries, the first time, was cumin garlic and second was spicy.  Both just okay, we preferred the lemon oregano we had at another location, do we will probably go back to that one next time.

Service is good too.  Can be slow when it is busy, but that is to be expected. 

Highly recommend and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best places I have ever eaten ... The people were so nice and good was so great will be a life long customer ..."}
{"text":"Thanks to the weekly yelp e-mail last week, we decided to travel out to Greco Fresh Grille for lunch on Sunday.

My husband had the traditional gyro with lamb and I had the chicken gyro.  We split the large lemon fries.  They do not cut you short on the portion size.  The large fries were way too much for the two of us, but they were sure good!  Subtle hint of flavors, but enough to notice and have something different.  As far as the gyros go, they were some of the best we have had!  They are packed full of meat and both the lamb and chicken had some awesome seasoning/flavor to them!!

The only cons came from my husband, which I do agree with his first con - the location, great location for people in Ballantyne, but not great for us, maybe they will get another location in Rivergate.  We will come back, but it just won't be frequently.  My husbands other con, the sweet tea was not very sweet!  

They have a fantastic outdoor seating area - all for the neighboring restaurants as well, but we got to bring the dog and enjoy the nice spring weather outside! 

Overall, we would highly recommend this place for some flavorful Greek goodness!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least 2 times a month. Great food that is fresh and priced reasonably.  Owner and his brother are both very accommodating and will fix anything you ask for. 

Best gyro in the S Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Great little things place. Quick service and pretty full menu options. The humus was delicious and they sell containers of it for take out. Very friendly staff and warm environment. Greek salad and gyros are great too."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on a Thursday right after they opened.  Great service and even better food.  The falafel was fantastic.  It was a lot of food and well worth it.  While we were eating the crowd really started to come in.  The lines don't lie.  This place will become a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Ok food, nothing too special. The prices are a bit high but you have to understand the area you are in. Anyone truely complaining due to price should not be here. Food on the other hand is nothing special as I said. I've tried a few things and its just meh."}
{"text":"This place is new to the area, and has already become a favorite lunch spot! Although you can't go wrong with the traditional gyro, I have ventured on to other things on the menu and love it all! Although, I do wish they had tabbouleh! Also, the service is great, and fast despite the well deserved long lines at lunch."}
{"text":"Good and fresh but not traditional pressed gyro meat. Not sure why. Also..online menu prices are wrong, or I was mistakenly charged for something I didn't order. Either way, not bad, not fantastic

Tonite we decided to try this place again due to the  fact that we were DYING for chicken gyros.  I have to say it was hugely better than the first time that we tried it so I am changing my review. It was AWESOME tonite.  Amazingly fresh...very tasty, and the gyro meat was not dry at all like last time.   Much better experience and now we are going to be regulars!  Wish I had waited to give it a second try before I reviewed it bc tonite it definitely earned 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Their hand cut fries seasoned with lemon-oregano are crispy with the right amount of lemony taste and flavored with aromatic oregano. It''ll be better with a little less salt. The hummus , Greek salad and grape leaves are delicious."}
{"text":"The Chicken Gyro with fresh cut Lemon Oregano fries is AMAZING.. So why didn't I try this place sooner??? That's the question that taunts me to this very moment as I write this review. I'm in Blakney shopping, enjoying the live music on the weekends and taking my daughter to get Five Guys (right next door) and not once did I think to step foot into Greco until just recently. My husband and I were hungry and of course my daughter wanted Five Guys and we of course are not fans of burgers and greasy fries. So my daughter suggested we step into the quaint restaurant next door and we DID. This was one of the BEST IDEAS ever, we both ordered the Chicken Gyro and my husband got hummus as a side and I ordered the Lemon Oregano fries (which my husband ate majority of). 
The service was on point and the food was made FRESH and the taste was perfect. We entered the restaurant only 15 minutes before closing and the manager was so nice in catering to us and coming over to the table and talking with us trying to figure out the same question we ask ourselves \"Why is this our first time in the restaurant\"? He ensured us that we would not be disappointed and he was definitely correct. We LOVED it and we have been back twice since our first visit and I indulged in the same item, my husband has also tried the lamb burger and he enjoyed it.

Check out Greco Fresh Grille and again I highly recommend the chicken gyro and the fresh cut lemon oregano fries."}
{"text":"The gyro salad is amazing and the lamb meat is sensational!! For the salad they give you a generous portion. The meat, olives, feta, tomatoes and cucumbers are a fantastic combination. You also get pita bread with your salad, which tastes wonderfully fresh! The salad dressing is a balsamic vinaigrette that is light and tasty.
 
Their grape leaves appetizer is also another favorite with yummy seasoned meat. We usually get their salads to be healthy! Parking is sometimes difficult in the Blakeney area but we think the food is worth it and definitely fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious food.  The place is a little uncomfortable on the inside but outside is just fine.  the food is fresh.  I think the prices should it be more affordable."}
{"text":"Winner, winner, chicken dinner!

Loved it!   Fabulous chicken breast pita and the fries are fabulous.   The tzatziki was perfectly garlicky and complimented the fresh red onions and tomatoes so well.  The pita was soft and warm.   My husband, who kindly picked up for us today, had the chicken kebab.  Loved it!  Our baby ate the hummus and pita with great joy.  

We are instant fans.  So glad to have a new go-to spot in Blakeney with high quality fresh food!"}
{"text":"The food was nothing to rave about. I had the grilled chicken gyro and it was ok.  A friend ordered the Greek salad that came with one small block of feta cheese and olives that were not pitted. Not impressed, will not be going back."}
{"text":"We visited because we had a coupon from the entertainment book. This restaurant did not disappoint. The oregano and lemon fries were so good and worth the calorie splurge. The lamb for the gyros was tender, juicy, and perfectly spiced. To top it all off the employees were super nice and the food came out fast. So glad we had the coupon and tried it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered carry out here as a last minute idea. The chicken was very tasty and the menu offered up a lot of choices. My only critique is they could use a little more veggies in their salads. The container seemed too large and therefore missing in quantity. But honestly i received friendly and prompt service, and everything tasted perfect. Much better than a subway in my not so humble opinion."}
{"text":"Great little Greek grill, we eat here often and always had great food and nice staff..if you've never been I suggest trying it...we try to stop by every week as my wife and I don't cook at home often, always eat out! Thank me later!"}
{"text":"Loved the one out Rea Rd and now thrilled they are open near my house."}
{"text":"Love this place and have been here 3 times in the 1.5 weeks since we discovered it.  Excellent, fresh ingredients, friendly service and inviting prices make this a must try. We drive 20 minutes for Greco Fresh goodness....

As everyone has mentioned this place has the best gyro in town but----everything else is superb as well. All varieties of fries and the daily Greek specialties are must tries....

One request would be a beer license for an ice cold Mythos or Athena."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I bookmarked this place to try! I really could kick myself for not trying this place sooner! 

Greco's is awesome! It's a cool spot hidden in the back of the Blakeney shopping center with awesome food and super friendly employees. Sure, parking is a bit of pain but once you find a spot you are totally in for a treat! 

When I walked in there was Greek music playing and the aroma smelled simply delicious! There were two super friendly employees behind the counter and they definitely made my visit amazing!

I decided to try the chicken breast gyro and lemon and oregano fries. Holy Moly!!! The chicken was so tender and well seasoned! The pita bread was so fresh and mixed with that tzatzaki sauce....yum yum yum! There was nothing about this gyro that I didn't like! And those fries were freaking killer!! The tartness of the lemon and freshness and flavor from the oregano...two words: Simply delicious! I couldn't stop eating them!!! I only wish I had more...

I enjoyed the entire experience! My food was hot, the portion sizes were huge! And the best part of the visit, was that the employees came by and asked if my food was delicious or if I needed anything else!

I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu! This is by far some of the best Greek food in Charlotte! Totally a must try!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite takeout place in blakeney.  I love the chicken gyro, lemon oregano fries and hummus platter.  I usually order a side of tzatziki with pitas, too.  Everything is made fresh, and you can tell.  I love this place!"}
{"text":"Came for a mid week dinner with co-workers...we had a veggie pita, lamb plate and kefte platter. The kefte was yummy, seasoned wonderfully and the spicy fries were great (however, almost $12 for 2 patties and a basket of fries? Not a good value). The lamb plate looked great and she ate it all...so, must have been good. The veggie pita was very watery...dripping juice everywhere (quite a bit left uneaten, but she ate all the dolamades). I got the donut holes (forget proper name)...super yummy. No pressure to leave, we were there 2+ hours. Will definitely be back, but will order something different."}
{"text":"Authentic Greek restaurant! Very friendly staff and consistently good food.

Definitely one of the best fast-food like greek restaurants in the Charlotte area. Been there three times so far and loved it every single time.

They have outside seating as well."}
{"text":"First time we dined at Greco Fresh, it was amazing. Took friends for lunch the following weekend. Yesterday, we were sorely disappointed. 

Pita bread was delish, but the \"lamb gyro\" meat was questionable at best. Looked like a formed loaf which was served luke warm. (My teen who works at a local sandwich shop said it looks just like the \"gyro\" meat they receive frozen and reheat for their \"signature gyros\"). Whole red onion pieces, probably the ends, came off when I bit into my gyro. Not what I expect for a $26 lunch.

Skimpy on the sauce. Fries lukewarm, limp, greasy lacking flavor. Agree with the poster about folks \"lining up for gyros and Greek fries.\" No spinach pie the day we visited either.

To top it all off, each of us ate our meal the rest of the day =/ 
My teen boys do not want to return to Greco. That says it all."}
{"text":"Good gyros and  great galaktopoureko! Staff is really friendly and made for a great experience."}
{"text":"The food here is sooo good and I am very glad they opened  a third location. This small restaurant franchise is the best ever! My favorite restaurant ever and I cook at least 5 days a week for my family."}
{"text":"This is the best Greek restaurant ever the staff is so nice and the food is the best Greek food I've ever had! You NEED to come to greco fresh grille blakeney"}
{"text":"Love the food here.  Growing up near Tarpon Springs, FL, which has a very large Greek population, I am nostalgic and picky when it comes to Greek food.  That's why I was pleasantly surprised when we first discovered this place a few months ago. Ate there again tonight and had the chicken kabob with lemon oregano fries.  The kids had the same thing and scarfed it down.  We also had the hummus, which was creamy and tasty...almost a meal by itself.  I wish I had fasted to make more room.  Everything always taste really fresh and flavorful.  The staff and owner are also incredibly friendly.  Looking forward to the next trip."}
{"text":"Epic food.....we ate inside and it was a little smokey from the grill.  If I leave a place and smell like the food that usually means it's awesome.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm SUPER happy we found this little Greek spot. I have been itching to get Greek since we moved here. I have tried one other place then found Greco Fresh. 
There was 6 people in my party and we all got something different. Everyone enjoyed their food, not complaints at all. I had the Chicken Gyro which was scrumptious. The pita was perfect and the tzatziki was probably my favorite. We got the tzatziki appetizer... probably not good for my diet but well worth it. 

The staff was amazing and really friendly. The lady working behind the counter came over and chatted with us for a bit. She was so sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. The owners weren't there because they are in Greece. The restaurant was really laid back and clean. Nice place to stop in with the family. 

I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Chicken gyro combo with lemon oregano fries is the bomb. Also accept Ballantyne corporate card."}
{"text":"Considering that the wife and I live close by and love Greek food, it was shocking that it took so long for us to try this place.  I ordered a lamb burger and the wife had a lamb gyro.  The wife decided that we split the lahano salata, which is a traditional Greek salad made with cabbage, fennel, green onions and dill, if I am not mistaken.  All the food was authentic and the chef/cook came out and talked to us to see how everything was.  It was nice to try something a little different than the usual Greek food.  The service was great all around and we ordered baklava to go.

I can't wait to return and explore more of the menu next time."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon while running errands. Clean, bright, refreshing atmosphere with photos the owner actually took while in Greece. We met the owner when we had questions on one of menu items, and he was friendly and personable. The food exceeded our expectations and some of the best baklava I have ever had! For real Greek food here in Fort Mill - Greco Fresh Grille is a must!"}
{"text":"Just got take out there for first time and it was sooo good!! Im pretty sure it was the owner who took our order and he was super friendly and helpful.  He described the two hummus flavors in detail to help me decide.  I had the vegetarian gyro and I was so excited to see the option for a whole wheat pita!!  my friend had the chicken gyro and She even had chicken leftover after the gyro was gone so they definitely don't skimp.  So delicious.  Will be back often. :)"}
{"text":"Great Greek salads, chicken gyros and kabobs. Fresh shrimp. Love that it is locally owned. Will be back."}
{"text":"Been here ten times already. Great food. Great service. Great owners. Chicken on point. Gyro amazing. Falafel to die for and the tzatziki you will want extra of. So glad great food has arrived to fort mill."}
{"text":"Finally ventured into this little Blakeney gem. My wife had been before and had great things to say so, needless to say, we were long overdue. 

Resting amongst more attractive and simple options for suburban folk, I'm happy to say Greco Fresh Grille is local-biz lover's haven. 

Small, shotgun setup on the inside and a handful of tables out back. The outdoor seating is great, but goes quite fast if it's a nice day. Get at it quick! Always nice to see filled tables at an off hour. Telltale sign this place is doing something right. 

Friendly service behind the counter. Welcoming and helpful. 

Here's our order: 

Got cups for water. They have pepsi products. (No hard feelings. I'm just a coke guy through and through. I'll make an exception for Cheerwine, however. Viva NC)

Spinach Pie. To the Greek-savvy, Spanakopita. Amazing. The phyllo is perfectly crispy, flaky and crunches/dissolves with each bite. The spinach filling is savory and not too rich and creamy. Comes with 6 pieces, so perfect for a table of two. If you're sharing with more than two, you'll have to fight for more than one piece! I'd get this every time. 

My wife got the veggie gyro. Great mix of roasted red peppers, cucumber, red onion and great tzatziki. I'm a fan. The pita is thick and chewy, but not offensively so. I'd be hard pressed to shove a few pieces of the spinach pie in this bad boy! Loved all of the textures and flavors. Not overpowering and a great veggie option. 

I got the lamp gyro. Voted best in the QC by the Observer. I say rightfully so. Generous helping of lamb, balanced well with fresh veggies and, yet again, a nice slather of that great tzatziki. Each bite was great and I was only disappointed once it was gone. 

Prices are very reasonable. We ate for $20 and were happily full!

Parking can be an issue, as there aren't many spaces directly in front of the shop. Not uncommon for Blakeney spots. I'd park over near the Starbucks. 

Can't wait to head back and stuff my face with more Greek food. Opa!

Cheers."}
{"text":"Excellent food but experience ruined by staff cleaning floor while I was eat 20 mins before closing. The bleach smell ruined the food aroma and the kids working were clearly just trying to close early vs. offering good customer service. The phone rang 10x before someone answered -staring at the phone saying I will answer if they keep calling- they didn't want to make more food close to closing time. They locked the front door 10 mins before closing as well. I'm writing this bc if I were management I would want to know what my employees are doing when I'm not looking. Hopefully you can hire more customer focused staff."}
{"text":"The best Greek salad ever. The freshest salad I've had. Always good. Love the outdoor seating. Great service."}
{"text":"I asked the cashier for recommendation as this was my first time here.  Lamb gyro was good, but i should have skipped the lemon seasoned fries - they were cold.  I will come back another time and reevaluate my 3-star grade."}
{"text":"Very convenient to my home and work.
I am Greek and was so excited to see this open up.
The food was good... except I was upset that the teenage girl behind the counter told me the baklava was homemade... my whole family was disappointed with the obviously store boughten baklava. I would've preferred that she told me the truth so I didn't waste my money.
I'll probably be back one day...., but not for the baklava."}
{"text":"Very good healthy alternative for here in Tega Cay. Lots of flavor and the hummus is on point. 

The fries... oh my goodness the fries :)"}
{"text":"Tucked away in Blakeney is this fantastic little casual family run Greek restaurant.  My wife and I just love to come here for lunch.  It's cozy and cheerful and has the best tasting food in the area (and it's an area with really good casual dining options).

We just love the  chicken kabobs are tender, delicious, and perfectly cooked.  The seasoned fries are some of the best fries in town, and we just love their hummus, especially the flavored varieties.  

Today we were fortunate enough to try the Greek custard--a warm treat sheathed in phyllo dough--to top off our meal.  It is flavored with a hint of orange zest and was scrumtious.

Portions are generous, the prices modest, and the service is terrific.  Everything we have tried at Greco Fresh is fresh and tasty.  We love this place!"}
{"text":"Yum, the best Greek chicken pita around!  I either eat chicken or vegetarian, so I can only speak to those items.  The greek salad was fresh and filling.  The lemon fries are too die for, but trying to eat healthier, so I have cut back on those..even though they are tempting....the baklava is to DIE FOR!  Cinnamon flavor, not overly sweet.  If you haven't been here, you must try it!!"}
{"text":"The food has always been amazing! The workers and the owner are all always great!  Since it's opened it's been one of my favorite restaurants and it's the only reason I like Greek food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly service! Stopped by for an early dinner today and got the chicken platter. It came with a delicious Greek salad and was plenty of food, enough to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow! John was super friendly and quick!"}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick meal. The food is reliably good. My favorite is the traditional gyro with lemon oregano fries. You can also switch out the pita for a lettuce wrap, which I have done and enjoyed. My family regularly orders the salmon pita, Greek salad, and chicken kabobs. There are options of flavors available for hummus (and fries!). I've tried both the rice pilaf and chickpea salad, and I would not order those again. 


The restaurant is clean, and there is seating available outside. All of the workers are all very nice. Parking is rarely an issue."}
{"text":"Employees are friendly and helpful so that's good. 

However, I have had A LOT of Mediterranean food in my life, and this place falls short of the other comparable food taste I have experienced. Although everything is fresh and hot, the taste is not that flavorful and the portion sizes are smaller than other Mediterranean places I have been to like Kabob Grill, Troy or La Shish. 

 I have friends that are Arab and from the Mediterranean region so I know this cuisine pretty well, and I can say that I don't find the taste to be as authentic as my friends foods that I have had or other restaurant places I have tried. 

I'm not saying the place is bad, just not great."}
{"text":"I'm so surprised I haven't reviewed Greco Fresh Grille yet!  It's a favorite spot for quick, fresh food. 

My favorite is the the Lahano Salata with Grilled Chicken. It's shredded cabbage with arugula and green onions tossed with a yummy lemon dressing.  My description probably didn't give it justice but it's so good and it's nothing like coleslaw. I do recommend adding a protein, either the chicken or shrimp to elevate it to a meal.  It also comes with pita bread on the side.

My hubby usually gets the shrimp pita - it's so good!  The best part of his pita that you can make it a combo and get lemon & oregano fries!  It's an expectation for him to share his fries with me. 

I admit that I tend to order the same thing but I will venture out one day and order the lamb burger, it sounds so good. 

The service is always very friendly and attentive - especially with the quick service format.  You order at the register,  they give you a number and they'll bring your food to you.  Try it, I'm sure you'll like it."}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is friendly 
I like this place and the spicy fries ugh begging my bf to not take me there again or I'll eat the whole place up"}
{"text":"Lately I have been craving Greek food and trying to find a good place that has flavorful twist to traditional Greek food. A cousin of mine told me about this place so we went and checked it out. It is located in South Charlotte, in the Blakeney shopping center. I got the grilled chicken breast gyro with cumin and garlic fries. They also offer lemon oregano fries and plain fries. The chicken is flavored well and grilled well. The chicken had a hint of lemon to it as well which mixed well with the tzatziki sauce. Inside the gyro is long cut onions, tomatoes, lettuce, tzatziki sauce and chicken. The gyro is basic and there isn't anything unique about the dish until you get to the fries. This is the first time I have ever had cumin and garlic fries. My one concern about the fries was that there was going to be too much garlic. When I bit into the fries I was very surprised, the flavors of the cumin and garlic went very well together. The garlic was not over bearing at all and I would say I was very impressed with the fries. For about $8 to $9 you can have a chicken gyro and a very generous portion of fries. I have been back and I would go back again."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and go here as fast as you can!!! The owner was very sweet, we told him it was our first time here. He asked if we had any questions. I told home no and we ordered. He laughed and said you guys are ordering a little bit of everything! Well yes we did and hell yes we ate it all! Coming from hickory and not knowing when we'd be back we wanted our Greek experience!

About the food! It's amazing I got the gyro platter. 
The salad was so fresh and I love the dressing and the feta! So freaking good! 
The pita was perfectly warm, the meat was juicy and delicious. 
The tzatziki was out of this world, you could put that on anything and I'd eat it! Don't even get me started on those fries, those things are to die for! 
My husband also got some hummus, I don't really care for hummus so I barely tasted it, but he absolutely loved it. 

The only thing that would make this place better is if they would come to hickory! I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life!"}
{"text":"My husband , daughter and I were at AT&T yesterday and awfully hungry. We searched yelp of course to see what was available food wise and saw this place and it wasn't long ago we were craving some gyros with lamb.   This Place Is A Bit Small . It felt cramped with it not busy I would not want to experience it busy. We ordered 3 traditional gyros garlic cumin french fries, and lemon oregano french fries. Service was quick. We were sitting outside. And we were amazed at how phenom this food was.   The tzatziki sauce tasted identical to my homemade one. Everything was prepared in the least messy way.  And the French fries were out of this world like we've never tasted before.   We bragged about this food the entire way home and we are looking forward to going back soon"}
{"text":"Being Greek, I've had my share of Greek food here and back in greece. I think this place has above and beyond gyro sammiches. The tzajiki is perfect. I always get a mezze platter. I a great helping of hummus, feta, olives, dolmades and tzajiki. It's just wonderful. I also like,the Greek fries when I eat in. This small chain is worth visiting.   It reminds me of gyros I had in greece."}
{"text":"Food was good. Owner was super friendly. Great service and atmosphere. I would highly recommend visiting this resturant.  The giro was great! Salad was great!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and decent atmosphere. The chicken kabobs tasted like rubber unfortunately."}
{"text":"Love this place! Casual and really kid friendly! Fresh cut fries~ Lemon oregano are ROCKIN'. Great quality ingredients, no skimping. The staff is friendly and helpful. The owner is usually there and always has a smile on his face. I love their salads and the kids really dig the chicken kabobs. We tried another greek place, near Earth Fare in South Charlotte...it did not come close to Greco!
We keep coming back for the great food and the everyone's friendly attitude. SOLID casual and soooo good!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. Great place to eat if you are lazy to cook and want some Mediterranean food. Go for the falafel. It could be one of the most affordable and filling food you've ever eaten."}
{"text":"The Lamb Gyro is the best I've ever had.  The meat has so much flavor and is seasoned so well.  The Tzaziki sauce is truly authentic tasting.  I have never been to Greece but I have a good friend who is from Greece and even she agreed that it was very authentic.  The fried are good.  I personally prefer the lemon Oregano but I've heard good things about the Cumin ones too.  The nicest part is seeing the owner in there hands on working hard to make his business a success."}
{"text":"I don't have a lot of time to go on and on about how great this place is. It's great! The food is always very fresh and I love how the owners actually work there. The couple that runs the place is very caring that the food is always high quality. Worth trying if you like to eat healthy, fresh food."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. Traditional salad was large and the dressing was nicely seasoned and not too oily.  The olives and feta were great  The cheese and spinach triangles were good, but the spinach was a little over cooked and there wasn't much cheese.
The lamb was good and tender.  Friendly and helpful service."}
{"text":"One of, if not the best gyros in town. Service is always top notch and the food is great. My go to lunch spot in the Blakeney/Ballantyne area."}
{"text":"So good I visited the Wesley Chapel location too.  The Ballantyne location is a little hole in the wall next to Coldstone.  Oh is it tasty.  Just great salad w/that olive oil pinch of salt & traditional gyro all the way.  We've been back 2x in the last week."}
{"text":"5.95 for a gyro? I'll have like four please.. to feed myself.

Greco isn't the most high-end, upscale restaurant on the inside, but you really shouldn't judge this little book by its cover.  The food and service is definitely A+. 

The food at Greco is cheap cheap cheap but doesn't taste like it at all.  The best part of the meal is paying 3.00$ extra for Lemon-Oregano fries and a drink.  Getting an entree + fries + drink is a little too much food for just one person honestly so if you're looking to just be 'full' when you leave instead of 'super stuffed', maybe share the fries with a friend?  

Lastly, they have baklava that's the size of my entire hand.  The baklava I've had before was the same price and literally the size of a quarter (but I kept paying for it because it was sooooo good).  Thank goodness I've found a better alternative in this wonderful little place."}
{"text":"YUM!  Fresh is indeed the word for this place, what a delightful stop for a quick dinner.  The owner asked if it was my first time, how I had heard about them, etc. and I told him that I had seen some glowing reviews on Yelp and had to try it out for myself.  He laughed and said when the Yelpers like you, you're in good and when they don't it's not good.  :)  Such a charmer, excellent first impression, but I had to try the food.

As the other reviews have stated, Greco Fresh Grille is located at Blakeney along the restaurant row portion on the far end.  Parking - meh.  Directly in front of the restaurant is 15 minute parking, so swing on past that towards Bath and Body and Wells Fargo and you should have some luck.  At 5:30 on a Monday, I was a little ahead of the dinner rush, but as I was finishing, folks started to pour in.  I am glad I got there early, as I got a chance to speak with the owner.  

The food:
Grilled chicken gyro:  well seasoned white meat served on a warm pita with tzatziki (totally had to look that up) sauce, thinly sliced onions and tomatoes.  Delish!  It tasted bright and fresh, very good.  
The fries:  I ordered the lemon with oregano fries (the owner said if you are getting fries to go, the plain or garlic/cumin is suggested as the lemon that is tossed with the fries can make them a tad soggy if you aren't going to eat them soon).  I liked them - different, tasty.  But he was kind enough to send over a sample of the garlic/cumin fries and they were AWESOME.  I like crispy (burned) fries, and these were perfect.  Lightly seasoned and such a tasty change from plain old salt.  Quite good!
As Ben stated, they have the Pepsi (sigh), but they do have Cheerwine - YAY!

Awesome Greek music playing, but not loud or obtrusive at all.  If I had any friends to eat with, we could have easily carried on a conversation.  There is a TV that was on the Cooking channel when I was in with subtitles.  

Friendly tip - your breath is going to be WHEEEEYEW from all of the deliciousness, so I wouldn't do this for a first date (or third, *wink*) or before a trip to your dentist (unless you hate your dentist), but any other time would be fabulous.

Great little spot, the owner and his staff are incredible and definitely made a great impression.  Come for the friendliness, stay for the food, I can't wait to go back and try some more food."}
{"text":"Love this place! (I personally like it more than Showmars) their lemon-oregano fries are on point and I always get their chicken pita! It's so good that I never really branch out and try something new there :)"}
{"text":"Better than the gyro at the Greek festival in Charlotte. Love this place. We usually call in and take out but have sat inside once or twice. It's more quick and eat than sit down restaurant. However the inside is in good condition. They are always quick to complete the order."}
{"text":"Was in the fort mill area and was looking for restaurants for lunch.  I am sucker for Mediterranean food,  and found Greco to be minutes away from where we were.  So, let's try it!!
Ordered Chicken Gyro, Grilled Chicken Kebobs and the devilishly deliciously looking Baklava that was just then refilled on the front counter.  Got our number card, found a table around the corner and the wait starts.  Either our food was late or we were so hungry even minutes felt like hours, lol.  Well, the restaurant was crowded so can't complain on the way, but we were hungry too.
My chicken gyro was delicious, just awesome, enjoyed every bite of it.  The tzatziki sauce was just delicious and fresh, chicken was perfectly cooked and spices was just on point.
Grilled chicken kebobs was only OK, not great.  Agreed its kebobs, its usually dry but ours was dry and a little hard as well.  The rice that was chosen as a side was very bland no spices or herbs which would enhance rice's flavor.  For 11 bucks we were expecting a better tasting chicken kebobs.
Finale - Baklava. That's it.  Everything was forgiven. That was one big, flaky, nutty, warm, sweetttttttt, super delicious baklava we ever had. LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Truly a Greek cafe.  I could think of other names, but fresh Greek grill are the action search words.  From appetizer, through salads and onward into plates and meal you will find well put together meals.

All the traditional Greek eaten by hand items like Dolmades, gyros, kabobs, pitas, falafels and burgers of which one is a lamb burger.  These hand eaten items can come as platters so need to be consumed sitting down.  Spinach pie and humus come to mind.

 It is very clean and the staff friendly and helpful.  Portions are reasonable.

The location is in the Harris-Teeter shopping center which also contains Brooklyn Pizza, a Japanese place, Mexican place, Chinese restaurant and others, so if you are looking for something different and good, give the Greek place, ie. Greco Fresh Grill a try.  

I think that all of their offering are good, even thought I have not eaten all they have, but I have eaten enough of a variety to make that leap of opinion."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to see that La Fornarina had closed recently. However, I was happy to see that Greco Fresh Grille was opening in its place. We have been going to the one in Blakeney for years. 

I stopped in this new location and the owner Nick was working the register. They definitely changed the decor from the previous incarnations and it no longer feels like a Donato's, which was the original business that occupied this space. It's quick serve casual but they have a lot of options including vegetarian, salads, gyros and more. Nick was working the register and despite the place being busy, the staff was handling it. I ordered two mezze platters to go. They include a little bit of everything. The food was really good. The only negative is that I ordered the large piece of kefte (kind of like a Mediterranean meatloaf) but I received the half portion. It wasn't a huge deal because it was still good and the platters have a good amount of food anyway.

It is nice to finally have some decent Greek food in Fort Mill/Tega Cay. It's even better that it is cheap, fast and good."}
{"text":"I was somewhat saving this for my 200th review as I wanted it to be a write-up about something good.  Greco's Fresh Grill in the Blakeney area near Rea Rd and Ardrey Kell Roads is one of the best places in the area to go for fresh, quick, and reasonably priced, mostly authentic Greek food.  

It is counter service.  Peruse the menu above the grills and sneezeguards, then order what you'd like and they'll bring it to your table. Lamb gyros, chicken gyros, vegetarian stuffed grape leaves, lemon oregano fries, etc..  I have had the chicken gyro, the plain hummus, and the lemon oregano fries.  The gyro is delicious; they do not skimp on the chicken, and there is a lot of seasoning and oil on it.  Do NOT remove it from the foil lest you would like oil dripping all over you.  The hummus is probably the best I have had around here.  It's very fresh and there are no fillers in it.  The menu states \"If it's harder to pronounce than a Greek last name, then you shouldn't be eating it.\".  The lemon oregano fries are decent.  They are not necessarily my flavor preference, but they are good for what they are.

The people working, from the Greek cooks/owners, to the teenage girls usually running the register, are all very friendly.  So if you want a good, fresh gyro at a fair price in south Charlotte, Greco's is the place to go."}
{"text":"I'll go ahead and reiterate what everyone has already said, this place is fantastic. There isn't anything I can even think of to nitpick, their ingredients are fresh, consistent, and certainly filling. 

The gyros are awesome, the lamb is juicy and well seasoned, the tzatziki is creamy, and the onions are nice and crisp. The baklava is fresh and flaky as well. As good as their sandwiches are, the fries are even better. Probably top five I've ever had, and some of the best seasoned. I've ordered a couple orders of their fries in different flavors for parties and it's always a crowd-pleaser. In a neighborhood full of choices to eat, this is one of favorites in Blakeney/Stonecrest area."}
{"text":"The Good: it is close and predominantly fresh.   The dolmades and spanakopita are both solid efforts.   The rest is unfortunately bland.  The chicken platter is sliced dry chicken - I'm hoping the kebab is better.   The rice pilaf lacks the saffron or normal Greek seasoning.  The hummus is good but could use more tahini - also slightly dry and lacking good flavor.   I'd come again but I hope the other offerings improve my impression of the place - otherwise convenient Greek food is its best angle.  Jasmine and Mad Greek on South Blvd and Zeoutoni in Ballentyne all offer far superior Greek food."}
{"text":"Love the lemon oregano fries!!! The gyros are pretty good they just don't give as much meat as the competition thus the 4 stars."}
{"text":"The Greek dishes at this restaurant is on point! The prices are really reasonable for the amount of food they give you, with friendly and welcoming staff.

Will definitely stop by whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"What a sunny, pleasant little place! Have eaten here several times and have been satisfied with food, service and atmosphere each time. The dining area has white booths and lots of natural light. You order at the counter and find a booth on your own.

My wife and I have gone simple each time though, choosing gyros, humus and lemon-oregano fries from their menu options which include all the usual Greek fare. The gyros are tasty, but in all honesty, just average to good when compared to the competition which has suddenly flooded into the south Charlotte area. The lemon-oregano fries tend to be a little wet but are still very good. The salads are large and flavorful. As far as the pitas and humus go, we've been spoiled by a couple of competitors that serve up freshly baked bread continually. 

Overall, we like it and will be back (especially with a coupon)."}
{"text":"This is a very good little Greek joint amid a throng of chain restaurants in the very popular south Charlotte shopping area known as Blakeney. As locals, my wife and I know to avoid this area at dinnertime due to the crowds and stick to lunches only. Parking is an issue almost anytime but especially after 6:00pm. The fact that it is dominated almost exclusively by chains can make dining in this area somewhat ho-hum which makes Greco Fresh Grille refreshing and appealing. It does have two other Charlotte locations but doesn't feel like a chain, in fact, it is family run and that is reflected in its quality and service. The inside eating area is small and narrow but it does have a fantastic outside area.

I've eaten here a dozen times or so and always get the traditional Gyro with Lemon Pepper fries and have found both to be very satisfying. One oddity however that I didn't notice until I ate at the Colony Road location is that (as some reviews have noted) the Lemon Pepper fries served here are served somewhat soggy with sauce compared to the other location. I like the less soggy type and go now to Colony Road location solely for this reason. The manager insists they are prepared the same way so you'll have to check for yourself but I assure you there is a difference. (I'm not about to argue with a Greek restaurant owner.) Either way they are a must and the serving size is huge.

The fact that I eat here so regularly alone should imply that I think it's pretty good. We are suddenly blessed by plethora of Greek/Mediterranean choices in south Charlotte and I'd rate this among the best."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and food. I think the chicken group was better than the salmon one. The fries were wonderful and multiple seasoning options!!! 

The man, who I think was the owner was super kind and friendly. Will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal and serves authentic greek food. The lamb gyros are hearty and will satisfy even the hungriest of eaters. The Pita's are super fresh and the tzatziki is creamy, garlicy and tangy. Highly recommend the greek salads which come with large chucks of veggies and feta cheese. The baklava is also excellent. I havn't tried the lamb burger yet or the garlic oregano fries but I hear those are great too.

This is my new goto Greek joint in South Charlotte."}
{"text":"It's so nice to have Greek food in Ft. Mill. Everything I've tried there is delicious and fresh tasting.  The lamb is excellent, and the fries are good as well. Will certainly be there again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and I'm super indifferent. First I had the traditional gyro and the lemon oregano fries. Solid lunch on a Friday. I returned last week for a lamb special platter which included, 5-6 small strips of lamb (gyro), a side Greek salad, rice pilaf and warm pita bread. For a price tag of almost $12 I do not feel the portions are substantial for dinner, although the food is quite tasty and authentic. I will probably return as it is in my neighborhood but when I'm looking for a more hearty meal, I may drive a little further out for a similar cuisine."}
{"text":"Outstanding food at a good price. I've tried it all- everything is good. I recommend the chicken, lamb, or kefte gyro. The fries are delicious.

If you have any questions or concerns John will be more than happy to help you out."}
{"text":"Even though its not fancy I'm giving this place 5 stars because everything is fresh and done perfectly each time. It's also cheap and very clean. Yes it's not fancy but, so what? It's great, simple Greek food. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great service, nice casual atmosphere.  Food is consistently ok but not great.  Falafel is too dense and low on flavor.  Burger is very hard and dry, need to add some moisture to the meat with fat or grind some veggies into it (mushroom works well), also needs some seasonings"}
{"text":"Firstly, love that it's privately owned and the owners are friendly and always here.. Wonderful gentlemen. Besides that the food is fantastic, gyros are perfect... Homemade baklava was fresh out of the oven!!! Puts all other baklava to shame! Greek salad is a delight... Best lunch in Blakeny :)"}
{"text":"Simple Menu!  All the Meats and the Tzatziki are Exceptional!  The Pita Bread is Amazing!  This is my Favorite Greek and Favorite place for a Wrap!

First I had the Lamb Gyro and Fries.  The Gyro was Fantastic - Great Pita Bread, Red Onion, No lettuce (nice touch), Tomato and Tzatziki!  They have an \"Open Kitchen\" which I think always puts the customers at ease!

The fries are not what I like, (I'm real picky about fries, if you see my very short \"Fries\" list) and what does it matter, though they are fresh (Not frozen)!  The Salad dressing was good, not great (I'm very picky about EVERYTHING!!!)!

Then I had the Chicken Gyro with two sides of Tzatziki. Excellent!  The music was soft Greek sounding, relaxing, great dining music!  The Decor is Greek: Blue and White.  Very comfortable environment!

The service was Outstanding!  Superb!  Top Notch!!! Fast and Friendly!  Had lunch there today and they were busy and handling it with Skill!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastik!  Beats the jopps off of the Greek Competition and Competes well with ALL Mediterranean Nations represented in the Area AND that is NOT an easy thing!  Believe me, I used to live here and I used to live only a mile from this spot!

{"text":"Authentic. Fast. Quality was delivered. Awesome food with optional kids plates. I can't wait to eat there again. Bring your appetite, everything on the menu sounds fantastic and the aroma is mouthwatering."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Greco regularly for 3 years now and have been delighted during each visit.
My kids loooove their chicken skewers with the tasting Greek seasoning. (They beg me to take them there).
You can't leave without indulging in the lemon oregano fries. I dare to say they are the best fries in the state! Only get one order for the table though; as the portion is ample and you WILL clean your plate.
The tzatiki is so creamy and light...I always get extras.
Mmmmmm, I am hungry remembering the lamb burger on pita; wow...I call that happiness on a plate.
Greek salad and shrimp pita are just some of my other favorites.
Oh, I almost forgot the prices are so reasonable for the quality and if you want extra tzatiki, they don't nickel and dime you; they happily give you more with a smile.
And they are family owned; very nice people.
Gotta go; I need me some Greco love."}
{"text":"Always good food and excellent service.  They really care about their customers and go the extra mile.  Love the falafel, lemon Basil frys, and gyro.  All their food is awesome and fresh!"}
{"text":"Mr. H says he liked their Gyro best in Charlotte area, to date.  Mrs. H., a french-fry fanatic, enjoyed their plain fries the best.  (She tried plain and lemon-herb, side-by-side).  The hummus is a decent, home-made variety, but is on the pasty side.

One down-fall, this place uses a \"Wonder Bread\" version of a pita bread.  It's no-where near authentic, and it's pretty dough-y.  That, by itself, drops from 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Lamb gyro and cumin & garlic fries were awesome. Didn't have room for baklava, but it looked yummy. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Good healthy choices at good prices and nice fast service. Nick the owner is always so friendly and knows his regulars!"}
{"text":"The best Greek place in town!!! The chicken gyro is my favorite with a side of fries flavored with Rosemary and lemon zest.

Treat yourself to a bakalava for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food has sadly Americanized, too much success too soon?
I've been back a few times  - not as often as I'd like because 22 miles is a long round trip for a Gyro - the fun has been going down but today, finally was just a big disappointing. 

They no longer offer the delicious Melitzonasalata, I was told because locals are not interested. Galaktompureko sorry no we don't have any, I didn't see any spinach pie ... it's pretty much down to people lining up for Gyro and \"Greek\" fries. 

Even the gyro (which is still good) is not what it used to be - more grease, less flavor ... is that pressed lamb meat? Not the same.

I brought home the Lahano salad, which turned out to be nothing but shredded cabbage with a tiny bit of Arugula, essentially $7 for a plate of slaw. Studying the menu after the fact I see I was supposed to spend an  additional $3-$4 for chicken or some other protein on top, Greek salad? I think not.  

If enough people notice maybe the owners will raise their standards but I won't be holding my breath."}
{"text":"Very good Greek food. Probably the best in the area (South Charlotte). I had the traditional gyro. My wife had the chicken gyro. Both were excellent. Employees are awesome. Friendly and quick.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I come for the fries. Some of the best pub style fries in Charlotte. Different hummus every day. Generous portions. WiFi is password protected but they'll happily give you the current password at the register."}
{"text":"Yes! The lamb in the gyro is so good. Pairs nicely with fresh toppings and zippy tzatziki."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in Charlotte!Amazing and inexpensive! The chicken is so good and delicious. Great gyros. You can't go wrong or over order."}
{"text":"They do an unbelievable job here . Can't belie it took me 2 years to give it a try. All the reviews are spot on. Traditional Gyro, cumin garlic fries,, make you wanna slap your momma!  Great job guys keep it up.  Owner is awesome and make sure you are satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"Five Guys doesn't sit well with me after I eat it, so whenever my friends go there, I go next door to Greco and we eat outside at a connected patio.  

I've never had a bad experience here.  It's as simple as can be -- you look at their huge menu as you walk in, order at the counter, and they bring their food to you.  There are pretty good options, although I always get one of their Gyros.  I prefer Chicken to Traditional (lamb), but both are good.  Also, you can make it a combo for about $3 extra. I've gotten their hummus and pita, which was delicious, but I really dig their fries.  They've got 4 flavors -- lemon oregano, cumin and garlic, sea salt, and spicy.  My favorite?  The spicy.  I really want to try their grape leaves next time.

I could go on about the food, but their service is fantastic too.  They're friendly, make good recommendations and serve you with smiles on their faces.  All this makes for a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Addicting ! Always fresh and delicious. Friendly service. Clean restaurant. My favorite is the shrimp pita with fries. Several hummus flavors to choose from. Fries are delicious. Some of the best I've had in charlotte. Healthy food choices."}
{"text":"Walked in on a weekday afternoon to give this place a second try. I ordered a meal that came with one chicken kebab and fries. My order was to-go and when I opened the box to eat my good, I was quite disappointed to taste the bed of fries to be all burnt. These were surely the worst fries i have ever had in my life. Not sure how this place gets an award for the best fries. If it were to me I would give them the award for the worst and burnt fries."}
{"text":"This is located in the Blakeney shopping center. Ordered the chicken gyro combo, comes with drink and fries for $2.75 more, I think. The gyro is always packed with chicken and really flavorful with the tzatziki sauce. I get the lemon and oregano fries; also yummy. Nice people, good food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Great Greek food with a great price point! Don't ever choose Shomars over this place. I've pretty much tried every pita and have never been disappointed. I was surprised how juicy and flavorful their gyro was--not dry at all. The same can be said about their chicken and salmon. I honestly think their shrimp is much better than some seafood restaurants. I've gone to many places where the shrimp was over cooked and rubbery, but that is not the case here. Their portion sizes are pretty big, and their small fries can feed 2-3 people. Come hungry or you'll be leaving with leftovers. 

Not to mention, their staff is friendlu and really helpful if you don't know what to get. John suggested for me to try several new dishes and I was happy with what I got!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a late lunch early dinner. The Mezza Platter is ample with soft warm pita, hummus,tzatziku dip, feta olives dolmades and spinach pie. Paired with a relaxing tall glass of Cabernet it hit the spot on a late Friday afternoon. No frills, just good food at Greco Fresh!"}
{"text":"Always a good spot to grab some Greek lunch including gyros & hummus but I like the veggie pita as well. Friendly staff.. Try it out if you want some different from burgers or tacos; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food, always awesome customer service, and the restaurant is immaculately clean. The best place in town for great quality, fresh, and healthy food. I have tried a lot of different things on the menu, and I can't complain about a single dish, everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Delicious. 
I always forget about this place but once I remember I want it for like 4 days straight :) 
Hummus is amazing 
Gyro is amazing 
Chicken is amazing 
Spicy fries amazing 
Yum yum oh and adorable"}
{"text":"Went to Greco for a quick lunch after school today. Walking in, you notice the sleek decor paired with older Greek decorations. It's an interesting vibe they create, but they pull it off pretty well. I ordered the grilled chicken gyro. We sat outside, and our food was out in about ten minutes. My chicken was very very good. Fresh, and not chewy at all. Probably some of the best chicken I've had. The tzatziki was fresh and delicious, and the onions and tomatoes complimented the whole thing. The pita was also very good.

Service was fine, really not enough interaction to judge anything. Overall, if I was in a bind for time, I'd go again!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Outside seating is not well planned. Blocked the entrance to the restaurant. Inside the restaurant you can't breathe for the cooking smoke. Really need a better exhaust system for kitchen."}
{"text":"If there was a 3 1/2 star option, I would choose it. Nice people, prompt service, reasonable prices. Have had chicken kabobs the last three times and unfortunately the chicken can either be great or completely rubbery which, for $10, is a pretty big bummer. Not sure if this is about the quality of chicken they buy or the way it is cooked. Would love for them to figure this out, because I would come more regularly. Greek salad is great."}
{"text":"This place is a must try. The food and service are excellent every trip. We brought our dog with us today to sit outside and the staff immediately brought a water bowl and some treats for her. They are very pet friendly so that is a big plus! We always get the gyros and they never disappoint. I like these better than Showmars and that is saying something. As for sides, the lemon oregano fries are stellar as well as the loukamades. 

If you haven't been you must stop here to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"Lemon-oregano fries! Their fries are our favorite fries in Charlotte! But eat them there, they'll get soggy if you try to take them with you. Love the gyros too. Next time I'm trying the lamb burger."}
{"text":"Delicious and great price! Definitely a nice option in an otherwise expensive shopping center"}
{"text":"Yay for Yelp! Was looking for a reasonably priced non-chain and Yelp told me to go here. I did what most of you suggested and got the simple lam gyro and lemon oregano fries combo. About $10 for the combo, which was a little more than I wanted to spend, but it was delicious. The tzatziki sauce with the fries were SO GOOD. Definitely homemade sauce. The gyro tasted really fresh and the lamb was obviously cooked fresh too. I personally like a little feta on my gyro, but that's alright...it may not be traditional Greek to have feta. Nevertheless, high recommended! Will go back soon for sure!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, NC  today we stopped at Greco Fresh Grille. Oh my goodness! The BEST Traditional Gyro I have had.  Flavorful, tender, juicy and the greatest Tzatziki sauce. Family owned. And I must say, a great friendly family they are. We must go back before our trip ends."}
{"text":"Came here on a road trip down from Greensboro. The owner of the place took our order and was incredibly nice. I ordered the Traditional Gyro and my mom the Falafel. 

The gyro was amazing. Everything you want in a lamb gyro, amazingly cooked and they did not skimp on the lamb!

The Falafel was beyond words. I've had Falafel all over the world and this somehow surpassed all of them. 

The owner came over to check on us, and when we told him how amazing it was he told us the secret to making a great Falafel. All in all, amazing staff, amazing food, and amazing experience. There's no way to disappoint here."}
{"text":"Very very good GREEK restaurant and owner is from Greece so knows how it should really taste without the typical pure grease gyros you get at other places. This isn't a fair ground this is great quality GREEK food. Love it - the aura of the place is great too very clean and love the music playing! Five stars!"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to Greco and this review is based on both visits.  Both times I had a regular Gyro and hand-cut fries with lemon and oregano.  

First off the gyro is very tasty and filling.  Good portion of lamb and the house-made Tzatziki is perfect.  No complaints there.  

Unfortunately, the hand-cut fries are terrible.  The first time I ordered them I thought I just caught them at a bad time.  But the second time they tasted exactly the same:  like little pieces of soggy, limp cardboard sprinkled with some oregano and a hint of lemon.    

Hand-cut fries take commitment and time to prepare.  After cutting they need to be soaked for hours otherwise they will be limp and soggy.  Then you've got to fry them twice... once after removing from the water and again when they are ordered.  

If you're not up to the task to prepare hand-cut fries properly just serve a good quality frozen fry and stick to what you're good at."}
{"text":"Lost a dedicated customs today. My aunt ordered food for me brought it home and it  was wrong when I called to tell them...the manager was so rude.  No problem I love the food but I won't come back.   She raves about the place...can't deal with attitude"}
{"text":"Restaurant motto of their Greek Food, fast, fresh, delicious seems to fit the bill of fare.
My dining  mate and I ordered the traditional Greek Salad with  added felafel. Tzadiki sauce was offered at 50 cents additional . Salads came in full or side salad sizes, $6.95/ $3.95
 Proteins are $3-$4  additional.  The menu also featured gyros, pitas, side items as spinach pie, grape leaves, hummus, kids menu and sweets such as baklava, fried honey balls, custard dessert encased in phyllo etc.
 Lamb or Angus burgers on the menu too and  menu prices reasonable.
The pita bread that came with our salad was soft, warm and fresh and obviously not microwave?d  as it remained soft.
The felafel were good, crunchIy on the outside but a bit dry inside  in our opinion. All the vegetable salad  ingredients were fresh and tasty.
One ordered at the counter, and food brought to the table.
The restaurant appeared clean and neat but decor a bit bland.
The staff seemed friendly and attentive. I would return and try another menu item. My dining mate had eaten there before, said his chicken gyro was very tasty but surprisingly  small"}
{"text":"Greco is our go-to place when we need a great salad and a glass of wine. The food is great (salad's, Gyro's and platter) and the atmosphere is nice. Overall a great place with food that is much better than Shomars and Zoes Kitchen in Rivergate."}
{"text":"First of all, the staff here is amazing! They accommodated our big group nicely.  Food was also good, a nice change for the Fort Mill/Tega Cay area. Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Today my friend, Virginia, and I decided to try this little Greek spot on the corner of Rea and Colony.  It was light and bright and had a friendly staff of people.  My chicken kabob and hand cut fries came in a blue plastic basket, almost what you would expect to find in a fish camp.  At best, the food was very average.  The chicken was a bit chewy and the fries were heavily salted and greasy.  I guess some would say that's how fries SHOULD BE!   Although I didn't try the hummus, they were offering a lot of different flavors that looked very appetizing.  One in particular was the chipotle hummus.  I probably should have substituted that instead of the fries.   It's always harder to make a food selection while you're standing at a counter and trying to order. I prefer a sit down place with a menu and a server.    Competition is becoming really robust in Charlotte with Mediterranean food.   There seems to be one of these restaurants on every corner now.  With Yafo, Cava, and the Jasmine Grill  setting very high standards, smaller places like this really need to step it up to stay in the game.  I suspect they have a loyal following, based on their neighborhood location.  And, I salute them for bringing something other than than another ho hum burger joint or chain restaurant to this part of town."}
{"text":"Delicious Lamb gyros! I wish they automatically put romaine lettuce on them.  They put feta on it but not romaine lettuce which most place is vice versa.  The lamb is super tender and seasoned well.  The oregano and cumin french fry seasoning is good.  The lemon and garlic fry juice is tasty and bring out ketchup well.  Conveniently located in a shopping center.  My second drop in and it's consistently good. Love the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Having driven out to Ballantyne to visit the proprietor's brothers Greco Fresh Grille, we are super excited that they were able to find a location to open here in Tega Cay!!!

Large menu of authentic Greek food, priced very reasonably and all made, as the name says, FRESH and delicious!

Gonna be a regular!
Liquor license applied for, so beer soon available I assume. #Winning"}
{"text":"Yuuuuge fans of this authentic self and delicious place!
Prices are very reasonable.
Very substantial Greek menu, for a small restaurant. 

So glad that they just opened up a location in Tega Cay!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  The falafel pita was flavorful and didn't miss eating meat it was so good."}
{"text":"Every thing was delicious. I have tried Salad,kabobs and Veg pita, the flavor is really great. It's located in big shopping complex, lot of happening area.
Weekend brunch is good to go and relax."}
{"text":"Food was okay but it made me appreciate Showmars.  The floors were greasy and they must have poor ventilation - there was a haze in the air and two days later I put my jacket on and it smells like the place."}
{"text":"Have this place on speed dial. Easy to order by fone, pickup & have a very reasonable, healthy meal. Altho, I do splurge on the lemon-oregano fries sometimes!
Their portions are great....not 2-3 strips of chicken in the wrap....much more and only $6!
Always fresh!"}
{"text":"I have celiac disease and the cooks cleaned the grill before making the lamb to go on my Greek salad. Bravo! I could see them so I had increased confidence. Not sure if the used a fresh spatula and gloves but  no problems so far. The food was good and fresh and their attentiveness was superb. I'll have to teach them more next time around."}
{"text":"Good clean restaurant. You order and pay upfront but they bring you food to the table. The kefte was spiced very nicely and the Greek salad was good. I could use just a little less salt, perhaps next time I shall tell them that when I order"}
{"text":"The best place for gyro.I am so addicted to the veggie gyro. I wish this place is next to the place I work. I would go at least three time a week. Everything is great at this place."}
{"text":"The falafel us pretty good. A little too much tzaki, but still good. The fries 6 to very well with it, though. The deserts are fantastic!"}
{"text":"We went back yesterday, and it looks like the owner's family may be running it now that the new store has opened and the food quality issues have been addressed.  They did an excellent job and were very friendly.  The food was cooked to order and very fresh.  

I went with the chicken souvlaki and it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The fries were fresh and perfect!  My husband still says it is the best gyro in Charlotte.  We are looking forward to going back more regularly."}
{"text":"This is a great place. It's not dance and very casual. The food is delicious. I recommend snacking on the hummus. Treat yourself to a big basket of fries."}
{"text":"Got the chicken platter with cumin garlic fries; added pita bread with chipotle garlic hummus.  Everything was excellent.  The staff was friendly and smiling despite a line out the door. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a VERY family feel. From the second you walk in to the second you leave this spot will be a great experience. They're quick, and efficient, and the food is not sloppy. Prices are reasonable. I tried the falafel there today and Good Gosh it was to die for. Try the lemon zest hummus, and the lemon oregano fries are amazing. YUM!!!! You cant beat the prices for fresh quick REAL Greek food. The manager Nick came up to check on us, he is a very humble guy. Glad to see a great business being successful. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"While driving all over Charlotte to buy things for my Halloween costume I stumbled upon this place and decided to give it a shot. 

Walking in, it almost reminds me of a little high school cafeteria (my HS at least lol).
We were greeted by a very nice young lady who promptlytook our order.
(You order your meal at a small little counter while overlooking the grill/cooking area.)

We had an order of hummus w/ pita, chicken gyro with lemon oregano fries, and a greek salad w/ grilled chicken. Everything was delicious. I must say that I'm not a \"seasoned\" fry type of guy....in fact I HATE when fries have anything on them other than salt...and these fries were very good. 

This was my first time here but I was very happy with the entire experience. If your looking for a quick delicious bite to eat, this is the PERFECT alternative for a fast food joint/quick lunch place."}
{"text":"Solid food for a Solid Price.  I have tried the Chicken Gyro and Falafel now.  Both are solid dishes with a very flavorful Tzatziki sauce. They offer fries with different seasoning.  Both the Cumin Garlic and Lemon Oregano have great taste. 

Seating inside is a little tight, but if the weather is good,  you can sit outside and overlook the Blakeney park.  

I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Super excited that they opened close to my house.  I work closer to their other location and we always stop by to pick up for dinner.  Now that they are closer we are here for Sunday lunch. Delicious, fresh and authentic food."}
{"text":"Went there today and enjoyed a gyro with a side of lemon hummus. The food was flavorful, fresh and filling. The staff was friendly, which is important as well. 

Whenever I wanted a gyro I had to go uptown to Little Village Grill, which is a 5 star. They prepare a great  gyro and the way they season their fries are simply delicious! 

This Greek franchise ( in Fort Mill) is a clear 4 star; we've needed a nice Greek place here. I wish them them much success & we'll will be going there often."}
{"text":"Great food, usually I go to the little village grill in CLT - awesome place but when I don't want to drive to CLT this is the best closer place to go to."}
{"text":"Visiting from Florida for the Carolina Ragnar and we were looking for a close place to eat! This was delicious!!! The owner was so friendly and the food was exactly what we needed after a long day in the car and a long weekend ahead of running! The food was very fresh!"}
{"text":"Food is good but they tend to mess up the order. So make sure, you double check your order or you will end up with a $17 bill for lunch."}
{"text":"A great family restaurant. The food was excellent and had great prices. The chicken gyro was delicious as well as the choices of hummus....."}
{"text":"Really good food and generous portions. Attentive service and good family spot for quick meal. 

Will def be back."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!! I can't seem to really want to order anything else outside of the shrimp pita when I go! Or the fries!!! 
My daughter loves it all. The service is great and the food is fresh, definitely my go to in Blakney!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for lunch today and both were extremely impressed by all aspects of our dining experience. Staff were all friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and offered very informative suggestions where needed.  I had the lamb burger with feta cheese and sea salt fries and my wife had the Greek Salad - both were OUTSTANDING!  The Tzatziki sauce was the best I've ever had.  And you know, when something as basic as Tzatziki sauce (basically a condiment) is noticeably better than all others, it speaks volume of the quality and taste of everything else on the menu.  Greco Fresh Grille is a definite must try!"}
{"text":"Stopped here wanting a REAL gyro. So the husband & I met in this tight congested shopping center & walked in this nicely decorated eatery. There is a crisp decor & not overly done. 
The staff is very friendly & helpful. There is a large menu hanging over the open kitchen area. A long counter in front of the cooking are does have s few stools to sit & eat or maybe wait for your take out order. 
The are several small tables & seems to have a nice patio out back that would be a great place for a group. 
At the end of the counter is where you order so after standing & looking up for several minutes we proceed to the register & order lamb gyros & make it a combo for $2.50 for, which gave us a drink & fries. We choose the lemon & oregano fried just for a change of pace! 

We were given our paper drink cups & a number & found a table placed the number card in the stand & waited for just a little bit. Soon a girl brings our meals that are served in plastic diner basket with wax paper lining it. Gave us real silverware wrapped in a napkin.

opened up my gyro and my eyes just were so very wide looking at the massive amount shoved in this pita bread. ive never been given to much meat in one of these before! it was 2 slices (not super thin either!) nicely cooked with just a hint of pink in the center. Tzatziki  sauce fresh and placed on the bottom then a lot of sliced purple onion, some tomato slices and topped with that meat.
the fries were really good, I didnt detect the lemon but hubs said he could sometimes. but the oregano was really nice. served with a small solo cup of ketchup. I think next time I might get some Tzatziki  sauce to dip them in!~

The drinks are a fill it yourself, so if eating in this is nice since you can fill er up before you leave. They had 2 tea urns, but i didnt see which was sweet and which was unsweet so I just went with soda.

my only negatives are that it was a little loud, people trying to talk over the loud greek radio type music/talking over head. also I found it really weird that neither my hubs or myself could get a cell signal in here! (AT&T). strange! we had to check in on yelp once we were done and walked outside."}
{"text":"The service is fantastic! The food cooked freshly as you order and are prepared quickly. I tried the lamb gyro and my friend tried the veggie gyro, both are amazing! This is one of the best mediterranean restaurant I've been to! If anyone has tried their stuffed grape leaves or the orange phyllo dessert let us know how it is!"}
{"text":"I first visited Greco's a few days after they opened and I was blown away by the crowds that were already gathering. It didn't take me long to understand the reason for the immediate love that folks were showing - it's because of the great people, the FANTASTIC quality and the unique and interesting menu that you will find at Greco's. 

I've since met owner Nick and his enthusiasm and desire to please his customers is so rare in this area and in these times. He and his family truly work hard to earn the business. I've eaten here at least a dozen times since they opened and the quality has been exceptional every time. 

The shrimp skewer platter is awesome and I could eat a gyro every day for the next month. Nick grills the meat to order every time so it's always fresh and hot. The salads are also very crisp and fresh. 

I plan on working my way through the whole menu and I look forward to visiting Greco's regularly. 

It is so great to have Greco's in Fort Mill and  I recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Everything here is delicious - very flavorful and fresh. The tzatziki sauce here is my favorite so far, and I normally order it on the side with my food even if my dish doesn't come with it. You'll also find friendly employees who keep a clean restaurant which is key in a place like this since it stays pretty busy! The lemon oregano fries are amazing and go great with the gyros. This place is  definitely my favorite Greek restaurant in the area and I'm happy they're expanding towards the South Park area!"}
{"text":"My husband had the veggie pita and added shrimp. It was very filling and fresh.  I had the traditional pita with a side salad. Everything was custom made to order and the service was the best I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Recently visited for the first time.  Food was wonderful and the Tzatziki sauce spot on!"}
{"text":"I am new to the neighborhood and was so excited that there was a local owned Mediterranean restaurant near me. I was not disappointed! The falafel was moist and flavorful. The gyro had lots of lamb and great flavor. The Greek salad was enough to share. The baklava was to die for. Seriously my new favorite Greek place.I will be back with froends."}
{"text":"First, let me start by saying the service was great! The owner stepped out from behind the counter to go over the menu with us and made sure we were satisfied until we walked out the door.

The chicken gyro and kefte platter was really tasty. However, the rice could use more seasoning. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good fries and the pitas are all good. Tastes fresh and prices are very competitive. Good for lunch or dinner and families are accommodated. Staff are friendly. All around great place to eat."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing. The falafel, spinach pie triangle, and their famous lemon- oregano fries were delicious. This is definitely my new Greek restaurant to go to."}
{"text":"So glad they opened in Fort Mill.   The food is great and the staff is very friendly. The salad with grilled chicken is huge and delicious. Love their gyros too. One of my favorite lunch places."}
{"text":"This has to be my new favorite go to spot for Greek food. The employees upfront were amazing. Greeted us right when we walked in and were more than willing to answer any questions we had about the menu. The food was absolutely delicious! Very warm and fresh. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to see mostly good reviews. But they don't answer phones and apparently they could care less about being open during their posted hours of operation. Even tried going in person to show up to locked doors hours before closing. If you can't actually be open during your own posted hours you should not own a business. Very very verrrrry poorly ran establishment."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food. Glad to have a local place. Humus is tasty and salads were good. Will defiantly come back as we are fans. Not the best Mediterranean food, but still worth the time and effort and portions were adequate but seemed a bit small for the price."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Very skimpy with meat portions. Daughter got shrimp platter, I got chicken platter and hubby got lamb platter. Greek salad was disappointing. Feta cheese was terrible. Consistency of tofu with feta flavoring.  Green peppers in Greek salad?  Never!!!!  But they did. Lamb was gristly and chicken was dry. Shrimp was good but overall meat portions very small for the hefty price. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food. I went there and had the classic gyro all the way and a order of Baklava.
Had a nice time speaking with the manager and shared some stories. Really excellent place, highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"WOW WOW WOW!!!  This little hole in the wall is amazing!!  My best friends when I was a child were Orthodox Greek straight from the islands and one of my best friends now is Greek and she and her Mother make AWESOME Greek food.   With all of that being said, I'm a major Greek food snob and I have unreasonably high standards, as a result.  I have been to dozens of Greek restaurants over the years and a handful from Charlotte, NC to Columbia, SC and, hands-down...Greco is far superior to any other that I have been to.  The freshness of the ingredients, the flavors and seasonings, and the quality of the meat is just like my Greek friends have made me accustomed to.

I visited Greco for a late lunch.  Even at 2:00 on a weekday, there were several people in their enjoying their meals and more coming in as I was waiting.  The decor is unpretentious and captures the essence of Greece beautifully.  It has a bit of a Greek Diner feel, which I LOVE!  The service was fast and friendly and I enjoyed watching the chef  (owner, maybe??) prepare my food...\"FRESH' is the key word in the title here.  I watched intently and everything was homemade (Tzatziki, Greek dressing, Lamb patties, etc).

I ordered the Lamb Gyro combo with Lemon and Oregano Fries and a Peasant Salad.  The lamb patties for the Gyro are made onsite with fresh lamb and the most perfect Greek Lamb seasoning blend.  It's cooked on the grill-top to order (not made from greasy pre-fab mounds kept warm on a a spit).  This is real deal!!  The meat was moist, tender, and delicious!  It was served with housemade Tzatziki and tomato on a warm pita (I asked them to hold the onions).  The Tzatziki is made with yogurt, fresh shredded cucumbers, fresh herbs, and TONS of garlic....it's a flavor sensation!   The fries...OMG, the fries!!!  The most incredible seasoned fries I have ever tasted.  Tastes like traditional Greek Potatoes, but in french fry form (brilliant marketing move, BTW...everyone loves french fries!!).  French fries are fresh cut with skins, fried crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle and then they are tossed in a bowl with salt, lemon juice, and oregano.  I will have dreams about these fries!  LOL   Last, but not least, is the Peasant Salad.  The Peasant Salad is everything that you love about a traditional Greek salad, minus the lettuce.  Giant wedges of plump red tomatoes, thinly sliced red onion, sliced seedless cucumbers (with the skin on), Kalamata Olives, and big cubes of deliciously salty and tangy feta cheese.  Again, all of the ingredients are put into a bowl and hand-tossed with Greek dressing and an extra dash of seasoning.  Salad is served with warm pita wedges.   It was a fantastic salad and the serving was huge!  Salads can also be topped with their house-marinated Chicken or Shrimp or their yummy Lamb.  They also have a Vegetarian Pita made with Red Peppers, Eggplant, and Zucchini and a kids menu.  They also offer Whole Wheat Pitas for a mere .25 charge.

Prices are excellent as well.  I paid $15.00 (Gyro combo with Fries and a Drink and a full-sized Peasant Salad) and I made two meals out of it!  BTW, the Fries reheat perfectly in the oven!  

If you are looking for heavy Greek dishes such as Pasticio, Baked Fish, or Leg of Lamb, this isn't the place.  If you are looking for delicious Greek quick dishes, this is a must-try!

I can't wait to go back with my husband....he is going to love it!!!   I must try the Spanikopita next time!

I have a new favorite lunch place!!

Update Oct 8, 2012: I have been back 3-4 times since my original review and the 5-star rating still stands!  The service is always excellent and the ingredients are always very fresh.  My Husband, Son, and Mother have also eaten here with me and they love it, too.  I truly can't say enough about the house-made Gyro meat...it is moist and perfectly seasoned every time!   We have also tried the Spanikopita and it is very good, too!  This is \"the\" place for Gyros!"}
{"text":"The owner is great and super friendly. Most of the food is excellent, and the baklava is great. My only complaints are the lack of healthy options (a lot of fried food) and the Falafel is usually really dry."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing food!! You won't be disappointed!! I had the shrimp kebabs and my husband had the beef gyro! Let's just say we are both satisfied, and we will definitely be back for more!! Super happy they will have mousaka on the menu next week!! I love me some authentic Greek food!!"}
{"text":"Greco Fresh Grille is great. We always walked by and considered trying it out but never did until a friend told me they serve the best gyros she's ever had. Great recommendation! We love this place now. I always order a gyro, either chicken or falafel. The chicken is delicious, very simply prepared with tzatziki, tomato, lettuce and red onions, but still flavorful. The falafel is good, too. Sometimes a bit under-seasoned, but still good. My husband prefers the burger. It's seasoned well and you can add American, mozzarella or feta cheese. They have seasoned french fries, too. We like them all: lemon-oregano, cumin and garlic and, plain with sea salt. Their hummus is delicious too. The flavors change weekly, my favorite is probably the rosemary hummus. The restaurant itself is small but comfortable. It's in a great location within Blakeney. The staff is awesome. They're so nice and you can tell they take pride in what they do. Gréco Fresh Grille is a great, quick Mediterranean restaurant."}
{"text":"Didn't even have garlic sauce, ordered the platter, meat was good but in short supply, rice was good, meal came with pita bread but no hummus, it has to ordered on the side for like 4 bucks, weak, you can do better"}
{"text":"I don't get down to Blakeney often - in fact, it seems like one of the last times I was here was for this very location, though I'm pretty certain it was a different business then. Regardless, it looks like Greco Fresh is doing a solid business. In fact, their menu is so enticing it can be a challenge to decide what to order. Staff is friendly and eager to help you decide (though they really just help you get stuff on the table, so you end up with plenty of food, not eliminate choices).

This is perhaps not a stop for a fancy date, and is more similar to a corner deli than a sit-down meal that you will enjoy for some time prior to a big night on the town - not that there is anything wrong with that, of course. Plenty of food, from the appetizer options to the meal and also a good selection of deserts too. Good choices all around. Well worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been the other locations but I'm glad this one opened up because it's close to my work. We got several items here to go and we were all pleased! I was surprised at how the presentations looked in the to go boxes. It was all a nice touch. 

I got the shrimp kabobs with rice. I couldn't believe how much rice they gave me. Shrimp was delicious and tender. Several people for the chicken gyro and loved it. Two people got salads with salmon on it and thought the salmon was cooked well. 

Can't wait to come back! Prices are also very reasonable!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Blakeney area. We got a good parking space and came on a saturday for lunch. They weren't busy at all. Restaurant isn't large but a little narrow. Cashier answered all our questions and was very sweet.

I got the shrimp pita sandwich and spicy fries. Shrimp was delicious and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would ask for is extra red onions. Tatziki sauce went well with it. Spicy fries were good but had a lot of seasoning on it. Some people might like that, but I rather have them lightly seasoned. They also had other flavors of fries. My husband got the chicken pita sandwich and a greek salad. Salad was very fresh. Chicken was good. Very filling. Came with a lot of meat. Both of our meals came with drinks and after our 20% off coupon, it was only $18. 

I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great eats here. My wife had the gyro with a side of garlic fries and I had the seasoned chicken kebabs with the lemon-oregano fries. Our tastebuds exploded. Period. The lamb in the gyro is so delectably tender and well seasoned that nothing even comes close...anywhere. We're from NYC and have had a good gyro here and there but this really kicks butt. Not to be outshined were the kebabs. Seasoned to perfection and moist! The portions and price are just right. We've been here before but we continue to come back because of the consistency of service and food. 
The owner, by the way, is a rare guy indeed. In a world where the dollar is what motivates us all, this man has has a passion for his food and it shows.

Give this place a try and you won't be sorry. There are some businesses I'd like to see stick around and be successful and this is one of them."}
{"text":"The lamb gyro was good. French fries were under seasoned but cooked very well. My daughter loved her burger!  I do wish they had a house made, mid eastern style (very) hot sauce. Very nice service. I will probably be eating here at least once a week.  Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"This is a nice clean place. Food is good but not great. It satisfies my gyro craving but makes me miss the Greek from Astoria , Queens."}
{"text":"Saw the Now Open banner yesterday and visited today for lunch.  It is right next to a wonderful deli.  Met the owner, Nick, yesterday and seems like a stand up guy.  Today ordered two traditional Gyros and a side of hummus.  Absolutely delicious!  So nice to have another ehtnic food option in Tega Cay!  You need to try this place.  We will be back many times!"}
{"text":"I am a major fan of Greco Fresh Grille, I absolutely love the outdoor seating, amazing service, and french fries! This place has amazing vegetarian options and a great comfortable setting. I have been here many times and I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Favorite place for lunch, wonderful family owned restaurant, great gyro's and the garlic cumin fries are to die for. Hummus is made fresh daily, this is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, fresh and fast! Family friendly. Salmon pita and cumin garlic fries (extra crispy) are my favorites"}
{"text":"This is a brand new establishment be as expected the crowd flood it at least for lunch. It was crowded. They have a number system that you place on your table and a server comes and delivers your food but you pay prior to like you would at a fast food place. The food is mediocre at best for Greek. The fries were over salted and the meat is not bursting with flavor. The value is not there for $11 my platter was not delicious me I would not count on coming back. Staff is friendly but seems overwhelmed."}
{"text":"The best french fries in Charlotte.  Period.  These are delicious fresh cut seasoned fries that are french fry perfection.  I have had the lemon & oregano and the cumin & garlic and both are excellent.  I enjoy the shrimp pita and the veggie pita.  Both have creamy delicious sauce and fresh purple onion slices wrapped in a warm soft pita bread wrap.  Employees are friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I am ECSTATIC that Greco has come to Tega Cay!!!! I always have the chicken gyro and lemon oregano fries, and they are fantastic. Love the staff, too! Very genuine, nice people."}
{"text":"Love their baklava. The queen makes it. The owner and his daughter are very nice people too--they run the joint."}
{"text":"Wow. I wish I had eaten here sooner. The customer service is wonderful.  Nick offered me a military discount & told me to thank my father for his service. He also gave me wonderful menu suggestions. 

I ordered the chicken gyro & a side of grape leaves. I dined outside.
Note: this is a perfect lunch spot if you have children. You can watch them play while you eat. 

The food & customer service was awesome. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Go elsewhere for Greek food in south Charlotte. Both the kefte and chicken were extremely dry and the hummus lacked any flavor. Very disappointed in the quality of the food and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love this little Greek spot.  Most days you'll find the owner, Nick, running the register.  Nick is super friendly and always generates a conversation with his customers.  Actually the entire customer experience is great as everyone here is really nice. 

The food is consistently great.  I have tried several items, but my go to is the Mezze Platter which includes spinach pies, dolmades, tzatziki, feta, olives, hummus, cucumbers and pita.  Only $8.95 for all this!!

For the gluten allergy people, any sandwich on the menu can be made into a lettuce wrap.  Also pita pizza, burger or chicken fingers for the little ones that may not like the regular menu. 

This place easily gets and deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and delicious.  Varied menu.  Family owned. Have been in about a half dozen times and food is always consistently excellent, as well as the customer service.  Good value.  New and always very clean."}
{"text":"It's really great to have a place like this nearby. It's right up the road and easy to find and the food is great.
My wife and I moved here from San Francisco a number of years ago and have been waiting for great food places to open. 
It looks like our wishes are finally coming true."}
{"text":"Fast food atmosphere - but quite possible one of the BEST Greek Gyros in all of South Charlotte. The owner is authentic Greek descandant and they were playing Greek radio (Pandora) while we ate. 

Very authentic, and large, generous portions of sliced meat."}
{"text":"I live close to this fantastic Mediterranean gem.  I get takeout and eat in at least twice a week when I am not traveling.  I have never had a bad meal in the last 3 years.  In fact, when I am out of town I crave their Greek salad and tzatziki sauce.  I have a good friend who recently moved his office and can't get there for lunch any longer, and it is one one thing he said he misses the most.  My girl friend loves their veggie pita and fries.    The staff is very friendly and always smiling, especially Mia, Blake, and Michelle.  Although the place is small it is always very clean.   Craving it!  Heading over for dinner right now!!"}
{"text":"Would go out of our way to go to the Blakeney location before they built one closer to us. Family owned with very friendly staff! The lemon oregano fries are out of this world. Also, love that they offer a wheat pita option."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's clean, the food is good and has  reasonable price. Their platter and buklava is my fav."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is awesome! Owners and workers are super friendly. The food was awesome! Definitely going for the traditional gyro next time! Get the lemon fries"}
{"text":"I try and give this place another try but every time
It disappoints. I just ordered a to go meal and I get home and the fries were literally raw- like the potato.. and my chicken was raw as well. Threw it all away. Will not be returning and will tell others to not go here as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard really good things about Greco's other restaurants so I decided to pick up dinner last Saturday. It was great! I got the traditional gyro and the Mrs. got the Greek salad with chicken. The meats were well seasoned, the tzatziki was home made and tasted great! Their stuffed grape leaves and hummus were really good, too. Thrilled to have another great restaurant to add to our Saturday night options! You can probably tell from the other reviewers pictures that it's more of a \"counter service\" place. Inside is nice, no frills. A little small. It's in a strip mall. Has outside seating. I decided not to take off any stars for the layout. It's not their fault. Food is great, that's all that matters!"}
{"text":"Well, I decided to give this another shot. I came in for lunch and went with a gyro and oregano fries. I was much more impressed this time. I felt the quality of the food was much more in line with what I was paying, and if I recall correctly, the inside of the restaurant has been improved. The oregano fries are a nice change, but I do think they go a tad heavy on the oregano. I thought the service was much better this go around. After my visit, I feel like I'll come back to this place more frequently."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Love the chick pea salad with salmon! Arugula is fresh and the tastiest lemon dressing. Oh! the fries with rosemary and lemon are to die for. We are there at least once a week if not more! My favorite restaurant at Blakeney."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Gyro you can get around! Coming from New Jersey, I've tried many Greek places in the NY/NJ area. Never have I tried a place as authentic and as delicious as Greco Fresh Grille! Employees are friendly, place looks great, and food is the best! I had the lamb gyro, Greek fries, lemon rosemary hummus, and peasant salad. All fantastic choices! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the Blaneney shopping center, close to 5 Guys.  Parking is very tight in this corner of the shopping center -okay, parking is tight in the ENTIRE shopping center- so you will likely be parking a little ways from the restaurant.  The resturant is layed out a little oddly, so you are literally standing on top of the menu while you look at it. There is a nice back patio you can sit on that is close to the Blakeney Fountain.  

The food came out quick and was delicious. Their Chicken Gyro was delicious.  They offer many different seasoning options for your fries, which I will definitely try the next time I am in. I really wish the girl taking my order had asked which I wanted, because I didn't even see the options until after I had ordered."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at Greco Fresh Grille, though I had been wanting to go for over a year! The food is as fresh as can be. I ordered the falafel pita wrap and spicy fries. The falafel was amazing - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. There is a generous amount of falafel in the wrap. The dressing (tzatziki, I think) inside the pita was delicious. I will definitely be back. Spicy fries were the best I've had in a while. I am so glad they opened a restaurant close to South Park!"}
{"text":"Just had our first experience at Greco and the food was to die for! The chicken kabobs, fries, and baklava were delicious. Not to mention the very attentive and kind staff. We will definitely be returning for excellent Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Awesome food. Casual place. Fresh food. Great staff. Try Greco fresh today!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!

My wife and I waited almost 6 months before we decided to try this greek place.  I don't know why we waited so long but it still pains me to think of all those months I missed of spectacular greek food less than two miles away in Blakeney.  

Growing up in the Greek Orthodox church, being a foodie, and spending our honeymoon in Greece, I am very picky about my greek food from the quality of the meats, to the tzatziki sauce and pitas, to the salads, and the dressings.

My ultimate favorite dish they serve is the lamb gyro.  The meat is by FAR the best in town.  Hot, flavorful, and with just the right amount of tzatziki and olive oil...mmm, my mouth is watering now.  DO NOT overlook having fries with your gyro!  So many greek places have those fat, undercooked, unflavorful fries that I CAN'T stand!  Not here.  The Greco Fresh fries are hand cut, served hot, and if you want, drizzled with lemon juice and topped with oregano, that's right, superb! (I like mine with tzatziki sauce for dipping).   

My wife loves the peasant salad which I always have to help her finish.  If you're not familiar with a peasant salad, it's just the good stuff, no lettuce filler.  Think fresh cucumbers, green peppers, onions (if you want), tomatoes, olives, lots of feta, and of course, their delicious house made dressing.  You can't go wrong with this salad.  This is the way salad should be, why waste space with lettuce that has no taste.  

One word of caution, the homemade tzatziki sauce stays on the breath for a while if you eat as much as I do so come packing a few pieces of gum for after your meal, especially if going back to work.

They also have Cheerwine on tap which is the shizzle if you are a true born and raised North Carolinian.  

The customer service there is top notch, probably the best in Ballantyne, and the owner always walks around if he has time and talks and jokes with his customers.

The one comment about the \"greek\" guy who was angry about the baklava being store bought obviously needs to have his greek cred checked.  Maybe it didn't taste like your mommas but it is definitely not from any store. Not only are the desserts baked in house, the owner's wife makes them which is why they sometimes don't have galaktoboureko, doesn't get more small business greek than that.

With that being said, go eat at Greco Fresh and enjoy!  Maybe you'll see us there tonight as well..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly and delicious. The place is great. The gyros are fresh and this place is becoming my new go to place for Greek food."}
{"text":"Gyro pita was good but too small, could have eaten two whereas at Showmars one fills me up.  Gyro meat not shaved....but preformed patties.  Fries were overdone and tasted burnt...but they weren't....which is odd.  Dining room kinda small and cramped......slightly pricey for what you get.  One trash can by the register....hard to clear your own table.  Casual atmosphere makes you think \"Five Guys of Greek food\"."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant after church every Sunday!  We are addicted to their home made baklava ... The best I've ever had!!  And the shrimp pita is my favorite, take it outside and enjoy the gorgeous weather!  The staff is super friendly also!"}
{"text":"This was the best Greek place I have been to in Charlotte. I loved that it was clean and quiet and how fast the food came. I had the Mezze platter to try something different and I was impressed with how good & fresh everything looked and tasted. the spinach pies were off the hook. This is a must if you swing by the Colony Rd area. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and pleasant staff! Highly recommend the chicken gyro and fries. Consistent too, prolly been 10 times over the years."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Super fresh - authentic food.  Imagine that!!  Owner is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a lunch and the place was pretty packed for lunch time. We ordered gyro platter and special platter. Special platter comes with choice of meat, salad and rice or fries. The platter of lamb was pretty good. It is a good deal of the meal. Tzatziki sauce and the fries were good and the food is fresh there! Enjoyed the meal. FYI, the place is self service and tables are limited. But  there are outdoor seatings so you can enjoy when the weather is good."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch spot. Delicious food & friendly employees. Falafel was so good!! Love how bright and cheerful the décor is. Will definitely be frequenting this spot!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The chicken gyro is amazing and extremely well priced. The Greek family that owns the place are so nice and welcoming. You feel like you are eating at their place."}
{"text":"By far one of the best places to eat st. Great food, great owners and great prices....win, win all around. Best Greek I've had in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Lamb gyro and the \"lemon and oregano\" fries. Fresh hot and tasty.  Was a little louder than what we like, but no issues even with several children in the restaurant. I would like to see them rearrange the drink and condiments area as it is a bit cluttered and so close to the table across from it you almost bump into them if they are seated there. I think they have wi-fi if you need it. Great Greek food without waiting for the Greek festival. We will return on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great food, don't waste anymore time looking for good Greek food. It is right here!!!
Great service and customer care."}
{"text":"Really good food, really good service!! We have always ordered the gyros.  We have liked them all.  The kids meals are great too."}
{"text":"3 words....Lemon.Rosemary.Hummus.  

GAME CHANGER!  Best hummus I have had in Charlotte.  I don't know how or why but this hummus is on point!!!  They could be adding gasoline for all I know and I wouldn't even care.  The consistency is perfect, the flavor mixture is spot on, the pita bread served with it is warm and fresh.  Yummm...what a treat.  They offer other flavors of hummus as well including Chipolte and traditional.  I'm sure they are great.  

The greek salad was very good and the dessert we ordered was phenomenal!!  I don't know the real greek word and I am too lazy to look it up but it was some type of custard in a phyllo dough, baked, warm and ridiculously good.  It was big enough to share but I could have housed the whole thing on my own with no problem.  

The place is not much to look at and the Blakeney location is sandwiched inbetween Brixx and Cold Stone so it gets a bit lost and a bit crazy on the weekends.  They can't really seat more than a table of 4 inside but they have a small outdoor patio.  Word on the street is they have another location...I think they said Stallings?  Somewhere out there.  Anyway, love them.  Far from where I live but worth the trip.  I need to try a few more things but this may be my go-to for Greek moving forward."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro was awesome! The chicken is seasoned to perfection, with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes, tzatziki on a warm gyro! I chose a side salad which was just as great, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, feta, onions & an amazing homemade dressing! Love it!!!"}
{"text":"My wife heard about this place opening recently and being lovers of all things Gyro we gave it a shot over the Holidays. It was awesome! Friendly staff and great fresh made hummus, salads, etc....All for a fair price. The lemon dill hummus and Parmesan oregano fries were excellent. So much so, we ended up going back three days later to try a few more selections. Better still our boys loved it, too, so now we have a new family dinning venue right around the corner."}
{"text":"Deliciously prepared! Service was prompt and courteous. I would highly recommend this for fresh Greek food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a fresh gyro and it was excellent. I had a seat at the bar where I could see into the kitchen and watch the magic happen. Very clean, very efficient organized process going on here.

My gyro didn't take long to be cooked and assembled. Nice thick pieces of lamb and the tzatziki was excellent. Only slightly messy, which it's kind of supposed to be. Delicious!

Cute little restaurant. Not quite first date material but certainly great for a meet up."}
{"text":"Good solid fresh food and hearty portions .Reasonable prices and nice variety. They owned a diner in North Jersey. Family owned . They know what they are doing ."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyro I've had in Charlotte, and one of the best I've had anywhere. The food is consistently good, obviously fresh, and the owners are very friendly. The prices are great, too. My wife and I make at least a couple trips a month."}
{"text":"You have to try their food! Absolutely delicious! Ive had their salmon, shrimp, chicken, lamb, and even vegetarian dishes. All perfectly seasoned!!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with a confession: I don't like gyros. Feta cheese? Pass. You know what changed my mind? This place. I now eat here or get takeout once a week because everything is fresh, delicious, well-prepared. I love GFG. The cumin-garlic fries are like, whoa fries calm down! Try them. try everything. TRY IT!!!"}
{"text":"It's nice to find a place that will make your order the way you want. Everything I get has to be changed in someway (just a picky eater) but the staff here does so and always with a smile. The owner always engages me when he takes my order and really makes you feel good about your day. If that wasn't enough, the food is terrific. Good home style Greek favorites. Cooked just right with the perfect amount of seasoning. I highly recommend them for Lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! We had the traditional gyro's and lemon oregano fries. For dessert we had their baklava. All of it...the bomb dot com. Coming from a Greek food lover. :)"}
{"text":"CHECK THE MENU PRICES AND YOUR ORDER TOTAL BEFORE YOU PAY!!!

Ok, I just had to get that out before I start my review. I went to Greco a little after the lunch time rush after seeing the awesome reviews on Yelp. When I walked in only a couple of tables were seated. I reviewed the huge menu posted and proceeded to the register to place my ToGo order. I knew that I wanted the Platter, but I wasn't quite sure which meat I wanted. I had a taste for some beef so I asked if they offered Steak or Beef, he said no. I then asked what Kefte and falafel were (I don't have much Greek cuisine experience), he said Kefte was a beef patty *blank stare* sir can I have the Kefte platter please!! I ordered it with Lemon Oregano fries and the Greek Salad that the menu says it comes with. Kind of irritated I handed him my card not even paying attention to the cost. I sat down to sign the receipt and noticed it had a total of $16.28!! Now WAYMENT!!! I know that menu says $9.95 for Kefte! I checked the board and the printed menu before bringing it to his attention. He then tries to tell me that the platter doesn't come with Kefte and that he instead charged me for Grilled Kefte and added a salad since it doesn't come with one. But err-uhhh the menu clearly lists Kefte as an option for the platter. We walked over to the board TWICE as he continued to argue with me about it. He then eventually says, ok the platter costs more with Kefte and it'll be $10.95 before tax. At this point I just looked at him totally confused. He then comes back and says ok i'll charge you $10.95 and give you $1 in cash and you pay the $9.95. I ended up paying $10.96 with that credit in cash. 

When I got back to the office I was completely underwhelmed. The Salad, was just SAD! Just looking at it didn't have me at all excited to eat it. That's all I have for that, ended up rotting in my fridge. The Kefte was just ok. The beef with dry and tough. The fries were soft and lacked flavor. Probably needed salt. I tasted a hint of Lemon here and there but other than that, nothing. The best part of the meal with the Pita Wedges. I ate all of those. I'm not sure if it was because I ordered Togo, or maybe they gave me lackluster food because I demanded I be charged the correct price, but my food was not as good as the reviews rave about.

I now see a few people note that their meal price seemed to come out higher than the menu. And i'm telling you that this is not just a coincidence! I'll definitely not be returning again, but if you go, check prices before you pay because they are as crooked as they come!!"}
{"text":"Amazing everything.  I have never been disappointed or left feeling hungry.  Great food, nice staff, always a pleasure. 

Also....REALLY Good food."}
{"text":"Really solid spot for casual Greek in Blakeney.  I've tried both the chicken and lamb gyros, and both are quite yummy.  I appreciate having the option for whole wheat pita, even with the 25 cent upcharge.  Have tried both types of fries, lemon oregano and garlic cumin, and while they're sure to make any fry lover happy, I didn't find them particularly spectacular.  I prefer to opt for their hummus, with an interesting rotation of flavors, having tried the chipotle hummus which was good.  Prices are very reasonable, with pitas going for $6, with an extra $3 to make it a combo with fries or hummus and a drink.  Highly recommend for a quick lunch if you find yourself in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent!! So delicious!!! I had the Greek salad, super FRESH! The dressing is wonderful!! My daughter had a chicken gyro and my husband had the beef gyro.  Both excellent!! So so happy to have excellent Greek food in Tega Cay/Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Awesome gyros and great atmosphere.  My favorite is the fries.  They are great fries without the added spices.  The added spices make them unique."}
{"text":"I visited Greco for the first time today. I am a fan of Greek food and this place exceeded my expectations. The menu items were very fresh and the food was full of flavor. Their are a variety of options for the fries and combinations for the meal. I would also like add that the service was great. As a first timer I was provided with recommendations which turned out to be great suggestions. If you are ever in the area and looking for a place to eat I would strongly recommend Greco."}
