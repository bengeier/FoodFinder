{"text":"Good place to get fresh and quick Indian food. Very few places serve this authentic Indian in reasonable price and fast service. However, I would like to suggest them a couple of things  1. Chola Poori combo - Poori is  too less for the quantity of mix veg and chana masala  Will be good, if they serve bigger poori or 3 pooris  2.Butter chicken and spicy chicken combo is okay. Should give more quantity of sauce on the rice.  3. I tried their new introductory dish Chicken Biryani which is flavoured meat rice. I would suggest them to increase the quantity of the rice they give. $9.03 should get you sufficient amount of rice to fill you up .  Tandoori chicken looks yummy, I am going to try it next time.  Overall, this is a good place to have a quick delicious treat. I would go back here."}
{"text":"Really quiet @ 3pm.  I have to say, this place is so new (as the name and signs of the previous place still there) and with me getting there at 3pm for lunch, it's really not fair to give them a 1 or 2 star review.  First of all, they should get rid of the name/signs or anything that shows it's the previous shawarma place, because I was at their door and it stopped me from going in. I thought I was at the wrong place.  Second, they should have a chime or bell or something to let them know someone had came into the place. I walked in and until I peek into the kitchen/prep area, the guy didn't know someone is here.  Third, they seems to serve chicken and veg only. Don't seems to have any other meat. I guess it's alright, people like chicken... Oh they have FISH! But it seems so out of place.  The services was... weird, I ordered the meal combo ($9.99) and from picture you can see, it should have a mix of salad, a piece of papadum, rice with green pea, some potato or veg, some meat with sauce, and a sweet. But I was ask to choose the chicken, a spicy one or butter chicken as main. Rice didn't have anything green in it. No salad was given or explain that they ran out of it. No papadum. And the sweet, which they have it right there beside the stove, the server had to ask me \"do you want sweets?\" twice and have reply yes and yes, then he put it into the box on top of the rice.  If the item were shown on menu, it should be included, if you don't have it you can explain or find something to substitue. And the samosa was added without asking if I wanted it or not, which is weird, it has a hole inthe middle, as if they try to check and see if the filling is done or not, but I thought samosa was made with cooked fillings?  May be I really caught him off guard. May be they can be really good during normal lunch hours.  So this review has all the benefit of doubt goes toward the place. I will be back for another lunch, hopefully inthe regular lunch hours."}
