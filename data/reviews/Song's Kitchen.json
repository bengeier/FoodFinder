{"text":"Staff is amazing, food is average no complaints. Got the chilli chicken & the Manchurian beef. Best hot and sour soup I've had"}
{"text":"I come here twice a week. The portions are good, you get a quite filling lunch. Order the main dishes, because they come with free steamed rice. Also try the Kari Ayam."}
{"text":"Ordered via Just Eat. Even though it's cheap, it's not worth your money. Most Chinese food places load up on the main item, this place gives you a TINY SLIVER of what you'd normally get. The food is BLAND - my ma po tofu did not have any sauce whatsoever. I asked for spicy, they load it with black pepper. Disgusting. The fried rice is the same - bland and no wok fried flavor whatsoever. Their hot and sour soup tastes like cough medicine. Their Manchurian chicken is decent, but you won't be full cause you'll get only 4-5 tiny pieces worth. Sorry Song, we're not ordering again."}
{"text":"So I ordered takeout through just eat. The food came within two minutes of it's expected time. The food was hot and fresh. The Tom yum soup was pretty flavourless but it had lots of stuff in it. The pad Thai tasted like the pad Thai you would get from an all you can each sushi place. If wasn't very good at all. But the chilli chicken, fried rice, and spring rolls were highly loved. The price is right as long as you are aware of how many dishes you're ordering. Before we knew it we paid $85 for dinner. If you keep to the Hakka food then you'll love it"}
{"text":"I am starting to like this place more and more now.   Taste-wise, their food is actually quite average (a bit below, if anything). But it has a home-cooked feel to it that makes you come back for more.   Service is extremely slow, expect to wait around 10 minutes for each dish you order. But the lady that works there is extremely nice, and puts a lot of effort into the food.  Would come again!"}
{"text":"I definitely don't want to sound hateful but I really am disappointed with the quality of the food here. I honestly can say that this will be the last time I order from them.  I ordered: black pepper beef - which tasted okay, nothing amazing, almost bland sadly...  ma po tofu - which was so not worth it at all... it didnt taste good... and I love this dish a lot so this was a let down!  manchurian chicken (dry) - which was SOOOOO salty beyond belief that it gave us such a hard time finishing it... I mean, who likes over salted dishes?!  Shanghai noodles - a bit bland honestly... noodles was too overcooked.   and lastly, some fried chicken rice and garlic green bean which were the ONLY DECENT tasting dishes that my family actually liked. But still, nothing to rave about either.  I dont know what their specialties are, but I hope they revamp the menu because this isnt working out. The reviews arent as promising from what I see so I really hope they revive themselves in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been back twice this month. Beef teriyaki was excellent, the shrimp, chicken fried rice, lots of egg, very tasty. Looking forward to returning again, only downside, very expensive dishes, example, 15.50 plus tax for fried rice."}
{"text":"Tried this yesterday and my wife and I found it so-so.  Service was fast and the food was ready when I picked it up. I agree with one of the reviewers that the wife was friendly. Service 4 stars.   However, it is mainly about the food and compared to other Chinese restaurants in Mississauga, this place can improve a little. Portions could be a little bigger. Hot and Sour soup should be less watered down.  Still on the fence if I will come back again. However, given my track record on 2 star reviews, I probably wont."}
{"text":"Went  for lunch today. Lunch combo with a pop is under 6 dollars. Service was friendly and portions are very generous.  Ordered chilli chicken and it was very bland. Willing to give one more chance. Hopefully next time food will be more tastier."}
{"text":"Good food, quickly prepared, no MSG, and all very cheap for college students nearby. This is not the place you take your date to, but it's great for pick up and take out. And the lady that runs the place is the most friendly, I think. :-)"}
{"text":"Passed by it and saw a new place, so decided to check it out especially after reading Yelp review(s) on it. You get free steamed rice with combo options but decided to upgrade all three combos ordered with their egg fried rice and vegetarian noodles. I give three stars mainly for the service we received by the owners who are also the cooks and also serve you. The wife is especially friendly and you can tell the effort she puts in to keep you happy.   They have a variety of different cuisines - Chinese, Thai and Hakka Indian style but it is a strict --- meh. They have tried to recreate the dishes but I think they have a long way to go to get loyal clientele. For the food and value of the meal, I think 2 stars would be fair.    There are only two tables in the place that can seat approximately 8 people altogether.  They only have plastic cutlery and plate, so if you want to dine in, expect to be eating out of take out containers."}
