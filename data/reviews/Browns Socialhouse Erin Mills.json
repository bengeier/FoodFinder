{"text":"We stopped by Brown's this evening after driving by more than a dozen times because we live in the area.  Decided to check it out.  We're in our late 50's to early 60's (just to put it in perspective ... you know how us old folks can be).  The lighting is rather dark if you have vision issues.  The volume is loud ... likely from all the TV's and the conversations at the tables (noticed noise calming baffles over the central bar area).  Lots of booths to pick from and high chair tables.

We quite enjoyed the environment with all it had to offer.  The service was quick and efficient and very pleasant.  The pizza I had was hot and tasty (only $9 for a pizza on Sunday and Mondays).  Noted other specials depending on the day of the week.  I was pleasantly surprised that I like the place ... even took the time to share our experience with the manager ..... who was delighted that we shared our thoughts with him.

I'm a little tired of Milestones and not happy with Erin Mills pump house .... so you may want to give this business a try."}
{"text":"The restaurant was nice. The guy who sat us and told us about the menu, bathrooms and drinks was very nice. But our service was quite disengaged. I didn't mind as we got a nice welcome and ordered promptly. We had a caesar salad, calamari, fish tacos and pad thai. 
The caesar salad and calamari was great. The calamari came with a creamy sauce and seafood sauce. 
The fish tacos were so good. I had never had anything like it and I really enjoyed it along side its tomato salsa.
The pad thai was ok. Portion was ok. I felt decently satisfied afterwards however I had a horrible stomach ache and ran to the bathroom as soon as I got home.... Not sure if I will be returning."}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday around 6pm. It wasn't busy when we went in but seemed to be picking up when we left around 8.

The Social Palmer drink is to die for! My friend and I each got one with our meals and I would definitely get one (or a lot hehe) again! I had the chicken quesadilla as my main and it was delicious.

Our server was very friendly and we didn't have to wait long for anything.

I would love to try this place out on a friday evening for a more lively atmosphere. I will likely return for more great service, drinks, and food!"}
{"text":"It's nice to have a restaurant like this in the neighbourhood. We've been several times since it opened, and have consistently enjoyed the food, which is fresh-tasting and well prepared. It doesn't get 5 stars, though, because service is very hit and miss and it's extremely loud when even slightly busy. It's hard to have a conversation without yelling. Their beer and wine is reasonably priced, but I wish the cocktails were less hipster and more classic. Sometimes a person just wants a good old fashioned Caesar and not a homemade calamari concoction served with a big chunk of sausage in it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go with friends or date. Works for both. Lots of screens. Cool middle bar. Great vibe and lots of fun. Food I am happy to say is great. Nachos are nicely layered. Wings r good. They have happy hr prices and promos. Pints r a bit small but they're cheaper so it's relevant."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and sweet:

MENU
- pricey for what essentially is pub food
- all over the place; a little bit of everything
- lacklustre in quantity
- the discount on pizzas make it useless to buy it on non-discount days. Why would I pay $15 for a pizza when it costs $10 on another day?

SERVICE
- was okay, at best.
- came w/ 20 people, gave advance notice
- they seemed understaffed for Friday night

FOOD
Unbelievable. For the price, I was expecting a slam dunk of a burger. I ordered the spicy crispy chicken- no sauce, no spice at all. The crispy chicken looked like an oversized deep fried nugget. You can tell the chicken was frozen because it was pretty dense and dry, for something deep fried. For $17, please don't wrap my burger in a paper bag, take a toothpick, a pickle spear, and 30 seconds to work on food presentation. 

I had bacon on my burger that wasn't cooked. I didn't find out until I ate the majority of it. I'm feeling it the next morning. 

I had tried the pad thai which was way too sweet. I really think they need to re-work this item on the menu.. This is usually a \"safe dish\" for most people, but I really wouldn't eat more than two bites of it. Highly disappointing. 

I had nachos and the calamari as appetizers, the quantity was alright for the price; the chips they use aren't the standard grocery-grade chips, they're of a higher quality. The jalapeños are pickled, not fresh. The cheese was alright, quantity was acceptable. The calamari was cooked correctly, and appropriately breaded. 

I ordered something else off the menu which never came out.. Thankfully it didn't appear on the bill, but at the very least, the waiter could've acknowledged it. 

SUMMARY:
I was really disappointed. I was expecting much better, considering this place has some real potential to do better. They need to rework their menu.."}
{"text":"My dad, boyfriend and I wanted to grab a bite after catching a movie. We were all pretty unenthusiastic about eating at the regular chain restaurants so I suggested we check out Browns. I wasn't sure what to expect of the menu but we were all really impressed. The servers were genuinely friendly and knowledgable. I ordered the tuna bowl and my dad and bf both had the potato encrusted halibut. Everything was fresh and flavourful. My tuna was seared perfectly! They also have a great beer selection! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here tonight, around 1030, with my fiancée.  Only about 10 customers.  
We each ordered a beer and nachos.  Ordered the full size with chicken, since we hadn't had dinner.  
My beer (Granville) was fine, but my fiancée's was very watered down (Stella).
Our nachos came, and it was literally a small dinner plate full of about 20 chips, some store bought toppings and about 6-8 small chunks of chicken. The plate was piping hot, but the nachos were lukewarm, and the chicken was cold.  Clearly a microwaved dish.  This is supposedly a $16 portion of nachos.  When I brought this to our waiter's attention, he was nice enough to put a small discount on our bill, but then proceeded to try to convince us that nachos are hard at restaurants (?) and that it was a reasonable size.
We won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was not bad , service was extremely slow apparently due to few members off sick.. Will go back."}
{"text":"So I ate here recently with two friends. The server was welcoming and helpful by turns. I had the house specialty-the chicken teriyaki dragon bowl. It was quiet tasty and you could tell it was freshly made.

I tried a pint of the house craft ale. Next time I'd stick with known brands. We each chose the key lime pie from the compact dessert menu. Wow! We were not disappointed with our choice. The server comped us my dessert as it was my birthday. That was a nice touch. Overall I would recommend Browns and will return."}
{"text":"The place is set up nicely and has ample parking space. We ordered the  rice bowls from the healthy menu. We ordered potato crusted halibut and the blackened chicken. I have to say I was not at all impressed. There was nothing special about the taste and the quantity was definitely on the low side considering price at other similar restaurants."}
{"text":"Had the fish tacos. They were ok. The ratio of fish to toppings wasnt the best. The service was a touch slow. Nice decor and furnishings."}
{"text":"We went for lunch with friends today. I will start with saying the food was very good. However the service was horrible. We delayed ordering originally as we were talking but had to try and get  the wait staff's attention 20 minutes later to place our order. Had to stop someone in passing to order dessert and then again to get the bill. 
My recommendation would be go to Brown's Social Club only when you have lots of time."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but they took off the tuna stack. Super disappointed . They replaced them with tuna tacos, which aren't as appetizing or filling. Won't be going back for a while."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. The decor is nice. The waitress was friendly enough.  The food was really lacking. Management needs to revamp the menu as decor alone will not make me return or recommend this restaurant to anyone. The term brunch is misleading. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Great place to meet friends for a drink or dinner.  Food was good and fresh.  Wait staff was excellent.  Very friendly.

The Bellini was amazing.  It tasted just like a fuzzy peach and came with a fuzzy peach in the side of the glass.  We ended up ordering two.

There are lots of televisions for viewing the game.  No TV audio.  Atmosphere is loud so you'll find yourself chatting at pretty high volume.  Booth seats were very comfortable.

Only two complaints.....

1) Upon arrival, we had to make our way through the smokers who seemed to stand right at the front door.  I guess management either didn't notice or didn't encourage people to stand somewhere else.

2). There are no cappuccino or espresso or latte on the menu."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, family of 5. Food and service did not disappoint. Service is really solid. It's become part of our regular rotation of places to go."}
{"text":"We came here for an early dinner while waiting for our bike to be fixed.  At first we thought that happy hour is until 5pm and we arrived 5:15.  To our surprise, the specials are from 3-6pm.  We tried the social soda and Brown's Lager and they were both very good.  The brown's lager resembles more of an amber beer.  The social soda had a splash of frozen bellini- it tasted very light and refreshing with lots of ice, perfect for summer.  We took advantaged of the 4 dollars off appetizer and tried the Tuna Tacos, Dry (fried/herbed) Ribs, and the Dynamite Roll.  The ribs are delicious, not oily and very flavorful with a surprise enhancement of rosemary.  The Dynamite roll is to die for- so good and a must try.  The tuna tacos could use a bigger piece of tuna but the slaw is seasoned just right- balance of sweet and sour.  The Fries are also delicious.  The best part of this restaurant is the cool and modern ambiance with lots of warmth (nice subway tiles everywhere and neon signs). Oh, and those comfortable chairs, plus very quiet banquettes if you are shy... Our server Lexx is the best....he is attentive and friendly and came to check on us at the right time- either to get condiments or replenish our drinks.  The food was served very quickly after our order.  We can't wait to come back and try other dishes in the menu.  
There are also lots of TV screens to watch your favorite sports.  All in all, the food, service, atmosphere here is terrific and we highly recommend this restaurant. Keep up the good work! Thanks for coming here from the West, where usually things are the best!"}
{"text":"Went to this place because I was very curious and excited to try the place, well that was my mistake.....we walked in and waited, the only person that greeted us in this mostly empty place was the bar tender, next we checked the menu, was very limited for food....the place was pretty nice, we ended up ordering a couple drinks. 
Forced them down because they were terrible, then asked for the bill.
Decided to go across the street to the Mandarin and ate a great meal and had many great drinks there. 
Verdict- change the name to doo doo Browns social and go to mandarin instead, stay away from this place, if a buffet mixes drinks better than a place that should never have bad drinks......go to the buffet every time."}
{"text":"What an absolute gem. Had brunch with a friend and was impressed. Fantastic food, great great service attentive all the thing you look for in a server. Love the decor it is modern but comfortable and warm. Love the set up, bar in the center and tables and booths all around very smart. Give it a try you will not be disappointed. My friend has been a couple of times and she has never been disappointed. So glad we gave a go to restaurant now."}
{"text":"Favourite place for a night out with friends in Mississauga. Food and drinks are great! Also my favourite brunch spot. My only complaint would be that I wish the servers are a little more attentive especially during the busy hours.

Recommendations:
Blueberry Compote Waffles, Eggs Benedict, The New Mr. Pink Martini, Their Pizzas"}
{"text":"Maybe it's the fact that there aren't any other locations of Brows Socialhouse in the east (or in the GTA at least) or maybe it's the cool trendy vibe that capitalizes on the hipster-esque culture of the day, but my visits to Browns have never felt like I'm stepping into a big chain restaurant. It's personal, it feels local, and dare I say cool!

The truth of the matter is that BSH IS in fact a fairly prominent western Canadian chain, but you shouldn't let that fact sully your view of them. They might be polished and have that smooth humming to it that only set processes and best practices can establish. But unlike other major chains, they only let this make them better instead of losing quality and passion to repetition!

My one visit was admittedly for drinks and coffee and they delivered well on that, however, on my next visit I met a colleague for lunch and worked for the day making use of their wifi. For lunch I had the pub burger and subbed out fries for a small caesar salad. The burger came out in a half wrapper similar to the style of places like IN-and OUT burger. The salad was made fresh and as far as salads go, did what it was there to do, taste good and support he burger.

The burger was pretty fresh and fabulous in its own right, certainly a crowd pleaser.

I hope they open more locations around the 905 because I feel this is the chain we deserve here in the burbs and the chain we need!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night with a friend for an impromptu dinner. The outer decor is very modern and trendy. The interior is really nice ... pretty chandeliers, leather and studded seating, a bar in the centre, dim lighting. It also had flat screen tvs all over. It looks a lot like Union Social Eatery. 

I was surprised at how empty the restaurant was. It was about 8:30 when we got there so prime dinner  hour. The waiter told me that its been open for 6 months. Maybe that's why it was empty?!

We were seated and ordered drinks. I ordered a dark and stormy. Tasty but almost no alcohol ... booo! For mains I ordered off the healthy section ... got the blackened chicken bowl and my friend got the chicken carbonera. Everything was tasty but I found the portions slight skimpy. But I guess its better leaving like you wanted more than stuffed if you trying to watch your diet.

Overall I really liked the restaurant. The atmosphere would definitely be better if the place was more packed. Hopefully they attract more customers.

Recommended!"}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch on Canada Day. Was very quiet.

Ordered a fabulous Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl. Incredibly yummy and highly recommended.

Although it was far to hot to sit on the patio, they do have a small one. Nothing fancy and I am not sure I would actually want to use it.

The server, Mike, was excellent; genuine, warm and friendly.

A great spot for lunch or supper"}
{"text":"Love this place. The atmosphere and decor are awesome. Upscale man cave is what comes to mind. Service was on point. Even had a chat with Chef Chris. We had ginger beef to start. I had the almost blackened fish sandwich. My husband had the hickory burger. Potions are big. I couldn't eat it all. Prices are fair. I had a Bellini from the bar. So good. Garnished with fuzzy peach candies. Great place for a date or a night out with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here about 1-15 times now, even for brunch! Honestly its the best food here you can get for a great price, that's well made, tastes good with the ole Americana flare. I was getting a little nostalgic the first time I went since they have a neon sign that says \"Boom goes the dynamite\" and great decor that reminded me of the states. The waiters I usually have are consistent, started to remember us, and are all around generally helpful. The food is great, and good selection for those on special meal plans or diets. We usually get seated immediately and don't wait long for food. 

Notable favorites include:
The grapefruit martini (with fresh grapefruit juice).
The salad with goat cheese for most sides.
Their eggs benedict for brunch.
Their fish n chips.
The oreo dessert cake thing in a mason jar.
Their almond rice, oh. my. gosh.

New items have been added to the menu! I've attached their new brownie exclusive."}
{"text":"This was one of our favourite spots to eat. No more. 
I tried the potato crusted fish bowl with jasmine rice and salad.
My salad had no flavour except a sweet dressing. Fish taste had a burnt taste. Rice was plain no season or flavour. There was no imagination with this dish.
My husband said he didn't enjoy his burger.
My daughter had a grilled chicken with salad and found that it had no taste/flavour
The environment is so nice along with our waitress.
I suspect they do not have a experienced chef right now"}
{"text":"Service was fast, attentive, and friendly. Food was good, but a little on the pricey side for what you get. Overall, a bit more of an upscale and modern version of a traditional sports bar cum local hangout. Would go back."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday night for dinner, and for some reason it did not fall on me to make reservations.  We were told it would be a 25-30 minutes wait, there was only one couple ahead of us so we didn't think it would take too long. We ended up waiting over an hour. Makes reservations people, otherwise you will wait!

Walking in, I loved the vibe. It was a mix of modern chic yet rustic charm, totally me. The TV's were small so it didn't give it a sports bar feel, yet the centre of the restaurant had a large bar area enough to fit half the restaurant.  We opted for the booth area, it was comfortable, but cold especially if you are seated by the door. 

Yes: I ordered the crispy calamari to start, and it was delicious.  Perfectly seasoned, light of oil yet crispy. For my main I went with the Tahitian Tuna Bowl. It was really good, I'm very precise with my salads as I find a lot of places tend to overdress their salads. Browns killed it, the arugula/kale mix was crisp and fresh paired with the tender tuna. I loved the goat cheese beet salad that was also included. It was sweet and salty which is my guilty pleasure. 

No: I was lucky enough(or not) to try other items such as the French onion soup and Blackened chicken. Both dishes we're ridiculously salty.  We opted for the housemade key lime pie for desert, and I could not for the life of me finish it. That is unheard of, I love my deserts, but there was a very strong taste of ginger in the crust. It tasted great at first bite, but got overwhelmingly spicy as I got halfway through the cake.

Verdict: Great, I love Browns and look forward to coming back. There's just something about the decor that just draws me back. Tahitian bowl was also delish and you can't go wrong with $5 special lager."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised.

We came by on a lazy birthday Sunday for brunch. Super friendly attentive service and the most amazing chicken club I've ever had.

Felt like good value too.

We'll be back! Yay!"}
{"text":"Been here plenty of times and I always order the exact same thing. My favourite spicy crispy chicken sandwich, with gravy for the fries. My ultimate junk food craving! The spicy mayo is a little mild which I prefer to be hotter. Their fries are perfectly crispy and golden. Did I mention how yummy their gravy is?? Perfection. Our appetizers came in quite quickly, but our mains we had to wait a little longer. There's plenty of TV screens to catch a game or two. I must try one of their happy hour drinks, next time!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch on a lazy Sunday at noon.  It was still quite quiet and we were seated right away in a cozy booth.  Warm grown furniture and floors make for a nice welcome  ambiance.

Ordered coffee, grapefruit juice, prosciutto eggs bene, and  grilled chicken wild arugula salad.  Food was good although the portion size on the salad might be considered small considering what you pay.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Will come by for dinner one of these days...."}
{"text":"Come for the casual vibe with a group but dont have too high expectations for the food because is just a notch above average. Wings were pretty small and unbattered. Don't order the Asian food dishes - unless you like the unauthentic kind. I've had better tacos elsewhere. Pizza and calamari was alright. Not a bad hangout spot for this area. Group of us went bowling across the street and headed to this place for a light meal."}
{"text":"The menu and atmosphere were pretty cool. Dim and intimate but not claustrophobic. Our server though was a bit too cool, and could have actually worked a bit harder and been a bit more attentive and the food was just OK, comparable to a Kelsey's with more interesting food names."}
{"text":"Very cool ambience
Didn't know it wss a chain
Good food and drinks
They have diff shots on special each night
Great place for sports
And the seats are super comfy 
They location kind of sucks though"}
{"text":"Really knowledgeable and friendly staff. 
Great casual atmosphere. 
Food made with fresh ingredients. Loved my black ended fish sandwich.
Awesome place to go for a date, or to hang out with some buddies."}
{"text":"Just saw the place looking for a quick lunch.  Fish tacos - fresh greens, larger than expected- excellent. French onion soup and salad , garlic toast - all three very good.  Service excellent.
Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wowed by their portion size! Tasty food with a nice presentation. Great place to have dinner with friends and family...it's one of those places that you can dress up for a date or drop by after running errands with the kids. Decor is unique. Staff is friendly and so is their service. We will definitely return to try their brunch menu. Tip: kid's menu is not available but is available on request."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit of a gem in the middle of a suburban shopping strip. I met up with a friend for Sunday brunch expecting it to be busy but it was pretty quiet. We were immediately seated and ordered the $5 mimosas. The server was very polite and returned regularly to check on us while we chatted away but she just let take our time with the menu. We both ordered the prosciutto eggs benedict which was delicious. The eggs were perfectly poach so the yolk was just runny enough when pierced. The prosciutto was crispy which was perfect with the egg. The side of potatoes was a great accompaniment. The regular menu is quite extensive but I didn't pay much attention this time since I wanted brunch. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Tried the Hollywood burger with poutine and both were reasonably good.

Will return to sample more of the menu.

Burger pub style decent 7/10
Poutine Toronto style decent 6.5/10"}
{"text":"Nice place, several booths and tables around a bar in the middle of the room. Lots of TVs on the walls. Was not busy on Saturday when we went which was nice. Service was good. They have a good $5 draft and wine glass. Their local social wine bottle is also only $20. We had the calamari which was not bad but a bit on the pricier side $12.95 for a relatively small amount."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers. The place was busy - good thing to call and reserve if you have a big group like we did. 

The decor is cosy and dim. The seating arrangements were not cramped. 

The food took 40 minutes to arrive - which is a bit on the slow side for a big group order. 

I had the blackened chicken with rice. It was good but not worth the money for the portion and quality. 

Most of the dishes are fusion - Indian, Asian and western. 

Compare to other places like Moxies or Harpers, the portion here are less and price point about the same."}
{"text":"I think this place has a lot of potential. The staff was friendly, service was quick and effecient. The place had a really nice ambiance, classy but casual. It felt cosy and was not loud as well. The seating was comfortable as we had a booth. There were TVs you could see from every angle. We ordered the calamari appetizer, the fish and chips, fish taco and chicken fettucine. The calamari was tasty delicate and delicious. The fish on the fish and chips was sweet, delicate and tasty: however, the batter was soggy on the bottom. Otherwise it was crispy, tasty but a bit heavy. The fish tacos were perfect, tasty and fresh. The pasta sauce was delicious, amazing flavours but the pasta was undercooked. The chicken was perfect, tender and well spiced/blackened. Overall a good experience with some improvements needed."}
{"text":"I held my birthday celebration dinner at his location earlier this year and I had a wonderful time. 

Its decorated really nice. I'd say it's a bit on the dressier side, with an older crowd (mainly 35+), not what I had expected. A lot of the customers were dressed up. 

Reservations were a breeze, they were kind enough to let us reserve 20 people 3 weeks in advance on a Friday evening. This place is very small, Id say less than 85 seats. 

The service was good, orders arrived within a good timely manner (15-20 minutes during it's dinner peak time)

Many of my guests had ordered pastas, most were unsatisfied. Complaints about it were either too dry or drowned in too much cheese. My advice to you, don't order any pastas. 

Burgers all turned out excellent. A think layer of juicy meat, cooked just right for those who like it medium rare. A bunch of us meat lovers got the PUB BURGER (about 7) no complaints here. 

Prices are fair, place was clean, don't worry about carpooling, there plenty of parking spaces. I will return soon."}
{"text":"We just got back from an early dinner here, wanted to avoid the mothers day rush! To start, when you walk in the atmosphere is really cool, I like the decor and the lighting. Very clean and good use of space. The staff was really friendly, not snobby, and I appreciate the classy attire. The menu had a good amount of options but not so big that you feel overwhelmed in choosing. I got pizza without the shrimp and the waitress was really good in asking if I wanted chicken or tofu to substitute. My mom got the fish and chips. Both meals came very quickly and piping hot! The food was really good, and it didn't come off too chain-like. The prices are mid range, got a great deal on the pizza, on Sundays and Mondays all pizza is 9.00 so that's a pretty sweet deal. I would come back here."}
{"text":"I could go on about the food service in the corner but a lot of other reviewer's can do a better job than me. 
I love this place just because I know how NOT to have the music blasting so loud you can't hear the person next to you. 
Hey every other place that thinks to be cool are you listening up ? ? Earls, Moxies, etc turn down the music
You can have the music on without it being intrusive"}
{"text":"We've been here on two occasions and have to say that overall we were pleasantly surprised.  There are two major standouts for me with this place.

1.  The menu doesn't try to be all things to all people.  They are proud of the fact that they make 90% (quoted by their staff) of their food in-house.  The menu is definitely influenced by the West Coast culture of lighter fair involving various pan-Asian flavours and techniques.  The menu is very small and focused as opposed to sprawling over several pages a-la-Kelsey's, Montana's and any other big box restaurant.

2. The drinks are cheap.  I ordered a pint of their in-house lager and wasn't disappointed with either the quality or the price.  We're not big drinkers but I see that they offer discounted pints and shots virtually every day of the week.  

One more thing, I enjoy lighter fair when it's flavourful but there's one item on their menu that I can't resist.  If it was socially acceptable, I would order their Pad Thai with a side of their house made gravy.  Without using any hyperbole, I have to say that their gravy is the best that I've ever had!   Try it with an order of fish and chips and tell me I'm wrong!

The only reason it does't get the full five stars is that on one occasion, the service was excellent, on our 2nd trip there, the service was downright rude.  I guess everyone's entitled to a bad day now and then.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions. The interior looks good but the place is actually pretty small when you look at it from the inside. It has a modern sports bar feel but the selection on tap is pretty limited.

The food was alright, nothing to rave about. If you're looking for a place to get food and drinks this is a good choice if you don't want to go too far but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"So it was my 1st visit to Browns social house 
And I must say , I really enjoyed my visit !
Great atmosphere kinda dark but great mood lighting . Great bar top tables and even booths 
the back wall with the stones and liquor sign 
Reminded myself and my buddy of one of our favorite movies . Kinda 70s look with the stone and brown wooden tables ...very chique ...
Anyways other then the decor ...
The food from what we had which was 
A Burger , A Pizza , ribs and wings were all great 
The wings tasted Great but we're pretty small 
The waitress said they were hormone free ...
I guess I like my chickens on Steroids cause I like em big and juicy .
Although they were small they were still delicious 
So i can't really complain .
All in all ....
Great place Great food and I'd definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and great service but the food was mediocre.
I got the steak and sushi combo and was kind of dissapointed. I chose a spicy tuna roll and had my steak medium rare.
The roll had too much rice and the rice was a bit overcooked and wet. The tuna is just canned tuna so theres not much to say about it.
The steak had good flavor but was a bit tough. It was served on top of some stir fired nappa cabbage that again had great flavor but was undercooked. 

The combo costed $26 or $27 which is a decent price for both steak and sushi. But I don't reccomend it, it's not worth trying.

On a side note, my friend had the chicken sandwich with fries and he really enjoyed both, so maybe the menu is a bit of a hit and miss.

We also had the thai soup and that was really good"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere and the decor of the restaurant something more upscale and still a touch of hipster, really feels different compared to a lot of the chains in the area and is a welcome addition to the neighbourhood. The food was really good and the calamari was exceptional, the burgers were great and give any of the other restaurants a good run for their money. The thing that is hard to get used too is how attentive and friendly the staff is they are there to help you make a decision ensure your drink is never empty and that you are always having a good time. I will be going back again real soon!"}
{"text":"I decided to choose this spot for a brunch with eleven friends on a Sunday. All of us were pretty damn excited about it. 

This is not going to be a good review in the least. And in my experience this is the worst I've ever been treated at a restaurant.

No one greeted me when I came in so I decided to just walk over to my table. I informed my server that we were now only 11 people and she responded with an abrupt \"eleven what?\" accompanied with an irritated face. 

All of my guests arrived by 11:20am so we wanted to order drinks but no one came to our table. So I decided to hail a waitress over. I asked her if we could order drinks. 

She actually rolled her eyes at me. Did that just take place???? Never in my life have I seen a server do that. I need to mention too that the place wasn't busy at all.. 

We all felt the vibe. It actually was one of our main topics of discussion during Brunch. Now let's move onto the food.. really really bad.. Four of my guests ordered the Eggs Benedict and the yolk was cooked????

Many of the girls didn't enjoy their meal. 

I order the Chicken Caesar Salad and it was tasteless. You're not fooling customers when you use old lettuce that has brown marks on it. 

Chicken Caesar was just blackened with absolutely no seasoning. Salad as I said had bits of old brown leaves. Breadstick was lacking in garlic and just flavour period.

The owners of this establishment need to be very worried about the clientele. It's not nice when your customers feel like you've bothered them by coming by.

They offered us each a $5 coupon for waiting so long for our food but you know what?, I would have rather had a great experience and visit again with friends than your coupon.

I will not be back..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Brown's for the second time, after receiving a gift card for leaving feedback after our first visit. Now, the first time we went, things weren't great (our waitress was rude, the food was meh), but they weren't terrible. We both had burgers, we had a plate of calamari that was oddly lemony and strange, and then a pot of oreo cheesecake that was in a mason jar. The burgers had very little meat, and my boyfriend called them \"lettuce and bread burgers\" because of the ratio of those things to the actual patty. He didn't like the calamari at all, and he had just had the most amazing calamari in BC just a few weeks before. The oreo pot was the saving grace of the evening, because it was delicious, albeit hard to get at.

We went to Browns on the 30th, the last day of undergrad classes for us (EVER!). We had a big lunch earlier in the day, so we decided to split two appetisers, and grab a dessert. No drinks for us, because he was driving and I wasn't going to drink without him. Anyway, we grabbed the Dragon Roll and the General Tso's chicken, and we decided to grab the oreo cheesecake pot for dessert. We regretted every minute.

The dragon roll was a mess. The rice was overcooked and goopy (and warm!), there was nothing besides a tempura shrimp as a filling (no cucumber, or anything else), the mayo sauce drizzled atop the roll was almost the same colour as the rice, and the \"aromatic soy\" they give you for dipping is just soy sauce watered down with vinegar. It was awful, but the waiter was too busy and we were starving, so my SO avoided the sauce, and I just ate a lot of ginger to make it okay. The chicken wasn't awful, but it was not General Tso's-- I couldn't tell what the flavour was, but my boyfriend nailed it when he asked me if I'd ordered Orange Chicken by mistake. It tasted like marmalade was poured on to it, and had the same citrusy tang that the calamari did. Whoever is in the back really likes to abuse citrus.

Browns fails miserably at Asian \"fusion,\" the food is disgraceful. I was so disappointed, but my boyfriend expected it.

The oreo pot was smaller than last time, and sealed into the pot with an EXTREMELY hard oreo crust. Seriously, I had to put some effort behind my spoon to crack the top. The whip cream was also really bland, and because we couldn't dig all the way to the bottom, we essentially had to eat flavourless fluff to reach anything that was half-decent.

Something interesting that we noticed at Browns, was that they ask you if you're new visitors or not. On the way to the bathroom, I noticed that the \"new\" visitors' table numbers were written on a small chalkboard, and the waiters payed more attention to them. Once I got back to the table, we paid the bill, and then the waiter took our receipt back-- including the slip that encourages you to offer feedback. From what my boyfriend and I noticed, the place was only busy during reverse happy hour, and people were only buying drinks or ordering burgers. The burgers seem to be the only halfway decent thing on the menu, though extremely overpriced. You can buy a much more filling burger with sides at The Works or the Burgernator for less than what you'd have to pay at Browns.

Not going back, neither should you, and you should be suspicious of any really positive reviews you see here."}
{"text":"Trying to have dinner after 10pm on. Sunday in Mississauga is an interesting dilemma. To begin with I don't believe there's one decent Japanese restaurant opened after 10pm on. Sunday and there's not many other places that are opened, at least not in South Mississauga. 

I have been to Browns when it first opened and I remember not having a great experience at that time. It could have been opening time pains but I remember it being loud, with slow service. Fast forward a year later on a Sunday at 10:15 and the experience is much different. 

The interior of Browns is warm and somewhat intimate. The hand oil the tables every week and they do feel smooth. There are lots of booths and TV's to distract your attention away from your phone and when it's not crazy busy you can also have audible conversation. 

The food is good and there's a wide variety. And if you're not too sure about the classic apps, then entree, there are lots of starters that will allow you to create a tapas menu. Service was great with only a couple of people serving. So if you're late night hungry in South Miss, Browns is a great choice. They're open until midnight."}
{"text":"Sat at the Bar and ordered a drink right away, it took 25 minutes to get because all of the Glasses were Dirty.

We were going to eat, but between the slow service and the \"RIDICULOUS\" Prices, we Paid and left.

Good Watermelon Martini though."}
{"text":"Asian fusion fare under the name \"Browns\" does not exactly say \"authentic\", but seeing how successful this chain has been in Vancouver, I decided to give it a try. 

Very cool decor, tiled with hanging lights and a spectacular looking bar, that also does not say much for the menu, but it was neat. 

I opened with the ahi tacos that had a great shell. Almost eggy, but with a great crisp that seemed freshly fried. The cowgirl bowl had a well seasoned blackened chicken but a really small portion... I could have finished the chicken in a few bites. I enjoyed the almond coconut rice on the side. 

I can see myself coming back for the tacos and maybe a drink with friends, but will probably be going for a bigger meal elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to Browns in April for two friends' birthday dinner. The atmosphere was great - cute gastropub, nice setup, DJ spinning and it was busy but not crazy busy for a Saturday night. I ordered the fish tacos, which were just okay. They were a bit bland and missing something but couldn't quite point out what. My husband's dragon bowl was flavourful though and a good portion for the price. I would come back to try other things on the menu and for drinks with some friends next time."}
{"text":"So I've made 2 visits to this restaurant over the last couple of weeks. My first was a scouting trip in advance of my wife's annual concert. I was served by a absolutely delight young waitress named \"Amanda\". She was bubbly & smart-whitted & appeared to genuinely like her job. The food was good but not great. I had the Pad Thai (a little runny) as the main course. I also had a dessert that was off the charts good!! I think it was the caramel sticky toffee dessert. 

I went back for a second time on Nov 28th & as luck would have it my group of 20 people were served by the same \"Amanda\"! She was very friendly & polite, the same as last time. My group seemed to all enjoy the food & service. I selected the Hot Crispy sandwich w a side salad. Both were delicious. All-in-all both experiences were well done & the food is worth the purchase. 

What I thought was interesting is the Manager (Gary) & the waitress seemed to both enjoy their jobs & worked hard at trying to please the guests. A refreshingly different experience. 

This is a do-over for me."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Browns Social house. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service was amazing. We got such a WONDERFUL server! Lex made my visit feel so warm and welcoming. He was very knowledgeable and very understanding. I had the pad Thai which was not good (TBH) and my sister had the dragon bowl. Her dragon bowl was FILLED with delicious flavours. The drinks were reasonably priced as well. I'll definitely be coming back to have that yummy dragon bowl"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I did an eye-roll when my h.s. friends suggested Browns as a gathering spot.  I thought it would be another Earls/Moxies/Milestones/Kelsey's/Casey's/Pickle Barrel/all other suburban chain restaurants.  However, this place surprised me!

Atmosphere:  dim, reclaimed look, mix between a bar/sports bar/restaurant.  This West Coast chain would definitely fit in downtown and would do equally well in a mall-setting!

Food:  I only had the Halibut Tacos ($12/2, apps) and a mojito ($8.50, pretty tall glass).  I wasn't that hungry, so the tacos were sufficient in size.  As far as the drink was concerned, it was a fairly good serving for the price.

If at all possible, I really try to avoid chain-restos, so I haven't been to any of the above mentioned places in years.  However, from what I do remember, what sets Browns apart is that there are daily drink specials and even a $5 everyday drink menu.

Entire food menu is online and it consisted of the usual suspects:  salads, burgers, pizza, pasta, and some \"Social Bowls\" which were a mix of rice + salad + a protein in a decent serving size. 

Server was friendly, not snooty, so that was a bonus!

I would not hesitate to visit again if I was looking for a place to enjoy a drink...with some food."}
{"text":"This will become part of my regular rotation. I've been here twice and it did not disappoint. In fact, both visits were in one week since I could not wait to return after my first experience.
The Social Soda is a winner and will be my 'regular' drink whenever I visit.
I tried the carbonara on one visit and a burger on the other. The pasta was good but there are so many other exciting things on the menu I doubt I will have it again. The burger was very good; I could see me trying this again.
All the starters I tried on both visits were great.
The restaurant is filled with young professionals.. seems very tailored to this crowd. Nothing to complain about, just a heads up. 
Really, just go try this new gem in Mississauga/Oakville for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Basically what it is a Social house with good food and drinks.  The prices are pretty steep for small portion as they should be for these kind of restaurants.  Wouldn't go here if you wanted to eat a lot of food"}
{"text":"We visited a hopping Browns Social House last night around 6:00 p.m. It took about twenty minutes to get a table which is fine without a reservation.

Our server was quite friendly particularly considering how overtaxed he was.
My Thai chicken soup was a little more creamy than I would like but on the plus side of O.K. My fish tacos, which seem to be the rage everywhere these days, were quite disappointing featuring toppings that would have been more at home at Taco Bell.

It turns out BSH is a chain from out west and this makes the mediocrity less of surprise. In truth only the ultra cool ( although somehow misleading because it does say \"restaurant\" to me) exterior of the building was a highlight."}
{"text":"Horrible service.. SLOW!!! 20 minutes to change a keg and 51min to deliver appetizers. We had to walk up to the bar a couple times to order drinks and ask why the delay was so long.."}
{"text":"6 of us went on a Friday night. The food was great, drinks were good and we really enjoyed ourselves.
The nachos were awesome; corn and black beans ALL the way through the layers.
The burgers, and beef dip were great.
A friend said the Calamari was the 2nd best IF not the best he had ever had.
The key lime pie I really liked, but it has coconut in it so that not may be to everyone's liking.
Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here a number of times since it opened and initially I was quite pleased. However, the last few meals have been very disappointing. The chicken salad had a piece of chicken that is only probably about 3 ounces and I had to send it back twice because it was burnt. In my most recent experience, I ordered the chicken quesadilla which had two times more jalapeños in them than the chicken and was pretty close inedible. On top of which, the guacamole that it came with was very brown and clearly was not fresh. When the server asked how I was enjoying the meal I told her and showed her all of the jalapeños that I had pulled out and all she could say was \"oh\"."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Browns Social a half dozen times over the last year. The service tends to be pretty good, atmosphere is always bustling. I'd say the food is above average, well thought out recipes but maybe not perfectly flavoured or spiced. It could be better. The overall experience is always quite positive which moves this from a 3 star to a 4 star. It's well priced and I feel if the food quality improved a little this could definitely be a 5 star from me.

They have decent gluten-free choices for those with or dinning with celiac individuals."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a semi-large group (7 people). We had reservations but they didn't seem to have the tables ready, so when our 7th arrived they had to come and add a chair for her. 
Drinks and food were pretty much on par price-wise for what I expected from a nicer chain restaurant. They make an awesome peach Bellini too - so delicious! 
I ordered halibut crusted with potato flakes, and it was okay. The fish itself was excellent but the potato flakes gave it a weird flavor. They do have many gluten free options, which is great, though I am still finding that a lot of restaurants have several gfree entrees and one (or no) gfree appetizers. It would be great if they could add a few more so gfree people can have appetizers with their gluten-eating friends :) 
Overall I enjoyed my meal, my drink and the ambience was quite nice. My main complaints are that the music was WAY too loud (we had to yell for the entire dinner), their lack of preparation for our group size and the lack of gfree appetizers."}
{"text":"Went yesterday for a birthday party.

I want to make one thing clear from the outset, and that is that our server was great! Super nice guy and pretty attentive.

Now, this is my first time eating here, I didn`t even know this place existed until yesterday (but then, I`m never in Oakville anyway). The party was for 9 p.m. and we had a group of about 20 people. We got there around 9:15 and although busy with our group, it wasn`t a full house otherwise for a Friday night.

When it came to ordering, my boyfriend and I ordered the Halibut tacos as our appetizer, the club chicken burger for me, and the spicy crispy chicken burger for him.

This is where it kind of started going downhill.

Firstly, our Halibut tacos never arrived. Ever. At all. Not wanting to make a fuss since we were at someone`s birthday party, we just let it go.

Secondly, because it was a fairly large group of people, we knew the food would take a while to come out as they want everyone to start eating around the same time. No problem. Forty or so minutes later our mains finally arrived.

My burger and fries arrived cold. Again, didn`t want to make a show so just ate it. My boyfriend`s burger buns were cold and his burger had bacon strips in it. The bacon wasn`t fully cooked and several strips were still fleshy and pink. We don`t know how much of it he ate before he realized but he developed a stomach ache after. If there`s probably one item of food that should never be semi-cooked, it`s a pork product.

Needless to say, we likely will not be coming back here to eat. The menu, although decent, is kind of all over the place between tacos, burgers, pad thai, and a bit on the pricier side.

Again, had it been supremely busy, I would`ve understood the blunders. But considering we were really the only people there aside from a few other couples on a Friday night, kind of inexcusable."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere if you want a quiet more intimate setting while enjoying some night life. It's a great local spot. Food is good and price is competitive. Overall, good experience."}
{"text":"Normally enjoy having a beer here.  But my last visit on St Patrick's day was met with watered down Guinness.   Browns is never packed so it's not as if they have to conserve their supply.  

I guess I know why it was an easy place to get into during St. Patrick's day without any lineup..."}
{"text":"We've been going to Browns Socialhouse Erin Mills since they opened. The decor is quite contemporary and more upscale than your usual sports bar, however they do have large screens with games playing all the time.

The layout is really interesting, with the bar in the centre of the restaurant. There are lots of booths, including big ones for larger parties. There are also regular tables and high tops with bar stools.

The restaurant and the washrooms are always very clean and tidy.

Every time we've been there, the service has been good and the staff are always very friendly and attentive.

The menu isn't large, but there are quite a few interesting options. I love that on Sunday and Monday they have all their pizzas for $10 and that includes the option of a gluten-free crust.

Some of our favourites are the 3-meat cowboy pizza which has pepperoni, bacon, sausage, mushrooms and corn. I didn't think I'd be a big fan of the corn on there but it works. We also love the social bowls, which are with rice, veggies and a protein (the tuna is amazing). These also offer a low carb option where you get cabbage instead of the rice. 

The drinks are a reasonable price and the house wine is pretty good for around $20 a bottle.

We have yet to try the brunch on the weekend, but I'll update my review when we do.

All in all, this place is a keeper!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for two years. Great people, atmosphere, food, and service! Just opened a patio and are on Skip the Dishes too! Have great specials everyday as well as their Social Hours. Come by and you will become a regular."}
{"text":"Went to Brown's recently with a group of girlfriends for a Sunday morning brunch. I love the gastro pub feel they have achieved in the interior. Very comfortable and as the name suggests a \"social house\". Truth be told, we spent a good 4 hours there on a very cold and rainy Sunday (restaurant was empty and we tipped well).

The menu is fun and unique. I always have the hardest time choosing. The girls got the breakfast burrito and I got the margherita pizza. Because when pizza is on special, you DO NOT say no to it. 

Pizza was just fine. A bit on the smaller side than I was expecting. Mostly because I love pizza and want all of it. But for $10, I had no complaints.

The only reason this is a 4 star review is truly about the waitress. Overall we were not impressed. Right from the start she was very standoffish and aloof with us. Thats fine, we're not a high maintenance group of girls anyways. It was just the only thing that stood out as being a negative. Otherwise, thumbs up to Brown's Social House."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Ample amount of TVS. 
Good service. 
The street tacos were mostly cabbage and very vinaigrette tasting. 
The soup was delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a dinner date with another couple.  They wanted us to choose the place as the other couple were coming from Markham. We chose Browns. 

We've never been there before however we've drove past it on many occasions and they were always busy. Tonight we got a chance to see why. 

food - excellent. The health nut mango chicken salad was excellent, I had the burger and fries (excellent) and my wife had the halibut taco (great slaw but quite short on halibut). 
service - excellent.  Attentive and authentic 
ambience - excellent. Great decor, casual dining, tons of screens. It felt like a sports bar, dining restaurant and a cool hang out place all in one. 

Think we found a great gem."}
{"text":"Modern restaurant with great food and great service. Prices are higher but quality is there. Will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Good pub food. Excellent desserts. Love their brownie with ice cream and key lime pie.  Open late"}
{"text":"Excellent Customer Service. Wait Staff and General Manager were very courteous and Friendly. 
 Food was excellent and very reasonably priced. The decor inside is beautiful too. 
Will definitely be back and recommend it to Friends."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends who said this place was good.
From the moment we walked in, I was quite impressed with the decor / atmosphere.
Modern yet chic.

The staff were very friendly and that added to the positive vibe.

Now for the food.

My order of chicken wings was very salty! So salty that I sent it back...and ordered a Tahitian Tuna Bowl based on a fellow Yelper's review...

That was excellent I must say.

My dinner partner had the fish N chips and the fish taco. He enjoyed the tacos more.

Will come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Chic, cool decor & relaxed atmosphere.

I highly recommend the grapefruit & basil martini - absolutely amazing & made with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice at a great price!

I didn't get to try their food menu - although their brunch looks fantastic!

Staff was very friendly & all smiles.
A great Mississauga/Oakville spot."}
{"text":"Good menu, and not bad beer selection ( for Canada) - but the service at the bar was dour, I felt like I did something to offend her.  She was pretty busy and the manager just sat on the corner socializing, and then when the friend left, he brought out dinner for himself - it was just a very weird vibe.  IMO the Manager should be fired - just did not get it.
Ordered a burger ( no option as to how it should be cooked) - it was OK - small patty - not too moist, OK flavor, otherwise completely unremarkable, but not for $15!! -- basically the worst $15 burger I have ever had.  Poutine was OK, fries hot, curds were cold so they did not get melty.....  all in all - no reason to go back."}
{"text":"What to get? 

Come here for drinks...Their social drinks of course! 

A social lager (16oz!), social red or white wine (6oz!) or social soda (1 oz!) all for $5 when you come from 2-5 pm or after 9 pm everyday. Hello!??

And their social reds and whites aren't bad too! I had a social red and it was from Jackson-triggs! A bottle of a social red will only be $20! Not bad for having a girls night out, let's say and going home happy that you didn't spend that much on bottles on bottles of wine at the bar!

On weekends, you can also get $1.50 off Caesars too! Sweet! 

Didn't try the food so can't comment on whether the food is good!

Last tip??

Whether you're celebrating something or just need a drink to de-stress, I like browns social hour - just in time for a drink for only $5 and you get a good amount of wine per glass!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this restaurant 3 times now and each time didn't disappoint.  First time I came here was to celebrate my bday which was pretty risky considering it was my first visit but they were able to accommodate our party of 18 which was great. 

My last visit was on a Saturday night and there were 2 of us. We waited at the bar for about 15 minutes - had a drink so it was no big deal.

I had the roast beef French dip with the cowgirl salad and it totally hit the spot.  The beef was tender and flavourful and the salad was surprisingly tasty that I didn't even miss the French fries I had contemplating ordering at first.  

My hubby ordered the pub burger and also really enjoyed it.  The food was and the service was friendly and I would return again. There are menu items that are a little more on the pricier side but I think it's possible to find something at different price points."}
{"text":"With snappy decor, prompt service and affordable prices, this place brings a refreshing change to the otherwise bland dining scene of South West Mississauga.

Our group of three as fairly famished after a bowling tournament so we ordered fish tacos,  burger and a wonton noodle soup. And  finished off with a very generous brownie.

I personally liked the layout and enjoy hanging out here if in the area. Good place for anytime of the week!"}
{"text":"I go here pretty often and every time the service has been good and fast. I definitely like some items more than others, but overall the food is good. The Dragon Bowl is a MUST TRY!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone; it doesn't feel like a chain restaurant even though it is!"}
