{"text":"If you're looking for a really nice happy hour with a chic ambience and great food and drink specials, stop in at Ohio City's Light Bistro. The bar food menu items are $5 during happy hour, and it's not a small list. There is a nice range of choices from a mac and cheese of the day to a specialty burger. We had the very tasty oven-dried tomato pesto flatbread and the fried clams. There are featured wine pours (a red and a white) for $5, outrageously inexpensive beer and many interesting cocktail specials, too. And bonus - it goes past 6pm! Happy Hour is offered Monday - Friday from 2:30 - 7pm. Of course, the dinner menu looked sumptuous too, but we had a date with Ingenuity Fest.

We used to go to Light Bistro all the time for the Vegetarian dinners, but thought they had discontinued them. We were happy to find out they do still run them, they just do not send out emails any more. So we liked them on Facebook to be in the know.

We also learned about their upcoming new restaurant in Hudson, Peachtree Southern Kitchen & Cocktails, which is now on our list to try when it opens this November. We wish them the best on their new endeavor."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or your money. Terrible service, unless you don't mind waiting over 25 minutes for your round of drinks and 40+ minutes between courses. In our  party of 7 if your food wasn't cold it was sure to be burned. When the manager asked how our experience was we answered honestly and instead of apologizing he was defensive and filled with excuses. Worse dining experience I've had in a long time. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service is great!  You can sit outside and people watch!  Happy Hour has great selections at low prices!  The food is delicious with appropriate portions!   The lamb burger is delicious!   We go here often to celebrate special occasions!"}
{"text":"We should have known when we could get last minute reservations and it was empty inside. The food was mediocre at best, we had the scallops and shrimp which were good, but the risotto was completely flavorless  we got the beignets which were great, but I still left hungry unwilling to attempt other food . We also had the fried chicken which was bland and really dry. For the price I would never go back, a shame given what people used to say about this cute little restaurant.  I expected better."}
{"text":"We visited during Restaurant Week. Had no problem getting a reservation. Loved the complimentary valet. Service itself was on point. Appreciated the darker napkins that were brought after the hostess assessed our outfits. The food, however, was lackluster at best. I chose to go off their prix fixe menu for restaurant week. The first course of rock shrimp was the best dish of the evening. Second course of chicken with spinach, mushrooms and potatoes was generic. The brown gravy tasted like it was out of a jar. The beef carpaccio pizza was mostly flavorless & desperately needed any kind of seasoning. The pomme frites were too thin & fast food-like. The burger with bacon & egg, while tasting good, was cooked far beyond the medium well ordered and was almost too dry to eat, even with the assistance of the egg yolk & ketchup. Our dessert, chocolate chip cookies, definitely had been microwaved and were too hot, but unevenly so. While I definitely have had worse, Light Bistro's menu was blasé enough to keep me away in the future."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Light Bistro. I just can't understand why the place wasn't packed on a beautiful Friday night at 7:00 pm.

The service was top notch, highly attentive, courteous, knowledgeable, and most of all friendly.  The food was outstanding. I opted for the Honey Ham and Cheddar Croquettes / Romesco Sauce (traditional tapas), Sauteed Rock Shrimp / White Bean Puree / Fennel / Toasted Garlic (American tapas), while my date chose the Albondigas - Lamb Meatballs / Tomato Sauce / Mozzarella / Provolone pizza. The variety and balance of flavors in each item was truly amazing. We even found the flavor of our mojitos paired nicely with the myriad flavors of the meal.

Our order came promptly, was properly prepared, and the presentation looked like you would expect from a top-level restaurant. 

Our only complaint is that we didn't have room for dessert. Oh well, I guess we'll just have to go back. ;-)"}
{"text":"I had originally wanted to try Lola's, but after finding out that you need to make reservations like a year in advance, I settled on Light Bistro.  And honestly, it was probably all for the better.  The food is amazing and it's the trendiest hole in the wall you'll ever eat in.  The menu can be intimidating at first.  It's broken down into two parts, a \"taste\" menu consisting of small entrees and a larger \"share\" menu, which features slightly bigger entrees (but definitely not big enough to share).  I went with the small items on the taste menu and it was fantastic.  The duck with udon noodles in broth and the goat cheese flat bread were winners.  The scallops, however, were salty and a little too chewy.  The desserts are really the highlight though, we ordered the warm chocolate chip cookies, and they'll make you go OM NOM NOM NOM NOM.  They tasted just like the ones my mom makes.  I would take off a star for the scallops, but the desserts and other entrees more than made up for it.  All around, a great place for dinner."}
{"text":"Light Bistro is an incredible Ohio City restaurant. Located inside an old home next to St. Ignatius, Light Bistro has hands down one of Cleveland's best chefs. The food is absolutely incredible. The interior is full of atmosphere, with three rooms accommodating diners. There is a bar area, a main dining room, and a back dining room. There might be an upstairs dining room, but I'm not sure because I saw a staircase, but didn't go up. From reading several reviews of the place, including the other Yelp reviews, I understand that Parker's New American Bistro once filled in this space. I can't compare the two, as I never had the opportunity to eat at Parker's, but I can say that the food is worth driving from anywhere in NE Ohio. The emphasis here is on small plates. You can get tapas, small plates, entree sized plates, and tasting menus. We mixed two small plates and an entree sized place, which is listed under share on the menu. First, they brought out bread in a paper bag. The bread of the evening was a parmesan rosemary (not 100% sure) bread and a French baguette. The parmesan bread was excellent. It gave us a great idea of what the menu was going to be like. Next, we got an eggplant flan, which is something I would've never thought of. It was superb! Inside the flan were the flavors of eggplant, as well as spices to give it a slight kick (emphasis on slight), and topped with a red pepper sauce. Next was an arugala goat cheese flatbread. Again, outstanding! There was a layer lemon juice on the flatbread and then topped with arugala and goat cheese. Absolutely superb. Next was our entree, the ohio sirloin with a mushroom sauce and accompanied by potatoes au gratin. The meat was so tender, it melted in your mouth. The mushroom sauce and the cheesy potatoes were the perfect compliment.  After all of that food came a chocolate creme brulee for dessert. All I can say was it was heavenly. Overall, for a great dining experience meant to be shared with others, head to Ohio City and check out Light Bistro."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from a family member who happened to be a Cleveland chef as well.  I was very excited to give this place a try.  We walked in the door to no one.  Finally the host came over and sat us.  We walked through an empty restaurant to a half empty patio.  While sitting outside getting the smoke blown in our faces from the 5 drunk girls sitting next to us, we tried some of the food.  The meatballs we re actually a delightful surprise, everything else however was not.  The food was average, but definitely not worth the money.  We will not be returning, and despite the good reviews on yelp it seems a lot of Cleveland feels the same since people are never in the place.  Something needs to change quickly here!"}
{"text":"So sad to hear that they've closed their doors. We really liked this place.
Good luck guys!"}
{"text":"Just a little disappointed. We tried Light Bistro's happy hour because of some good Yelp reviews and all walked away a little miffed. The place looked fancy. The service was courteous and endearing. However, the food was very disappointing- not bad... Just disappointing. We had a chicken and pepper pizza and mac and cheese with chorizo and neither of which I thought were even worth a second bite. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe skip the happy hour. But ultimately we judged a book by its cover and felt a little cheated."}
{"text":"This place is tops, a true Cleveland treasure!

 Though now called \"Light\" (it's just recently changed hands; the former owner is now working with the West Side Market), the new management has given just as much thought to sustainable and local produce and meats, with delicious results! They know what they're doing, down to decent organic beer and wine.

All the waitstaff are friendly, talkative, and knowledgeable about the food they serve. Romantic enough for a nice date but also a great place to stop for a post-work bit of libation. The menu changes seasonally (as menus should!), but I'd highly recommend the pheasant with sage, pancetta, and sweet potato gnocchi. Portions are the right size (there's also a tasting menu), food presentation is dead-on, and...oh, fine I'll just say it, STOP HERE!"}
{"text":"We had my boyfriend and brothers birthday dinner here with 25 people. Light Bistro did a fantastic job! They were very accommodating and really friendly. Before the dinner I spoke with Lance the manager and he was so kind and thorough in explaining the menu and seating options for us. He really went out of his way to make us feel special even though it was just for a dinner. I appreciate that kind of personal and welcoming touch. Everyone that came to the dinner all seemed to enjoy their meals and spirits. I personally tried a little bit of everything. The crab fritters were money. Definitely would order then again if I went back. The scallops were delicious like everyone had said, so you really can't go wrong with them. I ordered some New England clam chowder and it was so good I could've licked the plate clean. Maybe I did. I can't remember, too many Moscow mules . I tried some of the fried chicken and mashed and it was awesome. The breaking on the chicken is dangerously delicious, I wouldn't be surprised to find out it has special powers. Seriously good. Clams were very tasty. The pizzas I tried were the only items I wasn't impressed with. Don't get me wrong they weren't bad, they just left me thinking meh, I've had better. My opinion, just focus on the tapas and entrees, skip the pizzas.
Our group was put in the back of the restaurant and it was a very cozy and intimate space. It had a nice fireplace and was away from the rest of the restaurant which was very nice. Overall, I had a great experience here and would definitely recommend this place for dinner or for a dinner party. The room we were in held up to 35 I think he said and the upstairs room held 60 and has it's own bathrooms for guests which is a bonus. Staff here is super friendly and quick! I was impressed with how efficient the kitchen was with our food and 25 guests!"}
{"text":"We try to make Light Bistro a \"go to\" every time we visit Cleveland. We love Historic Ohio City and LB is a contributing business that makes the area rich in atmosphere and restaurant experiences. The exposed brick walls, lighting and mullioned front windows, create an inviting and romantic atmosphere. With tapas, pizza and more substantial main courses, the menu has something that should appeal to all. With the food-rich West Side Market in close proximity, we would expect a much more interesting bread to be served. The baguette was dry and tasteless. Great to stop in for a drink as well.  Really like the restaurant and location.  By name alone, we would never have gone.  Sounds like a generic chain."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, fun choices and a great variety to choose from. Server was bery pleasant and took very good care of us! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just learned of the closing....I only stopped by about twice a year but the ford was fantastic.
What a loss......very fine food!"}

{"text":"Went to Light last night. This was our fourth visit, however we haven't been in over a year. Let's start with a great new enhancement. You can now choose a bottle of wine from their store and pay a $15 corkage which was really nice. This is a great feature if you are into wine like we are. 

On to the food....delicious.  We started with the lamb meatballs and fried clams and olives.  Both were yummy. We especially liked the fried olives with the clams. And the meatballs were flavorful and moist. My salmon panini was perfectly rare as I ordered it.  My husband enjoyed his grouper too. Everyone in our party seemed to enjoy their options.  One diner loved the beets. I don't eat beets, but he really liked them. Our cookies were a little dry, but warm and gooey. 

My two complaints were our server and the room we were in. The server was a bit rude and not attentive. She got a little better toward the end. I would hope to not be in her section again. Regarding the room, we were in the back room which is not our favorite due to the noise level. I think it is pretty and bright, but it is super loud...and no, I'm not old. We prefer the front room. 

All in all, we'll be back. The food is too good to not go back. And the prices are so reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is non-GMO, which is the reason my wife will come here with me. 

The food is outstanding! The carbonara pizza is thin crispy crust and decadent. 

Caramelized scallops are to die for! The preparation I had was with smoked trout, spinach and a corn velouté. It was tied for the best scallop dish I have ever had with a corn bacon scallop I had at Lola once. Really incredible dish. 

Blue corn crab fritters in Vietnamese dipping sauce were light and not greasy.  The sauce was a perfect compliment. 

The service was exceptional as well, from the hostess to our server and the bussers everyone was fantastic. 

Based on this meal I will be a new regular here."}
{"text":"My friend Devious noted that her favorite type of \"fancy food\" is \"normal food done really, really well.\" She found Light Bistro's pub menu to have some of those items (like the pulled pork sandwich and bruschetta) but thinks they got caught up trying to be overly fancy with things like mini lamb burgers. Personally, I like a little adventure and risk; sometimes the risks pay off, and other times they are just scary (i.e. the crawfish sandwich...I am horrified by crawfish of any sort, probably because we were forced to dissect, label, and scotch tape the pieces to poster board in the ninth grade. Crawfish should not be placed between two pieces of bread, no matter how French you make it sound.) Definitely check out their house cured olives and bacon wrapped cheese stuffed dates, both under $10. The pub menu, discounted during happy hour, features bruschetta and flat bread pizza that are well worth the $5. It is the only place in town that I know of where you can stop by the patio, share a bottle of wine, and a couple of plates of tapas while only spending around $10 each."}
{"text":"Best in town. Hands down. Haven't been since they changed it- but heard the atmosphere and food are just as sublime as before. We are a lucky city to have this little gem. The menu is seasonal, with locally produced and organic items. Simply delicious. Just do the five course tasting menu to get a feel of what everyone's been raving about."}
{"text":"Terrific!
Great: Foie Gras, Quail Breast, Chop Salad, Mojito
Ok: Flatbread, Blue crab and shrimp cake
Questionable: Table bread - sliced baguettes with tasteless (plain unsalted?) butter

Server was attentive and prompt, but we were one of only a couple tables having dinner on a Thursday night at 7:00pm.
Great Decor.  
The menu is very innovative and most everything looks delectable.
Try it!"}
{"text":"I enjoy their happy hour. 

The food is $5 and the beer is $1.50. But its a nice enough place that you can take a date without being embarrassed."}
{"text":"Five of us went to Light Bistro on a Thursday evening- the restaurant was full enough to know that it still commands a following after being open for several years.  

The service here was okay- our server started out great but then disappeared for too long.  Enough so that we didn't have time for dessert even though we gave him our timeline to start off with.  That was a bummer.

The food was spot on.  It is rare that five people leave a restaurant with smiles on their faces talking about how good the food was.  Chef Matt is technically proficient and shows good balance and restraint in his cooking.

The rock shrimp with white bean puree is great, but I think that the standout on the menu that we tried is the braised pork belly with cabbage, apples and mustard.  Really terrific dish.  Both pizza's at the table were crunchy and delicious- particularly the potato pie.  

The entrees were tasty, but for the price I would stick to the tapas.  There are so many to choose from that you can share with the entire table.  We will definitely stop back at Light Bistro to eat our way around the menu."}
{"text":"So I've been kind of putting off writing my first review, because I don't feel like I'm much of an expert in the realm of the \"foodie scene\" and whatnot...  But I'll tell ya what. If there's one thing I'm an expert on, it's fried things. And the fried green tomato BLT was spot on when I came here for a quick lunch yesterday. I mean, I had dental work done not too long ago that makes it kind of hard for me to open my mouth all the way right now, but I was pretty much willing to unhinge my jaw to eat that sandwich, python-style. Both the people I was with said that their meals - a basic burger and a salad with salmon - were above average as well. 

It was a late lunch on a Tuesday, so there wasn't much of a crowd. The service was super fast, and everyone working there was notably pleasant and friendly, which kicks it up to five stars in my book. 

POP! (That was my review cherry.)"}
{"text":"I went to Light Bistro for lunch with a few collegues. I am such a fan! We were one of the two parties in the restaurant for lunch, which I found surprising, seeing as the food was AMAZING and the decor/ atmosphere was really cool. It definitely had a contemporary laid back feel - corrugated metal siding and abstract art on the walls, good music, well lit...

I had the blackened tilapia wrap ($9) and we all shared the flatbread appetizer which was made with arugula and goat cheese. My friends ordered the caesar salad with grilled shrimp and some sort of olive burger. Everything was delicious and the presentation was very appetizing. 

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because the service was a little on the slow/disorganized side. I think it was the waiter's first day, and he seemed a little ill at ease, and the manager kept butting in to let him know that he could ask him questions. Not really inappropriate, but a little awkward. That aside, I will definitely go back AND recommend it to friends - the food was delicious (more than made up for the awkward service), and contrary to the other commenters, I dont think it was overpriced.

Also, the drink menu looked excellent, and I would love to go back and try them for happy hour or dinner. Good work Light Bistro!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came in last week for a romantic evening out. We had never been and decided to give it a try after hearing such great things. Our service was very courteous and prompt, as well as knowledgeable. We shared the mussels and croquettes to start, both were well done and very tasty. I then had the house salad with roasted broccoli and feta. Again, very well done and delicious. For my entree, I had the gnocchi w/ kale and walnuts which was AMAZING, perfectly cooked, light yet flavorful. I could it eat every day! My partner had the ribeye which was very pricey at $29 but was absolutely the best steak I have ever had. It is hard to pull off a steak that expensive and if not done right, can be a disaster. They sure pull it off. For dessert, we shared the chocolate molten lava cake, which was fantastic. Nice crafted cocktails and superb wine list.

Overall, it is quite pricey but definitely worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Beautiful ingredients, just enough variety / complexity to keep it interesting, great service and a warm ambiance.  Easily my most favorite restaurant in Cleveland now!  Will be back for more :)"}
{"text":"I have been to Light Bistro Twice. 

The first time was because my parents wanted to take me out for a birthday lunch.  We went in and were the only people in the place.  I am very familiar with the inside though because my dog and I walk by it at least twice a day everyday for two years. We ordered lunch. I got a Burger with blue cheese and bacon on it.  It cam with Parmesan cheese fries.  My husband got the salmon dish.  

I guess this place is more Tapas because the portions are so small. My husband was very mad and said he would never go back (it was like 14 for a 3 inch by 3 inch piece of fish on about 1/2 of rice.  I didn't think the food matched the price.  

The patio was very nice.  The service was very nice.  However it was very pricey.  I didn't want to spend too much on food, and the waiter was kinda of pushy about ordering dessert and i finally had to say a stern no.  

The Second time I was there we were in for Happy Hour. Completely different experience.  Cheap Appetizers.  They have a 5 for 5 deal (that is 5 beers for 5 dollars- Laugh at that DC).  They have lots of little finger foods to pick from.  I didn't think the pesto pizza was very good, but it was bar food so how cares.  Lots of people and intimate environment. GREAT HAPPY HOUR. 

I don't think I will be going back for dinner.  It is very expensive and based on my portion size, it think its one of those pompous little portions, big flavor places and good quality.  Me... I like quantity AND quality."}
{"text":"Food was good but a bit over priced. The server was grumpy and rolled his eyes when asked if there were any specials/entrees not on the menu! The gentleman that greeted me at the door was very nice and I wish he could have been our server. Overall probably will not go back. There is something to be said about the combo of food and service, if both are not on the same level then I will spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the most amazing homemade potato chips, head on down to Light Bistro. The are freshly made everyday with just the right touch of seasoning and a perfect crunch. 

Light Bistro also has a wonderful wine and beer list. I enjoyed the chips and a great lakes Christmas Ale, while catching up with old friends. The bartender was awesome. 

Avoid the Ohio City crowds and step into the Light Bistro."}
{"text":"Parker's is simply great food.  This place was using organic and locally grown and raised produce and livestock before such a concept came into vogue, putting it and Cleveland ahead of the curve.

Located in Ohio City, this place is one to try if you are stopping in for a visit or if you live here and have not yet tried one of the best restaurants the city has to offer."}
{"text":"5 star goes to the service here! We (a group of 4) came in on a Saturday night during the Winter Brite festival. Light Bistro was hosting some of the artists upstairs. It was very crowded, hardly could make it in the door and to the hostess so I figured she would say they are on some crazy long wait. But she said it would only be about thirty minutes. And then the bartender yelled our way asking us what drinks we wanted and he would bring them to us. Plus he said some people would be getting up from the bar soon so he would be sure and save the seats for us. And sure enough we were standing but with beers in no time and then two people got up and they saved those seats then did some rearranging so we had four bar seats to wait in. It was less than 30min and we got our table. Dinner was really great. We will be going back, I hear they have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"Not worth the trouble. Food was mediocre and pricey for what it was. Menu seemed limited. Scallops were good but portion was tapas-sized at $28. (I don't understand restaurants who skimp on the side portions.) \"Cleveland Fried Chicken,\" though talked up by the server, had leaden, underseasoned coating. The onion mash side was good, though very small serving, the green beans were tossed with about equal parts bacon, which was cooked only to the point of being rubbery. The Kobe burger was indistinguishable from ordinary ground beef, and the \"pommes frites\" it came were underseasoned, pale shoestring fries.  The marinara pizza with lamb meatballs was a generous portion, but nothing remarkable. We had to wait about 10 min for them to get our table ready when we arrived for our reservation. There is no real place to wait; you can sit at the bar if there's room or stand behind it. We checked our coats during that time but had to get them back when seated because it was so cold. (They had trouble finding them as they had used numbers more than once.) So noisy that we could barely hear server and he had to ask us to repeat orders. (There was a noisy group, but corrugated metal and brick walls really magnify the sound). The service was ok (water was topped frequently), but not very attentive; we were given one serving of bread and not offered another, despite more of a wait than one would expect given the number of diners. Server asked if we'd been there before but although we said no gave no real explanation of \"progressive american tapas.\" There seemed to be few if any specials, though server may have not bothered due to noise level. Several entrees recommended by Yelpers are no longer on the menu -- Hanger steak, kurabata pork loin, gnocchi. We didn't bother with dessert as we were cold, tired of the noise and disappointed with our mains. Won't return."}
{"text":"There was five of us on a Friday night and we had a reservation for 7pm. We started with a couple of beers and ordered some tapas and a couple of paninis.

I had high expectation for this place considering my other fellow Yelpers liked this place. It wasn't a really busy night but we still had to wait for a half hour for our food. The food wasn't really much to write about, it's mediocre. I can find something similar somewhere else. I ordered their bacon dates which tasted great however their other tapa selections wasn't so great. Maybe I didn't order the right stuff but then again, all of their foods should be good, right? The only nice thing about their dessert is that it came with beignets with coffee flavored ice cream. This was definitely a must to get at the end. A sweet finish to a mediocre dinner. I left the place hungry. I don't think I'll come again. 

The service was good in the beginning but our waiter disappeared after we ordered our food. We sure had plenty of water to drink though."}
{"text":"I returned to Light Bistro for lunch with a co-worker.  Great experience, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.   I ordered the BLT with a side of Pomme Frites.  The BLT was outstanding....toasted whole grain bread, topped with Bacon, Lettuce and fried green tomatoes.  The frites, were thin cut, crispy, and well-seasoned.  Another great meal at Light!   My co-worker and I wandered to the wine room and our server was very accomodating, by showing us around and telling us about upcoming events.  This is a great little place.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a disappointing evening.  Have you ever had that feeling when you meet the host/hostess and they just don't seem to impress you from the start?  This doesn't happen to me very often, but it unfortunately happened at Light Bistro.  

We sat outside and the restaurant inside and outside on a beautiful Friday evening was about half 1/4- half full.  Not sure if this is due to the location (a little off the beaten path) or the quality of their food.

We were here on my husbands birthday with an out of town guest and had pretty high expectations due to the good yelp reviews.  We ordered several appetizers.  The only memorable one was the spicy garbanzo beans: aka worst thing I have ever tried.  I don't complain much, but these were absolutely awful.  They were so hard and tasteless.  Not sure if it was just an off night for the beans or if this is how they normally are, but if they are normally like this, they need to be taken off the menu.  One could break a tooth because they are so hard!  The waiter was very nice though and promptly took them off our table.  

I had a gnocchi entree and my husband and his friend shared a couple pizzas.  The gnocchi was ok, a bit oily but decent and their pizzas were tremendously average. 

We were all very disappointed and do not plan on returning to Light Bistro.  It's such a bummer to have a bad experience on a birthday, especially with a friend visiting from out of town.  Next time we will go to Crop Bistro for great food in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour!

I just love the interior of this place. I'm a sucker for exposed brick...can't get enough of it ;)

Light's happy hour runs from 5-7p and includes great prices on beer, wine and food. I had some really decent $3 glasses of wine. I also had (off the regular menu) the Crispy Clams and the Classic Burger. The clams were really good with garlic aioli and fried olives. The olives were a cool unique addition. The burger was cooked perfect and included bacon and fried egg....mmm, heart attack. Seriously though, great burger and nice light bun. I'm not a fan of shoestring fries though.

Service was friendly and swift.

The regular menu can get a bit pricey, but there's enough economical options as well. You can't beat the happy hour prices either!"}
{"text":"I have been to Light Bistro on two occasions.  The previous time I was there, I found the atmosphere quite nice, with decent service.  At that time, it was earlier in the evening and the place wasn't terribly busy.  However, last night was my second time there and I was looking forward to an equally pleasant experience, but instead experience a myriad of problems.   I made a reservation on OpenTable for 9:30 at when I arrived, no tables were available.  This wasn't that big of a deal since my party and I were also running a little late, but this should have been a sign that some other problems may be on the horizon.  After being seated and starting dinner, many of the menu items were no longer available.  I considered that this was a busy day for them, since it was the Saturday evening before Valentine's Day and they were running a special for couples.  However, problems continued.  After ordering drinks (wine), we were served very different quantities of wine.  Since I was there on a date, I didn't make a fuss.  However, when we ordered a single tapas (Shrimp in a white bean sauce), it was served rather cold. Not impressive by any means especially since my first choice was not available.  Then, when ordering my main course, the vegetables that usually came with the dish weren't available and I asked the dish (a bison with veggies dish) to be cooked medium.  It was cooked more on the rare side.  Overall, I was quite disappointed in this multiple errors and lack of preparedness of their staff for a busy evening.  If I were to give a overall grade in service, it was be a C-.  I was hoping that the waiter would notice the problems and offer some sort of discount on the bill, but he was pretty oblivious as well, more concentrating on prepping tables for the next day instead about our quality of meal and service.  I was, unfortunately, quite disappointed with the restaurant (thankfully my company was really nice).  I would suggest caution going to this establishment towards the end of a busy evening."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Ohio City.  When the area's food takes a backseat to booze and W. 25th turns into wreck of bar-hopping madness, Light Bistro keeps the food in focus and delivers some of the best dining in Cleveland.  The food is expert level across the board, the ambiance is perfect, and the bar serves up great cocktails and beers.

I've been to Light Bistro for dinner and happy hour plenty of times.  It's always great. My last late-night meal experience was no different.  We popped in for some drinks and a late dinner.  I completely forgot that it's restaurant week and we were greeted with a pre fixe menu that I couldn't pass up.  I decided to order the Braised Pork Belly
(with Ramen Salad, House made Kimchi),  Herb Roasted Hanger Steak (with Potato Cake, Bacon and Mushroom Marmalade), and the Pear and Apple Crisp for desert.

None of these dishes are unique to Cleveland and I've been harsh on restaurants that play follow the leader by serving up the same old steak cuts and pork belly appetizers.  I'm not going to be hard in this case since restaurant week menus are more about offering an inexpensive, full dining experience that showcases the general style of the restaurant versus putting its best dish out on display.  With that said, I know Light Bistro can stretch well beyond the offerings and I wish they had.  The entrees on the normal menu are generally great--it changes regularly but I've never found it to be a copy-cat act.  I would actually argue there are a few Cleveland joints copying Light Bistro.

At any rate, the pork belly was perfectly cooked, the kimchi was flavorful, and the noodles had a fresh ramen texture.  The hanger steak was a hanger steak, but it was cooked beautifully mid rare (as ordered).  I was happy with the flavor and the sweet potato cake worked wonderfully with the mushroom marmalade.  The desert was also quite good.  It came out piping hot--fresh from the oven.  After it cooled, I tasted a great homestyle crisp.  This desert differed from the rest of the Light Bistro style of cooking since most of the items are not \"homestyle.\"  But it was a nice way to round out the meal.  

Service was great as usual and everyone had a fantastic time.  I'll continue going to Light Bistro often."}
{"text":"Light your palate!

As I approached Light from the sidewalk of Bridge I was very concerned. It did not seem like the posh locale everyone had said it was but it was too late as I was going on a first date (I thought it was too fancy but this guy wanted to show off his bucks so whatever).  As I was taken to our table I was still concerned. . . exposed brick with mirrors not much Light at all. We were seated and I began to feel more at ease. The wine list was good (not great good though). As it is a rather small space you are almost always seated very close to other patrons, my date did not seem to care and started telling stories about his first roommate in college's sexual escapades which was totally mortifying but thankfully the group sitting next to us spoke only francais so I doubt they comprehended much of what he spoke of. If you desire to converse about sexual escapades of any kind you may want to go to Lola you'll have more room between you and the next group of patrons. 
But I digress our server was phenomenal he was knowledgeable of the menu, wine, and of the ingredients most certainly a plus when presented with a food snob such as myself. We ordered 3 first course size plates and an entree to split.  I was excited upon looking at the menu as there were some more adventurous choices on the menu than at the Flying Fig which tends to be my gold standard. We started with a tuna tartare wrapped in cucumber with a tangerine sauce. It was divine. The tuna was smooth as butter and there were sunflower seeds in it to give added texture and the sauce and cucumber wrap was just enough to balance the inherent spiciness of the tuna. My date at this point showed his true colors as he said \"thats raw I won't eat it \"and sent his half back without even trying it faux pas 2 I believe. Next came a quail stuffed with fresh apples  with a squash puree. yum yum yum yum yum. Traditional and not too exiting but amazing regardless. Faux pas 3 for Mr Rico Suavee was his unwillingness to try anything but the protein. He had insisted that for the 3rd first course size portion we get the Kobe beef. There were much better things on the menu but its kobe beef its automatically amazing. Now this was a dish served with a twist the beef was served raw with a cooking stone. You cook it yourself as much or as little as you want. It was served with sweet sushi rice and a wasabi soy sauce very yummy. Faux pas 4 for RIco, he tried to cut into the cooking stone as if it were food. . . big shiny black food. All the while the server came between every course asked if we needed anything cleared plates and silver and gave more water. 
Now for the meat and potatoes of the meal so to speak. . . the entree. Ostrich with rhubarb risotto. The flavors mixed in the perfect combination of savory sweet and sour. All at once my palate felt more invigorated than ever before. The fireworks going on in my mouth nearly made me forget about the dexter with a boner I was dining with. 
The sorbet after dinner was nothing special. Homemade yes but nothing you can't get at any place that makes their own. Mine maybe not as it was passion fruit but the techniques used were the same as your standard sorbet.
It wasn't too pricey especially as you walked out very satisfied about 100 for all the food and a bottle of wine. Now for my faux pas for the evening. Rico suave pays the bill and I see he gave a 10% tip. I took the folder from him and threw in an additional 20 because service like that deserves a good tip. Needless to say that was the first and last date for Rico Suave and I.

Don't miss
The local ingredients in every dish. Who ever knew ohio could make food that could be made into such a sexy dish

Hit or miss.
Seating you could end up listening more to the next tables conversation.

Avoid like the plague
Going there on a bad first date."}
{"text":"I accidentaly stumbled, very hungry, and by myself into this trendy, brand new restaurant. 

I was the first customer of the evening, and they were litterally standing around waiting for customers when I arrived.

The prices were higher than I was expecting, but the food was AMAZING.

The owner chatted with me for quite some time, and by the end of the meal knew my name and my hobbies. 

The taste of the food was amazing. I ordered a caprese salad, thinking I was going to get the usual tomoto-basil-fresh mozzerella which I know and love. 
I revcieved this amazing mozzerella-honeydew-cantelope-honey-rosemary creation which had a stunning fresh taste to it. 
The tuna tar-tar which I had next I could give or take, mostly because I was still in awe of the beginning dish.

Go to this restaurant on a date. A date that wants to spend money, its a pricey place, but the unique flavors are a definate plus."}
{"text":"Class. That's the word I'd use to describe Light Bistro. From the moment we walked in and the bartender greeted us with a genuine smile and a \"Be right with you guys.\" we knew this was going to be good. The atmosphere, reminiscent of the converted rowhouse restaurants we used to frequent while living in Baltimore, is a combination of history and jazz. Exposed brick oozes stories of old Cleveland and a vibe that's both understated and elegant in equal portions. 

The front bar plays host to the after work crowd, an older more sophisticated grouping than you might find at some of the Tremont spots and the back dining area a perfect nook for knoodling. It was earlyish on a Tuesday evening and happy hour was winding down. A two-top by the big window was perfect.

Our server was a perfect match to the restaurant. He was friendly and attentive in a way that's most often reserved for the more posh eateries of the area and his attention to detail didn't go unnoticed come tip time. Waters were constantly filled, empty plates removed with expedient efficiency and clean silverware turned with every course. Like I said, you don't get this level of service often so you tend to notice it when you do.

So what was the occasion? I just happened to be saying goodbye to my 30s in a Jazz funeral kind of way. Fitting, wouldn't you say? Our bellies were empty and we were feeling adventurous. The menu at Light would offer up just what the doctor ordered. The menu is ecclectic without straying into weird. There are pizzas, burgers and paninis should you feel like getting your fingers a bit buttered and plenty of variety in the larger plates if you're there to make a night of it. We skipped around the menu like a well-worn mix tape:

The Starters:
Crispy Fingerling Potatoes - I love potatoes and these were perfect. Golden fingerlings baked and flash fried arranged around a centerpiece of ridiculously smooth garlic aioli. Crispy with flecks of salt clinging to the skin. This dish was simplicity done right.

Crispy Clams - If you've sworn off fried clams as rubbery and tasteless you owe it to yourself to give these a try. Golden fried strips of the mollusk interspersed with lightly breaded and dried olive rings and a schmear of garlic aioli (see above). The clams were tender with just the right amount of chew and the saltiness of the olives added the seasoning.

Apple Salad - Symmetrical leaves of fresh green Bibb lettuce arranged bowl-like around a \"slaw\" of finely julienned granny smith apple dressed in herb vinaigrette. The apple was the star here and the hint of cilantro was a welcome distraction. The roasting of the walnuts and the fresh Monchengo cheese turned the dressing into a creamy concoction I'd eat on any salad. I devoured the entire thing.

The Mains:
The Classic Burger - He who paired breakfast and a burger was a brilliant (and probably large) man. A soft brioche bun, a perfectly seasoned and cooked to order two-finger thick patty of juicy sirloin and the crispy bacon and oozy yolked egg. American cheese to keep things grounded. This burger is a contender. The fennel and red onion slaw added a nice acidity and was the perfect interbite palate cleanser.

Roast Kurabuta Pork Loin - The only misstep of the meal, the sliced pork loin was slightly dry, cooked just past medium. Still tasty, the spoonpushed horseradish mustard helped make up for the lack of moisture with a pleasant bite and the bits of crispy ham added a great textural element. A bit of of the red cabbage slaw with each bite made this one an upscale German comfort.

Our experience at Light Bistro was top notch. In general, the food was expertly prepared with ingredients that school your tastebuds in the art of fresh and the service didn't skip a beat. This is the kind of place that makes me happy to be an adult, a place where I don't feel like I'm the parent chaperone at a school dance. The kids can have their hipster dives. I'll take this place."}
{"text":"Light Bistro is a must-go if you appreciate innovative combination of items that result in some of the superb dishes. The resturant is tucked away at a street corner in Ohio City and carries a quiet romantic ambiance especially earlier in the evening. Their wine menu is also impressive for a restaurant this size. I was very pleasantly surprised at every aspect of this place on my first visit. The service was very polished and our server Joe, was an excellent host talking us through almost all items in detail. This was great help in letting us pick some very tasty dishes."}
{"text":"Review in a gist: Nicely done, but needs some improvement.

The atmosphere is great, very laid back but still chic. Seating is kind of odd to me, but I'm used to the table-packed bistros of Seattle, but it definitely works. 

I don't know if this applies to the men's bathroom, but the women's bathroom is TINY. Seriously, if someone is washing their hands, you could take them out with a single push on the door (which, hey, way to make it look like an accident!). Though, my little green-friendly heart LOVES that they use hand towels and not paper towels. And that they source foods locally. Rock on.

The waiter was a true delight. How he managed to entertain me as well as provide the service he did was just great. He was even polite enough to laugh at my dorky jokes, which I really appreciate.

To the noms!

I had the bacon-wrapped dates, the mixed greens salad, and the ribeye with goat cheese farro. My friend had the chicken croquettes, the butternut squash bisque, and a panini (the panini I didn't taste because she is not a good sharer). For dessert, I got the \"coffee and doughnuts\" and she got the chocolate cake (basically, molten lava cake?). 

The bacon-wrapped dates were sublime, as expected. The sweetness of the dates, the tang of the cheese, the crunch of the almonds, and the saltiness of the bacon. Hell-freaking-yeah! 

The chicken croquettes were good, but not spectacular (the red pepper sauce was divine though), and the butternut squash bisque was delicious but lacked something, couldn't put my finger on it.

Oddly enough, what really shined that evening was the mixed greens salad. The perfect combination of sweet, spicy, and tangy. The spiced pecans REALLY made the salad and the lucky penny feta was superb. Julienne pears were a great touch. I think next time I go, I'm just going to order a double of this salad and the bacon wrapped dates.

The Ribeye was solid. I love my steaks \"black and blue\" (crispy on the outside, cold in the middle). They really tried, it's a hard preference to pull off successfully (even more so when you have a party of 16+), but it wasn't quite right. Regardless, the steak was delicious and well-seasoned. The downfall of this was actually the succotash. WHERE WERE MY LIMA BEANS?! And why did the green beans taste frozen? Actually, why did ALL of it taste frozen?! YUCK! Had they left this off, I would have been far happier with just the root vegetables (which thankfully did not include carrots. I. Hate. Carrots.) It was thoroughly off-putting. 

The goat cheese farro was solid, but not spectacular. It needed something fresh and green. Dill would have been fantastic or a touch of fresh thyme. 

The desserts were a catastrophe. The \"coffee and doughnuts\" were supposed to be beignets with espresso ice cream. It would have been brilliant if the 'beignets' were actually beignets. They were these round globs of yeast dough that hadn't quite cooked through and were heavier than lead weights. Someone please please please fix this. It nearly broke my beignet-loving heart. The chocolate cake with whipped cream and strawberries....jesus. There is obviously no pastry chef back there. The cake was eggy to a level that I took one bite and was rather repulsed. I did not go back for a second bite. 

Overall, it was a great dinner until the end. If they can fix the succotash problem and hire a pastry chef (or get some solid recipes lined up), I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great background music, ample parking, great Cappucinos, good service, and delicious Ostrich!"}
{"text":"Had a good experience at Lite Bistro last night.  There were definitely some things they could do better that could have made it an excellent experience!

We were a little late getting there, and the hostess was great and politely took us to our seat.  The restaurant only had 2-3 other groups of people when we got there and never was too busy throughout the night.  Which was fine with us, it wasn't too loud and we were able to catch up with friends. While we were siting down...here is when the first weird thing happened.  She asked me if I wanted to know about that night's special cocktail.  I said \"sure.\"  She started telling me about this vodka ginger drink before everyone had even sat down and I don't think everyone could hear her.  I was just confused why the waitress just didn't tell us the drink when she came to the table and told us the dinner specials?

The waitress did come to the table and she was nice and efficient throughout dinner.  We had read this was a tapas restaurant, so we were ready to share dishes and drink some sangria!  The waitress asked if we had heard about the \"special drink.\"  We said we had, and Eric said forget the special drink, we need two pitchers of sangria...STAT!  Big problem here, NO SANGRIA!  Actually, we ended up being just fine, because the cocktails we all got were perfectly poured.  A couple of us got the Pomegranate Margarita which was great, the French 75 and the regular martini were all enjoyed also.

We got a bunch of the tapas plates.  All were good.  It is less than 24 hours later, and I can't really remember any that stood out.  All were pretty standard.

One of my friends wanted me to make sure to let you know that you may ask for a toothpick at the end of dinner.  The waitress may tell you they don't have any.  Guess what, there are \"about a thousand\" of them at the hostess table on the way out!  :)

If you are looking for a good place to catch up with friends without it being too crowded, or without feeling rushed...this is a great spot.  Good cocktails, good food, and decent service.  Don't know if we will ever go back, but glad we went last night."}
{"text":"Are we allowed three updates for one place? I guess we are. 

I just want to chant \"Hap-py Hour! Hap-py Hour!\" every time I walk up to Light Bistro. But, I think I might need to change that chant to \"Lamb Ka-bobs! Lamb Ka-bobs!\" Or, if you ask my boyfriend, he might say the Chicago dog is really where the chant needs to be...

Regardless, all of these items are $5 on the HH menu. 

No, I'm not kidding you. Add that to high-end beers, wines and martinis all ridiculously priced at $5 as well and you've got yourself a party. But, when your fabulous, handcrafted cocktails are even cheaper, at a $4 price-tag, your just asking yourself for the ultimate happy hour love. 

I'm sorry, but in my opinion, this is *the* destination for an upscale, fine-dinning, local-loving happy hour in Cleveland. You will not find a better deal. 

In fact, just from this awesome experience, I think I'm going to sit at the bar from now on--no matter what. Their 'tender teaches cocktail design all over the country and he's awesome. End of story."}
{"text":"Overall, I was pleased with Light Bistro.  Dinner started with a selection of tapas plates:  I thought the Bacon-wrapped Dates were far too charred on the outside--basically obliterating the taste of the bacon.  The combination of the dates, almonds, and cheese was good, though.  The Lamb Meatballs in Mint Tomato Sauce were excellent, something that I would definitely recommend.  The Mussels + Frites were not good--the mussels seemed slightly overcooked and the shoestring potatoes--more garnish than food--ended up being an oily mess in the middle of the plate.  I enjoyed the Bag of Fresh Potato Chips--simple, crispy, and not too oily.

For a main course I had the Pan Seared Grouper with Pulled Pork and Ravioli.  This dish seemed more like three random items stacked on top of each other rather than a single coherent dish.  On top, the pulled pork was a little dry and lacking in taste.  The grouper in the middle was pretty well prepared and probably would have been fine in a larger portion on its own.  The ricotta ravioli on the bottom was okay, but also seemed disconnected from the whole.  On the other hand, on another occasion at Light I had the Roast Pork Loin, which was tender and juicy--so much so that I was tempted to have it again on my second visit (and now regret not).

Dessert was five fresh chocolate chip cookies.  Served hot with the chocolate still melting throughout.  I went ahead and paired it with a glass of organic milk.

I really liked the service at Light Bistro.  The overall environment is a little more relaxed than a formal restaurant but the service seemed to retain a deliberate formality, particularly noticeable as the server is setting your plates and silverware (and even more so the bread plates, butter, and butter knives) on your table in a very deliberate manner.  The food could use some improving in some areas, but the restaurant seems like it would be a pretty decent place to gather with friends and enjoy some tapas and wine or drink.  The wine list (probably about the right size for a bistro) has a number of medium to medium-high priced selections."}
{"text":"I came here last night for a bachelorette party and at first, I was surprised we picked light bistro for dinner instead of all the other \"more known\" restaurants in ohio city. The second you enter the room, there is such a claasy, romantic atmosphere. The front of the room seems like a more casual, happy hour atmosphere and when you walk through the hallway (and the hallway is filled with wine cabinets where you can explore different wine from.. bubbly wine, organic wine, etc..), you enter the back room. The backroom then has about 4-5 tables and it transforms into a reallyyy classy atsmophere.

Our server was AWESOME. He was so nice, so funny, and everything was on spot. The foods came out right on time, they were very considerate with a huge group of us, he filled our water everytime it was empty and he doesn't forget to ask if there's anything he can do for us. We were served by 3-4 people.. 1 person who fills our water and ordered our wine, 2 people to make our orders and serve our dishes, and 1 person who came by about twice to ask how our evening was.

Now...onto the main event: THE FOOD.

These are all the TAPAs we had: fingerling potatoes, marinated mushrooms, corn on the cob, salad, and clams. 
Everyone LOVED their tapas. I believe every single one of us finished every bit of our tapas and didn't leave any leftovers. I had the fingerling potatoes with garlic aioli and it was SPLENDID. These are such good tapas. 1 thing though.. I don't think their tapas beat Bodega's (on coventry)

Then, the ENTREEs. I had the pork loin with bacon and banana peppers. The bachelorette sampled 3 people's dishes: my pork loin, a salmon main course, and a short ribs main course dish. According to the bachelorette, she thought the short ribs was the best.. because she liked the short ribs so much, she's planning to change her food order for her wedding! As for my pork loin, i loooooved it! The bacon pieces was crispy and delicious. The sweet potatoes were sweet and a perfect addition to the meal. And the pork loin was made to perfection. It was made MEDIUM and it was sooooo good. If I didn't have the tapas, I would've finished the pork loin with a heartbeat. My friend who had the salmon actually finished her entire meal too!

Overall, the service was great, the staff was great, and the food was AMAZING. I will definitely either be bringing my boyfriend here or at least making an appearance to their happy hour again!"}
{"text":"I was in town last week and went out to lunch at Light Bistro with a friend.  When we arrived, I am pretty sure it was the owner, greeted us and led us to our table.  He was very friendly.  After being seated for a bit the waitress took her time coming over to talk with us.  She wasn't very friendly or helpful.  We ordered wine which was very good and then ordered the tomatoe soup (tasted like marinara sauce, not good), corn chowder which was great, and shared the pork belly sandwich.  The sandwich was not good.  It was fatty and cold and just rather unappatizing.  The menu is quite limited for lunch as well.  The atmosphere was great but the staff and the food just didn't live up to expectations."}
{"text":"Three stars for the food...and two stars for their fantastic service!

I organized a birthday dinner for a large group (15+ people). Not only did they seat us all together in a private room, service was overall impeccable. Food was brought out all at the same time in a timely fashion, and they were more than willing to split up checks. I got the Kobe burger which was good but not mind blowing. Overall people seemed pretty happy with their own entrees, however. Drinks were good, too. I'd go back to try their other small plates."}
{"text":"Checked out Light Bistro on a Saturday night recently with a dining companion. We had a fantastic meal. We started with their fingerling potatoes with garlic aioli. It was amazing and extremely reasonably priced at $5.

My dining companion started with the ravioli and chicken confit. He said it was very god, although the serving was rather small for $12, For his main course he had the Ohio ribeye, which he said was fantastic but a bit pricey at $29. 

For my main course I had the onion tart, which was delicious and very reasonably priced at $10. 

The service was wonderful and the restaurant itself had very nice ambiance. My only real complaint is that on an almost 100-degree day there was virtually no air circulation in the restaurant. It was incredibly sticky and hot. While I know that it's an old building, a ceiling fan (or 2 or 3) may have helped a great deal and made the whole dining experience more enjoyable. Even some free standing fans in the dining room would have helped, especially since a man at the table next to us had not applied enough deodorant..."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but excellent presentation, wonderful selections and great service. I don't understand why they serve their bread in a paper bag. It's like the bread of the unknown comic."}
{"text":"I'm only reviewing the wine shop right now, but may go back for the food:

So. It's finals week. My last finals week. And I felt like a bottle of wine would help me study! I decided to walk down the street and try out the Light Bistro's little wine shop. 

Walking in I was kind of afraid I wouldn't be able to afford the wine...

By the way, the restaurant is very romantic, beautiful art on the walls, great soft lighting. The bartender was very friendly as well, he directed me to Pete, the wine guy.

I was given a \"tour\" of the wine, which was fun! The room is small, has maybe 6-8 sections of wines. I was informed that the Chef had personally chosen and tasted each wine, and that wines were sourced from small, independent growers. 

And, to my pleasant surprise, they had a great range of prices!! Definitely a lot of bottles under $10, but of course all the way up to more than I could imagine paying for a bottle of wine. 

I did ask about the menu, wondering aloud if there was anything vegan. Pete's eyes lit up and said, \"There might be one or two things. But, if you call a day or so in advance, Chef would be more than willing to make a special trip to the market and create something special!!\""}
{"text":"Light Bistro is an inspiring change of pace in a land full of gluttonous comfort food restaurants. Priding themselves on small plates, aka \"tapas\", this is a perfect place to try many dishes on the menu without breaking the bank. Great food should be celebrated, shared and enjoyed and the tapas form of dining helps facilitate that. 

A recent meal at Light Bistro included Butternut Squash Soup, tapas plates of Bacon wrapped Dates stuffed with Almonds and Valdeon Cheese, Lamb Meatballs with Mint Tomato Sauce and Braised Pork Belly with Grain Mustard, Braised Red Cabbage & Apples.

Our server was knowledgeable and treated us well. The food was plenty acceptable and I would like to return to try the rest of the menu someday. I will say that I wasn't exactly blown away by any one item I tried that night though. With that said, all dishes were moderately priced and the value seemed well worth it for a return visit."}
{"text":"A Light lunch? Maybe because I didn't want to eat it...

After reading previous reviews I wonder if my distaste for Light stems from the fact that I visited during the lunch hour. Everyone else seems to have had a wonderful experience and I can honestly say I won't ever be rushing back.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely; a long hardwood bar gives way to a cozy room with tables. The staff is just exceptional. They were incredibly friendly and very attentive; my glass was never empty. I really had high hopes for the food, as well.

As previously noted, the bread comes in a white paper bag (not the most \"green\" practice); today's selections were french baguette and Parmesan. I only sampled the french baguette and I can honestly say it was on par with what I would get at Panera. Not bad any account, just not overwhelmingly good. The breads were accompanied by organic fresh butter - apparently unsalted and very, very bland. I purchase fresh butter all the time at the West Side Market just blocks away - I wanted to give them the name of my vendor and tell them to ditch this stuff. 

For my entree I had the boxed lunch - butternut squash bisque, caesar salad and an apple and brie panini. The soup - which is usually a favorite of mine - was so flat. It had no sweetness, no spice, nothing. I was hoping for a note of nutmeg or curry - something. It tasted like pureed squash with cream and salt. Maybe some garlic. I left most of it behind. The caesar salad was good, but I defer to the fact that it takes talent to truly mess up a caesar salad. It was accompanied by tomato preserves; the only wonderful, memorable taste of the trio. The sandwich disappointed me the most as I was so looking forward to it. It was billed as brie, granny smith apple and celery on a french baguette. It tasted like uncooked celery stuffing. All I could taste was celery and bread. There was no tart bite from the apple, no creaminess from the brie. I actually had to force myself to eat half of the sandwich to not appear rude to my host, who was enthralled with the food at Light. 

Lunch did end on a good note: I was served a warm chocolate chip cookie as part of the boxed lunch. However, I could have gone to Max and Erma's for a hot chocolate chip cookie so it's not really all that impressive."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here! For $25 you can get a slice of prix fixe heaven. Started off with a salad of apples and manchego, then a main course of the Sweet Potato Ravioli, which was awesome. FInished with the panna cotta. Normally I love chocolate in my desserts but this panna cotta with fresh berries was delicious. Interlace the meal with some albarino and the result is a great meal."}
{"text":"Service was crap and food was poorly seasoned - not worth the price."}
{"text":"A great experience. The most hospitable and welcoming dining experience I've ever had. 

My cousin was in town from WA and had never been to Cleveland before so I took her out for a night on the town. After much yelping I decided on Light Bistro. Despite both of us being sadly under dressed both the gentleman at the door and our server Lance were incredibly gracious and welcoming and never made us feel awkward. 

We were there a bit early for dinner and had no trouble being seated right away. 

Our server Lance was pretty much the most pleasant and gracious host you could imagine. 

The food: everything was shared...

Bacon wrapped dates: they were pretty good but I liked the ones I had at Fahrenheit better.

Southern Fried Quail: Not that good. The meat was tender but sparse, the potato cake was nothing to write home about and the gravy was flavorless. Def. not worth the money.

Albondigas (Lamb Meatball) Pizza: AWESOME! Tasted great and was huge compared to the other dishes. We couldn't even finish the whole thing!

My only regret was not getting dessert. The beignets were VERY tempting but I held off because part of my plan was to go see some live music and I was planning to go to Fat Fish Blue later for beignets. Of course I eventually found out that FFB hasn't had beignets on their menu for years which is ridiculous and unacceptable for a New Orleans themed restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited twice, once for bar and once for restaurant while visiting Cleveland.   Unique food that meets the criteria of being \"foodie\".    Wonderful drinks too."}
{"text":"our dinner at light bistro was one of the best i've had in a while. i love the whole tapas style, because you get to try a bunch of things but still end up having a great dinner. we shared 2 pork tastings (to die for), lamb meatballs (a must try), and crispy clams (really tasty). the pork tasting had such a delicious sampling of bacon wrapped pork tenderloin, pork belly, and ribs served on top of cheddar risotto. soo soo good! the lamb meatballs are in a mint ragu sauce, and they are like the best thing ever. i never would have thought to put mint in spaghetti sauce. the sauce tasted so fresh and was excellent! for dessert we had the coffee and donuts, which was AMAZING. it was these homemade beignets rolled in cinnamon sugar with a chocolate ganache dipping sauce and coffee ice cream. we also had the chocolate lava cake which was so awesome. LOVED every bite! the service was phenomenal, and the patio is so nice. i can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A little too expensive for a just-out-of-college-er to make a habit of eating here regularly, I really enjoyed the one time that I ate here.  We sat out on the patio in perfect summer weather and felt very cultured and trendy (at least, I did) as I sipped on a mojito and ate my fancy pizza (see image provided by Amy T).  I think this place would be great for a group happy hour as we did, or perhaps for a hot, impressive date."}
{"text":"First off, our service was friendly and impeccable. The $5 eats and $5 or less drinks during happy hour is a great deal. We had the happy hour burger which was a cheeseburger with chili jam....heavenly. Crispy clams was pretty tasty especially for me since I don't usually like olives but they were a nice combo. The frites hit the spot but the best thing was the beignets.with chocolate ganache and coffee ice cream...omg. 

Finally, the intimate setting and location that's a little off from the hustle and bustle of west 25th is nice for date night, birthdays, and happy hours that is more relaxed. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a unique and very tasty meal, try the ostrich.  It tastes like a cross between beef and duck.  They perfectly sear the outside, and the inside is very juicy and tender.  The only thing I didn't like about the meal was the orzo, which tasted too gummy to me. The sauce and the green beans, however, were very good.

Service was excellent.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and went through the menu thoroughly."}
{"text":"For a very private and cozy evening I'd go here, food is tasty and \"cute\" kind of pricey but the atmosphere leaves you alone with your partner."}
{"text":"Dare I say, the best happy hour in Cleveland that I've been to !? I've only had one experience here at the Light Bistro, just 2 blocks from Great Lakes, 
(This review is based on one happy hour visit), but I was throughly impressed with the great value, service, and food and drink here. 

At a very slow night for Light Bistro [Valentine's day was only 2 days earlier and it was a very wintry weekday], my sister and I were looking for a new happy hour to try for her birthday. Sitting at the bar, we mentioned to the bartender [Neil] this was our first time, he politely and concisely explained the happy hour specials which are also listed on their very informative website.  

Throughout the night, he provided great service: filling up our water without asking, promptly filling our drink orders, etc, and gave us a background on the women's hockey for the winter games. Ron the manager was at the bar, very warm and chatty, discussed the wine choices [all I knew was we ordered a $10 bottle of Malbec from Argentina that seemed all right], and Polish food traditions with us. 

Smooth, contemporary jazz played softly in the background. 

The pork belly sandwich: crustless, fluffy rye bread with pork belly in between. Contrasted to Justin V.'s experience, it melted right in my mouth. The Lamb Burger: A steal at only $5. A large lamb and beef patty seasoned with some gyro seasoning with sliced cucumbers. I'm not a foodie but my sister and I thought it would have benefited more with some cheese (perhaps blue) on it. However, for only $5 [normally $12], I'm not complaining. 
The mint mojitos: excellent. Fresh mint was muddled right on the spot. The lime and mint flavors were fresh and strong. A great special at $5.
The flatbread, also $5, was great, with some pesto, cheese, olive oil on. 
The happy hour beer specials were limited to Heiniken, Amstel, ($7.50 for 5) and MGD, and Miller ($5 for 5), but you only see those prices at a dive. 

With a more sophisticated The happy hour offered excellent value. I would definitely meet a date for a happy hour or two. The regular menu is relatively expensive for me (avg. entree $20-25) but based on my experience, I would definitely try it if I had the money."}
{"text":"I'd heard nothing but fantastic things about Light Bistro so I trudged in with my boyfriend on a snowy winter night to try the place out, sort of on a whim.

First of all, it was a Wednesday, and there were barely any other customers. A lot of the Yelp reviews I'd read in advance of our visit said the place tended to be empty on random other nights, and I can't figure out why. Maybe it's busier on the weekend? Who knows.
 
Anyway, rather than going the sandwich or entree route, we decided to order a pizza and some of the tapas and split everything. We got the carbonara pizza (which \"seems perfect for a hangover,\" our waitress joked), the lamb balls, cheddar and ham croquettes, along with a side of spinach and a side of polenta. 
 
Everything was pretty good and we left with lots of leftovers. The pizza is pretty generous for two people and while the eggs weren't quite as runny as I would have liked, it was still very tasty. And yes, probably good for a hangover, if you were to wander into Light Bistro after a bender.
 
We were both wowed by the polenta, which was creamy, and sort of smoky, and had a delightful coffee-ish undertone. We were surprised to find out that there were no special ingredients in it -- just cream, butter, salt and polenta. Yum.
 
The spinach was good, but a little on the salty side for my tastes.
 
With all the food, a glass of wine and two beers, we left with a $55 bill, which was pretty reasonable. 
 
The burger came with high recommendations from a friend and his wife, so we'll be back, I'm sure."}
{"text":"Solid creative cuisine.  Don't go if you're just looking for a steak.  Dinner is much more a fine dining experience than lunch but both are solid."}
{"text":"Wow, I am amazed by this place.  I'm not sure where to start, so I'll start with the Happy Hour.

Most unreal happy hour around.  5 domestic beers for $5. Or 5 specialty beers (GLBC, etc) for $7.50!!  You cannot beat that!  They have an awesome selection of food as well for very reasonable prices.  The lamb burger is incredible, have it with a Dortmunder and you will not be disappointed.

Now the food is unreal as well.  I went to a Local Foods Wine Dinner that they put on, and it was absolutely unbelieveable.  The combinations of flavors and creations that Chef Matthew put out just blew me away.  I am a little upset that it took me so long to find this place, it's been open for almost two years now!!

I must say, you need try this place.  It may not look like much from the outside, but inside it is gorgeous and beautifully laid out.  A soft, friendly atmosphere keeps me wanting to stay there well after my meal is finished to enjoy their extensive wine list as well.

A must try in Ohio City, and one that not enough people know about."}
{"text":"Great place for an expensive snack. Would be more appropriately named \"Bistro Lite.\"

Don't miss the Beet Salad With Goat Cheese, Lamb Burger, Fresh Mozzarella and Melon small plate."}
{"text":"I arrived early-ish (for me) to meet my distinguished guest for a Lenten Friday lunch at Light Bistro.  Before I had reached my table, the manager took my coat and umbrella, gave me the nickle tour and answered any questions I might have about the place.  The waiter approached to take my drink order and continued the trend of solicitous service.  The service was fantastic throughout the meal, although the waiter had to be asked to bring the check-- he thought we wanted to gab more.  Which we did, but we also had jobs calling.

After asking a few questions about the menu, including which items might be Papally approved for lenten Fridays, I chose the boxed lunch.  After having my first two choices of sandwich nixed ( only panninis count, but nowhere does the menu distinguish paninis from other sammiches.)  I settled upon the brie and apple sammich, with the bread and tomato salad and a ceasar salad (the soup of the day had meat, so they subsituted another salad).  The bread and tomato salad was fantastically vibrant.  Amazing considering it was February.   The ceasar salad was inoffensive.  The brie sammich was a lactose coma inducing, crunchy slab of bliss-- it could have used many more apple slices, however, to offset the richness.

The standout was the bread they brought to the table in little bags.  It is warm, homemade, dense, rich and perfect.  It's served with some lovely organic whipped unsalted butter.  Joy.  Joy   Joy.  

And Papally acceptable."}
{"text":"The wife and I finally had a chance to eat at light a few weeks ago on an increasingly rare baby-free date night.

It was surprisingly uncrowded for a Friday night, which was very much to our advantage.  We were able to sit at a table outside in the cool fall weather and enjoy the beautiful evening.  

We ordered the meatballs and stuffed figs for starters, and both dishes were excellent.  I knew it had jalapenos on it, but they seemed much stronger than usual.  Perhaps, it was an interaction with the mustard on the sandwich?

I had the bison sandwich, which was delicious, though unexpectedly spicy.  The wife had the burger, which we both thought was amongst the best we've had.  The burger was cooked, yet moist, and the bun was very light and pleasing chewy with a consistency that reminded me of an English muffin.  Interesting, and very, very good. 

Our server for the evening was really very attentive, and we had a wonderful time, and we can't wait to stow the baby and come back again."}
{"text":"I decided to come here for lunch today because I had the day off from work and wanted to try something new. The bread and butter was good. My friend ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with pasta salad for $9, I ordered the chicken salad with fries for $9. The sandwiches were cut in half, so we shared. They both were very good. I preferred the grilled chicken sandwich and would recommend it. It had caramelized onions and pineapple. A very good taste combination. The service was outstanding. The server was a genuinely cool girl. She seemed to have a really nice personality for a change. I will return for a dinner meal soon."}
{"text":"This was my second time here; hadn't been in since winter. Got to sit on the patio this time. It's not a very scenic patio with views of the rear of Dave's Supermarket. It's also within ear shot of the St Ignatius HS football field and associated game noise (tonight lacrosse), but that adds to the neighborhood atmosphere actually. The food was great. My friend and I each got the hanger steak ($24). They were cooked perfectly. It was served on a delicious mushroom and bacon marmalade with Baby Bok Choy. I wish the portion had been a bit bigger; the flavors could not be savored long enough."}
{"text":"I went here for the Happy Hour because I was under the impression that there was lots of good eats. They really only had a few options on their happy hour menu. Most were vegetarian except for the fried clams. They were just OK. It simply tasted like breading. It did come with fried kalamata olives also, which was new to me and added a nice salty touch. The dipping sauce was bland and didnt add much to the dish besides a peace of mind that you were getting sauce. I also had the mojito which was nice and flavorful (you can really taste the sugar and mint!).

Overall, based on this experience and their happy hour options, it was just OK and did not meet expectations. The reviews raved about their happy hour, but looking back at them, they were dated several years ago... I presume that their menu has changed since then."}
{"text":"A top contender for best HH...at least in Ohio City.  

Light Bistro has $1.50 beers, $3 cocktails and $5 plates until 7pm.  The cocktails were either a Sex on the Beach or an Amaretto Sour.  Remember those?  The drinks that you first started drinking when you turned 21 and could actually order at a bar?  They both tasted like college to me...well...maybe better than college.  I'm pretty sure all my college drinks had a good dose of poor decisions in them which leave a strange aftertaste in your mouth...the next morning.  

Though we didn't order any food, the options were enticing.  Crayfish sloppy joes?  Lamb burgers?  It's a nice way to differentiate off of a typical Happy Hour menu.  

Our service was decent although it seems like every time we wanted to close out a check, he just wasn't around as much as when we wanted to order more drinks.  So it is life in the Happy Hour world though.  Everyone wants us to stay, not to leave.  I guess that means we're well liked? 

Overall, I was very, very pleased with their Happy Hour.  Great prices and it's not often that you can find a $3 cocktail.  I say - Check it out!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to recommend Light Bistro - the warm look, the friendly people.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive, except for forgetting to bring more coffee. 
     My friend and I split an appetizer and sandwich.  The pork belly sandwich was very good and I would order it again.  The goat cheese and lemon flatbread was boring and we didn't even bother to finish it.
     It was also freezing in there.  We had to ask the waiter to cover up the air conditioning vent because it couldn't be closed."}
{"text":"After seeing the great reviews for this place, I decided on coming here for a group dinner before going out for my birthday. I'm not sure if things have drastically declined since a lot of the reviews I read were written in 2010-2011 or if we just had an off experience, but none of us (party of 14) were impressed...

The downstairs is cute and quaint and I'm sure it would have been a different atmosphere if we had dined there. We were seated upstairs, which was nice since we had a big party, but was also awkward, b/c we felt like we were just placed in an attic - quiet, cold, just awkward. 

Food: Shared the fingerling potatoes and spinach and ricotta pizza with a few friends. Potatoes were dry and meh - garlic aoili was delish! The ricotta pizza was good, but legit was just dough, ricotta, and spinach - not much to it. I dipped it in the garlic aoili which made it tastier. Ordered the Risotto primavera as an entree. It was completely bland. The eggplant and the broccoli looked and tasted like they were old (broc looked like it may have been overdone but it actually tasted pretty nasty too). I asked for hot sauce, which wasn't brought to me until the end of the meal, so it didn't really help much. I did have extra garlic aoili on the table so I mixed some with the risotto, which kind of helped. Moral of the story? Ask for a side of garlic aoili to enhance flavor that's lacking. Everyone at the table pretty much had the same experience with their food that I did. Items that people really did enjoy included the margherita pizza and the apple and walnut salad. 

Drinks: the specialty drinks were pretty tasty- the margarita was good. I had a few vodka waters and they were made pretty strong which was good. 

Service: We didn't have the best service. The waiter was kind of awkward and seemed out of it. It probably didn't help that they gave him our entire table with no help, but service was slow, he kept forgetting to bring things over until we requested it twice or three times, and overall service was lacking.

Price: Judging from the quality of the food and service we received, we didn't really think the prices were worth it. If this was an off night and food and service are usually good, I could see why they charge what they do, but from what we received - not so much. 

I doubt I'll return to Light Bistro- I always like trying new places and it sucks that we had this experience for a birthday dinner- we all went out on empty stomachs after the restaurant -but hey - at least that made for a cheaper night out?? 

**PERK of this place is that they have free valet parking on Fridays and Saturdays!!"}
