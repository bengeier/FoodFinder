{"text":"Great Friendly neighborhood milk store.  The people working here are consistently happy, friendly and helpful. Glad they are in the area!"}
{"text":"A great little convenience store with more selection of useful stuff than a Macs, but less than a grocery store. The real draw is the genuinely friendly staff, and the $3 breakfast sandwich that has egg, cheese, bacon AND sausage on an English muffin. They also have my Kryptonite, mixed bags of gummy candies, by the till. Pretty much all you could ask for from a corner store!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and happy to greet you when you come through the door.  I have yet to try thier breakfast sammys but I live just down the road and I smell the deliciousness every morning. But they're night staff is fantastic ecspecially chris he funny and quirky and always able to talk and joke around with his customer's.  They treat you like part of the family. Honestly 5 stars isnt enough to rate this place and the people that work there. I'd give it a solid 8 stars just cause theyre conveniently close and always smiling theres no way to leave there without a smile on your face."}
{"text":"I love how this place closes late. Especially when there's not of places that open during night around here.Took me about 8 mins to walk from the Greyhound The food is scrumptious but a little bit heavy on the salt. Pricing is reasonable- when you're hungry"}
{"text":"For the 3+ years I've lived in Sunalta, I've started most of my days with nothing but sunshine from the OneWay Models at the One Way Deli.   Friendly service, great food, quirky humor, prices that won't break the bank. This is the perfect convenience store for this edgy, funky neighborhood.   Today I tried the One Way Melt. I had to write a review. What a sandwich.  Nice work Tyler and Carter. Thanks for everything. Everyday."}
{"text":"This store is a secrete gem at the end of 11th ave. They always have fresh food at amazing prices. The staff are sooo friendly and nice. I love going here."}
{"text":"\"Good morning! What can we get for you?\"  \"I'm here for a breakfast sandwich.\" Word on Yelp is that there are breakfast sandwiches here for $3. And they come with bacon AND sausage all warm and melty with an egg and cheese inside a bun.  \"We've got some of those!\"  It was made earlier that morning I presume and then kept nice and warm in a foil wrapper, just waiting for hungry morning person to devour it. And it was indeed $3. Taxes all in. Yep, just $3. It also can with sausage and bacon and egg and cheese. Don't be fooled. There was nothing gourmet about it. Just a good old fashioned breakfast sandwich. You likely could make it at home yourself as well... but then, well, you'd have to make it yourself.  I wish I had known about the almighty breakfast sandwich back in the days when I was still walking distance from One Way Foods. I would've back tracked a block or two to grab me some breaky before starting the trek into work.  Drawback for morning commuters, One Way Foods is on 11th Ave... a \"one way\" headed the opposite direction from where you're coming in off Crowchild. Although, they make plenty of items you could pick up for dinner on your way home."}
{"text":"awesome friendly service from Tyler Carter and Randy every day, coffee is better than most places and cheaper, I went once cause it was near now I would do the detour every day to see them. they also have amazing breakfast sandwich and lunch on week days. I don't know about week ends as I usually stop on my way to work"}
{"text":"\"Good morning, Brother! You need some brekkie today?\"  Yup, that's pretty much the same thing I hear every time I make the trip up the street on the way to work. This place is powered by heart, soul and trace amounts of -redacted. I stand corrected by the owner. If anything it would be alcohol, but let's just say SOUL- and it's marvellous.    Tyler, one of the owners, whips up $3 breakfast sandwiches every morning - and you won't have to choose between bacon, egg and sausage - they come with all three.  And that's just how things are done here - friendly, full and laaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiiid back. They'll learn your name. They'll make fun of your accent. They'll feed your stomach and fill your soul.  If you're in the area and you're in need of a little human connection, give this family of wonderful folks a try."}
{"text":"This is perhaps the friendliest convenience store EVER.  They know their customers and have pretty much anything you could need - convenient right?  Need a breakfast sandwich in the morning? They make 'em with both sausage AND bacon. No need to choose which breakfast meat you love more, why not have both?  Need a homemade lunch? They have 'em.  Whether homemade soup, pasta salads, their feature of the day, or just some hot dogs, One Way has something for you.  Need to mail a bunch of firewood to Kalamazoo?  Fantastic!  They sell firewood AND stamps.  I'm also pretty sure they will help you figure out where Kalamazoo is too!  (Phew!)  On certain things the prices are a little higher.  You want convenience, there's a cost.  But for other items - my daily coke zero addiction that I will be discontinuing soon...hehehe - they are cheaper than Co-op or Mac's.  If you live or work nearby, pop in and support this fantastic local business.  These guys get customer service and many other businesses could learn a lot from them.  Plus, they also know my name - woot!  (1/30)"}
{"text":"Oddly delicious food-odd because the location is in a small corner store that doesn't look that reputable.  But then you smell what they are cooking and your nose will tell you-no try this deliciousness...really try it.  And then you do and you are happy... I still have yet to get the elusive chilli burger as they are always sold out!"}
