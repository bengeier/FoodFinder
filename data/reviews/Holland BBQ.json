{"text":"Been there once. Wasn't bad...but not nearly the best I've had. Between them and Pacer's as to which is the best in the area...as the area has very few BBQ places to choose from."}
{"text":"I have been her a couple of times now... Never had a great meal but not the worst either. They have the nastiest lady working the cash register... Very rude with poor customer service... I think it's the owner's mother or something.. I have tried the chicken wings, polish boy, an the rib dinner. Ribs reheated in the microwave if u don't get there when they take them off the grill.. Like I said nothing special... Oh, an by the way it's not the cleanest place.. No thrills here but will cure a bbq craving I guess...."}
{"text":"I ordered three bones, with sauce. The sauce is very tasty without being overpowering, sweet and tangy, hints of vinegar.  The pork is very tender.  Service was extremely fast and friendly.  The price was right, three dollars per bone and they gave me one bone for free."}
{"text":"I've been patronizing Holland for the past couple of years. I've bought there polish boys & wings on many occasions. The food has always been great and if you talk to the people who run it, they are very cordial & humorous. I've been to many bbq establishments in the past and they rate to me, just as good or better."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about this place is that they run out of stuff from time to time. But the po' boy is excellent, the ribs are great, and the cheesesteak is the best one in town. Get it. Eat it. Dream about it. To Hell with the Mr. Hero ones up the street. Dude that runs the place is always there and cooking the stuff in the parking lot next door."}
{"text":"Every day after school my kids and I walk by and smell the grill in the parking lot smoking and smelling of summer and meat. My son is always asking to eat there; however, I do most of the cooking and eating out can be expensive. The decor and building may be a bit run down, but the food smells delicious. My children and I stopped by and ordered chicken fingers and fries. It took about 5 to 10 minutes for the food to come out, but it came out hot and fresh. The chicken was real pieces of white meat with a good crust of breading. The fries, while a bit salty, were delicious and addictive. The meal was a generous helping of fries and chicken for about $5. Both my children (who can, at times, be picky) ate their meals in silence and exalted the taste. I look forward to trying some other items from the menu in the future! Call ahead ordering is available if one does not have time to wait."}
{"text":"While the inside had me kind of skeptical the BBQ chicken wings made up for any trepidation I was experiencing. The wings were made to order so they were steaming hot. They also give you plenty of sauce which a lot of places don't. My only complaint is the way it looks. Not the greatest decor. Looks like they should offer more because there was a lot of empty shelving. Maybe they used to have snacks and such."}
{"text":"When I think of Cleveland take out BBQ Holland's exemplifies it. A mixture of charcoal grilled meats, fried foods, Mac  and cheese ,wing dings, green beans... The charcoal barrel  BBQ in the parking lot that grills the meats  smells amazing.  I ordered rib tip dinner and fries, and half a slab dinner with green beans.  The portions were monster. The ribs had a lot of chew to them but decent flavor. The ribs needed to be finished in an oven to break down the meat better. served with coleslaw and 2 pieces of wheat bread from the bag. Same with the rib tips. French fries were hot and crispy but generic. Green beans were cafeteria style."}
