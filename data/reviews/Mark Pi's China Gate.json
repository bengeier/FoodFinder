{"text":"Initially when I walked in to pick up my family's order I was awestruck when I saw how beautiful the interior was. The stunning zen waterfall walls, the dragon fountain in the middle, the noir dark lighting creating the perfect ambiance, I wish I could say the same for the food. The ginger chicken was soggy and tasted cheap as if the flavor was just from a packet of sweet n sour and left a gross bubbly almost swampy feeling in my stomach. Up next was the chicken teriyaki, I didn't realize my brother ordered Sakio chicken, actually I wish he did because it may have at least smelled like Teriyaki and MAY HAVE EVEN HAD REASONABLE SIZED VEGETABLES. The vegetables for ALL of the dishes were basically whole sized chunks rather than slices, didn't realize this place was challenging my culinary abilities (of which I lack). The shrimp asparagus was the worst when It came to the size of each individual vegetable. The sweet n sour pork tasted like packaging peanuts. The ONLY redeeming factor about this place is their eggdrop soup which surprisingly didn't taste like fish tank water. All and all, it could be a great place to eat if you go in for drinks and have no expectations. The amount of work they put on their store interior doesn't show in their food."}
{"text":"After reading reviews about the \"Nasty rude owner\" me and my wife decided to give this place a try for fun to see how rude he or she actually is lol.Well we did not get to experience their presence but maybe that's a good thing.To be honest the restaurant is very nicely decorated it makes you feel like your in a high end restaurant but the waitress was not very friendly at all and the food (sesame chicken and garlic chicken) was actually very good quality but it lacked one major thing and that's flavor! It seemed like the sauces and even the pop were like watered down very bland tasting.We would of been a loyal customer if the food was good but unfortunately it's far from.So we will continue to drive all the way to Elyria to get Golden Ginger easily the best place in Lorain County"}
{"text":"The Empire Roll is to die for, consistently!  Other sushi offerings are good but not to the same level.  The service is generally good at the wait staff level however when it is off the servers can be surly."}
{"text":"It's a great place for sushi in the Avon/Avon Lake area. I love the waitresses, they are all so nice. It's my place to go on a bad day to lift my spirits :)"}
{"text":"Great sushi and Chinese food.  We've never had a bad meal here.  Staff is very friendly.  It's our go to for sushi and Chinese."}
{"text":"I have never had a dining experience worse than this.  I promise I am not exaggerating.  My husband and I just moved to the area and had been looking for a good Chinese restaurant.  We found this one and immediately thought this would be a great hit.  The restaurant appeared to had just been remodeled, and had a lovely dragon sushi bar and fish tank.  We were excited to try the restaurant out.

We were greeted promptly and our server was friendly. We ordered appetizers while we reviewed the dinner menu. My husband settled on sesame chicken and I was considering the crispy duck.  The problem was there was no description of the crispy duck meal, so I had to ask our server for details.  She told me it was breaded and deep fried duck.  Sounded fine to me, so I ordered it.

Our pot stickers and crab Rangoon arrived and were tasty.  Our dinner came out just a few minutes later. The sesame chicken looked nice, but my duck was an issue the moment I laid eyes on it.  It was presented as two duck legs and a chopped up duck body. The white plate was greasy all around the rim above and below.  I took a bite of duck from the side of the plate and immediately regretted it.  It was a mish mash of meat, skin bone and cartilage.  No breading, and just a little warm.  I needed to spit it out which was really embarrassing!  Our server came back and asked how it was, and I told her I wasn't really sure, I didn't think it was what she described, but I would try some more.  (I detest sending food back, it always makes me feel like I just don't know how to read a menu).

I took one more bite from the middle of my plate.  It was cold.  Not room temperature, but out of the fridge cold. I literally let it fall out of my mouth.  Our server came back and I explained to her that I would not eat it because it hadn't been cooked anytime recently.  The owner came over and rather than apologizing for something obviously unacceptable, she argued with me and told me it was roast duck and not deep fried.  Fine, I told her no matter how it was prepared, it was supposed to be hot.  She actually then told me \"everybody makes mistakes\". I lost it.  No one who works at a restaurant should make a mistake like that.  The food had clearly been cooked at an other time, pulled out of the fridge when I ordered it and merely reheated (and not thoroughly even).  We asked for the duck to be taken off our check, and for our check right away so we could leave immediately.  We got more arguing at which point everyone had raised their voices.  We couldn't get out of the restaurant fast enough, but the owner had to get the last word in.  The whole experience was unbelievable.  So sad, we really wanted to like this place, but I wouldn't even recommend it to someone I hated."}
{"text":"Went to Mark Pis on a Saturday evening.  While the dining room was mostly empty, there was a steady stream of carry out orders.  The server was very helpful in explaining the dishes, and the owner was very gracious. The restaurant offers typical Chinese fare, but also serves Thai and sushi.  Some nights the sushi is half off, which is a great deal.  While prices are on the high side, the ambiance is upscale with high quality furnishings and artwork.  We had a variety of dishes which were all very good."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite Chinese food around, but seriously overpriced. Like unbelievably sometimes. $10 for chicken lo mein? It is good, but you still get the occasional nasty piece of chicken in there, not sure if it's really worth that price. It is only a little take out paper size too. Kind of a rip."}
{"text":"Got take-out Friday. Dumplings, pork fried rice & Szechuan broccoli. Had a 20 min. wait for the dumplings, they look exactly like pot stickers , who knew dumplings & pot stickers are the same shape, not this guy or the kitchen help (pot stickers were good). lots of tasty sliced pork in fried rice which was quite bland & the broccoli was lousy - sauce & broccoli both. Off night? Heard good things about here but Ain't going back. on the plus side staff is friendly, place looks pretty nice too."}
{"text":"Our first visit after many recommendations. We came in for lunch on a Saturday and sat at the sushi bar. The staff are friendly they went out of their way to provide great service and the sushi was good. Very filling and they have great weekly specials"}
{"text":"Service is not consistent, but the food is the best Chinese cuisine you'll find in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The food is honestly really good, but the owner is SO rude. I ordered takeout and when I went in to pickup the order, the owner immediately started rushing me and screaming at me \"what is your name?\". I told her and then she screamed \"what is your phone number we have 3 of the same name\". I'm sick of being treated like this at this restaurant. A time before when I dined in, she was screaming at a staff member by the register. Why treat people so badly? Never going back. I'll take my business where it's appreciated."}
{"text":"Oh Mark Pi, unfortunately I think now is the time that we need to see other people.

I was in your place in late March on a Thursday evening to pick up takeout.  Business was bustling.  I noticed two different parties that were waiting for takeout say to gentleman that was minding the register (owner?), \"Is that my takeout that is sitting on the chair over there?\"  In both cases the customer was correct.  I really wonder how long the orders would have waited there until the owner noticed.

Ordered two dishes \"extra hot\" along with an order of Pad Thai.  This has been a continual theme with you, Mark Pi, even though I have begged you to spice up the dishes as I ask.  Both these dishes arrived to me with little to no spice/heat level in it at all.  What's the big deal, you ask?  It happens time and time again, Mark Pi.  I've overlooked it because the food has always been correct, hot (heat-wise) and very good.  However, I no longer can look the other way, Mark Pi.  I've just had enough.  I've asked countless times for the dishes to be prepared extra hot.  I even get asked the usual \"On a scale of 1 to 10, where would you like it?\"  Maybe because I jokingly say \"11 ... I can handle it ... seriously ... please!\"  But no ... you chose to act otherwise.  Mark Pi, I'm the customer in our relationship ... please try to accommodate the request.

BTW, the pad thai was fair at best.  Relatively dry, in fact.  The non-spicy dishes ... they were good.  However, I've just gotten tired of begging and never receiving.

Will I be back, Mark Pi to renew our relationship.  Oh probably ... the food is good.  However I really don't like seeing the major lapses in service.  I know that when I come in every few weeks, no staff faces look familiar.  I could see the expression on the face of the high schooler who was frantically trying to help the cashier/owner that Thursday.  It said to me, \"I'm disgusted trying to help and getting no where.\"  He was continually being berated by the owner.  I'm sure he will soon be long gone. Don't know if it's a language barrier or else a difference in cultural upbringing but I'm guessing it's not working.

So for now, let's take some time off from each other.  I'm sure we will maybe get back together but for know, I'm looking for someone else."}
{"text":"After we finished dinner the owner came over to our table to refill our waters.  When we told her were just having water she was shocked and said we needed to buy a pop with our half price sushi. I told her that we were nott informed of that by our waitress and we were finished so we did nott want the pops. The owner actually came back with the pops. The sushi was terrible and service was worse. There are may other places you can go for much better service and better sushi."}
{"text":"I'm fat. I get it.  So is my husband...but this experience was pretty humiliating.  We were meeting another couple for dinner.  They arrived first and were seated in a booth.  We arrive and scoot in.  It's a snug fit but we're fine.  Someone came up and asked us to move to a table to be more comfortable.  We said we were fine.  Again she said we looked uncomfortable and we should move...and again we told her no.  She made another comment and then I just started ignoring her.  Like I said -- yes, I'm fat...this isn't breaking news.  But her pointing wording things in this way in front of our much-thinner friends was really challenging and embarrassing.  I left most of my dinner on the plate because it really soured my experience for me.

The food I did have was good.  I had the teryaki chicken and my husband had sushi.  The server was attentive.  That was all overshadowed by our experience with the first person though.  I doubt we will ever return."}
{"text":"This was a very poor experience for my girlfriend and I. There were flies swarming our heads. We were the only ones in the place and the service was slow (we were there for an hour and a half and ordered nothing special). 
The worst part of it was our waitress taking off her shoe and sock to show the owner some sort of foot problem she was having. About 2 minutes later, she was serving our food. I was cringing... it was rough... I will not return."}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't come here accidentally on their half off sushi day (Wednesday). Even if you spend $250 on duck and drinks, the leftovers are NOT allowed to leave the premises and there are NO substitutions! NO EXCEPTION!!! Yet none of this is listed anywhere on the menu. You'd think that they'd rather people actually eat their food rather than just pay for it and throw it out. I'd actually rather just drive two exits up 90 to Vieng's anyway."}
{"text":"My first time trying Mark Pi (late to the party). This is a carry out review. I can't say I enjoyed anything about my food. Ordered War Su gai with fried rice and vegetable egg roll. Everything was tasteless and mushy. My first try will be my last."}
{"text":"I love Mark Pi's food! Never greasy, delicious and not \"fast foodie\" \"cheap\" Chinese food... although, the owner is very rude. I get takeout, never a good experience when my family eats there. She degrades customers and is mean. 10 Stars for the food, 1 Star for customer service. 

I have read others claiming the food is reheated, my food has always been fresh, crisp and yummy. I really hope they aren't re-heaters, because they are my favorite local restaurant."}
{"text":"Good lunch at a good price. Just a warning they are closed from 3-4 pm for staff meal and breaks"}
{"text":"The best cashew chicken Ive ever had. Egg rolls are very good and the sushi is great too. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are a little high and I wish they delivered but its the best in town."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food prepared quickly!! I recommend dining in or take-out. It's newly decorated so give the new dining room a try."}
{"text":"I admit I almost only ever go during Wednesday night for half-priced sushi.  The service has always been good.  We used to go to Fujiyamas for half-priced sushi every Friday night but they kept serving us not-so-fresh fish so we stopped going.  I can say I haven't had anything like that happen so far at Mark Pi's.  The sushi is well prepared and tasty, no funky colors or smells, and I haven't had any next-day woes if you know what I mean.  The hostess (or is it owner?) is a character.  She's a little weird but very friendly and she always makes sure we are having a great experience.  She's got a dry, understated sense of humor, she'll crack you up if you pay attention.  A few times we've been there on a slow night and were treated to free edamame before the meal and a neatly sliced orange afterward.  Oh, and free wifi!  Between the great service and the half-price sushi Wednesday, what's not to love."}
{"text":"My husband and I prefer  to eat at the bar when dining out, regardless of the caliber of restaurant.  Last week, we decided we wanted a quiet chinese dinner with a decent glass of wine.  We thought we'd try Mark Pi's for the first time, as it was close to our house and we didn't want to drive far.  We entered and took a seat at the bar.  We were greeted by the manager, who told us that we weren't allowed to eat at the bar.  We could only drink at the bar and her reasoning was that she didn't have enough people to serve food at the bar.  So, she had the ability to serve us cocktails there, just not dinner.  I don't understand the logic so we gladly found another restaurant who would allow us to eat while we enjoyed a bottle of wine.  We will not return to Mark Pi's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go! 

My boyfriend and I go almost every Wednesday for the 1/2 off sushi, it is our favorite sushi place. I've tried their actual meals twice, cashew chicken, and the happy family meal. Both were very good!  The owner is very friendly and always makes sure to greet us when we walk in. 

definitely is a must try!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot to get a 5 star rating from me, but as far as I am concerned, Mark Pi's is the best in my book when I need a Chinese food fix. I've tried lots of places in the area, but I keep coming back here because they are consistently good and don't disappoint. 

Dine-in experience: Comfortable, relaxed, casual, and unassuming - all qualities I like in a casual dining experience. The service was very good, even when the place was busy. We made a few special requests and they got it right each time. The prices are very reasonable - I like that. I only tried one of the sushi dishes because I'm not a big sushi connoisseur, but it tasted very good. The other dishes were tasty and not over-bearing. 

To go experience: The person on the phone was very professional and made sure they had everything right. The order was ready exactly when they said it would be and she even read everything back to me to make sure it was right. Dinner for 4 = $47. Did I say the prices were reasonable? Plus, there was enough left over for either a late night snack or a light lunch the next day.

I have had food from here on 5 separate occasions (4 dine-in and 1 carry-out) and have had nothing but good experiences - that's why it gets 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, only two other parties here.  I had the sashimi, sushi, roll combo ($19.00), my wife had the lunch Pad Thai ($7.00).  The food and service was very good.  The interior of the restaurant is nicely decorated and spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"We have eaten here dozens of times, but we will not go back.  Our experiences with the owner and her stingy ways have forced us to conduct our own personal boycott, which is a shame, as this is the only Chinese restaurant in Avon Lake that is above the sad new standard of sub-mediocrity that has become Chinese takeout.  
We had an issue during a dinner one night where the owner simply would not accept the fact that I didn't like the taste of one of my sushi rolls -- going so far as to bring the raw fish from the sushi bar, asking me to smell it, and insisting it was fresh (which was not even my complaint, by the way).   I was very kind in my complaint, but she would just not accept.  She had the sushi chef make her the same roll, ate it, and told me she thought it was fine.  (!!)
As other reviews have stated below, the bottom line is that she's cheap, and her cheapness trumps friendliness.  She has always been very friendly to my family, but my wife and I simply don't want to patronize a restaurant with such terrible customer relations."}
{"text":"Having been to and loving the Mark Pi's in Columbus, IN, we decided to try this one in Avon Lake, OH. So glad we did! The restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was very attentive, and the food was delicious. We had such a lovely experience! We ordered the BBQ ribs, egg rolls, Kung Pao Scallops, and Duck Breast with almonds. Everything was delicious, and fresh. Also ordered their plumtini, which was tasty and refreshing.  Loved the Kung Pao sauce, it was spicy, had a nice heat, so if you don't like spicy, ask them for not so spicy. They have a sushi chef, unfortunately we were so full from our meal that we weren't able to order the Friday night Sushi special. Hopefully, another time!!!"}
{"text":"I would go back for the moo sho pork. Very good. The California roll was good, pad Thai was just okay. Pot stickers were good, crab Rangoon was okay. We would go there again."}
{"text":"Good place for Chinese, sushi and Thai. Had the pad Thai and it was great. Good spice and flavor. Had some sushi which was also good. Atmosphere is very nice - not what you would expect from a Chinese restaurant. Good service And very attentive owners. 

Much different and better than other Mark Pi restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Tuesday night.  Place was only moderately busy, but got busier by the time we left.  Seated immediately and, for the most part, received prompt service throughout the meal.

Given the prices for the items (which aren't crazy, but what you would expect for a sit-down Chinese restaurant), you would expect the quality and quantity of the food to be better than your average Chinese take-out.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  The hot and sour soup was plenty hot, but didn't taste particularly fresh.  The egg rolls seemed to have been frozen, and the General (Tso's) Chicken was average.  I asked for white meat (as the dark meat pieces always seem to have a questionable quality), but that was not an option.

Basically, my search for quality Chinese fare in the Avon/Avon Lake area continues..."}
{"text":"even tho this is a chain restaurant, this is actually pretty good asian food! i love the chicken pad thai.... a lot! the portions are huge and i believe they have 1/2 price sushi on weds nights.
for a chain restaurant, not so shabby. i personally prefer to avoid chains like the plague and frequent the independently owned businesses, but if you are craving some asian dishes, and you are on the west side, you can check mark out. 
the restaurant has overwent a makeover from the original back in the early 2000's. i think there are other options that are a wee bit better, but will not completely rule out!"}
{"text":"I would happily have given this place a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the owner and bad service.  If it wasn't for their great food I think they'd have closed a long time ago...we go there often for their half price sushi and love it but we do this understanding that the workers their seem miserable and the owner doesn't seem to like customers..especially children, obvious since they don't offer a kids menu. She seems annoyed if children even come into the place. She's yelled at people for wanting to move tables because they were cold or asking for a booth when she wants you at a table...it's bad. We've learned to ignore her but it's a horrible way to run a business."}
{"text":"I was recently at a friend's house in Avon Lake.  My wife and I live on the East Side, and my wife and her best friend were out for a girls' night.  So, her friend's husband and I had a man date, which involved keeping an eye on our dogs and their daughter.

My friend asked if I wanted Chinese food, and it sounded great.  He told me that there was this \"great\" place he's ordered from... better than all of the other noise out there.  He pulled up the menu on his iPad and showed it to me, and I was excited to see that it was for Mark Pi's.

We used to have a Mark Pi's in Mansfield where I grew up, and it went out of business a loooooong time ago.  So, I missed it.

I'll cut to the chase.  I ordered the Hunan Chicken, and it was outstanding.  I asked for it spicy because most of these restaurants are catering to white people who don't understand Asian levels of spicy.  Hunan Chicken should come very spicy without having to ask, but it never does.  Usually, I ask for it \"very very very very spicy\" and it comes out about half as spicy as a Wendy's Spicy Chicken Sandwich.  Huge bummer. But I asked, and it came the perfect amount of spicy.  This is a first for me!

The chicken was tender without being mushy - it felt and tasted like actual chicken, not some kind of mechanically separated poultry by-product.  The vegetables were crisp, and I didn't get a giant pile of Bok Choy to take up space, much to my delight.  Broccoli, water chestnuts, baby corn, and carrots... and a few pea pods.  All good stuff.  

The sauce was super flavorful in addition to being hot.  There was a slow, steady burn that was with me all night, and it was just delightful.  My buddy went to go pick up the food, and while it wasn't very far away from his house, he was still back remarkably fast.  

The prices were right, the food was absolutely wonderful, and I even got a little bit of nostalgia out of it.

Easily the best Chinese food I've had in my 7 years in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Let me just start off with the pros. The inside of the restaurant is very nice - a different atmosphere for most chinese restaurants. Our server was very attentive and for the amount of food that you during lunch was a good price for a meal with rice.

Cons:
1. We ordered half price sushi - after we ordered we were told that we had to buy a drink as well. I had already bought a drink, but my husband hadn't and was required to. The sushi itself tasted pretty good. My husband and I got 2 separate rolls (I can't remember the names). His roll was a full sushi rool (8 pieces). I had ordered a roll with tempura covering it and I got 4 pieces...and we couldn't see/taste any yellowfin tuna in the roll. We questioned the waiter about the tuna and the owner came over. She pointed out that there WAS tune in the roll above the avocado and cream cheese...we just couldn't see it. Wellllll the reason we couldn't really see it was because it was BARELY there! I'm talking about the amount of tuna in the roll was not comparable to the sushi I've had at any other asian restaurant. Half price sushi really isn't a good deal if you get half of a sushi roll with no rish in it...
2. I got the teryiaki chicken and my husband got the general tso's. Neither were impressive. Not horrible, but not great. 

We will keep on looking..."}
{"text":"I've been coming here over half my life and love it. I was surprised to see so many negative reviews. I recently dined here again on my Christmas visit and found it to be just as good as I remembered. The restaurant has plenty of seating and is very nice inside for a small, local restaurant. The owner is always friendly and makes me feel welcome. When my brother and I would come back during college breaks she always remembered us and greeted us warmly. 

Hands down my favorite dish here has always been the General Chicken. The chicken is tender, there are plenty of vegetables, and the sauce has a nice heat and flavor. On my most recent visit I had the Pad Thai with chicken which was delicious. It didn't have as many other goodies like egg and spices that most Asian restaurants add, but the flavor of the dish was spot on. I also enjoyed a sushi roll that was fresh and plentiful for one roll. 

The pricing is very reasonable for the quality and portions. I live in Las Vegas now so I laughed when I saw how reasonable the prices are compared to what I pay for food here. 

I hope this spot is around for many years to come so that I can continue to return on visits home. I'm glad to see that over all these years they've only gotten better."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from Mark Pi's - quick pick up process, food was packaged well including sushi, and tasted great. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here on my lunch break for work with some other colleagues for sushi. I had the Nemo role which was very good and generally what I would pay for sushi but a little bit smaller than what I normally would expect. It was very good. I felt the fish was of good quality and very tasty. I was a little surprised that I was charged $1 for a side of spicy mayo which I didn't feel compared to spicy mayo I've had at other establishments. My colleague got the lunch special which I felt was actually a really good deal. It was three of their smaller sushi rolls for $11 when you buy a drink. She had the Philadelphia roll, the spicy tuna roll, The California roll which she shared with me and I also felt they were really good. I've read reviews were they felt the service wasn't very good here but I didn't have any issues I felt like our waiter was very friendly and kind of a jokester. I had a great time and enjoy the food. (Sorry I was so hungry I forgot to take a picture until I was halfway through my meal lol)"}
{"text":"Let me first state that I am giving this restaurant four stars for carry-out only. I have not had the distinct pleasure of dining in that so many of you have described, and now I most certainly will NOT eat in the restaurant. 

I have ordered a variety of items from the restaurant and everything has been delicious (most recently combo lo mein). I am not a sushi expert by any means, but I have really liked everything I have tried. Compared to many Chinese carryout restaurants, I think this is better than most of the greasy options around town.

They REALLY need to add descriptions to their carryout menus. 
For half-off sushi on Wednesdays, they need to advertise ON THE BANNER hanging out front that your must purchase a beverage."}
{"text":"Super friendly service with a great happy hours list of both food and drinks.  It has  a great seating arrangement and nice patio."}
{"text":"Best Chinese style food around. Tonya the owner is great and super friendly. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night as I had been out all day and just didn't feel like cooking and we happened to be in the area.

What a pleasant surprise, the restaurant is very nice and clean.  It is definitely a step above most Chinese restaurants in the area.  

I ordered the sesame chicken and my husband ordered the cashew chicken.  Both dishes were excellent and the presentation was very nicely done.

I think I have found my go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and large portions! They're newly remodeled and it's beautiful inside!  They have been serving sushi for a few months now and the prices are very reasonable.  They have a sushi special and it's amazing!  Can't beat the price!  The owner is very friendly and appreciates your business."}
