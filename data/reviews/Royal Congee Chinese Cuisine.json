{"text":"Very good chinese food in nicely renovated clean building. Similar to Congee Queen with many identical dishes and pricing. Underwhelming part of Scarborough and the plaza that its located in is not much to look at however the food is delicious and friendly service too."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out and ate in at this restaurant many times. Food is always good! Try the spicy squid or the sizzling pepper steak. It gets busy on weeknights with take out orders but usually the food comes out in 20 min."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Staff are courteous and the order came fast. I was delighted by the quality of the food. Very fresh and authentic."}
{"text":"The food is really good. Clean environment for peaceful family lunch and dinner. The service can be better and they should have value meal plan for the weekend."}
{"text":"Great value.  9 bucks for large bowl of congee is comparable to other places.  The place has a lots of locals, clean, but modernish look of the restaurant is a bit out of place for the Plaza location.  I would not go out of my way to come here, but it's a good value small restaurant to go to if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is a new addition to the plaza. My family and I came by on a Saturday night. We ordered Pork Liver Congee, Blood Tofu & Minced Beef Congee, Fried Udon with Sliced Beef & Soy Sauce, Deep Fried Chicken Wings, Steamed fish in Soy Sauce and Youtiao (??). Everything was very tasty and flavorful. The restaurant does not have much space for too many big groups, but looks modern and clean. As we dined, we saw many come and go for take out. This seems like a good place to get lunch for people who work in the area. They offer lunch combo special for $5.99 and up and also delivery is free over $25. It might be that this place is new, but the service was above par compared to other Chinese restaurants. There is also free wifi. 

Overall
Food - 4/5
Service 5/5
Decor 4/5
Value 5/5

This is a welcome addition to the area. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came to this little gem tucked away in the Greystone plaza for an early lunch at 11:30 am on Saturday. Great Chinese congee place, attentive service and kid friendly. We ordered salt and pepper calamari, pork chop soup noodle, ying yang fried rice, bbq pork, Choy sum oyster sauce. Food tasted great and on par with congee queen. Didn't try the congee but will definitely go back again. Clean Chinese restaurant and washroom facilities."}
{"text":"YUUUUM! :)

Freezing a$$ day = Congee on the mind.

At the behest of my sweetie we went Royal Congee Chinese Cuisine. Don't expect much like we didn't and you'll be fine! The place is in a half run down plaza that doesn't strike hope in the hearts of men but inside...inside lays yummy yummy congee that has great consistency and flavour. Also it's almost HALF the COST of congee queen. (super congee at least, we got A7) and had almost twice as much ingredients in the congee. Such a wonderful delight. Deep fried squid was bomb, but Singapore Fried Vermicelli was lacking the spice. Overall, we're thinking of going again tomorrow. And it was fun after dinner, sipping tea and listening to the cooks at the next table, talk about gambling (we were the last ones in there).

I give it 4 kung fu kicks out of 5."}
{"text":"This took over the old spot where Lam Kee BBQ restaurant in the Greystone plaza was which I was very sad to see as the previous owners were very nice people so I felt like going here was a small betrayal somehow to the previous owners.  After a dental appointment, I desperately needed something soft to eat so I begrudgingly stopped by Royal Congee as it was nearby. 

The place was clean and was made to look like a smaller version of the Congee Queens around the city... quite nice and a great use of the space. I ordered Shrimp Congee with Dough fritter (they didn't carry rice noodle roll to wrap around it to make it my usual chaleung but what can you do) and Fukien Fried Rice to go. Service was quick and friendly. They also deliver food over $25 which is what made the old Lam Kee popular during our last minute parties.

I was in such a blur from the dentist that I forgot to take pictures but the food was delicious! The Congee was perfectly seasoned and can stand on its own without any soy sauce or shrimp required.  Their dough fritter was crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.  Their Fukien fried rice was exactly what I was expecting - I was not disappointed as their food was on point. 

However, I didn't commit to a full 5 due to their portions... the Congee and dough fritter (2 pieces cut in half) was good - they filled the container as expected.   Their fried rice, however, was more comparable to that of other Congee places midtown (maybe slightly less than what you get at Congee star, Congee queen, Congee King and definitely less than what you get in Congee places in Richmond court) but considering there are at least 2 Hakka joints within 5 minutes whose fried rice fills BOTH sides of the container to where it needs a rubber band to keep it from pushing off its clips while this place only fills the BOTTOM part of the to go container 3/4ths of the way for 3 dollars more, I was expecting a little more bang for my buck due to its local comparators.  I get that they can't fill it like Hakka places do but filling the container a little more would at least not make me notice the portion difference. That being said, I plan on going back to try other items from their menu before finalizing the 4 star rating and am hoping that their portions improve once they've scoped the area. So to sum it up, good food so far,  pricing more on the top Congee Queen end ($9+) rather than the local chinese food end, selection is good, and service was good, but portion can be improved.  Value for money still to be determined."}
{"text":"This place had recently opened up near my girlfriend's place and honestly, this was my 2nd time going (first time was with her family for dinner). We dropped in at around 4:00pm, the place was somewhat deserted which was good for us hehehe. Anyways, we ordered the Super Supreme Congee Bowl which had various pieces of seafood, beef and they even added a raw egg in it (it wasn't on top but was in the middle of the congee), good thing my girlfriend decided to stir the congee up before we consumed it or else, I think it would have ended badly for the both of us. Very flavourful, add some hot oil if you like it spicy ;) or add a drop of soy sauce if it's too bland. The second dish we ordered Singaporean style fried turnip cakes. We had this on our first visit too, my girlfriend was hesitant the first time because she thought it was tofu but I told her they were turnip cakes and it was delicious and she should try...now it's one of her favourite dishes ahaha. They were good as well although lacking a crunch factor. The last dish we ordered was sweet and sour pork. Honestly that was one of my favourite sweet and sour pork I've have. Sauce wasn't drowning the pork and evenly distributed throughout the dish. 

Service for the first visit was lacking and disorganized (I think we went during their opening week so they didn't have a proper billing system) but upon my 2nd visit, everything was prompt, stress free. The waitress was very pleasant and very on point. I have some complaints about the waiter though. He was blasting music from his phone while on duty (BIG NO NO) and didn't even service us even though he saw us before the waitress did, he actually told the waitress to go help us and stayed seated on his lazy ass until the chef barked at him to bring our food out.

Overall:
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5

Final score: 8.5/10"}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese restaurants in the area. The menu is very similar to most Chinese restaurants and very comprehensive. They also have a dim sum menu. 

The food quality is good and consistent. Service is decent and relatively quick. The kitchen wastes no time and food is prepared fast so you won't be waiting for long. 


Overall, if you're in the area and want Chinese food, it's a very good pick."}
{"text":"Had takeout numerous times, rice dishes kids loved.  Decided to have a sit down lunch on Sunday, invited the extended family, party of 14.  They got swamped and some of our orders came late or did not get made.  The food was great, the General Tsao was a nice surprise better than other similar restaurants.   The sweet and sour pork was similar to mall food, think Manchu wok.  Overall a good experience in a quiet corner of scarborough, a good local spot.  Service should improve since management did apologize and did tell us that they are getting another server."}
{"text":"Great congee spot in Scarborough! Comparable to congee star, king and queen. I've only tried take out meat congee and it was delicious. Their Cantonese chow mein is legit. Loved their fried rice noodle with beef and bean sprout. So happy that they have a small selection of dim sum but only tried har gow and it was yummy. Others dishes I've tried and enjoyed was the shrimp fried rice and spicy salty squid. Definitely going back again!"}
