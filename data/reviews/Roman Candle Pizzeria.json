{"text":"Yum! Roman Candle is delicious!

Their red pepper and tomato soup is AMAZING! So flavorful and rich.

My two favorite pizzas are The Roman Candle (spicy sauce, Italian sausage, briny banana peppers) and the barbecue chicken (BBQ sauce, green peppers, red onion, tender chicken, and optional jalape√±os).

I watched my beau devour a generous spinach salad that he really enjoyed.

Service has always been good. Attentive, but without making you feel rushed.

But seriously, get the soup!"}
{"text":"Yum! The Vegan destroyer with the fireworks sauce is sooo good. The pizza is delicious and not overly greasy. Takes a little longer than the bigger chains like dominos, but well worth the wait. On the pricier side, but the ingredients are high quality. Wish it were a little more affordable though, I would definitely order more often if it were!"}
{"text":"Standard moderately thin crust pizza. Several non-standard bottled soda choices. Comfortable atmosphere for adults or families. Not spectacular but has been a reliably good experience for me."}
{"text":"We have ordered from Roman Candle numerous times this summer for neighborhood gatherings.   I've been very impressed how Roman Candle has something for everyone (gluten free, vegan, vegetarian).  Delivery time has been exceptional and the pizza was always hot."}
{"text":"Wow. What a disaster. 

Let us start with the help. The help clearly is arrogant, and go out of their way to give off a vibe of 'I do not want to be here'. We were seated inside, and we only saw our waitress 2 times. We guessed she stopped caring about us since we did not order drinks nor soda - we just had water. No drinks = lower tip = ignore this table. What was she doing  all of this time? Her face was stuck to her iphone, texting away or whatever. 

Now for the \"food\". The good part - it was edible, and we did not get sick. The bad part - the 'pizza' was disgusting. We both ordered a simple Margarita Pizza. It took 45 minutes to get this pizza to us. FORTY FIVE minutes - and this was not at lunch rush or at a packed dinner time. 

The 'pizza' was soggy in the middle, burnt on the outside crust to the point where when we tried to pick up a slice, the 'crust' would vaporize in a puff of charcoal like dust. The cheese was almost nonexistent on the pizza. One tiny quarter size patch of cheese. Totally absurd for the price they charge. We told the waitress that the pizza was undercooked in the middle, and showed it to her, and all she said was 'This is how we cook it here'. Wow. 

Being from New York City, I know pizza sauce. The sauce they served us was NOT fresh - it clearly had the canned taste. 

On top of all of this, this restaurant is not even part of the Restaurant Association anymore - a critical mistake that we only found out after wards online. 

We are all for a second chance, but we will NOT be giving this place a second chance due to the fact they seem to be calling it in and are in a 'do not care anymore' mode. We also chose to not give the waitress a tip, and we clearly explained to her why this was so. She could care less, and became visibly agitated when she found out she was not going to get a tip. We eat out very often, and in the past year out of eating easily 100 times out, this was the first time we chose not to leave a tip. 

I have no idea what is going on at this place but if they keep up this level of 'service' and 'quality' they will be going out of business in no time. Unfortunate, because we support local businesses. But we cannot in good faith support a bad business even if they are local, just to preserve a local business."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. 

A few friends and I ordered two pizzas and some bread sticks for delivery and after an hour and a half, still no pizza! We called the restaurant and the staff told us the pizza was on it's way. We waited another 45 minutes to no avail. The pizza had still not arrived. We called the restaurant once again to cancel our order and they decided to mock us by saying they would check the oven and cancel our pizza. Great way to keep customers."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say that I was very disappointed with my second visit to Roman Candle.  We were seated right away, and we got our drinks, but then we just sat there for nearly 20 minutes without getting waited on AT ALL.  The place was not busy, and many servers walked past us and repeatedly and totally ignored us, despite obviously seeing us there with the menus right in front of us.  

I tried making eye contact, and servers were obviously pretending not to notice us there.  We thought it was just totally rude and unpleasant.  During the whole time three servers were sitting about 15 feet from us, rolling silverware, and chatting.  

This is a very small restaurant, and when you are sitting there and everyone else around you is getting their food, having the servers come and ask how everything is, and you're right next to them and are being totally ignored, you basically feel like crap.  

They did not charge us for our drinks, given the long wait.  However, the manager did not personally make any attempt to apologize or explain the situation to us.  The message was relayed to us via a server.  That was the last straw."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Madison!! But I may be biased, since I live less than a block away :)"}
{"text":"I have been to the Roman Candle a few times recently, and this is not the standard pizza place with their local ingredients and awesome pizza combinations.  They always seem to be coming up with new things, the latest additions to their menu are new coulis, though they call them drizzles or something silly.  They have a spicy pineapple drizzle which is my favorite it is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  Their crust is amazing, I absolutely hate thicker crusts and they have nailed it perfectly.
Be warned though if you call for delivery or dine in on a Friday night they can get pretty busy and backed up but once your pizza arrives it's well worth the wait.
BBQ Chicken - My Favorite"}
{"text":"Pizza not that great; sometimes burned; and the salad  not fresh, and looks old; dry, and the service is really bad; either the real server is out and not at work yet,  and when you find someone, she won't take the order as she is doing something else, and so I should wait for this supposedly real server, or  they chat in one corner, and takes a long time for someone to come to your table;   it is highly chaotic- am not going back there. Odd service; it;s a good place for kids, I guess. They need to replace this place with professional people; or who really enjoys working there."}
{"text":"Though it's doubtless that The Roman Candle (TRC) has many delicious offerings on their menu, in my visits to the Willy Street location, I have never been able to get past the pizza. Their pizza is scrumptious, addictive, and just short of intoxicating. A magic balance of flavorful crust, sauces and toppings has been achieved. The incredibly rich, cheesy, and unique Alfredo Pizza must be tasted to be believed. And, I am now a believer...especially in the efficacy of using fresh, local ingredients to craft extraordinarily delicious food.

In my visits to TRC, I usually include the Triple Pepperoni Pizza. This pie is a carnivore's delight. It sports three different kinds of pepperoni which marry to give this pizza a savory meatiness that I've not experienced elsewhere. With gastric juices now flowing at Warp 10, I usually round off my gluttony with two scoops of Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream--all of which gets washed down with a Sprecher's Root Beer. However, a number of local beers and wines are also available.

I'd be remiss in my review of the Willy Street TRC if I failed to mention their friendly and attentive staff. Food is prepared in a timely manner and tabled according to the customers' wishes. In my visits I have never been greeted by anything less than a smile and a cheerful attitude. The combination of tables and booths is adequate and the overhead music is kept at a comfortable volume. Prices are moderate.

I plead guilty to ignoring other menu items that have been given the same artisanship afforded the pizza. However, in future visits, I hope to try some of TRC's non-pizza offerings.

One of the greatest pleasures of the human experience is to eat. Don't risk denying yourself the pleasure of The Roman Candle."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Madison. Try the original \"Roman Candle.\" Very friendly and fast delivery."}
{"text":"I've probably eaten Roman Candle pizza at least 20 times.  It's a good place to go for a low key dinner.  They have a lot of interesting topping combos you can get and the crust is thin and crispy.  Their salads are good as well.  I like the house salad, which usually has some nice veggies as well as bacon and blue cheese.  They usually have some pretty good local beers on tap.  It's not the cheapest place in town, but I think you get what you pay for here.  Also, delivery can be a little iffy."}
{"text":"I don't usually eat pizzas that much on my own because my work place caters them all the time for events and functions, but when I do, Roman Candle is one of the places I would go to. 

I love their pestoral pizza! Featuring Spring Green basil, house-blend cheese, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, fresh tomatoes and Wisconsin feta over pesto, all the yummy toppings on a pizza. 

The new hot-wa-ii is also awesome. It's similar to a hawaii pizze, but comes with Roman Candle's own Fireworks sauce (caution: spicy) and Pineapple-Chipotle drizzle.

Great variety of pizzas for hanging out with friends or snuggling in house for a movie, pizzas for every occasion ~~"}
{"text":"Roman Candle is our favorite place to go to for pizza and we travel 30 miles for a fix.  The crust is thin and crispy and the toppings are very fresh. You may wait a little for a fresh made pie, but it is worth it!  I also love the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. The quality is very high and the price is reasonable for expensive ingredients, ( fresh mixed greens, blue cheese, bacon, cherry tomatoes). It helps stave off hunger if you're too hungry to wait for your pizza!"}
{"text":"They make a decent pie. Interesting combinations instead of the usual fare. The price, I think, is about $5 too high for what you get, but it is fairly tasty."}
{"text":"Very good food;  great location.  Not as child-friendly as some of the other locations.  Pizza, wings, good drinks.   Service is slow, slow, slow.  Service is friendly but just not competent."}
{"text":"My middle name is pizza...or at least I wish it was!

When I first moved to Madison, this was one of the first places I ate at.  I wasn't disappointed :)  They have really quirky pizza selections, which can be fun to try every now and then to spice things up (particularly if you're a pizza addict like me!)  However, you can order whatever kind of pizza you want if you're not into trying something different.  The Roman Candle was tasty, but beware of the peppers if you're not into spicy foods.

My middle name is also ice cream and they have that here too!  The espresso oreo is the bomb.  Be sure to join the birthday club so you can get a free beer on your special day.  Make sure to get the Spotted Cow!

p.s. The music selection is rad--the waiters/waitresses seem to make up their own mixes which can then be enjoyed by hipster/punk/nerdy customers like myself."}
{"text":"I can only give Roman Candle 4 stars as it's a pizzeria, and it is my conclusion that it should be judged on its pizza.  Its pizza rates a 3.5 star at best.  Not bad, but not anything out of the ordinary.  That said, it rates higher for me for the amazing salads and the comfortable environment, it doesn't feel the need to give you sensory overload, except where smells are concerned, and, in a restaurant, that's a good thing.  I enjoy sitting outside and it's within walking distance of my house, so it's a tasty, affordable dinner.  All in all, it should be a 5, but like I said, the pizza's nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I've loved Roman Candle forever, so I was thrilled to hear that they were coming to my neighborhood. The bar is really nice, I have enjoyed meeting the very friendly staff, and give four stars instead of five only because we haven't had the full experience yet. We enjoyed some great conversation at the bar, with a really nice selection of tap beers, and have taken one order out. Will be back soon for the eat- in experience!"}
{"text":"In the mass-dating phase of pizza ordering as a new Madisonian, I met up with Roman Candle's for a quick fling.  Unfortunately, my first impressions certainly will not leave me in the mood for a second outing any time soon.  

My hopes started out high, as my pizza and salad were quickly delivered by a friendly delivery girl.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be the highlight of the experience. The meatball sub pizza I ordered was no better than bland, with even the \"(lack -of)-seasoned meatballs\" tasting like mere lumps of meat.  The spinach salad fared better, and was more along the lines of decent.  Not bad, but not exceptional either.  I may have allowed Roman Candle to scrape by with 3 stars as a result, but I simply can't justify the price they charged for my box of sauced-up cardboard."}
{"text":"I would've given 4.5 stars, but that stupid feature isn't working correctly at all on my mobile. I'm here, for the first time, and in town on business. I really did not want to eat from the hotel's limited menu from their restaurant. I wanted something local, yummy, comforting, and I kept thinking about pizza. I don't like Chicago-style pizza. So I flipped through a visitor guide for Middleton and read what The Roman Candle's food is about.  

I called to order, and forgive me not remembering the name of the guy who answered. He was very nice. I immediately asked if the crust was Chicago-style, and when he said,\"No\", I was happy.

I ordered a medium (14\") supreme pizza, no onions, extra mushrooms. The crust was delicious, not tough or crispy, just right. The sauce, of which I asked for extra, was so flavorful with a hint of a kick, something spicy, but even the spice-averse would love it. The sausage....I don't know if they make their own, but ot was HANDS DOWN the best sausage I've ever had on a pizza. The pepperoni looked fresher than what you usually get in more common pizza chains, and the veggies...so good.

I'll definitely be ordering this pizza again, will recommend it to my co-workers who will be coming here on business, and will miss it when I leave to go back home in Houston. 

Bravo, Roman Candle!
Angie"}
{"text":"Great pizza! They have a kids' play climber in the basement, which is awesome if you have kids. What the wait staff lacks for in skill (some seem a little green), they definitely make up for in friendliness. We have never had a bad experience here!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison. Great list of toppings. Good beers on tap. I would not order this for delivery, as it is best when hot, so EAT IN. People complaining about the service need to relax or assert themselves."}
{"text":"Roman Candle is pretty hyped in Madison as being one of the best pizza joints in town. First of all, it is very expensive, so for the price one would expect a gourmet pizza. The 16 inch pizza we ordered was sparsely strewn with toppings and was warm, not even hot. The ingredients are very good, but for the price, the crust should really taste better. A pretty bland and boring crust. Sauce was good. Toppings were tasty. Overall, a pretty good pizza, but not nearly worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm normally a fan of this restaurant and my wife and I stopped in tonight to celebrate my birthday. After waiting for around 15 minutes someone finally asked if we had been waited on. We said no and got menus and asked for a minute to look at the menu before ordering drinks. After another 15 minutes without anyone stopping by to take our order we got up and left. This was by far the worst experience at this restaurant we've had.

I'm giving the restaurant 2 stars because the food is good, but a number of years ago they changed some things on their menu and it was just another pizza place for me. But after tonight not sure when we'll visit next. Probably won't be for a while."}
{"text":"Wife and I have always enjoyed our visits. We've only had the pizzas recently, but in the past I've loved to get the cheesey bread and the tomato bisque soup. Yum! My mom's not so impressed with it, but I know my wife and I love it. The pizzas tend to be a little less greasy then other pizza joints we frequent. Last time in even had a vegan pizza without cheese and enjoyed it. (Ok, we hadn't realized it didn't have cheese till it came, but we still liked it)."}
{"text":"having never tried their williamson st. location, co-workers and i were happy to take a break from the office to check out the new restaurant in middleton.

when we walked in, the place was quite empty and we were immediately seated. after deciding that single slices were the way to go (getting six people to agree on toppings is no easy feat); we enjoyed jovial conversation... for a while. it felt like a long time to wait for pizza... the place started filling up, and the din increased, and finally! the waitress brought our cheese bread (basically a sauceless cheese pizza. talk about a profit-rendering food item!)

my spinach-feta stuffed slice was good. very feta-ey. i might have rather had a yummy slice of veggie pizza, but more than two toppings seemed expensive. the marinara sauce for the cheese bread was delicious. not too tangy, not to sweet... if it's what they use for their pizza sauce, then that's what will get me back there again to try an unstuffed slice.

over all, it was a good value for the dough, though they still seem to be getting their bearings at the second location; i'm assuming the lunch crowd on willy st is slightly less busy and time constrained than the one  in middleton."}
{"text":"Very good pizza for Madison! Real pizza, too, not that cracker-like crust that seems to be prevalent around here. Great toppings, fresh, good sauce, salad was also good, reasonable prices, excellent service."}
{"text":"Note: This is only a review on the delivery. 

Most chains deliver in about 30 minutes, but Roman Candle is upfront that it will take a little longer, and when you order online, it gives you an expected delivery time. My pizza was actually delivered before expected, I think within 45 minutes of ordering. I felt like there were a lot of pizza options and was impressed with their choice to use local and Wisconsin ingredients (which I have found is a very Madison thing to do). I ordered the Veggie Candle pizza and found it unique and enjoyed the spice. While it was spicy, it wasn't overwhelming and it was covered in artichokes and pepper, which complemented the sauce. On the downside, I agree with other comments on the crust. Nothing impressive, but there is a subtle sweetness to it. However, there doesn't appear to be a delivery minimum? I'll definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"Back when Roman Candle first opened on Willy Street, they made such lovely, fresh pizzas in a lucky Vespa Ciao kind of atmosphere. A slice of Pizza Margaritas and an Italian lemonade ... mwah!

This is what I thought Roman Candle in Middleton would be. Nope. It's just another cheap pizza place with meh service,  not-that-clean tables, and chintzy slices. 

Pizza is a rare treat for me so when I eat it, it needs to be good. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Once again this place disappoints... Currently the table tent offers three ice cream sandwiches... All of which are sold out!"}
{"text":"There was a yelp check in here offer for free breadsticks. Took more than an hour to get our breadsticks. Pizza took even longer. Really frustrating. Pizza was pretty good though. They did give us a discount on our order, but I don't really go out for Sunday night pizza expecting 2 hours in a half-full restaurant."}
{"text":"Food = 4 stars
Service = 1 star

We have eaten at Roman Candle dozens of times and it is consistent - good food, terrible service.  The convenience, and kid's play room in the basement are what keeps us coming back.  However, we are going to take a break for a while.  

A couple of weeks ago my wife called on a Tues or Weds to make a reservation in the basement for a group of ten (six adults, 4 kids) for the upcoming Friday.  \"No problem\" she is told.  They took the usual info - name and phone number.  We show up and they tell us they have no reservation and no room for us because a group of 25 has reserved the basement area.  Then they tell us there is no way we had a reservation because they always require a credit card when making a reservation.  Nice - they just called my wife a liar!  

I could go on and on about the bad service we have received at Roman Candle.  But I won't... I think my 2 star rating speaks volumes.

One more thing... Fix the damn bathroom in the basement!  It has been \"out of order\" for over a year."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, but our dine in experience was a definite Meh...  When we arrived there were only 3 - 4 tables but for some reason we were seated in the basement and wedged into a back corner?!?  Now, the upstairs is quite nice with several tables set in a well lit almost sun room like area and others that offer a view of the semi- open kitchen so the atmosphere of the dark basement with it's worn tile was way different.
We ordered two beers and 2 Rootbeer floats for the kiddos, and although the floats arrived quickly, it took the server 3 trips to the table, and after we'd ordered, to get the beers to us with a mumbled explanation of 'too much foam'.
The pizza was good, I have to say Glass Nickel is noticeably better, but this was still good pizza with a nice thin crust and fresh toppings with a really good sauce.
Overall, it wouldn't be my first choice for takeout or delivery and I would avoid the dine in experience all together."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town from Chicago for a race and were in need of pizza.  NEED.  This was our second pizza stop in Madison and while the first was good, Roman Candle takes the cake.  We ordered the Vegan Destroyer and promptly destroyed it in all its deliciousness.

Our server was awesome -- friendly and attentive without being intrusive, which is one of my pet peeves.  The owner also came over to talk to us and check in.  We also loved that they source locally as much as possible.  All in all this was a really rad place and we'll definitely be back to destroy more pizza pies the next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"Ordered the hot hawaii or whatever it's called. Spicy and delicious. The pizza itself was fantastic. 

My order of asparagus... not so much. For five pieces of aspargus (that had half the stalk cut off), I paid $5. Which really is WAY too expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"If I've learned one thing about Madison pizza, it's that the topic is a polarizing one. There's a lot of reviews here that note the uneven-at-best service. While I've definitely had some sitting and waiting in the dining room experience, their delivery has been uniformly pretty darn good. They're reasonably fast (I usually hear 45 mins to 1 hour on the phone and receive a pizza in about 30 minutes), bring a hot pizza, do cash or charge at the door, and - in the time or two when there have been questions about my order - they've called to ask rather than deliver something I didn't want.

Their thin-crust pizza is good, and they provide a ton of topping options from the mundane to the bizarre. Glass Nickel has a similar variety of toppings, but I can never get past the fact that their pizza tastes mostly like bread to me. Not so with Roman Candle. The toppings are fresh, their fancy ingredient choices are worth it (my husband adores the three kinds of P-P-Pepperoni), and I appreciate that they don't pulverize their pizza veggies. For instance, the green peppers on the animal lovers' pizza retain a bit of crunch. Love it. 

Perhaps expected with a wide variety of fresh local veggie toppings, their salads are top-notch, too. The spinach salad with strawberries, walnuts, and blue cheese is one of my faves in Madison.

A few things that leave me divided about whether this should be a 3-star or 4-star review: (+) They have lots of veggie and vegan options and are quite accommodating about substitutions and diet restrictions. (-) Their pizza is more than a little on the expensive side. Truly. (-) As such, I've been frustrated since they changed their policy on half-and-half pizzas: They used to happily make a half-and-half with two different specialty sets of toppings (my husband's an omnivore; I'm mostly-veggie), but no longer. But (+), I love that they stuck by their politics and supported the protestors by withdrawing from the Walker-supported restaurant board."}
{"text":"I think it's RIDICULOUS that I told the girl that I was sick in bed (from a consussion) and wanted to pay for the pizzas I ordered over the phone when it was delivered!  I have ordered pizzas there MANY TIMES for years and this ONE TIME BECAUSE I AM SICK I wanted to call in with the credit card when it got here! Oh well they can forget my business FOREVER!!!"}
{"text":"I eventually went back to redeem the bread sticks coupon (I stopped at Papa Murphy's for a pizza). 
Once again the bread sticks were dry and seemed slightly over-cooked, not soft and chewy like the lady on the phone said they were supposed to be. At least they remembered the marinara sauce. This time they twisted the bread sticks instead of leaving them flat. 
I won't be returning."}
{"text":"The pizza was mediocre, taste like old pizza that has been reheated in an oven that was not hot enough. The price is too high and the pizza simply doesn't meet the criteria for that cheesy gooey saucy deliciousness. I will pass from now on."}
{"text":"For healthyish parents and kids, college students with a better palate than most, and those who like local.

The waitstaff is attentive and ready to help.

I enjoy this place more than Ian's Pizza for the flavor, freshness, and clientele (read: no one is drunk). I like the idea of Roman Candle in that it gets ingredients from local places and gives a unique pizza-eating experience. I would recommend this place for a first date because it is cute, not so inexpensive (so still impressive), and has beer.

As for the best pizza in Madison, I would say no. Sometimes the pizza is rushed and the ingredients aren't \"all the way there\" in quality."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and the Middleton location is just as good as the Willy Street. Probably better, because the layout allows sound to be absorbed rather that echo into jet engine volume. I love the PPPepperoni and the Carnivore, but both have enough meat and cholesterol to jumpstart a heart attack. The house salad is great too, with bacon!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the idea of banana peppers on pizza.  On salads and sandwiches yes, I understand this concept but on pizza I don't.  We had the \"Roman Candle\" and the banana peppers were just way too overwhelming and so was the aftertaste.  My pilsner was great and the service was good.  I will go back because I definitely want to try their Margherita pizza.  I hope it's better than the RC.  As of now, the pepperoni and mushroom pizza at Natt Spil is still my favorite."}
{"text":"I wanted to give it a 3.8. Good service. Not too long to wait (and it was a busy friday). Pizza was good. Thin and greasy. Just the way I like it . Friendly staff. Has a play area downstairs for kids to play while you wait. Ran out of water while eating and she didn't refill until 10 min later. Also still waiting to get checked out. But I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place. It came very recommended. The reason I give it 3 stars is because I felt that I was overcharged for my pizza order. I asked for half-and half and was charged  extra for the ingredients.. Pizza itself was good."}
{"text":"Terrible service, however, the food made up for it the first time we tried Roman Candle.  We ordered online tonight and experienced the same terrible service when we picked up our order.  The woman lost our payment, then said they didn't make half the order.  She reassured us it they would make it in a short five minutes.  After the long wait, we get our order and it was incorrect and poor, frozen quality.  Unfortunately, we don't really recommend this."}
{"text":"The pizza here is nothing short of addicting. I can't wait to get back into Madison and feast!"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  I had the Veggie Candle (I think that is what it was called) and it was delicious.  Best pizza I've had in who knows how long.  Although it is pricier than other places, the quality of the food and the fact that it features local ingredients makes it totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and had a great experience both times. The pizza is delicious, cooked fresh, and served piping hot. It's also a great value price-wise. They make their own crusts and  their vegan pizzas are killer!

They also serve local beers, and an entire play room in the basement to keep kids occupied. 

5 stars for the great vegan pizza at the Roman Candle in Middleton."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at The Roman Candle again after a few months, and I must say that they have really stepped it up. Last time we ate here, we had the Algo Malo which, although has some unusual ingredients, was very delicious. We were excited to see that they had added a new pizza and some new toppings known as \"drizzles\". We tried the new \"hotwaii\" pizza and it was amazing! The pineapple-chipotle drizzle was the perfect blend of sweet and spicy. The Roman Candle is quickly becoming our new favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"We've dined here about half a dozen times, always in the restaurant, and it's been fine to good. Fresh salads, tasty pizza, decent service. So we keep going back, hence the 3 star review. Last night my husband brought home a pizza and a salad for the first time on his way home from work. The pizza was fine, same as when you eat in the dining room, but the salad was horrible-- completely rotten lettuce that would have made us sick if we'd tried to eat it. Glancing at the plastic clamshell box, it looked good-- fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, etc. But when I grabbed a pair of tongs and started to portion it out, the greens were total slime-- see my pic. What you see in the photo is just what I picked out from the top 1\" of the salad. If I had kept going, easily 25% of the greens were rotten like this. When I dumped it out in the garbage, there was a bunch of brown fluid in the bottom of the box-- the drainage from the rotten lettuces. Totally stomach-turning. I called to complain and the manager comped the $6 for the salad, which was fine and I really didn't care about the money, but that doesn't erase this experience and I'm going to have a hard time ordering from there for a while now. He told me that they get fresh greens every day. I find that hard to believe or maybe we got the leftovers from a previous day, but they were definitely not fresh last night."}
{"text":"I've don't eat frequently at Roman Candle, what with the closest being four miles away from my house, but I have stopped in at the Middleton location from time to time and have been blown away by the food. 
   The placement of this restaurant couldn't have been better. I read in a CapTimes article that Roman Candle has always had trouble delivering to the Dudgeon-Monroe area. 
   The decor is a little lacking. they have a giant wall that would be perfect for a mural, but they also have some cool structures over the tables in the back dining area, like your own little tent. Those are new. They have a small selection of games (shuffleboard, old-fashioned arcade), too.
   Of course, the food is simply amazing. It sticks out in an oversaturated market of cuisine here in Madison. Obviously, the pizzas are great, they have classics, build-your owns, stuff like that. But what they are really known for are their breadsticks. Those soft, herbed twists of bread pack a lot of addictive flavor. They also have a nifty name: Candlesticks. They have an ample selection of salads, too, a whole page in the menu worth.
     They use a lot of Wisconsin ingredients, which is good because I like to eat local. And they have a Chocolate Shoppe ice cream stand! 
   I have gotten delivery on multiple occasions. It is very fast and the pizza stays warm and tastes like it just came to your table in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza is some of the best around, easily beating out every other pizza joint in town. I would classify this in the \"pizza parlor\" sense, which is classy, nice ambiance, not too greasy, and has the right amount of Italian feel, as opposed to a \"pizza chain,\" which is so greasy that you could douse an empty cardboard box of said pizza from craptastic pizza chain in water and discern no difference from before. Bad pizza joints also have a limited menu, with few salads and *shudder* bad breadsticks (which is, of course, a mortal sin). Roman Candle fulfilled all of the \"pizza parlor\" requirements, with really good oregano breadsticks, amazing salad, especially for the price of said salad, at something like four dollars for a well-sized bowl of leaves with creamy dressing, and of course, a huge selection of pizza. They give you a choice of sauce, and have almost fifteen toppings (not that anyone's counting or anything). Also, they have wine, which I found a little surprising. A good surprising, but a surprising nonetheless. I mean, it is a pizza place after all. 
There is a bottom floor with a playpen for the little kids, so that was mostly a family zone. The service was really good, our server came and checked on us about three-quarters through our meal, which was a little late, but it was extremely busy on a Friday night, so I don't blame her. She was really courteous, asking if anyone needed any refills, take-out boxes, things like that. 
The best thing about Roman Candle? The pizza of course, but I love the ambiance, really cozy even though it's a very open place. 
And imagine my elation when I found out that Roman Candle is adding a location near my house! Let's hope it's as frenfillaboulos as this one."}
{"text":"Great pizza menu. We had all run a half marathon earlier in the day and wanted food. Chose here because we didn't want PizzaHut or Dominoes. So worth it. All four of us got different pizzas and loved them. The pesto one was so delicious with feta."}
{"text":"People in Madison are suckers for buzzwords like, \"Local,\" \"Organic,\" \"Sustainable,\" and \"Environmentally Friendly.\" Unfortunately, these words don't add up to a great product. When I want to eat, I am eating for taste and for the overall general satisfaction one has when enjoying a meal. Unfortunately, these buzzwords don't necessarily insure a better meal, because in the end I am eating food, not a concept. Their pizza's are okay and a nice alternative to Glass Nickel's doughy pizzas, but their appetizers (the breadsticks and the philo dough stuffed blue cheese/shallots) left so much more to be desired - but such is the dining environment in Madison... where people will overlook mediocre quality and embrace an establishment because it only really feeds the customer's sense of altruism, masking the fact that the product isn't really anything spectacular."}
{"text":"The customer service here is awful. Ordered a pizza for pick up, guy on the phone said it would be half an hour. Upon arrival to pick up our pizza - forty minutes after our order had been placed - they told us they thought we had ordered delivery, but our pizza would be out in \"one\" minute... another THIRTY minutes passed and our pizza was finally ready. Obviously they didn't start our pizza until we had arrived. Nothing was said to us throughout our wait at the restaurant,  and we were given our pizza along with a fake apology for the wait and nothing else was offered... 

Roman Candle pizza, if you want to successfully run a business, get your customer service issues worked out... 

PS. the pizza deserves a 3 stars rating - bad service absolutely ruins a customers experience at a restaurant. Looking for pizza in Madison? Please go elsewhere. These people don't deserve your money."}
{"text":"Ok, maybe I was too harsh in my last review. After hearing the company had pulled out of the restaurant association in protest of it's support for Walker I thought I should try them again, and I'm glad I did. 

The cheesesticks were amazing again and the Animal Lovers pizza we had was perfect. Fresh ingredients, fresh cheese, perfectly based crust, the whole nine yards. Maybe they were just on a bad streak last time.

Sorry, Roman Candle, please forgive me. I can be quick to judge when pizza is concerned, I don't take disappointment very well.

And bravo for standing up for what you believe in."}
{"text":"Super casual, super affordable and really delicious pizza? Sign me up! This location evokes a little nostalgia for an old-school pizza parlor with its 80s video games for a quarter and an all-ages vibe. It's kid-friendly without being annoying and there is a bar that has some really nice cocktails as well as wine beer. The pizza is the star of the menu, with quality ingredients and lots of options but they also have chicken wings, soup, salads and a couple pasta dishes. They serve all day so lunch can be any time, till 3 p.m. Their happy hour starts at 4 p.m., so we missed it by an hour. I don't know what they do to the pizza crust but it was perfect. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Middleton. 
Unfortunately. 
It's good. I just wish it were great."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite pizza place. We walked in with a hungry one year old and had breadsticks just for her at the table within minutes. They also knew we were on a time crunch and made sure we were in and out.
The atmosphere is very laid back, wait staff is ready with recommendations if you need them, and super responsive to whatever you need.
The real star here is the pizza. We ordered the Triple P, and guys, if mouths could orgasm...
It tastes exactly how you want local pizzaria pizza to taste?, with that cheese for days, homemade pepperoni deliciousness."}
{"text":"As a Chicago girl, I know a thing or two about pizza.  While Roman Candle does some things well, I had a few issues.

First, the delivery was fast, free and the delivery guy was super nice and professional.  The pizza crust was a good balance between ultra thin crust and deep dish.  They don't go too crazy on the toppings and the menu gives tons of options for specialty pizzas.

However... the pizzas arrived, how shall I say... less than hot?  Kinda luke warm.  And just so you know, when you microwave wood fired pizzas, they lose their magic.  Also, Roman Candle is on the pricey side.  $31 (plus tip!) for two medium pizzas seemed a bit excessive.

Perhaps next time I'm in the area I'll try dining in."}
{"text":"Love the unique pizzas!  Being the first time, we had to try the Roman Candle.  It was delicious, but I wouldn't have minded a little extra kick.  

A bonus for parents with young children:  they have toys for little ones to play with and entertain themselves with!

So glad we finally tried this place out!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best casual pizza option around. I don't even see the comparison to Glass Nickel, but maybe I've just had bad experiences there, food and service-wise. 

You can't go wrong with the Roman Candle menu item itself -- great pizza! The vibe is chill Willy St and the service is more quirky than anything, though I guess I can see how people have had bad experiences. (Sometimes they take away my fork after the appetizer.) Just be proactive if your server does something silly or you need their attention. It's part of the charm. I love the place, so I'm more willing to be forgiving, I guess. Keep that good pizza coming."}
{"text":"This is among the best pizzas available in Madison.  Only Pizza Brutta is better*, and that's sort of a different experience anyway.  Glass Nickel is also good, but it's a thicker, more filling (and less elegant) pizza.

The crust is nice and thin, the ingredients seem to be of good quality, and the flavor is good.  The pizzas are normal size, but because of the thin crust, it's pretty easy for two people to eat a whole pizza in one sitting, without feeling bloated and sluggish afterwards.  We rarely have leftovers from Roman Candle, which is probably good, since it doesn't re-heat as well as some other pizzas.  (It's not inedible or anything, just not nearly as good as when it was fresh.)

It can take some time to find decent parking - we usually have to go a block to the west and park on the street with the bike trail - but nothing too onerous.

The store is pleasant enough - bright, with lots of windows for people-watching; magazines to read; and it's kept clean.


* Our absolute favorite non-Brutta pizza in WI is Sal's pizza in Milwaukee.  That store is apparently owned by relatives of the owners of the late, great Casa Bianca, may it rest in peace."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent!  I ordered the Vegan Destroyer and it was extremely flavorful. I had ordered online earlier in the day for a 6:30pm pick-up. I still had to wait 10 minutes for my pizza to come out.  It was a busy evening and I guess I should not be annoyed about a wait for a freshly prepared pizza, but it would have been nice to have it ready when I requested."}
{"text":"Sprechers Rootbeer on draft + pizza + spinach salad. Order it. Eat it. Love me.

As others have said the dine-in experience is not really a good one.

That being said if you are looking for an inexpensive piece of good thin crust pizza eat here. I have been several times, the service isn't great, but the portions are huge and the food comes out fresh. Lunch combo is an amazing steal."}
{"text":"The Roman Candle is a unique place with reasonable prices. Easily one of the best pizza places I've ever been to. It even has a pleasant atmosphere.

The order: two salads (spinach and house garden salad), a four-topping small pizza (red pepper, mushroom, pepperoni and pineapple chipotle drizzle), and tiramisu. It totaled to just $30, and the pizza was more than enough for two people. Salads were delicious and full of flavor. Not sure what these guys are complaining about.

Also, our server was top-notch. She even gave us directions around Middleton.
If you're all at interested in this place, and pizza is your thing, go for it. 
You might find that it's your new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Roman Candle Pizzeria has quickly become my favorite pizza place in Middleton.  Granted, there isn't a whole lot of competition in the area.  Regardless, Roman Candle consistently serves an excellent thin crust pizza and has a good tap selection.  I've never had a bad experience here, and I've never been to the Willy Street location so I can't compare.  The prices are a slightly high compared to other Middleton places but fair for what they offer, though I bet a made-to-order pizza could start to get pricey.  Overall it is a strong four star place, with only a few drawbacks.

I tend to always go with one of the specialties as I don't usually care to take the time to argue about the toppings on a made-to-order pie.  The specialties at Roman Candle are all good.  My personal favorite is the Professional, though had you told me that I'd really enjoy broccoli on a pizza a few years ago I'd never have believed it.  The jalepenos combine with the creamy alfredo sauce exceedingly well, and if it weren't for a desire to try the others I probably wouldn't have ever ordered anything else.  The signature Roman Candle pizza is another one of my favorites - I apparently love the spicy pizzas.  My last time there we went with the Pestoral.  At first I thought that it was a bit much, since a little pesto can go a long way for my taste.  However, by the second slice I was really enjoying it.  It was the kind of pizza that only works for me on crispy thin crust, which was perfect in balancing out the melted feta and mozzarella and the olive oil.  Also, the little fold-down trays for the pizza are really a brilliant idea.  I haven't ever tried the pasta here, but it is all RP's and on that alone I can recommend it.  Also, the appetizers here are all tasty.  The deluxe cheese breadsticks with marinara are a meal in itself, and the garlic bread with spinach and cheese is a standard.  I also want to try the shallot and bleu cheese filo wraps one of these times.  The tap selection changes from time to time, but there always seems to be a couple Lake Louies and of course Capital.

The drawbacks to the place are that service can be pretty slow, though the waitstaff always is apologetic about it.  I've never stopped for lunch, but a friend that works in the area has always said that it is quite busy.  The booths can be a bit uncomfortable, as they have hard backs.  Sometimes the young children can get a bit out of control, and the place can get a bit loud.  These are all fairly minor issues, and are all pretty common for downtown Middleton.  I haven't gotten delivery from this location so I don't know how fast it is, but it is free for orders over $12."}
{"text":"Good pizza horrible service. Tried to give the restaurant a second chance and had another horrible experience. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since moving from the East Coast.  My personal favorite is the Roman Candle, but I swap jalapenos for the sausage.  Love the Firecracker sauce!  I love the opportunity to make my own pizzas - or at least tell other people how to make them for me!  The gorgonzola salad was great, but I don't recommend the bleu cheese puff pastry appetizers - very oily and without any zing.  Good beer and wine selection (for it being a pizza place) and Chocolate Shoppe is the only kind of chocolate ice cream I eat."}
{"text":"I have had Roman Candle a total of 3 times in my life. The first was around 2007, I went into the Willy st. shop with a friend and got a 'make your own' slice. It wasn't anything special, and I hadn't gone back until a few weeks ago (8 years later). 
I ordered the Vegan Destroyer pizza with the fireworks sauce (you choose between that, and the regular sauce for this particular pizza), and it was delicious! Mounds of greens on top, great sauce, but for some reason wasn't spicy like the menu had stated that the fireworks sauce was. Still, I loved it. 
Yesterday, my boyfriend and I ordered the same pizza, but in a bigger size for the both of us. There were no greens piled on top as before, but there was everything else that the menu stated. This time it was also SUPER spicy, which I love, but my boyfriend doesn't quite have the palate for. I thought, since the first time I got it, it wasn't burning my mouth at all, that it would be the same and that he wouldn't mind. 
He still ate it, and it was good, but I essentially got 2 different pizzas each time. I'm not sure if they didn't put the fireworks sauce on my first one, or if this batch was just super spicy. Either way, I'll probably just stick to my regular pizza spots."}
{"text":"The Roman Candle is my favorite casual-Italian place in Madison.  The pizza is better than most in Madison, but it's the pasta and the lunch specials that make this place really shine for me.  My current favorite is their lasagna, and prior to that, it was their now-discontinued pesto lasagna, which was incredible.  Unfortunately their pasta selection is small, but what they do have is worth getting.

The pizza is, by my reckoning, better than any of the big-name delivery places in Madison (Falbo's, Figaro's, Glass Nickel, etc.).  It's the only one that I'd consider good as a non-native Wisconsonite.  Cooking time has always been reasonable when I've had one (always eat-in), and they've all been tasty.  The Vegan Destroyer is worth a call-out; it was highly satisfactory to both my vegan sister and me, and I'm not even vegetarian.

The lunch specials are $7.99 on weekdays for a choice of two among a pasta, a slice of pizza (you get a big slice with these), a salad, or their red pepper soup, plus a fountain drink.  I'm not a salad person, but they have some pretty good salads, and the red pepper soup is fantastic.  Pretty reasonable, and fairly quick too.

In my experience, the service, while not perfect, is usually pretty decent (I usually eat at the Middleton one, less often Fitchburg).  The only issue I've had is when one pizza came out slightly burned.  They admitted it, made another one, and that one came out just right.  I can't remember anymore if they adjusted the bill or anything because of it, but I figure they're close to average in that sort of thing for the number of times I've visited."}
{"text":"I love any place where I can switch away from the standard red sauce, so seeing the pesto and alfredo options - as well as the very best idea of combining the two was exciting .

Our pizza was delicious, the service was good and the prices are reasonable. We have friends that make a trip here a part of their Madison visit routine and I could see why."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday, we decided that we would go back to the Roman Candle Pizzeria in Middleton, WI after not having eaten there for a few months.  I'm saddened to report that it was a bad decision to return to this location... since they have really gone down hill.  Our total experience was as if we were eating in a \"third world country\" establishment.  The restaurant was literally filthy with disgusting food stains covering some of the walls.  The booths are falling apart with half of the booths having been replaced with uncomfortable wooden chairs.  Our booth was worn out with a huge rip in the seat upholstery.  The salads were less than fresh and the thin crust pizza was actually half baked with raw onion, raw crust and raw green pepper.  This location has deteriorated dramatically in the last several months and our overall visit was very disappointing to put it mildly.  The only thing worth eating or drinking was the bottle of Chardonnay wine.  I am not sure how this restaurant can stay in business much longer.  Clearly a change in management and financial infusion is in order to get the place back in shape."}
{"text":"I would've given 5 stars if I didn't have to squeeze into a booth with new cushioning so high that I couldn't touch the floor with my feet nor the table with my elbows (I'm 5'6\"). Plus the prices are a bit high. $14 for a 2 topping small (including tax)! But like I said, I would've given 5 stars (rare for me) because:

1. Service was friendly and attentive (both the waitress and the cook) 
2. Pizza is addictive
3. Build your own pizzas with yummy sauce drizzle options (try the pineapple chipotle!) 
4. Lower level with a play area for kids
5. Reasonable prices

I now work very near this location and my waist line is in serious trouble. Shoot. 

I hope I get some good discounts now that I signed up for the emails."}
{"text":"Everything Roman Candle makes is delicious! 

Our favorites are the Hot-Wa-ii pizza or any of them with Fireworks sauce. They pack heat!

We get delivery at the location on Willy St. We have sat in for date nights before too. They have an intimate seating area inside, and in the summer outside too. Makes for a nice casual pizza and beer date :). 

Good happy hour specials also!"}
{"text":"We've always been huge fans of Roman Candle pizza in Middleton so we were excited to see them open a place in our neighborhood!    Now we are only a short walk to their fabulous housemade roasted red pepper soup, a great pizza, and some Chocolate Shoppe ice cream for dessert (yes, it is right inside the restaurant!)  The Monroe Street location has a different vibe than their other places.  They successfully pull off having a fresh, modern, casual cocktail bar type design yet still very family friendly - especially in the back.  Looks like they will have outdoor seating in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been going to Roman Candle since it opened and may have helped them stay in business the first year.

They excel at custom large slices of pizza and topping combos- I particularly like the Veggie Candle with spicy sauce and banana peppers.  For plain Cheese I'd rather have Sal's on Johnson, but this is my favorite for loading on veggies. My vegan friends prefer their vegan pizza to others' (Glass Nickel comes to mind).  

To the person who found a \"nose ring\" in their mac and cheese, that's a sauce bag closure. Not something that should remain in the food but, Jesus Christ, the histrionic photos and statement that someone with a nose ring is \"allowed to still work there\" because you essentially got a twist-tie in the food (with an apology) is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Driving by and tried it for lunch.  The staff tried hard to accommodate me because I was in a hurry and illegally parked outside.  Pizza was pretty good and service excellent."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I've found in Madison so far, and probably the best pizza I've had without a brick pizza oven.  I love the quality, local ingredients that they use and the service is always friendly.  This is my go-to pizza place in town."}
{"text":"After a long, long day of traveling  I made the mistake of stumbling into this place hoping to get a slice of pizza. It wasn't an unreasonable expectation, since their name is Roman Candle PIZZA. I ordered, mentioned that I really couldn't wait long (and was assured it'd be two minutes) and made the mistake of paying and tipping first.  Mea culpa. I then waited and waited as a hapless bunch of employees sat around joking with each other, and an even more hapless girl worked in the kitchen. As it turns out I gave up. When I finally checked how the unfortunate slice was coming along, I was told \"she pushed the wrong button\" and she hadn't even started making it. I walked out and let them keep the money, too tired to make a fuss.  It's not the clueless employees' fault of course; someone allegedly manages that place, and with the contempt they show for the customer experience, next time you're hungry I suggest you pick up a frozen pizza at a gas station rather than going to Roman Candle in Middleton. At least at your own microwave chances are you'll push the right button."}
{"text":"Interesting decor (looks a little run down or retro, but on purpose) and clearly fun for the kids.  Good variety of food selection.  Had the \"supreme\" with veggies and meats.  It was pretty good and satisfying.  Wait staff was amazingly friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good, the ingredients are fresh! The pizza has a thin non-greasy crust that reminds me a lot of a pizza place I used to love in college. 
My only complain is that I've been here twice and had my order screwed up both times. 
They get an A+ for being apologetic and for making it right and quickly but it'd be so much better if the pizza came out right the first time, I will be back again and am hoping the 3rd time is a charm!"}
{"text":"Our pizza of choice in Madison, which has many fine pizza choices. We go here quite often and also order delivery. Love the garlic bread and we always get the P-P-Pepperoni pizza - three different kinds of pepperoni and it is perfection. Love eating in as well - can get kind of crowded but the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"I love this place!  My husband and I frequent RC because it is in our 'hood.  Their pizza combos are fantastic, we especially like the Algo Malgo.  The tap beer is rotating and good selections.  It is also just a fun, cozy environment, we love hanging out here on Friday nights or in the evening after work."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent -- if you can overcome poor customer service to actually place an order. This is the third or fourth time we've experienced poor customer service at Roman Candle. It doesn't seem to be an understaffing problem, for which I have a lot of sympathy since that's not the servers' fault. On our last visit, we requested menus and four glasses of water to start. The waitress delivered two glasses of water, said she'd be right back with the other two, and never returned in the next 20-25 minutes. During that time, she and another waitress were busing unneeded tables (the restaurant was more than half empty, so this doesn't seem like it should have taken priority over interacting with customers). We attempted multiple times to get her attention to place an order, but finally gave up after 20+ minutes of waiting and left."}
{"text":"This review is of the Roman Candle's excellent bartending service at my recent wedding reception at the Children's Museum.

Cameron and Alejandra were absolutely GREAT to work with. They knew that there were restraints on what they could offer set in place by the venue and were sure to communicate this with me up front. Any time there was a concern or question, I was contacted.

The day-of service was nothing short of amazing. The bartenders were not only friendly but fun! I enjoyed chatting with them and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. Even thought we totally over-ordered on beer, they did try to arrange a way for us to use it (sadly, we were leaving on our honeymoon the next day, so it didn't get used *sob*sob*). 

Great service, great people, and decently reasonable catered bar charges (which are always silly pricey no matter where you go). I heart you all, Roman Candle. You're aces."}
{"text":"I gave this place another shot, and I'm so glad I did. First, the smell that I previously mentioned...was gone from the little pizza parlor.  Secondly, I had a pizza this time!
Our group first started with the roasted broccoli and parmesan plate, which was super fantastic. For our meal we got the Algo Malo pizza. Which reading what was on the pizza and seeing it had beets on it, It was a little off putting for me. But it took us probably 15 minutes to decided on a pizza, so I figured I'd give it a chance.

I was not disappointed, I couldn't really tell that the beets were on there, so it worked for me.  Plus I had a puddle of sriracha on my pizza slice that I'm sure helped mask the taste of them. Our server (same as last time) was great, she helped us decided on a pizza, and suggested the one that we got and said it was a favorite among other customers. She was very attentive for being the only server in the busy restaurant with people coming in out for to-go orders, phones ringing off the hook, and them only down to one stove. 

The service, and the pizza really make this place awesome. Just be aware that you will be spending quite a bit on a pie as ours was about $23.00, but you definitely get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"I have heard so many good things about the Roman Candle, so I finally decided to go outside my comfort zone and try a new pizza. I ordered the veggie animal lover supreme, and I wasn't really that impressed. While the service was fine and the delivery was fast, the pizza itself failed to deliver. It wasn't that bad, but it definitely was not good by any objective standard.

The sauce is interesting, and has a strong sweet flavor, but it really just didn't work for this particular pizza. I don't like the taste of sugar mixing with my veggies. However, the veggies themselves were nothing to brag about either. They were undercooked, leading to fried onions that weren't caramelized and all other kinds of soggy crap. This is due mostly to the fact that the vegetables had become saturated in the grease from the mozzarella cheese. Any idiot who makes pizzas for a living should have anticipated this happening when you're using fresh cheese. They could have thrown the veggies on halfway through cooking, and/or cooked them separately. Instead, they clearly cut corners, and I'm left with shit. They also put an obscene amount of basil leaf on the pizza, which fortunately was not as soggy because most of it burnt up into a flaky black powder. Who would have thought that a dry leaf can't withstand 30 minutes in a 400-degree oven, right?

The cheese was great, and it's such a shame that it had to come out the way it did. Aside from destroying every topping it touched, it wasn't melted enough. They're clearly using fresh mozzarella - the kind that comes in a ball floating in water/oil. But they don't know what to do with it. You can't just slap a bunch of that shit on a pizza crust and call it a night. It's disappointing because their pizzas could be so much better if they had a staff that actually knows how to make them.

Speaking of the crust...the crust just infuriated me. I love crust. I will eat leftover pizza crusts when I don't even know where they came from. It is no doubt the best part of the pizza. And yet on this pizza, I fucking threw them out. Unbelievable. Even dipping them in ranch couldn't save them. The crust - in fact, the entire dough part of the pizza - was dry, burnt, floppy, and tasteless. It was too thin to support the pizza and had the consistency of a shredded tire. Yeah, their dough may be home-made. But home-made doesn't mean anything if you don't know how to make it in the first place.

My girl hates pizza, and the one time we actually agree to order a pizza, I get this unacceptably bad pizza. Thanks, Roman Candle, now I won't be eating another pizza for a long time. I suppose it's my fault for thinking I should try something different from Glass Nickel for a change."}
{"text":"We had a coupon so decided to try out The Roman Candle Pizzeria. Upon entering we were told to sit where ever we wanted. The booths on the sides all have little table-tops which pull down from the walls to put the pizzas on over the tables themselves. For the center tables, they bring out stands to put the pizzas on. Our waiter promptly came by w/menus and asked for our drink order. We asked for a couple of minutes to peruse the menu and that began the rather slow response time.

When our server did return we ordered beers, salads and pizza. There weren't a lot of patrons there when we arrived but it continued to get busier the longer we were there. Our beers arrived and eventually our salads. The side salads were very tasty, with just the right amount of dressing. Eventually the pizza arrived and it was top-notch. Thin, crispy crust; tasty sauce; plentiful and yummy toppings. We wondered if they made the sausage themselves, it had an excellent fennel flavor. The pizza was easily some of the best we've had in Madison.

I'd certainly give the Roman Candle Pizzeria another chance on the merits of their food. Hopefully the speed of the service and delivery of the food will improve."}
{"text":"Okay, I confess. I am a Roman Candle junkie. Partly because it's only half a block away from my apartment. But there are lots of restaurants close by. I keep coming back because the food is consistently delicious and the staff is so friendly every time I stop in for my takeout. I highly recommend the Greek pizza - savory with the addition of the feta cheese and slightly charred fresh spinach leaves. You may think a Greek pizza should have black olives but trust me, the green olives add a brightness you wouldn't believe. I've also had the Pestoral - similar to the Greek but not quite as good in my opinion. My attempt at healthier fare is to order a large House Salad (sans the bacon for me). It's a lovely variety of fresh greens with cucumbers and surprisingly tasty cherry tomatoes even in the wintertime. Topped with lots of blue cheese and the tangy house balsamic, I'm as pleased with a salad as I would be with pizza. But it's so easy to forget about health food with an order of Deluxe Candle Sticks for an accompaniment. It's pizza dough topped with garlic butter in place of sauce, then covered in a thick coat of cheese - yum! They top the deluxe version with sliced tomatoes, spinach and even more garlic. Where do they find these tomatoes?!? Be sure to order extra marinara for dipping. One more temptation - Chocolate Shoppe ice cream! This is not a place for diet food. You can do that tomorrow."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was some of the worst service I've ever had at a local restaurant:

-Our waitress got my drink order wrong twice, never brought my companion's drink, brought the wrong kids meal, and was surly each time she approached our table - which wasn't often. 

-The restaurant was practically empty, yet it took 40 minutes for our food to arrive. 

-Neither the waitress nor any other staff member ever stopped by to let us know what was going on or apologize for the delay, though we had hungry toddlers waiting. 

-When we arrived, they told us they don't seat people downstairs in the daytime, yet a group came in half an hour later and was seated downstairs - and received their food before we did!

-They tried to argue with me when (after 40 minutes) I told them to cancel my daughter's order, box whatever food was ready, and bring the check. 

-When I arrived home with my food, I found that the $7 appetizer I bought consisted of three tiny pieces and a clump of greens - for twice the cost of a slice of their mediocre, dry pizza.

For being billed as a \"family\" pizza place, they were anything but family-friendly. The food is of poor to middling quality at a premiere price tag. I will never visit this restaurant again, and would not recommend it to anyone I know. 

If you need a replacement venue, Cafe Porta Alba offers a far superior pizza experience for both foodies and their families."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is a joke. I take that back because it is not even funny... I work down the street and often come here for lunch with co-workers. They can never seat us together. The sad part is they have a large table on the lower floor but that section is all ways closed. I asked \"why\" on this visit and our waitress said it wasn't cleaned from the weekend. Mind you it was Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Super tasty pizza. Vegan options. Friendly staff. Good vibe. They have more than one location."}
{"text":"I've brought groups of people here a few times and I always leave with the feeling that I could have picked a better place to go for a pizza. It does have it's positives, but I find that pizza isn't really one of them.

Positives:
- The Sprecher here is on tap and always rocks.
 - Their French press coffee is awesome.
 - Their cheesy breadsticks (candlesticks) have never let me down.
 - The atmosphere here is also amazing. Relaxing, not very crowded, and typically playing Franz Ferdinand or Death Cab for Cutie in the background.
 - Good service and friendly wait staff.

Negatives:
 - Surprisingly bland pizza every time I've been here.
 - Curdled coffee cream. Turned a good French press coffee into cottage cheese.
 - Humus was extremely bland. Came from a tub by way of ice cream scoop.
 - Lasagna was really bland as well.

Not a bad place to hang out and have a glass of Sprecher root beer, but I'd rather drive another five minutes to Porta Alba, Ian's, Novanta, Glass Nickel, or Buck's and get a better pizza."}
{"text":"The customer service/delivery service in my experience was nothing less than amazing.  I'll preface my review and be upfront that I might be somewhat biased. You see they delivered me food to Agrace Hospice while I stayed with my Dad 24/7 in his room for 3 weeks at the end of his life. And they not only delivered it to the center but right to his room for me. The food options were limited and I had flown in from out of town and had no car. I was so very appreciative of their willingness to do that so I didn't have to leave my dad's side.

That being said they were always polite and efficient. The delivery was timely and sometimes close to when they closed. I ordered a variety of items. Pizza, pasta, salads and so forth as I ordered from them probably about 10+ times in 21 days. The pizza and salads were my favorite.  The pizza reheated well as did the pastas. The grilled chicken Cesar salad was a little on the smallish size for the price. Otherwise I found the prices to be pretty fair. 

If in the area again and wanting pizza I'd definitely go back and have some pizza here!!"}
{"text":"After hearing wonderful things, my husband and I tried Roman Candle on Willy Street for the first time this evening. We both loved the thin crust and fresh ingredients. We ordered breadsticks to start. They were good, but the real star was the delicious marinara dipping sauce. We got the margarita pizza with artisan pepperoni. Delicious! Also loved the San Pellegrino on the menu. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the animal lovers pizza here. Not terribly impressed. Crust was not terribly crispy. We were one of only a couple of groups in the restaurant but service was still pretty slow. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Imagine ordering a couple pizzas to go after the kids soccer games at half time; and then arriving with the hungry kids and your out of town guests and the pizzas are not ready.  Ok so you wait.  And are ignored.  Finally the pizzas arrive; and once you pull on to the freeway - they call you to return the same sorry pizzas.  And when you do oblige them - they try to hand those pizzas to other customer but they are wrong and so decide to remake the other customers order( before they start your order.  Then after waiting again, kids in the car the surly help slams your meal down.  Are you kidding me you amateurs?"}
{"text":"Delicious as usual! I was recentlyish diagnosed as unable to eat gluten, and have been craving pizza ever since. Glass Nickel's gluten-free crust disappointed me, so I was hesitant to try Roman Candle's.

I am THRILLED to report that I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was delicious, the crust was crispy and flavorful. I didn't feel \"left out\" or like I was \"settling\" at all."}
{"text":"Cool place in Madison!  Great pizza and beer selection.  Cool, neighborhood vibe to this place too with friendly service."}
{"text":"I usually order the pizza for delivery, and I'm surprised by the comments about poor customer service. I can, however, tell you that the delivery staff is always very nice. Perhaps the nicest delivery drivers I've ever dealt with. I've also never encountered any issues with the website or delivery of my pizzas. If they say it'll be an hour, it's about an hour.

The ingredients seems to be of a very high quality. We often get a Big Boom, which is a build-your-own option. The chicken is really tasty, and as I mentioned, seems to be good quality. No mystery meat here. The pizzas just always taste really great.

I have ordered quite a few pizzas from the Willy location, and have dined at a couple of their restaurants and have always had a great experience. Some of my favorite pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Roman Candle has delicious pizza in a nice casual atmosphere. Many other pizza spots would get a 4 from me, but Roman candle hands down gets a 5. Picked up a pizza near closing, staff was getting ready to leave- they were very fun and welcoming. They didn't have the right beer glass for a beer I ordered so they gave me 2. We also had an impromptu dance party , how can you even beat that?!"}
{"text":"Used to decent, but they literally can't deliver.  LAst three orders: #1. Lost the order.  Waited two hours, called and they had no clue.  #2.  Sent out our pizza somewhere else, called us and told us, pizza arrived two hours later.  #3.  Ordered pizza with a guy who sounded stoned, didn't know specials and repeated our our order several times.  Got a call back that they were out of some of the ingredients for our pizza.  We just cancelled.  Three strikes you're OUT Roman Candle.  Too much competition to bother with you."}
{"text":"It was my second time coming here while visiting the boyfriend's family in Wisconsin.  Both times we came as a large group, including 2 young children, so this is probably why service was pretty bad.  Quite slow and unattentive.  

I enjoyed the speciality pizza choices, and my Margharita with extra basil was good.  Everyone else liked theirs as well, and the house/garden salad looked delicious.  

The restaurant itself is set up on 3 pseudo levels.  The main entrance has several booths and the kitchen, down a couple stairs are a couple tables, and the lower level has more tables, a play area for kids, and bathrooms.  The evening we were there, 2 musicians played Christmas music, which was nice but made the main entrance a little crowded.

Overall, I'd love to come back with a smaller group - I'm guessing the service would improve."}
{"text":"Really fun environment, great wisconsin beers on tap... And you must try the Roman candle pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"Just had the worst pizza of my life. It was all sauce, barely any cheese and overall a big disappointment. Called the manager; she told me that Margherita pizzas are usually not recommended for delivery or pickup. Hmm..never heard that one before and I wasn't made aware of this when I placed the order. . She offered no refund or replacement. I said nothing, I just wanted them to know because it was like having bread and sauce. Any good restaurant would offer some sort of compensation. I could have asked for one, I didn't call for that but it says a lot about them. We've liked their food in the past so this was interesting."}
{"text":"Pestoral... one of the best veggie pizzas in town.  Good price for non-chain pizza place."}
{"text":"Listen....full props that this place has some of the best pizza I have ever had.  The Roman Candle and the BBQ chicken pizza are awesome.  That being said I am not sure if there is a lack of managing the servers or if they aren't trained, but there has never been a time where our order has been correct or that the server came back until the end of the meal.  I have seen our server at the front sitting people and in the back and then waiting tables.  Manage your staff better and three stars will be five."}
{"text":"I truly enjoy this place, nice atmosphere, great beer, many, many different pizza topping choices. We had the Veggie Animal pizza and it was excellent."}
{"text":"The pizza was great.  However, my husband's salad had WAY too much Italian dressing on it.  There was a pool of it at the bottom of the bowl.  Prices are a little high.  Customer Service was fine...just was surprised she couldn't tell me how much just a slice of pizza would be.  If it varies, give me a range or ask me what kind we were interested in.  We went with a whole pizza.  

The booths are horrible.  They lean back so if you are short, your feet don't touch the ground and you are touching the person across the booth from you.  Not comfortable at all!"}
{"text":"I meant to review after the first time we tried this pizza - a few weeks back - but this weekend we tried again! Very tasty and good pizza. The sausage is our favorite though - great flavor and taste! First time through we tried the \"Roman Candle\" pizza with the spicy sauce and the banana peppers. My wife loved it but I thought it was a bit hot overload. I liked the peppers - but with the spicy sauce I thought it was a bit much. Second time thru we had cheese sausage and mushroom. Very yummy and a good value. 

We dined in the first time and it was a fun cozy atmosphere. Service was good and friendly - only problem was my soda tasted funny, but they replaced it without question. Second time we called in a order and picked up. The wait was a bit excessive since I called before driving down and we don't live that close. Should have been done when we arrived - and it took another 10 -15 minutes. It was the weekend though and they were busy. 

Overall, very good pizza. . . and a nice change of pace if you are sick of the same-old-same-old."}
{"text":"I ate there on a Friday night and we had to wait more than 45 minutes for our pizzas.  The pizzas are great, but their Spinach salad (get it with beets) is outstanding.  The bottom line is that they use good ingredients so the food is good, but don't expect to get in and get out within an hour on a weekend."}
{"text":"Our company ordered pizzas for a luncheon and somehow the order got messed up, and didn't get made.  Not showing, rose a flag. I do not know fine details of how that happened, however, the response is what I am happily letting others no of. 

I have to say, due to this issue, they responded amazingly!  Extra pizza on our order with no charge, they added in 8 pints Chocolate Shoppe ice cream, and we ordered none.  Amazing customer service response!  Well done, thank you!"}
{"text":"Roman Candle has amazingly quality ingredients and always work hard to take care of gluten free guests like me. Their red sauce can't be beat!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out last night and were very impressed! 

For three hungry adults, we ordered a pitcher of beer, a 12in Margherita, and a 12in Professional. We all left happy and full!

The bar had a great selection of craft brews that recently switched over. And, although I haven't yet tried one, the homemade cocktails sounded amazing. 

The atmosphere is welcoming and vibrant. I highly recommend this place as a go-to for pizza!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! Stopped in for 'za and a beer. Divided in two rooms, the bar area and the dining room, I liked the bar area for less kiddos/families. There's also a couple arcade games in between rooms. They've got a nice rotation of Wisconsin craft beers, and keep the board above the bar current! My server was excellent, and let me try a beer I wasn't familiar with. It didn't turn out to my liking, so I went with the excellent Karben4 Fantasy Factory IPA. 

I ordered the Animal Lovers vegetarian pizza on thin crust, and it was great. Lots of fresh veggies, and very tasty. It was delivered quickly to my table, which was really appreciated! My server was excellent, but it seemed like there were way too many servers standing around, and a few just didn't seem that motivated to be at work (so I can see how some other reviewers' calls of bad service might have credence). My server checked in frequently, and I was in and out of there in a flash, which was nice!"}
{"text":"Pizza here is definitely really delicious but it's expensive and delivery usually takes a long time. I go Glass Nickel over Roman Candle these days even tho I live a block away from RC."}
{"text":"Like others have mentioned, the service at this RC location is less than great. Typically I order for carry-out, as the delivery time is usually more than an hour out from ordering. And, nearly every time I've gone to pick-up my pizza, I end up waiting an extra 15 minutes, or in the case of my last order, 30 minutes. To add insult to injury, after waiting for an additional 30 minutes (along with about 8 other carry-out customers), my pizza was burnt around the edges and generally over cooked. The employees are usually friendly but many also seem quite frazzled. 

Although I can't currently recommend this location, I do really like the Roman Candle on Willy St, where I've had great experiences with take-out and dining in. I feel like I'm getting a completely different pizza there, to the point where I wonder how these two locations are actually the same business."}
{"text":"So thankful that they had a vegan option. And man was it GOOD!"}
{"text":"I had the Animal Lover's pizza while I was there. It was delicious! Everything tasted very fresh. Having red peppers (instead of green, which is what I normally get on pizzas) was a great flavor. The crust was very tasty -- sort of hand-tossed type.
The only complaint I have is that it was pretty cold inside -- I'm sure it is because Wisconsin weather is just like that, but having some sort of barrier for each time the door opens so that a gust of cold air doesn't blow in would be great."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is a people pleaser, and they've definitely pleased me.

My party settled on the Algo Malo pizza, and it was very rich and delicious. A little heavy on the arugula, but that's an easy fix. Split between three people, we were still able to take a piece of the large pizza home. The prices are a little high, but manageable compared to their competition.

The service while dining in is very, very friendly so that is a huge plus. Even despite being busy with a near full house, the phone ringing off the hook inquiring orders, and only one oven working, nothing felt rushed or lackluster. I really appreciated that.

Another positive is that their menu is very flexible to their patrons wants and needs, be it substituting a certain kind of sauce (they have like 4?) or customizing your own pizza."}
{"text":"TLDR : good pizza and beer. Our server was very funny and attentive. 

Shared three specialty pizzas the Roman candle, pastoria and one pizza with artichoke hearts that currently escapes me. All three were brought out promptly and delicious with perhaps slightly too much grease. Our server was funny and attentive to our needs filling up our water and beer glasses as needed. 

Our party of 8 ended up spending a total of 80 for three large pizzas and various beers. Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today. Got the lunch special which allowed a pick two option. I got the Roman candle slice and garden salad.

Pros:
-Staff is very nice 
-clean restaurant great location
-lots of toppings on pizza 
-inexpensive 

Con
-wilted lettuce on salad
-pizza could have been more hot, a little soggy

Nothing special but a pretty good lunch option. I like the options of the healthy salad with pizza. Then I only eat one slice instead of two!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I stopped in for some pizza after sundown. Was a good way to end a long day; we each got a small pizza and shared a hummus plate. 
Both came out as ordered and perfectly cooked. 

I was impressed by the service, the options (which had a good bit of vegetarian in it), and even the desserts looked good. They have a few local taps too. Overall, really solid place for dinner, especially if you don't want to have sit for a full 3-course meal and don't mind waiting for a fresh pie."}
{"text":"pizza crust that isn't too crunchy and isn't too soft is hard to come by, but Roman Candle does it just right.  add a very expansive menu and a nice location right in the middle of Willy Street and this is a great place for those nights when you don't feel like cooking (especially with delivery, carry-out, and eat-in available).  

atmosphere is a bit bright and boring, nothing to show off to friends, but everything above certainly makes it a fantastic back-up place when you can't decide what you feel like eating."}
{"text":"My children and I were at the location inside of the Children's Museum, which is directly supervised by the Roman Candle on Willy St. When we went to order this location was out of pizza, out of fruit, and, apparently, out of good service.
The cashier was rude and disdainful. Sydney rolled her eyes multiple times and huffed at me when I asked about when pizza would be available. She was incredibly rude in all of her mannerisms. 
After receiving the microwaved macaroni and cheese, yogurt, and milk for my children (at the low low price of $6.50 for such pre-packaged delicacies) I went back to the counter to have my daughters mac and cheese re-heated as it was stone cold. I stood there for several minutes, right in front of Sydney and Emer (the supervisor) without being acknowledged. Then when I finally was, it was by Emer, the supposed supervisor of this location. She was far more pleasant than Sydney, which I was grateful for. 
After my children and I had finished our meal, I went to find out how to contact the supervisor of this particular location. Emer told me that she was in charge. When I explained to her the completely inappropriate behavior Sydney had displayed, she then made several excuses, accused me of stealing a juice box, then spoke over me in a rude manner. After I gave her my opinion on the service I had received, she rolled her eyes and said that she would be sure to pass my thoughts on to her boss. I expressed my lack of faith in her following through on that and asked for her managers number. She snorted at me, tore off a piece of register tape, wrote down the number, and said 'You go ahead and do that right now, we'll see what happens.'
Tonight I attempted to speak with Mat, the general manager, and he was unavailable. I will call again tomorrow and hope that this is taken care of in an appropriate manner. 
These are the public faces of this company, they are the ones making an impression even before the food can. To have such rude and ill mannered people representing a business should be completely unacceptable for any business owner."}
{"text":"Roman Candle may have the best selection of homemade cocktails that I have seen in the Madison area. On any given night they have a selection of 4-5 small batch cocktails on tap using fantastic ingredients, ask Del one of the many excellent bartenders to explain them to you. 

As for food their pizza is also fantastic featuring hand crafted pizzas with fine ingredients. Many of their ingredients are made in-house including their pizza sauces. 

All in all my favorite pizza place and bar in all of Madison. Come in!"}
{"text":"this is our go-to dine-in pizza spot on the West Side.  The kids love to play in the downstairs play space and the pizza is delicious.  My favorite pizza flavor is the Algo Malo.  It's surprisingly yummy."}
{"text":"I tried Roman Candle Pizzeria today and I wish I hadn't wasted my money.  The pizza tasted worse than Digiorno frozen pizza at twice the price.  If you've ever had the unfortunate chance of eating at a Cici's pizza buffet...this was worse.

Food:
I ordered the Margherita pizza.  Pretty simple.  It was advertised as having their original sauce, fresh mozzarella, basil, and roma tomatoes.  Tomatoes were ok, not super fresh but ok.  The moz was good although VERY VERY little (one small piece per slice).  Same goes for the fresh basil...one MAYBE two leafs cut up on the whole pizza.  The sauce was really sweet and not fresh tomato sweet, artificial sweet.  The crust was terrible.  It was like a limp dish rag.  I SERIOUSLY doubt it was fresh and bet it was premade frozen.  

Service:
My server was friendly...the whole two times I saw him.  He took my order, brought me my food, and that was it.  Didn't check up on me once and I had to go inside to get/pay my bill after waiting 20 minutes after I was finished eating.  While I expect fresh pizza's to take a while, I waited over an hour for mine (it wasn't very busy either).

Atmosphere:
I sat outside because I had my dog with me...bad idea.  While I can't necessarily blame Roman Candle, the street was filled with creepy homeless people begging for money/food.  It felt very unsafe and the customers next to me said the same thing.

Summary:
While I have no problem dropping $14 on a good pizza made with fresh ingredients, this place does NOT serve good pizza nor is the service up to par."}
{"text":"I was so pleased when I moved to Middleton from the east side that there was a Roman Candle pizza close by.  This is my favorite pizza restaurant (Glass Nickel is also very good).  Roman Candle has great pizzas with interesting and local toppings.  The salads are fresh and creative, and they have good local beers on tap. The mac and cheese and cheesebread is also very good.  I especially like the lunch specials, too.   There are often coupons in local mailings if you want to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"I never dine in, this review is based on my pick up and delivery experiences.

I looooove me some Roman Candle! Some of my favorite picks that you cannnnnot go wrong with are their candlestix, the original are alright, but I love the deluxe candlestix with spinach, garlic, and tomatoes. I am totally guilty of ordering those twice in a day on occasion. Their pizzas are all yummy, but some of my favorites are the Taco Pizza (El Jeffe) with olives instead of meat, the Veggie Candle, and the Pestoral. I have yet to try the Algo Malo and Cheeseburger, which are next on my list. 

You can order pizzas by the slice and grab a beer or ice cream cone while you wait. Their happy hour and lunch specials are way worth it. $10 on any small pizza during lunch time, which makes it possible to try something new on the menu that you might not have tried in the past due to the price. They also have a red pepper soup that is to die for! It comes with a breadstick to dip. Their salads are also well presented and tasty, like their desserts, tiramisu and carrot cake! 

Not in the mood for pizza? Grab some ice cream in a waffle cone - my go to. If you're feeling extra and in the mood to be different, try the Blue Moon Float. It's worth the picture and a cavity or two for the year."}
{"text":"We love this place.  Consist good food and fantastic service   Better service than more formal dining.  And a great garden salad with delicious homemade goddess dressing."}
{"text":"Wow, I must say I'm super shocked at the excitement of the reviews about this place! I live nearby and and have tried Roman Candle multiple times, so I'd like to say I've given them a fair shot at winning my business. 

My most recent and last experience was the worst. The Caesar salad was a sad bowl of lettuce and croutons, for 8 bucks. The dressing, which had a nasty thick yellow slimy film on the top was anything but Caesar dressing.... my husband and I think it may have been deviled egg filling??? P.s. they forgot the anchovies! Really, how many ingredients go in a Caesar salad? 

On to the pizza, we had the margarita and Brad R. was right on the money.... not legit! They were out of basil (what Italian pizza joint runs out of basil?), the mozzarella was not fresh at all and the tomatoes were pale and yellowish. Don't even get me started on the over-sauced crust, the thin crust couldn't even hold up to it! This, along with the other pizzas I've had there in the past, where not good. 

Roman Candle, I really wanted to love you, but I'm tired of the disappointment!"}
{"text":"Five days before an event, I ordered 15 pizzas to be delivered for a birthday party at a very specific time. The morning of the event after seeing guest count drop due to widespread flu, I called to remove two of the pizzas, which was very easy to do. They arrived on time, which I really appreciated.

I ordered nearly one of every specialty pizza they have. Clearly I didn't try all of them. People commented on them and I'd give them three stars.

The overall review is two stars because the gluten free pizza arrived on the charred side. The edges were black, the bottom browned and crunchy. I understand that these are thin crusts and can get overcooked in a moment, but I don't think this should have been sent to be delivered. I would have much preferred that the other pizzas arrived on time, and a notice from the driver that the missing one would arrive shortly after.

Considering I ordered these well in advance and spent $600 on this order, a little more care could have been taken to deliver a more presentable pizza."}
{"text":"Roman Candle and Glass Nickel are constantly competing against each other. They're both quite popular. They share another trait, too: neither is very good.

Roman Candle approaches pizza with a half-assed attempt at gourmet pies. Very, very expensive gourmet pies. Pizzas are often too thick and undercooked, toppings are thrown on in an uneven manner, and the crust is terrible.

I give them two stars, solely on the basis that they use local ingredients. But, as far as pizza quality goes? No way."}
{"text":"Overall good pizza, but extremely overpriced for what amounts to a pseudo-gourmet approach, with some major 'special' pizza missteps. The food here is very expensive, quality is slightly-above-average, and quantity is less-than-average. I recently had the triple pepperoni pizza, and frankly it was gross. Huge uncooked chunks of salami (not pepperoni), large 'handcut' pieces stuck together creating a wet grease pile...but some very good 'regular' pepperoni, for over $20. Mac and cheese was almost literally four macaroni noodles for what amounted to exorbitant cost. I've had great experiences getting a quick slice of cheese, so I wouldn't give Candle a pass, but a reserved recommendation. Mostly, I guess I just don't understand why ingredients are so expensive when the quality and execution standards aren't consistent."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place as we were driving around town late night looking for some pizza. The place had a good vibe to it, good pizza, large slices. The bread sticks we got as a starter were really good."}
{"text":"Pretty good, the pizza could use a bit more garlic. I like that they have good vegetarian and vegan options! The ice cream hit the spot even in the winter."}
{"text":"For lunch I had a caesar salad that was good but the lettuce leaves were the bitter outer leaves and the dressing was so-so - and this is why I marked it as 3 stars and not 4. The pizza was very good - mozzarella cheese, kalamata olives, and fresh mushrooms. They could have been a little more generous with the toppings, but overall it was very good."}
{"text":"With the Roman Candle, you get what you pay for.  It's pricey for the average college student or grad student in this town, but gives you real bang for your buck with all of their pies.  Also, they do have some monthly deals that make eating there more worth it (like free icecream with your purchase, or garlic bread, or even 25% off offers).  I wasn't as impressed by their salads, but that's not really why you go to a pizza place anyway...  Their interior has a warm and friendly atmosphere that's good for families and others. Best pizza I've had in Madison."}
{"text":"We just had a horrible experience.  Horrible service.  We had called ahead and asked if they had room for a large group. We were assured that they could handle us.  We arrived at 1:50 pm (after the lunch crowd) and were the only people there.  We were there for 30 minutes before one of our group went and got our drink orders and served them for us.  We also poured our own water.  Only 3-4 people actually got their food after 1 hour.  One of the orders had a long hair in it.  Complained that we had to leave for a hockey game and they just said go."}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on food quality only since my dad and I got delivery.

Basically, the pizza is ok. Maybe for a thin crust pizza in the Midwest it's something special, but it really is pretty average compared to any pizza you could get on the east coast. That's not to say it's bad, just that it isn't great.

Also, although the prices for just plain pizzas are alright, the prices for toppings are ludicrous. If you want something like chicken on your pizza it's something like an extra $4! Toppings are usually about $2 or less each so if you want to create your own pizza, be prepared to pay for it.

Overall, I gave Roman Candle 3 stars because of the average quality and the high price that you have to pay for it. If the toppings were cheaper, I would probably give 4 stars."}
{"text":"I adore the fact that you can get big slabs of buffalo mozzarella on these pizzas.  I think everyone's quality of life would improve if they had more pizza with fresh mozza on it.  ;)  I've had a custom pizza with said mozzarella, and the Pestoral at the urging of my gustatorily trustworthy boyfriend.  Both were excellent, though the Pestoral was pretty darn greasy (it is pesto, after all).

I'm not very fond of the pizzeria's layout nor the tables that aren't along the wall.  It's always crazy busy, which is why I haven't gone more often.  Plus, it's pretty expensive for pizza.  Still, it's delicious and worth trying!"}
{"text":"Roman Candle has not let me down yet. As a lactose-intolerant pescatarian, i always struggle to find a pizza place that makes a good cheese-less pizza. Trust me, it's a skill that not many pizza parlors have/care to cultivate. 

Not only does Roman Candle have a cheese-less pizza, they actually advertise it as one of their specialty pizzas! The Vegan Destroyer literally destroyed my hunger, haha. It comes with red pepper puree (if you're looking to eat outside the traditional tomato sauce box), and incredibly fresh toppings. Now I don't have to cry inside when my company orders pizza for lunch! :D"}
{"text":"I came here with my sister on a weekday and it was satisfyingly awesome.  The owners are super friendly.  There was torrential downpour outside and as a few people ducked under the building's awning to avoid the rain, he went out and invited them to wait inside. 

They have a lunch special that runs pretty late into the afternoon and you choose two of pasta, pizza, or salad and a drink for 7.50.  Also from 3-5pm, their pints of beer is only 2.50.  Lucky for us, we were there right at 3pm.  

We split a 12 inch \"The Professional\" specialty pizza and it was delicious.  The jalapenos gave it just a bit of a kick, but not too much.  I loved how green the pizza was with the broccoli and jalapenos.  The crust wasn't too thick nor was it cracker thin.  It was a nice pan style thickness with a bit of chew.  The 12 inch with 2 beers was the perfect amount of food for us.  

The atmosphere is charming and friendly.  I'd love to find another weekday afternoon to chill here for beers and conversation with a good friend."}
{"text":"Generally speaking I love this place... at least the pizza.  But we visited on 9/16 and had a less than desirable experience. And least for the price.

Ordered the soup, fruit cup for the toddler and \"jumbo wings\".

The soup was just over room temperature, we didn't complain mostly because it took so long to get it and the beer that we ordered immediately.  The wings, \"jumbo wings\" (see photo) were actually almost comically small - however the flavour spot on (ginger teriyaki).

Fruit was good , decent portion .  Beer was cold, when it got there.

Honestly we were confused with who was waiting on us....

I've had good experiences here, but this was some of the worst."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with a great aesthetic! Great for eat in or carry out. Don't be scared to try the firecracker sauce, it's to die for!"}
{"text":"I used to make roman candles for the 4th of July celebrations. (you need 4 or five soup cans, a can opener, some gasoline, a tennis ball and a match.)   Now I need to shoot one off for this restaurant!  
Stopped by to patronize Roman Candle for their stance on the union busting bill and their concern about being a part of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association.  Boy am I glad I did.  The pizza was delicious and I plan to be back.  Thanks to Roman Candle for having a conscience and for making some very good pizza.  Your get an extra star for your work and support of the protesters."}
{"text":"Finally popped into this place for lunch last week and had the Algo Malo slice...AWWWWESOME!!!!! They have a super cool Specialty Pizza menu and their service is superb and friendly! The interior is open, bright and fun with a few window tables AND they've got great sidewalk cafe seating! They serve both beer and CHOCOLATE SHOPPE ICE CREAM!!!! How is this not the best combination of great pizza eating?!?! I LOVE this place!!!"}
{"text":"While the pizza was delicious (I especially liked the Cheeseburger pizza), the service here killed me. We went in shortly after opening and were sat by our server. We waited a total of 10 minutes with no one coming by our table (we were the only table in the restaurant). The manager (i'm assuming) was behind the bar area looking at paperwork, and another server was putting up Christmas Decorations. We kept looking around going...are they just gonna ignore us? After 10 minutes (I timed it) I had to get up and go ask if they were going to serve us. They apologized and said there was a miscommunication about who was helping us and the girl that sat us ended up serving. Either way, after 10 minutes, SOMEONE should have said something! We were so close that we could hear them talking about what they should make for a new pizza. If we could hear the details for that, they could hear us expressing our frustration with being ignored...and being the only people in the restaurant and ignored. If that was me I would have sent over a manager to apologize, yet nothing. Nothing other than sorry he thought it was my table and I thought it was his. 

The pizza was good but honestly not good enough for me to want come back. I've got no problems with things like this when a restaurant is busy, or even if I felt the apology was sincere. But when that doesn't add up, I'll spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great pizza in interesting surroundings.  Staff is very friendly and service was good."}
{"text":"After the rave reviews I'll admit I may have had unduly high expectations for this pizza.  

I got half margherita and half the roman candle(banana peppers, sausage and spicy sauce).  They were unable to do different sauces on each half of the pizza(pretty weak) so the margherita had spicy sauce too which was straight because I'm a spicy food fiend.

The roman candle was pretty good but the margherita pizza was not legit at all, they don't use fresh basil, and the fresh mozzarella isn't that fresh either and lacks flavor and they skimp on the tomatoes.

Roman candle serves up mediocre to decent pizza at best."}
{"text":"We were served quickly.  Got soup, a slice and a beer - it was the perfect lunch for a blustery day.  Plus their lunch time deal is for a soft drink, but our server counted the beers as our soft drinks which was a pleasant surprise.  I was diggin' the Michael Jackson on the stereo as well.  Seeing that this place is about fifty feet from my house I know I'll be back."}

{"text":"Stopped into Roman Candle while in Madison for the CrossFit Games.

The staff was friendly, but a little slow. However, after a long day of spectating we were happy to enjoy the atmosphere which was casual, laid back, and trendy.

The Gluten Free crust was delicious and much appreciated. Roman Candle curated a pizza special for the CrossFit Games which had a Thai curry sauce base. It was FANTASTIC and I will absolutely be recreating this at home. The Mediterranean Pizza also had the best cheese on it. Great price for an order of wings and 2 pizzas.

They also served beer and ice cream - all local!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 pizza's for pickup at 5:00 pm- carryout- to take over to Capitol Brewery (see other review) for a concert.  First off....this is not the first time I've had this pizza....I love Roman Candle pizzeria!  And their customer service is second to none.  A couple of years ago I was in the Fitchburg location and complained somewhere about there not being WIFI....the operations manager, James (?), emailed me within 2 hours on a Saturday night (!) to let me know the password etc.  This location was no different.  The minute I walked in they were offering me assistance...oh and this location has a back door with parking.....anywayz....there was a lot going on....chatter and happy vibes from both the customers and the employees.  I ordered a margherita and a sausage and pepperoni.  The margherita was spot on delicious!!  The sausage and pepp I thought lacked cheese.  It seemed a little dry.  It was good...but I thought they were skimpy with the cheese."}
{"text":"Great Pizza (disclosure, I used to work there) but to me the true standout is the Roasted Red Pepper Tomato Bisque soup....it is unbelievable, I have to have some every time I'm in Madison.  Hoping to see a Milwaukee location someday!"}
{"text":"+diet sensitive. The gluten free, the vegetarian, the meat eaters, and non pizza lovers in the group could eat here.
-options. Single slices, pies of various sizes, customizable sauces, cheese, etc.
+creative salads. Caprese here was my first ever. Fresh.

-service. Leaving one of the pizza's behind until we flag down your coworker to ask you about it ain't cool.
-I would have liked a check in or two from service.

We were here because the recommended Villa such and such up the street had a 25 minute wait, and the main guest wanted pizza. That sums up my recommendation for Roman Candle - a good backup plan but not a place you want to make your primary select to take your out of town visitors."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I recently moved from the near east side to Middleton, and since Roman Candle on Willy St. was a frequent of ours, we hoped the Middleton location would not disappoint.

Same great pizza, still a nice vibe--took one star off because  they don't have as much outdoor seating as the east side, and it's just not as open and light.

We like the House Salad(greens with tomato, cucumber, bacon, blue cheese and balsamic). It's so good. 

As far as pizza, the Pestoral(feta, artichoke, kalamata olives, roasted red pepper, and yes...pesto) and the Margherita(classic with roma tomato, basil and fresh mozzarella slices) are the BEST. My boyfriend does get a hankerin' for some meat on occasion, and their sausage mushroom is good too!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood pizza joint in the truest sense of the term.  You instantly feel like family and the pizza is amazing.  I particularly like The Professional and the soup is exceptional.  There's better pizza joints out there but not many that are as warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place to come for a casual meal in downtown Middleton. I like sitting near the large windows at the front with nice natural light. The booth seating is a little odd as it's quite high off the floor, and makes one prone to accidental footsie below the table. The decor is colorful and fun.

Pizza here is quite good- you can customize it or order one of their menu options. The salads have housemade dressings, and the ones I've tried were very good. The large salad really is quite big, the small was a decent size for a meal for me, especially if you're getting an appetizer. I have also had pasta here that was delicious. 

Nice staff here that's perfectly nice with midwestern charm."}
{"text":"It was a blustery afternoon, and everyone was starving. Not feeling like cooking dinner,we decided to order three pizzas from Roman Candle. They were tasty. 

The Roman Candle started with a beloved neighborhood hotspot located on eclectic Willy St, and has since expanded into a local chain, perhaps losing a dash of its original charm along the way. (Reviews for Fitchburg are generally negative). 

However, the charm-factor was in overdrive today, as our experience was fabulous from start to finish... Well almost. 

We ordered a Vegan Destroyer. Delicious, fresh, earthy... This place knows it's pizza... It's the real deal. Kudos to RC for being consistently vegan and special diet friendly. A neighboring hole-in-the-wall called Lao Laan-Xang did not fare well in this department.

In other news, delivery was accurate, fast and friendly. So. What's the catch? The price.

Extremely expensive. $70 without tip for 3 pizzas... Terrifyingly pricey... This Madison mainstay lost 2 stars for exorbitant retail price alone, but ultimately fared well with its attention to dietary sensitivities. Worth the money? You decide."}
{"text":"I don't know if management changed, but this place really got better overnight.  The menu is different and includes a really nice vegan option now.  The service is better.  And we've had several orders in a row that were perfectly prepared.  Nice."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and bread sticks! I loved this place. First of all the food was excellent (especially the breadsticks and margarita pizza), the atmosphere was laid back and so adorable, and the staff was super friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is a pizza junkie like me (;"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the Animal Lovers pizza and I've previously had a good experience here, but my last visit was less than stellar. 

My BF and I came in the night before New Year's Eve around 8 PM. It was pretty dead with only one other table occupied. We ordered two sodas, an order of herbed breadsticks, and two small pizzas - Animal Lovers (veggie) for me, and a build-your-own meat pizza for him. 

+ Everyone was really friendly...
- ...but the actual service wasn't their strong point. We didn't really get checked in on, I had to request a refill when my drink went empty, we weren't given any plates or napkins with our breadsticks, and when I went up to ask for napkins the server was there bent over the counter reading a paper/doing a puzzle. Fine since it was slow, but I wasn't a fan of having to get up to ask for basics. 
- All the broccoli on my pizza was burnt. Since the server didn't come over to check on us I ended up eating two pieces after picking off the broccoli. I wouldn't have requested another one anyway, it would be dumb to trash a whole pizza that was otherwise edible, but I also didn't feel right complaining since I'd eaten more than a couple of bites while waiting for someone to come over to check in on the food. 

As mentioned, I'd previously dined in and had a good experience so I'm going to chalk it up to holiday madness, but I've had better nights at other pizzerias, including other Roman Candle locations."}
{"text":"I got hooked on the Animal Lover's pizza when I worked at the Madison Children's Museum, and it's by far my favorite veggie pizza in town. Roasted red peppers and the perfect amount of cheese just hit the spot for me. I've also fallen into a dangerous love affair with their herbed breadsticks - if there was no minimum delivery I'd probably just order them alone and shame-eat the whole box. 

For a stretch of time I had a really, really hard time getting delivery from this location via their online system - even at 6 o'clock on a weeknight it would tell me that there were no more available delivery times that night despite being open until 10. After a year or so of not ordering from them I tried again and the last few times I've had no issues.

Keep an eye out for coupons - Roman Candle isn't cheap, but the upside is that you get what you pay for and the ingredients have always been fresh and flavorful."}
{"text":"Well, they deliver. The pizza is particularly bready with a smooth underside and a Glass Nickel-style top. It's not nearly as greasy as GN, but also not as tasty. I'm perplexed at the variance in reviews here. My understanding is that RC is more of a delivery pizza (\"safe choice\" at campus events), and I've yet to hear a bad detail in that regard. If you are looking to sit in, there are better pizzas in town."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and I was impressed with their pizza both times. The dining environment is cozy and laid back. The service wasn't the best, but the pizza was ready really fast and was delicious. My fiance and I shared a pitcher of good beer and two large specialty pizzas, and had plenty to take home for leftovers. I like their vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"Everyone loved the \"Pestoral\" pizza, even our 14-year-old son (who almost never eats his veggies)!"}
{"text":"We were in Madison for 5 nights...we ended up eating here twice because it was so good. We split the asparagus, the house salad, and the Supreme pizza with a gluten free crust and habanero drizzle. Also enjoyed a locally brewed smoked porter, and of course, some AMAZING ice cream.   We loved the little play area for our 2 year old, and our server was amazing on checking with us even though we were the only people down in the basement, and we took our time enjoying beers on a Friday night. The host the original night we went (just got some to go that night) was SO cool..brought out a coloring book for our daughter while we waited, and made awesome pizza recommendations. Really, really loved this place...please come to Denver!!! :)"}
{"text":"Pros:
+ The folks who work here are very nice 
+ They have a decent variety of toppings and sauces
+ They sell pizza by the slice
+They sell Chocolate Shoppe ice cream
+The first time I ate here I had a really, really good pizza

Cons:
-The ten or so subsequent visits have been terrible. This isn't good pizza. It somehow tastes like it's been reheated or frozen even when it's fresh out of the oven. The crust is a tad too thick and it's cooked for too long in an oven that's not hot enough. 

-It's expensive. Once you put enough toppings on it to render it edible, it costs just as much as a specialty pie at Sal's or Grandpa's

- On two occasions I got ridiculous (like 2 hour) quotes on delivery times. When I decided to pick it up it took almost twice as long as they said it would. 

This one's a pass."}
{"text":"Vegan Destroyer... you've destroyed my notion that pizza places can't get vegan pizza right. Our server (vegan herself!) said that it was the real deal and she nailed it. Spinach, toasted pine nuts, green olives, red onions, red pepper puree, & fresh basil... stop me now. Ben and I split a large (our server recommended bigger is better for two since it's a bit less sumptuous without cheese), which was perfecto. Good selection of tap beers, I got Capital seasonal and Ben got Bell's Two Hearted. 

Tip: Get the spicy fireworks sauce. Firey explosion of flava in your mouth."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

They're fast, good, and always on point. I'm a pizza fanatic and have had tons of pizza, but for a local place they've got it down. 

I usually order the classic Roman candle and the taco pizza and both are good. If they added guacamole on it it would be amazing. 

I haven't eaten inside so I'm not sure how good dine in is, but they do an okay job for carry out and are on time."}
{"text":"The Candle has some awesome pizza combinations, and I love their thin crust!! The veggie pizza was delicious with the fresh spinach and basil shredded over top, yum!! Another up side was ordering by the slice, nice if you're not hungry enough for a whole pizza but still need to feed the craving."}
{"text":"This review is based on my carryout experience.  Wow, do they pack a ton of cheese on their pizzas!  I know this is the dairy state and cheese is king, but the cheese on our recent artichoke/banana pepper pizza masked most of the flavor.  And when combined with an under-baked crust it resulted in a smushy, flavorless mess.  2 stars seems a bit low, but the pizza we ordered definitely was not a 3 star 'a okay' pizza.  If we try them again I'll definitely ask for at least half the amount of cheese and a crisper crust.  Their crust does have a nice flavor and airy texture and prices are reasonable (even more so when combined with a coupon)."}
{"text":"I'm still waiting on my slice after 25 minutes, and there's no one else here.

But for an actual review (as this example of service happens ALL THE TIME when I eat lunch, which is at 2)...  Their pizza is fantastic, but can come very dry.  So order marinara on the side if you like a saucy pizza.  Sadly, you may have to specify WARM marinara (as I've gotten freezing cold sauce in a cup before, like she took it out of the fridge).  The pasta is pretty good, a little bland, but after adding veggies, s/p and some parm, it's very good.  Honestly, I really like the crust, and that keeps me coming back.  The service is SUPER spotty, like 50% good/bad at either location, but the pizza is great (with a side of sauce). :D  The salads will never steer you wrong, nor will the tomato red pepper soup.

This is the only place I will order a side of sauce to finish off the crust with; I love it that much.  Otherwise, pizza bones go in the trash.

I went to the east side site the last two days in a row, and today to the west.  Both times at east I had excellent service and awesome food.  Today at west, I had a server who I think was management, as he was on the phone and had a laptop out, and was trying to train someone (even though there was a regular server there).  My glass was empty through most of the meal (got a refill at the very end) and when I asked for marinara, he brought out pizza sauce.  I realize this is nitpicky (because at least it was warm), but it wasn't what I asked for.  I don't much care for their pizza sauce, but LOVE the marinara.  This has happened quite a few times (only at west) that a server has self-corrected my order (and charged me for it).  

I also get the mac n' cheese pretty frequently, and it has never been the same twice.  It may be a small reason to downgrade to two stars, but nothing is ever consistant."}
{"text":"While the pizza here is good, their service is unfortunately terrible. We have ordered from numerous times in the past month and they have proceeded to get our order wrong more than  once even after leaving specific instructions for them on the order. 

In addition, I recently ordered a chicken ceased salad, and requested no cheese. They delivered a ceased salad with no chicken in it, but cheese on it. The salad was mediocre at best and not worth the $12 price  

I would not recommend them because of the poor service and will not be ordering from them in the future."}
{"text":"Good pizza, great soup.

We had a amazing Roasted Red Pepper bisque. It is the house soup, so it is available every day. The soup has a deep roasted, complex depth that is sometimes difficult to achieve. It is thick with a course puree of savory vegtables.  It is served with a rich swirl of cream on top. It comes with an  breadstick, perfect for soaking up every last bit of soup. 
 
I love pizza and rarely find on that I don't like. So of course, I like the pizza. It has a thin crust but not too thin. It is soft with a little crunch. Not remarkable in flavor-somewhat bland. 

I have had the greek, firecracker, and the BBQ chicken pizza. My favorite is the Firecracker. I love the yellow peppers and the spicy sauce. The sausage is a perfect addition. The BBQ is similar to Glass Nickel, with generous chunks of chicken, red onions, cheddar and a thick BBQ sauce as the base.  The greek pizza has large chunks of feta-but not too much, kalamata olives where a great addition. 

I love the little table that flips down from the wall to put your pizza on-saves table space. When not in use it becomes part of the \"Jetson-like\" decor. Very clever

The service is prompt and friendly. We came in 30-40 minutes before closing time-no attitude from the waitress and we didn't feel rushed.

I have dined in Middleton once an d Willy st. twice. I think the food was better on Willy street. Service in Middleton was excellent."}
{"text":"Great little pizzeria!  I have been here several times and the pizza is so yummy.  I ordered a medium sausage, artichoke, caramelized onion, and mushroom pizza.  I must say the have the best sausage I've EVER eaten on a pizza. Artichokes were seasoned nicely and wonderful fresh mushrooms!  

The reason for only 4 stars was the service.  We waited 10 minutes with out being served with menus and drinks.  The waiter was rushed and seemed to hide in the back a lot.  Drink refills were scarce and we waited forever for our pizza. But it was truly worth the wait and I hope the service incident was isolated.  

We will be return customers!"}
{"text":"The Roman Candle is a cool pizza joint with friendly service. I had a 12-inch \"vegan destroyer\" ($14) which was a simple pie covered in spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts and pureed red pepper. It also featured the shop's signature \"firecracker\" sauce which is a tomato sauce spiced up with chipotle.

The pizza was tasty but, at $14, pretty expensive considering the small size. I finished off the whole pizza with no difficulty.

Also, given how hip and funky this place aims to be, it surprised me that there are no vegan cheeses or vegan mockmeat toppings offered here (how about some Daiya vegan cheese? Or a nut cheese, like the \"rinotta\" offered at Pizza Luce in the Twin Cities? Or some phony pepperoni and Gimme Lean vegan sausage?). Roman Candle is missing out on serving its vegan and vegetarian customers better; moreover, no other place in Madison offers any of those items, so Roman Candle could fill a great niche.

Also, there are no vegan desserts, which is amazing given that they serve ice cream from The Chocolate Shoppe (which carries at least two vegan ice cream flavors at its downtown Madison branch). They could also source some of the amazing vegan desserts served at The Green Owl or the Willy Street Co-op, both just down the road.

The service was really friendly, though it took a good 20 minutes for my pizza to arrive, even though the place wasn't busy when I visited.

All told, Roman Candle is not bad, but they could easily improve themselves by adding some vegan options."}
{"text":"Salad was mediocre at best. Server messed up my order(he didn't write anything down). Pizza came out cold. To make it worse, I was the only person in the restaurant. I will try again, as the pizza flavor was good (cold pizza never hurt anyone)."}
{"text":"The service was fine, nothing special but I have no complaints.  Sat outside on a beautiful day, so that was nice.  They serve mostly local/organic ingredients, which is great and commendable.  But then the pizza came and it was like they took those quality ingredients and did all they could to make them terrible.  Most freezer pizza is better than this.  Jacks is comparable.  Crust was bland.  Sauce, cheese and fresh basil were all.........edible.  The sausage was pretty decent.  Unfortunately there wasn't enough of it for me to give a full review.  And then the bill came and capped off the disappointing experience.  I love to buy and shop local, but this establishment definitely tested that philosophy and came up with an F.  I think madison's commitment to buying local/fresh/organic is the only thing keeping this place in business(I really don't understand how there are multiple stores).  I will try to return here one day(in the distant future) because everybody deserves a second chance?"}
{"text":"Website issues... We ordered online to pick up and the system gave us an estimated pickup time. However their website didn't log our order so there was not pizza ready for us when we got there. No apologies offered. No courtesy received. We still stayed because we really liked the pizza from here. The service that we received at our table was not the greatest though."}
{"text":"Pizza was great.   We did a supreme and a build your own meat lovers type pizza.
The sauce and sausage were very good.  And the veggies were fresh. 
Delivery was on time.  Pizzas were a little pricey compared to a chain type pizza, but it was worth it.
We went with this store because they have gluten free crust. I did a build your own gluten free. Crust was great. Only downside is they don't offer dairy free cheese. And cheeseless pizza isn't always fun. 

Large Greek salad was good too. It was definitely enough to feed 2-3 as menu said.

I recommend this place and the only room for improvement would be for a dairy free person like myself. Otherwise my family loved the house blend of cheese!!

Build your own gluten free 
Greek salad"}
{"text":"Roman Candle has yet to knock my socks off. I've been there a handful of times now and have never been wowed. 

The pizza is good, but not great. Their house salad is slightly above par. The $7 lunch special for a soda/soup or salad/slice of pizza is a good deal. It's nice because you can just get soup/salad or two pieces of pizza. 

I'll go here if someone wants to go but won't go too far out of my way."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent and it is one of the kid friendliest restaurants in town (it has a dedicated dining and play area for parents with kids). That said, the pizza is soooooo much better at the restaurant than when you order delivery. I'm no sure why, but the pizza is never as good when they deliver, it always comes very lukewarm."}
{"text":"This one was a disappointment. I gave two stars because I felt the caption \"Meh. I've experienced better\" says it all. I came in here thinking Roman Candle, in the hierarchy of pizzerias in Madison would place below Pizza Bruta but above Glass Nickel. What I found was a mediocre pie, and in fact, not as good as Glass Nickel. I ordered the house salad, it was good, fresh, which is becoming a rarity in Madison. I am finding a lot of brown, slimy lettuce, even at the \"so called\" better restaurants. The dressing was a house balsamic. Nothing spectacular, standard fare, very common about ten years ago. There were two points of note, I felt the bacon was too much for the salad, and the dressing was thick, too thick for a balsamic vinaigrette. The salad didn't cost Roman Candle any points. My issue is with the pizza.

This is a case where perception met reality with a thud. First, I noticed that fresh basil is a topping at Roman Candle. I highly recommend that one adds this as a topping. This pizza needs basil. It also needs more cheese. I wouldn't say double cheese as the crust is not hearty enough to hold it, but certainly more than what was on mine. The lack of cheese exposes the sauce and its faults. First, for all the little legends on the menu, the fact that the cheese is from Wisconsin still does not point to a creamy, fresh tasting mozzarella. In fact, this was a dry tasteless cheese. The problem is when you have very little cheese and what there is, is tasteless, the sauce has to dominate. In this case, the sauce is exposed as bitter.

There are very few varietals of pizza that allow the sauce to be bitter. Pizza sauce should be sweet. It should be sweet and sassy, like a young playful girl. It should not be bitter. The sauce should peek above the cheese to touch the crust. That part is a pleasure to eat or should be, if it existed. Its where the bare sauce is cooked onto the crust. No such on this pizza.

The biggest let down were the meats. The menu says \"artisinal pepperoni.\" If you say artisinal, I immediately think like Osteria Mozza in LA or Eataly in NYC. In Madison, artisinal clearly means anything not by Oscar Meyer. This is not artisinal. Its not pepperoni where you can taste the fressh pork, and the seasonings. The sausage falls victim to the same inability to impress. I guess if its not Johnson Brothers, it is gourmet.

Roman Candle is an average pizza. Nothing special, not really worth the effort to visit. If you do go, I recommend extra cheese and fresh basil. The rest is in your hands."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the quality of food, service, and prices here. The margarita pizza is stellar and one that is recommend getting at least once here. They have a very authentic style crispy crust, great sauce, and a lot of unique topping options. 
My only criticism is with the specialty pizzas, some of which are a bit pricey for what they are. We also got the Professional today, which was good, but maybe could do without the chicken to save on cost (since there's already bacon). 
Overall, I'm always pleased with their food and service! Love the outdoor seating as well."}
{"text":"The Vegan Destroyer pizza is the most pizza like pizza I've had since going vegan. It is delicious! Try it as it is before making any substitutions or subtractions. I don't love olives, but they are very necessary for this pizza. The saltiness of the olives take place of the saltiness of the cheese and the combination of everything together is really really good. I am a happy vegan!"}
{"text":"Once my wife and I found this pizza shop it became our go to pizza joint for about a year straight; favorite specialty pizzas: 

Supreme: 
Balanced, amazing sausage, fresh veggies. 

PPP: 
Prepare for heavy duty meat overload.

Animal Lovers: 
For when you want something light, sensitive stomach days.

Lunch combos are a really nice option if you're looking for a quick bite to eat. 

I generally order to go so I can bring my pizza home. I have ate inside a lot as well, the place is clean and service is always friendly. They have really neat trays that fold out from the wall that hold the pizza, and a lot of seating so there is generally a seat even during the rush hours."}
{"text":"I've had Roman Candle a number of times and have had issues half the time. Most were just little issues that I was able to overlook. Last night however was different. I ordered a gluten-free pizza last night and was very disappointed when I opened the box after delivery. The pizza crust was completely burned. The pizza slices were also separated which left toppings falling off and stuck to the box. I also had a reaction to gluten which I have not had from their pizzas in the past. Very careless on their part all around last night. I really wanted to like Roman Candle and support a local business but after this, I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is consistently in our top three Madison area pizza joints. We order thin crust, and often sausage, mushroom and onion with fireworks sauce. A few times our crust has been a little too charred, but when it's not, it's PERFECT. Good chew to the crust. 

Service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Great place for families. Solid pizza and salads, yummy Old Fashioned. Also has wings. Many vegetarian options. The Algo Malo pizza is unique with beets. Short kids menu. Retro games. Cool retro \"mod\" mid-century design. Big - we rarely wait for seating. My kids love it here."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of the Vegan Destroyer. 
I'm also a HUGE fan of chicken. 
What do you call chicken on a vegan pie? 
A Vegan Destroyer Destroyed. 
(Say that ten times fast.)

I've had RC delivery before and I've always been impressed with the fact it's piping hot when it arrives. Granted I live 5 minutes away, that might have something to do with it, but I think most folks in my hood know RC as a solid delivery place but don't think to dine in. (It's bigger than you think.) So go there, take a seat! Staff is friendly and prompt and when they have the patio setup in warmer months, it's awesome to sit outside on Willy with a cold beer or glass of wine and watch the world go by. It's also worth noting that although pizza is the name of the game, these guys have incredible starters too, the asparagus being my favorite. AND their new house-made salsas are pretty hot. I mean, Paris Hilton hot, and also spicy. Dip some Potter's crackers up in there... it's a beautiful thing."}
{"text":"My husband is from New York and went to college in New York City so he is super super picky about pizza. He thought the pizza was pretty close to New York pizza. The Mac and Cheese is nothing special and dry. I love the fact they use local ingredients and care about the environment. Willie Street is such a fun place to be in Madison. Fun to sit by the window and people watch while enjoying a slice of pizza."}
{"text":"This places has some of my favourite pizzas in Madison. I would highly recommend it to all peoples, even vegans! The fun a friendly staff are always up for a good laugh. They have always responded to my hilarious delivery requests, frequently creating works of art (see pizza box pictures for more details). 5 stars easily earned."}
{"text":"Used to love this place. 

My go to has been the Algo Malo, w/ beets, Gorgonzola, walnuts, and arugula. However, there seems to be a consistent decrease in the amount toppings. 

Arugula- usually when applied to pizza a heavy hand is needed due to wilting, not here, one could count the leaves. Gorgonzola- a small mound in the soggy center, and no where else to be found. And the worst offense- Beets, a paltry two baby beets were sacrificed for a large pizza, cut in small squares to appear bountiful.

What gives Roman Candle? I wanted to believe it was a one time thing, but i'm starting to believe you're pinching too many pennies."}
{"text":"I ordered a small Greek salad and a 8 piece chicken wing plate. As I inhaled my salad, I realized that A.) I should have gotten the large and B.) That was fricking delicious. The lettuce was crisp, I didn't see wilted lettuce and they had my salad dressing on the side. Do you know how many places have the salad swimming in the dressing? I adored the fact that I was able to apply as much or as little as I wanted.

          Now the chicken was hot, there was fat, which I love and the wings were large. Much larger than I wanted as I'm on Weight Watchers and I used all of my points on it. 

But it was worth it."}
{"text":"If my experience was carry out only then I would have left 4 stars but alas my review reflects the in-restaurant dining experience as much as the food. 

\"4 stars\" worthy: light, thin hand tossed crust that is just as delicious as the house sauce and fresh toppings. Very enjoyable and appealing to all pizza lovers. Solid. 

\"2 stars\" worthy: the service is abysmal, the servers do try but the training and oversight clearly lacks. And no, it was not busy, we were one of five tables on a Thursday night. Our server, Joey, bless his soul, didn't know the beers they carried and corrected himself twice. After he brought our food he came back to check on \"how we were doing\" 20 minutes later after we ate all but three slices of two pizzas we ordered. He never offered refills on water or soda, and each time someone at the table had to ask, even though the respective glass was empty."}
{"text":"Delicious taste.  Great ingredients.  I had the Pestoral.   Pesto, artichoke hearts, roasted red peppers, Kalamata olives, Pomodorini tomato, and Wisconsin feta cheese.   Very tasty!    Very friendly staff.  Decent decor (nothing fancy - just a neighborhood pizzeria ... I'm very casually dressed with workout gear on and I don't feel one bit out of place).  Lots of options on the menu, including wings, salads, and baked pasta.  I would definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to try Roman Candle because I've heard good things; however, I was underwhelmed.

The pizza was ok. I ordered the Roman Candle, which seemed like a good staple for a first try. The crust wasn't anything to write home about. Bland, no flavor. The fire cracker sauce was decent, but not as spicy as I thought it would be (although, being from Texas, I have a high spice tolerance). The toppings were sparse, only 2 pieces of sausage on average per piece!

Overall, mediocre. Will I ever find a good pizza place in Madison???"}
{"text":"I was torn between two and three stars here.  I gave them a generous three, because they have the ability to be great, they just aren't. 

First, lets start with the pizza.  I've never had it by the pie and if they make their pies from scratch when you order they're probably great.  They make an excellent NY style crust and their sauce is perfect.  They have a number of specialty pies on the menu and a great selection of toppings if you prefer to build your own.

If you're ordering by the slice, you can add any toppings you desire.  They pile them on a pre-made slice of cheese and reheat it in their oven.  Now this is how most NY style pizzerias serve up slices, but there's something about the way  Roman Candle does it that just doesn't turn out right.  I think they overheat them - either when cooking them the first time or when reheating, or both.

On three recent visits to the Willy Street location:

1. I ordered a slice to go.  When I got it home (about a three minute drive) and opened it up I discovered that the cheese was basically rubber.  Definitely overcooked and inedible.

2.  Last week I stopped by for a couple of slices.  I was planning on dining in.  Now, when you walk in there's no information on whether you should seat yourself or wait to be seated.  No one greeted me, so I went to the counter where there were a couple of people ahead of me.  When I was greeted by the woman at the counter she took my order, then when I explained I wanted it for here, told me that they have table service but she took my order there anyway.  I added a tip onto the charge slip, before I had actually received any service - which was clearly a bad idea.

OK, I grabbed myself a cup of water (from the service area, I'm pretty sure) and took a seat.  After waiting at least 20 minutes and seeing the couple that came in after me receive their food I flagged down the waitress and asked if my slices were done.  After mumbling that it was probably taking longer because she had taken my order at the counter she went back to the kitchen and reappeared a moment later with my order in a to-go box.  It had been sitting completed for who knows how long, waiting.  She did ask if I wanted a plate instead of the box since the kitchen had packaged it to-go, but I didn't see the point by then.  One slice was nicely warmed, the cheese still somewhat gooey, while the other was a bit overdone.  Both were a little on the cool side at this point.

3.  A couple of days ago I decided to give them another try.  They're kitty corner from Mother Fool's coffee house, which I love, so I was in the neighborhood again and hungry.  Again when I entered, no one greeted me.  I once again walked up to the counter, hoping to score a seat, but when no server appeared after I few minutes I decided to seat myself.  After waiting in the booth for another few minutes, a server came by to inquire if I was dining in - looking a little confused by my appearance.  Once we got that squared away she was very attentive.  My slice appeared quickly, once again over-done, with the garlic clumped in small mounds across it, not distributed evenly.

I keep wishing the pizza/service could be better - with their crust and sauce they could really shine!  Sadly, that hasn't happened yet."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere in laid back Willy St. Slices are nothing to write home about, but certainly fine. Nice interior and a couple of seats outside. Very very nice wait staff."}
{"text":"When I am hanging with my East side Friends, Roman Candle is a excellent choice for a relaxed and delicious dinner.  I really have not dug deep into the menu.  I usually get the Roman Candle.  It's a spicy sausage and pepper pizza that is not TOO Spicy.  It is so good I just haven't felt like trying anything else.  

But the last time I was there we got the Vegan Destroyer but added cheese.  That was a great pizza.  The Red Pepper Puree was so good!  It added a layer of sweet flavor to an already flavorful pizza.  I would try that one again.  For Sure!

I was with my pals and their baby.  The staff let us take our time, for the most part.  Only rushing us on trying to take our order.  The wait staff could not have know me and my pals were trying to catch up and were not even looking at our menus for the first 20 mins of being there.  I really enjoy this space and the food that they produce."}
{"text":"Welcome to the Near Westside Roman Candle!  Stopped in to see if they were open.    Its so different from the old coffee place that was here before.  Its clean wood and fun patterns on the floor.  Ordered a pizza to go at the bar, ordered a Surley-Coffee Bender, and chatted up the bartenders for info.

Yes, there will be delivery on the future.  Yes, there is a happy hour til 6 Monday to Thursday.  Yes, there are drink specials during the Packer games.  There is a nice bar space and a dining area so find the spot you are comfortable.

Pizza was ready before i finished my beer.  So good!  Im so happy to have a Roman Candle within 15 mins of work and home."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good pizza. Price is OK not inexpensive by any means. They have a good selection of local brews and a great range of selections for toppings."}
{"text":"A disappointing dine-in experience.

We ordered a Supreme pizza with Fireworks sauce.  The Fireworks sauce is a variation on their regular pizza sauce that's a wee bit spicy, and I was looking forward to having it again on our pizza.  Our pizza took an unusually long time (it's a pizza!)  I could tell our server was a little frazzled that the kitchen hadn't gotten out the pizza yet and she apologized for the wait.  When our pizza arrived, I'm 99% sure it did not have Fireworks sauce, as I've had the latter in the past, or that there was just so little sauce I couldn't taste it.  When we paid for the check, the server forgot to ring up the coupon we used.

Overall, we left bummed that we didn't get what we wanted and I'm somewhat discouraged from returning, although I've had decent dine in and delivery experiences in the past."}
{"text":"Great variety of toppings you can't always find. Pesto pizza is awesome. Owner/waitstaff are really great and outgoing. The only problem is the price. Can't go there too often due to that."}
{"text":"The Roman Candle pizza is amazing!! I was a little skeptical of having banana peppers on my pizza but man I've been missing out! The pizza was amazing but the service was as well. I called and made a last minute change due to someone who had an allergy and they were more than accommodating.  Coming from a different state and only having the chains such as Pizza Hut and Papa John's this place blew me away."}
{"text":"My husband and I hit up Roman Candle often when we make it into Madison and the pizza is always great.  Gota love the vegan options!  However, we went to the Willy Street location this week and the waitress had to have been high because she forgot literally everything we asked for, the pizza took forever even though there were only 3 other tables of people, and the kitchen messed up our pizza order.  I don't think we'll be hitting up the Willy Street Roman Candle again."}
{"text":"Madison Pizza Guide:

Cafe Porta Alba --- Pizza Brutta --- Glass Nickel, Roman Candle --- Nationwide chains --- Vomit aged past it's prime -- Toppers

(Takes into account respective styles)

Service leaves something be desired, but I'm more about food than service.

Pizza was average, at best. Cheese, crust and sauce were unexciting.

I think their ingredient list is something like:

Sauce: Tomatoes. 
Cheese: Mozzarella. 
Crust: Yeast, Flour, Water.

The toppings were generally fresh and high quality. Vegetables and meat were tasty, but leagues above the rest of their pizza. Overall, Madison doesn't have a lot of great pizza options. This place is slightly worse than Glass Nickel which isn't spectacular either. Pizza Bruta and Cafe Porta Alba aren't the same style, but still much better in their respective styles."}
{"text":"I'm going with 4 stars. A year ago I would have given it 5 stars, but recently they have taken away my lovely prosciutto and I can't forgive them for that. That was the 5-star topping in my opinion, and the pizza hasn't been as good without it. :("}
{"text":"I hate pizza. And I ate this pizza, it was delicious! We got the Roman candle specialty pizza. The food came quickly, the server was polite, and we will definitely come back. Love that they make everything themselves. And I always love a rootbeer on tap!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gives Glass Nickel a run for its money.  The menu is wide ranging, with an assortment of options, including gluten free.  The pesto/Alfredo blend is probably the best thing I've ever tasted.  It's well worth ordering, especially if you like chicken on your pizza.  The location is great given that it's located in downtown Middleton, so there is plenty of parking.

The service is okay, granted we were there on a Sunday afternoon, so I can see why our server wasn't as enthusiastic about being there.  Still, we will definitely go again."}
{"text":"For anyone who says, doing half and half pizza sauces, as in half margherita and half banana peppers and sausage, is \"weak\", lemme tell you...they're making the pizza in the kitchen. They are under pressure, orders flying in from all different angles, take out here, order in there, medium with extra sundrieds, sub black olives for broccoli add pine nuts, extra sauce...it's no joke. So, that being said, they can't always split a pizza in half because the sauces just don't mix and they gotta cook it and prep and all that jazz.

So, is the pizza good? Yes, hands down, this pizza is really friggin' good. The BBQ chicken is wet my pants good. The Algo Malgo or whatever it is called is truly delicious. 

If you're looking for a quick lunch spot, get your ass in there and enjoy the pizza/salad lunch deal, for it will not disappoint. Order the cheese slice if you like, but since they have the dozens of toppings to choose from, live a little and put some meatballs or eggs or fresh artichokes and make it the way you dream it. 

OVERALL: One of the top pizza place in Madison or Middleton."}
{"text":"On par with Glass Nickel, nice 'fancy' pizza.  Try the Roman Candle: banana peppers, a spicy sauce, and sausage.  Tasty stuff.  Really more things in life should involve banana peppers.

Delivery and eat-in available though I haven't checked out the location yet."}
{"text":"We have been as a family so many times, i figured i was due to write a review. A great place for pizza in a town that has a lot of really good pizza. We always have a great experience with the waitstaff who are usually attentive. They have a good mix of things for kids to keep occupied, which is a plus. Definitely plan to keep visiting here for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience with rude staff. :( I visited for the first time during lunch on a weekday. We walked up to the counter and asked if we could see their slices. She snapped back as us, saying they're not like Ian's. I have never been to Ian's... 

Once we got that all behind us, we ordered a slice from the MENU, and it was pretty fab. The crust was the perfect crispiness, though a little dry, and the sauce had great flavor. Unfortunately, it might take me a while to muster up the courage to give Roman another stab..."}
{"text":"I was told really poor things about this location of the Roman Candle, so after months and months of avoiding this place, my boyfriend decided this was where we were going- and I'm so glad I did!
I dint know what the bad reviews are about. Maybe they had a bad day.
It's a little pricey (but considering the use of local foods it's priced super well!) It tastes great! Even the appetizers are done well,
And dear god they have delicious vegan options so I don't have to sit and watch people eat pizza while I munch on carrots (but the yet here salads are bo NV  and so is the fact that they even OFFER carrots unlike most pizza places!)
So give it a try :) it's super worth it!"}
