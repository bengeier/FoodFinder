{"text":"Great place to get shot not shots.  Closed for years and first night it reopens it hosts a hip hop night and the result is 3 people shot! Avoid! Should lose its liquor license and be shut down."}
{"text":"I saw Mushroomhead here on their second to last night of their spring 2018 tour. I'm not from Cleveland or even from Ohio but I had to come to see MRH in their hometown.   The crowd grew as the night went on. MRH is always a big draw in their hometown. But this is about the venue.   So, beer and booze was comparable to other clubs and music venues. You'll pay about $5 for domestic beers which isn't terrible.  No food but not a big deal here. There is pretty much ZERO seating so don't expect it.  The stage is pretty low and there is no security barrier so you are right up on the action. With that, if you're not used to a metal show where there is pushing, shoving, and moshing, then you may want to stay to the back. For me, it was refreshing not to have security being buzz kills.  There were plenty of kids at the show and they all seemed to have a fun time. There was one kiddo that when the pushing got to be too much, security got him out and over to another family member. Little things like that stay with me.   The location was ok. I didn't park there so I couldn't tell you about the parking situation. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance for pre-gaming or post-show munchies.   I talked to the one Cleveland police officer in the building. He told me that is rarely a problem with metal shows and the area is pretty safe.   Overall, I'm not from the area but I'd come back. For sure."}

{"text":"The worst club i' ve ever seen shows at. The security were the meanest, the sightlines the worst and the seating was....wait! What seating? God forbid you get tired and want to sit on one of the three bar stools for a venue the size of a college basketball arena. I sat on the floor there more times than i can count waiting for crappy openers to wrap up and fade back into obscurity( you opened for Gary Numan). The saving graces were the sorta cool locale at the time in the Flats and actually outstanding performances by Peter Murphy, Eric Burdon and others. It's been closed for some five+ years now. My wife got up on stage and bear-hugged Trent Reznor there, so she may have fonder memories."}
