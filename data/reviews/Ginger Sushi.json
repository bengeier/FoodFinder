{"text":"I've tried ignoring the fact that every time I go there, there are 3-5 staff sleeping on the couches of the restaurant. But this time they even had a sign not to use the door from the parking because the staff were sleeping. Very disappointed. We go once a month for 4 years now."}
{"text":"Under new management. The last time I visited this place, it was still a teppanyaki/sushi joint. 
With so many sushi options in the GTA, it was their groupon that drew me in. This place did not disappoint.

This is the latest sushi joint that adopted the ipad ordering system and have torched sushi. The menu selection is excellent. 

In terms of quality, nothing was bad. Nothing blew my mind either. I have been to so many in the past that it's hard to surprise me with anything new. The fish quality is more or less what you can expect from AYCE place. Their kitchen dishes are quite good. I particularly like their shrimp and \"sauced sashimi\" dishes. 

This place is quite close to home and it's my new go-to place when I crave AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi spot. I only tried the take out so I can't comment on the service. The sushi was fresh and tasted good"}
{"text":"You know those places well.. the ones where they first open, they have amazing customer service and the food is super awesome. Well... sorry, this is not one of them. 


Walked in, wasn't greeted for 3 minutes. And the waitress just said \"wherever you want you can sit\". Ok sure whatever.

Every single item that eventually crawled its way to our table was room temperature... as though they've cooked it ahead of time, let it sit in the kitchen and when they get an order, share some out onto a plate. 


Oh and order more than you need to eat, because they don't end up sending 20 percent of what you ordered. 


Yah I'm going to say, one of the GTA's worst ayce sushi places.



If the owners are reading this, fix the hole in the ship before it sinks itself."}
{"text":"Really good service. Very attentive and the food came very very fast. Wide selection of everything including some dim sum items but no tuna sashimi or seaweed salad which was surprising. The sashimi and rolls were good sizes. 

Nice atmosphere except there weren't a lot of people on a Sunday night so they closed off the inside sections and we were very close to the door which was really chilly. Also there were fruit flies which was annoying."}
{"text":"I remember coming here years ago and it clicked in later that evening why I didn't come back..
We came around 8pm and I guess they were closing soon because the \"cooks\" in the back all came out and had there dinner behind us... kinda strange to have all like 10 staff members eating in the restaurant with you..
The Chinese food was greasy..
A lot of different options to choose from but with that being said.. 
I did not feel good the next day ...
Not going back! 
Dirty restroom..
Not very hygienic looking chefs.."}
{"text":"came for the ala carte dinner and not all you can eat.   Size of the bento is decent.  sushi was not bad at all.  only problem is the tempura sauce taste like salty water.  or very watered down soy sauce.  which was not good.  also, they could have given more teriyaki sauce for the bento.  Service was not great but was not horrible either.  

Choices are not as good as major scarbrough ayce but they have all the basics you would want."}
{"text":"Only been here for the lunch specials but I'm happy with what I've gotten. Service has improved since launch, and they've added iPads for the ayce a few weeks ago. Haven't been here for ayce but I wouldn't hesitate to go based on what I've seen."}
