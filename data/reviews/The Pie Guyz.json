{"text":"I use to go here all the time but our kids were still very young and wouldn't really eat their stuff until this summer we saw their stall at the Brampton's Farmer's Market downtown and grabbed couple of rolls and now the kids love them. 

Nino R below has done an excellent review so I really don't have much to add other then you can also buy un-baked pies and rolls and can take it home and throw them in the toaster oven so they are fresh when you are ready to eat them."}
{"text":"Tiny place with maybe seating for about 6 people.  Will be crowded if more are in there.  Mostly take-out.

I've tried many of their pies and am yet to be disappointed... definitely give them a try if you find yourself in the area.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Delicious pies!! The chicken pot pies are the best I've tried to far!!"}
{"text":"We were in the area for breakfast and got very excited about trying this place.  They advertise that they are open for breakfast at 9.am. but when we went there, we waited 30min past 9 and they were still closed.  Very upset that we wasted our morning on on this place. I will complain further about this."}
{"text":"The butter chicken pie was juicy and moist and the pastry itself is not too dry. Great customer service. Didn't like the lamb curry pie , next time I'll try the vegetarian ones"}
{"text":"Very homely n friendly staff. Tried Curry pie n Pot pie; curry pie is different in taste then Indian curry but is scrumptious!!! Very mellow ambience with good food. 
I only had problem with the way sauces were self served from fridge which could lead up to one using someone else's not so hygiene way of handling them. Individual servings packs would be an ideal way. 
But all in all, loved the experience n recommend to few on my way home."}
{"text":"When I decided to come get some pies after work, I didn't know the location would be so far away!  But when I pulled up and walked in, I knew it was well worth it when I saw the pies on display. The owner was very friendly and we chatted for a bit before leaving. The steak an kidney pie has a perfect crust that's flakey and thick on top, and nicely browned on the bottom. Filling was meaty and not wet, which kept the crust at a great texture, but could have used some more sauce. Easily the best savory pie I've had in Canada so far!"}
{"text":"This morning I was in Brampton for some medical tests that needed to be done.  As I had also been fasting for 12 straight hours, I was starving and in the mood for some heavy breakfast.  I was looking up nearby breakfast places when I remembered that yelp had just sent out a link for a number of Pie places around the GTA.

The Pie Guyz had some good reviews,  So I decided to have pie.  I showed up at 09:30 and they were still setting up the Pie case
I was greeted by this very polite gentleman named Sujeet (owner), after the initial chit chat it was time for me to order some Good Ol' Pie, they have a huge selection of pies, these are single serving 5' pies, and fortunately for me, Sujeet had just brought out a Kitchen bakery rack full of fresh oven baked Pies, Yeeeaaah! I decided to go with the peppered steak Pie, and I've got one word for you, WOW! 

It was warm, flavorful and flaky and just perfect! So I had to get 4 more for later.  Then, the owner informed me that they have a \"buy 5 and the 6th one free\" special and I, of course, jumped on it. 

These are the pies I got and their individual reviews:

Peppered steak Pie-Taste 5/5 and spicy level 0/5 
Steak and Mushroom Pie-Taste 5/5 and spicy level 0/5
Butter Chicken Pie-Taste 4/5 and spicy level 3/5
Chicken Peri Peri -Taste 3.5/5 and spicy level 2.5/5
Curry Lamb Pie-Taste 5/5 and spicy level 4/5
Chicken Vindaloo Pie, I did not taste this one, but the feed back i got was\" very good\"

Overall:
it is a unique and simple ol' fashioned Pie Shop.
It is certified HALAL, for all my Muslim folks
There is a good amount of seating available inside the restaurant
The kitchen is visible, and it was very clean
Fantastic Customer Service and Quality Food


TIP: When you take a Pie home, Puff pastries, anything made with Phyllo dough, or it has a crust, Please, Please, and Please use a Toaster Oven or an actual Oven to heat it up. A microwave destroys pastries, it makes them clammy and soggy.

So go out there, enjoy some pies, also feel free to send me a feed back, and above all, write your own review :)"}
{"text":"The savoury pies from The Pie Guyz are delicious. The pastry is flaky, fluffy and tender; the filling (I had a vegetarian option - spinach and cheese) is tasty. There are lots of options for all palates and dietary restrictions (spicy, vegetarian, chicken, beef, etc.). Great little shop that serves unique and delicious affordable food -- definitely something to check out if you're in Brampton or elsewhere in the GTA."}
{"text":"When I'm missing South African pies I come here. They have a broad range of different flavours. They have an interesting Indian twist on some of the pies, such as tandoori chicken and butter chicken. My favorite is the steak and kidney pie. 

I've tried quite a few pies in Canada and gave up hope that I would find decent pies until I tried out this place. While this isn't quite as good as King pies or the local pies in South Africa, it is definitely worth a try. I'd recommended trying a few different flavours out to see which one you like the best."}
{"text":"This authentic pie shop offers variety of traditional British and some local flavor varieties. From steak and kidney pie to butter chicken pie, they have got it all. And yeah they taste good too. Customer service is great, where the owner isn't shy to share his experiences, tips & techniques and his vision to being the only Pie shop around an area where the clientle might not even have heard of pie's. Highly recommended to walk in and take in the aroma. Would go their again and wouldn't miss a chance to visit to get pie's if am in the area. My go to  place. :) Oh and fyi : i didn't see it but I would like for them to make a Minced meat pie."}
{"text":"Hmm, no clue why I haven't reviewed The Pie Guyz yet. I've been here a handful of times.

I've tried a variety of their pies, which feature a combination of authentic British pies and British pies with an Indian twist. Personally, I prefer pies with a little more kick, so I've been more in favour of the Indian fusion pies.

My personal favourite is the chicken vindaloo. The shopowner will warn you about the spice if you try to order this pie, but don't worry, it's nothing serious - just enough of a kick to be enjoyable.

My other favourites include the peppered steak, steak/mushroom, and the mutton curry.

Not many restaurants of its kind in the GTA, so The Pie Guyz is defniitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Small place but good selection. Unfortunately really poor service. They offer a vegan pie on their website but when I got there the lady had no idea what I was talking about and said they don't have any vegan or dairy free pies. At the time I wasn't a strict vegan so I got four of the veggie option pies to go. Not exactly a comfortable place to dine in. The entire interaction with the employee was unpleasant and unfriendly so unfortunately I would not be back, also a lack of vegan options or knowledge of what vegan is puts me off from coming back here. The vegetarian pie were pretty good though, so I would give. 4.5 star for food and 1 star for service."}
{"text":"They have some pretty good meat pies, but in order to get full you need to order enough that there's just no value. My wife and I had lunch, ordered a few little items between us, and sadly left hungry despite having the experience cost what a filling lunch almost anywhere else would have."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Every pie is fresh and tasty. Very filling. Loved their butter chicken pie"}
{"text":"I've come here once and grabbed a couple pies to go and 4 frozen pies for later. My verdict? If you can go to Kanga Pies (downtown Toronto) instead, go! It's so much better and tastier.

My issue with Pie Guyz was their crust was super soggy at the bottom vs. crunchy. It fell apart when you turned it over. Baking their frozen pies was even more soggy! Kanga's are always crispy and come out perfect from the oven.

I've had a couple flavours from here - the butter chicken, chicken pot pie, steak, and lamb so far. The lamb was the only one that's been flavourful. 

Again, if you're craving savoury pies and can't go too far, this isn't bad. But if you can avoid this place and try some of its more superior competitors in pies (Kanga and The Pie Commission), definitely do so instead.

On the plus side, the owner is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great little spot for your pie cravings. They have a wide selection of traditional English pies and some Indian fusion pies to cater to the local community. I had the chicken vindaloo pie and it was really delicious. Next time I'll try the lamb one!  The owner was super friendly and made sure I enjoyed my meal and even gave some background on the company. I hope they open another location maybe in a mall or more popular area like Heartland so people can find them easier as the location is quite hidden."}
{"text":"Great, cozy place. Great customer service and pies are super crispy. Didn't try too many yet, but I wasn't disappointed. Indian flavours are unique and the Steak and Kidney pie was good. I will be going again."}
{"text":"In a sea of Indian joints, I think Pie Guyz deserve some props for doing something a bit different from everyone else!

It's a small little shop, can't remember if there's even any seating, but as soon as you walk in, you will see pies staring back at you.  Everything is labelled, so there's no guessing games.  

On the left, there are Indian-influenced pies, i.e. Chicken Vindaloo (spiciest), Butter Chicken, Lamb Curry.  And on the right, more British standards, i.e. Steak & Kidney, Potato/Cheese/Onion.  You know, the boring stuff...just kidding!

There are also veggie/kebab roll options as well.  Unfortunately, for those of you who are coming in to satisfy that sweet tooth, you won't find it here.  :(  Prices vary, but they range from $4-5 for a 5\"-ish sized pie.  Great price point for a snack/pre-meal/craving satisfier!

I got the Butter Chicken, which is supposed to be a top seller, and it did not disappoint.  You can tell that the ingredients are fresh, flaky, not frozen.  Nicely seasoned and not too heavily salted.

Tip:  Consume shortly after purchasing.  I ate mine the day-after and I suspect that it was better yesterday 'cause I had to reheat in the micro!

Btw, I wished that Yelp would change the category.  No idea where \"South African\" is from 'cause the dude that I spoke to mentioned nothing about a SA influence!!!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place because my dad has appointments in the medical building closeby. I'm pretty sure I've heard of them before, probably even on tv, though Im not quite sure. 

They offer unusual flavours that I havent heard of in a meat pie, which in itself is nice as you're not stuck with the usual chicken pot pie. The one I got is the chicken peri-peri/piri-piri. The sign for the flavor already warns you that it is mildly spicy, but do take note. It is more than mildly spicy. I would put it as medium (hot-medium-mild-no spice). There's definitely more than a \"little\" kick to it. Get some milk with it to tone down the heat if you dont think you can handle it. The spice factor of it is not troubling much, so the deduction on my rating is mainly for the quality. The pie is dry, simply put. Yes, I know its supposed to be flaky. The odd thing is, there is barely any jus in the pie, yet the bottom was very clammy? Like it all got soaked in. I am not a usual pie eater so I dont have any strong feelings when it comes to eating pie, but maybe other people like it better that way. Who knows. As for me, I dont think I'll be in any rush to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"These pies could have used a bit more salt for seasoning if you ask me but there isn't anything else like this around so I can't complain!"}
{"text":"Took a detour on my way home just to try this after hearing great reviews from my friends-- I wasn't disappointed! 

I came in right when the pies just came out and ordered quite a few different varieties. The service was extremely welcoming and polite and the first pie I tried (Chicken Pot Pie, a classic of course) was delicious. I can't wait to try their other pies!!!"}
{"text":"Came here, & asked owner whats their top seller. And he said, the BUTTERED CHICKEN PIE. Was kind of relactant first so settled with STEAK & MUSHROOM ($5.99) + tax = $6.78

I was expecting a much bigger pie for the value but other than that, the taste did not disappoint! Flaky, warm, and juicy meat. 

After having such a great 1st pie, we decided to buy a BUTTERED CHICKEN PIE for to go. But it didnt really suit my tastebud. Strong flavours of mixed spices. Although the chicken is tender. 

still, loved their British infused pies."}
{"text":"Pies are good and the owner is very friendly 
He is helpful with suggestions especially when its your first time
I have been to pie commission as well and no comparison
This place is great and prices fair but i feel as though the pie is more of a snack
I was hungry after eating two pies still, also the spinach ad cheese was extremely salty couldn't eat it
If your in the area for a quick bite sure, but i dont think id ever crave or hve a reason to return
Food was good but not great
nothing special or different here"}
{"text":"Fast and easy Indian cuisine in traditional English pie style.

You do t want to miss out on one of these pies! Both vegetarian and meat lover options for the whole family. 

I really liked the vegan options and they last really well if you keep them refrigerated. All of the ingredients are fresh and there are no shortcuts in the quality."}
{"text":"This guy knows his pies cooked to perfection I'll be back again. Worth the drive from Whitby"}
{"text":"Walked into this place by accident thinking it was a pizza \"pie\" joint. Well, at first I was quite sad because the food looked good. Right then the owner states that the meat is Halal! Yes folks, halal! That's when my eyes lit up and I wanted to buy one of everything. 

The pie guys are pretty awesome. This place has the small Shepards pie-like dishes but with so many ingredient choices. 

Definitely a must try. Their kabab roll was pretty delicious and the pastry it's wrapped in is so moist and flaky it will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and yummy pies! Found this shop when racking my brain about what to bring in to work to celebrate International Pi Day. It was near closing time but the service was excellent,  gave lots of suggestions and the little pies came with instructions to prepare. The gentleman even gave me an insulated box to take the pies in and keep them warm when I transported it to work the next day. We got the curry veggie, potatoes and cheese and another vegetarian pie. The curry was by far the favourite!  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Jip. Poor selection. I got a pie and a drink for 8 something and I was still hungry after. Its over priced and the pies i wanted were not there so I settled for a random one. The guy is very nice though. Alert od awkward when his wife comes by."}
