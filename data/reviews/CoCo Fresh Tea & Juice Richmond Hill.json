{"text":"Come here at least once every week. I would recommend their pearl milk tea, the 3 guys (grass jelly, egg pudding and tapioca) and their matcha red bean latte.  Their prices are slightly cheaper than Cha time and the alley, which are in the same plaza but it doesn't have places for you to sit. It is take out only."}
{"text":"Had a great experience the first time around. The Pearl Milk Tea is a good alternative to Cha-Time.  I was going to give 4 stars but will downgrade to 3.   Went with some coworkers on a Friday and had two girls in front of us do a mass order of 20. There was only one staff making the tea, with a constant stream of new customers. Ended up waiting over 30 mins for bubble tea.   Great on Monday afternoons. Stay away on Fridays and/or if you see asian office girls/ladies buying for their entire department."}
{"text":"CoCo Tea is the best place to get bubble tea. I've tried so many different places and this is by far the best.   Pros-- 1. You can choose the amount of sugar and ice in your drink. I suggest 30% sugar for a slightly sweet taste that still lets you enjoy the milky tea flavor.  2. There is just the right amount of choices so it's not overwhelming. 3. The bubbles have the right amount of chewiness. 4. Everything is clean and fresh.  5. Great prices. A regular size is about $4."}
{"text":"a great alternative for the plethora of bubble tea chains all over the GTA.  the classic drinks are delicious and I haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"Really good bubbletea! Came here because our friends recommended it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day and really loved it. The tapioca is really fresh and the original milk tea had a lot of great flavour. It was $5.10 including tax for a large bubble tea. The time I went, ~12pm on a weekday wasn't busy at all. The other reviewers are right though, when they say there isn't much room in the store. The staff were polite and greeted us as soon as we came in and made our drinks pretty quickly. If you have a vicinity card it's a good idea to use it here, or sign up for one in-store."}
{"text":"Have started coming here in the last couple of weeks. Definitely better than Chatime. Chatime taste like sugar water to me. Service is also pretty quick, even when there are a lot of people inside. Only downside to this location is that it seems like there's less pudding in thr \"2 ladies\" drink compared to other locations."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of bubble tea besides the rare caramel milk tea I get from cha time, but CoCo has changed my opinion. CoCo is located at commerce gate where all the other BBT places are and although the parking lot for the plaza is almost always full, there's always a spot available near CoCoz  Recently, I felt like I lost my love for bbt but when I tried my girlfriends drink (sago milk tea), it rekindled my fire with bbt. The tea itself wasn't too sweet and was extremely flavourful but my favourite part was the sago. I don't think I'd ever go to tapioca after trying sago, but I really think it's just personal preference.   Service is usually good, I'm not waiting too long for my order to be ready but the place is a little of small. I come back here often and would recommend it. Would definitely recommend coming and especially trying the sago if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"This has become my favourite place for bubble tea! I love that they have sago as an option. I have tried all the places like it in the area and it is now my number 1 place to go. I would recommend everyone try it!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Coco...  Lately I've been preferring Coco over Chatime. I've tried a few drinks here and so far my favs are the Sago Taro (less ice, 30% sweet) and lemon king (less ice, 30% sweet). The sago taro tastes like you're having a \"sai mai lo\" - the chinese tapioca dessert minus the coconut taste in drink form. The lemon king is super refreshing and would definitely be a good choice come the summer months.   The only downside here is that its just a takeout location. No seating available.   Follow their instagram for weekly/monthy promotions!"}
{"text":"From being my second choice to Chatime in the same plaza, Coco's has become my number one priority. Hot damn.   Yes, their store is smaller than Chatime's but if you take away the extra space allotted to seating at Chatime, it's relatively the same size. I'm good with that. There is a promotion for Bubble Gaga at $3.50 for a large size. DOWN. It was so good and so fast... Again, compared to Chatime. New fave bubble tea place at Commerce Gate."}
{"text":"This plaza has some fierce competition when it comes to bubble tea. And yet Coco is becoming one of my favourite bubble tea places to go to!  If you check-in at this location, you get a 1 free topping so definitely check in to save some money!   This location is very small. There are no seats or tables to sit down so definitely not a good place to chill at with your friends.   I tried the grass jelly milk tea and it is great. I love the taste of the tea and the customization but every bubble tea place offers that nowadays. If you have a vicinity rewards card, make sure to tap your card too!"}
{"text":"Cocos is one of my favourites of all the tea places. Lots of options and they are almost always running promotions.   This is a new location in a very busy plaza (which also has a Chatime and Teashop 168). It's on the smaller side (no seating). Service seemed friendly. The parking situation in this plaza can be a nightmare though."}
{"text":"Tried the panda, and it's good. Other drinks that we pressed were good. Texture of the boba is good."}
{"text":"Small CoCo location with no seats. The staff are friendly--they even humored me when I asked to buy a box of tapioca! (It's hard to find large quantities, okay?) The drinks come out at a slow pace though, so prepare to stand around for a bit (although I find most CoCo locations like this). The drinks themselves are pretty consistent with other CoCo locations.  We tried the new avocado pudding with milk drink and I've got to say, I was really surprised. It has the very mild avocado flavour and the smoothness, but it tastes like a dessert? The flavour is hard to describe and really unique from what I've tried before--but I quite enjoy it! It's definitely quite filling so maybe on get the avocado drinks if you're feeling hungry or had a small meal."}
{"text":"CoCo is now one of my favourite bbt shops in the GTA! When it comes to bbt shops, I don't have one specific favourite, as I go to different shops for different drinks depending on my mood. I love the wintermelon tea at Gong Cha, and the roasted milk tea at Chatime. What stands out to me at CoCo are their fruit drinks. I have tried the Mango Smoothie and Bubble Gaga, and absolutely loved both! So any time I'm craving a fruit tea, I will be going to CoCo.  However, the one negative of this shop is that it is tiny. Both times that I've visited, the lines were out the door. And once you have placed your order, you'll be squished in the tiny space inside the store waiting with all the other customers."}
{"text":"Two Ladies Two Ladies Two Ladies  Two Ladies  Two Ladies  Two Ladies Two Ladies  Two Ladies   Did I mention Two Ladies?  Coco has taken over from Chatime as my go to bbt place. Their milk tea is creamier and tastier than Chatime. Also, they are very fast!  Make sure you get a Vicinity card for loyalty membership!"}
{"text":"The price is decent and each one is so full so you'd be careful when you open it. Since the presotea is closed, this one become my first choice. Good service and the milk tea has a lot of tea flavor. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Drinks- I personally like the milk tea at Coco compared to Chatime. In my opinion, definitely get the three guys or the Taro slush. Ambiance- Unfortunately there are no seats at the store. Service- Pretty normal.  Value- Worth the price."}
{"text":"Coco Fresh Tea & Juice, in general, is a pretty good bubbletea franchise - I'd place it on par or slightly above the likes of Chatime.    Personally, I've tried 3 Guys(milk tea w/ tapioca, pudding, grass jelly), 2 Ladies (milk tea w/ pudding and tapioca), and the normal milk tea w/ tapioca.  This particular location (Commerce Gate) doesn't have any seating - it functions solely as a takeout place, which puts it at a disadvantage against the Chatime right around the corner which has ample seating; however, if you're just looking to pickup a quick drink then it's perfectly fine.  The staff here were nice and efficient, so props to them after a long opening day.  Take home message when craving bbt and around Commerce Gate: Chill w/ friends = Chatime Takeout = Coco"}
{"text":"I'm no bubble tea connoisseur, but I absolutely love CoCo and definitely think it's one of the best places to get bubble tea in the GTA. I recently tried this place for the first time when the new location at Commerce Gate opened up, and man have I been missing out.  I've tried a few flavours so far, but my favourites would be the Taro Sago and the 3 Guys (Original Milk Tea with Tapioca, Grass Jelly, and Pudding). My drinks are always made fresh and the toppings consistently taste great - unlike most of the other bubble tea places I go to where the tapioca/grass jelly are sometimes a bit off. I also feel like the drinks are a bit sweeter than usual here, so I'd recommend getting less sugar.  P.S. I'm an Elite Chatime member, and it has always been my personal favourite when it comes to bubble tea. But ever since I've had CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice, things have changed... I've chosen CoCo over Chatime every time for the past month. I love it here! I wish there were seats/tables inside this location instead of just take out though."}
{"text":"I ordered a large red bean matcha milk tea this evening. The service is usually great but not this time. The red bean that they gave me was just a teaspoon full. I asked the guy if that is right and he said they measure it using the first line at the bottom  of the cup but it did not even reach the first line. I remember when I order the same drink before I get a lot of red bean but not this time."}
{"text":"Bubble tea is great, service is a little slow as the store opened LITERALLY two days ago."}
{"text":"Bought 2 drinks during their promotion. Cashier told me I couldn't collect vicinity points for them as they are are part of the special deals? The next time I went to Coco I ordered promotion drinks but collected Vicinity points so I'm confused. I think Coco should still give the points being a loyal customer and what not. My Go-To is definitely 2 Ladies, I love their tapioca and tea flavour."}
{"text":"I love Coco and am in love with it even more ever since I discover sago recently. I've been drinking boba for 10 years+ now and couldn't believe what I had missed out. Now my go to drink at coco is milk tea with grass jelly and sago.  Other recommendations: Mango Yogurt Slush Tropical drink (I don't remember the exact name)"}
{"text":"Maybe my taste buds are shot from all the msg I consume it maybe the smoke is finally getting to me. Coco was hyped so much as being blessed and falls to being meh  Yakult bubble teas make me go sploosh. Yakult makes everything better, shakes, smoothies, your gfs mom. Incredibly Coco messes up the beauty that is Yakult bubble tea. The mango Yakult drink lacked flavour. There were burbs of mango and a waft of Yakult. I was expecting a nice tangy flavour of cultured yogurt drink. All I tasted was disappointment  Much faster service than the chatime beside and comparable but not better. Great if you want to get a drink before hell freezes over *glares at chatime Richmond hill"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I got a large matcha milk tea with tapioca, half sweet and light ice. It tasted good; however, it was still very sweet and tasted too much like milk (I know it's a MILK tea but at 50% sweet, it should be less concentrated). Next time, I should get 30% or 20%. Also, as I said it tasted too much like milk because I could barely taste the matcha/green tea (if any) flavour. Seriously, I thought they gave me milk tea, but my drink was green. If you set those things aside, the drink was overall very good! The tapioca pearls were perfect! Very chewy and had a nice caramel/maple syrup flavour on its own, probably the best tapioca pearls I've ever had in bubble tea! The amount of pearls was also very generous.   Service was good and very quick. Nice décor inside.   Overall, I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love all their bubble tea especially the Taro Sago with less ice and no sugar. The service is always great here."}
{"text":"I love Coco drinks, but my experience recently has not been great.   Pros:  - Wait times: Almost every time I've gone, there is usually no line or the drinks are made very quickly.  - Parking: As long as you don't go during peak hours, there is usually parking at Commerce Gate. Keep in mind though that the plaza has tons of other desserts or restaurants.  - Selection: There is so much selection on the menu from milk teas to fruity drinks to hot beverages.   Cons: - Service: I was really disappointed with the service I got the other day. I ordered a Jasmine Milk Tea with Grass Jelly. When the drink came out, it looked all like 2% milk and grass jelly. I was trying not to be a downer and tried it anyway. It tasted like 2% milk and when I had my friends tried it, they also agreed like only 2% milk. I asked the server if she could remake it because Jasmine milk tea has the taste of jasmine but she said no. This is very annoying when you've ordered this before and you know what it tastes like, but it wasn't made correctly. I would say this is not consistent amongst all chains.   Drinks I love: - Lemon King: Great refresher if you love lemon drinks! They put a whole lemon inside, it is so refreshing. My favourite drink there.  - Bubble Gaga: This one is pretty sweet so I personally get 50%-80% sugar but great if you are craving passion fruit tea with coconut jelly and tapioca.  - 3 Guys: Great milk tea option if you are craving for tons of toppings as well. It comes with tapioca, grass jelly and pudding.  Overall, I had a bad experience on my part. I will probably just go to other locations instead or another shop instead of this one."}
{"text":"Really small location with no places to sit but as always, Coco Fresh was delicious and staff was great :)"}
{"text":"I like this Coco Fresh. They made my 2 ladies drink perfectly. Btw 2 ladies is milk tea with pudding and tapioca.   I also like their lemon iced tea and winter melon tea. I find their teas very refreshing and fresh tasting. Great way to quench the summer thirst!   Prices are about 5.5 for a large, on par with other bubble tea places."}
{"text":"CoCo is arguably Chatime's biggest competitor, as there seems to be one not too far away from where you are if you're in the GTA. While I'm a diehard Chatime fan, I decided to give CoCo a try since a friend I was with insists on CoCo over Chatime.  The place is quite small and can get quite crowded, especially when I was there on a Saturday night. The employees inside are efficient, fortunately, and I got my drink in less than 20 minutes.  I had the tapioca chocolate, with less ice and 50% sugar. It definitely felt like less ice and sugar, to the point where the chocolate taste was more \"cocoa\"-y, which I personally like better. While the prices are similar to Chatime, the sizes seem larger here, so you get more bang for your buck.  My parents have the Vicinity card for CoCo and have been diehard CoCo fans as well...so it's a good chance that I'll return (although I might try another CoCo branch)."}
{"text":"Coco's has been one of my favourite bubble tea shops. The Richmond Hill location at Hwy7/Commerce Gate is a smaller store. This place has no chairs or tables; it is meant as a store for pickup and to-go orders.   I got the Pearl Milk Tea (large) with less ice and 30% sugar. I find that the sweetness is overwhelming if you don't ask for a reduced sugar level. The drink came to about $6, which is about the price of many other milk tea places. I'd recommend this place for those who just want to pick up a drink to go."}
{"text":"I've been to CoCos many times to satisfy my bubble tea cravings - and they never disappoint! Of all the bubble tea places in Commerce Gate, CoCo manages to capture with their price and taste of their unique milk tea.   My favourite is their Three Guys which is their milk tea with tapioca, pudding and grass jelly ($5.30 for reg size). I'm pretty indecisive with my toppings so this option is perfect for me since I can get 3 toppings with no separate additional charge. They also have the Two Lady which is their milk tea with tapioca and pudding ($4.80 for reg size - in case you're not a fan of grass jelly).   Like all the other bubble tea chains, you have the ability to customize the ice level and sugar level. All in all, would I come back? Yes!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here a lot more frequently over the past year and I've been enjoying Coco. The drinks are better made than when I previously reviewed. The staff at this location are still very friendly and I can't remember the last time they got our drink order wrong. Will continue to alternate between Coco and Chatime when I'm in this plaza."}
{"text":"Love CoCo, hate this location.  I have decided to stop coming to this location altogether as the staff are incompetent and can barely understand English! CoCo Ontario had a spin the wheel promotion over the holidays to get free upsize, free toppings, etc.... tried to use it at this location...staff were completely unaware of this and did not know how to apply it.. ended up telling me that I cannot use it.  More recently, came by to order a few drinks.. ordered a \"Sago Mango Green Tea\" and the cashier punched in \"Sago Milk Tea\"... I obivously did not notice and proceeded to pay. When picking up my drinks.. realized it was wrong.. told the staff. The 3-4 staff there all looked at us and the young Asian female cashier with broken English started to raise her voice at us, going full out with accusations, with \"you ordered this. I repeated the order to you 2 times\".. she could barely speak English..nevermind repeat my order with 3 drinks twice.   Soooo instead of offering to remake the drink (cost to make these drinks is SO low...and takes a minute... c'mon)... or apologize for their mistake..the entire staff just stood there and stared at us blankly.  Contacted CoCo Ontario via Facebook and got a \"we take this issue very seriously\" email.. yeah right!  There are tons of other bbt stores around that can have my business from now on :)"}
{"text":"Good location and exposure. The shop is pretty small, with no tables to sit and enjoy your bubble tea. It's an order and take-out type of place. Parking is tight in that area of the Commerce Gate plaze, so I had to do a 2 minute walk from elsewhere in the plaza to get here, which isn't bad. Exercise! It was my first time trying Coco, and it didn't disappoint. I tried their $3.88 special, which lasts until May 15: a Medium \"2 Ladies\" which was basically black milk tea with egg pudding and tapioca. It had a rich aroma, and tasted great coupled with the egg pudding. Their other promo lasting until May 15 is a Lemon King cup, also for the same price. Regular price for a medium 2 Ladies is $4.50. To be honest, I like Chatime's rich taste better, but Coco definitely ranks above 168.   The cashier was super friendly and patient! It was my first time here so I was a bit clueless, as no other tea place names their drinks \"ladies\". She helped me navigate sugar and ice portions (which I ultimately decided to keep normal since it was my first time here and felt like I had to try the original as a baseline reference) and offered me a bag for my 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Coco's milk tea is good, but at this location there are far too many competitions and it does not stand out. Much prefer the alley or preso that are in the same plaza. The milk teas are a bit too sweet (even with reduced sugar) and the tea taste is just not strong enough. On the bright side they are fast and always has promos going on!"}
{"text":"I like this coco, because it's consistent with ever other coco. They don't taste any different then any other coco. My favourite drink at coco is the bubble gaga, they use real fruit. Which makes it taste so much better. I find with the fruit drinks if I do no sugar. It's perfect for me."}
{"text":"Tea based is very strong and flavourful. I would say CoCo has the best Milk Tea among all the Bubble Tea Chains. We always order the 3-guy (Grass jelly, Tapioca, pudding).   The service was pleasant and quick in this location. This location is a take-out only."}
{"text":"Great bubble tea. Unique flavours and toppings in comparison to chattime. Would highly recommend the taro with sago (but if you don't like small balls, get tapioca). Would also recommend the bubble gaga for their green tea drinks if you don't like milk. The two ladies and 3 guys is also a great hit. Good flavours but very different to compare the two big bubble tea joints in the plaza (Chat time and The Alley). Overall good bubble tea joint, I keep coming back for cravings!"}
{"text":"Coco's milk tea is the best among other chains but unfortunately not at this location. Ordered 3 Guys today and was quite disappointed. The milk tea is not the best that I had in comparison to the Yonge-Finch location. Tea and milk ratio is not very well-balanced. I also tried Bubble Gaga here and it tasted like sugar water. I was wondering why because this is one of their best sellers. It should not taste like just sugar water...   I don't think I would come back to this location. Given the number of bubble tea shops around, I would rather go try them out."}
{"text":"CoCo Fresh Tea & Juice is one of the four BBT places at Commerce Gate. Talking about competition! Is it ready for competition?  CoCo has some good solid drinks that I like and I found their flavour more intense and I do enjoy their more interesting combination of drinks. But this location is definitely at a disadvantage as being a takeout place only.   The fact that if they going to offer promotional specials on some of the drinks might help to bring in business as Chatime hardly have any specials. I might pick up something to try at $3.50 for a large.  So no Vicinity Points on promotions? I hope the head office would get it straight as it seems to have no standard on royalty program as it really depends on the locations or who is serving you?"}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Coco! Haha. Living beside this plaza with literally every bubble tea has turned me into a BBT connoisseur. Every tapioca topping will not go unnoticed. Coco is probably my favourite out of the major bubble tea players because the quality is great.   At this location, the milk tea in general is delicious and addicting. My favourite is sago milk tea and sometimes two ladies. They always have specials, cool promotions (red pockets from CNY anyone?), and reasonably priced. They are most similar to Chatime in terms of flavour.   The service is also quite good. They are nice and prompt with their service. Unfortunately this is a small takeout store so there's no seating or ambience, but I would still definitely recommend this Coco!"}
{"text":"I normally come here if I want to switch it up from going to Chatime or The Alley and when I do the service is consistently fast. As well, the drinks are also made according to my order. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Working in the area, I've tried almost all the BBT stores at Commerce but CoCo is my ultimate favourite and I will choose it over the other ones in the plaza. The average drink is about $5.00 which is standard (and cheaper than Alley in the same plaza).   I think this is the smallest CoCo I've ever been to but they are fast in prepping your drinks so it works out. There is no seating at this location. Service is always great here and they don't mind having to look up my phone number if I don't have my Vicinity card on me (I've had someone tell me they can't do that before at another BBT store).  My go-to drinks are either the Sago Milk Tea or the Taro Sago Milk Tea if I'm feeling for something more sweet. I dislike tapioca but I enjoy having sago in my drink. The milk tea is very smooth - just the way I like it.  Note that it can be hard to find parking in this plaza, especially during lunch hour and dinner time. I prefer to walk over with my coworkers on my lunch."}
{"text":"This is my 'local' coco tea! It's the one I come to the most.  Location: In Commerce Gate in Markham   Parking: Commerce gate parking can be nuts. Some people don't realize that there is also underground parking. You can park underground and pop up   Decor: It's a right in right out! There are no chairs just a counter to order. When you go, it's to grab a drink and leave. I like that. There's never a big line up, it's pretty steady. You come grab your drink and leave.   The Goods: I've tried quite a few drinks. My favourite is the king lemon. Green tea with a whole lemon  in it.  I also enjoy the bubble gaga- passion fruit with coconut jelly and tapioca balls. My friend is crazy over the milk teas. Right now they are advertising the creme drinks. I've been trying the creme series which I'm liking too! Watch for pictures!  Staff: Everyone is really nice!!"}
