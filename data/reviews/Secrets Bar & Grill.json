{"text":"Best and BIGGEST Fish fry around!!! Also, it's temporally Smoke Free with a outside heated smoking area! Pulling out all the stops!"}
{"text":"This place deserves some reviews...great ones! We ordered take out and I have to say it was delish. Not just your regular bar food. My grilled chicken salad was tasty and fresh. The potato salad, slaw and Philly Cheese Steak were some of the best anywhere. Philly has got a run for their money with this one!
With friendly service and superb management, Secrets is a must go to. Don't walk, run to this neighborhood joint!"}
{"text":"Great place, friendly people and atmosphere nothing fancy great food and music had an awesome time and they aimed to please"}
{"text":"What a bunch of pukes how can you put so disgusting pictures up of 3 guys 1 giving the middle finger. Should reconsider this pics. Bad adverting!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a beer and when they have live music it's guaranteed to be good. When it gets really busy though, it's like sitting in a hot-boxed car, the amount of smoke in unreal. I would highly recommend that the owner get a new or additional smoke eater. I would recommend this place to people who wouldn't mind getting lung cancer or emphysema."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood dive bar. There is no real parking lot.  Smoking IS allowed.  It is located in the middle of a residential area.  I entered and sat down at the bar.  No one was behind the bar.  After waiting 5 minutes and not being served, I left."}
{"text":"This is the roadie dive bar my backstage dreams are made of. 
We went there in full blown winter, snow everywhere and it was still rocking, people make an effort to come out even in the worst weather. 
Our Uber driver wasn't sure that we were going to a bar as it is hidden like the best secret you were ever told.
Owned by touring guys, you will be sure to hear the best stories while playing pool or singing along to the jukebox. 
I haven't even gotten to the food they serve there- i WISH that i lived closer, just to have another crack at their Philly cheese steak--yes, I know this is in Pittsburgh, but a Philly native is running the joint, so it's legit, and it's INCREDIBLE. It should be illegal, it's so good- 
Heard their Superbowl party was off the charts, they don't skimp on the favors. 
Ask for Matt or Jon, tell 'em Kitty sent you-- you will be in heaven."}
{"text":"Ok. You need to know that the best Philly Cheese Steak is actually in Pittsburg.
This is the best Cheese Steak I have ever had, and I've had a lot. Order the smoked Gouda cheesteak (it's not on the menu) and prepare for a serious FIO.
Next time I'm in Pitts I will be back.
Great staff and just a cool, out of the way local bar."}
{"text":"This bar is always playing my favorite song for some strange reason.  Had the pleasure of meeting the owners & I have to say , they are super down to earth.  Matt came by and mentioned he was from Philly so that explains the amazing food , especially the Cheese steak!  Also when I spilled a drink all over myself then didn't hesitate to get me a new one even though it was my own fault. What can I say, sometimes I'm a real mess!! This place feels like home & is my go to - make uber get the directions right so you get here & get home safely!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with good food, music, and employees! One of my favorite dive bars!"}
