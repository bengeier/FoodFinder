{"text":"Black Forest has been a local secret forever for excellence in steaks. Garlic bread and cheese is also recommended. I think they make their own crunchy dill pickles. Salads are just plain but fresh. You want a great  steak this is the place"}
{"text":"This steakhouse has seen better days I'm sure.  The interior is dark, drab and could use a restaurant makeover...too bad it's been cancelled. I loved that show.  I can totally see Igor taking a sledge hammer to this place and having a blast.  

There's a good selection of steaks on the menu and it's relatively inexpensive compared to some other steakhouses.  Steak diane caught my eye and I'm still thinking about it now.  The steak was cooked to my liking, medium rare (the best way served and anything more than medium cooked is a travesty imo) and the \"special sauce\" which looked a little daunting because it reminded me of something you would find after a night of binge drinking (we've all been there, you know what I'm talking about), was absolutely delicious. Mixed in with some saut√©d mushrooms it was good eats.  Steamed asparagus, chef's salad, rolls and fries rounded out the rest of the meal.  Very satisfied afterwards & will be a regular now that I've discovered this great unassuming restaurant."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and this place never disappoints! Went for a late Valentine's day dinner. We both ordered the 16 oz striploin medium rare and they came out perfect.  You're served pickles to start and we said yes to garlic cheese bread thinking it was complimentary. It wasn't. But not too upsetting as it's only $5. They're prices are unbeatable. It's a family run business that's been around for awhile. The decor is a little dated but still very cozy. Highly recommend this little gem in the heart of Scarborough. Warning though of you don't like garlic ask if it's in your food as they love it. (SO DO I)"}
{"text":"This place has been there forever and it has not change one bit!.  It is like stepping into a time machine back to the 70's.  But the steaks are good and the little old lady that servers you is nice and friendly.  They serve the steak on wooden cutting boards which are so worn that I believe they are originals from the 1960's On my birthday she gave me a free cheesecake slice to take home.  When I opened the box it was almost half a cake!.  I suggest you try it out before it is too late.

be warned - they are closed on sundays."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been going regularly with my best friend for the past several years. He's been coming to Black Forest since childhood with his parents. 
It's simple and delicious fare. I always enjoy either the 8oz or 12oz filet, perfectly seasoned, cooked blue and super juicy. 
They have the most delicious cheesy garlic bread around and the mushrooms are the bees knees. 
It's a very old fashioned interior but clean and warm and the owners and staff treat you like family."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked medium rare T-Bone steak. Caveman portion size. Delicious food and reasonable prices. Best service ever!"}
{"text":"Old style Steak house....Moved into area and thought we'd give this place a try. It's reminiscent of seniors at y and St Clair...the old school steak house...kitschy decor etc...

We had a very enjoyable evening. The rib steak was amazing...huge portion and perfectly spiced and grilled. Crisp iceberg house salad...dill pickles, garlic bread with Greek cheese (the saganaki type). Very yummy. 

Tula our waiter who has worked there for years was charming and treated us well. 

Will definitely go back....

The wine list was limited we felt."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and will continue to return as they make delicious steaks! As others have said the decor is dated but it gives character. The garlic cheese bread is the best and they make their own dill pickles. Steaks are always served on wooden cutting boards with your potato on the side. They are also served with a fresh salad, their house creamy garlic dressing is so yummy!

They have a full service bar and Tula, the hostess and waitress is classic. She shares stories of her time coming to Canada and she really makes you feel like you're at home. 

The prices are very reasonable and the steaks are always so juicy and perfectly seasoned. Definitely give this place a chance, it's a hidden gem that only locals know about but will treat everyone as family."}
{"text":"Best steak restaurant period. It's a bold statement but you will know what I mean once you try it. Yes it has 70s decor but the prices are from 70s too. They recently increased their prices but a 12 oz perfectly cooked new york strip still only costs $25 which is a steal as it is super high quality (sterling silver brand which I believe is a premium cut). It's perfectly juicy and seasoned and the meat just melts in your mouth good. It comes with all the fixings like salad and your choice of rice pilaf, baked potatoes or fries. They offer a killer garlic bread costs extra but they are so good! 
The old lady her name is Tula and just a great character, chatty, funny, a grandma type for sure. 
This place is a hidden gem in scarborough and if you love steak you gotta try it. My husband and I love steak and we tried so many steak places including high end ones like Harbour Sixty but we always get disappointed and now we don't even bother trying when we have a sure winner that is also very reasonably priced."}
