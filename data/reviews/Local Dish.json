{"text":"AMAZING!!!!!  We both ordered the chicken and waffles which were unbelievable!  Great service, excellent food, and best of all is that it's a small local farm to table restaurant.  Can't wait to go back!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to the local dish the day after Christmas and were excited to find the restaurant not too crowded. We have been to local dish many times and my parents were excited to take a relative in town to the restaurant. After telling the hostess that we had 5 in our party she informed us that we had to wait 20 minutes for a table when there were four empty 4-top tables next to each other that could easily be put together. She said they couldn't put the tables together and that we would have to wait. We were all a little dumbfounded at the ridiculous policy that basically just turns away business. We ended up going elsewhere where we were seated immediately and had a great lunch. Customers beware - either kill off your fifth family member or be ready to wait until the one larger table is available."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! We've been trying to get a table for a few months and we finally did. I was very impressed with the service and the food was simply amazing! We will be back again soon. There were too many delicious options on the menu not to."}
{"text":"love the food here. always fresh and has a very relaxed decor. just wish there was more tables and space to eat. Also could use some new options on the menu."}
{"text":"Local Dish has excellent food and the service was outstanding.  We will definitely be regular customers"}
{"text":"All our food was so good.  The Ribeye was one of the best, maybe the best, steak I've had.  The staff was very friendly also."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and good tasting. I had the fried green beans, spinach salad with local green apples & a roasted vegetable sandwich & a strawberry iced roll desert. Highly recommended if your in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very flavorful. Great service! So nice to have a wonderful local spot :)"}
{"text":"Love the food.  Been a couple times and nice quiet place with a great meal.  Servers were very friendly every time I have been."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend the other night. What a welcome spot to have in Ft Mill!  Service was great. Pork nachos were some of the best I've ever had.  For dinner I had the pot pie and it was wonderful.  Nice fresh puff pastry and the filling was wonderfully creamy and rich with lots of fresh veggies.  My friend had the salmon which she raved about.  We split a warm blueberry cobbler for dessert- simple and perfect.. Not too sweet so you could really taste the fruit. I had zero complaints.. Great food and reasonable pricing in an enjoyable setting.  My friend noted that they could use to add a couple more mid-range wines but other than that she's happy! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Unexpected find in Fort Mill, SC!   Everything we ordered was AMAZING.   Definitely coming back here again for special occasions."}
{"text":"One of the first restaurants I ever visited upon moving down to SC. Local Dish sources high quality ingredients and has a farm to table appeal. Decently priced and the meals I've had definitely do not disappoint! This is the type of small town local joint that you just don't see anymore. A must try!"}
{"text":"Very good place. Excellent and inspiring menu. Local sourced fresh ingredients. Better than other high end food restaurants who claim fresh food. Have been there back to back. Love this place and would go there when I am in the area.   On the downside it is busy for lunch as more  people are loving it and reasonably priced. Little louder as it is open food court seating. Hope they continue to grow without losing their niche."}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous! Shrimp and Grits.  Pan seared scallops. Pulled pork sandwich.   And the table favorite,  chicken pot pie with a flaky crust. Yum.   Dessert _ doughnut bread pudding. Don't try to figure it out.  Just come and enjoy!"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 stars.  Everything sounded great, but did not meet our expectations.  Pimento fondue app was good, but nothing special.  I think the crostini overpowered the dip.  I had the meatloaf.  It was a little dry and bland.  The sides (collards and mushroom risotto) were great, though.  I think the risotto is one of the best I ever had...so creamy.  My husband had the shrimp and grits and thought it was good.  Overall, a good meal."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I have been waiting forever to try this place, we only heard great reviews. They did not disappoint. Environment is casual, but food reminds me of something that I've paid twice for at other places."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best place to eat in the area. The food is always fresh and cooked perfectly, and the service is always impeccable even during a busy lunch rush. Absolutely delicious pork belly, it practically melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"The Local Dish is one of the few, if not the only sit down restaurant in downtown Fort Mill. Due to this, The Local Dish is always full at lunch time.  The food is ok, but the restaurant is significantly overpriced. For the type and quality of meals, the price should be similar to a Waffle House. $37 for a chicken pot pie and chicken & waffles with two waters is outrageous. Could have gone to Chik-Fil-A and gotten the same for $20."}
{"text":"DO NOT GET THE PBT.. It is PURE jello pig belly fat.. I didn't read the description fully and sunk my teeth into the fatty jello lard. Oh god. It's no good."}
{"text":"We were just passing through and were lucky enough to find this pretty little South Carolina gem.  Inventive and fresh but not fussy comfort food locally sourced, some local bottled beers, and smiling, prompt service!  A great choice for the traveler looking for an authentic experience, and well worth the highway detour!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Our waiter Kyle was very knowledgable and pleasant.  The manager Adam even came to our table to check on us. My favorite is the crispy spinach!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit. Pulled pork nachos were a big hit. My current favorite nachos. Pot pie wasn't a great hot weather choice so will take some ownership here. I'd say we liked it a lot but didn't love it. Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Do your face a favor, come eat here. Our family came in for dinner: oldest daughter got the pimento grilled cheese and our 2 picky eaters devoured the chicken and waffles. I went for the meatloaf and my wife got the salmon. The mushroom risotto that came with the meatloaf was utter perfection. I'm not even usually a fan of mushrooms. Perfect collards as well. Everything very fresh, very delicious. Only small complaint from oldest was a little too much cheese on the grilled cheese... Overall, HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after hearing many great reviews. It definitely lived up to the hype! We were greeted and seated immediately. Luckily we went on a week night and somewhat later than usual. Still, there were several tables eating and a few patrons at the little bar. The server was amazingly sweet and extremely knowledgeable about each and every dish. Her enthusiasm for the food, ingredients and preparation of the dishes was so refreshing. We both ordered waters, which she kept refilling throughout our meal. After reading several reviews referencing the \"amazing\" green bean appetizer, we went with that. Wow. I don't know what was in the seasoning or very light batter, but simply great! Decent portion for two. My boyfriend ordered the chicken pot pie for his entr√©e. I found myself in a dilemma in determining what to choose among three dishes and asked the server for her recommendation. She indicated that the Shrimp Pasta was her menu favorite and considering it was on my short-list, ordered that. The food came out fast and H-O-T! The chicken pot pie was so hot that even after several minutes, was still steaming. The server offered to take it and have it poured into a larger bowl to allow it to cool faster (very attentive and accommodating). The pot pie was superb. My dish was the Shrimp Pasta...or, what I will refer to as my new favorite pasta dish! So fresh and full of good low-country, shrimp/tomato seafood boil type flavor. It was pretty much, perfect! We both CLEANED our plates. Healthy portions of food too! I can't even believe that I ate that much pasta, but the super flavorful, but not heavy sauce kept the dish light. Highly recommended! Already looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food!  Best wings I have ever had!  The pulled pork nachos are so yummy!So glad we found this local Resturant in downtown Fort mill!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for dinner. Hummus is yum.  Scallops were mouth watering.  Go."}
{"text":"John, et al, I must tell you, we are local regulars but we brought our out-of-town guests in this past Fri night.  The wife is from Shreveport, LA.  She said she has not had a better shrimp po boy outsidet the State of LA.  I am so proud.  Good job.  See you again soon!"}
{"text":"One of the best little spots in Fort Mill to eat. Their menu is diverse for all taste preferences. With simple combinations but wonderfully complex flavors. Haven't been disappointed yet. Ask for vegetablenor a soup of the day, haven't had a bad day yet."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and recommend it. The value, quality to price ratio, is very high for the food and it is just a relaxed place. I have only been there for lunch but bet dinner is also great. Glad to see Fort Mill is growing a food scene."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know what the food is like as we drove across Charlotte to eat here only to learn the kitchen was closed an hour before the time stated. The time on Yelp, Google, and the door all stated 10, but we were turned away at the door shortly before 9:30. Of course, by then we didn't have time to drive elsewhere. Very dissapointing. Listing times is such a simple thing."}
{"text":"Always an amazing meal when we go to the Local Dish. Service is always flawless. Can't remember the name of the young guy who we always get but he's great! Offers recommendations and constantly checks on us. Wait is a little long as they don't take reservations but it's worth it in my opinion.   Now for the food! Oh. Em. Gee! So good! It's true farm to table fresh and very innovative. Last time I was there I got a simple house salad with salmon. There was fresh goat cheese, pickled watermelon, and fresh spinach. The salmon was cooked to perfection. It was tossed with a watermelon champagne dressing that was to die for. My husband had a burger on a homemade pretzel bun. The best was the dessert! We had homemade sweet corn ice cream and a slice of the donut bread pudding. Outstanding! Highly suggest this place!!"}
{"text":"Just had the Carolina Grouper with side of rabbit hash it was excellent! We also ordered tomato mozzarella salad it was great along with the chicken salad and side of fresh local peaches and blueberries. Chocolate chess pie for dessert."}
{"text":"My Favorite place in Fort Mill!  I tell everyone about it.  We have been going there since they opened on 2012 and have loved every meal there.  The staff has always been so friendly and accommodating and they treat us like family.  We take all our out of town friends and family there and everyone loves it.  The atmosphere and the food are the BEST! You must try the bacon wrapped meatloaf and the scallops."}
{"text":"We just recently found out about Local Dish and I can absoultely tell you will will return.  The atmosphere is very warm and casual and very friendly.  We tried the fried green tomatoes and they were fabulous.  I ordered the Local Dish Burger which was a fairly large burger topped with bacon, pimento cheese and spinach on a pretzel roll and while it was not the healthiest thing to eat it was amazing.  We will definetley be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I had the meatloaf, risotto, and collards- all delicious! Love that this restaurant uses local ingredients from local farms.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and great atmosphere. Customer service has always been stellar as well. Highly recommend their chicken pot pie! One of our favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC! From seafood to their chick pot pie.. Everything is of very high quality. The staff are the nicest people as well."}
{"text":"Wonderful new southern cuisine!  Simple bright homey atmosphere. Very friendly and helpful wait staff.  Pork belly appetizer, PLT, beet salad and donut bread pudding were all wonderful.  Good iced tea and good local beer selection. If pork belly is wrong.....I don't want to be right ;)"}
{"text":"A great place for lunch or dinner in Downtown Fort Mill.  Everything that I have tried has been awesome!   The Shrimp and Grits are amazing and the Local Dish Burger is mouth watering.   If you are looking for bar food, similar to the prior establishment,  you won't find it here.  The cuisine here is more upscale and a must for anyone coming to Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"As Fort Mill residents, we are always looking for a non-chain restaurant, not only to support our local economy but also to avoid the generic fare at such eateries. Local Dish is a delightful surprise right in our own backyard. We have eaten there two times, and both times were equally good. Thursday night was as busy as Saturday night--we were shocked to see that we had to wait for a table on a random non-weekend evening, but that just proves how popular it is. My husband loves the meatloaf and I could eat the scallops every night--the red beet risotto is fabulous, and the intensity of the flavors makes the food taste even fresher. The service is excellent--efficient and genuinely nice waitstaff. The restaurant is small and it's pretty noisy--this is a not the place for an intimate, quiet dinner, but that's not really the aesthetic. The only thing we weren't thrilled with was the pumpkin hummus--crostini tasted dry and the pumpkin and chickpea together was just meh. Next time we'll be trying a lunch option. Be sure to visit this terrific restaurant! You will be a fan."}
{"text":"This is a great atmosphere, good food, but the portions don't match the prices. My husband had the chicken n waffles which were good, but was still hungry after eating the entire plate and an appetizer. The beer seemed quite expensive as well. I would not recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"The food will bring you back...       After moving to the area, this was the first restaurant that I visited. I have visited many times since.       The food is very good. I personally enjoy their traditional, buffalo flavored wings and their burgers. I have had other items from their menu and have never been disappointed. They do change their menu for the season, which is great. The menu is short and sweet and I always appreciate a simple menu; however, I personally think theirs can use a little more variety.       The environment is very relaxed and welcoming and the staff is very friendly. I do enjoy that aspect of the Local Dish but for the price, the wait staff can use some coaching when it comes to professionalism. The bartender seems to be pretty knowledgable about his position and he certainly displays the most poise of all the staff.       Overall, this is a good place to dine and have a good drink. Small town feel and laid back service. Not too easy on the wallet. The food is definitely what brings me back."}
{"text":"Service was good and it's a nice place but the food was salty as hell and the portion size was puny compared to the price I paid. This is no fine dining experience so don't charge us like it.it really isn't our fault your rent and expenses are high I was very disappointed especially after all the good reviews. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"I wish this restaurant was in Rock Hill.  Everything I have had has been excellent.  The service is great too.  Seating is first come basis.  Neat little place, farm fresh.  Eat here."}
{"text":"We had the Pork Chop and Shrimp and Grits for dinner. Both were fantastic! Love having a farm to table local food restaurant so close to home. A lunch stop is next!"}
{"text":"A very good resturant.  Chicken pot pie is delicious.  Chicken tempura is phenomenal. Husband really like meatloaf.  When the menu is more extended 5 stars will come quickly."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Reasonable prices.  Something for everyone on the menu.  Been here 5 times and great food every time. Support the local businesses!!!! Shrimp and grits is fantastic. Voted best burgers in the world by our teenage boys."}
{"text":"What a great experience! Parking right in front, cute diner with space for maybe 40 people. Walked in and were told a 25 minute wait (around 5:30) but we lucked out and 2 seats at the bar opened up.  Super friendly bartender, started off with their cherry bourbon coke cocktail, made with their own cherry infused bourbon, Delicious cocktail, with plenty of cherry flavor that still allowed the spicy sweet bourbon shine.  Appetizer was pulled pork nachos which were outstanding. Fresh pico de gallo and cilantro with tender pork. YUM. At one point the couple at the bar next to us just had to ask about our food because it looked so good. At this point, the couple next to us actually went out of their way to share their collared greens with us! They were regulars and just wanted us to try it! I have never, EVER, had anything like that happen while dining and I was ok with it!. It was a very inviting and friendly atmosphere, from the bartender to the servers.  Entrees were the pimento grilled cheese, and the PLT which is braised pork belly with tomato and jalapeno aioli. It was fantastic! My only gripe would be I wish the bun it was served on was somewhat bland, and didn't hold up to the rest of the ingredients. The hand cut fries were crisp and the friend green beans were tender, but maybe a little too salty.  All in all a great couples night restaurant or anytime restaurant. We can't wait to show it off next time friends or family come to visit, but we probably won't wait that long to dine there again!"}
{"text":"Very good food following the trendy local/farm to table concept that has captured the interest of many across the country. I've had positive experiences at both lunch and dinner although I will point out it would be prudent to call ahead if you're interested in dining with them on a Saturday evening- specifically during the mid-evening. While they advertise to be open until 10pm, my party was recently turned away at 9pm as they indicated there hadn't been enough business to warrant keeping the kitchen open. This was particularly discouraging as I had been playing up the restaurant to my out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere. A welcomed addition to the generally bland food options around Fort Mill. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Certainly a great example that you don't have to sacrifice quality or creativity in running a farm-to-table restaurant.  Worth the drive from South Charlotte.  Loved the green beans, the bacon-wrapped scallops, the shrimp & grits, the PLT (which the g-free wife had sans-bun) and the slices of pie for dessert.  Only nit we would pick: those chairs have seats that are very nice for long legged adults, but very uncomfortable for kids.  Ours, who are restaurant vets, struggled to sit still in them the entire time.  Nonetheless, the food is more than good enough to bring us back.   Service was friendly as well as capable."}
{"text":"Always fantastic food and great service. Easily one of the best restaurants in South Carolina."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant.    Definitely one of go to spots.  Always love the original menus the chefs create.  Keep it up John.  You've done a great job.   Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times and am really impressed. Everything we have had has been excellent. This includes the shrimp and grits and fish po-boy. A great local restaurant that we will be returning to often."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at this downtown restaurant. Party of 8 so we had to split into two groups of 4 but that worked out well. Lots of different orders for lunch, the Pork belly lettuce and tomato was excellent, lightly charred hunks of meaty pork belly on a fresh roll, with micro greens, the Turkey sandwich served on sour dough with avocado was very nice, lots of Turkey Brest meat and a generous amount of avocado, the grilled shrimp Poorboy had 6 plump fresh grilled shrimp, deveined tails off on a hoagie  bun with tarter sauce. The waffle and chicken was a great take on a southern classic. Chicken tenders batter dipped a quickly fried over tender, light waffles. Shrimp and grits were almost shrimp and polenta the grits were so smooth, meatloaf wrapped in bacon over mushroom risotto won the day, not sure the mix of meat in the meatloaf but it was much more than just beef.  Service was attentive and fast, a large group on a busy day, could not have gone better. Off the beaten path but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Eat here regularly. Not only is the food here consistently excellent, but the interior feels comfortable. Great staff and unpretentious. Great, farm to fork southern food in a great setting. My favorite locale for food in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"OMG ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! I think this was the best meal I've had by far!!! The customer service was spectacular, the atmosphere is simple but yet great! I really enjoyed my meal. I'll definitely be returning...FYI BEST BREAD PUDDING EVERRRR!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate for the first time.  I had the shrimp and grits and it was one of the best I've had, with a little kick, nice plump shrimp.  Wife had pot pie and at first it was not that tasty but as she got use to the rosemary, she really liked it.  Service was good and food delivered hot and fast.  I will go back"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, the food here is pretty good. Interesting take on southern. And... never bring guests here. It's the ridiculous management that is the issue. I took a team of employees there for a lunch. I also invited a new team member to meet us there. I assured them it wouldn't be a big deal for them to join in. ... I was WRONG. First, I asked the server if they wouldn't mind if I brought a chair over to our table. The server tilted their head to the side apologetically, \"I'm so sorry, we can't.\" ... huh? \"Well, we have someone joining us. They aren't ordering anything. Just coming to meet everyone.\" \"I'm sorry, the manager doesn't allow us to add chairs.\" The server looked almost embarrassed to be saying something so silly. I thought it was bizarre, but since there were only a few people in the restaurant I figured we could just switch to a larger table and this manager would be satisfied. \"Can we switch to the next table?\" Mind you, my other guests already had their food, so this would inconvenience them quite a bit at this point, but I had already invited someone to join us. \"Sure. We can do that.\" \"Great! Thank you so much.\" I stood up to help everyone move over. \"Oh no, im sorry, you have to wait for your other party member to come to switch tables.\" ... seriously? I have to wait for my guest to get here and awkwardly stand at the door while we move our plates and drinks and settings? \"Can you ask your manager if it would be okay for us to go ahead and move over? Or to pull a chair over? I promised my guest it wouldn't be a big deal if they stopped in.\" So they asked. And this dude literally stood there 20 feet from me and told his server to come tell me no. Inconsiderate chicken couldnt even step a few feet to tell us sorry and give us a good reason. Just that he doesn't want to let us, so he doesn't have to. It was late afternoon and very quiet in the restaurant. There was no good reason to put us in that position. It was embarrassing for me and for my guests. I will not be returning. Nor will I encourage anyone else to go. Why pay so much money to be treated so badly. Even if the food was amazing, it's not worth you or your guests being treated like worthless cattle by people who should care a little more about their customers and their business."}
{"text":"Blink and you'll miss it. But don't miss it, because this is one of the best eateries in the Charlotte area. Tucked away in a storefront on the sleepy main street in the old section of Fort Mill, Local Dish ascribes to the \"farm to fork\" philosophy, and it ascribes to it in spades. Everything is, as the name suggests, locally grown, and tastefully prepared, done with the right amount of Southern comfort.   Try their Local Dish burger, topped with a massive dollop of pimento cheese and crispy cured bacon, with a generous serving of spinach. This is one of the best burgers in the area, and if you're willing to drive to the hinterlands that is Fort Mill to sample this, you won't be disappointed.  Local Dish is a charming eatery with a friendly, welcoming vibe. I've eaten there a couple of times now, and I'm being treated like a regular. I love that.   If it were up to me, Local Dish would be better known throughout Charlotte. But for now, I'm happy that it's one of the best kept-secrets, and I'm even more glad that I live just a hop, skip, and a jump away from one of my new favorite food joints in town."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!   I love the fried spinach, the pimiento cheese burgers, and  just about everything I have ordered from this menu.  The owner and the wait staff are great.  It is so refreshing to have a nice restaurant in Fort Mill that is not a chain.  Especially on Main Street.    The price of the menu items is reasonable and appropriate for the high quality dishes."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles!  The best around.  Parking is troubling but manageable.  Service is good.  The lunch crowd is \"local ladies that lunch\"."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My husband had the Chicken and Waffles...very tasty. Chicken perfectly cooked on a light and crispy waffles with fresh blackberries in it. I had the spinach salad....AWESOME..and the Chicken Pot Pie, which was comfort food at it's absolute best. Small, cozy restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  A gem in Fort Mill. I had read most of the reviews on here and decided to try for ourselves, as most were excellent. Now I think that the people who gave bad reviews were maybe a little snooty and hard to please...as one person said that \"it was Fort Mill after all\".  Fort Mill is a quaint little town that we are very proud to be residents of...a great place to live and work."}
{"text":"There is limited parking in the front on the street. But if you drive around back, there are plenty of spots. For dinner they open at 5:00pm and expect to see people waiting to get in. Just put your name on the list and wait, it's worth it.   For appetizer we had fried green beans and and order of chicken skins. The beans were very lightly breaded and quick fried just enough to tender up and served with a ranch dip. The chicken skins were fried and resembled chips, and were served with local pickeled veggies and hot sauce. Both dishes were spot on.    Main course I had braised short rib served with mashed potatoes and collard greens. The short rib was perfectly seasoned and cooked, fork tender. The greens and potatoes were very well done. My wife ordered the \"Local Burger\". Some may say why a burger? But like everything else we had this was as good of a burger as could be had, I sneaked a bite of her's when she went to the restroom, well actually it was two bites. Great flavor and juicy perfectly cooked.   We were full by this point but I asked anyway \"What do you have for dessert?\" Well when the waiter got to \"Homemade Bread Pudding\" I said stop right there. It was a hot, moist, sweet and a slightly caramelized slice of goodness. It made an excellent end to one of the best meals that could be had.    So park around back. Be prepared to wait, if you ever see a restaurant where nobody is waiting to get in, there's probably a reason. And enjoy a wonderful departure into a privately owned gem of a restaurant, and take a break from the malaise that has become chain restaurant meals. You'll find in downtown Ft Mill a hidden wonder, where the art of dining, great service and wonderful food all come together. Enjoy."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the CLT area! I've tried their meatloaf and mushroom risotto (5/5 stars), Local Dish burger (5/5 stars..the pimento cheese on it: i can't even...), and their wings as an appetizer (5/5 stars, seriously amazing). Can't say enough about this place! Friendly, warm atmosphere! Always busy any time i've been. I'm so happy this place is in Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"My experience was similar to Jo Anne's - nothing WOW'ed me but then again all my original picks were sold out, so I settled for the pear & beet salad with chicken. My husband had the turkey, bacon & avocado sandwich and the other parties at my table had a burger and the pulled pork nachos. I didn't get to sample either, but they were extremely pleased with their selections. I think I'll have to try again and hope the best stuff isn't sold out."}
{"text":"We went to for lunch. Restaurant was busy so we sat at the bar. Even with a full restaurant our food came out very quickly. We ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, which had pesto and pears. Also the chicken salad sandwich both came with a side and both were great. Our food was fresh, flavorful and presentation was great. Everything coming out of the kitchen looked very appetizing. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there we asked our server what he liked. He gave us suggestions and actually giving a description of the items. So helpful!! We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I've driven by here many times, and despite all the accolades, I could never make myself stop.  For me, a big part of dining out is atmosphere and I wasn't too sure about Local Dish. I guess I prefer places with comfy booths, nooks and crannies and a little privacy.  At the same time, I love the idea of supporting a local business.    This weekend, we finally went.  I'm glad we did.  Yes, the restaurant is one big open, bright room, no comfy booth in sight, but somehow, it works. Local Dish feels friendly, relaxed and the kind of place where the staff wil remember you.  Our server was Kyle and he was soft spoken, but knowledgable about the menu and very efficient.    Across the board, our food was very good.  The shrimp and grits dish was very creamy and rich.  I've been craving it ever since.  Sandwiches were all tasty (burger and PLT).  The buns were especially fresh and tasty.  The food came out very, very quickly.  Impressive for such a small place.  We tried the bread pudding and their new strawberry cake for dessert. Both very good - not great, maybe - but they cured the sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Great service, fair prices, good food. I ordered the shrimp and grits which had an excellent flavor, but the grits were too thick and pasty, even with the abundant amount of gravy. Besides that and the noise levels, everything else here has been excellent."}
{"text":"My husband is a sucker for Southern food being from the South and I am a convert for sure. The South just makes food that makes you feel like you are in someone's home enjoying a large family dinner. It truly is feel good comfort food!   Upon entering, the ambience was cozy like entering into a small hometown greasy spoon. The rustic chairs, glass table tops, hand towel napkins and local area photographs hanging along the walls give this place a personal touch.   We sat at the bar, which is customary for us. We were immediately greeted by Adam. I decided to be bold and ask if he knew the ABVs of the beers they have on tap. Normally, this question meets with a disappointing \"No\" that I have now grown accustomed to. To my surprise Adam was very knowledgeable of what they had and made a couple of suggestions. This ranks high in my book! It shows that the bartender took the time to know their products. Trust me, this goes a long way when encouraging sales and upsells. We decided on one of their high octane beers and, of course, were not disappointed.  Their menu had so many delicious bites that it was difficult to choose. Our eyes were drawn to their country sausage dip with chips as this was a refreshing change to the standards of salsa or spinach artichoke. The dip consists of sausage, heavy cream, parmesan and cream cheese. We ordered it to eat in. I am usually a dainty dip lady and rarely scoop. One taste of this sausage creamy goodness had me sold and I was scooping away! The chips were thick and crispy which is the way we like it. Adam noticed we were getting low on chips, and brought us more. We have been to places where they charge you additional for chips when not enough was given in the first place. We finished all the chips and my husband licked the spoon as licking the bowl may have been a bit much in public, lol! The sausage dip is a must have when coming here, its unique and absolutely fabulous!! I would come here just for this dish. It's seriously that good and can be used as a topping for biscuits, chicken or even pork.   We got their Local Dish Burger and coleslaw to go and gobbled it down as soon as we got home. Being back in the South, my husband has become a bit of a coleslaw connoisseur. Their coleslaw was crunchy, flavorful and, most importantly, not watery. Oh yeah, they have happy hour Mondays thru Fridays 5:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Its not much of a discount (.50 cents a beer), but, it is the first happy hour we experienced any where since moving here in November: And, we have visited our fair share of bar and breweries.    Bravo on the Southern fare! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A cozy nock in the heart of fort mill. Had a short wait on a Friday night but it was definitely worth it!   I enjoyed the mushroom appetizer with a pure of sweet potatoes was Devine! The flavors and crunch went so well together.   My main course was the shrimp pasta. My friends enjoyed the steak, scallops and chicken and waffles.   Every bit of the pasta and shrimp was so delicious, the flavors and seasonings really appealed to my taste pallet.   Definitely recommend it! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First, the food is amazing, so the rating does not reflect that.  Service is good as well. However, the noise level is awful!  We have been many times, lunch, dinner, various days.  While the noise may be different each time, it is still BAD.  Wish they would add something to absorb the noise, not only people noise, but dish handling noise.  We were there April 10, 2015 and will most likely not be back. Everyone had to scream to talk at their table so no relief.  Great food, bad headache.  Very disappointing.  Local Fort Millian..."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  And we are Very particular.  We had the ribeye and the scallops.  Wonderful small town appeal.  The quality of the food would rival any great restaurant in a large city. We come from Los Angeles so had a lot to choose from. This would be at the top of our list. Our waiter Kyle was exceptional."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on a whim with my sleepy 2-year-old and we had a really nice lunch. Both of us enjoyed the kale chips appetizer and I had the chicken salad sandwich. Everything was really fresh and really, really tasty. Simple and healthy without any flavor missing, just as it should be! The waitress was also very nice, we had a really lovely time."}
{"text":"Delicious, tiny space that is clean and friendly. Personable staff that accommodated us at the bar for lunch. The Pork belly was amazing and not overly expensive. This is a gem of a place if you are in Ft. Mills downtown. Well actually I think it's only one of 2 options but at least it's good!"}
{"text":"Freaking awesome meal. We wanted to grab a quick lunch heading out of town, had the root chips app (awesome), wife had a pimento cheese sandwich (awesome), and I had the best po-boy (grilled fish) I've ever had (double awesome).  Friendly, clean, comfortable.  If you are trying to figure out where to go definitely pick this spot."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Fort Mill.  Friendly service.  Small mom/pop operation.  Not a large place so can get busy.  Arrive before 530 for dinner without a wait.  I enjoy the pimento cheese burger and natural cut fries.  Also like the shrimp and grits and the hot wings appetizer.  Haven't ordered much else but dinner companions always rave about their meals as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined in on a Friday evening. They were very busy, but the wait was only about 30 minutes. It's a small place and casual. I ordered Shrimp Pasta. It was delicious. I usually don't like anything with red sauce, but this was the tastiest dish I have had in a long time. The shrimp were delectable and it was seasoned perfectly.My husband got the special which was a grilled white fish. He is very picky about his food, but raved about this dish.We have dined at many other more expensive places in the Charlotte area that don't hold a candle to this reastauant. No wonder this place was so busy and gets so many good reviews. The only reason I can't give it a 5 is because our wedge salad wasn't cold when it arrived and they do not serve bread. Bread would have made our meal perfect. We will definitely be back to this tasty restaurant. Maybe one day they will serve bread with their meals."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious, you can order anything and it will be yummy! It is a tad bit pricey but in my opinion the quality is worth it! Good job Fort Mill we need more of these kinds of places!"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were exceptional. It is, however, very small and there were several families with small (6-month - toddler age) children. Through no fault of the owner/management of the restaurant- all was lost when several of the kids began crying or fussing. With it being a small restaurant to begin with, you can't escape the noise.  It amazes me why people choose to bring small children to a nice restaurant, then ruin it for everyone else."}
{"text":"Took my 90 year old mother for lunch by the back entrance. The sign on the door said it opened in 3 minutes. An employee opened the door and we were told to wait outside even though inside the  hallway was a bench whereby mom could've had a seat. They said there were people lining up in front and it wouldn't be fair. Once we we're let in there was no one outside waiting and they were totally unapologetic and rude. Never going again."}
{"text":"Excellent place! Food is really good but not cheap. Atmosphere is great and service is really good. I love eating here and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Just wow. Found this little gem on a whim with my parents and I could not have been more satisfied with this meal.   We started off at the bar due to the line and we're delighted at the quality of the drinks. The peach and blackberry margarita was the best margarita I've ever had. Coke and bourbon was also terrific.   Started off to eat with the pulled pork nachos , (which contained the best pork I've had in South Carolina, and I've been to multiple top rated restaurants), the fried green beans and the braised pork belly. These appetizers were all individually incredible for different reasons but I would recommend sharing the pulled pork nachos to anyone who comes here. Absolutely a must try!  For a meal I ordered the chicken pot pie which exceeded all expectations. The richness and incredible flavor of the cream sauce along with the crust will forever cement this place in my heart. Absolutely stunning.  The pan seared scallops and grouper were also incredible.  Finished this exceptional meal off with house-made peach ice cream alongside their bread pudding. Left all of us perfectly stuffed and ready for a nap. I would recommend this place to anyone and can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Local dish makes me so happy! When I first moved to the area I stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30, so I was the only customer. I had the bbq sandwich which was okay. I prefer Vinegar based bbq (being a local from eastern Nc) and it was fairly saucy. I just went back last week and had a totally different experience. The place was full, great music was playing the background and everyone was laughing and having a good time. As if it were literally the local hangout. I sat at the bar and had the chicken salad. Very good! All the waitstaff are super friendly and willing to strike up a real conversation with you. I have also had the pimento cheese which I can assure you will arrive in a healthy serving!!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends for dinner for the first time. We ordered to start the pulled pork nachos - yummy!  Then I had the seared scallops with risotto and carrots. Scallops were cooked perfectly and seasoned just right. I placed a to-go order for the hubbie of the shrimp pasta which I tried too and was delicious. Overall all the dishes were superb and I'm so looking forward to going back again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious meal! I had the shrimp pasta with zucchini noodles instead of linguini. It was very flavorful and the zucchini noodles were cooked perfectly which is hard to do. I also tried the fried green beans that my friend had ordered and they were amazing."}
{"text":"Our favorite Friday night spot!!! Best chicken pot pie on the planet.  The salads and dressings are fresh and tasty and even the pork nachos are enjoyable for a girl who doesn't like pork. The service is always on point, always. Not a huge menu, nor location but maybe that's how you keep everything flawless."}
{"text":"Revisited Local Dish after 3 months. Had the pulled pork nachos...this time no hair! It was scrumptious! Also had the scallops and apple bacon risotto with fabulous roasted carrots! Delectable.  My wife had the chicken pot pie. Delicious and reminded us of thanksgiving flavors! EXTREMELY HOT. Be careful! Great service. Cool, intimate atmosphere.   Love LD!"}
{"text":"We had dinner recently at this place (recommended to us by our Realtor). We were welcomed and promptly seated at a table.  The place was half-full (late dinner during the weekend).  Our  server was just lovely and made sure we were doing fine throughout our meal..  I had the apple cider margarita, which is served in a small mason jar, riml dipped in salt and cinnamon.  It was pleasant but light on tequila.  We shared a plate of black pea hummus with chips.  It was pleasant but a little bit salty on the top.  I had the Shrimp with pasta which was one of the best I've ever had.   My husband had the beef, medium/rare.  He was surprised that they did not overcook it (as it happens occasionally in other restaurants).  It was tender and pink.  There were no choices for side dishes, so his beef came with brussel sprouts (which he hates, but were not bad at all).  Dinner entrees do not come with salad or side dishes or even bread, just in case you were expecting them.   The \"donut\" bread pudding was a specialty of the house, as well as the maple ice cream.  The ice cream was delicious and helped to tone down the sweetness of the bread pudding (which is not really made out of bread ;-).  Will definitely return to try those fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"Such a cute little restaurant in downtown Fort Mill.  We decided to try it out after our plans at another place fell through and I'm glad I had the chance to stop in.  The service was great.  Our server was attentive, personable, and very friendly.  Chicken and waffles were good, but the shrimp pasta is where it's at.    I don't think it was overly pricey per some of the other reviews/friend's comments, but I feel that can be a bit on the subjective side.  For the quality of the food, I think the price was fair."}
{"text":"Very Southern!! I'm not from the South however when reading books and watching movies with Southern display on the forefront I SEE this PLACE all over it. The tables have actual kitchen towels that one would use in their kitchen to dry the dishes and these are used  as napkins. It's small, quaint and the food is all from local farms and VERY GOOD. I've had the Fish sandwish with fresh cut green apples and blueberries on the side. It's Good and the staff is friendly.."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I do wish they would rotate some items on the menu since the menu selection  is so small. Service is adequate."}
{"text":"Um good nachos, nice service, not a big fan of the other dishes or prices for what it is.."}
{"text":"Local Dish was great. Quaint little place with great service, local, and delicious food. Worth making the drive from Charlotte."}
{"text":"Idk something was off for me. Got a sandwich that was 12$ and it tasted good but not great. My girlfriend loved her salad but I was no feeling the place. I know a lot of people love it here and they use local produced food and veggies, but still..."}
{"text":"The food was extremely well prepared, we loved the cozy ambiance. Wish they offered reservations, great for MNO or date night. It is small so you could bring well-behaved kids."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! So many good reviews and recommendations. We had the local dish burger- good but not special- and the chicken and waffle. That was the disappointment. A waffle with three chicken strips(similar to what one would get at Zaxbys or chick fil a)for $15.50?I don't mind paying for my food but this was a joke. Sent it back and it was removed from Bill,however waiter copped an attitude and threw the plate into the scrap bin. Not nice, bud!  A bit of a trip for us to go there so based on our first impression we won't go back. Hope management takes note and changes the \"chicken/waffle\" to waffle with chicken strips maybe. LOL  And price adjustment."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!   Service was attentive!  Love it!  They accommodated my GF/CF dietary restrictions.  Nicely crafted cocktails.  We had bacon tomato soup.  It was so delicious.  Then I had jalapeno hummus with corn chips (cuz I couldn't eat the bread) The pickled watermelon salad was so good!  But the pork belly....I could wax poetic for years about the pork belly.  I couldn't leave until I stuffed every last morsel in my mouth!  It was legit.  Melt in your mouth.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME! Pork chop was delicious, the pot pie was amazing and the chess pie was one of the best I've had! It was a bit noisy; but, well worth the trip. It helps, too, that they have a full bar. Oh, and the service was excellent!!"}
{"text":"The food here is always fabulous. The Chicken skins are to die for! I know it sounds a little gross, but I seriously crave these unhealthy deep fried goodies on a weekly basis! The Shrimp and Grits are the best that I have ever had. They are creamy with huge shrimp. The atmosphere is fun and cozy. I absolutely love that they use dish  cloths as napkins. Such a great addition to Fort Mill!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks. Had the gnocci and almost licked the plate. Also highly recommend the salad with beets, peanuts and other fun stuff. Ribeye - amazing! Menu always changes so there is always something else to try."}
{"text":"Wow - just wow! Unbelievably amazing food! Found this place on Yelp on a road trip thru SC. We had the wedge salad, the pulled pork nachos, the cole slaw, the scallops on goat cheese risotto, and most importantly the fantastic pork belly! All A+ dishes! And the maple syrup bacon ice cream for dessert was  scrumptious!! Thank you to our super nice server Sarah! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best place to dine in Fort Mill.  I've never had a bad meal at the Dish and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Nice restuarant featuring local southern dishes with a twist.  A little expensive.  Friendly staff.  Interesting combinations.  They love their customers that visit often."}
{"text":"Usually we love this place. We came on a Wednesday with a family of 6 and were told there was no way they could get a group of 6 in. We've been seated with 6 here prior. They told us they could seat 2 and then in 15 minutes seat the other 4. We left and went to Hobos."}
{"text":"friendly and knowledgeable staff,had open face beef sandwich and was very tasty with frnch fries that were perfectly fried.salads and dressings are fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try this place for several weeks and finally made it on a Friday night.  They had a pretty good crowd around 7:30, and we liked the southern/local vibe.    We had the boiled peanut hummus and loved it.  It's actually a sweet hummus which we didn't expect but really enjoyed.  The crostini was a bit too hard and sparse.  Could've used about 4 more pieces.  A neighboring table got the pimento cheese fondue and it looked awesome.    I ordered the pimento cheese sandwich with fries and my husband got the pulled pork sandwich with fries and cole slaw.  He was underwhelmed by the pulled pork but loved the bread (brioche?) and the hand cut fries.  I loved the pimento cheese sandwich on sourdough and liked my fries as well.  Service was prompt and friendly, but we were put off by 2 things.  First, there were several empty tables when we came in and we asked for one on the side.  The gentleman told us someone had just called in for that one and so we'd have to sit right in front of the door where there was a huge draft every time someone entered or exited.  We were there for over an hour and no one ever showed up for that table.   The 2nd thing was that the waitress took our drinks away before she brought us the bill.  I've never had a waitress do that before.  She just came to our table, asked if we needed anything and then cleared the entire table before she brought the bill.  If we hadn't had those 2 problems I would've given them 4 out of 5.  Good local food, good atmosphere for a casual Friday night."}
{"text":"Locally sourced, fresh, and awesome. We had the meatloaf (who orders meatloaf, right?) Collards (I normally dislike collards very much), mushroom risotto, and a side of flash fried spinach.  Everything was simply terrific.  Service was EXCELLENT, our waitress was attentive and overall service was quick.  Ambiance is charming - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Rock Hill and Googled good restaurants nearby.This one came up. We went and we were pleasantly surprised at how fresh the scallops and salmon were. Did not expect that in Fort Mill. The preparations were wonderful. We loved the fresh arugula and beet salad. It is a little hole-in-the-wall on Main Street in Fort Mill. Many families there with children. So maybe not a great idea if you are on a romantic date. But my husband and I really enjoyed the meal. It has a full bar and that is always a plus."}
{"text":"My wife has been dying to check out local dish so we finally did. Really enjoyed it! Great environment, great food, great local dig."}
{"text":"The Local Dish hit the spot for us on a recent trip through Fort Mill. Our server was attentive and yet also unobtrusive (a rare but impressive combo). The crispy spinach was a really interesting side--similar to kale chips if you are into those. The decor was bright and in the shabby chic or cottage-style theme. The restaurant fit right in with the little main street district where it is located. It felt so much better eating here than at a chain closer to the highway."}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf with collard greens and mushroom risotto. The meatloaf was tasty but needed some sauce. The real winners were the collards(cooked perfectly), and the risotto! Creamy and full of mushrooms. Yum! My wife had the salmon with a tomato base. The salmon was cooked excellently. The tomato bar was silky and flavorful. A very successful meal."}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I decided to pop in and give the place a try after work.   Since I was dining solo, I decided  to just sit at the bar & had great service from the super nice bartender .  I had hoped to try the blackberry peach margarita but it is only available spring/summer. However, they had an apple cider margarita with apple infused tequila in a cinnamon - sugar rimmed mason jar. Yum!  Since the weather is cold, I was definitely in the mood for some comfort food and ordered the Chicken pot pie. This is one of my favorite childhood treats. Their version had a nice rich creamy base &  a puff pastry crust. It had a great flavor but the puff pastry was a little chewy.  Unfortunately I did not save room for dessert but the donut bread pudding sounded good! Next time I will have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"When I go to Local Dish, I'm instantly transported to the Hominy Grill in Charleston, one of my favorite restaurants. Local Dish features similar butcher paper-covered tables, gourmet Southern cuisine, and did I mention the fun cocktails? It's no-frills and doesn't deck itself like a Cracker Barrel. By not trying to be something it isn't, it's an awesome place. There's a homey feel from the front door down to the dishes, with washcloths as napkins and attentive servers. They won't be telling you stories all night, but if you ask for a hot sauce, they'll ask what kind and bring over every kind they have from down-the-street Pucker Butt over to the table.  I highly recommend the Bacon Old-Fashioned, a potent concoction of bacon-infused bourbon, orange slice, bitters, and club soda. And the perfect start to Local Dish's cuisine.  The cuisine is creative with Southern-style dishes. Boiled peanut hummus, Pimento cheese fondue, and chili-oil scallops are all great, prepared well, and are a delight to eat. This delicious approach goes all the way to dessert, where I had trouble putting down the Krispy Kreme bread pudding. It's fusion food I can get behind.  This is a wonderful addition to Main Street, Fort Mill. In between all of the antique shops and crumbling bricks, it's great to see a fresh-minded and fun place like Local Dish."}
{"text":"Fresh, local, unique food. Great service. Seasonal menus that allow for changes in the same dish throughout the year. I've been 15+ times and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I had the house salad, braised short ribs & buttermilk pie.  Everything was so good I wanted to lick the plates clean!!!  Even my hubby, who is picky like me, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Local Dish is a great place serving up quality dishes with an attentive staff.  The Pork Belly and Nachos were great and larger portions than expected.  They have created something special and I can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"Great service at this local place in Ft. Mill.  I have had numerous entrees which were all very good.  The service though is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic southern home cooking in plaza midwood sounds funny I know but this place is the REAL deal! Not a huge meat loaf fan but their Cajun meatloaf is a true masterpiece. Crazy big servings and lots of great options. Cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"A special find on my business trip. I had the pulled pork nachos, which included a generous portion of succulent pulled pork. Followed it up with Shrimp n Grits. On the heavy side, but flavorful and filling. Great beer local beer selection was the cherry on top."}
{"text":"We eat here on a regular basis, the food is OK, but a little pricy for what you really get. The chairs are rather uncomfortable, but the service seems sincere. By that, I mean, it seems they try, but usually are really slow with refills. I like the idea of a local restaurant in downtown Fort Mill, and this is one of the reasons we go. We always walk to the restaurant which is also pretty cool. I really wish the menu was more varied, however, and it seems that both lunch and dinner menu are basically the same. We ate once for dinner, but will not come back for dinner. It does, however make a nice place for lunch. It has a tendency to fill up rather quickly ... there just are not all that many places to eat in downtown Ft. Mill (like two)."}
{"text":"It's worth the drive off the interstate 77. The place is located 12 minutes from Rock Hill.  The seating capacity is 61. So, is a smaller place. As the name indicates the food is local.  What makes this place special is the team. Everyone works well together. They all pitch in to get things done. And the culture is very positive. Happy hands make happy customers. You'll enjoy the experience and the food. I did."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first date here and it remains our absolute favorite place. The food is awesome. I loooooove the black bean soup!!!! My fave. I also love the house salad with the watermelon vinaigrette. The fries are great! My guy says the burger is BOMB. I can't tell ya cause I am gluten intolerant so I can't touch the bun. Service and atmosphere is great, I love the farm house type feel. Well done place!:)"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing and kudos to our server Kyle! He was super personable and had great menu knowledge! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the Charlotte region. Everything on the menu is so good and is prepared beautifully! I recommend the chicken and waffles or the pork belly sandwich. I love the crispy spinach too."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome food!!! Great service and cute and cozy atmosphere. We always take our out of town visitors here to eat!!!"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by word of mouth from a friend.  Located in \"downtown\" Fort Mill, Local Dish offers a welcome alternative to the chains and strip mall restaurants found off 160 and in the Baxter Area.  Menu choices were interesting and service was great.  While they appear to still be ironing the kinks out on their menu and other offerings (opened only a week) the Meatloaf, Chicken Pot Pie and Fried Green Tomatoes were great!  The place was full by 6:30 and was definitely satisfied with the meal even if it is a bit pricier than other places in the area.  There is parking on the street out front and in the rear off Clebourne.  No sign out front as of yet but it is the yellow building next to the Spratt Building.  The only negative I found were that while everything served was very fresh and flavorful, the meatlof was served with what appeared to be canned english peas.  Without those I would have given 5 stars.   I can look past that with how good the tempura fried green tomatoes were however.  Fort Mill needs a place like this and we will be back."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits I have ever had. Small and quaint dinning room. Usually busy but the wait isn't normally outrageous. The servers are nice and the bartender (Adam) is awesome. Recommendations   Appetizer: Pulled pork nachos (a must)   Entree: shrimp and grits or any special Dessert: donut bread pudding.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We have heard many recommendations for Local Dish, so we were excited to finally try it. It's pretty small, so we got there early to avoid a wait. They have many great looking dishes on the menu that I want to go back and try,  but when I saw Chicken and Waffles, the debate was over. Unfortunately, it didn't stand up to the chicken and waffles I've had in the past. The chicken is tempura fried and delicious. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. It was perfect. However, the waffles.... I was expecting a big, fluffy belgian waffle covered in syrup and butter (chicken and waffles isn't a healthy dish). The chicken was served with six mini waffles that reminded me of Eggo Minis that I made for breakfast in middle school. It's really unfortunate because the chicken was so good. Anyway, as I said, I want to go back to try at least six other options on the menu, so it didn't ruin the restaurant for me. I will be back and I will update my review when I do."}
{"text":"This is a place that you must go. We had the fried green beans as an appetizer, and we are still talking about how amazing they were. Our entrees were the short ribs and the special, which was the grouper. The short ribs were roasted to the point that it melted in your mouth. The collards and mashed potatoes were an excellent match and complemented the meat wonderfully. My mother had the special that was a grilled grouper, risotto, and grilled baby bok choy.  She said it might be the best grouper she's ever had, and she's from Florida! Everything is farm-to-table and has a great atmosphere. This is a definite must for anyone interested in GREAT food."}
{"text":"We loved local dish. The food was fresh and local and the service was great. This was so much better than a chain and just as fast. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Small town charm in a quaint country atmosphere, from the decor to the menu, everything here is all about the local experience. Local Dish get's their produce locally as the name suggests and it makes a difference from the taste to the texture of the food. My favorite appetizers are the Fried Green Beans and the Bacon wrapped Scallops, always prepared very well and consistent. I do admit that the Fried Green Beans took a couple of tries to get used to, but once I did it was excellent.   Now when it comes to the entree, you really can't go wrong in any direction from the Roasted Salmon to the Shrimp and Grits. My favorite is the Shrimp and Grits because it has the most soul food feel to it and it comes correct.  When you think of soul food, you think of Chicken and Waffles but on the occasions I've ordered this dish it's always been over saturated with oil and not much flavor to it...BLAND.  Plus, the waffles really aren't waffles but baby waffles; small little dots, sad looking dots. This is the one dish that Local Dish really needs to step up with and do it right.  Now, I don't mean to imply that Local Dish is soul food because from my experience it's not and they don't claim to be either. Nonetheless, you can't go wrong with Local Dish because they do it right and right all the time except for Chicken and Waffles. In the Fort Mill area, this is a must stop and try because you'll be delighted from the first bite to the last and when you're done you can send me a message thanking me for the recommendation. Lol."}
{"text":"In town for business. Went in for lunch and had the Chicken and Waffles. I'd say top 3 I've ever had. The service was outstanding. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Fort Mill. The service is always friendly and the food is awesome. I think their local dish burger is the best in SC. I would also recommend the PLT and pair them with fried greens beans. To kill for!!!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Fort Mill. We got lucky on a Thursday night and got a table pretty quick. They don't take reservations and if you have a party greater than 4, you should get on line around 4:30 to play it safe. Supposedly the lines on Friday and Saturday are huge.   Good beer selection but the food makes this place. ALL fresh ingredients. My wife had the scallops w/Brussel sprouts and I had the pork chop w collards. Appetizers we had the pork belly and split a beet salad. All of the good was amazing. Dessert we had the donut bread pudding. I recommend trying it!!"}
{"text":"Local Dish is on the quaint Main St of Ft Mill across from a comic bookstore, bow tie shop, & a knife sharpener.  The atmosphere inside matches that Mayberry type of feel that you are transported to when walking on Main St.  We had the fried green beans, pork belly, sweet potato gnocchi, & the fried fish po' boy.    The fried green beans were tasty - the natural flavor of the green bean came though. The sweet potato gnocchi could use a little boost.  It is pretty bland even w/the crisp sage.  If it wasn't for the sage it would be completely blah - maybe a bit of carmelized onion to complement or enhance the flavor.  The pork belly was really tough.   The fried fish po boy was very tasty.  The green beans & the po boy were fresh & didn't suffer from excess grease that sometimes is experienced w/fried food.  We originally intended to order chicken skins.  It was right after opening & already out.  We also received the last portions of green beans for the day.  Overall really enjoyed our meal & will be returning."}
{"text":"Great place you'd never go to unless referred by a friend. It's small and easy to overlook but the food is fresh and well prepared. We've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My only complaint is portions. I love food and exercise a lot so I can enjoy lots of food. This place is a lovely hometown spot for Fort Mill to be proud of. I have enjoyed several items but my favorite is the salmon with zoodles. Very well prepared and the colors provide an excellent presentation."}
{"text":"Lunch date with my friend was fantastic. I can't wait to visit again. We both enjoyed shrimp po boys and fries. Local dish is doing this the right way. Big juicy shrimp and \"real\" fries, cut fresh. We will definitely be back to try other items on the menu. Small restaurant on the strip in Fort Mill, SC."}
{"text":"After picking strawberries, we sure worked up an appetite. My friend suggested we go to Hobo's for dinner. While parking the car, we noticed Local Dish. Wanted some Southern Comfort Cuisine instead of burgers and bar food.  Let me tell you Local Dish did not disappoint at all. Lucked out with ordering the Chicken N Waffles and they were Blueberry waffles not smothered nor swimming in syrup. Oh no! Just the right amount of bourbon syrup that brings out the sweetness blended with the blueberries. The chicken was cooked just right with a tempura batter and tasted moist with juices coming out as you sink your teeth into it.  Top it off with a mason jar filled with their Southern Mule. Ginger beer with pear infused vodka. Yum!  Also had the fried green tomatoes- most memorable was the charred green onion aioli.  Sweet tooth a calling. Ordered an Angel cake but waitress got the Chocolate Chess Pie instead which was rich and thick. Reminded me of the texture of a pecan pie. Yummy! With a cup of coffee, we were good to go back on the road.  Whenever I down in South Carolina and got the urge for Southern Home Cooking I be coming to Local Dish for the friendly staff, service and their Chicken N Waffles here."}
{"text":"I was literally driving through \"downtown\" FTM and saw this place out of the corner of my eye. Turned the car around and decided to go in and try it out. The owners are super friendly and genuinely care about the best interest of the customers. The menu is a little different, but it forced me to go outside of my comfort zone and try something new. For an appetizer we played it safe with wings, and they were really good-actually better than most wing joints. A little spicy, but very good. For my entree I had the chicken and waffles. A combination I have never heard of (I'm not from the South), but it was surprisingly very tasty. My husband had the pot pie which I also sampled and it was full of flavor. It had a different taste than your average pot pie-probably due to the Parmesan.The service was excellent, food was quick, and the ambiance was very quaint. I was overall very pleased with my experience, and give the owners huge props-especially for only being open for a week or so."}
{"text":"In a shop front along Ft. Mill's dead main street?  You bet and a great sign that there is hope for a Main Street renewal.  Local Dish is local, fresh ingredients and nicely done.  Interior is sparse, with bare hardwood floors and simple hand-made signage with quips on the wall.  Tables, chairs are about it.  Not much decor or ambiance, but once you get your food, who would care?  Menu has some unusual items, and covers the waterfront of reasonable meal and appetizer choices.  Yes, desserts, too, but not being a dessert-eater, I don't pay that area much attention.  Watching cooking and restaurant shows, I kept hearing of braised pork belly which is very thick \"hunks\"of bacon.  Local Dish as it on the menu as an appetizer and it was decadent and delicious.  Rich, fatty, flavorful and yummy.  Had the shrimp, artichoke and tomato pasta, which was scrumptious.  In fact three of the six of us had the pasta.  Their humble hamburger was wolfed down by one guy, who would not share.  He only said it was great and that the meat was excellent.  Wife has wedge and some other appetizer, thoroughly enjoyed.  Full bar that knows how to do a perfect Manhattan and a terrific apple sour Margarita.  Forget reservations, as they do not take them.  So arrive early or prepare to wait, especially on weekend evenings.   We left, all happy."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is comfortable and welcoming. I wish I could recall our server's name but he was polite, professional. patient and wonderful. I said \"patient\" in that my friend needs to stick to a strict diet due to food allergies. She had many questions and the server never said, \"I don't know.\" He'd take the time to find the answer and never seemed bothered. To be completely honest, I don't even recall what I had other than it was a wrap along with some fresh cut french fries. I enjoyed it quite a bit and my friend enjoyed her food. They were actually able to find something for her to eat suitable for her food allergies. This restaurant is good for families, date night, or any other occasion."}
{"text":"The service was good but did not like the sausage gravy dip. We will probably come again because it looked like there were better choices passing us!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Came here for lunch with my husband and child! I had a fish on the menu it was cooked perfectly! The service was on point and attentive! Food was fresh with fresh ingredients and taste was super! Looking forward to having the opportunity to try this again. My husband loves his burger as did my child! The fries were crisp and cooked magnificent! Definitely something worth a try!"}
{"text":"Took an put of town friend here for dinner a week or so ago. Food was amazing as usual. Service was superb as well. I had shrimp and grits and my friend had the roasted beet and pear salad. It's a small salad but it had great flavor!"}
{"text":"After reading the positive Yelp reviews, we had very high hopes for this quaint little restaurant nestled among the downtown store fronts of Fort Mill SC. We were thrilled that there was only a 15 minute wait at 5:30 on a Saturday evening; however, experience should have hinted that, in itself, that was a bad omen, for no worthwhile restaurant this close to Charlotte would have less than a hour wait on a Saturday evening. At no point during our 90 minute stay was the restaurant full nor was there any further wait.  I now understand why.  We started off at the bar with a draft beer and a Cucumber Citrus Gin & Tonic that was nothing special (and short of gin). As far as service goes, little finesse or professionalism was exhibited from the bartender to the manager.   After arriving at our table, we ordered our $7.50 house salads which had a nice light balsamic glaze, candied pecans and goat cheese. Other than a scarcity of pecans (we counted 6 small pieces), it was not bad.  Midway through our salads, our entrees arrived and, along with them, our real problems (which were glaring). I ordered the shrimp and grits at $16 and it arrived nicely plated. The grits however were lukewarm which I just let slide. There was also a shortage of andouille sausage and I'd rate the entire dish as average.  At the recommendation of the sweet young lady serving us, my wife chose the pan seared scallops at $23. The scallops themselves, while over-seasoned, were cooked perfectly and were tasty, yet the bed of ginger risotto beneath them was bland and tepid. The accompanying brussel sprouts were burnt black and more of a garnish than a side, as described in menu.  My wife very politely asked our server if her risotto could be warmed up and she apologized as she returned the plate to the kitchen. A few minutes later, on a separate plate, she returned the scallops and brussel sprouts ONLY (that had been scraped off its original plate). After she said that the risotto was being heated up, my wife and I stared at each other stunned while wondering aloud if Candid Camera might be involved. In a few minutes more, the manager dropped off the reheated risotto and mumbled a hardly coherent \"Sorry bout that.\"  It was the last words he would speak to us. Of course, by this time, the scallops were cold! I have included photos of the entree before and after the reheat. Upon arriving home we realized that he did at least reduce the price of her entree - an entire buck!  We finished our food, incredulously, and left vowing never to return. If I were you, I wouldn't either. There are too many better choices."}
{"text":"Recommended by our son and daughter in law. They have only lived in the area a few months and this has been their favorite place to eat. I had the scallops, my husband had the shrimp pasta, my son the meatloaf ( he orders it every time!) and my daughter in law had the lobster P.O. boy. All were very happy with our meals. Not your average dishes. Delicious!! Fast friendly service and great drinks. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had Meatloaf with mushroom risotto and collards.  My grandmother passed a number of years ago but they must have stolen her recipe for collard greens!  Fab food, setting and service. My wife had the amberjack special which she loved."}
{"text":"What a real surprise, this place is top notch, excellent food and drinks.  Parking is out front on the street or a big shared parking lot in the rear, nothing close to this quality in the area"}
{"text":"I've been to local dish twice, and ordered the local dish burger both times.  The burger is done to perfection...juicy and pink on the inside, but a good sear on the outside.  The pimento cheese and bacon just top it off.  One of the best burgers I've eaten - and this isn't even a burger joint.  Will be back again, and again.  Also love the fried green beans with tartar sauce."}
{"text":"Good local fare.  Comfortable setting, good local dishes, beer, and wines. Friend green beans were awesome.  Wife had shrimp and grits and they were on point.  My kids got the local dish burgers and they were AWESOME.  I ate half my sons burger - didn't expect it to be so good... bacon, pimento cheese, etc.  salmon with zucchini noodles were awesome as well."}
{"text":"Still the best place to eat in Fort Mill. There's some new spots in town but this place is by far the best. It's an update  to the old southern  favorites your  Mamma made in a quaint historic building. The building only has about 12 tables and they don't  take reservations , but the kitchen and service is fast do the wait is never that bad. The food is always fresh, local, and delicious. I've never had a bad meal and I eat here just about  every week since they've opened their doors. Family  favorites change with the seasons, but include; fried green tomatoes, Fried green beans, black beans soup, chicken and waffles, Jalape√±o hummus, sweet and spicy wings, and the rib eye with oyster mushrooms.   Things change throughout the seasons, but we know we will always love it!"}
{"text":"Rock Hill, South Carolina. Casual but very pleasant ambience. Very noisy. Food was okay, not particularly to expectation. Ordered shrimp with grits. Lots of shrimp and sausage. Grits were too creamy; should have been coarse. Shrimp lacked taste. Would be better to serve fewer but larger shrimp. Had a scoop of their new flavor ice cream, peanut butter and jelly. Too strong on peanut butter taste. The server said this was something they were trying for the first time and it was made in house. Would be better if it had just a swirl of peanut butter, the kind that has crushed peanuts, not smooth."}
{"text":"Local dish was a local surprise on a recent drive from Massachusetts to Miami. Yelp steered us to it, and it was a charming, tasty option for our evening. We sampled almost all of the appetizers, some great...some ok. (The deviled eggs pale in comparison to our own homemade recipe, and strangely had a slight funky taste that wasn't to our liking.) However, the drinks and service were friendly, the vibe cool and relaxed, and the evening a good one."}
{"text":"REALLY Great Food! It was worth the few minute detour off 77 for dinner!  Lots of great dinner options with the obvious southern flair and everything was quality fresh food. We loved the pork nachos to start. Homemade salsa, gooey cheese, and Sweet and spicy bbq pork, and they weren't skimpy with it! Also had the veggie sandwich with monster cut fries and meatloaf with mashed potatoes and gravy with a side of crispy fried spinach. Wish we had room for dessert, but there's always next time!   We will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are very new to the area and came here for a special date night dinner. The waiting area is basically nonexistent, and can be sort of confusing when it's your first time there. Apparently there is a backdoor to the restaurant that we never saw, we just parked on the street and came in from there, but the hostess station was at the back of the restaurant, near the bar and bathrooms. The waiting area is small and really cramped, especially because another couple brought a child with them (the child was a monster, but that is no reflection on the restaurant.) anyway, we get seated and Kerri (Carrie? I'm not sure) was our waitress. She was the cutest, sweetest thing I've ever seen! My husband got the shrimp pasta and loved it and I got some of the BEST shrimp and grits of my life!! Great service, amazing food. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I love, love Local Dish!   We discovered this spot, when we were town hopping, looking for places to eat! We saw that there were people inside, and we figured we would give it a try!  The decorations is pretty Southern- it's not a bad thing! it makes you feel more comfortable knowing what to expect!   I had the Pan Seared scallop with Apple Bacon Risotto and roasted carrots! and boy oh boy-- it was DELISH! The Scallops texture, the flavor are amazing! I would eat it over and over again that's how excellent it was!"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice homey atmosphere. Too many yummy choices. Had fried green tomatoes, shrimp & grits, donut bread pudding with coffee ice cream, and raspberry lemonade cocktail. Definitely worth coming again!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me here for dinner. The atmosphere is great and the food is even better! I got the salmon with the zucchini pasta in a tomato broth. It was a really creative dish and cooked perfectly. I will definitely be back to try some other things on the menu. Oh, and if you like Cheerwine seriously try the cherry bourbon cokes. It's like your childhood, but better."}
{"text":"We live in the area and had not been to the restaurant in a while.  We had 1-cup of soup ($3.00), 1/2 lb. burger (8.50), and a PLT ($10.00).  The PLT was to have an aioli on the bread per the menu.  There was an indistinguishable smear of the aioli.  When I asked Paige for more informing her the sandwich was dry, I was informed there would be an upcharge for the aioli of $.50.  She delivered the aioli and there was maybe a tablespoon of aioli in the vessel.  She said she would tell the chef about the issue. While we can afford $.50, you think they would have wanted a satisfied customer especially since the menu says the aioli is on the item and it was not.  We most likely will not return.  If they have to pinch pennies like this, we will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Simply superb,  classic cuisine.  Braised peek belly,  lettuce and fried green tomato sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was good and it came out pretty fast.   They were cool to serve us even though the kitchen was  closing.   We had a burger and turkey sandwich.   The portions of turkey was healthy. It was missing a few ingredients on the menu but still good.   The burger was juicy and had good char on it.   We ordered the fried spinach. It was good but a bit oily."}
{"text":"Quaint place with good food and good service. I enjoyed the wedge salad and the toasted pumpkin seed was a nice touch. I also enjoyed the pimento cheese sandwich which was huge! I ended up taking half the sandwich home with me. Adam the bartender was especially nice and he shook my hand and thanked me for being there. The next time I'm in Fort Mill, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great environment and atmosphere! Very small town, rustic feel with locally grown food. I had the Fish Po'Boy and everything was SO fresh and delicious. We also got the fried green beans and they were one of the most fabulous appetizers I've ever had. The batter was super light, as was the tartar sauce to dip them in. The menu is a little pricey, but with the food being so fresh and also local, it's understandable. The only critique I would have is that it isn't a very kid friendly menu. If you're not eating with kids, that no big deal, but if you have small, picky children like my daughter, you might not have much luck satisfying them. Overall, great experience, the staff was especially friendly!"}
{"text":"I drove 20 miles because of the good reviews looking for something unique on my first visit to South Carolina.  Show up at 9:20 pm and they tell me the kitchen just closed.   How in the world do you close your kitchen early on a Saturday night?  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I've been to local Dish twice now, and both times being equally great! This causal eatery is located in downtown Fort Mill and very close to my office, so the convenience factor is high.  The decor appears to be the original wood floors and bar located at the back of the main dinning area. The inside reminds me of a country dinner with some sophistication mixed in.    I had the farm burger which comes with homemade pimento cheese on top with lettuce, tomato, and onions. The burger was cooked perfectly and the cheese was delicious! Also the shrimp salad appeared to be very good, at least so I was told from a colleague who order it.  If your in the Fort Mill area for lunch I'd highly recommend stopping by this place. Also, it's located just 2 miles of hwy 77 (exit 85)."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are awesome and the service is great. The food prices are average but the beer is a bargain for this type of establishment. If you haven't been, you need to try it out."}
{"text":"My second visit.  Took a friend who hadn't been.  Entered through Main Street door.  Took the first table available.  A man came to our table and told us for future reference not to seat ourselves but to wait to be seated.  Awkward.  Almost left. The food made up for the rudeness.  Probably will be back.  At least put a sign up.  It was not my imagination.  My friend was offended, too."}
{"text":"Great service and a nice variety of choices on the menu. Pulled pork nachos were amazing and a must try. Fried green tomatoes were very good. Our waitress was kind and patient,  constantly refilling our drinks. So why the one star off?  The meatloaf which my father and I both ordered was bad. Maybe an off night who knows but I took one bite and then ate my wife's p.l.t. She's a team player."}
{"text":"Mmmm... perhaps I should've waited til my food coma passed to write this, but I'm feeling fat and happy!  This was the my second time to Local Dish, and it was even better than the first time.  Tucked into downtown Fort Mill, the atmosphere makes you feel like you're eating on your grandma's porch.  Ceiling fans swirl overhead and painted, wooden table and chairs sit on a wooden floor, and pictures of local farms hang via clothespin on the wall.  After reading some glowing reviews of the jalapeno lime hummus ($4), the fella and I started with that.  Y'all were right - it has a little kick to it!  That didn't stop be from eating it with a spoon when the crostinis were gone though.  After hearing a few people rave about the scallops the fella got that for his entree ($21).  His expectations were high after the recommendations... and he wasn't disappointed.  I got the PLT - braised pork belly, fried green tomato (YUM!), spinach and jalapeno aioli on a brioche bun.  Did I mention YUM?  How have I never seen this delicious combo on another menu?  The waitress came over to check on us, and I couldn't even speak to her because I didn't want to stop savoring my food.  I got it with a side of fruit - strawberries and peaches - and they were fresh and juicy... a good balance to the salty sammich.  Speaking of our waitress, she was awesome.  She checked on us just enough, gave us some suggestions for next time and did everything with a smile.  The owner even came over to thank us for coming in.  An awesome addition to Fort Mill!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, but they close whenever they feel like it ! We went there for our 31st wedding anniversary . Checked in at like 7:00 to make sure they were open until 10:00. They told us no problem to be there around 9:00 pm. We arrived at 9:03 and they said the kitchen was closed! What ? Website says 10:00! They told us 9:00 would be no problem. Well... 9:03 was not acceptable! Closed!!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood gem!  Some of the best sweet tea I have ever had and their turkey sandwich with grilled bacon and avocado is to die for.  Had their fries my first time there which were amazing and tried the fried green beans the second time which were equally worth the binge.  Can't wait to keep trying other items on the menu as I was certainly not disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best little thing on Main Street in old Fort Mill right now!  I am hesitant to give it four stars but did based on the total experience, and quality compared to most restaurants in the area (we are a little deprived in these parts!). The food was about a 3.75, but the friendly service and smart ambiance won me over.   This place is very cute and humble. Not over-decorated at all, and I applaud the owners for being tasteful and not loading this place with rusty antiques. We were greeted kindly at the door on a rainy night, and I immediately noticed that the place wasn't freezing. So many restaurants are!  We will definitely return to explore more of the menu, but decided on our first trip to sample some appetizers, after starting with a really nice South Carolina amber ale (sorry, forgot the brewer!). The kale chips (a little pricey for what they are) were interesting, I guess, but I really didn't get it. Word of caution - the jalape√±o lime hummus is good, but it's got some heat. The hummus portion is a good size big enough for four people and a good value. Fried green tomatoes (also a generous 4-slice portion) are good, with just a little bit of hollandaise.  But I've got to say that the pork belly was the highlight, and I highly recommend it!  Perfectly savory and lucious, paired with a very nice pesto, and served with two tempura-fried (all batter fried menu items are tempura-fried, a little limiting) herb cheese stuffed squash blossoms - nice touch!.   If the place really consciously makes an effort to purchase from local farmers, they should publicize it more.  Local procurement is admirable, but I don't recall seeing anything on the menu.  I do hope this place is successful. I want to try their other recipes!  Maybe even the fried chicken and waffles with bourbon syrup-oh, my!"}
{"text":"Oh man, is this place great!  The ribeye is close to the best steak I have ever had in a restaurant.  The pork chop was also really good.  Sides..perfect.  Value is definitely there.  (I've paid twice as much for worse steaks!)  Service was good and friendly.  The only slight negative...no draft beer.  They did have a nice selection of bottles, but we prefer it from the keg.  Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"This place sits in a small space in the old downtown Fort Mill but it is excellent. The chicken pot pie is really good and the shrimp and grits are even better. They don't take reservations so if you want to be seated fast I would strongly suggest going before 6. Overall, food and service are excellent and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time a couple nights ago with a girlfriend. I had read all the reviews and was being cautiously optimistic. It is Fort Mill after all. :-).  No Fancy d√©cor by any means. And it does get very loud in there however it's comfortable the service was polite. We shared the scallop dish and the salmon and I have to tell you I have eaten at a lot of places and had some incredible food in California and both of these dishes were on point. They do know what they're doing there."}
{"text":"Delightful cafe with friendly enthusiastic staff. Great selection of locally sourced Southern faves. And great bang for the buck!"}
{"text":"I came in at 8:30 at night after 8 hours of flying and so glad i found this place! I had the butternut squash gnocchi with arugula and sage chimichurri as an appetizer and the salmon over zucchini noodles in a shrimp tomato broth (i believe?). so fresh and delicious! everything cooked just right and perfectly seasoned. to top off the meal we had brown butter pecan pie and donut bread pudding with their strawberry preserve ice cream.  aside from the heavenly food, the wait staff was extremely attentive without being bothersome, knowledgable on the menu, and so incredibly friendly. do yourself a favor and try out this gem! first time in SC and this place really set the bar!"}
{"text":"Fun little joint for lunch or dinner in downtown Fort Mill.  Absolutely wonderful that all items are local and/or organic.  I recently had the Fish Po'Boy.  Very tasty.  I encourage you to try it out when driving through Fort Mill.  I just hope this starts a trend of local restaurants in the downtown area."}
{"text":"They would have gotten 4 stars anywhere else (still very good), but 5 stars for Fort Mill.  I have been waiting for a place of this quality for a while.  I had the scallops and my wife had the chicken salad.  Both amazing.  I wouldn't get the scallops to go again, I am sure they are better in-house.  Corn risotto was the best I have ever had.  We will be trying everything on the menu, for certain!"}
{"text":"Amazing little lunch spot.   Bright airy with a bar in the back of the dining area.    I arrived  shortly before the rest of my party and was seated immediately by Adam our very knowledgeable server.   He explained the butternut squash with duck confit, which sounded amazing. While the lunch is a little pricey the dinner is under priced as they are the same menu. .  I had a salmon dish that is one of their signature dishes.  Seared salmon in a shrimp broth over very fine spaghetti zucchini.   The salmon came out perfectly cooked.  Definitely a hidden gem located just outside of Charlotte."}
{"text":"So.....as usual.....some of the best food anywhere.....for an app, we had the poblano hummus, fantastic......i would put the shrimp & grits up against any chef, any restaurant, anywhere...wife had chicken and blueberry waffles, bourbon sauce....super good...if i had 1 not perfect comment?, ...it would be nice to see \"some\" new items rotate on menu....been the same for years.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different...it was Delish!! Loved it! Can't wait to go back.  I had the braised pork belly appetizer and the beet and pear salad.  Light and refreshing!"}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the fried green beans as appetizer. They were delicious to say the least. I also ordered the local burger, which was equally tasty. I noticed the salt was a bit elevated on this dish, but I figured out later on that it was the bacon and not the actual meat.  The atmosphere was excellent, the clientele looked happy and enjoying the food. I sat by the bar since the place was packed. The service was phenomenal and every single employee looked happy to be there. Drinks won't stay empty for too long and dirty dishes are quickly taken away. They have a great sense of customer service, outstanding situational awareness as every employee provides you with service regardless of whether they were your initial water/waitress.   I will return, what a jewel!"}
{"text":"Wow! Thanks Yelp! My husband and I were driving to Charleston for a long weekend and decided to look for some place unique outside of Charlotte to have dinner. We found this gem on Yelp and took a chance. What a find! Cute homey decor, and local, unique dishes! I had the shrimp pasta which was really different (artichokes, tomatoes, spinach, white wine, and shrimp that tasted really fresh). My husband had the scallops which were cooked perfectly with delicious risotto. We both shared the pork belly appetizer which was fabulous! Super friendly server as well. We both highly recommend this place and it is totally worth the 3 mile drive from the interstate!"}
{"text":"Delightful fare featuring local, fresh produce  Time: Lunch.  Ambiance: Modern organic.  Crowd: White office workers and housewives.  Menu: Attractive mix of fresh fruit and vegetable inspired dishes  Service: Attentive, but not obtrusive.  Food Ordered:  Shrimp pasta in a light tomato sauce; dill gin and tonic.  Food Quality: Wonderful.  The shrimp pasta was almost refreshing.  You could tell the sauce had been prepared with fresh ingredients.  The dill gin and tonic was almost surprisingly good.  Value: Appropriately priced."}
{"text":"PBLT (with pork) good, but not as good as a BLT :-).  Chicken salad sandwich, fried green beans and fried spinach exceptional! Can't wait to come back & try more!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Food was amazing and the service was too! So glad this little gem is close to our home!"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Got the burger with their pimento cheese on it and the fried green beans.  Both excellent.  The server was smiling and attentive even when it started getting busy."}
{"text":"A great place to eat especially if having dinner prior to a show at the Fort Mill Community Playhouse. The menu features iconic dishes such as chicken pot pie, chicken and waffles, fried green tomatoes,  fried green beans, shrimp and grits, burgers, salads,  daily soup etc. Food is plated nicely, delicious, good portion size, moderately priced. A comfortable atmosphere and friendly staff. We ordered, buffalo wings, fried green tomatoes, chicken pot pie ,roasted salmon and a cherry tomato ricotta salad. Everything was delicious. My salmon was laid in a bowl of tomato shrimp broth; unusual presentation with zucchini noodles but delicious. The pot pie in a puff pastry crust also yummy. We would certainly return again . We loved the traditional  southern food as well as unique menu choices offered."}
{"text":"This review is long in coming.  I found this place a few years ago when I was in the area for work.  I recently came back for work and had to go to Local Dish.  This place is exceptional.  I'm from the San Francisco bay area where excellent restaurants are plentiful and this place can more than hold it's own with them.  The food is fantastic, the prices are fair, the location is wonderful and the service is second to none.  I wish they were closer to me but I'll be back.  The scallops and fried green beans are to die for.  Oh and Sara is great."}
{"text":"I was recommended this restaurant by a coworker while on a work trip, and it did not disappoint! The NC trout was the best trout dish I have ever had. The sides complemented it so well and it was a large portion size. It had preserved lemon, goats milk ricotta, harissa squash that was almost sweet with a nice seared flavor, and basmati rice. Large portion size and all, I still managed to finish the whole plate and save room for dessert! I had the angel food cake with strawberries and cream, and I finished that as well. I hope to make the trip out here to eat at Local Dish again!"}
{"text":"Great aesthetics, vibe, and overall ambiance. Really enjoyed the food and the location. Nice quaint restaurant, looks to be an old hardware store or something. The fried green tomatoes....maaaaaan. Better get em' while their around because they are only seasonal. Which is great, gotta love a restaurant that supports local farmers. Also the chicken wings are gargantuan...and beyond delicious."}
{"text":"Local Dish is a classic southern restaurant. The atmosphere is casual and warm. Their Deviled Eggs are spicy and have a bit of a kick! Their 1/2 pound burger hits the spot. It includes angus beef and cheddar on a pretzel roll. My wife likes the chicken n' waffles. I also enjoy their turkey sandwich, which has avocado and bacon."}
{"text":"A little expensive, but good nonetheless.  Fun, local versions of Southern lunch and dinner items.  Friendly, informative, non-rushed waitstaff make it a pleasure to view the menu and enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to downtown Fort Mill for lunch. I loved it!  The town is quaint and has some interesting shops and from what I understand, a few great restaurants.  LOCAL DISH was a real treat.  I found out that it is locally owned and the owner was there when we lunched today.  It is a \"farm to table\" restaurant and the food tasted fresh. The menu was creative (I have posted a photo of it).  With everything from fried green beans to a beet and pear salad (and everything in between), it was ORIGINAL and not the same old stuff.  When we arrived at opening time (11:30), we were amongst the first to be seated.  The restaurant filled up quickly.  Although it became loud, it is a rather quaint space and it wouldn't take a lot of people to create a pretty high noise level.  I liked the quaint aspect, so will not fuss about the noise.   Everything else offset it.  In summary:  original food, great service, and a very cute space.   I would suggest going there and then ambling along the downtown main street to look at the other retail possibilities.  Close by in a little park, they have a few statues.  I didn't look to see who they represented, but I sensed that they weren't confederate statues, so hopefully nobody will get their panties in a wad!   Go to THE LOCAL DISH and have some fun there and in Ft. Mill!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to eat.  The food is always very fresh and very good. We live around the corner so we were thrilled when they opened their doors a few  years ago.  We have eaten almost every item on their menu now and it has all been delicious."}
{"text":"Ok so this is an update... They obviously changed the desserts because they are now HUGE, more than enough to share. Three words, Doughnut. Bread. Pudding....insanely good. I am going there for lunch in 10 minutes :)"}
{"text":"Such a fun local joint! The PLT was amazing, the pimento cheese on the local burger was good, but not overpowering. The pasta salad wasn't my favorite, a little too thick for my taste, but the fried green beans were good! Service was awesome and friendly and my husband who isn't usually into desserts really liked the chocolate chess pie."}
{"text":"Wow!!! WHAT can we say! Fantastic food and casual environment.   Pork Belly...oh rahh, Chicken Skins are better than Husk in Charleston,  Bacon wrapped scallops were perfect....check this place out.   We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love local dish.   This place is amazing and located on Main Street of Fort Mill. I have been about 4 times now and I have only gotten one dish. It is the veggie sandwich. It is so good and fresh tasting.   *I do only have one complaint. They have changed the spread on the sandwich. It used to be a ginger mayo and it was amazing. Now it is pesto, still amazing, but not as good.   The drinks are really good and decently priced as well.   It is a small restaurant with little seating. Get there early or have a reservation.   The staff are very nice and the kitchen staff come and visit your table. :D"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to going  here with all the good reviews.  I was sadly disappointed.  I had the pork chop which was overcooked and very dry, I tried to finish it and couldn't.  My father had the meatloaf and said it was very bland.  My son had fries with his meal and they were overcooked almost to the point of being very burnt.  The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because the staff was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Super impressed with this quaint, yet sophisticated restuarant! Atmosphere is very welcoming, easy going and homey, you can dress up or go in jeans and t-shirt. And the menu is amazingly sophisticated, yet absolutely delicious in a simple way. Service was not only quick, but very attentive and well mannered. Just an all around great place! Also a bonus that it's Farm to Table and the buy local. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Who knew this place would be here in down town Fort Mill. Through a recommendation from a co-worker I decided to give this place and I am glad I did. If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try. Probably not the best for large groups though."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through a friend so my wife and I decided to give it a try. Very glad we did! They have some of the best scallops and risotto I've ever tasted. They need to step it up as far as the desserts go but everything else was fine."}
{"text":"Love local dish! One of our favorite spots in fort mill. Fried green beans are a must. Chicken pot pie is amazing (if you can get before they sell out!) and their specials are always delicious."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant in downtown Fort Mill serving up some quality food.  I have only eaten here twice but I will be back for more and hopfully often. I had Shrimp Fettucini Alfredo both times because it was so good the first I had to get more.   Try it out as I think most people will really like this place."}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating at Local Dish.  A few weeks ago my husband and I took our family there who were visiting the Charlotte area.  They loved it!  I love the small eclectic atmosphere that they have going on.   I love their shrimp and grits.  I dream about those shrimp and grits.  They are amazing!  Def. get them if you are a fan of shrimp and grits.    I can't say anything about their drink selection as I have been pregnant every time that we have been there.  The doughnut bread pudding is amazing!  LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a deeply enjoyable meal at this casual sweet little restaurant.  The food is impeccable; incredible flavors, carefully executed dishes each with their own personality. The pulled pork on the Pork Nacho's is among the best I've ever eaten & my dear friend who rarely eats pork was won over in spades.  The head on peel & eat shrimp were perfection. Lovely texture, cook & seasoning completely spot on. The Fried Green Tomatoes were moist & crunchy & delicate all at once.  After these appetizers my husband moved on to the Shrimp & Grits, and oh my those grits are cheesy heaven. I devoured the Chicken Pot Pie which was thick & creamy inside, very very rich and yummy. Our friends had the spinach salad with grilled chicken & massive meatloaf. My son raved about the chicken & waffle. Arrive a few minutes before they open to avoid a wait that grows longer quickly. The service is excellent & the atmosphere cozy."}
{"text":"Lazy Saturday afternoon, rain has stopped and dammit I'm hungry!  Since I pass by this place virtually everyday on my commute back and forth to work, I figured let's stop and have lunch.  Nothing seems to last very long in Downtown Fort Mill, so get in while it's open.  Great concept right?  Local, Southern fresh, farm to table type cuisine all makes for a great lead in.  Walk in to a cute, homey type feel with hardwood floors, decent chairs, I sit down at the table and the first thing that grabs me is the \"mini towels\" as napkins which signifies to me that things are about to get messy.  The decor was simple, with cool pictures of veggies and local stuff that was the antithesis of the Cracker Barrel.  I skipped breakfast and was pretty hungry, so onto the ordering!  Our waiter, Kyle was quick to show up with a menu and offer for drinks.  I asked him about the Pulled Pork Nachos which he said it was his favorite thing on the menu.  Kyle, you are a menu pickin' fool my new friend!!  These damn nachos were the best, let me repeat best, nachos I have ever eaten. Slow cooked shredded pork tossed with a hearty BBQ sauce, pico de gallo, melty cheddar cheese, black beans and nicely topped with a pepper cream sauce.  The combination of flavors were such that a smile immediately came to my face and didn't go away until the bowl was clean.  It was a great portion and I started to think about when I would be able to come back and have them again.  Remember the Dad in \"A Christmas Story\" won the \"major award\" and it was the Leg Lamp?  These nachos are deserving of an award that major!  Kids had the kids portion of fried shrimp and chicken.  They were tempura battered and the shrimp were the kind that were fresh caught from the coast, not the typical \"kids platter\" of fried crap that just fell off the Sysco truck.  The breading had a nice spice to it and I was delighted when my daughter informed me she was full and I ate the rest of what was on her plate.  The service was attentive and spot on.  I asked for some hot sauce and he brought me some hot sauce from the place next door, which was good and way too hot for my pansy ass.    This lunch was absolutely wonderful.  I am glad I tried it since I will be a frequent repeat customer.  This is the type of place that as I was calculating the tip on my bill I was already planning my next trip.  See you soon Guys!!!"}
{"text":"Been there four times. Each time its gotten a little worse. Seems like smaller portions and the quality is diminished by rushed service in the kitchen. Most recently, hamburger that was so salty it was ridiculous, 20 minute wait for the next try. my wife's Salmon couldn't have weighted 3 OZs and was well done. Again, the perception of problems in the kitchen. We're going to take a break from the Local Dish for a while"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Fort Mill and it's the place I go to for my southern comfort food. So fresh and delicious. The waiters and staff are always so nice and helpful. The guy who owns the place though is always a little sour. He should smile more. Lol."}
{"text":"This was the first time there and won't be the last. It is a \"hot spot\" for the locals as there is generally a good wait for a table, but I'll say it is well worth it, and we made the trip fro Charlotte.  All the good to great reviews you read have said it all. The food, not matter what you order is GREAT.  We started with the sausage dip app. Only issue there was not given enough chips, but they always brought more on request.  I had the chicken pot pie, the wife had the pork chop and son had the meat loaf. The in-laws were with us and she had the pork chops and he had the scallops. All dishes were great and clean plates were taken away.   We finished with multiple desserts but the winner had to be the doughnut bread pudding. What a way to finish!   The only disappointment was that I wanted the chicken and waffles, but the waffle maker had died."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. We specifically chose this restaurant after looking at new homes in  Fort Mill and were told to try this local eatery. We arrived right as they opened on a Saturday for lunchtime. We were seated immediately, but before we were able to order the waiter quickly told my mother-in-law that no outside beverages were allowed in the restaurant. This we all found to be a little unnecessary as she was not drinking the bottle of juice, simply had sat it on the table as we had just been seated. Then when we went to order the waiter informed us they were out of the \"special\" of the day, the meatloaf. We ask about another entree on the menu and the waiter could not tell us exactly what was in the dish. When we finally ordered, the food was good, but definitely nothing special.  There is limited parking as the restaurant is located in a historic downtown area. The atmosphere within the restaurant is very relaxed and casual and it is obvious they have a regular crowd and then those that happen to stop in to dine.  Overall, the experience definitely left me and my family unimpressed. The service was fair to poor, the meal was ok, but with a waitstaff that did not have the knowledge of what was on the menu and the general ingredients left me far from impressed. The restaurant, in my opinion, catered to a specific local audience, had no true customer service due to the lack of competition within the area and unless I have a reason specifically to be in the area I will not give them a second chance. I realize, everyone has a bad day, but in the service industry a bad day causes lost customers."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I do not like southern food despite living in the south and loving it. I might have changed my mind after eating here!  Very popular spot with the locals, there it will be a wait and it will be worth it. I went with two small children and the service was still perfect. Everyone treat you like family the dishes are a little pricey but probably the best food I've had in South Carolina. The scallops and risotto were absolutely wonderful. My wife had the filet and it was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork! The dessert is to die for! Farm to table food with a cozy and friendly ambiance on the Main St.  I would give it a six star review if I could!"}
{"text":"We love going to Local Dish for some great food in a comfortable atmosphere. Everything we've had has been great, but I was somewhat disappointed with the wedge salad. It seemed a little bland. The shrimp on top of it, however, were delicious. The price point is fair for a non-chain, but is on the higher end for Fort Mill. Overall we really enjoy it and it's one of the places we take out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Big fan of mom and pop places. Avoid chains at all cost. Cozy inviting small town atmosphere. Server was engaging and attentive without being over bearing. Stopped in for a lite lunch. Had the apple / beet salad with chicken. Perfect. I could not help but look at what others were getting. Everything looked great. Definitely will head back."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I LOVE this place!  The people are friendly & have personality & the food,... GREAT!  Definitely going again.  I was invited to dinner by my sister and have never been-moved to the south in October of 2011.  I had the pot pie, (was planning on saving some for lunch the next day, didn't happen) and I must say it's the BEST I have ever had & the dessert....well no contest!  The staff is fantastic and the place is inviting in every way.  Cozy inside & welcoming.  Everything my sister and her family ordered looked amazing.  My mom had the chicken and waffles...I should have tasted it, she said it was good! Can't wait to go back!  The menu has a lot to offer and will most likely go there soon for take out or invite some friends for a time out! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Down home comfort food done elegantly with class and modesty. I think they have something really special going on in there.  Reasonable prices. I sat at the bar and had an enjoyable meal with a craft beer while I was chatted up by a fellow patron and a gentleman behind the bar who I think is the owner.  I read some reviews that indicated that the service was sub par but I witnessed only high quality service all around.  The ambiance is casual but not cheesy or low class.  If I am ever in the area again, I will most certainly visit this fine restaurant again."}
{"text":"I am originally from fort mill area and am thrilled that such a fun unique place has done so well in this town! From great food and a unique menu that offers something for everyone I am certain that this will be a place that I frequent! The service is exceptional and I can't wait to be back! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My wife wanted us to try this place for a while and we finally pulled the trigger tonight. Great atmosphere... small room. Right on the main street in Fort Mill. Very unassuming place with lots of charm.  She ordered the shrimp and grits and loved it! I tasted it and concurred. It was fantastic. I got the meatloaf because I was hungry and was afraid one of the other dishes would be too small... and man did it fill me up. The meatloaf was tasty but a tad dry.. so I asked our server to bring some gravy... he scared up gravy which I think is used for the braised short ribs and it did the trick! They should actually serve the meatloaf like that... I needed to find their suggestion box! The mushroom risotto and collards that accompanied the meatloaf were superb.  Contrary to an earlier review on here, they do have a kids menu.. you just have to ask your server. My four year old had that pasta and she liked it! They also offered chicken/shrimp/fish, fried or grilled and a grilled cheese for kids.  Since both my wife and I are counting calories right now, we had to turn down what sounded the like the most awesome dessert in the area: donut bread pudding with a salted caramel sauce... when I'm down another 20 lbs, I'll indulge on a \"cheat\" evening!!"}
{"text":"Local Dish is always great. They have a really great menu with some very unique items. The Pulled Pork Nacho appetizer is killer. For entrees, I usually get the pork chop or the scallops. They are both fantastic.  The food is always prepared with great attention to detail.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice decor, love the fact that it is local foods..which is why we went.  Staff was very friendly, food came out quickly, beers where from local brewers...Sweet Potato Gnocchi was very good, my wife got the pork chops and I got the angus burger.  My burger was good, would have liked it to be a bit more juicy and flavorful, but maybe it was just healthier than other burgers so it didn't have the grease and fat.  I would definitely go back, maybe try a different entree."}
{"text":"A fun local place with amazing food. The chicken and waffles were delicious.  The drinks were just as good.  Staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Spur of the moment date night turned into an epic culinary journey.  The salmon deserves a Michelin star on its own.  Short ribs changed my life.  Bread pudding and homemade ice cream put the perfect cap on this amazing evening."}
{"text":"Eat a pork belly sandwich. I promise it won't kill you. I'm still here to tell the tale of its goodness. And boy oh boy, is it good!  Try to get here early or be prepared to wait. It can get hoppin quick."}
{"text":"Unexpected find! The burger and pork belly sandwhich were......fresh and overall delicious."}
{"text":"This place is really good!!  Had the chicken and waffle....  OMG.  The staff are very nice.  Adam the bartender was great.    The only thing is that the place is TINY!!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Very quaint and great food. Especially the chicken pot pie and scallops! Service was very quick. Stopped to visit with a friend we haven't seen in years and this was the perfect spot. It is a little loud but the restaurant was full so I understand."}
{"text":"We always like to find local restaurants while traveling. I found this little place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It was by far the best place Yelp has ever sent us. We had the shrimp pasta, scallops and risotto and the local pimiento burger and all were 5 stars. I personally ate the scallop dish and it was by far one of my favorite dishes of all time. I would make a trip back to Rock Hill just to eat here again."}
{"text":"Nothing I ate was spectacular. But I will add that many of the things I were looking for were not available. I'll give it another try in the fall to see if they have greens and that peach breach pudding that called my name when looking at the reviews.   To be specific about the food I did try...  The salad with the pickled watermelon rind had a really good flavor but the chicken was a bit dry.  The meatloaf was ok - Ira bacon wrapped which should add more flavor. I'd recommend a \"weaved\" bacon wrap to hold in more of the juices.  The soup of the day was VERY salty and should not have been served at all.  The service was 5 Stars and most certainly the reason I'll be going back to try the fall menu. Look at for updated review."}
{"text":"First time I came here I got a shrimp po boy grilled. Shrimp was tender and the tartar sauce complemented well with it. I got a side of pasta salad to go with it. Pasta salad was a little different for me. It didn't have a lot of flavor and it was really oily.   We all split the jalapeno lime hummus and it was just delicious. I think it's just a seasonal flavor but they should really bring it back!! It was good and spicy and zesty all at the same time!!  Second time we got a to go order. I got the buffalo wings from the appetizer section. They are fried and then grilled. I got the traditional buffalo flavor. I was intrigued by it because I've never had wings fried and grilled. Texture was good. Flavor was also good. Wings were pretty big. I got it with ranch and you can tell the ranch was homemade. It was thick and delicious!! I got a side of fruit with my wings. It came with sliced green apples and blueberries.   My coworker got the pork nachos and thought they were delicious. It's a large portion and great to share. Two other people got grilled shrimp salads and they loved it.   We got the country style gravy with sausage dip. We were really curious about it so we decided to order it. It came with tortilla chips. Dip doesn't look good but trust me, it's good. It's white based. It had small chunks of sausage in it. It was good and slightly spicy which I like. Dip was thick and it was just great with chips. Of course it's not the healthiest but it's not so bad when you split it with 3 other people. :)   FYI their sweet tea is on point too!"}
{"text":"Excellent little local place in fort mill. I had the scallops wife had pot pie. We ordered nachos and pulled pork for appetizer. Everything was top notch, well cooked, and excellent tasting. Highly recommend for food, ambiance, and quality. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Love love! This is a wonderful place to eat right in the middle of dead downtown! I had 2 baby showers here and eat here very often, once 3 times in a week!! I love everything I've had on the menu!! Service is excellent, food is good and the sweet tea is great!! Great place to bring visitors from out of town as well!!! The best local restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the area. Fresh, personalized food. Attention to detail in the food that is served and service to tables. We had an amazing experience (chicken pot pie and a turkey sandwich). Will come back over and over!!!   Also the restaurant had two poke stops for any Pokemon go players !!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Always enjoy our food. Service has always been good. Sometimes there's a wait but hey we're adults. We can wait our turn"}
{"text":"Really good southern style cooking in a quaint atmosphere.  Only been for lunch and liked everything I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just got done eating lunch here with my husband and some friends. I can honestly say this will be added to our list of favorite places to eat and take friend's and family to.   I got the chicken and waffle and it was the best I've ever had. The chicken is tempura fried and so tender and crispy. The waffle was the perfect complement to it. It wasn't too sweet and had little bits of apples throughout and a delicious bourbon syrup.   My husband got the shrimp and grits and enjoyed every bite. He said it was the perfect amount and that the stump were delicious.   Our friends both got salads and were very impressed with those as well."}
{"text":"Hello food coma.  Love this place.  Here on business and sat in the Ruby Tuesday parking lot thinking: 1/2 mile to hotel. Or go find great food.  Great food won and I landed at Local Dish.    Started with the house salad.  No frills.  Lots of great crispy fresh greens. Watermelon vinaigrette that was not sweet, thank god.  Simple and good.    Onto the filet (cooked perfectly rare) with carrot risotto and braised baby bok choy.  Amazing. Polished it off.    And then the dessert.  Which I rarely eat but tonight I craved sweetness and I certainly got it.  Donut bread pudding.  This ain't your grandma's bread pudding.  So rich.  So delicious.  So happy for the big serving that will accompany me on the plane back west tomorrow morning.    Kerry my waitress was amazing.  Courteous friendly and decisive.  Fantastic all around.    If you don't eat here while nearby you are missing out for sure."}
{"text":"If you want fresh food this is your place! There was a bit of a wait for lunch...but not for long. That's an indication how great the food is. Had shrimp pasta yum and my husband had the burger with real sliced peaches on the side. I like how the tables are spread out so you're not sitting with the guy behind you. Great fast service. No complaints except it's very noisy."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the service is impeccable and food and amazing! The pork chop, meatloaf, ribeye and mushroom risotto is to die for. The pork belly appetizer is so good everyone in Charlotte and Fort Mill needs to try it. The braising liquid they use should be marketed. Even the sides are spot on. It's a small place, so be patient and polite. They'll get to you as soon as they can. They also infuse their own liquor with veggies like cucumber and cherries. Just know you're in for a southern, down home, slow cooked, friendly treat when you visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch. My pulled pork sandwich was delicious and service was quick. Highly recommend! Just be aware that they're closed for lunch after 2:30pm. A lot of options at the bar too"}
{"text":"Always looking for the right combination of food, price, service and atmosphere.  This place checks all the boxes.  Pork belly beet fennel and pumpkin seed appetizer was awesome, as were the fried vegetable chips and chicken wings.  Drinks were reasonably priced, friendly service and right across street from new brewery.  Easily the best restaurant I've been to in the Fort Mill area.  We didn't try the entrees yet but don't have many doubts.  This place could be in Charlotte, charge 25% more and do great."}
{"text":"This was the best restaurant I've ever eaten at in terms of food quality. It should have a Michelin Star."}
{"text":"Keeps getting better with age.  I have introduced this Resturant to several people and everyone LOVES this place.   I go here weekly and the staff is the best group of service folks I know.   I call them friends and I think they feel the same."}
{"text":"So good!!! I had the pulled pork nachos. The  best I have every had. Must go!! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food from a local business. Wish they had a kids portions or we would be there much more often. That is probably by design anyway. :)."}
{"text":"Overall this place was great! The people were super nice but know you will wait on a weekend. My only issue is how the restaurant is setup there isn't much room for all the people waiting. We were sat within the timeframe given and served promptly. Their cider margarita was awesome. We got two appetizers the pork belly and the sweet potato gnocchi. Both were good we liked the gnocchi better as the sauce was seasoned well. For dinner I got the short rib and my husband the chicken pot pie. The short rib was ok compared to other restaurants I have had it at. It was very large portion and reminded me of a roast with gravy my mom use to make. The pot pie was really good and would recommend. Overall good experience and will return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now, and both times it has been a wonderful experience. The menu changes often because they make it according to what is in season. The pork belly appetizer was amazing (both times). Each time was a different preparation (again, seasonal), but AWESOME. I also saw pumpkin hummus listed under the appetizer list this time. I thought \"huh, I've never heard of that before.\" So, I got it, and it was really good. I also tried the chicken n' waffles. The chicken was cooked perfectly, but overall, it wasn't that above the average from what you would expect from chicken n' waffles. They also have good ice cream."}
{"text":"Man, I hope this place stays open forever! The food is very good, atmosphere is fun and quirky, and reasonably priced for the quality of the meal! If you want a to have a nice plated dinner with your \"special someone\", this is a solid choice!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a workout.  Small sweet and unfussy place.  Food blew me away! My sister had scallops and Brussels sprouts.  I had shrimp and grits and we shared bread pudding.  I am well traveled and have had Michelin experiences that weren't this good.  Run don't walk to this hidden gem!!!!Service was excellent and the food was exceptional.  Best meal I've had in months and I dined at a the Palm last Tuesday.  Enjoy!  You're welcomed by the way (I know you will thank me) lol!"}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service! Not enough good can be said about this place. It is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone in the local area and beyond!"}
{"text":"Cute, kitschy little place. Pleasant server, quick service, and delicious fresh food. I had the pork belly appetizer. Delicious! Tender, unctuous pieces of salty, fatty pork that was like butter. The charred cabbage was a perfect side that complemented the sweetness of the pork. The only thing I didn't like is that the butternut squash comes cold. Other than that, it was so good. Baldie had the Local Dish burger. He didn't like that the pimento cheese was cold, but it has to be. We're such New Yorkers! The brioche roll was soft and delicious and the burger was top quality beef cooked to perfection. Fries were good, too. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Never disappoints! This local family owned restaurant made me and my husband fall in love with Fort Mill.   Service is always friendly and welcoming. You have to try the specials and the Meatloaf with Mushroom Risotto is my favorite. Don't forget the BBQ Nachos I could live on those.   We need to support great place like this GEM!!"}
{"text":"This is a great local place! The ambiance is very relaxed - unpresuming with a really nice bartender who makes you feel like you should become a \"regular\"! The food is farm to table style nothin stuffy just good old fashioned yummy food. I like the sandwiches, fried green beans, shrimp and grits and the specialty cocktails.   This place is great for a casual date night or dinner with a small group. I hope fort Mill opens up more places like this!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch while visiting family. The pork nachos were awesome!!!  This will be a most stop when we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Food and Service.  I had the Scallops with Risotto and Crispy Spinach. Amazing Pairing and my tummy is very happy.   Def coming back."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding and it being in \"Small Town\" Fort Mill was pretty cool to see. I had the steak, my friend had the pork chop and the wife had chicken and waffles. All were cooked perfect and the flash fried green beans were great."}
{"text":"Fantastic locally sourced restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. The list of amazing dishes goes on and on (meatloaf, steak, pulled pork nachos, kale chips, and chicken and waffles). Service is consistently happy and ready to make sure you have a terrific dining experience."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits this side of Charleston. Homemade dessert. Very southern yet gourmet."}
{"text":"Ambience=cool and casual. Staff=friendly, attentive, and charismatic. A cozy place with great southern fare. Tonight I stopped in for the first time to enjoy a dessert and coffee. I have officially found a new \"place to take people\". You know those places you keep in your back pocket for when business associates are in town or friends are close by. The local place they won't be able to get back home that really shows off some of the best food this area has to offer. Yeah, this is the place. The menu has a great balance of comfort, exotic, and classic dishes. The pies, ice cream, and puddings are made in house. The flavors are wonderful. You can see right into their quaint but busy kitchen. And watch the cooks work their magic. The dining room is small, but the tables aren't super cramped like some smaller joints like to do. I really don't have anything to complain about. Only good things to say. If you don't get to the local dish, you are missing big time. You have been warned."}
{"text":"***Extremely LOUD, but If your looking for incredible food and great service, this is your location: my wife had the salmon with a side salad and I had the meatloaf with a blue cheese wedge- perfectly cooked. Our waiter, Kyle, was awesome as well. The only think that brought this restaurant from a 5 star to a 4 star, was the sound. If you are on a date and you want to hear each other, forget about it.  Acoustics are ridiculous-very loud restaurant. My wife and I gave up, laughed at each other and had another beer- just couldn't hear each other at all sitting right across the table- my head hurt when we left. As a multi-restaurant owner and executive chef-my recommendation are 2 things-add egg crates to reduce sound Carry and add a sauce to the meatloaf, maybe a balsamic reduction? It needs a little love- still good and moist, just lacking an acid. (I've been here for lunch as well-forget a business meeting- you can't hear each other with the noise level!)"}
{"text":"After seeing an article in the Fort Mill times, we tried this place out today, and I was very pleased!  The PLT was very tasty, with moist pork belly, and a tempura-fried green tomato. Lots of flavor! A little overwhelmed by the big bun, but it was a fresh, homemade bun, so that's a plus. The fruit side was fresh and local (the waitress told us where they bought the peaches).  I think the pulled pork nachos are my new favorite thing in town.  The chips were large and hearty, so they didn't break under the weight of the savory pork, black beans, and cheese.  Definitely big enough to share. I really liked the decor, as well--light and airy! And heck, I can walk there from home--and will.  Looking forward to trying the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"Saturday night @7:00 was busy but we snagged 2 seats at the bar with a view of the kitchen. Adam was hosting the bar. Started with 2 cocktails that were delicious, Southern Mule and raspberry Lemonade.  Started with the Braised Pork Belly appetizer.  With squash and watermelon. Perfect.   I had the chicken and waffles.  A real twist on soul food.  Tempura fried chicken on a blueberry waffle with bourbon syrup. Unbelievably good.   My wife had the chicken pot pie.  Truly delicious and not what you expect.   Finished by splitting the toasted pound cake with fruit and fresh whipped cream.   A true gem in Fort Mill. Not to mention 3 drinks, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees and a dessert for $60 before tax?    We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were in town for the Spartan Beast race. We were trying to find a local restaurant with South Carolina BBQ, but happened to find this place on yelp. As we drove to main street and it looked dead and pitch black, except for the light emanating from Local Dish. It was packed with people too, so that was a good sign. We walked inside the modest looking diner and asked for a table for 4. They didn't have anything for another 15 minutes or so and had us sit at the bar in the meantime. The bartender was the coolest dude. Offering us some recommendations and chatting us up.    We were seated in no time and our waitress was friendly and very accommodating. The menu was full of lip smacking delicious vittles. There are no pictures on the menu, but everything sounded good! Porkbelly, pulled pork nachos, shrimp and grits Yes, We ordered those things and were not disappointed.   This is also the first non-Asian cuisine joint that I have seen with chicken skin on the menu. Fried chicken skin. So crispy and delicious! The Pork belly was blackened on the outside and bacony on the inside, served on top of roasted corn, lettuce and a hot sauce.  The Pulled pork nachos were composed of fingerlickin BBQ pulled pork (of course), fresh pico de gallo, and smothered with cheeses.   And those were just the appetizers. I ordered the shrimp and grits. I've had shrimp and grits at other places and it came out a little different. Here the shrimp was in a cheesy sause with mushrooms and peas, smothered over the top of the grits, almost very soup-like. And I finished the bowl and licked it clean.   My com-padres had the bacon cheesburger (it looked gourmet), the fried shrimp sandwich, and fried fish sandwich. Everything was good. I asked the waitress for some hot sauce and she brings out three bottle of various peppers and level or heat. All from the the Puckerbutt company.  One of which had habeneros. She gave me a warning, and I proceeded to drip them on my food. I have a high tolerance for spice so none of them made my butt pucker, but they were still pretty dam good.   This place is a gem! If you are in this area, you should definitely stop to eat here. I can't imagine that you'd be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Smaller, well done menu that you really can't go wrong with. Wait staff are personable and fun. If you show up more than once, bartender Adam will remember your name and probably your drink."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I had not found this place before now, but am very thankful I did. It is easily my favorite restaurant in Fort Mill.   Went on Saturday evening for dinner and was absolutely thrilled by everything. The atmosphere is very simple but very comfortable and the service was awesome. We had at least 5 different people at our table throughout the night including the chef.   We had the cheese fondue appetizer which is very good (they will bring you additional toasted bread, but we asked and received nacho chips which were also very good). My wife had the Shrimp Pesto which was excellent and the serving was not monstrous, but plenty w/ big chunks of artichokes and tomatoes along with many large shrimp. I had the Dish Burger and it rocked!! It may have been the BEST burger I have ever eaten and I am not kidding - I eat a lot of burgers and this one was simple but incredible. It was a large patty, w spinach leaves (not my favorite, but different and way better than lettuce and tomato), thick slices of bacon and pimento cheese on a bun that tasted like a newly made soft pretzel. The hand cut fries were also very good and plentiful.   My wife and I both kept waiting for something to be less than perfect, but we were pleasantly surprised when the excellence continued right up to and including when the bill came.   We had a pumpkin cheesecake (which I typically am not a cheesecake fan, but it was excellent) and even though they do not have any draught beer, they had a limited but eclectic mix including Dos Equis Amber (one of my favorites) as well as my wife's favorite, Blue Moon.   I was very pleasantly surprised at the total of my bill when it came as well.  I hesitate to tell anyone about this place since it is small (probably seats about 100 folks total) because I would hate for it to become so well known that there would be long waits, but I certainly do not want it to go away either, so....  There is no place better than Local Dish in Fort Mill or Rock Hill and it would give most of the restaurants in Charlotte a run for their money.   Do yourself a favor and go see if I have exaggerated. I promise you will enjoy the experience!"}
{"text":"Dad & I went to dinner on a Saturday evening around 5:40PM, we had a 20 minute wait.  My dad ordered a lamb fennel soup and I had the beet salad.  Both appetizers had a hint of spice and were seasoned perfectly.  The main meal for dad was Chicken & Waffle.   I had the Scallops w/ mushroom risotto, fried shishito's & red beet coulis.  We didn't want it to end, the food is that good.  In the past we've also had Hanger Steak, Braised Beef, Salmon.  You can't go wrong.  Also the wings, burgers & sides are amazing.  There is something here for everyone.  They also have Gluten Free options."}
{"text":"Hubby and I visited a couple days ago. It was packed on a Saturday night (~30 minute wait), but the evening was pleasant so we walked around a bit. We shared an appetizer (I forget the name, but flavorful bread with roasted shallot, fruit compote, and herbed goat cheese) and the bacon wrapped meatloaf with mash/gravy and collard greens with hamhocks. The bread and accouterments were extremely flavorful and the collards and mash were to DIE for! The meatloaf was a bit salty for my taste, but it grew on the mister after a while. All that said, it was a solid spot and we will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love to eat here any chance we can. If you enjoy great food and clean eating this is the place to eat. The food is fresh, small location, but a great portion of food that has you longing to come back! The pimento cheese on sourdough with a side of crispy spinach hits the spot every time. Not to mention the desserts are yummy as well!"}
{"text":"Super delicious.  Great service.  And I'm always looking for a reason to return.  The chicken basil sandwich is amazing.  And the hummus is super delicious."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem in fort mill. Great quality and presentation and the flavor combos are well put together. Be sure you get here early for lunch because the place fills up fast."}
{"text":"This place was really good. The wall decorations really fit the atmosphere. It's very popular. The lamb was really good and at a good price. The fried green beans were excellent. The pulled pork sauce wasn't great.   My only real knock on the place is it's really loud and can be difficult to have conversation."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Absolutely delicious. Great service. Accurate pricing if you want some excellent food!   I had the NC trout. Simply Devine. I will return ASAP."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.  It reminds me of the type of hidden gems you find when you go to the mountains...like Blowing Rock, The Highlands, or Chimney Rock.  It is a perfect cafe with a solid menu, friendly service and in a nice spot in downtown Fort Mill.  I tried the Turkey, bacon, avocado sandwich with a side of fruit.  The hubs...shockingly (not) ordered the pimento cheese burger served with fries.   The burger was on point and it had bacon on it!  The cheese was melting into the patty and the burger was nice and hearty.  The fries were long, thick and crispy...very good!!  The service was laid back and friendly and you can tell that it is a local favorite.  It just has a happy vibe.  I loved it.    I don't venture out to downtown Fort Mill often but what a perfect lunch spot after hiking, biking or walking around the greenway!  If you find yourself in the area, definitely stop in!"}
{"text":"Best Restaurant in Fort Mill! Quaint atmosphere with gourmet food that will not disappoint. Friendly bar tender & servers who have worked here for years. The owner John must be a great guy to work for. He is always around."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Especially the PLT. The atmosphere is a bit hectic though. It needs to grow a bit in my opinion and get some beer on tap. Great service though and food."}
{"text":"Excellent!  This is one of the best restaurants in the area.  Small bar to enjoy a drink / wait for a table.  Speaking of which... not many tables.  But worth the wait as I am guessing there is usually such.  We went on a Tuesday night and got there relatively early... a little before 6.  We waited for our entire party (total of 6 men) to arrive before we sat.  We needed 2 tables pushed together but the staff would not allow that unless the whole party was there.  By the time they arrived, there was only 1 table left so we were a little cramped but we didn't allow that to take away from the experience.  And, we get the policy.  Plus, the staff is out of their way friendly.  Apps... all were excellent... we got the Pulled Pork Nachos and Fried Green Beans. The green beans had the perfect amount of breading and the nachos had ample toppings and none of that \"movie theater fake cheese\" like you get at a lot of places.  :-)   We didn't get the wings, but someone near us did and they looked fantastic.  Definitely getting them next time!  I got the Local Dish Burger and it was too big to finish.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the toppings were ample.  I got the hand cut fries and they were fantastic.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Fort Mill from Texas and this was the first restaurant we tried. The food was great and service was attentive and friendly...the noise level was frustrating. The restaurant is really cute but small and so loud.  I'd still go back, just wish you could talk and relax since it's such a great place otherwise.  My daughter and I had the chicken and waffles-delicious!! My husband had the pulled pork sandwich and said it was really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally checked out this place after hearing about it only a couple weeks ago.  The idea of a cute storefront restaurant on Main Street intrigued us.  We went on a weeknight and found the place surprisingly full - there were only five (of about 15-20) tables available when we arrived.  However, we were quickly seated and provided with our requested drinks.  We had pork bellies and kale chips for our appetizers.  The pork bellies were divine.  The kale chips were a bit lacking in flair.  It was basically dry kale with paprika sprinkled on top.  Not much else.  My husband got the Local Dish burger and declared it good.  The fries he got on the side were great.  I ordered their chicken & peaches sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I could have eaten more than the serving they gave me.  The chicken sandwich was average - but I loved knowing I was probably eating peaches from just a few blocks away at the Peach Stand.  The chicken itself was a bit dry but was helped by the pesto, spinach and peaches that came on it.  Why did I not give it more than 3 stars?  Because a second visit will be required, with other foods tried, before I decide to bump it up to four stars.  The restaurant was charming enough (and prices decent enough) that we'll most likely go back again the future."}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped in for lunch from just driving from VA. We both decided on the shrimp and grits. The best shrimp and grits EVER!   They were so good we took another to go!!"}
{"text":"Good fresh food.  Meatloaf was my husband's favorite. The way they did the corn side dish was yummy. Loved the chicken salad sandwich.  Nice homey atmosphere. Definite new favorite."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem thanks to Yelp - I was in town for a business meeting and needed to find some dinner. I ordered the salmon over zucchini noodles in a tomato broth - OMG can I just tell you it was freaking amazing. I wanted to lick my plate clean. The staff was friendly, service good.. parking easy... good wine. Next time I'm at HQ I will be stopping in to see what they have on the menu. I've been telling my co-workers to make it a point to stop in!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices, and very comfortable atmosphere.  Great menu, hard to find anything not to like."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing from the fried green beans to the shrimp po boy to the grilled chicken with grilled peaches sandwich. The service is always wonderful. I can't wait to try dinner."}
{"text":"Greatly enjoyed the service & the ambiance at Local Dish...the food was fantastic!!   It's so nice when the business lives up to it's rave reviews...as we are aware it does not always happen. Moreover, our expectations become much higher than the norm that perhaps our expectations become unrealistic!? Either way Local Dish is very worthy of it's current rating. #kudos   Their cabbage chopped salad (added chicken) is seriously probably the BEST I have had in quite sometime. Their blue cheese dressing catapults the overall flavors and places it on the \"memorable\" list!  #phenomenal   My husband ordered the chicken & waffles, the waffle was crispy, therefore the texture was perfect. The \"ONLY\" thing we both were not crazy about was the tempera style fried chicken. It was great tasting & the chicken was moist although we prefer good old traditional style fried chicken.   Our server was extremely accommodating and friendly. The interior and window decor is easy on the eyes and adds to the homey down to earth feel that certainly is relaxing.   Can't wait to return to try their chicken pot pie & desserts.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch, and wish they had one in Charlotte proper since it's only convenient to get for Lunch since of the commute. Great southern options for great value."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Superb food! Sweeet Potato Gnocchi was the stand-out dish of the table. Shrimp & grits - a close second.  Very affordable meal given the quality. 2 drinks, an app & an entree for $35! Maybe things are cheaper in SC than Philadelphia? Was so glad Yelp helped me find this place. Will only be in this area for a week but I can see myself coming back to try the meatloaf. Or the salmon. There were so many items on the menu that turned me on. PS the waitresses are cute :)"}
{"text":"Really neat restaurant. Original wood floors and bar.  I had the fried green tomatoes which could have been seasoned.  Also the shrimp and grits were very filling and creamy, just like Grandma used to make.  This dish did have andouille sausage which took over a bit too much.  I was in the mood for seafood and the sausage was a bit much.  Waiter seemed a bit dim, the acoustics make it loud.  I would be proud to take any out if tower here!"}
{"text":"Local dish is a bright spot in downtown Fort Mill. Ingredients are  from local farms, Pimento cheese sandwich and meatloaf are couple of good dishes. There is fair size bar as well."}
{"text":"Wow. This places was awesome. My wife and I were looking for something a little different, we found Local Dish thanks to our Yelper community. I was concerned about getting a table on a Saturday night, but we walked right in and sat at 1 of 2 available tables. The place is kind of small. The waiter said it was unusually not busy that evening. i noticed that the crowd was perfect, just enough crowd to keep almost all tables full, but never requiring anyone to wait.  The atmosphere is very nice, almost cozy. Not fancy by any means, but also not diner-ish. They strike a perfect balance. It is kid friendly also, but probably if your kids are really loud, might not be the best  place. Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable. Don't you love it when you go to a place and everything you pick is validated by the waiter as \"Great choice!\", and he really seems sincere! He recommended several items and directed us well.  The first thing on our mind was the fried green beans as an appetizer, but it was a fail. Today's truck didn't run, so they were out. The waiter directed us to the root chips with goat cheese. This was a perfect app, very tasty, but not too filling.  They have a nice selection of drinks here, including local craft beers. OMB, Sierra Nevada, Full Spectrum, NoDa, Foothills, Benford, etc. Not a huge list, but very respectable. Tonight however I was drawn to the cherry infused burbon and coke. Wow, that was fantastic! My wife tried the Apple Cider Margerita. It just ok.  For the food! I got Roasted Salmon with Shrimp Tomato soup and zucchini noodles. It was amazing. Every bite just busting with flavor. My wife got the special of the evening which was lamb ribs, with a potato croquette. Also amazing.  They had a nice selection of deserts, but by this time, we were feeling very satisfied and decided to pass. I will definitely be back to this place, and recommend you check it out as well. One of the most satisfying small town dinning experiences I have had."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what Fort Mill has been missing! Delicious food and great ambiance. My friend and I shared the pork nachos and they were amazing. We cleaned the plate. She had the chicken pot pie and thought it was excellent. I had the salmon and it was slightly overcooked, but still very good.  We shared the blackberry cobbler for dessert. My only suggestion would be for them to carry more varied wines to pair with meals, but otherwise I plan on going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful place. Their spin on a BLT is amazing. Very tasty, well proportioned chicken salad. Creative, fun flavorful sides. All in a warm, friendly atmosphere. Get to Local Dish soon!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the local dish twice now,service is good but  The food is mediocre at best,Farm to Table implies to me fresh and local Meat and produce prepared with a lot of flavor,I got none of this here I ordered spinach salad with the mushrooms and grilled chicken it was swimming in some kind of tasteless sauce my friend had what we thought was a local grass fed burger with fries again the burger tasted like a precooked that you get from Costco and fries were limp greasy and lifeless,overprice for substandard food,Farm to Table is is a good concept expect so many restaurants under this guise does not deliver. Cute restaurant,really need to work on menu and serve fresh,local and seasonal flavorful food.."}
{"text":"My son and his wife recently moved to Ft Mill. We went here for lunch on the Thursday before Christmas. Wow, it was busy at 12n, we sat at the bar.  I had the meat loaf that comes with collard greens, excellent! Ben had the pork belly sandwich.  Friendly staff and Adam at the bar took good care of us."}
{"text":"Nope. With qualifiers.  This was my first, and probably last, visit. First, let me say my dinner companion's shrimp pasta was SUPERB! It was fresh, plentiful, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly. Also, the service from the server was excellent. He was attentive and kind, and genuine.  Now. My own meal was not good. I had the chicken pot pie. The menu says \"Diced chicken and fresh vegetables in Parmesan cream and baked in puff pastry.\" Our server set it down in front of me and warned me that it was very hot. It was not. My first clue was when I broke into the pastry and NO STEAM came out. I scooped out a spoon of the filling and there was no steam there. Finally, I did something I'd normally never do in a restaurant: I poked my finger down in it. Not. Hot. My companion tasted it and said, \"Good. Not hot, but good.\" I signaled the server. He was surprised when I told him, but took it graciously.  Here's where things really went wrong: Another gentleman brought it back and it had obviously been microwaved. The pastry was soggy and fallen. \"It's temped at 165 degrees,\" he said. And left. The server came by a little later and asked how it was. I told him it was fine, but that I was disappointed it had been microwaved. He said he thought they'd put it in the oven. I told him I knew from the condition of the pastry that it had been microwaved.   The other guy came back. He asked what the problem was. I repeated my concern. He said they'd put it in the oven, but that was going to take too long, so they put it in the microwave for a minute so I wouldn't have been kept waiting. \"Ok,\" I said. \"It's not what I would have done.\"  He asked if they should take it off the bill. I told him to forget it.  What should they have done? Made another one. It would have cost them another pastry top. That's it. They could have even reheated the bottom. Another thing they could have done was BEEN MORE GRACIOUS. Mistakes get made. Don't announce the temperature to me...this further proved to me that the first pass was too cool. There was an obvious difference in temp when I tasted it the second time. By announcing the temp to me, he was basically implying \"So there. Shut up.\" And...they could have been decisive about making it right. Instead of asking me if they should take it off the bill, they should have said, \"I'm sorry about that. I'll take that off the bill. How about something else?\" Or better yet, \"How about I make you a new one?\"  I won't be back. I make an amazing pot pie and very good shrimp pasta.  Oh. And there were no vegetables in the chicken pot pie. My companion and I saw a couple pieces of celery. Nothing else."}
