{"text":"Staying in Whiby for a few days went pass the Magpie it was Sunday and there was a queue so we came back Monday dinner time this time walked straight in, we had the small fish and chips, it does say they are Yorkshire portions, they are not wrong, the food was perfect. The fish is bought from the market just across the road. would certainly eat there again"}
{"text":"I'm not a massive fish and chips fan but you've got to have them when you go to the seaside! I'd heard loads about this place (seemed like everyone I'd told I was going to Whitby recommended it) so I thought I'd go see what all the hype was about.  The restaurant does look nice from the outside, but there was a very long queue and we wanted some time to explore Whitby in the afternoon, so we decided to go for the takeaway. The queue for that wasn't too bad - it was about half two so maybe we'd missed the rush, but we had our meals within fifteen minutes. We ate it sitting on the beach and I was so impressed - you could taste the freshness of the fish (as you should be able to in a fishing village) and it was cooked to perfection - not at all greasy, and still really hot. Although it had seemed quite expensive (I think it was about £8 for two portions) the fantastic quality and the size of the portions made it good value - we could have shared one and still been full. I'm sure the food in the restaurant's just as good, but I'd recommend getting a takeaway and eating it on the beach to save time and get the real seaside experience!"}
{"text":"We travel a 4hour round trip every other month to Whitby and treat ourselves to Fish & Chips from \"Maggies\".  Worth every mile and every penny.  We share a portion between two as they portions are very generous.  Not eaten in the restaurant and we only frequent the takeaway underneath the restaurant as we take our dog with us for the journey.  My little place of Heaven in Yorkshire"}
{"text":"This Chippy is meant to be the Best in the Country,  all I can say is that it's good, well presented,  but the queues are huge and to be quite honest  once we got our food it wasn't that special, It is good don't get me wrong, but as others have said,  a lot of Hype. If you really want a good Chippy,  go to Brixham in Devon, Looe in Cornwall,  or Mr Chips in Newark.. If you are in Whitby.. go to the Magpie.. it's still worth a visit.."}
{"text":"Great experience. We arrived on a rainy night, expecting a long line, but perhaps because of the weather only had to wait about 5 minutes to get in. The service was wonderful - the server was very friendly and funny and knew all the items on the menu well (giving very candid recommendations). The Slipway ale was good, and the cod and chips and haddock and chips were indeed excellent. Sticky toffee pudding was very good as well - ask for both custard and ice cream with it :)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Absolute magic on a plate. The best fish and chips ever (not just coming from me, but from 5 others as well who have had way more experience!). Just for funsies we did a cod vs haddock taste test. Personally, I'm a haddock fan, but that's neither here nor there. Making a reservation is key - especially for a larger group. They also give you a nice little victoria sandwich cupcake complete with candle if it's your birthday. Tons of options for any diet or taste. Highly recommended if you are visiting the wonderful town of Whitby!"}
{"text":"Best fish and chips ever? I think so! When people heard we were coming to Whitby for the day they all said 'go to the Magpie Cafe!'. Our plan was to go for a massive walk first, then head there for some well earned noms, but instead we nipped to the takeaway bit as soon as it opened because we'd heard the queues get massive - by the time we'd walked all over Whitby and came past again, there was a queue halfway down the street so we did well : )    Light, crispy batter, tasty chunky chips and fresh fluffy fish - deeelish."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about The Magpie Cafe in Whitby for the last decade.  It is infamous in my family because my cousin lives in Saltburn and whenever a Canadian or American relative comes to visit, they are taken to The Magpie for fish and chips.  This past May it was finally my turn and I was not disappointed.  My husband and I shared the Magpie fish special -- not sure if that's what it's called, but it comes with 4 different typs of fried fish and chips (fries) -- and it was all delicious!  I probably would have just stuck with the haddock if I had to do it all over again, but I was disapointed at all--the fish was perfectly fried and the batter was light and flavorful.  Also, I noticed people were ordering ice cream sundaes for dessert, and although I was pretty stuffed, I ordered one too, and I wasn't disappointed!  So glad I was initiated into the Magpie -- glad there isn't anything like this here in the US because my waist line couldn't take it!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the Magpie Cafe is the most famous fish and chip place in Whitby, but by recommendation from quite a number of friends and colleagues it is the best. Going by my experience I wouldn't argue: it seems entirely possible. The haddock was huge (my companion had cod) and the chips were much more flavourful than any other chippie I have frequented. I wonder what type of potatoes they use? The teacakes were unremarkable but good, but it was the quality of the fish and potatoes that made the experience: unsurprisingly for a fishing port, the fish tastes fresh enough to have just that moment jumped out of the water. Mouthwateringly delicious, even in memory - I'm hungry right now - and not unreasonably expensive at takeaway prices."}
{"text":"Fish and chips are okay, nothing special. Very over priced."}
{"text":"The Magpie is a legendary fish restaurant and always attracts large queues waiting for tables. The menu is quite varied from the normal fish and chips to a selection of fresh fish and some seafood, with veggie choices and some meat options for those who don't like fish. We had to try this and went out of season so got in relatively easily, it's a nice place with plenty of table spread over a couple of floors. We both had the small fish and chips and that was plenty large enough. It was all cooked fresh and brought to the table. While I really enjoyed it, I wasn't keen on the fact that it's cooked in lard, as I'm used to vegetable oil and found the taste took some getting used to. They also do a selection of desserts but we were so full after the main that we reluctantly had to pass! The Magpie opened a takeaway chip shop next door so you can now experience the taste without the long queues, well there can be a queue but it's much quicker to get served than to get in!"}
{"text":"Well over hyped ,they do good fish and chips but at a price and usually a huge queue. I also find that the oil they fry the fish and chips in has a strange aftertaste (only noticed during 2nd visit) There is a much better fish and chip shop in Whutby that all the locals use ,its a bit out of the way but much better value and alot nicer in my honest opinion. Silver street fisheries is the best chippy in Whitby."}
{"text":"Whitby has fish and chips shops everywhere you turn so it can be difficult choosing where you should spend your hard earned cash. Our local foodie contacts on Twitter all said that the Magpie was the best in town so we took their advice and ignored the rest.  On a Monday night in June the restaurant was fairly busy but there were still \"walk in\" tables available. However, we decided to keep it old school and have a \"carry out\" fish supper. We joined the short, friendly queue at the shop next to the main restaurant and we were served within a couple of minutes: haddock for me, cod for B and a portion of chips to share. All cooked to order and served with a smile for under £12.  My haddock was quite possibly the finest piece of fried fish I have had the pleasure of eating. A light crispy batter encased a fish that was fresh, flavoursome and fragrant. B was complementary about her cod as well (being a Yorkshire lass quality fish and chips is no big deal to her) and rated it as top notch.  I'm already looking forward to a return visit to Whitby and another fishy feast at the Magpie Cafe."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough last year (2011) to be able to get a seat at The Magpie three days in a row. The service was excellent, especially as they were run off their feet with three large parties already in situ. The food was excellent and, although there are quite often long queues to get in, it is a small place after all, it is worth it in the end. There are nice views out across the harbour as well, and the Abbey and church on the other side, are well worth a visit if you have time, and the energy to climb the 199 steps as a pedestrian; there is a route by car as well though, so don't worry."}
{"text":"Loved it. But then I enjoyed my whole holiday to Whitby. Myself and my good lady went on a 4 day break to Whitby last September and really enjoyed it. Having family that had been on holiday there helped as they advised us to try The Magpie on the waterfront. To be honest, the first couple of days we were there we walked past each evening laughing at those hungry pedestrians who were queuing up like cattle, or indeed Apple fans waiting for the next iPhone which is made of chocolate, or gold.....or garden fairies carrying good vibes. Basically we knew we would probably try it on our last night there and we were glad we did. I`m not a huge fan of fish and chips as I find them normally fatty and too filling, with the feeling almost like you`ve just gorged on a large fish, perhaps a whale and then someone comes along ringing a bell offering ice cream. However, I enjoyed the meal thoroughly although, initially I was disappointed with the size of the meal. As we both ordered the smaller fish thinking that it was going to be a monster but of course we were wrong. It did leave us wanting more though. What I would say is don`t expect a nice relaxing evening meal where you can swoon over your partner (or yourself if so inclined) as the service is hurried and frantic at times and once you have actually gotten in to be seated (after an hours wait) you are then ordering straight away and not expected to hang about. Obviously this is because they are popular and want to seat as many people as possible but this does spoil the feel of the plaice....(sorry, someone was going to do it if I didn`t!) and makes it feel like a rush. So after waiting for this wonderful meal, the best fish and chips this side of the atlantic, you are then given 20 minutes to get it down you and be on your way. It`s a shame as the food was great and the waiting actually gives it a feeling of anticipation, almost building it up more than it deserves but overall it`s definitely worth the wait and making the effort to go. Not the cheapest, not the most relaxed but the best fish and chips and you can`t fault the speed of service!"}
{"text":"these fish and chips are going to be hard to beat, the fish is perhaps the best tasting ever! the chips are nice as well, could have eaten more. had to queue up for about 20 mins  but worth it !!"}
{"text":"The Magpie must be one of Whitby's most famous restaurants. Located on the main tourist strip of Whitby, alongside the harbour, it is instantly recognisable by the huge queue of people waiting for a table.    Seafood expert Rick Stein has also dined here, and way extreemly impressed - high praise indeed as he is the God in all that is seafood cookery.    Yes, the fish and chips are out of this world! So if you can face the queue then you must go for lunch one day! Fish and chips isn't complete without a slice of bread and butter and a cup of tea - but if you can manage without and want to forgo the queue then try the takeaway restaurant next door."}
{"text":"If I was not vegetarian thn 5 stars but there are veggie options. There are a few great fish and chips shops here..some have won awardsobviously fresh fish comes in with the fleet. The Magpie Cafe in Whitby is one of the most famous restaurants in England. Unlike other famous restaurants however the Magpie does noes deliver haute cuisine, instead it is famous for its fish and chips. Do not be put off at the length of the queues outside. Even if it is pouring down with rain, and it does quite frequently in Whitby, you can still guarantee that that there will be anything up to a hundred people that will have formed a queue outside waiting for the doors to open.    Having quickly won over the locals and regular visitors to the town with its quality fish and chips, the final surge in popularity came when the famous food critic, Rick Stein announced that this place served the best fish and chips in Britain.  People began flocking here from all over the country and indeed from other parts of the World too, and this placed the Magpie, within the market of fish and chips at least, into a league of its own.    In many ways the Magpie has become a victim of its own success and other local traders are now complaining that the daily queues outside are obstructing their shop entrances and their trade is suffering. It is one of the town's most popular tourist attraction and serves as a magnet for visitors.    It opens at 11.30. There will already a very long queue outside. It is like the TARDIS deceptively large inside.  It is painted black and white, the colours of a magpie bird, from where I assume this place derived its name. The location is right on the edge of the harbour. It is not however apparent just how wonderful this location is, until you are inside the building, since the water is not visible from the front of the building. There are also views of St Mary's Church and the Abbey on the hillside above.    The history of this building dates back to 1750 when it was originally a merchant's house. It became the Magpie Cafe in 1939. In between this time a prominent member of the Scoresby whaling family owned it for many years and it was also used a shipping office and a pilot's office. There is a ghost here, called Albert that puts in regular appearances. (From Harrowing's shipping office times).    The menu is very seaside orientated and you will find little else other than fish and seafood.Haddock, Cod and Plaice available. It is also possible to request that the fish be poached or grilled rather than fried and served with or without batter.    The magpie makes no secret in the fact that it uses lard to cook its products in and this is without doubt one of the main contributing factors to the rich taste. It is however possible to request that your food not be fried in lard and the menu does contain a small selection of dishes that would be suitable for vegetarians, but for non fish or seafood eaters this is somewhat limited. Kippers are here.. Lindisfarne Oysters.Seafood ChowderClams, Crevettes, Mussels, Crab,Anchovies, Salmon, Smoked Salmon, Scallop, Mop Herring and Prawns. Every possible kind of fish from 10 inch cod to crab and lobster thermidor. For veggies there is shepards pie, pasta dishes, mushroom stroganoff and dishes of the day plus olive and chiabatta starter.    Locally sourced food is a strong theme here and the majority of the seafood that is served has been caught here in Whitby. The bread is also locally baked. The Magpie Cafe is licensed to sell alcohol and there is quite an extensive wine list.Tea arrives in a large pot that actually contains real tea leaves as opposed to teabags."}
{"text":"We have seen large queues before outside this restaurant and wondered what all the fuss was about standing outside and getting so cold! In Oct our family went to see and it was lovely and warm inside and very full. We were taken upstairs to a nice big table and given plenty of time to choose our food. It is maily a sea food/fish restaurant and our children had traditional fish and chips which were enormous and lovely chips. My husband chose a sea food pot and I a haddock and salmon gratin which was delicious. We mentioned it was his birthday and at the end the waitress got the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday and brought out a bun with a candle in, it was great. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips at the Magpie Café was a perfect end to a long day of sight-seeing. Whitby has plenty of options for fish and chips, but only a few that offer gluten free. There was minimal wait on the Saturday evening when we were there in late November. Everyone ordered Cod and Chips except for the Haddock (haddock is so much more yummy) and Chips I ordered. Mine was in a gluten free batter that was amazingly light, crisp, and perfectly seasoned over very fresh and flakey fish. Apparently, it is that they fry their fish in lard rather than oil that makes for the incredible batter coating. The small size portion was quite sufficient, as I almost was unable to finish and had no room for dessert.  The wait staff were quite friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Can not wait for a return visit to Whitby and Magpie Café."}
{"text":"I went to this cafe as a young boy and kept mentioning it to my wife - saying the fish and chips were the 'best'.    We recently visited this (both of us in our 50's).    First of al the Haddock and chips we had was very good, but the reputation the cafe has far exceeds the quality. Very good, but certainly eaten better in many places.    Anyone travelling near Stirling in Scotland, must visit the Allanwater Cafe in Bridge of Allan - much better than the Magpie and even better than the UK National multi time winner Anstruther Fish Bar."}
{"text":"We had the cod fish & chips and enjoyed every morsel! The batter on the fish was flakey and crispy. I was so sad eating the last bite because I know we will probably never be back in Whitby and when was I going to have fish and chips this good, ever again? I thought about buying the restaurant cookbook but decided I'd never be able to replicate chippies this good. The fish was high quality, fresh and generous. The menu was super extensive with a giant selection of different types of fresh fish prepared in a zillion ways.  We didn't have room for dessert but they looked great too!"}
{"text":"Ein wirklich aussergewöhnliches Restaurant mit für England weit überduchscnittlicher, wenn nicht sogar herausragender Küche. Authentisches Ambiente in einer der schönsten Städte der Welt! Unbedingt lange vorher reservieren, sonst genießt man stundenlanges Schlangestehen! Oft gepriesen als Englands bester Fish & Chip Shop sind es aber Gerichte wie \"Skate Wings, Scallops oder Clam-Chowder, die die Küche benerkenswert machen. Fish & Chips bekommt man anderswo günstiger und oft auch besser (z.B. Trenchers in Whitby). F & C schmecken sowieso am authentischsten, wenn im Take Away gekauft (lange Schlangen sind hier ein sicherer Qualitätsbeweis!), mit Essig beträufelt und in eine Tageszeitung gewickelt (die Druckerschwärze gibt eine unverwechselbare Geschmackskomponente!) ca 15 Minuten zum Durchziehen unter die Achsel geklemmt und dann auf einer Bank im Hafen verspeist!"}
{"text":"Time and time again we return to the Magpie even though we live 100 miles away, and we have yet to be disappointed.    As we like to sit on our own we sometimes have to wait longer in the queue than necessary, but if you lke to share you will be seated faster. Last time we went we only queued for 5 minutes and this was at 3.30 so maybe go later rather than sooner and your wait will not be as long. Situated over four floors this is not great for anyone with a problem with stairs! The tables are close together but not intrusive.  The menu is so comprehensive that for a fish lover, well,it can take a while to make a choice. I personally think that it is great value for money, we have always found the staff to be helpful and friendly, also very patient when I cannot make my mind up! We like to try different things there, if you want a feast try a salad, I would not say that these are slimming though! Loads of different fishy treats, my special contained, lobster,crab,smoked salmon, poached salmon,tuna, mussels, cockles, prawns, langoustines, and other delights I have fogotten, plus a myriad of leaves,tomatoes,spring onions,coleslaw etc etc etc. Also please try the fish pie it is to die for! The mega fish and chips do literally hang off the plate and are more akin to a small whale than a fish. As everything is fried in lard they have that deep rich yet crisp taste ( I am now starting to drool!) Great proper chips light and fluffy but with a crisp outside.    Alcohol is served and is not overpriced, tea, coffee and minerals, bear in mind the Tea is proper tea, leaves not bags. The staff do not rush you out even if they have a queue and you can linger and just enjoy.  When eating here I have always felt that everyone seems very happy and pleasant, (customers and staff alike) Maybe it is the good old fashioned, English with full tums syndrome.    An ecclectic mix of nationalities though, who all seem to say the same thing, Great!  The Magpie also now have a take away so you can enjoy on the move!"}
{"text":"This is the most popular place to eat in whitby, especially fish and chips. Its a black and white building opposite the harbour and if you visit on a weekend you will be stuck in a queue for anything upto an hour waiting for a table.  They have now opened a takeaway next door where the queue will move quicker and the food is just as good, a little more expensive than the average fish and chip shop - but its worth it. Your food will be fresh and is served in a box, if you want fish and chips for dinner go here."}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if you find yourself in had Whitby!   There is always a big queue, this time round I waited for about 30 minutes for a table for 4. The wait is usually less if there are just 2 people but it is worth the wait. There are lots of tables inside but service is still very fast and friendly. The food is so fresh and the choice is amazing. Also, genuinely one of the best cups of tea I have ever had!   A word of warning, there are loads of stairs inside so this could make it difficult if you have a pushchair/wheelchair.   Don't be put off by the queue! There is a takeaway option which is a good choice on a sunny day!"}
{"text":"This is a place that always gets rave reviews and I can't understand why! After waiting for half an hour in a queue down the small street packed with tourists, you get in there and the staff are too busy to smile. Because of its reputation, the prices are hiked up and the tables have been crammed in so it's like a traditional tea room except your bumping knees with your neighbour. The food is nice but not out of this world and I ve tasted far superior fish elsewhere"}
{"text":"You haven't been to Whitby until you've feasted at the Magpie Cafe, its renowned for its freshly caught fish meals, but don't just stick to the fresh cod and haddock, try the Lindisfarne oysters, sheer heaven. We generally pig out here by having lunch and dinner. The service is very friendly, well they are Yorkshire folk after all.  NB: Make sure you book first, it will save you a long wait outside on the steps."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow initially but good food quality and good selection would come back"}
{"text":"In the UK visiting family, my brother took us to Whitby and the Magpie. Everybody in the north of England seems to know this place and for good reason! Family had cod and chips, i had scampi and chips (childhood memories!) and it was all fantastic! The fish was so fresh tasting that my kids' American palates inhaled it. You can never go wrong with scampi anyway. The place itself was really nice - cosy and warm. I understand why everyone knows this place and the next time i'm in Whitby i will definitely go again."}
{"text":"The Magpie Cafe in Whitby - what more is there to say?  The starter (prawns and crab) was delicious, the Haddock and chips gorgeous, crispy batter, moist fish, great chips and I enjoyed - unlike me - even the mushy peas.  There was no room left for a dessert. Small criticism: although I really like strong coffe, I would not recommend that one to people with a heart condition ;-)"}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Absolute magic on a plate. The best fish and chips ever (not just coming from me, but from 5 others as well who have had way more experience!). Just for funsies we did a cod vs haddock taste test. Personally, I'm a haddock fan, but that's neither here nor there. Making a reservation is key - especially for a larger group. They also give you a nice little victoria sandwich cupcake complete with candle if it's your birthday. Tons of options for any diet or taste. Highly recommended if you are visiting the wonderful town of Whitby!"}
{"text":"Whitby is such a lovely town, I was impressed by the fact there was a queue nearly outside every restaurants that served Fish & Chips and the town itself smells Fish & Chips apart for the top part on the hill near Whitby Abbey. Of course the longest queue was where my friend wanted to go: The Magpie Café, but he told me it was the one of the best Fish & Chips in the UK. We waited 40 minutes which wasn't that bad as it was pretty warm and sunny outside. I'm not sure I will have queue that much under the rain.  The menu is mainly fish dishes (fried or grilled) but they also have vegetarian options. However my friend and I are not vegetarian so we both ordered a regular cod and chips each and we shared a side of mushy peas as the waiters told us the regular portion of fish was massive. The waitress didn't lie, the fish was very big, the batter was light, crispy and not greasy, and the fish inside was...WOW... white and flakey. It was by far the best fish and chips I had in my life, nothing compare to all the fish and chips I had in London, Brighton or Eastbourne. Fries and mushy peas were perfect too. Both plates were empty at the end.  While we were eating, one of the table next to us became available, my friend and I were both impressed by the rapidity of the service, in less than 30 seconds three waiters had emptied and re-laid the table for new customers, by reading that you might think they pushed us out very quickly after the meal... but in reality it was totally the opposite, you didn't feel they were in the rush, they let you enjoy your meal and even digest at your table."}
{"text":"The Magpie is known world wide for it's food and there is a constant queue of people waiting to go in for a meal. However they have now opened a little take away just next to the steps with a smaller faster moving queue. Although i've been to Whitby many many times i've never visited the magpie because of the queues so seeing the new take away we just had to try them out.....easily the best fish and chips i've had for a long time. The fish was huge!"}
{"text":"As Americans living in London on a roadtrip around England, we had to stop in Whitby and try the Magpie Cafe. All I can say is WOW. I've never seen more generous portions, more perfectly prepared fish-n-chips, and the absolute satisfaction of rolling out of there feeling like you should be put in hospital. I couldn't eat here every week, but I'm glad we tried it. Would heartily recommend!"}
{"text":"This place scores high on everyones books and it would have scored a 5 star review in mine if it wasnt just for one thing. We ordered an order of fish and chips(of course) and naturally it was very very tasty we also ordered some fish cakes again nowt wrong with em and at 4 quid for the flavour packed into those bad boys it was worth it. Now to the bad we order the paella and it was tasty the fish cooked very well the rice was nice hell they even threw in squid which was a very tasty accompliment but the mussels still had barnicles on them and it was just a turn off. I might be being picky but when paying almost 20 pounds for a dish I dont want to look at green sickly looking things on my mussels. This was the only complaint and they took care of it promptly so the service was good it was just the mussels that let it down. The staff were lovely and everything else was spot on and I really wish I could give a 4.5 star review cause thats what it really deserves so get the fish and chips enjoy them and just relish on how fresh they taste."}
{"text":"The absolute best in fish and chips, and my first mushy peas experience. I became hooked and now beg and hope for them at Shakespeare's in San Diego. Can't wait to come back to lovely Whitby."}
{"text":"I have been to seafood restaurants many times before, but never have I had a meal quite as nice as the Magpie Café. The fish was perfect and so fresh you'd swear it had been caught then immediately thrown in the pan, the seasoning top-notch, and the drinks selection superb. Waiters and waitresses all polite and good, reasonably timed service.   There is nothing I could fault about the restaurant. The queue is understandable when you consider the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"We went there twice, one for fish&schools another for the hot seafood pot. Both dishes are great but I have to recommend hot seafood pot to you. If you like seafood, you have to try this.;)"}
