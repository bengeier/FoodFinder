{"text":"This place was really quite spectacular on many levels.    This restaurant is the most attractive Chinese restaurant around.  It is to the right of  Rao's in Caesar's Palace.  I love going up the elevator and then walking into the dining room. Nice high pitched ceilings, modern furniture in a cool ivory arranged in a circular fashion.  It was very special and unique.  The service was really good. The servers were attentive. They poured my tea, continually stopped by with water (have you tried getting water at a Chinese restaurant???), and it was overall such a wonderful and lovely experience.  Low key, elegant, and calm. The perfect antidote to the craziness beyond its walls.  My only gripe would be the hostess that met us upstairs.  I like nice people who are polite and she was haughty and that is a very unattractive quality. Yet the hostess on the main floor of the casino was very sweet and pleasant...that's one reason why we felt we were willing to try it going into the elevator to be hoisted upstairs.  Our server was Vicky and she knew absolutely everything about the food.  She was so terrific and just REAL! Her favorite is the General Tso's Chicken so we got that dish. My husband and friend liked it...I don't eat chicken so will not comment on it personally.    We also ordered the Sea Bass and Tofu Hot Pot.  OMG -- this was EXCELLENT. The sea bass was completely succulent and the tofu was just right...soft and soaked up the sauce.  This was my favorite dish.   The third dish we ordered was Buddha's Delight.  There was an ingredient I enjoyed however did now know what it was..Vicky told us it was gingko.  Great!  Now I know I love gingko.  I ordered a special dessert...I do not remember the name of it - although Vicky wrote it for me in Chinese...however I will describe it as being made with barley and is a sweet slightly syrupy soup...it was quite good except...it looked to be a huge portion but was not...more soupy than substantive - however I still liked it - quite a bit. And maybe it is suppose to be soupy? Vicky described it as a healthy dessert...if you know Chinese medicine...this had some medicinal herbs in it.  The tea is not on the house like at other Chinese restaurants yet it was only $3...what a DEAL!  I ordered the chrysanthemum tea and it came with rock sugar on the side. JUST delicious.  Before the teapot was half empty, Vicky had brought out a fresh pot for me.  THANK YOU Vicky...that is really attentive service!  I would come back again and feel totally confident suggesting it to my friends.  I hope that you, dear reader, will go to this restaurant and enjoy the ambiance of the gorgeous and softly lit low key dining room."}
{"text":"Empress Court offers very fresh ingredients that come out piping hot.  The meat doesn't taste synthetic or overly salty like other Chinese places.  I thought the prices were a little higher than usual on some menu items.  They also forgot an order of rice with one of the entrees but it is not really that big of a deal."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo good. I even came for my homecoming once many years ago. I've never had anything bad.  The service is always wonderful and my favorite dishes are the shrimp chow ho fun and their hot and sour soup is delicious (and vegetarian!). Obsessed."}
{"text":"The food at Empress Court is always good. They may be a little understaffed at times and you will have to wait a long time....But in the end the price and quality make up for the wait."}
{"text":"Best pork fried rice hands down! Very fast.  Very nice staff. Great prices.  I took my grandma there and she loved it she said she would DEFINITELY come again."}
{"text":"This Place is kinda hidden and you have to ride the creepy elevator up... O_O.... but the food is alright.. it is kinda more expensive than chinese food should be but its not bad. Simple soup costs 8$ ^. The pork fried rice was good! Came to this place twice!.. Not bad.... The restaurant looks kinda modern/newish. Not many people come up here... But you should give it a shot."}
{"text":"This was hands-down the single worst dining experience I have had in years.  And the problems ran from making reservations (I was transferred 3 times, even though I called the # on the website) to service to the awful food. We went for restaurant week and had to request the menu as it wasn't offered.  Once we placed our dinner order, my cocktail arrived promptly, but it took over 30 minutes to get our first course!  There were only two of us and it did not appear to be busy.   I had the chicken corn chowder and only took a few bites.  The chicken broth had been thickened with cornstarch so it had that weird viscous texture, then there was no flavor.  It needed to be seasoned and there was only a bit of corn and what looked like maybe egg drop.   My second course was fish with filet mignon, mushrooms and fried rice.  The fish was very strange. It looked as though it had been pan-fried, there was no real batter, just perhaps a light dusting of flour or such, but the fish itself, not the coating, was absolutely greasy and all I tasted was oil.  This is strange, because it was sea bass and not an oily fish.  In fact I am not even sure how they cooked it to get it that oily.  And I found a bone in my first bite. The mushrooms were quite rubbery, the sauce tasted like brown water and the fried rice was greasy and flavorless.  The filet mignon was very tender, but in a strange canned-beef sort of way.   Neither of us ate hardly any of this course.  In fact there was quite a bit of food left on the plates.  When the server came he asked if we weren't hungry.  I said no, I didn't like it.  He mumbled something and walked away. Our dessert was mango pudding and mochi.  A mixture of hard, underripe mango and a very delicious mochi (it looked like the brand I buy at Trader Joe's, ha!). After each course, we would push our plates out of the way, staff would walk by and look, but keep on walking.  I had to ask for my check. I would normally have higher standards for fine dining restaurants that charge more for their food, but even compared to my neighborhood Chinese take-out, this is far worse.  I am really just dumbfounded at how truly awful the food was through and through."}
{"text":"Outdated decor... slow and unfriendly service... paid $130 for 2 people (no cocktails) for Chinese food that was equivalent to a average Chinese buffet. Save yourself the money and frustration and eat at Beijing No. 9"}
{"text":"I have been coming here every Monday for the last 6 months to enjoy the hot and sour soup. It is phenomenal, perhaps the finest in the Cleveland area. The staff is also incredibly helpful especially when you are torn between 2 of the many incredible dishes offered. The post modern decor is also comforting. It really feels like you are eating with the Emperor when you come to the court!"}
{"text":"The communication gap is unacceptable.  I request \"very spicy\" and ask for a handful of chili peppers for added heat and get bland and no chili peppers.  Years ago was very responsive to customer requests, now not so much."}
{"text":"This place is 100% awful. Bad service, substandard food...  a lot to pay for lame Chinese if you're not getting it comped. Do NOT come here."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot for Chinese in the Aurora/Chagrin Falls area. I've known the owner for years and their service and food is always up to par. I can't recall one bad experience.  I recommend the hot and sour soup and the general Tso's chicken. Sauce is real tasty and you can get it as hot as you want. Pot stickers are also very good. If your looking for a killer spot for Chinese definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in the area. You can always count on them for easy, delicious take out. If you choose to dine inside the atmosphere is quaint and seemingly authentic and never too busy. Service is always prompt and very efficient.  The egg rolls and wonton soup are both always crowd pleasers and their menu is extensive, so you'll surely find something to satisfy all member of your family or group of friends!"}
{"text":"Menu online is very old, I will include an updated menu below. Other than that the food is your standard issue Chinese takeout, nothing gourmet but not straight from the garbage can. Would recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"My wife visited here for the first time. The service was excellent. We never had to refill our own hot tea, nor did any plate sit finished on our table.  The decor and aquarium inside add to the comfortable atmosphere.   I ordered the wok fried scallops and loved it. The XO sauce was yummy.  We will be back for more, no question."}
{"text":"I really liked the won ton soup and the lemon chicken.  The place is beautiful and I felt a bit under dressed but hey I was in a 10 hour class (training) so I have an excuse hehe.  The waiters were very nice."}
{"text":"Step 1: Gamble Step 2: Get Casino to Comp Step 3: Empress Court Step 4: =)  Very delicious. Pricey. But you can get what you want here in terms of Chinese.   400$ Fish fresh from the sea? No Problem."}
{"text":"I attended a large group dinner here in May...kind of a strange selection since some people don't care for Asian food.  I must have ordered wrong because some other guests enjoyed their meal more than I did.  The sea bass was fishy smelling...which completely turned me off from the dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is usually very good. I've been frequenting this restaurant for 12 years. They make some of the best spare ribs I've ever eaten. The Sprimp in Lobster Sauce is excellent as are most of their dishes. The Wonton Soup is disappointing. Just plain wontons, not a pork dumpling, a few shreds of roasted pork, and very few greens if any. The hot and sour is pretty good, but could be a little heartier. Their fried rice is very flavorful, some of the best I've ever eaten.. Why only three stars? The owner! Over the years, as one would expect there have been errors in the take-out. The owner will argue with you and never take responsibility or try to compensate you for the mistake. This is certainly not a good business practice. I worked in the food service industry for many years and at  every establishment, it was the policy of the owners to make a situation right by either re-making the order or compensating the customer in some way for the error or dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"A well kept secret in Caesar's Palace =)  My parents brought me to Empress Court for dinner with my boyfriend and it was an AMAZING meal. Yes it's pricey but the food is really good and the service is impeccable. AND you get to take the secret elevator up to the actual dining area where it's quiet, peaceful and relaxing.   When you get up to the main floor there is a really pretty fish tank in front of you and the restrooms are to the left. A hostess will lead you to your seat underneath a beautiful ceiling with twinkling lights. They also have beautiful art on the walls and the tables and chairs they use are very classy. The waiters/waitresses are always on top of their game; when we were there we never had to ask them for anything, they filled our waters, tea, wine, without us asking and did everything on point.  I had a hot and sour soup to start which was quite delicious. This is one of my favorite soups and I'm glad I ordered it as a starter. For our meal we all shared the lobster, mapo tofu, kung pao chicken and fried rice with pork and shrimp. I really liked the tofu since it was in a semi-spicy sauce and the tofu was really soft and luscious. The kung pao was very good as well, and I really liked how they didn't overload the dish with peanuts and instead let every ingredient play its part. The lobster dish was an entire lobster in sauce, even the head!! The fried rice wasn't really anything special, so I'd pass on this next time.   Of course we couldn't resist dessert so we had the key lime pie and the chocolate mousse with raspberry. They were both DIVINE. I was surprised because they weren't Asian desserts but they were perfect!! The key lime had a very potent but yummy citrus flavor and the chocolate mousse was fluffy and delectable. They even put little crunchies inside to give the mousse some texture, something I've never had before!  The only down side to Empress is the price but I think it's well worth it. Definitely check it out if you are looking to splurge on some nom food and want to do so in a quiet, beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Basic Chinese place. Carry out is as expected. Food is okay. They are always friendly and very fast with carry out, but the food is just average."}
{"text":"Great General Tsao's chicken.  I eat here at least once every couple of months.  Workers are very nice though at times service can be a little slow.  I probably have had everything on the menu and it's all very good. If you order something extra spicier , make sure you let them know what level heat you want it a at!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out & when we arrived to pick it up, they had lost the order. No food waiting, no sympathy, & a cold apology. They didn't offer us anything for our inconvenience. Based on the quality of service I will never go back. It is aggravating when you want to give a restaurant hard earned money for their services & they treat you like dirt."}
{"text":"The Empress Court was very quick with their service. I placed an order for take-out and they were very prompt in having the large order completed on time! The food tasted fantastic! I will definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Empress Court has always been a part of my life (literally) and I have to stop every time I'm visiting my home town. It's an older restaurant, but it's the best Chinese food you'll find in the Chagrin Falls area by far, and it is fairly priced! I always enjoy eating at the restaurant rather than getting takeout because each table gets endless green tea for free! It's my absolute favorite tea. I also love the won ton soup which is included with their combination plates and lunch specials.  Some of my favorite entrees are the shrimp cashew, kung pao chicken, and the sweet and sour chicken, but I have never had anything there I didn't like.  If you're new to the area, you need to check out Empress Court, and then head over to Dairy Island next door to have some ice cream after dinner!"}
{"text":"It's your basic. The food is what's be expected of American-style Chinese food: saucy, salty, and flavorful but unoriginal.  Empress court serves crispy vegetables with watercress and sticky rice-based dishes best.  My meal was neither over nor underwhelming, but rather just as predicted.  If one is looking for standard Chinese food, Empress Court delivers, but do not expect anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout with General Tso's Chicken and won ton soup. The food was ready quickly and was of appropriate temperature when I picked it up. The portions were large and both dishes were really good. The chicken pieces were large, moist, and not overly fried. The general Tso's sauce was really good too."}
{"text":"I'm surprised no one else has reviewed this place, ok fine, I'm not shocked at all considering how freakin' intimidating this place is with their prices! It's pretty well hidden and you have to go through an elevator before you actually reach the restaurant. I highly recommend it though if you won some good ol' cold hard cash or you have some caesar's palace rewards points or something that will cover your dining experience here. I absolutely LOVE their duck wraps as heart stopping as they may be...keep them coming! Live shrimp with soy sauce and fresh chili peppers? YUM! and it's not on the menu but they have asparagus with garlic which completes the meal perfectly. It's no ordinary asparagus I guarantee you.   CAUTION: stay away from the bird's nest soup. $100 dollars? You have to be kidding me! Stick with the fried banana."}
{"text":"Wife and I came back here because of a previously great experience here.  We were not disappionted. This place is a hidden gem.   You enter from a prívate elevator and enter into a beautiful dining area.   Perfect place for a romantic dinner. Clean, elegant, great wait staff and reasonable priced.  Don't miss out on this hidden gem when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Over-priced Chinese foods.  Service not up to par for an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"I love any kind of Asian food, but this just wasn't good.  Service extremely slow.  Wonton soup $8.00 and tasteless.  They gave us salt and pepper?  We had to ask for soy sauce?  Noodle dish expensive and didn't seem fresh.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  Much better and less pricey alternatives in Vegas."}
{"text":"The waiting for carry-out is getting worse. One hour for 3 star food. Overall this is below average food, but it's one of the few choices you have for Chinese food in Chagrin Falls, OH."}
{"text":"Props to this place for serving a party of 10 last minute for Thanksgiving dinner last night. The service was great and the place itself is fancy. The ceiling is this beautiful outer space dome but the sound echoes so badly that you feel like a schizophrenic hearing voices in your head!  They serve great Sonoma wine. The prices are high but the food is high quality. My faves include the fish belly soup, the Peking duck (cut and assembled for you at the table), and the peppered beef!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out for dinner one evening after long hours at work. We wanted basic chinese and that is what we got. However, we were disappointed on the spice level. We asked for medium-high spice and there was none what so ever. Other than that, it is well priced and tastes alright. It's your basic chinese food so don't expect too much but it was good service, except a long weight for takeout. We will be back and hoping to try some additional dishes with some more flavor."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and service. Solid offering of specials. The fried rice and shrimp chips are a great start to any meal. The pepper dyes is among our favorites."}
{"text":"Slow service.  But being this slow, it's really just amazing.  It's not like they were super busy or anything.  30 mins after ordering the appetizer,  it made its way to the table.   This is our third time here, bur this place has gone down the hill even my easily satisfied hubby said so.  I guess this would be our last visit.  Here is my take on their food:   Spring rolls, no flavor at all!  Sweet and sour pork, too sweet!!!!, no good!  Mongolian beef was just ok, not good enough for the price.  Chicken with salty fish pot, too much chicken, barely any salty fish, lol.  I forgot what the other dish we ordered, must check the pics to verify.  If I can't remember what we ordered, it must not be memorable.    The ambiance was good, the seating was very comfortable which made up for the food.  If there weren't waiters walking around, I could fancy I was in a Buddhist temple.  I don't want to knock this place too much, but I don't think we got our money worth."}
{"text":"8/10 would recommend. The food is great but the waiter shushed me? The combo meals are a good idea. My favorite part is the free tea, it is so good."}
{"text":"The portions are small and the food is pretty average overall.  This place seems to try too hard to be something they are not.  You could get better food at PF Changs and for a better price."}
{"text":"The food is disgusting and the service is the same. There was something floating in my glass of wine. The shrimp in my entree had a foul smell. I didn't eat it because I was afraid of contracting food poisoning. In addition, the bathrooms are filthy. Hunan by the Falls blows this place away! Do NOT eat here!"}
{"text":"This is the hidden germ of Vegas. I don't know why it has received 3 stars. I first experienced the food here a little more than a decade ago and it was amazing!  I came back recently and the high quality of food/service is unchanged.  Lettuce wraps and duck wraps/Peking duck is just great!  Warning: if u like a big ass food portion then u shouldn't come here.  If you prefer delicacy over regularity, then this is the place for u."}
{"text":"A good 2nd choice if Hunan by the Falls is busy. They do have excellent wonton soup (if that's your thing). Service has always been solid like most Chinese restaurants. I highly recommend a chicken dish. Skip the Mongolian Beef here."}
{"text":"Taste: 4 Creativity/Authenticity: 3.5 Atmosphere: 4 Service: 4 Bang for your buck: 2  Went here with some buddies for my bday and a another; man its been while since ive had good chinese food; yeah we didnt get all the traditional food, but the steamed prawns and sea bass were amazing! the chicken was also cooked to perfection, crispy skin flavorful meat. Next the tofu and steamed vegetables were good, just a good complete meal nothing over powering the other, overall this place is great very classy and just a good meal!"}
{"text":"3.75 stars  If upscale Chinese food is what you want. Empress court will fulfill your want, but your needs, that may take a little more.  The elevator and hostess on the bottom floor gives you a feeling of secrecy and exclusivity. the inside the restaurant is quite small.   The walnut shrimp was excellent, huge succulent shrimp. The peking duck is lackluster, I prefer the traditional bao, but E.C. serves their peking duck in a wheat wrap. They even add red bell peppers, not what I'm used to. The bell pepper throws off the taste and distracts from the duck. The lettuce wraps were plentiful and sufficient. The show stopper was the scallop fried rice, dry shreds of scallops, egg whites and rice was a perfect combination. The crab sauteed in ginger was unimpressible, and not a dish I would order again. The mango pudding was refreshing and had nice chunks of real mango in it.   The service was very good, attentive if you know the server. We had a familar favorite."}
{"text":"This was an experience in itself! Had wonderful service! Had dumplings for apps, then the Shark Fin soup! WOW! What an experience that was. The waiter showed us the best way to eat it and it was a great experience. And then.....it came. We had what can only be called THE Asian experience. We ordered the geoduck (pronounced gooey duck). This was something! A clam that lives for centuries and burrows in the ocean floor. We ordered it XO, which was with a sauce uncluding snow peas. The texture was something like calamari, but not as chewy. It was thinly sliced and well prepared. So good! If there was a flaw, I would say the drinks were a bit sedate. I had an Emperor Sun, it was good and fresh, but no real pop. Overall, what an experience!"}
