{"text":"I've been to Nush three times now and thoroughly enjoyed each experience. The food is light and healthy and delicious to boot. The iced tea is among the best I've had and the patio is really private, lush and generally shaded. Best of all, the owners are actively involved in creating a great time for every patron. 

I had a catered event there and they made it a special night, from allowing us to park our bikes in a secure area to providing ample food for the group, decorating the area for our party to offering drink specials for our guests. And no matter what, try the fries...not the healthiest thing on the menu but worth the calories."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot, my new hang out! It's so chill and very nice I love the decor and the food is amazing!!!! I eat out everyday and this will be one of my once a week places (at least once a week, or more) the owners are husband and wife and are so friendly! I hope they do amazing, they deserve it. (I don't know then but they made us feel like friends) Hard work and effort has gone into this restaurant!"}
{"text":"came here for last day of classes celebration with classmates!! amazing food, great service and amazing price!! food is healthy and full of flavor, this is exactly what ASU needed!! no problem splitting the bill which is a plus... definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"Such great a atmosphere! Fun and funky decor with a delightful patio (it didn't hurt that the weather was perfect today). Started with the spinach and garbanzo beans - whether you are a vegetarian or not - you will love this dish. Nush fries are tasty as well. Went with friends and sampled a number of entrees but the kabobs really stood out. The chicken was so tender and the rice was amazing. The zucchini linguine was delicious, I loved the sausage in it and I'm not a sausage fan. Lots of vegetarian, vegan, gluten free options. A real crowd pleaser. I would drive half an hour just for the cactus flower iced tea! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to Nush for dinner a few nights ago and was surprised by the food quality and flavor. Normally I am not a huge fan of Mediterranean because it can so often be bland at typical restaurants for a vegetarian but Nush has a lot to offer! 

I had the quinoa wrap which had a beautifully blended vegetable quinoa and sauce mix. There were multiple complimentary flavors going on and overall it was very fresh tasting. There are surprisingly more vegetarian options here but they do have a chicken and beef dish if you prefer it. Give it a try when in the asu area!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Healthy food. Terrific ambiance. We're definitely coming back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to Nush the first week they opened. The place is beautiful, great patio, and the food is outstanding. Finally something different in Tempe. Very convenient parking located right under the restaurant, great service. Good luck to this new gem, long life to Nush. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, you enter a restaurant and are immediately enamored by it. This was one of those for me. 
The food: absolutely amazing. Delicious, perfect combinations of spices, large portions for leftovers, healthy!
The prices: PHENOMENAL. Especially for the amount and quality of food you get. 
The service: efficient and kind. Our server Jeremy was so sweet and personable. 
The atmosphere: beautiful and pleasant. Perfect for everyone! They have a bar area with TVs, outdoor balcony seating, comfy lounge-y couches perfect for studying and a snack, tables with tall chairs, and some regular restaurant tables with very comfortable chairs. 

I truly LOVED this restaurant so much. If only we had one on Tucson! I would go every week!

COLLEGE STUDENTS! This place is awesome! Super delicious, yet healthy food. Big portions. Cheap prices. And a super pleasant atmosphere that's perfect for everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is DELICIOUS!! It's healthy and I love that each menu item indicates if it's gluten free, vegetarian etc. My kids even loved it-especially the chicken and the fries. They put a lot of attention to detail into their menu from the saffron they choose and the salt they use. The pomegranate garnish is a nice touch.  The setting is beautiful. One of the top 2 patios in Tempe. Extra bonus is that the owners are very sweet."}
{"text":"Great place! Although it wasn't very busy (a Monday night when I went) the atmosphere is relaxed and had a very chill vibe. The food was great and fairly priced. I had the coconut curry and my boyfriend had the quinoa wrap, we also split the nush fries (fresh potato fries with good Mediterranean spices and yogurt mint dip). Everything we ate was pretty yummy. There were a ton of vegetarian options, too. We took advantage of the 2 for 1 happy hour on draft beer and wine. However, we assumed it meant we could each get a beer and pay for one- nope, it's per person, so we each got 2 beers for the price of 1 each. Still a good deal, but would've liked to know that before we got the check and had to ask (after, we each got our second free beer). Besides that, everything was great!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Nush for the first time and can't recommend it highly enough. The food was great, especially the cutlet appetizer and the linguine zucchini. Tried my wife's spinach sausage linguine too, and it was delish!  Very nice atmosphere, great service and tasty, healthy food. I'll definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"The food, ambiance and staff deserve five stars here! I am huge fan of Mediterranean food. I absolutely love this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to order the beef cutlets with herbs but they were out. I had a very picky palette that night and didn't want anything with potatoes. I ended up getting what the waiter recommended, which was the red chicken wrap, and was disappointed. It was very big but had too much flavor and saltiness. We took it home to maybe eat the next day and it had changed from its original red color to yellow. There was a lot of oil in it. The zucchini pasta dish was delis hand the chicken kabob was simple but flavorful. The deep fried Parmesan chicken was good but you had to order the yogurt mint sauce for extra. This place had a nice garden ambience in the middle of downtown Tempe. A live band was there the night we came which was fun, but if they wanted a more middle eastern vibe, I would suggest a genre of music besides country and rock hits."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to grab a beer during a class break, great place! Happened to have a 2 for 1 on all beers, wines, and cocktails! Awesomely chill ambiance with melody type background music! Definitely a cool spot to kick back and chill. Food prices were fair and a solid selection of beer! Friendly serice."}
{"text":"Awesome service, ambience, great vibe, amazing food choices. Eco friendly, dog friendly  Winner!!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here!  Very laid back with cool, inspired art on the walls, but minimal fuss.  I had a couple of apps...fries and spinach,..and some local (amazing) brews.  Will be back in my next visit to AZ!"}
{"text":"Food was good def different but refreshing!  They just opened last Tuesday and for that I'm impressed. They have beers on tap and a patio deal for wine/beer/apps BOGO! Great deal! I had the sausage spinach linguine, which was very good and my husband had the skewers which were cooked to perfection!!! Chicken and beef which were Sooo good and they had a smoked flavor to them. We will come back"}
{"text":"Food was really fresh and light, but still amazingly filling. There have been too many times where I've left a healthy establishment still hungry. I'm also a vegetarian and they had many items, in their quaint menu, to accommodate me. Although the food was good, the service was even better. Jeremy was the type of guy that I would genuinely like to be friends with. He was helpful, accommodating, and friendly. Bomb ass service. Also. The Huss IPA was stupid delicious."}
{"text":"Placed an order online because it said it was open, when I got there the place is closed I tried calling before hand as well."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and a nice outdoor patio.

Had the Yogurt Mint Dip with Naan and the Skewer Trio (chose beef, chicken, and veg). All the food was great tasting.They have a wide flavored ice tea selection. The cactus flower tea was yummy! Definitely planning on coming again.

This would be a convenient lunch destination for people working at the Fulton Center or in the businesses on Mill. They offer free wifi, and the owner is fine with people hanging around to do homework."}
{"text":"I've been to Nush several times now and this is a hidden gem that I hope sticks around for a while. My first experience was on a Saturday night before they had even had their grand opening. It was later at night and very quiet, but I'd seen on Yelp that they were (incorrectly listed) open until 10pm. It had happened that the other couple in the restaurant was the owner and his wife, two very awesome people. They ushered my friend and I in, assuring us that it was no trouble and we could still be served. I'm glad we did because they had some of the best appetizers I've ever had.

The green bean appetizer is my favorite, but none of the others are too far behind. I would also definitely recommend the Tabouleh which is served with blue corn tortilla chips as a kind of Mediterranean salsa. Yum!

I will definitely be back many more times, and would recommend this (and have)  to friends of mine.

P.S. I made a yelp account specifically to rave about how good this place was. :)"}
{"text":"Had the Nush fries and chicken  protein bowl both were very tasty and the pomegranate  green tea is to die for! Staff was super friendly  the owners even cane out to ask how the food was!"}
{"text":"Yummy food, interesting location AND parking in Tempe?  Sold!  Cooler temps will make the outdoor patio all that more appealing and there's ample parking in the garage just next to the restaurant.  Their hummus is weird (like you-might-not-want-to-order-it weird) but do it anyway.  You won't regret it.  Service was great - would definitely return!"}
{"text":"FABULOUS!!! Just had a great lunch at this adorable place. Wonderful experience from being greeted immediately by the owner, Nona,  with a big welcoming smile to the amazing food!!  We had the hummus, green beans and eggplant delight. All fresh and delicious!!! We will certainly be back and would highly recommend for veggie fans and meat eaters alike!!  It will be great when the weather is nicer to sit out on the charming patio!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time the other night with my brother and absolutely loved this place!!! Their food was healthy and delicious, and their service was great!! The owners are amazing as well!!! I will definitely be back. Overall experience was wonderful!!!!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. Nice indoor outdoor space. Fresh ingredients. The nush fries were super yum."}
{"text":"I love the menu ! Everything taste good.this is my first time seeing a restaurant can have  the traditional Persian food in western style. Absolutely amazing! You should check out this place at least once and you will love it."}
{"text":"Really yummy food.  And so refreshing that everything was served on China and glass with no plastic. 

Really lovely service too and well priced."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Nush, given its high reviews. I have to say that, while I wasn't totally displeased, I didn't think it quite lived up to the hype. Everything I had (Nush fries, spinach and garbanzo, eggplant delight) was good, but not great. Of all my selections, my favorites were the appetizers. The fries get four stars. The yogurt dip is pretty yum. The spinach and garbanzo get three for being average. But my eggplant delight gets two. It was a little sloppy...too much wrap, not enough seasoning in the veggies...it just tasted incomplete. I was glad to get some local beer and really friendly service from my fellow Alabamian waitress. I appreciate Nush's selection of vegan and vegetarian dishes. I would just like to see them step it up a little in the flavor department."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town and looking for a healthy local joint to eat. Saw the good ratings and menu on Yelp and decided to check it out. I was highly satisfied by not only the food but also the atmosphere and service. Definitely look forward to eating here again next time I'm in PHX."}
{"text":"Super cool place. Felt like we just traveled to Europe to have dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I rarely give 5 stars but I can't be the one the first one to give them only four lol . They totally deserve it . From the staff and the atmosphere there it's wonderful . The food was very refreshing . Started off with the nush fries as a appetizer. So good :) I then ordered the protein bowl . Very good 2 . Ended my meal with the pomegranate yogurt . Speechless . I will be returning to this place soon . I mean very soon"}
{"text":"I am a converted lush for Nush.  My friend and I got there right at 3 PM, just in the nick of time for HH to begin.  Let's just say, we had the place all to ourselves.  The 9-5ers were still stuck at work on a Friday!  We got released from ours early enough to get ahead of the crowd.  We didn't get anything heavy, just appetizers.  We thoroughly enjoyed the Nush fries and the green beans.  But mainly we were there for the two for one drinks.  And we finished our time there with Cheesecake.  The most perfect way to end a hectic week."}
{"text":"What a great find! Picked this spot based on the reviews and yummy photos we saw online with plans to head to Tempe for the evening. Very cozy, intimate patio and the inside of the restaurant looks amazing, too. Lots a greenery, vines, twinkle lights and colorful artwork inside. A variety of options to choose from on the menu (vegan and non), and everything is very reasonably priced (especially for organic meats, a big plus). We ordered the hummus plate, roasted eggplant and veggie sandwich and chicken wrap, all which was amazing. Lots of colorful, fresh veggies and the portions were very hearty. The hummus was outstanding and great to have as a side with the entrees as well. Service was very friendly and prompt and drinks were two for one (including wine), which you basically never see on a Saturday night after 7 p.m. Our entire bill for drinks, entrees and an appetizer came to like $35. For the quality of the food, service and atmosphere, I would have easily expected $50 and would have gladly paid it. Will definitely return when we are back in the area and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"It is a vey cozy and nice place to have an appetizer and drink. Price are reasonable and The food is very delicious;)  It is one of my favorite restaurant to eat"}
{"text":"Had the quinoa veggie wrap. Fresh, crisp veggies, came with side of chips and yogurt dip. Nice variety of iced teas they brew. Got tea for free by checking in, so lunch was ~$12 including 20% tip. Would go back for lunch with more people."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened to be walking by Nush last night and decided to stop in for a glass of wine. They had this amazing two glasses for the price of one deal, so we stayed. Duh. Their menu looked really fresh and so we ate some appetizers as well. The food is sooo delicious! The mint yogurt dip is to die for. I want to bathe in it. The atmosphere is fantastically relaxed with some really cool art on their walls, their wine selection is on point, and that mint yogurt dip. Seriously. That dip. Get over there and check it out. And please, for the love of all that is right in this world, order that dip...oh, and a glass of the Niner. It pairs quite lovely with The Dip. Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Cool ambience. There is a waiter/host there with a beard and brown hair, always super friendly! The eggplant delight is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. It has grilled vegetables (inc. eggplant) all drenched in a delicious marinara sauce and it comes on ciabatta bread. The first time I had it, it came with a side of their organic hummus (which is one of the best hummus' I've ever had) which made the sandwich perfect when you spread it on the ciabatta. The first time I had it, it was also on a longer piece of ciabatta bread so that you could share with one other person. I recently got the sandwich, however, and it downsized to a square ciabatta bread, good enough for one person, and it didn't come with hummus anymore. Good for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Food was definitely mediocre (I ordered the sausage linguini) and not many options for lunch. On top of that, service was sub par and our server split the bill without even asking how we'd like it split. My friend ordered a drink, an app, and an entree and I only ordered the linguini but nope, she just went ahead and swiped it for half. Weird for a server not to even ask how you'd like it split. So I explained she got it wrong and rudely said \"Um I can fix it\" and stormed off and now I have three pending charges from a place with mediocre food and mediocre service! Not worth it."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Matchbox 20 - Push)

Well I don't know if it's ever been good enough
I'm a little bit hungry, and I think my belly's caving in
And I don't know if I've ever given Vegan love
By a hand that's fed me, well I feel like Bo Bites gonna give
And I'm a little bit hungry, well

This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need to Yelp around
You don't owe me, we might change
Yeah we just might feel good

I wanna Nush you around, well I will, well I will
I wanna Nush you down, well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for cocktails, I wanna take you for hummus
Well I will


Nush is a cool little hip and borderline psychedelic joint.

I came here cause couple of my friends were vegetarians and I needed a place for them to eat.  They seem to have a great happy hour; 2 for 1 on draft beers and house wine.  For my entree I ordered their Protein Bowl with beef and my partner went for the Roasted Vegetable Salad with chicken.  My vegetarian friends ordered side of fries, hummus and some greenbeans.  My bowl came with basmati rice, red quinoa, garbanzo and mixed bell peppers.  

Needless to say I thought it was pretty basic and plain.  At this point I'm feeling sorry for vegetarians.  Though my friends hummus and fries looked good so I had to have a bite.  The hummus definitely had to be the star of the table.  Smooth, creamy, and sweet because of the caramelized walnuts.  I could have ordered that and call it good for the night.  The fries were fresh cut and served with a yogurt mint dip.  I enjoy fresh cut fries, but prefer them crispy in general.  The green beans were sauteed well and served with a curry-like orange zest.  I love green beans and these were definitely done well; however didn't care for the sauce.

In the end, Nush is a cool place to hang for drinks.  I'm glad they support the local breweries thus next time I come back it's for drinks and of course their hummus! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It make you feel like eating out in Europe. The service deserve an A+, as well as the food. Check out the local brews including a great  IPA from here in Tempe. The tea selection is unique. Don't miss the Pomegranate tea and the kebab with Persian rice. Yum!!"}
{"text":"I had head such good things in the past about the owner from his prior ventures that we had to try his new place Nush!  So, brought the family out for a Friday night meal...It was an wonderful evening...with plenty of parking and seating (both indoor and outdoor) it was a pleasure.  Nush had a great ambiance and decor making it a unique atmosphere for families to private parties...
We shared a number of appetizers from the Nush Fries (actually ordered them twice as they were so good) to the cutlets and Yogurt Dip with Naan...the kids could not stop eating it...Our Entrees were just as good...from the protein bowl with Chicken and Quinoa to the Zucchini Linguini..everyone loved it and we can't wait to go back.
The owner came by and chatted with us for a while...we can't wait to go back and enjoy Nush again!  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"These guys are the absolute best and it is a great spot to go if you don't want to deal with Mill Avenue. I went on a lot of first dates here and it always impressed and was much more adult than the surrounding Tempe scene. I will miss them as I am moving."}
{"text":"My roommate & I decided to try this place out yesterday,  we saw that it was finally open. I'm so glad we did! The ambiance is amazing! The colors were refreshing. The general layout of the resturant was very open & airy. The food was unique & fresh my a Basmati  rice had pomegranate & Quinoa in it. My roommate ordered the zucchini linguine which was very flavorful & the portion size was perfect. I ordered the Chicken Protein Bowl....The flavor in the chicken was to die for! Very juicy & flavorful! We also ordered the fries & Pomegranate Frozen Yogurt. Of course they were both amazing! We both have worked in customer service & we really enjoyed our waiter he went above and beyond to assist us. The general manager was also there and was very polite and inviting."}
{"text":"Nush is one of those places where you feel right at home. It is definitely a plus that their food is fresh, delicious and made to order. The red chicken wrap was very flavorful and the way that the basmati rice filling was seasoned reminded me of the flavors of the chicken and rice carts in NYC. Thanks to the wonderful recommendation from Nona, the owner! I will definitely be back for more Nush goodness."}
{"text":"It was a quiet evening on the patio. We were able to have our dog join us and our waiter, Jeremy was absolutely great! We thoroughly enjoyed the Nush fries with yogurt dip as a starter. I had a great glass of wine and the red chicken wrap. Both were excellent! My husband had the same glass of wine and the protein bowl with all 3 proteins. He loved it! We had great service and wonderful food. We also had the halvah dessert which wasnunique and very tasty. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves food food that is organic and local."}
{"text":"I try to not just give a five star on a first visit to a new eating establishment but I had such a good experience! Both the service and the food was excellent. Nush does sort of a super healthy and organic and local Persian cuisine (by the way, if you do not know, Iran is modern day Persia). I took some folks from work and we tried the Nush fries, as recommend by our waitperson and wow, addictive, I could eat plates of them. Then for the meal I had the spinach and sausage linguine, so good!  For desert we tried the pomegranate ice cream, and it was also lovely. As it was a work lunch and HR forbids me from drinking during a work day (I know, where are the days of MadMen when you need them) I had one of the five or six fresh brewed iced teas that are available and it was also, well, lovely! I believe the owners also stopped by and asked how we liked our meal as well. Honestly, I'm amazed that a place that just opened a short time ago could be just so good across the board, right from the beginning and the location, just lovely - you sort of feel like you are on the patio of a funky house when you sit outside. They also have a number of micro-brews on draft, including In the Ivy, a lovely IPA from Huss brewery - in fact, all the beers on draft are brewed in Arizoan and they have some additional micro-brews in cans and bottles - more local AZ beers but also some excellent ones from out of state such as Bells Two Hearted, one of my favorites. I have to give kudos to a place this close to ASU giving the proverbial finger of fate to the large commercial brewers and it shows a deep understanding of aligning both the food and the beverages with the stated core values of their establishment (see my post on Blasted Barley for a discussion of a place that is showing some confusion on their brand messaging via their beer selection). 

Let's just say that I'm going to be a regular customer of the Nush - great food and service, good selection of craft brews, and lovely location, along with what appears to be some deep knowledge of how to run an eating establishment and project a coherent brand message so as to build a committed relationship with a core customer base over time, nice work folks!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I went to Nush to grab some drinks before brunch, and we were pleasantly surprised by their beer selection. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious freaking food! The yogurt dip with naan was amazing. Protein bowl with beef is a must. The quinoa is adequately seasoned & the portion size is perfect. My boyfriend got the zucchini linguine, which was yummy too! The \"pasta\" was al dente! Plus, the ambience is so eclectic and unique; it has been a great experience. I will most definitely be back to try others."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, mixed feelings about it but will return to try again. Mixed kabob platter with chicken, steak, and veg kabob, over a pile of overcooked basmati rice. Two chunks of chicken, two chunks of beef, rest veggies. $14. Pricey for what you get, yes. Fresh, yes. Flavorful, sort of. Four bites of meat were okay but no marinade on the veggies and no flavor to the rice. Bland food eaters, this place is made for you!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I randomly came here after finding it on yelp almost a month ago when they were first opening.  We circled around because we weren't quite sure where it was.  Then we couldn't find parking.  We were ready to leave only to notice that they had their own private lot, which is awesome.  Then we weren't sure how to get to the restaurant and wandered in.   

We ordered the nush fries which were tasty.  For our main dishes, we had the spinach sausage linguine and the skewers platter.  Both were good portions and had good flavor.  

I was also \"forced\" to order the citrus blossom green tea because my friend wanted to try it... I almost always drink water, but surprisingly really liked the tea and had no problem finishing it. 

The staff was super friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how the \"make a reservation\" through Yelp works but my boyfriend made a birthday dinner reservation for me because I've been telling him how cute Nush looks. He made the reservation through Nush's Yelp page. At that time their page had not been updated to reflect that they are closed for the summer and the reservation was made and went through.

Long story short the reservation was made, my family and I got dressed up and drove to Nush for my birthday dinner. Once we park and walk upstairs, the doors are closed and locked and chairs are put up on the tables. And now their Yelp page says Closed. Happy Birthday to me. I was incredibly disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Nush for the 1st time this past Monday evening.  A group of us arrived with anticipation of great food, service and ambience as described in most reviews.  We were not disappointed at all when we asked if we could pull two 4 tops (tables) together just outside on the patio that we set up for us.  

It was my wife's birthday and she loves good Mediterranean/Euro-Persian food.  Waters with cucumber (new to us) was a refreshing change.  We ordered the nush killer fries and organic hummus to start, possibly the best hummus I have had in a very long time with freshly made pitas hot off the wood fired stone oven. 

I ordered the red chicken wrap with pomegranate green tea.  The subtle spice flavor, roasted veggies, amazing fired roasted chicken a rice was savored with every bite.  The tea was properly sweeten and tasty.  My wife ordered the Kabob solo and two in our group ordered the skewers combo platter with chicken, beef and veggie skewers on bed of rice.  I asked once if their taste buds were happy and just got smiles from both.

Lastly the service was on point.  Attentive, considerate and prompt with all our requests. Enough said, we'll be back to try more deliciousness."}
{"text":"Good food and lovely people. Quirky but pleasant ambiance. The roasted vegetables were outstanding. The sauce with the chicken legs was excellent. The pomegranate iced tea was very flavorful. Handicap accessibility a bit off-putting. We thought the menu a bit limited in the meat department. Special kudos for adjusting to our requests. We will return with friends."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick bite before a play at Gammage. Found it thru Yelp and my two friends expressed they hoped it would be good.  It was better than good.

Walking up, it was had such a cool vibe - one woman said it reminded her of Seattle, another said California, and I thought it could have been New York too. What's for sure, it did NOT seem to be in Phoenix (and That it is a compliment).

It was 6PM on a Wed and we were the only patrons there. No one else came the whole time until we left at 7. They don't know what they're missing!

We started with the organic Hummus. OMG! The best I have ever had. WAAAY better than that P...Jungle Place (which I like-I do!). 

One woman ordered the Spinach & Garbanzo - which is an appetizer-but plenty hardy enough as a meal. It was scrumptious-the best of our three items I think. I will order that next time for sure.

I ordered the Protein Bowl-with chicken. Very tasty. The rice was so good I almost ate all of it-and I'm so picky on rice I hardly ever eat much. SCORE.

My other friend loved the Hummus so much that is what she ordered for dinner! BTW, the naan they serve with it is SO soft and melt in your mouth wonderful, IT was the best I have ever had.

I am so sorry that gal who wrote that 1 star-review wasn't able to eat here on her birthday-she would have loved it. 
Come back-give them  another chance! You won't regret it!

The ONLY reason it didn't get 5 stars was because even though we were the ONLY patrons, and even though the waiter was very sweet and nice, he disappeared and we always had to hunt him or yell out for items, more wine, etc.    (BTW, that red Argentina wine was sooooo
good.)

Felt that shouldn't happen when the place was deserted of clients. He's young, he'll learn       (I hope).

And people!  COME HERE!!  Support the delicious, healthy places that dare to step outside the (boring Phoenix) box re: food.

Sorry no pic's, the food was gone in a flash."}
{"text":"What a gem! We happened across Nush and the patio looked so invited, we wandered up to check it out and decided to stay for lunch. So glad we did!

The atmosphere is really cute, and our server was great, but the absolute star was the food. Wow!! I'm an adamant meat eater (and they do have meat dishes that looked great), but ended up eating vegan and really enjoyed my meal. 

We had the green beans which were delicious with a citrus and roasted garlic topping, and the fries, which seemed roasted and had a great texture. Then had the roasted veggie salad which was huge and also had that delicious, mild roasted garlic on it. 

Definitely will be a must visit again when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great lunch at Nush today!  Sat on the beautiful patio and enjoyed a refreshing pomegranate green tea.  Our lunch of Nush fries and a chicken protein bowl was delicious.  Great service and the owners even stopped by to see how our lunch was.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved it. Five stars except for the menu which was Spartan with information. Will go back when in AZ"}
{"text":"I would bring a friend here that needs convincing that vegan food can be tasty too. Get them to order a wrapper delight."}
{"text":"I came here to visit my brother at asu. We chose this place because we had someone in our party that is a vegan. The food here was pretty yummy. We ordered the everything salad, the mahzeh  plate, the beef solo kebab, the roasted vegetable salad, and the coconut curry. The service was very friendly. They even filled up my camelback with the pomegranate green tea on our way out. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Found our new favorite restaurant. When was the last time that the owners come out, visit and give a warm thank you?  This place does!

Protein Bowl n Red Chicken Wrap, yum!  Looking forward to our next date night here. :-)"}
