{"text":"Elf makes me so happy!!!!! As a connoisseur of fondue, I'm always looking for new places to try in addition to making all kinds of fondue at home. Everybody Loves Fondue does not disappoint. They serve the traditional Swiss fondue (emmenthaler & gruyere) as well as a beer cheese fondue. Our favorite is the Swiss! The dipper selection is endless (so many choices...) and all fondue comes with bread which can be refilled at your request. This was our second visit and the new addition to the dippers was French fries which were soft and not over cooked, perfect for dipping in fondue! The ambiance is casual and very family friendly and the walls have lots of decor using the dessert dippers-really cute. While I'm on the topic of dessert, the chocolate fondue is incredible!!!!!! They have so many options-white, dark, and milk chocolate and sea salt caramel or peanut butter and they will gladly mix two together. We tried the milk chocolate and sea salt caramel...dipping a creme puff in there is heaven! The owners are friendly and customize anything to your liking. Last night they were even taking \"Elfies\" to put on the wall as their mascot is an elf. Thumbs up for creativity. The restaurant is run with love, compassion, and a love of brining fondue to everyone (at a much lower price). They even have a truck (maybe for free samples!?). Don't forget to ask for a stamp card when you go, every 6th fondue is free!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly owners. The Swiss and dark chocolate fondue were the best. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"AWESOME.....AWESOME!! Fondue was very very good. We ordered the assortment of breads, veggies and ham with cheddar cheese. Dessert, topped off the whole meal....very good! Service was great and the service was top notch. As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile. Girl behind the counter was very helpful and explained the process. Totally recommend this place and will surely be back"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great tasting cheese, chocolates and dippers. All the great elements of fondue without the hassle, long wait or high cost of a traditional fondue restaurant. Plan to stop here whenever I crave some melted goodness. Ps. The melted dark chocolate with strawberries to dip is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! Fondue at very affordable prices! The owners are the sweetest and most kind people ever! They really go above and beyond to make sure you have a fun experience in their restaurant. The fondue is delicious! You HAVE to try their homemade rice crispy treats.  SOOO good!"}
{"text":"Yummy....what a great idea! Much more reasonable than the other Fonude place but not as fancy either.  For about $5.00 you get a small...that is enough to share a snack. This is a great place to grab lunch or sit and visit over cheese and chocolate goodness. I loved the Swiss and White Chocolate fondues and the choice of 'dippers' is sure to please everyone.  We love to support locally owned places and we will surely be back! A sandwich, cheese fondue, chocolate fondue, two drinks and a yummy rice crispy treat to go.....about $22.00  Oh and E.L.F.....Everybody Loves Fondue.....yes we do!"}
{"text":"I love fondue. I like the chocolate.  My favorite dippers are pound cake, strawberries and Rice Krispie treats. We like both cheddar and swiss. I have been back many times."}
{"text":"Love the owners! They are so friendly and are always happy to have us. The Swiss cheese is so delicious. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Such a cool place with GREAT food! The family that owns this place is nice. It's a fun, unique experience that you don't get to have at other restaurants! I highly suggest tying this amazing place out!!"}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about affordable fondue. Great idea but hard to realize. The Swiss was great, the cheddar was awful. We also had the milk chocolate which was good, not fantastic & the Peanut butter which was another fail. We had a good time trying the menu but 2 cheese & 2 dessert fondues put us back $50 for a family of 4. Not my idea of affordable, especially when we left still hungry.  I also thought the decor was lacking. I honestly felt like I was in a school cafeteria."}
{"text":"Our new family favorite!   The menu fits so many different situations!  My husband takes my daughter after school for great veggies and cheese.  My husband and I have had a complete meal just the two of us.  And my favorite . . . we go after dinner for an awesome dessert and some family time.  Very affordable,  tons of choices, and friendly welcoming staff will help this become your favorite too!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! If I could dip my wife's toes in this fondue is the only way it could be even better! Went as couples, we got one medium salty caramel fondue and one medium milk chocolate fondue with a pile of fruit and goodies to dip in it! Really fun! Got a picture in their little elf cut-outs and we will remember our time together forever! We are coming back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of a coupon. We were both pleasantly surprised to find an amazing fondue restaurant that we didn't have to dress up for. The food was wonderful and the owners were equally pleasant to visit with. We ordered both the cheddar and Swiss cheese, loved both. But the best part was the chocolate dipping sauce. We would have liked to drink it. What a great new concept for a fondue restaurant. It's always interesting to see new ideas from young people that put their heart and soul into a new adventure."}
{"text":"The service and staff was amazing, which is why I give it a one.  I felt the fondue lacked flavor and tasted watered down.  Based on the other reviews I was quite disappointed.   We actually paid and left to go to Tia Rosa next door which is super yummy."}
{"text":"A casual, sit down, but not quite a restaurant, type atmosphere for fondue! I loved the ease of ordering and the fun,  quality dipping choices. Would be a great place to go for dessert or a light lunch. We wanted to return with the kids!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, friendly service, delicious dessert. Considerably cheaper than a traditional fondue restaurant. Also family friendly. Love to support small business owners!"}
{"text":"Incredible! This is a much better dessert alternative to frozen yogurt and whatnot. This is a family owned and operated business and the employees are passionate about making it a great experience for everyone. Everything was fresh and delicious. The chocolate was the perfect texture."}
{"text":"Everybody Loves Fondue was a special experience. The pretzels and cheese were mighty good, but we never found the Elf."}
{"text":"I grew up eating homemade fondue and this was BETTER than I remember!! The Swiss fondue was so good it took me back to Christmas Eve as a kid!! I loved it so much, I had to bring my kids back the next day. We also got dessert to go and the Rice Krispie treat was AMAZING!! Such a warm, family friendly environment, but perfect for a date-night too!! The service was beyond exceptional and the owners love what they do!! Planning on being friends and family often!"}
{"text":"I really wanted it to be good but it wasn't. Fondue should be at your table in something to keep it warm if nothing else. Nothing was hot by he time I got to the table. The cheese was cold and stuck to the cardboard paper they gave it to me in. And it certainly wasn't cheap enough to match the cheapness of the fondue. Never again."}
{"text":"You can go to tons of places in the valley for great food. The thing that sets this restaurant apart from the rest is the unique concept and outstanding customer service. 

I've been here a few times now and each time the owners have not only treated me like family but acknowledged my kid and even remembered her name when she waved bye to them on the way out!! Because of the chill environment, (no blaring music, I'm getting too old for really loud restaurants) this joint is perfect to bring a date, the entire family or even a group of girlfriends to catch up with. 

I've tried many of the delicious dipper combinations and so far my absolute favorite would have to be their homemade Rice Krispie treats (careful they are addictive) with peanut or milk chocolate fondue. 

Also, I am a restroom snob and it was so clean here that I almost expected the toilet paper end to be folded into a \"v\" like they do at nice hotels. 

Impressed."}
{"text":"Good fast fondue! And the owners and staff are the nicest folks you will ever meet. This place is super casual, so swing by in shorts and a t-shirt and relax! I always leave with a smile and a happy tummy. Sure the wife and I enjoy dressing up on our anniversary for fancy fondue, but the other times we are thrilled to have Everybody Loves Fondue!"}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. The owners are the best, and their employees are great too!!! We just left and I'm currently stuffed full of awesome, they don't skimp on portions there's always plenty of fondeu and dippers with your order.

If you are reading this and it's December then you MUST get the holiday peppermint chocolate, hands down amazing!!!! We enjoy coming here and love supporting this local business!! We will be back often since according to my 9 year old this was the best dinner EVER!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love.  My wife and I love this place.  The owners are friendly and everything is very very clean.  Great family place to have some dessert and talk.  My favorite is the Swiss and Ham.  Wish they were open Sundays since that is when we have the most time available but it is worth it to go weeknights.  Highly recommended to everyone!"}
{"text":"Lots of great options/combinations! Love this place. The owners are so nice and friendly. Great place to bring someone visiting out of town, going on a date, or take the whole family. Delicious food for a great price."}
{"text":"Dessert was our favorite. The owners really are very welcoming & nice! They were also helpful when we asked for recommendations. Great little family place!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  I highly recommend the large Rice Krispy Treats-they're homemade and taste amazing. This was the first time we've been here and we're hooked. We'll definitely be back to try the sandwiches. Great new place here in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"This place was great. We had dinner before a show at Tuscany Theater. We were running out of time and Asher if they would hold the desert fondue until after the show expecting to be done right at 9:00 which was their closing time. Besides the fondue being great the owners went way above and beyond to provide excellent customer service. Fantastic food and service."}
{"text":"What an unexpected amazing experience. Their menu is full of limitless combinations. It is a MUST try! Extremely great price point to come in for a little & stay for a lot."}
{"text":"I think this is a cute concept but it could definitely use some rethinking in some areas, which I will explain. 

My husband and I went a few weeks ago, everything was explained to us so we got the biggest meal to split and added one extra side on (we like trying a bunch of stuff the first time we go anywhere). I thought the cheese was awesome, like I would literally dunk anything in it. What I didn't think was awesome was all the dippers, those could definitely use some elevating. I feel like everything was just purchased at Costco or Sams Club and heated up, which isn't very exciting especially for the cost of it. Our meal also came with dessert which we liked. Still just a bunch of store bought stuff cut up, but it tasted good. 

My main suggestion would be heighten the quality of the dippers - grill your own chicken, lightly steam and season the veggies, ect. Maybe offer less options but the ones you do offer make really well. I could see us coming back for dessert for fun one night, but I don't think we would come back for dinner unless somethings changed."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. They forgot something in my order and ran out to the parking lot to chase me down to make sure i received it."}
{"text":"Exceptional customer service. The owners are genuine and really care about your experience. You can't go wrong with any of the dessert options on the menu. We have yet to try the cheese dip. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this place often! The Ghirardelli chocolate fondue was phenomenal and with all the different kinds, you really can't go wrong! I've had both the cheddar and the Swiss cheese fondue and both were to die for! Very kid friendly and the service was phenomenal. The owners are so sweet and made me and my family feel welcome. Certainly suggest this!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't really call this place fondue ... more like \"dip\". But everything was delicious and the people are super friendly and that means a lot. Nice clean , cute little place. we had the Swiss cheese dip and it was delicious. We had the milk chocolate for dessert and it was also super delicious. will be back!"}
{"text":"If you like paying 10$+ for powdered burnt cheese (yuck), day old frozen chicken (gross), and waiting half hour to be served (yawn) this place might be for you. I tried it because I love fondu, but this place is a poor example of what fondu should be. HORRIBLE AVOID!!!"}
{"text":"A great idea for some amazing food. Choose a dip( like the delicious all-natural peanut dip, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate or cheese) and then choose the sides. It can be hard to choose from all the savory and sweet options, but they give some great suggestions. Some amazing dessert combinations were Rice Krispie treats bites dipped in peanut sauce and milk chocolate. I also loved strawberries and pound cake with dark chocolate. 
There are lots of combinations, enough to please most everyone, and will bring you back for more. I live out of state, but I'll definitely be back when I'm down this way again. Wish it was up in San Francisco!"}
{"text":"We were in town looking for a unique place to eat that was not a national chain. A fun affordable place. It was all good however the swiss cheese fondue was especially delicious. The white and milk chocolate equally incredible. If we lived here we would go back!"}
{"text":"We are from New York and visiting family in the area, we ventured off and we stopped at ELF to try the fondue after reading reviews. We were not disappointed! I agree that the menu can be confusing, but the owner explained everything. The staff was friendly and refilled the kids marshmallows. We ordered the medium combo with milk chocolate, strawberries, marshmallows, churro and angel food cake, plus an additional small dark chocolate. Everything was fresh and delicious!! It was a unique and fun place to eat. We will return!!!"}
{"text":"I got a Groupon a couple of weeks ago and used it last night.  Their current prices have increased from their website or since the Groupon.  False advertising?  1. I understand that most restaurants reserve the rights to change prices, however, I and I'm sure most Grouponers check out the vendor's site and prices before purchase.  2. The have \"Cheese Meals\"  and \"dessert Meals\" listed with a little of a discount if you add the individual items together, however, the all items are added a la carte and ends up more than the listed \"meal\" prices.   Got the Large cheese meal listed $18.99 ended up $19.95, because I used the Groupon??

The cheese fondue was ok, nothing special.  The bread which is now included in the cheese fondue isn't anything to write about.  Some menu items are no longer offered.  The dark chocolate was good, beware you pay more for strawberries, how can you not get strawberries if you get chocolate?  It would be nice if they would give you a little plate or something to eat off of.  

Also you walk up, order and pay - you are asked on the screen if you want to add a tip before getting your service, which is minimal.   I can see them giving you less of the premium item if you don't tip.

Kid friendly."}
{"text":"Really great food for really fair prices with excellent, friendly service! Can't wait to try it again!!! 

."}
{"text":"This was just ok. The processed chicken was really gross and we didn't touch it once I saw what it was. How hard would it be to buy chicken breasts in bulk and grill them up?  We did like the Swiss cheese fondue with the apples, veggies, bread and pretzel. However the fondue doesn't stay hot for long since it's not in an actual fondue pot but a styrofoam cup. If you don't eat it fast enough It gets gummy. We also had the milk chocolate fondue. Tasted funny not great. Probably won't go back and I was disappointed given all the great reviews. For what I spent I left hungry as did my husband.

I was also very disappointed in the amount of waste. Everything is served in disposable cups and trays. That adds up fast."}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars because the ladies were so friendly and sweet at the counter. Maybe I'm not the fondue type? We ordered the medium meal with Swiss cheese, pretzels, bread, and salami.  Then for dessert we ordered the chocolate mixed with peanut butter, pineapples, strawberries, bananas, Angel food cake, and cream puffs.  Everything was fresh. But I would never go back. It was nothing special to me. And just tasted average."}
{"text":"i cannot say ENOUGH good things about this place. it's in a great location, the restaurant is casual and decorated so nicely. super family friendly. the owners are the nicest people you'll meet, so friendly and passionate about their business. The service is perfect. The fondue is INCREDIBLE, and very reasonably priced. i got the milk chocolate and white chocolate swirled fondue with strawberries, marshmallows, and brownies. It's my personal favorite, but all of their fondue is excellent. The swiss fondue with ham and broccoli is incredible as well. i recommend it to anyone, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"My daughter, my niece and myself try to come out here at least once a month for a \"girls date\" it's super cute, simple, reasonably priced, and amazingly delicious! All 3 of us share a medium mixed cheese (I think it's called sweddar for Swiss and cheddar) and a small or medium (depending how much of a sweet tooth we have) milk or dark chocolate! They have all kinds of dippers to choose from. The place is clean and the owners are always friendly. We went on a Saturday night around 7 and there was about 8 people there. The service was prompt, the food was fresh and we had no complaints! My niece spilled her entire container of chicken and they replaced it free of charge. They even have a punch card which is awesome for us frequent fondue-ers! Every visit has been pleasant for us which keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. Super casual and cute. The fondue was great and the selection in dippers was great. Came with my friend and it was a fun experience. Would be great for a cute date also."}
{"text":"I've been following this place on IG for awhile and finally tried it. I'm so glad I did! Everything was delicious. I want to go back and try everything."}
{"text":"A date night is never complete until you have ELF. Oh my goodness so delicious. Every single thing here is delicious no matter what you dip what in. Highly recommend you try everything at least once. Bill and Celine are the sweetest people to top it off. Great food and great customer service, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this place since our toddlers love to dip things! But sadly we won't be returning. 

First of all we get inside and there's nobody up front. No bell for service so I stand there for a few minutes trying to figure out if I should yell. After awhile someone came up from the back and gave me a lukewarm hello. 

There were 4 of us (2 adults & 2 toddlers) so I opted for the $22 large cheddar plate. What came out made my husband & I laugh because it was so hilariously low quality. The taquitos looked like they were straight from a Del Monte taquito box. The cubes of ham were bland and the assortment of veggies were also the precut kind you can buy bagged. The pretzel was good & the bread okay.  Cheese was good. Twenty two bucks was seriously an outrageous sum to pay for a handful of each of the components. If it they were high quality ingredients I'd suck it up buuuut they weren't. And I have to say the napkins were like tissue paper. Wiping all the dripped cheese up with them was impossible. Maybe not as kid friendly as advertised. 

We also got the medium chocolate tray and it was better. Not blow-your-mind-I-can't-live-without-it good but we enjoyed it. So maybe only come here if you want dessert."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed took my daughter here for her 19th birthday. Food was blah seemed all processed food. Like dips out of a jar. Staff okay. Food wasn't good."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Several cheese and chocolate fondue options to choose from. Friendly employees were super helpful! Bread is delicious and unlimited with any cheese fondue. Milk chocolate with bananas was divine - loved it!! Will definitely come back again. Would highly recommend for a cheap date night or fun with kiddos!"}
{"text":"If you like fondu you will like this place.  Totally different, the cheddar and pretzel with ham was amazing!  And the best was the dessert!"}
{"text":"Everybody Loves Fondue or E.L.F. is THE place to go for super delicious fondue. Cute location with seating outside and inside. Affordably priced.  Order pre-created meal options or pick your own creations. The Cheddar cheese fondue is super delicious and the Swiss cheese fondue is crazy addictive. There is a large variety of dippers from meats, breads, veggies and sweets. Of course, the sweet dippers would be more for the mouth watering ,can't get enough chocolate fondue options dark, milk and white! We tried  both cheddar and swiss with pretzals, chips amd bread; as well as, the white chocolate with bananas, strawberries,  pound cake and mini cream puffs. One bite and we just couldn't stop until not one drop of fondue was left. Super friendly staff that goes above and beyond to make you feel welcomed! Just fantastic!! Definitely will be going back over and over!!!!!"}
{"text":"Owners are so friendly!! Perfect fondue, so delicious, lots of fun dippers. Great for families. Casual but so tasty. We've even done take out with great success. I come here as often as possible."}
{"text":"I write this review as I lay in bed dreaming of Salted Caramel and Peanut Chocolate fondu. As I wish I had a side of strawberries to go with it.

ELF (Everybody Loves Fondu) is on point. Absolutely everything about this place screams \"AMAZE-BALLS\". Everything is 100% fresh and delicious. It was by far the most delicious thing I have ever had, ever. I noticed they delivered when I got home (just before I started writing this review) and almost died for the second time tonight; the first time coming after I ate here. (Died meaning a good thing... like this was soooo good).

We ordered the Cheese Meal (small) which came with French and Ciabatta bread, a side (we chose a soft pretzel stick) and a cup of either cheddar cheese, Swiss cheese or schwedder (Swiss and cheddar combined). We opted for the cheddar and it was amazing. Perfectly seasoned breads, the soft pretzel tasted like Jesus just made it with love; that's how good it was. Aside from the cheddar, we also ordered the small milk chocolate fondu which comes with 3 sides. We chose strawberries, pineapples and a churro. Now, let me tell you.. this chocolate fondu was like a cup of greatness. It was so good. The strawberries and pineapples were extremely fresh and the churro was so fluffy and warm and delicious and.. AHH! So flippin' good.

I will be back tomorrow. Just kidding, I might go back tonight. It was so good, I'd recommend it to anyone, even if that means you having to walk 7 miles in the scorching July heat. It's far worth any stroke you may suffer. Lol. It's funny because it's true. This place is heaven on earth."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere, excellent chocolate, and good portions for the price. It's hard to rate this place anything less than 5 stars after filling your face with chocolate dipped strawberries and pineapple. We will be filling up our frequent fondue card very quickly!"}
{"text":"Everything they serve is over priced and frozen from Costco- you're better off making your own fondue at home. We went in on their \"family night\", there were only 2 families there prior to us and we had to wait for 45 minutes for our food to come out (I checked in with them twice asking how much longer and was told 5 more minutes each time). Young high school kids running this place sitting around doing nothing- not a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but this is not at all what we expected. When you walk in it looks like a fast food cafe and you order your food at a counter. There is no fondue pot that comes out to your table like at a Melting Pot. Your food comes out on a tray in paper and styrofoam containers. The cheddar cheese dip tasted good, but didn't stay warm long for a social dinner. Can't speak to the other meats, but the chicken strips were dry and not good. They looked like the ore-cooked meats you buy for salads in the deli section. The chocolate dip was good, but also doesn't stay warm long. If you're looking for a fast meal of dips (or sandwiches) this place might be for you. If you're looking for the traditional fondue experience, you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Surprisingly amazing, because I expected The Melting Pot.  I was ready for filet.  What I got was wonderful service, amazing Swiss fondue with the perfect bread, and a pocket full of the cash I would have dropped at TMP.  I also ordered jalapeños and broccoli.  I wish I would have ordered a larger size of Swiss because my Hubs ate half of mine.  My kids ordered the milk chocolate that I also tried for dessert.  The chocolate is all Ghiradelli, smooth and sinful.  The owner was wonderful and explained how things work.  His daughter was working with him, I love a family run business!  The decor was minimalist, industrial fabulous.  The floors are amazing epoxied cement.  I want them in my house!  There are cute yellow Tolix replica chairs around each metallic reflective table.  Once people find out what a great little shop they have here they're going to need some patio seating.  I can see it now with just two potted perfect Lady Slippers and the same beautiful chairs and tables.  Check out Everybody Loves Fondue, no regrets, except apples.  I should have ordered apples for my swiss as well."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, great food and excellent customer service.  Will definitely return.  We saw this on Sonoran Living this morning and came to lunch and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"We just ate here!  It was so good!  
Casual, kid friendly affordable!  
The owners are great people very welcoming and friendly!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, very clean and delicious. They explained how everything works and were very helpful. I would return again and bring others."}
{"text":"It was AMAZING our kiddos absolutely loved it!!! The service was FANTASTIC, great place to take the family! We loved all the dips milk chocolate, salted caramel, Swiss cheese and peanut butter. Try them all day if you can"}
{"text":"If you are seeing this review, stop reading and go! You will thank me later.

E.L.F. (Everybody loves fondue) is not only excellent in name, but the service and product back it up 100%! 

My girlfriend and I love fondue but it is always expensive, so after driving by ELF for the 100th time and seeing it's amazing reviews we stopped in for dinner and dessert! 

We got the cheddar meal as well as the medium chocolate deal which they were kind enough to mix with white chocolate to make my favorite ying yang chocolate!

We thought maybe they keep the prices so reasonable by using pre made or cheaper ingredients? NOPE! The bread was fresh from a local bakery (and ridiculously good) veggies were all super fresh and the rice crispy treats that came with the chocolate dip were home made!

I would give this place a 100/100 for what they do! Great ingredients, an amazingly nice staff, who didn't mind us taking a century to decide which dippers we wanted!

If you are still reading this you a) have too much time on your hands or b) should be dippin your favorite item into your favorite cheese or chocolate!

Seriously Do Not Pass Up This Local Gem!

Perfect for dates, kids, old people, cheese heads, or people who enjoy food."}
{"text":"Excellent service, cool atmosphere, and very tasty!  Highly recommended!  The fruit is really fresh and the chocolate is to die for."}
{"text":"I would come here for the service even if the food wasn't wonderful. The owners were in when I went and it was near closing time and she told us not to worry and to take our time that she still had some clean up to do. We got the cheddar cheese with a pretzel to start off and it was amazing! Then we finished it with some milk chocolate with strawberries, rice krispy bites and pound cake. All of it was to die for and completely exceeded my expectations. This is a great place to go for a little treat outside of your ordinary snack or dessert but it is still affordable! Will definitely be returning soon!!!"}
{"text":"Dip bread, veggies,pretzels, meat and cheese in chocolate, cheese, peanut butter and enjoy. Soooo good. Sooo good."}
{"text":"Love this cute little place..  yummy next time will customize my order..Nice people great customer service."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun. Here with the mini kid for lunch on his Spring Break. We tried the Small Cheddar Cheese with corn dogs added. For dessert we got the Small Milk Chocolate which came with strawberries, brownies, and marshmallows. We got the white chocolate as well, which was outstanding. Yum yum yum... Now... Sugar rush into food coma.
Fun place & the owners were super nice with great customer service. We'll definitely be back with the rest of the family :)"}
{"text":"We are big fans of fondue but usually go to places like Melting Pot. We have been wanting to try this place for awhile so we finally decided to give it a try make dinner out of cheese and chocolate. 

The place is very causal without much ambiance, which is totally fitting because it is FILLED with children having play dates. We were pretty surprised that it's such a huge kid hangout because it's not cheap. 

Long story short, the place is quite busy and it can take awhile to get your food. The fondue was good but not great. I do think it would be for children (but seems like and expensive option to me but maybe the kids don't eat much so they can share?). 

The owner was friendly, food was okay... it's just not our scene."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times! Love it! It's great to have a fondue option that isn't pricey like the Melting Pot. Good quality chocolate and cheese. My kids love it too. It's a fun meal option. I've brought out of town friends as well, and they've loved it too. Great for the whole family!"}
{"text":"We weren't sure what to get when we arrived.  We just knew we wanted to try it!   I asked for suggestions and we ended up getting the cheese dinner special, there was a lot of food!  We got cheddar with chicken, broccoli, cauliflower, pretzel and foccacia.  We also got a milk chocolate dip with rice krispie treats, nilla wafers and oreos.  Everything was amazing!

Seeing the \"A\" rating in the window is always a bonus, too!  The place was clean, inviting, and comfortable.  Everything was prepared for us and brought to our table nice and hot (if it was supposed to be).  A very enjoyable experience.

We will be back. :)"}
{"text":"Great fondue! Great service! Greeted by the owners, she was really friendly and gave us great recommendations to try. Our favorite was the Swiss fondue and it was great with the pretzel, French bread and green apple slices. Our favorite desert was the milk chocolate fondue with the cream puffs! Omg!!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great sauces to dip. Tons of choices of \"dippers\"... Great bang for your buck if you want affordable fondue."}
{"text":"We're fans!  We stopped in for dessert one night and it was such a fun experience to share with the family.  We had salted caramel and milk chocolate fondue and both were delicous!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere feels like a hip fro-yo place.  Easy and family friendly, the staff was as friendly, nice, prompt  and went the extra mile for us.  

Other fondue places, while also delicious, are crazy expensive.  This place is affordable, and I was afraid to get a small because I was hungry, but I should have because it would have been plenty. The Swiss was amazing, and we got a sample of the white chocolate and it was divine.

Definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Literally this is just Costco food that they put in the microwave along with a side of melted cheese... hardly fondue don't waste your time here... really good service though gotta say but when it comes to food it's pretty gross and overpriced like if I wanted soggy microwave food I would have made some my self I honesty don't know how they gave good reviews"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. I read their menu online so I thought I had an idea on what to get. However, when we arrived their menu seemed much smaller. It was very difficult to read/understand. I think they had more than what their menu in store stated, but I'm not certain. It would have been helpful if their menu was clearer.

We got a large cheddar. It came with a large thing of cheese, one pretzel, a small tray of veggies, a small tray of cubed ham, and thing of bread. We also opted to add one fries. The cheese and pretzel were the best out of the bunch, and were really tasty. The other food items were marginal. 

By this point we weren't really feeling dessert. So I have no feedback on that. Next time we will just opt for dessert."}
{"text":"Finally affordable and fast fondue. Great concept and I love taking everyone there! 

The lunch food is awesome, but the desserts are the best!

Place is super clean - and unlike the other fondue places they are clean and hygienic!"}
{"text":"WOW!! Amazing Chocolate and Cheese. The Peanut butter is a MUST! I like it best with bananas. The Pretzels are the best I have found anywhere near by and the Cheddar is equally as good. Bring the whole family, very kid friendly. They even have catering which would be great for any office party or hanging around watching sports. It's a must in my book."}
{"text":"Gotta have it. Great place for family and friends alike. We have been going to this place for sometime and are never disappointed. A true Arizona treasure. family owned and operated. Why go to a chain when you can make a difference right here and for less money. We always make a point to celebrate at ELF."}
{"text":"Amazing fondue! They have a sandwich which you wouldn't normally think to try but it's awesome! Focaccia bread with ham and cheese! Awesome atmosphere and very fresh food. Great ownership and location. Way cheaper than any other fondue place and much better too. No wait and no need to dress up. It's my new favorite place"}
{"text":"It was a little pricier than we expected, but still way cheaper than any other fancy fondue place. The Swiss dip was just as good as what you would get at The Melting Pot. The cheddar was good, but simple. The chocolate dip was AMAZING. Get the dark chocolate and salted caramel mix. Definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I brought my 3 nieces and nephew and ordered the large cheese and medium chocolate dessert. Everything was devoured within minutes and we even orderd another pretzel and corn dogs. Bill, I think the owner was AWESOME! He was super nice and always had a smile on his face. Great place to take the kids/nieces/nephews but beware the sugar rush afterwards. ;) Thanks, Bill!"}
{"text":"Very yummy! We tried both the cheddar fondue and the swiss fondue - delicious. Prices are reasonable and the owners are extremely friendly. On the way out we were offered a sample of their white chocolate fondue - incredible! We will definitely be coming back. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great place! We got take out for the kids and sitter while we have date night! Very yummy and accommodating staff! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is sugar paradise! It was my daughters  birthday and she wanted to go to this place. As soon as we walked  in we felt welcomed. They heard it was my daughters birthday and they gave her a free side and they even lit a candle for her. The sides were yummy and the chocolate was awesome. I would definitely recommend this place. I have to try the cheese one next time I go."}
{"text":"This is a must visit, we will definitely be back! Cheddar cheese was our favorite on the savory side, Swiss was also great! The pretzels were our preferred 'dippers' for the cheese. On the sweet side we tried the salted caramel, white chocolate, and milk chocolate. All were delicious, the fruit was very fresh and all dippers we tried on the sweet side did not disappoint! One in our party said she'd like to drink the salted caramel it is so good!

The owner and crew were fantastic. Great service and people you really want to give business to. Go give them a try!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I stopped in for a carry out today. The staff was very helpful and super nice! We ordered some dark chocolate, juicy strawberries, pound cake, a soft pretzel and creamy cheddar cheese. Every bite was wonderful! We cannot wait to eat-in and bring our family and friends! Plus, the entire cafe was very clean. (Being a clean freak, this means a lot) 
Thanks ELF for serving quality food in a wonderful environment!!"}
{"text":"Went in here on a wimb after eating dinner down the street. Ordered desert to go. It was amazing. Chocolate and strawberries and the best rice Krispy treat ever. Was not disappointed.  The staff was super nice and helpful. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's a cool place to go. The owners are super friendly and their salami is way good. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is great! My family and I went there a couple evenings ago and it was a lot of fun. The atmosphere is casual and very clean, and the staff was super friendly. The food was delicious! My favorite was the large pretzel with cheddar cheese. My only complaint/suggestion is that the dipper/dip ratio is a bit off. With both the cheese and the chocolate, all of our dippers were long gone before the dip was gone. I'd love to see a larger quantity of dippers :)!"}
{"text":"Food and staff get 5 stars!  Really good food and love the idea of bringing fondue to the masses. Reason for not 5 stars is the confusing menu (make it more like coldstone, step 1: Pick a size; step 2: pick a dip; step 3: pick your dip-ins) and for such a fun concept the decor is lacking. 
I'll be back here and totally recommend to anyone looking for a break from the milkshake and froyo routine."}
{"text":"Great food, except llent service... the owners are so personable and awesome... great place to take your family even better to take the spouse"}
{"text":"Fantastic fondue! We have been regulars here since they opened and every visit has been wonderful! There's nothing better than fresh strawberries dipped in hot milk chocolate. Their ingredients are all super fresh, the restaurant is always very clean, and the owners are extremely friendly. My favorite is the green apples dipped in swiss cheese. So yummy! One of the absolute BEST restaurants in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Great place ! Must check out .
Took the family and had a great time 
Chocolate was perfect 
Excellent customer service 
Very clean"}
{"text":"This place was great! First time here, and definitely coming back. The fruit was fresh, fondue was great, and the owners are super welcoming. Definitely check ELF out - so worth it"}
{"text":"I appreciate an affordable fondue option. The owners are very nice. Restaurant was clean and quiet (which is wonderful considering how many places you go that are so loud you can't hear yourself think). The fondue was good. I liked the swiss the best, my mom liked the cheddar best. We also tried the milk chocolate which was very tasty. I plan to go back again and take my daughter. Very kid-friendly atmosphere and I'm betting I can get her to eat all kinds of veggies if there's cheese to dip them in!"}
{"text":"This is our family's Friday night go to spot. Casual and great for young families, food is always delicious and the ownership is just fantastic. We love it and kinda wish we could keep it a secret..."}
{"text":"First time here. The cheddar cheese is amazing. milk chocolate is amazing. I think the portion of strawberries was a little small. I would recommend having the cashiers ask customers if they want their chocolate now or later. I didn't realize it was a dinner then dessert type of thing. We kept waiting for the chocolate and thought they forgot ya so we asked and the girl said \"oh you want it now?\" Uh, yes, I wasn't all the food I ordered please!"}
{"text":"We came in on Saturday for our first time. It was so good. The pound cake with the chocolate was amazing! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We love E.L.F.! My kids ask to go all the time. The staff is always friendly! We were somewhat annoying one night (not on purpose!), and honestly, the girls working were so nice still! I'm pretty sure I would've been rolling my eyes at myself if I were them, but they kept their composure  They're all sweet and helpful. 

My ONLY complaint is that we don't love the selection of savory dipper options. We like the cheese, so we usually just get some ham & pretzels. We have pretty much decided it's a great place for dessert, but it's not necessarily a place to go if we're actually hungry."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant! My friend and I had a really pleasant experience! The owners were extremely friendly and eager about bringing fondue to customers at a more reasonable price than other restaurants do. They also like doing fun little giveaways so it's a great place for kids and families. Overall a delicious place for lunch or dinner. I ordered the ham and Swiss and added jalapeños which I would recommend because they give the sandwich a nice kick. The cheddar is really good as a fondue and I would highly recommend getting the pretzel or some veggies with it. My friend order the peanut butter fondue sandwich and enjoyed that as well.  They also make all their chocolate fondue is all made from ghiradelli chocolate and really delicious!"}
{"text":"Something different and Really, really good. 

We had no idea what to order so the folks helped us out.  We had a cheddar cheese with bread, pretzel, rolled tacos, veggies and apples.  All really good.  

We also got a dessert plate with milk chocolate.  We had rice crispy treats, cake, cream puffs, apples and strawberries to dip.   Wonderful!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried out this place for the first time, it was really good! We got the milk chocolate with bananas, strawberries, rice crispy treats, brownie bites, and angel food cake.The milk chocolate was simple yet delicious. It would have been nice the see \"limited time\" chocolate and cheese flavors. The fondue seemed kinda basic (which isn't a bad thing, but something a little different would be nice.) my favorite part was the rice Krispy treat it was perfectly made not one bit hard. The brownie bites weren't bad just awkward (the owner warned us but I figured it was worth trying). It seemed like the owners were the ones there working, which is always nice to see. I'd for sure go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I took our 2 small boys to this place tonight for our first try at fondue. Needless to say we ended up frustrated. We were there 30 min waiting and ended up asking for our food to go because it was taking way too long (30 minutes from waiting in line to getting the food). We took our fondue home and it was mediocre at best. The chocolate fondue was a bit watered down. The angle food cake was old and tasteless. And the cream puffs were warm and runny. I wish them the best but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Before this place, I never would have thought you could find a fondue dinner for under $60.  This place was 1/3 the cost of others with twice the selection.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Yum. Cute 'ice cream shop' atmosphere. Three of us shared a large cheese and large chocolate. Sooo many dippers!!! So filling. Perfect evening outside enjoying food and weather."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Chocolate is delicious.
Price is great. Great place to hang out and enjoy some chocolate."}
{"text":"Food is great and the owner is awesome. I highly recommend the rice crispy with white chocolate . We have been here several times and will continue to come back and support our local small business owners!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was prepared to be a little underwhelmed by ELF, having been to the Melting Pot before. But to my delightful surprise, I was the perfect amount of whelmed when I left here. The prices are really good for fondue (a little under $40 for two adults--cheese and chocolate--including tip). The fondue is deceptively filling, until you consider that you're just eating a ton of cheese, chocolate, and bread. Then it makes total sense. A small cheese fondue meal (2 dippers and a drink) and a small chocolate fondue (3 dippers) is the perfect amount of food for an adult (male or female), unless you're a HUGE eater. It took an effort to finish, but I wasn't going to let all that amazing goodness go to waste. It's also nice that you can substitute whatever you want for the dippers. 

Both my friend and I got Swiss cheese fondue, which is very flavorful (even the owner acknowledges it's a little better than the cheddar). I got bread (unlimited) and apples with mine. Delish! My friend had the bread and taquitos (the latter were so-so). We both ordered dark chocolate, but they accidentally gave me milk chocolate and then corrected it, but I got to keep both. The dark is by far the best. We tried cream puffs, strawberries, angel food cake, pineapples, and apples with it. All fantastic. 

The service, though, particularly shines! They bring the cheese first and the chocolate when you're done, so everything stays hot. The staff are all super friendly and helpful. The owners are very chill, too. The restaurant itself is definitely on the spartan side, but that's fine. They keep the music fairly low, perfect for chatting over the meal. The meal is presented like a little picnic. And the restaurant isn't very busy on weekdays at dinner time. A great time to go. Oh, and they have a loyalty card--buy five fondues, get one free. Nice!"}
{"text":"Cute new place.  We had white and dark chocolate fondues with a mixture of fruit and angel food cake.  Chocolate is Ghirardelli. ..so it's yummy.  It needs some decoration on the walls, but the staff is friendly.   Worth a try..we will be back."}
{"text":"Awful....cheese whiz cafeteria food.

Service also took 1/2 an hour and forgot who we were cause it took to long, spend the money on the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"Would have never thought of myself as a foundue lover until I went here.  Great service."}
{"text":"This is a fun and yummy place! Our kids love when we go as a family and get the chocolate. Recently I tried the cheese fondue and it was amazing!  I got cheddar cheese with bread, apples and a pretzel. Me and my daughter shared it and loved it. If you like the Melting Pot but want to spend a fraction of the cost eat here!"}
{"text":"What a fun little spot! We took our two kids here and they were very impressed. They have chicken and fries which they basically live off of. 

The people behind the counter were so helpful and patient and helped us pick the best option for us. 

We got the large cheddar with pretzel, bread, and veggies. And one small milk and one small white chocolate with basically everything on the dessert menu, haha!! Brownies, cheesecake, angel food cake, rice crispy, churro I can't even remember it all! 

I'd love to go back and get other options that got vetoed the first time. Fun atmosphere as well and definitely affordable! Also recommend it for date nights, kids parties or somewhere fun to take out of towners. I think they offer ordering ahead as well as delivery?! Hope I'm right on that one! 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about fondue served in styrofoam cups, but it was awesome!! They gave a lot of dippers with the chocolate and have unlimited bread with the cheese!! They were super nice and friendly! They even accommodated our request to mix caramel, milk chocolate, and peanut butter!! The large is probably enough for ~6 people. The medium looks small but is probably perfect for our family of 4. Best part was the owner's super excited response to my nephew's name, Ronin! :) We will probably come back whenever we visit Gilbert. Who doesn't love chocolate and cheese!! 

Also, the chocolate and cheese stay warm and dippable for the entire dining experience!"}
{"text":"I ordered a small dark chocolate which comes with three dippers - my choices were the pineapple strawberry and gluten free Rice Krispies . My husband got the Swiss cheese and bread and taquidos. It was filling! My service was 5 stars. It was simple delicious and easy to order. Decor was sparse but minimalism is in! Very free and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The food is great, reasonably priced and the owners are so nice!  We will definitely make this a frequent stop."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a Saturday night and it did not disappoint! The dipping options were fantastic, along with the home made Rice Krispies . The owner was very nice and helpful with the menu. We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Incredible. Takes a while to receive your food but worth it. Best deal is to get their pre-chosen meals or deserts and just sub what you actually want. Tried the medium milk chocolate and the medium cheddar cheese, both were great! Will be back with more people."}
{"text":"We are just leaving and super happy with our experience. The employees were so friendly. The food was also sooo yummy. We only got the cheese but next time we plan on trying some dessert. We will be back:)"}
{"text":"Nice place for dessert after a show at the Tuscany Theater!  All the chocolates tasted great! All the dippers were very fresh. I highly recommend the White Chocolate (even if you are a dark chocolate kinda person like me!)  Prices are a tad steep, but nothing compared to the Melting Pot. The service was fast and friendly.  It would be great if they had a coffee bar to go with their chocolate :-)"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has good reviews the cheese was horrible TAST  like hot spray can cheese the chocolate was ok the pretzels was the worst I've ever had DONT GO THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM A LONG TIME AGO"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been coming in here for the past two years and it never disappoints. If you are getting the cheese, the swiss is so good, especially with the green apples and focaccia bread. If you get a meat, the ham is better than the chicken. I usually come in with my friend for dessert, and we both end up spending about $7 with tip on the medium chocolate meal. I would recommend the peanut mixed in with the milk chocolate. The combination of these two is so creamy and not too sweet and it tastes a lot like peanut butter cups.
The service here is great too. When the owners, Bill and Celine are in they are very helpful and they always seem to remember our order! Furthermore, when the younger employees are there, they provide a really friendly atmosphere and are always willing to fix any mistakes (although they rarely make mistakes). This is a great place for a date night or for the whole family."}
{"text":"Finally, this place is on Yelp! 

We went in a few weeks ago.  The owner, Bill, is super friendly and passionate. His energy was contagious. 

We started with the cheddar and swiss, as well as a gamut of sides.  The cheddar was a little bland (I'm an extra sharp cheddar kind of guy), but the swiss was amazing!  The cheddar would be great for kids, though. 

We saved room for dessert, and boy was that a good move!  I had the milk chocolate and peanut (think reeses) and dipped fruits, marshmallows, and a special marshmallowy rice krispy treat into it!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it, and if they were open I would be heading their now! 

I really hope this place succeeds.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Service is A+
Food is A
However my memories of fondue are endearing and magical. The experience fell short for me."}
{"text":"If you love fondue this is a great place to go. Quick and easy! Prices are ok. Chocolate is delicious!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5. No other fondue places around. This place would dominate it anyways. Great atmosphere modern building. Bring the fam and check it out. Recommend that OG strawberries and chocolate!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich with melted Swiss and chicken on fresh foccacia bread, plus dessert treats with hot melted milk and dark chocolate.  So good!"}
{"text":"I have seriously mixed feelings about this place, so I am going to separate the good from the not so good and give an explanation for my rating. 

A little background: I came here with my 4 year old son and 11 year old daughter. We got the large cheddar cheese with a pretzel, focaccia/French bread, broccoli, cauliflower, and ham. For dessert, we got a medium milk chocolate with marshmallows, Rice Krispie treats, strawberries, and apples.

The good: My son says he loves this place \"as big as the sky.\" The chocolate \"fondue\" is delicious. Like really, really delicious. The fruit was really fresh and delicious as well. My kids and I all genuinely loved the dessert, even though my daughter didn't eat the chocolate. The large soft pretzel was hot,fresh, and really good as well. 

The not so good: The cheese was pretty bland. Like, almost tasteless. The bread was also a little stale, but super fresh bread would have been hard to work with. I think a better solution would be really crusty French bread. The veggies were raw, which was fine, but it would have been a lot better had they been very lightly steamed. The service was also pretty slow, but they were busy and it's a locally owned mom and pop place. We were in no hurry so it didn't impact my rating at all, but it's worth noting in case someone else is in a hurry.

I struggled with how to rate this place because I didn't really like the savory part, but I reeeeally loved the dessert. I also have to take into account that my 4 year old loved every part of it. My 11 year old was a bit indifferent, but she doesn't particularly like cheese and she hates chocolate, so I didn't really take her viewpoint into consideration. All in all, I think this place deserves a solid 4 if you have kids you are trying to please.  If I could separate the ratings, I'd give it a 2 for the savory part of the meal and a 5 for the sweet."}
{"text":"Loved it! A fun way to experience fondue for the whole family!! We will return. Friendly, local owners, too!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this was even considered to be,a good idea. Fondue is best when the cheese is kept warm and dippable. It is not supposed to be served in a Styrofoam cup. So disappointed, the cheese was cooling faster than we could dip, which made the dipping difficult. We trashed it and left. As this is a somewhat new diner and a new concept, perhaps a little guidance in ordering would have made sense. Instead the,young man just stood there not saying anything. Poor customer service, poor food quality. I won't be back. We wasted $24 we could have spent somewhere else. Good luck keeping this place open, you need to rethink the concept."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a friend and it was everything he said it was!!!  I went for no carbs and got veggies meat and cheese and it was great!! My wife got the dessert and loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I had never had fondue until I ordered for take out late one night. I called ten minutes until they were about to close and they stayed open just for me. It was such good food! The staff was super friendly.  I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Everything is yummy.  Great treat!!! We love the dark chocolate and salted caramel.  Tried the cheddar cheese tonight and it was great.  The hot pretzel and cheese is a must try.  Monday has a great deal to try more than one type.  If you are near the area, it is a must stop."}
{"text":"the fondue is wonderful and affordable!! Atmosphere is clean and very nice. Some of the workers seemed a little dry and un-personable. The menus could use some pictures and maybe somewhat of a facelift. Otherwise, it's a great place for friends and family to get a snack or dessert. Loved it! :)"}
{"text":"My kids love this place & beg to come here!! It's super fun to dip! There are so many choices!!! The milk chocolate is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I was given a groupon for the ELF, so we ordered a large cheese and small dessert. The food was a great value and the owners were really nice!!! We will come back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"We went for the first time last month and had no clue how the ordering worked.  Everyone there was very helpful and pointed us in the right direction of choices and how hungry we were.  We went for combo meals on both the cheeses and the chocolates.  Everything is delicious and fresh.  The desserts were amazing.  I'm glad it's close to the house as well.  They aren't stingy on to-go orders, either!"}
{"text":"We went in and had a dessert fondue option and it was great! It was a cheap option to all of the other places out there that are so much more. The chocolate was really good and all the dippings were fresh. The best part of it were the owners, they were very friendly and helpful, and even brought us out a bit of the white chocolate to give it a try. Has more of a frozen yogurt shop type atmosphere. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Fun concept and definitely different. The branding doesn't really tell you what to expect, but it's super casual and good for snacking. Not for a meal. They should definitely stick to the fresh fruit, veggies and desserts. All the meat was processed and pre-cooked, just not what you expect when you're getting \"fondue.\" Otherwise dessert was great, we had dark chocolate and all the fixings, would go back for that!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. We tried a little of everything. Both cheese fondues were really good! (If you ask, they will let you sample the cheddar.) The swiss is made fresh for every order. The cheddar is very mild, but flavorful, and the whole family loved it on everything.  The swiss was good on the bread and smoked ham, but over-powered the flavor of a lot of the other sides. (That's just my preference though.) The dipping sides were a far cry from being fresh made. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but were likely frozen and reheated in a microwave to serve. Veggies and french bread were fresh.

We ordered dark and milk chocolate fondue for dessert. The chocolate was much thinner and cooler than I expected it to be. It was difficult to dip and get it to your mouth without dripping. The dark chocolate was what I would have expected for milk chocolate; sweet and chocolatey. The milk chocolate was super sweet and my husband commented that it tasted more like caramel. (I personally did not care for it.) The \"in house\" rice krispy treats were yummy!! Strawberries and bananas were fresh.

Seating... this place is pretty tiny. There are only 4 tables. We ate early (around 4:30) and 3 of the 4 tables were occupied."}
{"text":"Great concept, delicious food and options, and the owners were very nice and helpful. I hope the success and great service continues!"}
{"text":"I really love this unique quick serve concept- choose your fondue, choose your dippers, voila!  I had the cheddar fondue and soft pretzel and white chocolate fondue with angel food- both delish, especially the white chocolate!  The fact that they use only Ghiradelli really makes a huge difference, and this is coming from a chocolate freak that at all times has multiple bags of Ghiradelli chocolate chips in my cabinet.  Next time I'm for sure going to try the swiss/ focaccia and the dark chocolate/ rice crispy treat combos. LOVE!"}
{"text":"I'd really like to see this place succeed because the owners are super helpful, kind, and energetic. The service was amazing and I really liked them.

Unfortunately, I thought the fondue was just so-so. The swiss was tasty, but the cheddar was bland. In my opinion, the cheeses were more like basic cheese dips than fondues. The chocolate fondue was tasty, but also very average, especially when compared to The Melting Pot or fondues I've made in my own home.

Cheese, chocolate, and an adequate number of dippers for both is about $12-$14 per person at ELF. Cheese, chocolate, and the dippers that come with the cheese and the chocolate at The Melting Pot is about $18 per person. ELF does have the advantage of being more family friendly though."}
{"text":"There isn't enough amazing things to say about this place! Since I lived in Switzerland, I have yet to find a great fondue place until I found this one! They really know what they are doing. The wife and husband are so amazingly sweet and very welcoming with a huge smile! I definitely would recommend this place to anyone! So many different choices it's unbelievable."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out because it is close to where I live.  However, everything tasted low quality to me.  The chicken reminded me of the chicken at Subway.  I was expecting tasty grilled chicken.  The pretzel bites were okay but the cheese was not.  I could of had better cheese out of a jar from the grocery store.  Also, the ordering process was kind of awkward because my girlfriend and I weren't sure if they were going to bring the food out or if we needed to go to the counter to pick it up.  Our order wasn't totally correct as well when we got it to the table."}
{"text":"No Adkins anti-carb folks here!  Bread, pretzel, veggies, Taquitos, etc. all dipped in cheddar cheese...yummy fresh goods.  If you're really famished for a substantive meal, this isn't your place, but otherwise it's a fun treat.  Fresh fruit, rice-Krispy treats, marshmallows & angel food cake all dipped in chocolate--delicious.  There's plenty of other variety to dip as well.  $27.59 with tax for 2 people. A little over-priced for what you get, but not too bad.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.

P.S. The brownies were spectacular!"}
{"text":"ELF Fondue is the place you need to be if you want great food and great service.  The chocolate and peanut butter fondue is the best I ever had.  It goes well with any dessert or fruit dipper.  One of the best Swiss and Cheddar fondue as well.  Nothing like melted cheese with fries, chicken nuggets and rolled tacos.  I will definitely be returning to E.L.F


We just had to come back again! This time brought the family visiting from Hawaii also.  Had to introduce them to the best Fondue we have ever had!"}
{"text":"I came here last weekend with all my kids and we had a yummy, unique lunch.  Again the customer service was top notch and the food was simply delicious.  I really adore this little place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The best fondue with good price. I can go there a lot and my kids enjoy too. Swiss fondue with focaccia bread the best one. And white chocolate mix with dark delicious.
Went today again and love it. Pretzel with chocolate or Swiss :-) make me smile. That is so good."}
{"text":"Wow! I would be the last to consider myself a fondue connoisseur, but I get a kick out of great service! This place rocks! We'll definitely be by more often. Thanks Bill!"}
{"text":"Our first visit last night....past bedtime with a toddler and newborn. Probably the best place to take a toddler- several finger food options and dip! What kid doesn't love that. 

We ordered the large cheese combo which was more than plenty for two adults and toddler. Finished it off with the small chocolate combo but def should have ordered the large...it was so good!!!

Highly recommend, will def be back. Very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This place is addicting! The first time we came we ordered the large cheese meal with cheddar cheese. I'm not a huge cheese fan but I liked it! My fiancé on the other hand LOVES cheese and he was in heaven! If you are ordering cheese make sure you order a fresh baked pretzel, it's a MUST!

Then, even though we were incredibly full we decided we couldn't leave without trying the dessert fondue. We ordered the peanut fondue with apples, Oreos and pound cake. I will note that the peanut fondue wasn't as sweet as I was expecting but with the sweet dippers it was delicious.

We have since come back and ordered the white chocolate and the peanut fondue mixed with chocolate fondue.

The white chocolate is really nice and it has almost a cinnamon taste to it.

The real winner here is the mixture of the peanut and the chocolate fondue. It is to die for!!!! You could really dip anything this and even eat it plain (which I will admit we did lol)

This is a lovely family owned place and they are super helpful when you come in. Do yourself a favor and try it! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I really did not know what to expect...  I was very pleasantly surprised .  The Swiss Cheese and Milk Chocolate Fondues were delicious!!  I ate till my tummy can't fit anymore"}
{"text":"When I first walked I was surprised how laid back it was. For a founde place I was thinking it was going to be fancy but I love the environment! 
My husband and I got a small chocolate mixed with peanut butter and Carmel founde! So good would recommend and getting every time!! Then got fruit rice crispy and a few others to dip it in! It is at an awesome price everything is fresh!
The owners are awesome! They are the nicest people they suggested we get the peanut butter in the chocolate and a few of their favorite things as well as the best sellers! They came around asking if we wanted water which was awesome as well! 
They even have punch cards so you know I will be a regular that will go there to fulfill my sweet tooth! 
Also want to add the chocolate is fancy I can't think of the name but so good!"}
{"text":"Can't say ANYTHING negative here.  Gonna sound like a paid advertisement!  Great, superior quality food.  Owners and staff are always friendly and attentive.  They work hard to change it up and always have one or two new options to keep it interesting.  Impeccably clean and fresh.  Oh, wait!  I can come up with two negatives!  Sorry, Bill and Celine.  1.  They are not open Sundays and close at 9.  We inevitably think about going at 845 at night or Sunday.  But, for their awesome effort they do deserve a day of rest.  Maybe soon they can expand to 10 pm?  And 2. The place is a bit small and at peak times seating is limited.  So I guess the moral there is - go early, go often!  Food is awesome, service is great, and pricing is fair."}
{"text":"We love this place , it is kid and family friendly. It is clean and the food is fun, and delish!

We went 3 times in one week the first time

You have to try the cream puffs and marshmellow treats homemade (They run out) due to demand. the milk chocolate has a  secret ingredient I will never make, but I still want to know. 

This is a little diamond more people should know about. I can see the regulars coming in,  and compared to  The melting pot  which is not kid friendly or  priced fairly. I would go back to the melting pot for a date night or  some special occasion for adults, but ELF is for everyone any time. We love it all  from Cheese to chocolate, pickles to  cream puffs We lick the bowls clean."}
{"text":"Awesome place! People are super friendly and eager to help discover new combinations of what you might like. Its a friendly home atmosphere without all the stuffiness of a major sitdown restaurant. I will definitely be coming back here as I just found my new favorite restaurant in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Cheese! Need I say more?? This place is awesome and you can't beat the value anywhere else that serves fondue. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. We had the Swiss cheese with focaccia and the white chocolate with bananas and brownies. I literally had a food-gasm when we started the white chocolate. The owner, Bill, let us try the peanut butter too and it was ta die for. I can't recommend this place enough!! We'll be back soon to try all the different flavors and dippers."}
{"text":"Fun place to visit, especially with kids.  Great food and even better service!"}
{"text":"I loved this place!  I took my kids here today. We had cheddar and milk chocolate fondue with all kinds of sweet and savory dippers. This is a unique concept and it's affordable and the people who run it are really friendly!  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Well,where to begin with this review? The only fondue place I've ever tried before was that one dark, overpriced place that I can't even remember the name of. Now, like most Americans I love cheesy and warm sweet treats and this place fulfilled my cravings for the day. My favorite was the pretzel & cheese, but don't get me wrong because the milk chocolate was BOMB! I like that the pretzel was warm, soft & the perfect companion for the cheese. The angel food cake was dellllcious and I had to fight my 1 year old kid for the last piece (I won). The prices are fair and the customer service was nothing to complain about. I'll definitely be back & I recommend this place if you have working taste buds (or even if you don't)."}
{"text":"First time in, I would have taken a picture of the food, but it was gone too fast!
It's a great mom & pop business.  The service was great too.  It was a great place to go with a group.  The prices were very reasonable and it's not a long drawn out meal like many other fondue restaurants.
Great place to grab a quick snack before a show or even a fun date night.

I almost forgot, check out their deal on Groupon too!"}
{"text":"We love this place! I always wanted to go but thought it would be too fancy for my kids, turns out it is very low key, down to earth. The prices where good, they had a large selection and the salted caramel dip was mmm mmm good."}
{"text":"Great customer service, yummy food, and ultimately a super fun way to make fondue fast and simple. The Rice Krispies treats with chocolate dipping sauce were outstanding."}
{"text":"This place is so good. We come here often. The customer service is always Great! Such a fun and different idea for dessert."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We were looking for a fun place the kids would enjoy. They loved the dessert!! My husband and I loved the cheese fondue, the ham, breads, pretzels etc were great! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their staff was really friendly, but the swiss fondue itself was not good at all. Real swiss fondue is thick and sticky cheese. The one here was watered down and had the texture of nacho cheese. Also, the bread portion for a large swiss fondue was not enough for the cheese itself. It is a rip off of the real experience with Swiss fondue! I've gone to Switzerland and experienced real swiss fondue several times to know the real deal. I appreciate the effort here, but it really does not fulfill the real Swiss fondue. I recommend going somewhere like the Melting Pot if you want to try something closer to swiss fondue. You won't find that here!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Casual fondue is such a great idea. I love the salted caramel. Peanut butter chocolate mix was sooo good with bananas. This is a fun place to eat, with a new take on fondue!! Would definitely recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"After seeing all the positive reviews we were excited to try ELF, but I can honestly say that after our experience everyone does not love fondue. Our first hint should have been recognizing the taquitos used in their platters as being the very same ones we see at Costco, but we went ahead and ordered cheddar and Swiss. Overall the cheese isn't terrible, but the dipping things they provide are of extremely low quality. If you're going to serve Costco food at moderate prices at least go through the effort of preparing it well. Instead we received microwaved food. 

In terms of portion size for three people two party platters left us still hungry. The service was pretty sub-par as well, we asked about what the woman at the counter would recommend for portion and she just said to read the menu and decide, super unhelpful. Do yourself a favor, skip ELF pay the premium for Melting Pot and actually enjoy the food you eat. Good concept, lacking in execution."}
{"text":"So this post originally started out as four stars, but I added the fifth because the owners of the place who took our order and served us were so great that they deserve their own star.  We came for my friend Michael's birthday dinner and were not disappointed.  It is a casual dining experience (think  Some Burros or Cane's) for fondue lovers.  The menu has a great variety for all tastes and dietary needs (unless of course you are lactose intolerant).  You can order Swiss or cheddar and pick the dippers you want.  They also have some great choices for dessert.  We ordered party platter style with both cheeses, some add ons and milk chocolate for dessert.  It was all delicious, but I especially enjoyed their garlic bread and corn dogs with the cheese and churro and cream puffs for dessert.  At around $15 per person with tip, I think it is a good deal.  For a fun foray into fondue I am definitely fond of ELF!"}
{"text":"Owners are amazing! Food is delicious, very family friendly. Can't beat the price for the amount of food you get!"}
{"text":"Delicious. You get a pretty good amount of dessert with the medium meal. I highly suggest going. Staff was friendly and helpful. Family friendly setting"}
{"text":"This place is a great place fun family time!! The food is good. Reason why I gave 4 cause service is a little slow.. The pound cake is amazing!! Very friendly owners!! Thanks for the nice evening!! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great food! We especially liked cauliflower in the Swiss cheese! The couple that owns the place is very friendly and made us feel at home. We will come back."}
