{"text":"Thank you Chefery for making life so easy and delicious. Ordering has been a breeze with Brian and he is always very accommodating when it comes to special requests and food allergies. We have used Chefery twice for lunch orders and Brian showed up on time, with all meals labeled with each guests' name. Our office is surrounded by restaurants, but we would much rather order from Chefery for all of our meetings. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering dinners from Chef Brian for several months & thoroughly enjoy his variety, and creativity on my limited list of foods. I've gone gluten free & Brian has tweaked his menu to fulfill my food requirements. He made quinoa loaded with vegetables. His salads are great & vegetables are very flavorful. He prepares tasty proteins, fish, chicken, beef & basically anything I ask for. He has an extensive menu of whole healthy foods and has helped me to stay on course &  lose weight. My friend also orders from Brian & loves the convenience of prepared meals after his late workout. I would recommend Cheffery to anyone interested in finely prepared meals delivered at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Chefery for a while now and finally understand what all the hype is about. My wife and I ordered nearly everything on the menu to eat throughout the week for lunch and there wasn't a single dish we wouldn't order again! Not only was each meal delicious, I actually spent less on my lunches overall for the week and ended up eating more whole and healthy foods!"}
{"text":"Not very many options out there in the Las Vegas area for great quality, chef prepared meals, for home delivery. They've got an eclectic menu that changes with the seasons, packaged with care... and instructions!  When I get burned-out from dining-out and don't feel like cooking for the week, Chefery is my go-to.  I highly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Just got my first delivery moments ago. I had to dive right into the beet salad. I am an uber fan of beet salads and always order them when they are on a menu. So, I know my beet salads. I loved Chefery's!  So fresh.  Usually you have to pick around a few questionable greens, not here. Everything in this salad had attention paid to it. I can't wait to try all the other items in my order. Beautifully packaged, with great/simple instruction for warming the entrees. Chefery will be on my weekly meal planning."}
