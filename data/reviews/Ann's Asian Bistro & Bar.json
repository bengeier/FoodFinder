{"text":"Came with friend from Sun city. Definitely worth a trip from anywhere. I've been coming to Phoenix for 4 yrs for school and compared to California the food was just blah, ok for a week, but nothing that I would want to come back to. This place is the opposite. The food is fresh and full of flavor. Amazing desserts as well. Silk Tea is to die for."}
{"text":"Finally found a good quality Asian restaurant in the Sun City area.  We have been searching for fried rice that had egg, sprouts and veggies in it and finally found it!  Ordered the pork fried rice and it was delicious and plentiful with veggies.  Entrees come with white rice and you can upgrade to fried rice for $1, but that side dish is plain rice, without eggs and veggies. Just an FYI.  Also had Mongolian Beef - good quality beef, sauce and fresh veggies.  Our son had the Orange Chicken - typical deep-fried but good quality chunks of chicken. The orange sauce was very similar to a sweet and sour sauce.  The prices are fair, quantities generous and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh food! Always look forward to it, and my kids constantly ask to go back."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews on Yelp, we tried this tonight as take out.  The calamari salad was excellent and very different.  We loved our vegetables with scallops.  We will definitely be back.  As good as it gets in the west valley and NOT a chain.  Hard to find something that is not a chain out here but to find one that is good, is wonderful."}
{"text":"We have eaten here a half a dozen times in the past six months and the service has been friendly, timely and attentive.  The food has always been good at dinner or lunch.  The lunch menu is real value with a tasty selection. We have taken friends here and they have also become repeat customers."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nice and the staff was very friendly.  The egg drop soup was the best I have ever tried.  We had the Mongolian beef and cashew and both were good.  Under $20 for lunch for two."}
{"text":"Lots of gluten free options. They are very willing to work with you to make what you want. They have gluten free sauce. I ordered shrimp fried rice very good. Very helpful annd nice waitor. Brown. Rice available."}
{"text":"We were in Sun City West February through April 2016, and went to this restaurant after a recommendation from a friend. We loved it and returned at least 6 times over the 3 months. The food is prepared by the couple who own the business, and each dish is made as it is ordered, accommodating any special request you might have (more bean sprouts, bigger carrot slices, etc.). No mass production sitting for hours. Staff are friendly and attentive. There is outdoor seating. The presentation is beautiful with different style plates for the wide variety of menu choices. We look forward to going back next year. Rita"}
{"text":"My wife and I love the Curry Curry! Best Asian Food in surprise! Negative feedback is garbage.  Bunch of whiners"}
{"text":"wow, what a delight to find such a nice restaurant as this. The food here is awesome fresh. Have never been dissipointed. Everybody I take there RAVES about this place. Yes, the service can be a bit slow sometimes. BUT do you want quick and bad? or a little longer and GREAT! I'll take the later. The husband and wife owners are there on premise to make sure your experince is the best it can be. Try the green tea Ice Cream. wow! Prices are very fair and and spot on. Portions are on the large side. You can dine out doors too. The setting is beautiful with a large outside fountain with the wonderful sounds of water. This is a hidden gem of a restaurant. I foresee this place getting much busier in the future."}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed at Ann's, and yet again delicious food delivered to my house hot and well made. House fried rice, Orange chicken,  spring rolls and Dan Dan noodles. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I give Ann's Asian Bistro a score of 4 for the food and a definite 5 for the service. So that is 4.5 stars overall which is not an option on yelp so I rounded up. The service stands out for numerous reasons.  First they offer a small egg roll appetizer with yelp check in which is always nice when a place does something. They are also extremely prompt with service from being attentive to take your order, water service before you need it, and taking finished dishes away. At one point we asked for more rice and they were happy to do so without charge (I kind of expect that but some places will charge you which I think is silly but thankfully not an issue here). On Mondays they even give you a free sangria with your entree which is a very nice touch. 
     They really care about service here and it shows. Things just kept getting better. Despite my husband's advice to order 4 Entrees, I decided to get 3 Entrees and split them among our party of 4. After we finished the 3 Entrees I decided I wanted another one and it was now near closing. The owner sent out a large bowl Chinese soup with vegetables and pork for the table to enjoy (On The House) while we wait for the additional food to be prepared. Fantastic Service!  It was my fault for not ordering it in the first place so they definitely went above and beyond!
    Additionally the atmosphere is nice and they also hold cooking classes occasionally (which I haven't tried) but it is an interesting feature. Finally, this is a small family business which I always feel is a good thing to support."}
{"text":"The food and service at Ann's is great, it just happens to be located in a ghost town! We enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. Hopefully the secret of Ann's will spread and help breathe some life into their little shopping center."}
{"text":"You guys were great! Came for Chinese Open Year with a party of eight. Service and food were fantastic. We ate it all until we were ready to bust. Keep up the deliciousness. So glad you have the authenic Chinese menu as well. We will be back for certain."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely come back!
Food and service were excellent!
A Jewel in Surprise and the Sun Cities"}
{"text":"Ehh its okey.. Food was not that great..
Curry curry chicken was gross & we returned it.. YUCK!!!!! 
This place is not good thats why it was dead when we went lol..

I WONT be back! 
I rather go to panda!"}
{"text":"My family had a wonderful experience at ANN's.  Food was delicious and authentic - I grew up in Asia and my family had restaurants; so I am qualified to say this.  Service was very friendly and warm.  The ambiance is very pleasant and relaxing.  They even have a diaper changing table in the restroom and a fountain area where active kids can expend some energy while waiting for the food to arrive - a family-friendly restaurant.  Unlike most Asian restaurants, the choice of beer, wine and spirits is extensive.  Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Honey chicken was crunchy and flavorful and the walnut shrimp was out of this world! Service was quick and friendly. Will definitely return when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Kung pao came without peanuts, was very mild (ordered spicy), and the meat was not cooked as I ordered it. Will not return here."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on a Friday night and we were seated right away. We started with the sampler platter appetizer (friend shrimp, egg rolls, chicken). There was a lot of unnecessary breading on the shrimp, but my husband liked the chicken.

 I ordered the Candied Walnut Shrimp and he ordered the Bistro Lo Mein. My shrimp had way too much shrimp on it but once I wiped some of it off the shrimp was pretty good. My husbands lo mein was delicious! We would definitely order that again. Overall we will be back but I will try something other than the Candied Walnut Shrimp."}
{"text":"Ann's has enjoyable, light, healthy Chinese food! They do happy hour 3-5 and 7-close with good drink options. The food and service are always great. We definitely will return."}
{"text":"Ehhh.  It was 5:15pm and we were the only people in the restaurant...for the entire time we were there.  Food was unimpressive.  We were excited about the dollar appetizers for happy hour which were good and the egg drop soup was very tasty, but the entrees were only ok.  The garlic noodles were weird with Parmesan cheese on them, and the happy family was way salty.  My dining partner had a glass of wine and for 5 dollars she got half of a small glass.  
Disappointing because we need good, not chain restaurants on the west side!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING the service is AMAZING and all at a great price. You can't beat the happy hour prices and the staff is very friendly. Need to come here more often, truly a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriends go-to spot when it comes to Chinese food. Their food is authentic and exploding with flavor that we can't find anywhere else. My favorites are the shredded potatoes, spicy salt and pepper pork, and the black pepper beef. The chefs remember us every time we come in, even if it's been months and they always cook out dishes exactly how we like them. The service is perfect, our drinks always stay filled. Jenny is a great server and always makes sure to make our experience a good one! You have to try this place. It's the best Chinese food you can find on the west side!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch a few weeks ago and were surprised at how good this place is.  I'm Chinese and from the Bay Area and really miss good Chinese restaurants, of which there are none in the Surprise area.  We went back for dinner a week later, and everything we ordered was very good.  We had the filet mignon, salt and pepper pork chops, and fresh green beans.  Next time we will ask them to add some hot peppers to the beans to give it added zing.  Portions are big, and we took some home.  We had very good service, and the staff was very friendly and attentive both times, despite having three large groups during dinner.  
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Steamed buns, soy sauce noodles, an egg dish no longer on the menu, couple of cheap cocktails, not bad.
Will be back for some of the Chef's Specials and Szechuan dishes."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness, we got up and left prior to any food being delivered. We (my 96 year-old dad and my sister) got up and left the restaurant after the party that arrived well after us was served their meal. We were there for close to an hour. So, they get a failing grade this time and we will not return."}
{"text":"This is a little bit of a drive for me but their food is so worth it. This is the 3rd time I've been here and haven't found a dish I didn't like. Their food is flavorful and cooked to perfection. Don't think my pics do them justice. The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Another disappointment in the valley. I was hoping the reviews on yelp helped but no success."}
{"text":"I have never eaten inside, I have only ordered delivery. When I have ordered, the people on the phone have always been polite and easy to understand. My order is delivered very quickly (we live in the homes just behind them so that helps) and is still hot. I get my orange chicken made spicy and its really good. I wish the fried rice had more egg chunks in it (it kind of lacks any real flavor) but there is really no room for complaint. They also swipe your card at your house with square. Personally, I like that better than giving my card # to someone over the phone who could be writing it down...."}
{"text":"Ugh! I should have read the other current reviews.  Mushy fried egg rolls (how does that happen?) noodles that were on the edge of being overcooked, a beverage that was more mix than what it was supposed to be and excruciatingly slow service.  Thanks but no thanks.  The ratings indicate this was once a really good restaurant, now it just needs a hug."}
{"text":"No comparison with other Asian restaurants.  Food is delicious, quality is first rate and servers are friendly and helpful in explaining the dishes.  We started with the Wor Wonton soup - yes!  Followed up with lettuce wraps - excellent!  Portions are large so we had no room for the entrée so took it home.  Cantonese chow mein was full of good quality meat and vegetables and the seasoning is out of this world!"}
{"text":"First, and probably only, visit. The service at best was indifferent. But, the food was horrible and largely inedible. To start with, the tea was served lukewarm in a pot which spilled all over the table. 

The Sliced BBQ pork was over cooked and covered with a sweet, brown sauce. We were expecting seeds and mustard for dipping; but, we could have moved on. The Magnolian Beef -- I hate to even think about it -- the meat was so mushy as to be nauseating.  I picked the vegetables, mostly onion, out and left the beef. The sweet and sour chicken was only slightly better.  

Poor quality meat being disguised by overly sweet sauces."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners.
Clean restaurant.
We tried the salt and pepper pork with jalapeños. Plenty for the two of us. (Comes with rice) Very good flavor and spice.
We also had the won ton soup. Excellent!
My husband said their Thai tea was the best he has tasted."}
{"text":"What a quaint little place.  Service was great and food even better.  My daughter and I shared crab puffs and potstickers for appetizers which we both enjoyed.  For our entrees we had Mongolian shrimp, Curry Singapore, and garlic noodles.  Spiciness was just right and all dishes had lots of flavor. They have several other dishes that sounded yummy, so I would definitely stop here again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"In the rush, rush of Phoenix and Surprise, Ann's Asian Bistro is a little oasis. Great food, great service and personable staff. 

Good place for kids too."}
{"text":"Thrilled to have found Ann's Asian Bistro & Bar!  Have had 4-5 meals there since they opened and each is better than the previous; and all have been excellent so they just keep raising the bar on themselves.  Until last night I've been enjoying their Cantonese style dishes.  Last night I savored -- repeat savored-- the Pad Thai.  While I'm accustomed to it being served with a lime wedge, Ann's used a lemon wedge and it was delightful.  The table service has always been good - very polite, attentive, calm. Food is served fresh and piping hot from the kitchen; presentation on the plate is superb.  Have had three desserts - green tea ice cream, crème brulee and tiramisu - all were perfectly portioned and excellent ways to finish excellent meals but my personal favorite, probably due to its uniqueness, was the green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for delicious Chinese food! Good sized portions and the vegetables are crispy! Prices are very reasonable! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was another bad experience. We order 3 dish
Tofu with fish pot , salty salty salty.
Seafood with crispy chowmein, taste ok but only shrimp and fish filet, I don't know what kind Cantonese restaurant they are!
String beans with garlic, it was disaster! Fiberly, under cooked! Good news was not salty!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Ann's! The service was exceptional, food delicious and plentiful, and the prices for the lunch specials can't be beat. We will be back , for sure!!"}
{"text":"Yuk, this place was terrible. It's right near our home, we ate there once with friends and will never be back. Bad service, price and food! 
Just horrible!!!! And no it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a delicious dinner @ Ann's Asian Bistro.  William greeting us and Yim was a great waitress.  Our dinner was served promptly with my wife, who is celiac, getting egg drop soup followed by Moo Goo Guy Pan... both GF.   My dinner was Won Ton soup and Shaken Beef which was superb!  The sangria was a great drink before dinner.  Can't say more about William and Ann over the years.   Authentic Chinese food and I've eaten in Hong Kong, so I know.  

Will definitely be back for more..."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Ann's for the first time.  We were pleasantly surprised at how flavorful the food was as it is hard to find a good Chinese restaurant in AZ when compared to Chicago where I grew up in the Chinese restaurant business.  I don't think there is a Chinese menu but the owner did come out to talk with us about the menu.  The place appeared clean and the ambiance and decor classy and contemporary (like a bistro) unlike most of the other Chinese restaurants here in the valley.  The servers were very attentive, friendly and polite.  I will certainly return as this is now my favorite place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"We visited Ann's last evening. The service was lacking. No greeter, and seating situation was confused. The servers seemed much more interested taking calls for to-go orders. Once we ordered, it took an inordinate amount of time to receive soup. Another server asked if we'd yet placed our order, we said we had, he then said ' Oh that must be your soup. It'll be just a minute to reheat it\". Needless to say this set the tone for the rest of the meal, which was merely average. Once we returned home, I had a MSG headache. Sorry to say. Not a go-back place for us."}
{"text":"We had take out I would not recommend, maybe dining in would be better tasting food. Food had flavour but was soggy (not fresh)"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous Cantonese style food and a terrific beer and wine selection. The pit-stickers are incredibly delicious and Bill was very friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Welcome to the West Valley Ann's Asian Bistro & Bar! We just went here the other night and we were very pleased with our dinner. The flavors were excellent in all three dishes and they were very large (plenty for lunch the next day). All of the dishes were plated very nicely and presented well. Their drink prices were also very affordable and they had a large selection! They seemed understaffed and perhaps needed more people working, but we went the night that an article had been in the paper about the restaurant being new and so I'm sure that they had some unexpected crowds. I'm thrilled that this restaurant is here, there is always room for improvement, but overall I'm definitely a fan and will keep going back! Yum! Thanks Ann's!"}
{"text":"New favorite place. Best Chinese food I've ever had. One of the best dining experienced in memory. Superb service. This place is going to blow up. Can't wait or return!"}
{"text":"The food is very good and they will make it the way you want, the service was fast and friendly the chef comes out to talk to the patrons, to hear comments please give the place a try they need more business."}
{"text":"Where should I start. Their food is truly authentic, with a very good menu to choose from. We were greeted at the door by Joanne. Very sweet and very knowledgeable on the menu. She asked what we liked and lead us both down the menu to exactly what we were looking for. Food is seriously on point, with a great experience as well. They have cooking classes every Saturday, that I look forward to attending."}
{"text":"Got to give this place a 5 star for food and service. Authentic cantonese dishes and reminds me of dishes i would have at home.  If you are looking for authentic cantonese dishes, give Ann's a try.

They close at 8pm tonight, must be New Year's eve."}
{"text":"By far... this is my favorite Asian Fusion place in Phoenix! Loved the variety options on the menu and the spacious restaurant which really is important to me because we had one member in wheelchair in our group . We were a group of 6 and every dish was delicious. Portions are large so come very hungry! The Hot & Sour Soup was the best I've ever had. They brought out a huge bowl that served all of us and we still had more left for seconds. Some of the dishes we had were: Pad Thai chicken, Orange Chicken, Mongolian Beef & Teriyaki Chicken. They were all so good. Service was great! Can't wait to come back again. Especially for the soup! XOXO"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times.  The food is just ok.  I had the cashew chicken tonite which was better than the orange chicken last time.  But nothing great.  Kind of expensive for a Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Eghh.  

Yeah there's food here. Yes it's edible.

I'm not going to say it's bad, but I just think I'm over this kinda American version on Asian food. 

It's got all the classics that fatty American likes but to me this just isn't a real departure to authentic Ethic experience. 

I mean c'mon.  Fortune Cookies were invented in California for Christ's Cross. 

You may like it. That, I'll leave for you to find out.


- P.S. 

William L. Of Ann's Bistro, 

That is exactly what I was looking for; dunno how my wife and I missed it, separate menu maybe?

But it sounds delicious. We'll absolutely be back for that. Thank you very much."}
{"text":"This cute little place opened where Picazzo's used to be on Bell Rd by the QT just a few weeks ago. It's definitely NOT 5 stars as given by S.B. but it's got potential. Surprise is DESPERATE for quality Asian food. Saigon Kitchen is great Vietnamese but we could really use a GOOD Chinese place and no...Pei Wei is NOT good Chinese. 

The service staff is VERY green, but they are very attentive, polite, and aim to please. The hostesses are adorable and enthusiastic, albeit very young, and very inexperienced BUT in a charming kind of way. Our server was very nice, very prompt, and apologetic for the newness of the restaurant and the kinks. (Suggestion-please don't have the hostesses dress like they are going to prom. It makes them seem even younger and more inexperienced than they already are) 

The atmosphere is very clean and professional looking but you wouldn't know you were walking in to an Asian restaurant at all. I guess because I KNOW this used to be Picazzos...but they didn't change the decor AT ALL. The patio tables could use some sort of covering on them. The metal mesh tables weren't great when Picazzos owned the place and they still aren't great now.  A table cloth would be nice...or something more substantial than the metal mesh. 

The food. I'll be kind and say it has potential. We had the chicken lettuce wraps and the sampler platter for an appetizer. The filling for the lettuce wraps was VERY plentiful but it lacked flavor. Even the sauce that they brought along with it, which I think was some sort of peanut sauce was very under-seasoned. The sampler had 2 of the following: egg rolls, crab puffs, wontons, chicken skewers, and fried shrimp. Everything was under-seasoned. There was no sauce for dipping either so that didn't help. 

Our entrees included Volcano Beef, Filet Mignon, Orange Zest Chicken and Mongolian chicken. These dishes were much better than the very underwhelming appetizers. While they were more flavorful than the apps, they were still very cautiously seasoned. All dishes come with white rice. If you want fried rice there is an additional $4 charge. They do not offer brown rice as an option. The menu is pretty common with most Cantonese style restaurants though so there is something for everyone. We liked each dish but hope that, with time, these will blossom into bolder seasoning and bigger flavor. Even adding salt would be a good start. And please don't under-season because of the Sun City crowd. They will be gone soon and you will need to cater to the people who live here year round. Trust me, we like SEASONED food. 

We concluded with dessert after getting our hopes up from the main dishes but to say dessert fell flat is an understatement. We ordered the dessert sampler which included mochi, fruit soup, and tiramisu. The tiramisu is obviously frozen and not house made nor was it made with ladyfingers. It was super dry on the lower layer bordering on stale. The fruit soup was basically fruit cocktail in a glass of milk. And there must have been some issue with the mochi because it took a good amount of time for us to get our dessert and our server brought out the tiramisu and fruit soup telling us the mochi would be out \"soon\". \"Soon\" was about 10 minutes later. Dessert was VERY disappointing. 

The portions were pretty generous although the sampler was kind of skimpy, only having 2 pieces of each item. Makes it hard for a party of 5 to really enjoy that offering but everything else was large enough for all of us to share and then some. The prices were pretty reasonable.

The biggest problem with Ann's Asian Bistro is that they are too conservative on flavor. They really need to amp it up if they are planning for the long-term. The service will work out its kinks and be fine but it won't be enough if the flavor isn't there. I am rooting for you Ann's Asian Bistro and I definitely will be back to check you out.  I really really would like to give you more stars next time! Good luck!"}
{"text":"Another great dinner tonight just 2 days since my first dining experience here, & equally as great! I took my two aunts who also really enjoyed the fresh & flavorful dishes. We all really love the snow pea sprouts sautéed in garlic. Bright green, fresh & clean tasting. Tonight we tried the clams in black bean & garlic sauce and they were delicious. It's such a treat to find a great restaurant in this area that is not a chain or franchise! Joanne the owner is a delight along with her family...just a warm & lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Okay, for those not appreciating true Chinese food, try Ann's!  They have expanded their menu and offered True Hong Kong food.   If you want to experience real Chinese by a real Family restaurant, try Ann's!   Try the deserts!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful first visit to Ann's Asian Bistro. Our first time here and the food and service was wonderful! This is a family owned restaurant and I loved the family atmosphere.  The owners kids were there and they talked to us, her son even sad with the regulars that were sitting behind us.  We will certainly be back!!!"}
{"text":"We tried the Volcano Beef and the Curry Curry with Chicken. Both dishes were made with Tender meats and fresh vegetables. Both were tasty and mild with seasonings and had a slight kick of heat. The portions were large and they were served on very nice plates. Brown rice is a $1. option.  We were entertained by the 151 rum flame in the volcano beef that continued to burn all through the meal till we spilled it all over the beef.

The dining room was clean and attractive.

The service was friendly and efficient.

Worth a try when you are in the area.

{"text":"I have been looking for a solid Chinese restaurant with lots of tofu options and I think I hit the jackpot with Ann's! My husband and I ordered the Egg Drop Soup, Crab Wontons, Kung Pao Tofu and Garlic Black Bean Tofu. It was all so good! There are several other dishes that we want to try as well. The service was great and the restaurant was comfortable and clean. I feel so lucky to have found Ann's! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BEST Chinese food around!  We have tried many Chinese restaurants around but we have been disappointed until we found Ann's. We have already been back several times after discovering it a few weeks ago.  The owners and staff are very friendly and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Disappointing. Stopped in for lunch recently with my sister and I ordered the chicken and broccoli and it was just lacking in flavor. I was looking forward to the egg drop soup which is one of my favorite things to order out, but theirs was just OK. Nothing memorable or really that savory. My sister had the chicken lo mein and it was slightly sweet and pretty greasy. She was not feeling well afterwards, so I'm not sure if it was from all the grease or maybe something was spoiled. It was also hot when we were dining which was uncomfortable. They had the door open which I'm assuming was to cool it down. Normally this would be nice however someone was smoking a few feet away, so the odor came right in. We will not be back."}
{"text":"My wifa and I ate at Ann's yesterday. Friendly place. Great Sweet and Sour Chicken The Bistro Lo Mein is fantastic. I'm a pot stickers fan and Ann's were excellent. Great raspberry ice tea. Service was just right."}
{"text":"This restaurant was amazing!!! Our server Brian was super!  He was so attentive and nice.  The food was piping hot and so much flavor.  This is our first time here and I am sorry we didnt find this place sooner.

The best General Tsos chicken i have ever had.  Very crispy, i asked for mild spice and it was perfectly spiced. 

My husband enjoyed his Orange Chicken and ate it all, usually he takes home his food but not this time.  One daughter had the Shrimp Lo Mein and it had tons of shrimp.  Other daughter had the Sweet and Sour Chicken and she loved it.  The mini eggrolls and potstickers were delightful as well.

Great service, hot food, nice flavors, good prices made us impressed and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout three times and they get it right each time. The best Asian food in Surprise! Love it."}
{"text":"Came here for a Mother's day lunch with the family. The place was pretty empty, so seated quickly with the help of the owner and his cute little son. Ordered two lunch specials (came with an eggroll, rice and a cup of soup) of Orange Chicken (crispy chicken tossed with tangy orange sauce) & House Chicken (lightly breaded chicken with brown sauce), XO tenderloin (cubed beef, onions and paprikas tossed in a mildly spicy house special XO sauce), Crispy Bone Sole Fish (deep fried lightly breaded whole sole fish with celery & mushroom in a white sauce topped with crispy Chinese kale leaves) and Braised Seafood Tofu. The owner was nice enough to give us all soups: egg drop and hot & sour soup. The soups and eggrolls were okay, but the other food was great and tasty. Unfortunately, the food didn't come out all at the same time. The owner gave a complimentary red velvet cupcake for Mother's day. 
I will certainly be back here to try other dishes as this place offers quite a variety of choices, both authentic Chinese and Chinese-American dishes. They also offer cooking classes of different dishes on different dates."}
{"text":"I don't give 5 star reviews very often, but Ann's deserves one from me. This was my first time in being highly recommended. I am pretty particular about my Asian restaurants having lived in Asia for some time but Ann's really exceeded my expectations.

I had the Garlic Noodles and asked for chicken to be added. Wasn't a problem (I've actually been to some Asian restaurants that said no substitutions!). The Garlic Noodles were fantastic and an ample portion for me to share with my girlfriend.

Also ordered Combo Fried Rice, Pot Stickers and Coconut Tapioca with Watermelon. Huge portion of fried rice and six pot stickers. Taste was perfect and were served nice and hot. The Coconut Tapioca was a fresh (no pun) way to put these tastes together and was just refreshing for a summer Phoenix evening. Sweet but you didn't feel as if you had to roll away from the table after a dessert. Loved it.

They've only been there 5 months and I can see they will be a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"Ann's continues to blow me away! I already left a five star review for them but I had to give them another review for the absolutely amazing experience I had with them today. The last time we came in we ordered our usual salt and pepper pork and shredded potatoes. The potatoes were cooked differently and not what we expected because we have gotten them there before and the texture and taste was a little off. At the end of our meal we asked our server if there was a different chef possibly in the kitchen that day but he wasn't too sure. We were happy to pay for the food anyways because it was still good, just not how it is usually cooked. This happened about a week ago. 

Today we came in and had a completely different server. We decided to skip out on the potatoes in fear that we wouldn't get the style we wanted again and did two orders of the salt and pepper pork instead (yes, it's that good). I kept telling my boyfriend how much I was craving our usual potatoes and considering whether or not we should just risk it. Half way through our meal the chef came out with a plate of perfectly cooked shredded potatoes and placed it on our table. He apologized and explained that his brother was the chef in the kitchen the day our potatoes were made differently which is why they tasted different. His brother came out and apologized as well and explained that he wasn't used to cooking them. I was in shock that they remembered that event and put the effort to fix the situation without me even mentioning it. I don't know how they remembered because like I said, completely different server. Our order is pretty unique so maybe every time they see it they know it's us. Either way I'm still speechless at how amazing their customer service is. They went above and beyond to make sure we left happy and continued to come back. We crave their food every day and the people who work there really make the whole experience the best you can get. Hopefully if the owner is reading this you can thank your entire staff for us! We look forward to our weekly visits with you!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we have the best authentic Chinese restaurant  here in surprise, we came  here on Sunday not very busy day but probably because not a lot of people have heard about this great restaurant, we ordered garlic bokchoy , sweet and sour pork/shrimp  seafood fried rice and everything is delicious, and served  in a large portion, We have tried Chinese restaurant  in the valley and this is one of the best. I felt like I was in NYC , we all know  NYC has one of the best Chinese food ."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here with a friend last night for the first time. Great food and friendly service! I had the Mongolian Beef and they added extra veggies for me. It was great! My friend had a special fried rice with shrimp and pork. We shared the two dishes and had some to take home. I'll definitely be back. They also offer cooking classes on Saturdays. Sounds like fun!!"}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable birthday dinner there sitting outside .They let us taste two Rieslings to see which we preferred . This speaks well for their service. I enjoyed the curry curry with shrimp. The Sauvignon blanc from New Zealand with its jalapeño flavor was an excellent pairing. We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 3 times already, but last weekend was the first with my kids so we decided to order family style (variety of dishes to share, accompanied by rice). We ordered the salt and pepper fried pork chop, beef chow fun, a fish and tofu clay pot dish, and mayonnaise shrimp. All were delicious and priced between $10-$13 for each dish. The portions were good enough for my family of 6. My kids gobbled up everything and loved it. The chef seasoned the dishes quite well. Now on to the service........it was great! We were there during dinner time and they were pretty busy. I think they got slammed by a big party or something before we walked in  and it slowed them down a bit. The food took awhile to come out so our waiter asked if we would like some soup. We got soup and the kids scarfed that down too. But when we received the bill, there was no charge for soup. Our waiter made our family dinner extra special that night."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food and service. Everything is always fresh and high quality. Can't beat the lunch specials and the portions are shareable. I havn't found anything that I don't like, I've tried."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and they have vegan options. Service was a little slow, but food more than made up for it. Will go again."}
{"text":"Unfriendly young waitress made me feel unwelcome. Dining alone is no fun, at least the waitress could make an effort to be pleasant. A server needs to practice appearing to have a good attitude as if they like serving you, even if they don't."}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly staff, wonderful food and great choices for wine!  I'm going back because they have an excellent menu with plenty of options available AND a flexible kitchen staff, which is hard to find in Surprise, aka Franchise Hell.  This time I had Curry Chicken but next time I'm having Volcano Steak or Braised Spicy Eggplant."}
{"text":"We hail from San Francisco and Ann's is the closest thing in the west valley we've found to \"home\" when it come's to Chinese food in the 13 years we've been here.  The hot and sour soup and the beef and broccoli stands up to any restaurant in SF Chinatown.  William the owner/chef is a delight.  Many times we'll call ahead to see if he's cooking before we go. He's got that special touch.  Nothing personal against those of you who don't care of Ann's food, but I think maybe you're experience with Chinese food may be limited????"}
{"text":"Arizona girl now...this place is good. There are not many chineese places in arizona and the ones there are expensive and not as authentic.....plus im a big fan of customer service and these were family owned and super nice food tasted great prices were awesome...A+ guys"}
{"text":"Went back to Ann's after trying other Chinese food in the area without satisfaction.  This time we received very good service and both of our main courses were excellent. My wife thought her egg drop soup was very good. My hot n sour soup was somewhat cold and bland but as stated, the main course made up for it."}
{"text":"Ann's Asian Bistro & Bar was a great discovery.  Enjoyed a wonderful lunch there today with friends.  We ordered from the lunch menu which offered a good variety of choices.  The food came to the table piping hot, flavorful & well prepared.  Courteous, friendly, attentive service. 
Happy to see a good quality Asian food restaurant in Surprise.
Yes we will return."}
{"text":"The sweet and sour soup is super duper!"}
{"text":"I've just finished my first take- out  at Anns Bistro.I am a total foodie and take flavor very seriously. I ordered the Moo Goo Gai Pan lunch special for around 11.00 including tax. Let me first tell you THE GOOD SIDE:the Staff was very friendly and prompt: food was ready in 10 minutes. My food was still warm by the time I got back to work to eat  approx 8 minutes away. My lunch included a small 4 oz cup of soup, FRIED RICE, EGG ROLL AND WANTON CHIP. I chose the Hot and Sour Soup. It was perfectly balanced with just enough vinegar(sour) and white pepper (heat)and I would compare it with some of the finest Chinese restaurants in the Valley. My stir fried vegetables and sauce were perfectly fresh and seasoned  to perfection,On the BAD SIDE...... there was a huge problem with the chicken. It was old chicken.  It was actually cooked perfect but I can taste a strong pungent after taste on my palate that I recognized as old chicken,not very pleasant in spite of the wonderful seasoning and sauces. Then the Fried Rice. One bite, DRY OLD and DRY. YUCK. Egg ROLL(2)they were ok nothing special: mini and Bite sized. SO I gave it 2 stars for the best soup and vegetable stir fry ever but Rice and Chicken ( which is pretty much a major portion of entrees) Not just bad but YUCK."}
{"text":"We love picking up Ann's and do it at least biweekly. Always ordering their orange chicken, plain lo mein, egg drop soup and either egg rolls or crab puffs. It is always quick, easy and affordable in addition to being absolutely delicious! No complaints and we are thankful to contribute to a family business!"}
{"text":"We decided to give Ann's another shot. We tried the general tso's chicken and the bistro lo mein. Both were delicious. I also ordered the sizzling rice soup but was not impressed.

I still feel that the prices are steep but I think that the food has improved."}
{"text":"Make sure to check your order if you get take out. Our order was wrong and there was no rice or utensils. Strange!"}
{"text":"Food presentation and quality is amazing! We got the cashew chicken and orange chicken dinner combo this time and it was delicious. Great price, very friendly server, yummy tasting Chinese food. Been here a few times and it's always been great service. They even deliver now so we will be using that option more frequently."}
{"text":"Awesome food
Fair price
Lots of food
Will come back again
Friendly server
Happy to have eaten here"}
{"text":"It was my daughter's 36th birthday so she selected Ann's Asian Bistro and we have been meaning to try but somehow never made it by. 
We were all pleasantly surprised...the food was really flavorful and the chef made a point of coming by the table after serving to be sure we were satisfied. The service was excellent and we all really enjoyed the atmosphere.  
We will be sure to stop stain and phone in for take-out.
Thank you for making her birthday memorable with your lovely singing. :-)"}
{"text":"We came here because we live across the street and really wanted to have some yummy food close by. 
We ordered crab puffs and spring rolls/egg rolls (depending on your menu), crab puffs were a huge disappointment not enough crab meat or cream cheese.  The spring roll was ok tasting but it didn't have a lot inside of it.  
There is no children's menu, I find that not to be family friendly, we ordered garlic noodles minus the mushrooms and sliced BBQ pork for my kids.  When the garlic noodles and BBQ pork came out it looked and smelled delicious, and they were both tasty.  BUT halfway through eating the garlic noodles my daughter noticed a DEAD fly in the noodles, yuck!  So they took the noodles and remade them but I was disappointed that they still charged us for the noodles.  
My husband and I split the orange shrimp which had way too much breading and tiny shrimp inside.  They also skimped on the orange sauce which I would loved to have more of.  
Overall disappointment...will not be back."}
{"text":"Highly rated restaurant. I was excited to eat here. Got orange chicken honey sesame chicken spring rolls crab puffs and hot and sour soup. All was meh. Soup was alright tho. Only problem is now I have $50 worth of food I don't want to eat. Bummer."}
{"text":"We had appetizers, they were delicious. Service was great and wow, awesome beer selection plus they have outdoor seating. NICE!"}
