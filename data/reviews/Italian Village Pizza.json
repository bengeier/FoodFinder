{"text":"One of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had.  Was charged .50 up front because I asked for ranch, but give it out for free if you ask after paying.  I brought it up to the cashier that they were deceiving customers and said it was her job to not disclose that to customers.  I asked for a refund and the manager was a huge jerk about refunding it and tried to argue with me that it costs money to buy the ranch. I obviously understand it's an expense, but they should charge everyone.  Manager told me to \"take a hike\" and threw my refund on the counter.  Shocked that a place with this terrible of customer service is still in business. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"best pittsburgh pizza, hands down. the special (2 slices & a soda for $4) is an unbeatable deal, and i like the pies we get for take-out, too. and the staff always make us laugh!  don't get me wrong - i love brick oven flatbread, topping-covered, yuppie pizza, too, but this is the real deal. NY-style, cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"Ive made multiple orders online just so there is no mix up with my order and they have now gave me the wrong order on multiple occasions.  They must hire illiterates because it is apparent that no one that works here, can read."}
{"text":"Ive have now made multiple orders online just so there is no mix up with what I order.  But, low and behold they have screwed up our order multiple times.  They must hire illiterates because it is apparent that no one that works here can read."}
{"text":"Chain options are around but for a good pizza order here!  Was so pleased with the flavor and that they supplied the plates and more then we need crushed red pepper.  The best part... Thank you for delivering to my hotel room and not making us come down to the lobby!!!"}
{"text":"Wings and gyros were awesome.  Service was excellent. Had a chance to meet the manager Steve Spicher. He was a great guy. Made us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Pizza is some of the best in PIttsburgh!  You can tell they use high quality ingredients.  The dough is the perfect combination of crispy, soft and chewy.  Rivals a pizza you would get in New York.  It's a really clean place with a fresh design and an incredible beer selection.  My wife and I often take a 15 minute ride when we don't want to cook dinner.  We have plenty of pizza places near us, but as good as this."}
{"text":"This location is much nicer than some of the other ones. The service is great and the pizza even tastes better. One of my favorite, quick pizza stops!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Love the giant slices. They always have a good special. Food is great and service is too."}
{"text":"The carnivore pizza is awesome also the pepperoni roll is really good I also like that lunch special great prices and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good pizza, hoagies, and appetizers. The drink specials are fantastic as well. They have a great assortment of beers on tap. The service is exceptional. They have gotten to know me to the point that as soon as I sit down they have my beer ready for me. I come here almost weekly with friends."}
{"text":"Got a circular for a menu in the mail saying they deliver within 5 mile radius. I live by the target which is only 2.5 miles. i called to order and the girl on the phone & the manager advised they don't deliver here & i received it in error. He told me they deliver to highland park. which is 3.6 miles instead of 2.5. I feel like this is racial profiling and should not be accepted."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always stop for the two slice special and wings. We love it!!!!!! And the workers are so nice to us!! Best new York style pizza around. Love love love!!!!"}
{"text":"This and Napoli are my fave in Pittsburgh. The slices at italian villiage in squirrel hill are gigantic. Great prices. Think NY style pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza! I recommend this pizza if you're in the area and are hungry for some pizza. The workers are nice, and there are some TVs that usually have sports on. You should definitely get around to trying this pizza!"}
{"text":"I was excited to get pizza here. I occasionally get pizza at the down town location, and it is very good. This pizza did not meet my expectations. First, you would not deliver the pizza to my house even though I live 2.1 miles from your location. I decide to go pick it up anyways. I was told 25 minutes and picked it up on time. The pizza was already ready when I arrive, and it was cold!  It seemed like the pizza had to have been sitting out and was not fresh. The box was not even warm. Whenever I pick up a pizza for another company, the box is so hot I can barely hold it. This pizza was under cooked and the toppings looked disgusting. Some of the pieces barely had any toppings at all.  This experience was very disappointing, and I will not return."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service!  I called at 11:45 am to order food that did not arrive until 1:15pm.  Incompetent management. If you are understaffed learn to set customer expectations. Had I been told I would wait 1 1/2 hours I could come pick it up or go elsewhere. I will be going to a competitor from now on!"}
{"text":"First off they have always told me twice as long as needed for my food. Anytime I get it something is soggy or cold. Also I ask for my hoagie to be crispy and it's always the same, lightly toasted. This is the worst Italian Villiage I have had. I also don't know why their sauce is more of an orange color compared to the others. Drive to Belle Vernon for good Italian Villiage. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I love that they finally got a fryer. Great deal on chicken tenders."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give no stars I would. Horrible service. Was given a time frame or 45-50min for delivery, after waiting an hour we called and was told food was on the way they sent the delivery guy out with 6 orders. After another 30min we called back and was told pizza was still there because they ran out of part of our order. They said they'd bring it right away. Waited another 20min we live about 1.5 miles away from the place still nothing. So we called back and asked for our money back. They never once apologized and every phone call they were trying to talk to another person about a whole different matter. And oh since we used a card it's going to be 3-4 days to see the refund. At least pay cash so when they don't show you know you won't be ripped off at least."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pizza in the Pittsburgh area. I love the lunch specials."}
{"text":"Food isn't horrible, just nothing to write home about.  You can do a lot better for pizza, wings, hoagies. Etc, especially with the amount of pizza places around Bethel Park."}
{"text":"I'v been coming here for about 6 months now pretty regularly. I always leave satisfied. Their Pepperoni rolls are honestly so good I have to get one every time! I just had a steak hoagie today for the 20th time and decided its time to write these guys a review.... MMmmAzing!!! i dunno what they do, but wow this is one delicious hoagie. thanks IVP squirrel hill, keep doing what your doing cause its def working!! Be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special.   My teenagers thought it was good, but I guess I had high hopes.  I did really like the crust, it was thin and crispy!  Didn't really have a lot of cheese or toppings, disappointed."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! Great service, quick delivery, pizza, wings, and pepperoni rolls are amazing!"}
{"text":"One of the good places for lunch at waterworks. Quick service for take-out. Also have tables and TV if you want to sit down and eat."}
{"text":"If you want terrible pizza go here. Save money go buy a frozen pizza and it will be better than this place"}
{"text":"This is a NY style pie, and even on a bad day, it's still a good slice of pizza. It's legitimately good, not just excellent in the context of the hot mess that is Pittsburgh pizza and trash like Mineo's and Aiello's. As far as Pittsburgh goes, it truly is as good as it gets, I'm proud to have this as my neighborhood slice shop."}
{"text":"I asked for toppings on their 'cheese only' special (2 slices + 16oz drink) and they literally just threw fresh green peppers on a pre-baked cheese slice and put it in an oven for awhile. I won't go there again."}
{"text":"Apparently they are incapable of making a pizza with no cheese and no sauce with just toppings?! I go to other ivps and they accommodate me...ohh well!"}
{"text":"Walked in and stood at the counter looking to get something quick.  Five minutes after standing there the girl behind the register looked at me while on her phone, rolled her eyes, then kept talking on the phone.  No service.  So I walked out.  Don't waste your time here..."}
{"text":"I got a pizza from here and it was downright awful. It was very dry and there was little to no sauce. The cheese almost tasted old as well. It might have been because it was on Saint Patty's Day, however the store did not look busy and I came to pick it up. I certainly would not consider this pizza place as there are many, many better options."}
{"text":"Standard New York style slices. I find myself coming here for lunch on occasion for their 2 slice/1 drink lunch special ($5.99). I neither crave their pizza or leave disappointed - but you definitely need to eat it fresh out of the oven.  They have a decent garden salad as well by avoid the balsamic dressing as it doesn't have a strong balsamic so it tastes mostly like oil.  I'd be interested to try their gyro or hoagies, but haven't to date. Staff isn't the friendliest bunch."}
{"text":"Excellent NJ/NYC Pizza! The best I've had in Pittsburgh! So glad I've found this place!"}
{"text":"Got 20 wings the other day and some fries. I asked for them extra crispy and they were extra crispy. Hot sauce wasn't too hot but the seasoned salt were certainly salty. Nice and crispy even after the commute in the take out containers. Fries were good and coated in some crunchy coating. Not the best Pizza Joint in Brentwood but they're always consistent."}
{"text":"The food is good but they go excessive on the cheese and to rebake cheese.... no! You can forget about having left overs because their food tastes bad after a day or two. The manager is a cocky little thing and will get smart with you. He confused me for someone else and he wasn't too friendly. They don't have a system that saves your address so you'll have to give them it every time you call. And they're delivery driver isn't too friendly, he claimed he called me and was outside but then said he called the wrong number, I went outside and the ass wasn't even there! But yeah... food's pretty decent lol"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, so so food but excellent prices. They always have great deals and a fun atmosphere for a pizza joint"}
{"text":"Very good, similar to how it was at Century III. I understand it's under new ownership, they seem to be doing a good job!"}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the New York White with pepperoni and the cannoli are very good. However, if you're ordering for delivery, expect a VERY long wait (even though I'm just up the hill from there). Occasional mix-ups but nothing to get upset over.  In general I do really enjoy the food. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice and a pepperoni roll. Both were delicious and service was great. The chubby kid behind the counter was very friendly. Definitely recommend this for anyone who wants some great pizza."}
{"text":"Don't count on them for delivery.  Restaurant was dirty too, in past visit.  Ordered from Italian Village Pizza at 2:40 pm on their website for delivery at 4:30 pm.  The weather is expected to be poor tonight, and I'm not feeling well, so I figured that I'd get my order in (about $50) to give them time to get it here.  Wow, was I wrong.  My son and I waited in our garage so the driver wouldn't have to negotiate our walk in the rain.  We waited for 20 minutes, so I checked on the status.  It was out for delivery at 5:10 pm per the status on the email link.  At 5:20, I called the store and the woman that answered said it would be there shortly.  At about 5:40 I called and she said that the driver is still out.   At 5:53, I ended up talking to a supervisor who offered me half off and said that the driver was in a neighborhood about 3 miles away.  I live about 1 1/2 miles from the store.  It's now 7:00.  I get that Fridays are busy.  I get that the weather is poor.  I'm a very understanding person.  I have an additional tip ready for the driver.  This is horrible service.  The woman that I talked to on the phone sounded high, and the supervisor just about yelled at me - yeah, I get that it's a stressful job.  Just tell me that you ain't going to deliver to my house, and I'll take my business somewhere else from the beginning.  I tried to put a comment on their website for feedback, but surprise!  The site isn't set up to receive feedback for this store.  Can't find a corporate contact anywhere.  Just hope that I don't get charged for this order.  Oh, and last time that I was in there, seemed like it's really gone down... was sticky, dirty, and the server also seemed high."}
{"text":"Great food. Staff is always nice. Pizza is amazing 100% amazing. (I'm very picky with my pizza)  Ive never had any kind of problem there."}
{"text":"Finally !! Found a great pizza place in our area :) This review comes after ordering in twice and it's been great both the times . The best part is how generous they are with the toppings . Ordered a veggie the first time around and then the supreme the 2nd time ( bacon, mushroom, spinach, sausage and chicken) and just see the picture to believe how generous they were !  The delivery has been good - the pizza did not turn cold by the time it got to us - so that's a positive even though this place is about 5 miles . Yes there is a delivery fee but then it's worth it . $17.99 for a large Pizza that is this good is worth every penny !"}
{"text":"I tried to place a delivery order, but the man who answered the phone seemed to have no knowledge of the area or the restaurant's menu. I provided an address and he needed me to spell it three times, then asked me how to find it. Then I ordered one of the specialty pizzas on the menu, and this guy didn't seem to know what it was, so he started asking me what was on this pizza. I read out the description on the menu to him, word for word, and he still didn't seem to know what I was talking about. Then he took my credit card number. Only then, after he'd spent ten minutes clarifying the order and getting my payment info, only THEN did he tell me that they don't deliver to my location. And then, instead of offering to see if any other locations deliver to my area, or offering to convert the order to a takeout (we would happily have driven to pick it up), he hung up on me. I guess they didn't really want to make a pizza for our money tonight. Went somewhere else instead, and I'll be monitoring my credit card statement to make sure nothing gets charged to it this weekend."}
{"text":"This place is a sad excuse of an Italian pizza shop. Order 45 mins before they shut down on a sat night and was given attitude . The place was dirty they where dirty and the pizza was horrible . It's sad because this had great pizza years back but that's you get when you franchise . Terrible food severed by kids that don't care at all!!!"}
{"text":"When I want a quick, thin crust, New York-style pizza with just cheese (and when I don't want to make a trip over to Jake's in Belle Vernon), this is my go to place.  I especially dig their two-slice lunch special for $4.95 - basically almost half a pizza and a fountain drink.  I'd rather get this for lunch than go to McDonald's down the street. Order it, they pop it in the oven for 5 minutes or less, and it's ready.  Everyone's really friendly too."}
{"text":"Decent quality, decent service. Some items are priced very high for what you receive (side orders) but the majority of items are priced fairly if you can take advantage of a coupon deal."}
{"text":"We've ordered many times from this shop. But this time was a huge mistake!! A 6 inch fish sandwich and 20 soggy fries for $15.98? With delivery charge and tip it was $21. And change!! Are you kidding me? Never again!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service.  The Panini's are incredible.  The hoagies taste better than from other pizzerias.  I'm getting the idea it's one of the only pizzerias in the area actually run by Italians."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty decent, on par with the other locations (century 3, McKnight road, etc.) My kid ate an entire slice. The toppings were a little too lean for my taste but I'd give this place another shot. I'm posting a pic too."}
{"text":"You know it's a bad sign when just the smell of the cheese makes you feel sick. Unfortunately, I had already entered in my order via campusfood.com... Boy, do I regret it. Not that I got the pizza (I ordered a chicken parm sandwich), but as expected, I could only swallow 2 bites before I threw the whole foot-long sandwich away.   It was soggy and tasted like rubber... and it's not just the sour milk smell of their cheese, but the fact that the pizzeria just seems dirty. I don't even want to know whether the guys behind the counter wash their hands after coming out of the bathroom (which I feel is unlikely)...  The guys who worked there were nice, but it just doesn't make up for the disgusting food that I had to throw out. What a waste of $..."}
{"text":"Your typical chain pizza place recently under new management. No complaints about the food slight above average pizza nothing to brag about. Main downfall is poor customer service. Most employees have a bad attitude and when they are busy are very rude and vocal about it. Overall there are better mom and pop pizza places around the corner and I have stopped ordering from them due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving two stars is because the food came out in a timely manner. Otherwise, this was our experience--  The salad was unwashed chunks of lettuce, with slimy veggies and crunchy dressing. Took two bites and stopped eating it. The other food was bland and disappointing.   It is just pre-frozen, over priced food and the service comes without a smile."}
{"text":"Recently I've started patronizing this business again along with some co-workers. The service here is much better and food is on point ..."}
{"text":"The pizza is very mediocre.  It is too doughy, but I do enjoy their sausage topping.  Their tap list is better than I thought it would be.  They had Duet on tap."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars for their delicious pizza. I haven't tried any of the other items on the menu and probably never will because I found what I was looking for, a nice big slice of NY pizza. My only complaint is that the tables and floor are always dirty. I don't usually eat there but it would be nice if the place looked cleaner."}
{"text":"Most of their food is really good. However I do not like there pizza at all. Their garlic knots are probably the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good for both eat-in and delivery! The restaurant is small but homey and the single slices are delicious as well as huge.. you can fold them in half. Super consistent. A slice is about $2 nowadays and fills me up perfectly. Delivery service is on-time and the pizza comes hot and crispy. Very convenient location. Staff is great and they definitely know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas and appetizers are good. I think the crust could use a little improvement - it has a bit of a cardboard taste and texture, not awful but not that great either. I do like their sauce which is a tiny dab sweet but not too much. Items ordered were well prepared and carefully packaged. Delivery takes about an hour during peak times but that is typical in this neighborhood. Person on the phone and the delivery person were courteous."}
{"text":"Pizza is great- and they have the best beer selection in town! My boyfriend and I happened upon this little joint after a movie at Waterworks and we couldnt have found more of a jem!   We sat at the bar and the bartender was so friendly and knowledgeable, we had a great experience, tried a lot of awesome beers-most of which you wouldn't be able to find at your local bars especially not on tap. They have a great selection of Dog Fish Head Beers and you can buy a 6 pack to take one. On top of their great selection we we're also really surprised with the prices. All the beers are very reasonable for being such high quality and they also have an awesome happy hour on Fridays which we look forward to taking advantage of in the future.  Def. recommend this place is you are a beer drinker!"}
{"text":"I think this was my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh, though that is more an indication of how few pizza places I like in Pittsburgh. It is dependable and decent; best eaten immediately as I think its taste declines unusually quickly in the refrigerator, which may be indicative of mediocre ingredients."}
{"text":"Sometimes you're just in the mood for eating something greasy, preferably with cheese.  Maybe you also feel like finishing it off with some liquid sugar, that is carbonated?  If so, look no further than Italian Village Pizza's amazing $5 and change deal which consists of two NY style cheese pizza (can add toppings for marginal fee) and a fountain drink.  The pizza is well cooked, is tasty and hot, with decent crust.  Add some banana peppers to that thing and you're rollin'.  Like I said, good but not special.  Great value.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"Good food with very nice guys waiting to serve.  I go in there with some frequency as lunch is cheap and quick. I find myself a bit of a pizza expert.   I actually like getting their slices more than a whole pie; why, I don't know. I have tried their traditional pizza as well as their square pizza. Both really good.   I have never gotten anything else there as I love pizza. But, all the other food I've seen looks good.  Give it a try and tell them I sent you!"}
{"text":"when i spoke to manager. because they wouldn't deliver to this person of colors house. Brad the manager said they can't come to this zip code because it's to far. I explained your menu says 5 miles and your restaurant have already delivered here before (we only live 3 miles away) all Brad could tell me was they shouldn't have .  it's obvious why this restaurant doesn't deliver to this house.  I will be telling everyone who will listen including on my social media pgs"}
{"text":"The food here is quite good.  Yes, the pizza is pretty standard, New York style, flexible thin stuff, but it is hot and very decent.  The spaghetti is very good and reasonably priced.  The salads are fresh and good-sized.  Given the price point, it's nearly 4-star food...  But this location is a little be greasy.  The surfaces of the tables, the seating, the floors, all have a bit of a sheen.  I know it's tough when cooking this type of food, but other restaurants seem to make their dining rooms a bit cleaner.  Not a show stopper, but it is a turn-off and seems it would be easy to address."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good, only good thing is the pepperoni rolls and they run out all the time. And they won't make them if you ask. Once they're out, they're out. Girl who checked us out was extremely rude. Wouldn't kill her to smile... Bad customer service skills. Seating outside is nice. Overall not impressed ."}
{"text":"Ordered a Buffalo Chicken Salad and half of the core and stem from the head of lettuce was in it. The manager told me that's the way it comes."}
{"text":"I like this please!!! Amazing food!!! They have  taken out and had delivery....  Friendly service and order was up in a timely... And  very hot!! I will recommend to all my friends The even has a lunch deals, two pizza slices and a drink for 5.50$"}
{"text":"Never again, called to get my order replaced and new pizza was not cooked in the middle."}
{"text":"I ate here today for lunch by myself.  This pizza place is located in a strip mall and I have walked by it many times not thinking too much of it.  Once inside the restaurant is much larger than you would think from the outside and looks much nicer than I had expected.  They have a large beer cooler in a front corner near their kitchen which is fronted by some cool brushed metal which is topped by granite.  There is lots of seating and it was amazingly clean whenever I was there.  For lunch I decided to get the special which was a 2 1 topping slices and a drink for $5.49.  I went with pepperoni and the slices were quite large as you would expect from a deal like this and I was impressed that two of them filled me up.  Both the sauce and the cheese on the pizza are not much to write home about although not bad either.  The real star of the pizza is the crust which was thin, crispy and mostly firm giving a nice little crunch with each bite.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here in the future again by lunch.  This place really caught me off guard in a good way from its cleanliness to the cheerfulness of the workers and even the taste of the food."}
{"text":"I agree with Michael F. Perhaps one of the few acceptable slices in SQ. Hill. For Pittsburgh Pizza it is very good! Real size slices are always nice!"}
{"text":"This is a descent pizza joint. It's modern with TVs and a party room.  The pizza is OK to good depending on the flavor. They do have extra seasonings to put on your food.   I tried the meatball sub which was good and meaty. Depends on what you order."}
{"text":"My dad loves the pizza from here and while it's not exactly my favorite it's pretty good. The crust is very bread like but it's not very greasy and the sauce is decent. My fathers taste is a little more bland than mine, but I'm sure if you add mor toppings than just cheese it would be great! I ordered the gyro salad and it was amazing, definitely my go to order at this place. All of the salads are on point and as always in Pittsburgh have French fries on them!"}
{"text":"\"Now Allison, is that anyway to eat a slice of pizza?\"  I asked my niece.  Imagine, she was about to use a knife and fork on a piece of thin crust!  What ARE parents teaching these young'uns nowadays?  \"Don't you know that's not the right way to do it?\"  I asked.   \"It's not?\"  My niece asked in reply.   \"No.  You have to take your slice, fold it over, and eat it with your hands thusly\".     \"Ohhh!\"  Allison said as she understood.   \"Now isn't it more fun to eat your pizza this way?\"  I asked.  Ah yes, so goes another aunt-niece bonding moment!  She asked me to take her over to the Carnegie Library and we thought we'd have a little lunch first.  Italian Village still has awesome pizza and the great thing is you can order by the slice.  They've also got a great deal--two slices of pizza and a 16oz pop for only $3.75.  So not only did we not have to schlep around half an eaten pizza, but Allison could order what she wanted.  She simply went for cheese and sausage. Me, I went for the spinach and ham.  Mmmm good pizza and good times!"}
{"text":"My husband is from NY, so he knows his pizza! We go here for their NY-style pizza. It's thin wide slices with a little sauce and cheese. We love it! When we're out and about on McKnight we'll come here often for a quick meal. It reminds us of our favorite pizza shop up in NY called Mia's.   Because we like the pizza so much, we haven't tried anything else they offer, but it's pretty standard pizza shop stuff."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of the only two acceptable pizzas I've eaten in Pittsburgh now. Pizza Sola in Oakland makes a slice of comparable, if slightly lower, quality. IVP has much more NY hole in the wall (smaller, grungier) charm. Easily beats out Mineo's.  One issue, when I've ordered delivery, especially in large batches, quality has sunk a ton. (Soggier crust, no burnt cheese on top.)I think it gains something from sitting out a while before being reheated."}
{"text":"Looking for a pizza delivery and too lazy to call, I opted to order the only option for my area on delivery.com, Italian Village. I ordered at 5:30pm and specified that I wanted the food to be delivered at 7:30. There were specific time constraints. That's why I ordered so early. Anyway, 7:30 roles around and no pizza. 7:35 . . 7:40 . . .finally I called. They told me delivery.com didn't send them the order until 7pm and they were finishing it up. I'm not sure I believe this but even if it were the truth, wouldn't that at least warrant a call to let me know it is going to be late? Why did I have to call and track them down? When the pizza finally arrived (after 8pm) it was luke warm and hard. The pepporoni was thrown on and barely cooked as if it were an after thought. The only redeeming part of the meal was the steak roll which was hot, cheesy and covered in that garlic parmesan deliciousness. They also added two $5 gift cards for being so late. Doubt I will use them."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and a great lunch special 2 cuts and a coke for 5 bucks"}
{"text":"Always quick delivery.  I left Pittsburgh for a few years and always craved their hoagies while I was away.  Too bad now they cut down on the amount of meat they include in them, so not exactly the same."}
{"text":"My husband said we got the worst pizza we ever ate there one night.  We tossed the soggy mess, and when i called back the next day the manager said i had waited too long to call and he wouldn't make it good"}
{"text":"i've never ordered pizza from them before, but based off of my CMU friend's recommendation, I came with him one night to try their 2 huge slices+drink for $3.75 deal (toppings cost 20 cents extra per slice). the slices are indeed huge, and in agreement with other reviews, these slices supposedly taste better when left out, like they do with their slices.  by reheating, their pizza comes out less soggy than the initial fresh bake.  i added on bacon to one of my slices, and they use legit bacon slices to top the slices! i was pleasantly surprised, as i inhaled the aroma from cheap but wonderful bacon.  if i wanted pizza, and was not too lazy to visit squirrel hill every once in a while, i'd definitely come here for a meal.  the portions are just right for me, and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Was totally surprised by this place. Menu with great selection. Service was quick. Seemed to have lots of drink specials. Had the garlic knots, really liked their marinara sauce. I also had the chicken \"Wedgie\", it was great. You get a lot of food for the price. Restaurant was pretty clean for the most part. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"God help me, I really like this pizza. They don't have any of the fancy toppings I love, and they're a chain. I mean, this place is a favorite for children, children! But I cannot help myself. I love this pizza.   The wings, on the other hand, are abysmal. There is possibly nothing grosser than wings with gelatinous skin. Fry them! No person, ever, wants to eat chicken with slimy, pale chicken skin."}
{"text":"I love the thin crust and Sicilian ones   I like when they use gloves to place toppings on pizza"}
{"text":"Visiting family in the Pittsburgh/South Park area for Christmas, ordered pizza delivery from this place twice.  The pizza was delivered on time;  it was greasy, salty, floppy, the cheese slid off the top, it was everything I was hoping for from a New York style pizza!  Awesome 5 stars.  Then again, you can't get any decent New York style pizza where I live (silicon valley/west coast) and I have been craving a good slice for a very very long time... so my review rating is probably overrated.  Not many Yelp users around here so I thought I would help out."}
{"text":"Italian Village Pizza is a safe pizza choice in Pittsburgh.  I brought my brother here a few weeks ago because he is picky as can be.  Pizza is always safe with him.  Also, Italian Village had the standard NYC deal of 2 slices and a soda so my heart warmed over a bit.  This is going to sound bizarre, but order this pizza and go home.  Put it in the refrigerator and ignore it for twenty four hours.  Then reheat it and eat it.  This pizza is way better the second time around!  It was a bit greasy for my taste the first time, but I liked it much more after reheating it.  Also, stick to standard toppings.  I preferred the cheese slice the most.  The green pepper was eh.  My brother and I wanted breadsticks or some other appetizer, but they were out.  So instead we got cheesy garlic bread.  The cheesy garlic bread was packed with cheese and garlic, and it was delicious.  We washed this all down with some raspberry iced tea.  We both wanted dessert.  I ordered a cannoli ($2.25), but they were out of chocolate chip cookies, which the brother wanted.  Between being out of breadsticks and most cookies at 4:00 PM on a Sunday, this was a bit of a detriment to the trip.  The cannoli was definitely not homemade but decent.  Overall, 4 slices of pizza, two drinks, cheesy garlic bread, and the cannoli were $15.65 total.  I thought this was a good deal."}
{"text":"On the pricey side for Pittsburgh pizza delivery but worth it, in my opinion. Crust is crispy but not super thin. The buffalo chicken pizza is my favorite, second only to the pepperoni rolls. Order early or those won't be available, they're amazing and sell out quick!"}
{"text":"Called ahead to order at 6pm. 1 pizza, 1 order of wings. They quoted me 25-30 mins. Showed up at 6:35 and I watch them put my pizza in the oven. Wings are done and sitting there getting cold. Unimpressed.   Pizza usually tastes good at least."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas in Pittsburgh.  The crust is always crunchy and fresh.  They don't overdue the cheese.  It is also never greasy like some places can be.  They also have some of the best house made ranch I have ever had.  It goes great with just about anything you can order.  On top of their delicious pizza they also have great hoagies and wings.  Their Italian hoagies is one of the best around.  For their wings I usually just go with the mild.  They are always crisp and have a great buffalo flavor.   The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for here."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the cheapness of those who run the place have forever ruined me. I called to order a large pizza that they have advertised on their website for $9.99. I was told I was wrong and that they would give me a medium for that price. Even after pointing out their error they seemed reluctant to honor the advertise price. I have purchased pizza there in the past that had been advertised in their flyers at a special price. When I've ordered the pizza they charged a higher price because I didn't specifically ask for the special price. It seems to me their only concern is trying to squeeze every last penny out of you. I will take my business elsewhere and I will spend my money at an establishment that values customer loyalty."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places we have eaten at.. Good job,, they truly a 5 stair restaurant.."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza joint.  They had a good coupon deal for wings, a pizza, and a hoagie, and everything we got was tasty.  The \"spicy\" Italian hoagie was not spicy in the least, but large and very generous in meat, and very good. The wings we got were mild but actually more spicy than the hoagie. The pizza was pretty good, too."}
{"text":"After an early flight and chaos at the airport, this was our first dining spot when coming back to Pittsburgh. My fiancé told us to meet him there. From the looks of the place, I was hesitant to dine in, but then again usually run down spots that are holes in the walls are pretty good. Right? He ordered pizza and bread sticks. The marinara sauce was the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5. It reminded me of cheap canned tomato sauce. The pizza however, won me over. Fresh from the oven, very hot and delightful. The sausage had enough spice. Abundant amount of topping and the dough was nice and crispy! Everything was very flavorful and delicious. 3 slices later, I was in a food coma! Will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely down right discussing. The greece and oil seeped through the paper plate.  The cheese was jewel and they gave me a whopping 5 pieces of pepperoni. Stay away!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the area for 10 years and have never ordered pizza from Italian Village. I didn't know what I was missing. This pizza was really good. Haven't had a pizza this good in a while and I'm glad I gave them a shot. I got the large Village Supreme. You pick 5 toppings. I got pepperoni, sausage, green peppers, mushrooms and garlic. Good crumbled sausage, crisp green peppers. Nice flavor to the sauce. Delivery was super fast. They estimated 45 to an hour. Only took 20."}
{"text":"We go there about once a week. Their steak and mushroom hoagie is fantastic! The pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Pizza was undercooked. How hard is it to make sure the cheese is melted, dough is golden brown and toppings slightly crisped. For the price, won't order again."}
{"text":"As far as greasy pizza goes from squirrel hill, ivp has always been a secret major contender. They have had the $4 special (two HUGE slices with a drink) since I was a kid. Their crust is thin with a crunch and a perfect amount of cheese.   It is a small place with a row of small tables. It is a little on the dirty side and always has been. They are also one of the places that refused to hire women for a very long time, which annoyed me. But none of these things have been enough to steer me away from that special! Their take out pizza pies are also pretty cheap. They accept cash and card, unlike some of the other places around. One of my go-to places for a snack."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but they need to update their  website says they open at 1030. Called 3  times to place an Order at 11 and no answer then called back at 1115 and they couldn't deliver for over 1 hr."}
{"text":"Stopped into Italian Village Pizza today to give them a retry. It has been sometime since I have eaten their food and wanted to see if they raised their standards since my last encounter (moons ago).  Walking in, the joint appears to be clean (even behind the counter). The staff were friendly even though they were all very busy getting ready for the day.  I ordered a medium sausage pie to go, which took around 25 minutes.  The pizza is a standard New York style thin crust. Although they do offer other styles, this is the type I selected. The pizza is good, nothing to write home about, but good. I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place. They are always very accommodating with my food allergies and the sauce is delicious. I won't go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Just finished a white pizza with tomato, great light oil. No overpowering garlic that stays with you all night! Reasonably priced family pizza night. Service is great, delivery hot and quick. Either red or white sauce, you can't go wrong with this neighborhood shop."}
{"text":"Ditto what Darren said. Blech. Either my tastes have bettered or all the IVP's suck aside from the one in Baldwin/Pleasant Hills (?). Bad, bad pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is the best, great cheese, great crust. We will definitely be back for more! If we could we would give it more stars!"}
{"text":"After a long day at work, my sister and I decided to go home, order a pizza, and try to relax. We put in a call to the closest pizza place we could find, in the hope that it would arrive somewhat quickly. We were quoted an hour wait, but decided to go for it. An hour and a half later, our pizza finally arrived, and we hungrily dug in, only to discover that there was no sauce on it. Now, it is quite probable that it was not intended to have sauce, but if that was the case, it seems only fair that there should have been a warning on the menu description, since one orders a pizza expecting that it should indeed contain sauce. At this point, we were so hungry that the only solution we had was old barbecue sauce - which, by the way, was a horrible combination. So, although technically the pizza saved us from starvation, it was pretty disappointing in the taste department. In the interest of fairness, I could give a more accurate review if I tried a pizza that actually had sauce on it, but for now, I'll probably try other places when in desperate circumstances."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the North Hills area ( Besides Center Ave Slice) It's a tie... lol.. We get the NY style which is HUGE and thin thin thin with the freshest cheese and toppings... Their homemade garlic knots are TO DIE FOR.. Their ranch kicks butt also. Can't say enough of this pizza place!  MMMMM...."}
{"text":"This Italian Village location is good. It's totally fine. It's not as good as the one in Dravosburg however. That one is amazing. Anthony knows is shit.   But they're good here too. The two slices deal and pop for $4.20 is pretty spectacular though!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza here!  Had the white pizza and it was fantastic.   Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a white pizza tonight from the Waterworks location. It is one of the best white pizzas around. I have had the sausage pizza from them before, which was good, but the white is much better."}
{"text":"This joint is recently under new management, so we decided to give it another try tonight, and I am pleased that we did. We ordered pickup and the food was done by the time I arrived at the estimated pickup time - no waiting around!! Brought home a calzone, pizza, and garlic knots. Everything was super tasty, good quality ingredients, piping hot. Great value for what we paid. Definitely our new favorite pizza joint in Munhall!!"}
{"text":"I've ate In and I've taken out and had delivery...every experience was the same.  Friendly service and order was up in a timely manner...even delivery was awesome...and still hot! I'd definitely recommend the pizza the most from this place. Takes me back to my days growinv up and the food court at Century III mall"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings from here with delivery.  The pizza was pretty decent but the wings were just so-so.    The prices were pretty good and delivery was quick.  I'll definitely order pizza from here again."}
{"text":"This place is a wet, dirty diaper. The dirty food matches its dirty neighborhood.  Their slow drivers on Oxy can't figure directions from a mile away. When delivered, their pizza was lukewarm and tasted what I assume was old lady's socks. This food will give raccoons nightmares. Perfect food to give to an enemy or gf you are breaking up with."}
{"text":"We love the grilled buffalo chicken salads ...AMAZING!!!  The Sicilian pizza is delicious too love the crust."}
{"text":"The outside of this establishment is unremarkable, but the pizza and wings are the best we have had north of the river. The cheesesteak pizza was delicious, three of us barely couldn't finish an XL. We ordered the sweet devil wings and honey habanero, they were both good, but the honey habanero were amazing! The beer selection is top-notch, both on draft (I had a draft Dogfish Head IPA) and bottled. The place was busy, and our server was young but capable."}
{"text":"This is our #1 go to pizza around us, and even though they don't deliver to us, we make the drive! I usually get the ranch lover's pizza because who doesn't love cheese, bacon, and ranch ON PIZZA?! Their pizza is always fresh and hot. I'm a huge crust fan and I approve of IVP's! Their wings are pretty delicious, too. I guess what I'm trying to get at is there's really no going wrong here!"}
{"text":"They have the best pizza. Closest to New York style as you can get. The garlic knots were good. Not overly garlicky. I ordered online and it said it was through Grub Hub but when the guy delivered he was from Italian Village and typically they only deliver in a 5 mile radius. I was 7.5 but they delivered anyway. Made my day."}
{"text":"I get pizza delivery from these guys a couple times a week.   Pdg za.   They cook it well done and it tastes good."}
{"text":"Extremely slow delivery. Rude person yelled at me when I called to inquire about my order placed nearly 2hrs earlier ... Finally got the Pizza and the slip said it was made an hour and a half before getting to me so it was ice cold. Ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I always receive great service, amazing Bbq wings, fresh salads and my favorite waiter Chris is there. Stop by this cute place before a movie, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"As a delivery driver, I am always looking for a good cheap place to eat. IVP never let's me down. Great slices, many great locations etc etc etc"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, short wait during prime lunch hour, and the pizza was delicious (extra REAL cheese was amazing). Extra points for having diet Mountain Dew!  Numerous TVs to watch while you eat, this would be a cool place to take in a game while having some of the best pizza we've had in Pittsburgh so far. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a couple times now and it's pedestrian pizza at best.  Low cost and quality ingredients and it isn't even as cheap as the big chains.  Canned mushrooms are not acceptable in the largest mushroom producing state in the United States.  If you are too lazy to provide fresh ones then I will not return.  Typical of Pittsburgh area cuisine, not enough seasoning or care.  Try Harry's Pizza a mile or so South on Washington or Grande in the same neighborhood.  Both are much better."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch time pizza shops . Food tasted good and service  is really fast and prices are great!"}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch, a bit busy but no different than in the past. Ordered two slices, pepperoni and sausage as well as a slice of spinach and tomato.   Quickly arrived at my table piping hot, too hot to eat which is a good thing! Service is fine for what it is.  The restaurant is very clean and organized and the pizza is fine for a small chain pizzeria. I like it.   The staff hustles and works quickly to clear tables and keep them open during lunch so there is always a place to sit when you stop in, however they do get a nice lunch crowd. What's unfortunate is there aren't many IVP's left in the South Hills. Fortunately this one is still open and busy!"}
{"text":"My favorite item is the tuna salad sub. Always good either hot or cold. Prices aren't any more expensive than any other local pizza place. Delivery is always prompt and I have yet to receive cold food."}
{"text":"Last 3 times we had ordered from Italian Village, the pizza has been sticky and not cooked. My husband got sick in the stomach for 2 days last time we ordered a pepperoni Pizza. The pepperoni was very spicy, the Pizza wasn't cooked enough and it looked like the dough was old. That was the last time we ordered from Italian Village. Someone recommend  me \"La casa del sole\" in Aspinwall. We now order from \"La Casa del sole\", it is less expensive and very very good."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings and most importantly cheap beer.  If you're in a rush and want quality pizza or sandwiches, go to Italian Village.  Casa Del Sol is my favorite delivery pizza in the Blawnox, Sharpsburgh, Fox chapel, Aspinwall, and Ohara area but they're take out only.  Italian village has very good Nyc style thin pizza and inexpensive beer!  Slices are 1.99 and domestic beer is cheap."}
{"text":"My last review feels like it was about a different place! I have given them a few more chances (because like I mentioned in my earlier review, the food is so good), and it seems like they've pulled it together. The most recent meal I ordered was a 2 slice + a fountain drink combo. The pizza is delicious New York style pizza. It's the perfect thinness to sauce to cheese ratio. I know ratios involve two things, but you know what, it's pizza and it's delicious, it can have three."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and was ready right when they said it would be. I'll definitely be visiting again since I work so close. Definitely recommend them for a quick lunch stop!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza...prompt delivery...and, they can handle a large order for a party."}
{"text":"I ordered the Steak & Cheese specialty pizza and an order of fried zucchini.   The pizza is described as having \"tender steak, grilled green peppers, mushrooms & onions on a bed of melted mozzarella and cheddar cheeses\". What arrived were a couple skimpy shreds of overcooked meat swimming in a flat lake of cheese. Not a single veggie or mushroom on the entire pie. Not as advertised, and a total ripoff for the \"specialty pizza\" price.   The zucchini was waaaaay overcooked. They were a deep dark brown with burnt black patches. Edible, but barely."}
{"text":"Decent pizza at a bit of a mark-up. It's convenient, they deliver, and they take credit cards. Their subs are decent. Their wings are meh. Their pizza is vaguely New York style, which is good.   Their delivery needs work. They send these poor guys on multiple trips in the snow, and they don't use any insulating bags, so their delivery pies are invariably ice cold and need a shot in the oven."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!   This place is amazing!!!  I ordered a calzone and it's larger than my head. The garlic is pouring out of it and the texture is perfect!  I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try Gali's Gyros which is a mile or so down the road. They're closed on Sundays. Meh.  The way I see it, one can never have too much pizza. So to Italian Village we went.   They appear to be a chain. They're all over the South Hills and beyond!  They're even in...Paducah, Kentucky???  And Italy???  Luckily there's one not too far from us in the West Mifflin/Pleasant Hills/Baldwin area. We passed at least two others in the general vicinity on our Sunday cruise.   Yeah, no wonder yinz don't come aht here 'n 'at. It's confusin'.   So anyway, we stopped in on this muggy, storm-looming afternoon to get a BBQ Chicken Pizza, something I haven't had in a while.   The BBQ sauce is a sweet tooth's dream, and a diabetic's nightmare. Wilford Brimley would not approve, pointin' and shoutin' \"DIABEETUS!\" at ya while your incisors and canines sink into the pizza's moderately slim, slightly crunchy crust and that fatty, gummy mozzarella makes like Brie, oozing all over your plate and tongue. The chicken was moist and tender, not drying out in the least after being baked.   Culinary erotica.   I got a half an Italian hoagie also, and it was a fine, fine example of a hero, grinder, whatever you want to label it. They were somewhat stingy with the meat, but the bread was adeptly baked, the veggies crispy, the cheese good and lardy, and the dressing packed a tangy wallop. This was easily one of the best hoagies I've ever had.   The may be a chain, but they make their food like an indy. Horns up."}
{"text":"Eh, IVP ain't no MVP, that's fer sure. Damn, was the pizza was pitifully tough, its sauce barely noticeable, its cheese redeeming it somewhat.   The meatball sandwich was a Maid-Rite gone wrong, which should tell you something about the quality of the meatballs themselves. Somebody just smashed 'em up in that sopping, sobbing bun made even more terrible by a creepin' terrah of a marinara.  The delivery was on time, though.  What garbage I subject myself to for Yelp."}
{"text":"Had a coupon so why not try IVP pizza.  It is a local chain, but they do a good job.  Staff was friendly and made sure we were attended to.  The pizza is hand-tossed style and good.  They do have deep dish sicilian pizza but did not tried.  Wings were very tasty, spicy but not to hot."}
{"text":"Fastest delivery I've ever had! Great greasy cheese thin crust and calzones, garlic knots were good but nothing great. Made with real fresh ingredients and delivered hot. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give the Italian Villagr a try. The service was very fast and friendly. I ordered two slices of sicilian too go. They were ok nothing special to speak of. If I was in the area and was in the mood for pizza I would give them another chance but would try a different kind of pizza."}
{"text":"Great little pizza place.  Slices were large.  Soda machine was self-serve, allowing for free refills.  There was a ton of variety of slices.  Overall, a quick, cheap, good bite."}
{"text":"This rating is strictly based on a pick up order of hot wings. The service was fast, the price was fair and the wings were very above average for a chain pizza place. I live about 200 yards away do I imagine I hit this up regularly."}
{"text":"Italian Village Pizza is a good option for anyone shopping at the Waterworks. You can grab a quick meal or chill with a slice and a beer, while watching some sports on TV. They have a great full menu and beer selection, as well as pretty much anything NY style pizza by the slice. The service was fast; and, our bill was very reasonable for lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop here for lunch one day around 1:30 on a Tuesday. It wasn't crowded out all and the lady behind the counter was friendly and offered us menus.   Typical pizza place menu: salads, hoagies, calzones, Stromboli, whole pizzas or by the slice, apps (garlic knots, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, etc), and BEER.   Comfortable seating with a selection of booths, tables, and bar like seating right in the front window of the restaurant to people watch everyone walking by on the sidewalk.   I ordered two slices of the tomato and ricotta pizza. My husband got an order of the hot mango habanero wings, and half a steak/mushroom hoagie. He also got the Dogfish 90 minute IPA. The lady behind the counter brought that to our table. Our number was called after about 15 minutes and we got our food.   The pizza was good. Really light and minimal ingredients. Crunchy crust which is different from what I like, but it was tasty. The wings were good. My husband likes them more than I do and he approved of them. Not too hot. Now the hoagie... let me tell you. It had me rethinking my slices of pizza as soon as my man brought it to the table. The bread was perfectly toasted on the outside and had a soft middle. The steak and mushrooms lay on top lettuce and tomato. The cheese was melty and mixed in perfectly with the meat. Of course I made him share with me :)   Overall it was a good experience. My only complaint is that I wasn't for sure what to get, but now I definitely know. That hoagie was great. We will probably go back!"}
{"text":"I like coming here. I usually dine in with my boyfriend, and the employees pretty much know our order by heart. Never had anything bad here...the breadsticks are tasty, and so is the village roll (our regular). Good friendly service"}
{"text":"So good! Simple, fast, good food! They have a huge variety of items in addition to pizza. Salads, chicken fingers, fries, hoagies, stromboli, etc,.   Plus they have online ordering!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery they did wrong order and charged for side sauce ranch  and never brought it I called the store the staff was awful and they told me they will bring the ranch if I want wtf I want ranch for if the pizza is fup and it takes you another hour to deliver it"}
{"text":"I used to hate this place because I ordered the round pizza and it is really bad-like cardboard-no cheese, no sauce, nothing. But I tried the square pizza and its really pretty good-but it will add pounds."}
{"text":"Love this place. Nice staff, friendly. Pizza is delicious. I have never been here but will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful but mistakes are often made. We order there quite a bit and it's almost never specifically what we ordered. We keep ordering though, as I said the food is really good."}
{"text":"Italian Village is a growing chain and with good reason.  In Pittsburgh they make the closest to a traditional NY style good pizza, on their good days. I have eaten at many of the Italian Villages in the Pittsburgh region and I would rank this one in about the middle of all of them.  The best Italian Village in the city may be the McKnight Rd location.  The worst would definitely be the Hazlewood location (where a dirty pill junkie of an employee actually lit up his cigarette in the middle of the filthy shop while taking a phone order).  Unfortunately it is really hard to make consistent good pizza the right way and this Mt. Lebanon location is a good example of a shop lacking in consistency.   Usually when I order from here they cook the pizzas directly on the brick but every once in a while you will get a pie that was cooked on a screen and it tastes like wet butt.  In their defense, I have sent some wet butt pies back to them and they were happy to replace it and were very apologetic about it...but its always a hassle to have to do that.  I will try to judge them on their better pies here because I do think that they really do try hard to make a good product but its hard to find good help in Pittsburgh.  (On a side note, Pittsburgh needs more Mexicans...they are like God's gift to pizza shop owners.  I would have 300 unemployed yinzers homeless under a bridge for the sake of good pizza, survival of the fittest! )  When made well the pizzas are perfectly round and the cheese is distributed well across the whole pie, the crust is perfectly puffed on the outside all around.  The sauce is distributed very lightly but evenly across the whole pie.  If you get a good pie from them it will be pretty close to perfectly made.   When the pies are cooked directly on the brick the crust is pretty dang good.  It has a bit of a nice tough chewiness to it and the edges are crispy.  The taste of the dough isn't too salty or sweet, it has a nice medium bready taste which is unoffensive and at times quite tasty.  This Mt. Lebanon location specifically does that thing where they brush garlic butter onto the crust, which is pretty stupid and gross and does not taste good.  Its a shame because they actually have a pretty good tasting crust too, I don't know why they feel the need to \"pimp it out\" like its their 1995 Dodge Neon.  If you ask for them not to do that they are happy to oblige.  The crust is usually on the thinner side but still thick enough to support everything.  If they let the dough ferment a bit longer it would probably taste pretty awesome and I have had pies from there that were exceptionally good tasting its just not totally consistent.     The sauce is safe but good, unfortunately they do not put very much on the pie and what they do put on is fairly watered down.  Garlic is the main player in the sauce with slight accents of spice and herbs, the tomatoes seem to be of decent quality.  I think some parmesan may be in the mix too.  If this sauce wasn't as watered down and there were some chunks of tomato than I think it would be excellent but as it stands its still not bad and I actually think it may be better than most other sauces in the city.     They go a little bit heavy on the cheese for how thin the pie is but it's not too bad usually.  It is applied evenly across the pie.  They are claiming that they are a 100% Grande cheese shop but you can tell from the taste and consistency of the cheese that it is definitely not all Grande.  It doesn't have the super salty taste of all Grande or the gummyness.  I am thinking they are using half Grande and half cheaper, there may be some provolone involved too.  The cheese is kind of a letdown for me, if it were more flavorful it would really do a lot for the whole taste of the pie.    In general this shop is trying really hard to offer a NY style pizza to the people on Pittsburgh for a decent price but they are using the traditional cheap-ass pizzeria tricks (watered sauce, blended cheese) to do it.  I still recommend giving them a try though because in a city full of blind pizza the one eyed pie is king.   6 out of 10"}
{"text":"They should be ashamed. The pizza barley had cheese on it and the service was lack luster at best. I keep going back to the place because I see staff keeps changing and I hope someone will care about doing a good job, but to date that has yet to happen. I'd take the time to comment to corporate but they don't seem to care much either. I'll try to post a pic in \"checking in\" so you can see what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Love the thin pizza slices and milkshakes, friendly people.  Stopped by a year ago for first time, have not ate pizza anywhere else since."}
{"text":"Great pizza ,hoagies and wings. Staff are super nice and helpful. The place is clean and I frequent here a lot .Good bottled beer selection, enough of the dogfish head though, there are so many others out there that I'm bored with them. Draft list is always solid but I'd like to see more balance of ipa vs browns or stouts. I tell people to eat here all the time. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Ive been eating this pizza most of my life, but never really had a \"fresh\" pie, just re heated slices while i was out shopping or something. I kept it simple with a large plain and an order of wings. First thing i noticed was the cheese was lacking, even on a light sauce request. Though its a good blend, i feel it could be a bit better and a bit more. Sauce is nice. But for me , it's all about that crust! Very nice, the way it soaks up the oil. The wings were pretty big and meaty, but they should double the cook time, i dont mind the wait. Overall i always enjoyed this place, usually friendly staff and quick service"}
{"text":"Ok, tasted better than vocelli and cost less.  Plus, how can you NOT love a place that has a \"ranch lover's\" special.  It came with two cups of ranch!  i do love ranch!  The delivery did take a while, but it was friday night and I can wait for my ranchstravaganza, that just gives me more appetite to down more ranch-dunked slices!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for beer and pizza.  They have a great beer selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff and awesome pizza.  They make pizza by the slice for you while you down a beer or two after work.  This is one of my favorite places for pizza if you are North of Pittsburgh."}
