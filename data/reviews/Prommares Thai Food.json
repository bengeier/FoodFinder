{"text":"I've lived in DC and Chicago, two great food towns.  There is no Thai place in either town that compares to this one. Tofu pad Thai makes being vegetarian worth it and picking your spicy level (1-10, 6 for me) is awesome. Authentic food for suThe lunch special is cheaper than Panda and a million times better. The service is not perky but that's part of the charm. Very small seating area and not much to look at, but get past that because you will love it! This will always be on my Vegas to do list when I return."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the food.  We stopped for lunch while driving North through Las Vagas and we loved it soo much we stopped again on our return trip.

Better than anything in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Super good taste. Really Thai. We love it. I truly recommend u for Thai. U get definitely local Thai food here."}
{"text":"I was in the area and found this little family owned thai restaurant. Made a to go order and I was just treated as I was just dining in. They were so friendly and the service was so fast. Not to mention their basil fried rice was AMAZING! I had many basil fried rice before but this one was the best! I highly recommend this place. Food and service are absolutely 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Food is always totally delicious, and service is excellent.  It's run by a really nice woman- I sadly don't know her name- who calls everyone \"honey\".  Super fast service as well.  It used to be very plain and cafeteria-like inside, but has been redecorated and is now colorful and elegant, with drapes, bookcases, buddha statues, etc.  Don't let the fact that it's in a strip mall fool you.  Do be careful, as the spiciness levels can vary.  A \"3\" could be not spicy enough one day, then too hot the next.  Beware the papaya salad!  Prices also very reasonable, about 7 bucks for a dinner entree.

And, when you've finished your meal, if you have room you can just walk across the parking lot to Big Dog's for a homebrewed IPA.  Ah, this is the life.

Edit- This is the best Thai place in town.  Better than Lotus because you never have to wait for a table and you get more personal service.  Also, they have the BEST Pad Si Ew I have ever tasted.  The only drawback is no alcohol, but like I mentioned you can go to Big Dog's afterwards."}
{"text":"Good food and cheap .i like the pad thai seafood and tom khar it the best i never try before ."}
{"text":"Great, fresh Thai food!  Pad thai and pad see-ew are both delicious.  I had their chicken pad woon sen a couple of years ago and didn't really like it, but I'm so glad I tried it again recently because it is amazing now!  They're definitely generous with the spice in a good way, so I might order down from what you are used to at another Thai restaurant.  We will definitely be back when we get a craving for Thai take out :)"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai I have ever had. Great service, convenient location, nice atmosphere. Definitely make sure you go here if you are in Vegas, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"I love this place.!  We come here a couple of times a month. The carrot salad and beef larb are great appetizers and the yellow curry, drunken noodles and spicy fried rice are my favorite entrées. The recipes are all family recipes.  The lady who owns the place is great to talk to about Thailand if you're interested.  

It's a small place but worth the trip. This place and Komol are my favorite 2 Thai places in Vegas. I always bring anyone who comes to visit in town to this place if they want a good Thai restaurant. Safe part of town for out of towners wondering."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last eleven years!  It's a small local business with the owner that's always there greeting all her guests and serving up some hot and fresh Thai food that's made to order!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Intimate and clean, with the best Pad Thai in Vegas.    Great place for lunch, and it's family owned and operated.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The food here does not meet our expecation for Thai food. Their BBQ chicken smell so bad, the worst BBQ Thai chicken I have eaten. The place is very small, and service is so so. Not recommend for anyone!"}
{"text":"chicken curry was awesome spicy # 5

Tom Ka Gai  was a little minty
 Would definitely be coming  back."}
{"text":"We ordered chicken satay with peanut sauce and chicken flat noodles with bean sprout and tofu. They taste delicious ! The servings are good enough for two. This place is a gem  and I am  coming back ."}
{"text":"Best Thai in town! Staff is super cool, service is awesome and food is amazing. Can't ask for better!"}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai ever!! Smoky and tasty Pad Thai , it reminds me of old school authentic Pad Thai in Bangkok, Also their Thai Tea is just perfect touch, not sweet,not too plain, it gets along with Pad Thai like a love couple."}
{"text":"Find a good Thai Restaruant? I suggest this place if you are near the Charleston Campus.

Great Thai yellow curry!"}
{"text":"owners and workers are so kind. food is fantastic and thai is my favorite, so I've tried out many places here in Vegas. red curry or panang chicken excellent. when you order hot, you get hot which is how I love it! reasonably priced as well. you won't be disappointed, try it out!"}
{"text":"Love the feeling of traveling to somewhere different and experiencing a new culture delicious food also"}
{"text":"nice friendly service. average chinese/thai style food. Thai food is so much better than this."}
{"text":"The food was great, but after a couple of months they served us unfresh meat.  I ordered chicken panang curry, the meat was hard to chew and completely tasteless like the chicken was re-use or recycled. Never went there again."}
{"text":"Tried this place because of the reviews I found here on Yelp and I wasn't disappointed.  This tiny little place is right behind \"Big Dogs\" on Sahara.  The owner was our server also, she was very friendly.  The appetizer, dinner and desert were great, we've found a new favorite that we will definitely be returning to."}
{"text":"Take it from someone who has been to Thailand, cooks Thai food, & married to one; this place was a big disappointment.  Their Tom Yum soup is a disgrace, their food is mediocre, definitely isn't worth more than 2 stars & it's a bit overpriced.  Staff are friendly but slow. They tend to forget their customers, after we got our food.  Would not come back to eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in Las Vegas the food is excellent and the service is outstanding we have been visiting this restaurant for over 5 years everytime we come to Vegas we make sure we come over here to eat I am from LA"}
{"text":"By far the best Thai Food I have ever had.  I go here almost every week for a \"Mint Basil Chicken Spicy Level 5.\"  I also get a huge pot of rice to go with it.  The prices are perfect and you will get more for your money."}
{"text":"Prommares is THE best Thai I have ever eaten.  The owner (Nari) and her family have ruined it for me, because I now compare every Thai restaurant to hers.  The service anywhere else, does not compare... and the food is amazing.  

Go enough and you'll be treated like family.

Definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is a small, hole-in-the-wall type place that I would have never gone to or even found on my own. The food is good and the staff is friendly. I had the pad see ew and tried some of the pad thai, both of which were quite good. The portion size is pretty large, so it's good for a meal and a snack later. It's close to me, so if I ever want Thai food in the future, I'll probably go here."}
{"text":"The hubby and I are a big fan of Prommares Thai Food.  We head over there every week to have my #13 Chicken Pad Thai and his Coconut chicken, veggie and rice.  As soon as you walk in the door you can tell this place has it's on Thai atmosphere which is refreshing from the plain restaurants that have just a table, chairs and menus.  When having lunch here you are served depending on the day either vegetable soup or salad, your order and fortune cookies to end the meal all at a great price.  The persons that work there are super friendly and professional.  You get that kind family feel especially from the owner she is always so welcoming and attentive.  I work for CBS Radio and my position can be stressful at times and to come here and relax once a week is like a treat.  If you haven't experienced Thai food I recommend going to Prommares on Sahara Ave."}
{"text":"Best thai food in town. It is a hole in the wall for sure, but the food is great. We usually get the pad thai, yellow chicken curry, pad woon sen or pad kee mao. The service is a little slow, but it is family owned."}
{"text":"Love this place! They are so nice and their tea is the bomb.com I love spicy food and I was amazed that you could choose how spicy your food is. I donno to mee it is just heavennnn."}
{"text":"I ordered the Panang Curry for lunch recently.  It was good but I have had better.  I ordered it five stars for spicy and it was still rather mild for me.  It's still a good friendly little place."}
{"text":"Nice, quiet place. The service was great, took our order immediately and took good care of us. Food was also great, and best part they let you choose the spiciness level. Would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the top places on my list for Thai takeout. Unlike a certain popular competitor that I won't name, Prommares has such a home-style feel to it, like I'm sitting at a friend's grandmother's home eating their homemade cooking.

The restaurant is very much a hole in the wall with limited seating. I've heard that it can get filled up to capacity but in my experience, I've never seen it with more than 5 customers at a time. I believe the owner is the lady who works the front and she might sometimes seem abrupt, but I swear she's actually really nice, just a no nonsense type of person. 

I've ordered takeout several times and it's never taken more than 10 minutes for them to cook my food, lunch or dinner time. Their yellow curry and chicken with chili and cashew nut are delicious with just the right amount of spice. Their fried rice is also very flavorful with the basil and spices. The only item I don't really like is their pad thai, which I found the noodles to be really dry. At first I thought it was just me, but after reading other reviews, I'm not alone. Also, charging $2 for a box of rice is a ripoff, but the prices are really decent for the portions and quality you get, so I just make sure I cook rice at home beforehand."}
{"text":"The best authentic family own place I've ever been to. If you know your Thai food and know what to order. You got to come here. I'm Thai myself and this place taste just the way my family be making this ! BOMB ASF."}
{"text":"The food was really good!  Great spice!  

Really enjoyed the meal!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place! 
Service is always good and food is like mom's thai comfort food.
Great place for lunch too!"}
{"text":"Every time my fRiend and I have gone here it has been quite good.  We usually would take lunch at her lunch hour, which is 11.  This is about the time they open up.  This means we were the first to be served whatever they had (read: fresh) and without much of a wait.

The food here is fairly good, comparable to many of the other thai restaurants in town.  I am addicted to Tom Ka Gai soup and they have an excellent soup here that I almost could have without ordering anything else.

I do not like that they serve soda in cans.  However, the overall price of most items here including drinks is very affordable.  It is a very small restaurant so I wouldn't recommend much more than bringing a few people here.  

Hrmm...think I'm going there for lunch...writing this is making me crave..."}
{"text":"Got the pork fried rice and pad woon sen (glass noodles) with level 8 spice.  Mmm mmm except for the fact that the noodles came in a smaller portion along with white rice when before it used to be just a heap of noodles.  4 stars cause they became stingy.  Tch tch for shame!

Oh and don't listen to the 1 star reviewer guy, street vendors in Bangkok serve amazing food soI don't know what point he was trying to make.  It also doesn't help that he mentioned Archi's after talking about Bangkok, since that place is the Panda Express of Thai food."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best Thai food in the valley! I have yet to have a bad meal here (occasionally too spicy, but that's not really a complaint). The service is fast & friendly, the prices are very reasonable. Whenever I crave Thai, this is my default restaurant of choice!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant! Small place but excellent food and friendly service.  Pick up orders have always been ready when promised."}
{"text":"The food was good but the larb was not good..however when I told the waitress about the problem she took it off the bill. I say try the place because you will not be dissappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't tried a huge amount of Thai food to be completely honest, so I guess my palate isn't as refined as some others when it comes to Thai. I went to high school right down the street from this place, and I swear there was another Thai place that used to be on the corner or maybe it was this one and I just forgot. No clue. Anyhow, this place is tiny and a hole in the wall. That being said, those types of restaurants usually have the best food. So we sit down and we had a very sweet woman waiting on us, that reminded me of a little Thai momma. She called everyone in the restaurant honey and was too cute. We ordered the iced Thai tea, which is coconut milk added to tea. It was different, but pretty good. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was fantastic. I got a 5  from a scale of 1-10 because of the warning that 7 was too spicy. I added some chili paste anyway, and it was great. Like I said, my palate is not too refined in Thai cuisine but the food was fresh, it was fast and delicious. Our little Thai momma was super sweet, gave us great service, and I would 100% go back. I would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic Thai and a great, modest dining experience."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to get curry!

I get the chicken curry, with the crab rangoon wontons as an appetizer. The portion is very nice, and the people that work here are too. Great customer service combined with fantastic flavors is what makes me come back here every time. 

I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Prommares is the second of two Thai restaurants I decided to revisit after having my appetite for Thai food stimulated by reading a discussion in the Talk forum.

I went to Prommares with the same friend as I had taken to Basil 'n Lime.  Here we ordered an appetizer because the cost was so reasonable -- 5 veggie egg rolls served with sweet & sour sauce for only $3.99.

I knew that rice was a separate charge here, so I was prepared to order it with our entrees, but I didn't have to.  After we placed our orders, our waitress added \"a pot of rice\" to the order for us, and it turned out to be a generous pot of rice.

I ordered the same entree here that I ordered at Basil 'n Lime, Chicken Panang -- which is my favorite Thai dish.  The waitresses at both restaurants asked me how spicy I wanted the Panang on a scale from 1 to 10, and at both places I chose 5.  

Here, at Prommares, I thought the Panang was a little better.  It was less sweet and a little spicier and richer with flavor.  Very delicious.

My friend ordered a spicy chicken and eggplant dish at a 10 on the spiciness scale.  I had a bite of hers and loved the flavors.  She definitely enjoyed it.

As others have pointed out, Prommares is a little hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  It's located in the same strip mall with the Good Will store.  The interior is quite small with just a few tables.  The unisex restroom  was clean, but you have to walk through the back of the kitchen to get to it, and the toilet seat doesn't stay up on its own.

I think the location and the small size are a con; however they are probably responsible for another pro, which is the very good prices.  Our bill here came to $22 and change, only two bucks more than we paid at Basil 'n Lime, where we didn't order an appetizer.  So if you minus the four dollar appetizer, our bill would have been two bucks less at Prommares, even though we had to pay two bucks for rice.  Seen in that light, I don't mind in the least being charged separately for the rice.  It's just a different way of doing things and their prices come out better anyway.  

So overall, I give Prommares a small edge in taste and price, while I give Basil 'n Lime an edge in location and atmosphere.  I will definitely return to Prommares as well."}
{"text":"This place defines HOLE-IN-THE-WALL: A small, worn down, unpretentious restaurant -- very quaint, a tad dingy, not fancy or expensive... you're definitely not there for the atmosphere, ambiance, decor or service... but you definitely get quality Thai cuisine! Sometimes you just have to take a chance on the sketchy looking places!

ORDERED:
- SHRIMP PAD THAI (lunch special)

Good amount of noodles, plentiful large shrimp -- no complaints from me at all! My coworker's say this is their Thai food go-to, and now I know exactly why! ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am not very familiar with Thai food, but G.I. Jane was with me so she helped me order. I ordered the bean sprouts with tofu and I was in heaven. The tofu was just right and the bean sprouts were tender but still had a bit of firmness. The cucumber salad was amazing and the waitress made me laugh when she told me that the recipe was more or less secret. I tried my boyfriend's chicken curry and it made me want to melt it was so good.

This is an awesome family restaurant, so be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai Chicken and Shrimp is my favorite. I'd love to add the beef, but theirs is not soft and hard to chew. If you're not much of a spicy person, I'd suggest just Level 1 (out of 10) of spiciness. I don't know if they really measure it coz sometimes it's so spicy it feels like level 4. But they have the best pad thai in Vegas so far."}
{"text":"Prommares Thai Food is awesome! Just a totally unassuming hole-in-the-wall type place in a shopping center that is putting out some great tasting, authentic food. Price/portion are very reasonable. Good for take-out or dining in. The decor here is a little strange yet charming. It sort of reminds you of being in your Thai grandmother's living room, very homey. 

Service is good and friendly. They don't serve any alcohol so plan accordingly. Just order some thai iced tea...awesome! Everything we have ordered has been great. A fav. would have to be Pineapple rice. If you want something spicy, be sure to order more stars than you normally do! 

Overall it's very delicious and one of our favorite spots in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Found this little gem last week.  Let me tell you you won't be disappointed.  Our sweet hostess/owner/waitress Nari, made us feel almost like family.  We started with sissy shrimp and the Tom KhaKai soup.  Great flavors and prepared with care.  Entrees were Pad See Eiw beef, Chinese broccoli / chicken, Pad Kee Mao chicken and Thai fried rice / chicken.  You are asked to select a heat range of 1-10.  Our server recommended 3 for the Thai fried rice and it had a very nice hum. I can't imagine the heat of 5 or more!  All the dishes were nicely prepared, flavorful, smartly and simply garnished and not oily in the least.  We look forward to returning next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a great little restaurant that is not a chain.  This place is great!  Great food and great service!  The chicken curry was delicious!"}
{"text":"Here I ate for the first time in my life Thai food. In that small but very cozy and clean place I fall in love with the Pad Thai"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food for Las Vegas!!  Smaller restaurant that gives you that home feeling.  The waitresses and owners are very nice people.  They have a great selection.  You get to choose how hot or spicy you want your food.  Great place to have lunch.  Prices are average to a normal restaurant."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite Thai place in town. The location itself is very small about 6 tables and maybe a capacity of 30 people. Everything I have ever had her was excellent and they have been around forever. If you look in the back of the menu's some people write little notes about the place. They are open till 11 most days and closed Sundays I believe. If you want great Thai food at a reasonable price this is your place! I am even willing to go as far as to say they have the best curry in town!"}
{"text":"This place was an absolute gear find.  First of, it is family owned.  It is a very small restaurant with 8 tables. The wore welcomes the guests like old friends.  The evening my partner and I visited the restaurant there were 3 other tables occupied with customers that were repeat customers. The service was friendly and certainly welcoming.  It is a family friendly place but my partner and I were also made to feel welcome and glad we were there to enjoy the food.  
The food was awesome.  Great tasting and excellent price.  It is not glamorous, so for those of you high maintenance and after ambiance rather than good food this is not your place.  The decor was welcoming, clean and not at all fake, the food is what they care about in this place and the price can't be beat.  It is certainly worth the time to drive the 7 miles from the strip to the restaurant.  
We will definitely return when we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"The food is just OK.  It's close to my office so when short on time it's an acceptable option."}
{"text":"I'm impressed with the cleanliness. The food was better than average and service was solid.  Pricing was right.   I'll come back."}
{"text":"I had fond memories of coming to this location many years ago when it was a two person operation.  There was a sweet old woman who based upon the pictures was a beauty queen in Thailand many years ago.  Time had continued to roll on but she continued to relive those days in all her sweet glory.  The other person the chief, was the magic in the back.

After many thoughts of returning a plan was put into action, to dine for lunch.  All I knew was the location, having forgotten the name.  After search the oracle, I determined the Thai restaurant was in the same place I remembered.

When I showed up in the parking lot I was giddy with excitement.  Would the former beauty queen and magic man still be there?  When the door was thrust open, clearly and sadly....things had changed.  They were gone, the pictures were gone, all gone.

What I found was a chic, modern version of a Thai restaurant.  The space is small and be sure to arrive early to avoid the rushes.  There is a great lunch special that let me comfortable and not wanting more when it was time to leave.  I had Chicken Pad Thai which I found to be A-OK.  The service was A-OK."}
{"text":"Very friendly and speedy customer service from the small, family style restaurant.  This is my favorite Thai place in the city.  My favorite dish that keeps me coming back is the green curry and my husband like the pad thai and pad kee mow.  Their spice scale is higher than most places too."}
{"text":"The woman who may serve you your food is the owner and most people refer to her as mama. A very small little dive with good food and nice lunch specials. The green curry is great and so is the pad Thai. I've been here a few times and I would go anytime I'm craving my Thai fix. Let mama take care of you and enjoy the great Thai food. Don't forget to mention I sent ya! LOL"}
{"text":"New go-to place for thai take out!
Went in on Easter evening, and it was totally dead. Called ahead, despite the holiday they were keeping regular hours.

Placed order for silver noodle soup and yellow curry chicken with white rice, spice level 3. Order with tip and tax came to under $20 and was ready in about ten minutes.

Dining room is nicer than many other thai places, with bold red and yellow décor and heavy curtains to provide privacy between tables. Also saw roses in vases on each table. Nice to see a more upscale dining room without overinflated menu prices! Would come back to dine in for a date night.

Stopped by the grocery store on my way home, food was still hot when I got around to eating it. The soup in particular was packed with fresh veggies and a good portion of noodles. There were also bits of chicken and one single shrimp in the dish. Not bad for $7.50, though I'd prefer an extra shrimp.
Yellow chicken curry had a good heat to it at level 3, but the curry itself was slightly thinner than usual. Veggies included carrot and potato, and some larger chicken pieces. Curry was flavorful without being intense, and the rice was just right.

Gotta check out their $2 to go soup special, 11AM-4PM next time: no idea what soup it is, but they did the silver noodle pretty good.
Portions were well-sized: I ordered two dishes specifically so I could half-and-half them for dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow, and was easily able  to do so. Even had a little extra curry for a third meal."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very small and not fancy but the food is authentic and delicious. The panang curry is the best I've ever had, and I will literally crave it if it's been to long."}
{"text":"If I could describe this place in 1 word I would say DEVINE !!!!! They're food is DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!! So so so so yummy I love it ! And the best thing is that they're right next my favorite cleaners !!! Couldn't be a better combination !!!"}
{"text":"Tried Prommare's a few weeks ago and it's my new go-to for Thai food.  It's the best I've had in town and is always consistently good.  The lunch specials are cheap with very large portions.  My favorite is the Kang Ped (red curry) and Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles)... highly recommend them, but everything I have tried is delicious.  I enjoy eating in but expect it to take around 45 minutes because it's always crowded!"}
{"text":"I have been here for both eat- in and take out service. Good both times. Place is tiny and pretty plain,but service is quick and efficient. The $2.00 take out soup is a great bargain for lunch on a budget, and the Pad See Ew was very yummy and when you eat in for lunch, the soup comes with your meal. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Best Thia food ever. Service is great, place is clean would totally recommend it.. It was simply amazing. The chicken fried rice was like nothing i ever had light fresh in taste and not oily.. Sate was perfection. Try the soup wonderful. Its a rare find a diamond in the rough and very inexpensive. Very friendly staff.."}
{"text":"This place is really very small and intimate.  Of course, I'm not sure how authentic any Thai restaurant is in the US but if this is close, it's good.

I had the fried rice and I must say it was very tasty, though a little bit dry. All my table mates seemed to be pretty happy with their meals. 

Unfortunately, the server got the order wrong because she misunderstood what my friend was asking for. No big deal. There was plenty of food to go around so they didn't have to wait.

Like so many restaurants in Las Vegas now, this place is tucked inconspicuously in a strip mall. If you didn't know it was there you wouldn't know it was there. 

So if small, quiet, and very intimate is your thing, with decent though not spectacular food, then Prommares is for you."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years.  Service and food is so good I decided to share the best kept secret.  Our server Tangmo was above and beyond with her service.  She had at least 6 tables but still came around often. The food has never been better. I had the garlic chicken and Mom had the Sweet and sour chicken which she always gets. Their soup is to die for. Just a heads up I usually like very spicy food and usually order an 8 or 9 in spiciness. I order a 5 here and it would probably be too spicy for most people. Keep that in mind when ordering. 5 stars all the way!"}
{"text":"Excellent Pad See Eiw! But the Sticky rice with mango was TDF!! Heaven. Highly recommend this place! Good eats. Reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"While waiting for my vehicle to be serviced at a dealership nearby, read all the great reviews for this establishment. 
I tried one of the lunch specials, Pad Thai, for $7.25. It included a bowl of tasty vegetable soup, & a fried spring roll.  One can order your food on a spice scale of zero to ten. I tried a 6 based on my experiences at my family's fave Thai place, Archi's: normally a 6 can be a pretty spicy dish& I can take spicy.
Here, 6 did not make me sweat ir make my nose run. However, you can add additional heat to your plate with the chiles on each table.

The portion of pad thai was generous and the kitchen was very generous with the amount of chicken they gave you.

I would return here again to try some of their other dishes.

Its apparent the owner has a loyal customer base by they interact with her.  However she greets all her customers warmly as if she knows each one like family."}
{"text":"This place isn't much to look at. But the service and value for the dollar are both incredible.
I've tried several versions of their lunch specials and all were very tasty and I personally feel you get more than what you pay for in terms of both quantity and quality.
The way the lunch specials work is, you choose a meat. This determines the price. After that, it can be prepared in a wide variety of ways. You just choose from the list. If you choose a spicy variant, they let you choose your spiciness on a scale of 1-10. You can get the basics such as beef, chicken and pork for a mere $7.25! If you want a combination of meats, just add $3. Shrimp is $9.25 and \"fancy\" seafood is $12.25. Lunch specials also include an egg roll and a big scoop of rice. And everything comes with a cup of soup. For me the lunch special just fills me up. If you have a big \"American\" appetite, this may not be the place for you.
The service has always been great. And they seem to get you in and out quickly as well, true to gritty Asian form. I wouldn't have it any other way."}
{"text":"By far the BEST Thai Food in Las Vegas! Ok, I admit, I am a traditional Thai Food addict and have drove from one end of the valley to the other in search of great Thai food and this place is my all time favorite!  We eat here all the time and never get tired of it like many places.

Large portions at a very reasonable price for example, over twice the quantity of food (and much tastier) at less than half the price of the Thai place on Fremont St. 

The little Thai lady who runs the place is so sweet and I feel that sweetness comes through in the quality and taste of their delicious food.

Only 10 minutes from The Stratosphere landmark  or LVBLVD & Sahara (The Strip)

Thanks Prommares, for many years of great service and food and apologies I took so long to write this review."}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere; like being in their family dining room. Service is very warm and friendly and quick!! $8 for a chicken lunch special with soup and egg roll is awesome. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a small hidden place in the same complex as Big Dogs. Don't let the outside fool you, it is a hole in the wall but definitely worth a try! Its pretty cozy inside so be prepared to hear everyones conversation in the room. I ordered the Pad Thai at level 3 for spicy. It was PERFECT! The portions are big and since I can't handle too much spice, 3 was good enough to give it that kick that I could taste without breaking a sweat. 

There are hand sanitizers at each table and the staff is friendly and attentive. My total bill for two people came out to $25. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Foods was ok, just average nothingWOW. but the lady who take the order just really turn my appetite off, wasn't nice at all.
Not coming back again, there's more other Thai restaurants with better taste and better service!!"}
{"text":"very poorly lit restaurant with tiny tiny portions

The sweet and sour pork dish we ordered was 4 spoonfuls tops! It had more of the wonton crunch noodle things than anything else. If you STILL plan on eating here bring a flashlight and a half full stomach."}
{"text":"i really like this restaurant! first time i came here i had the pad  thai and egg rolls. the pad thai was great. i asked for a 1 cus i want to enjoy my food and not gulp down glasses of water. its probably my favorite place for pad thai in town. when the egg rolls came out i asked if they were hand rolled or store bought. they hand roll them in the back. they were rolled so neatly it was almost too pretty to eat. but the hungry stomach always wins. i told the lady in the back that they were so pretty and she kinda waved and nodded and i guess went back to making more egg rolls. but i had a chance to talk to the owners son and we got to talkin shop. some of our experiences running a restaurant. nice guy. honest and realistic."}
{"text":"The best Panang Chicken dish I have ever tried and I've tried so many. I have been coming to this spot for 3 years and it has always tastes delicious and fresh. Owner is very friendly. Small hole in the wall but their food taste amazing and authentic."}
{"text":"Phone order. Was supposed to deliver at our hotel. Was late an hour!!. No communication... Couldn't even get a hold of them. Rude/horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Good thai food with solid lunch specials.  Particularly a fan of the Pad Thai, Curries and Thai beef jerky.  Great little gem in a neighborhood that needs more locals options."}
{"text":"I got white rice with a spring roll. It was yummy to my tummy. So I give them five stars. I love rice so I will stop in more often. The spring roll was new for me I never had one until now. It was different but still excellent!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this quaint little place and fell in love!! The food is incredible and the prices are so great!! We ordered the spicy beef Thai salad and the pad Thai and it was by far the best Thai food we've ever had!!  The owners are so sweet. I loved that they had hand sanitizer to use at the tables too."}
{"text":"This is one of the better places to go for curry!

I like the hole-in-wall family owned feel.  Everything I've had here has been good, but they truly shine when it comes to curry.  There are other Thai places I like more, but if I may emphasize just one more time, there are none that I like more in town for curry.

A few of my friends that lived in Thailand or have Thai parents will only eat here...that says something good i my book."}
{"text":"Hand Sanitizer on every table- Nice!

This place is small -I hope you enjoy rubbing elbows with the next table. Despite the close quarters, this restaurant offers quality Thai food at reasonable prices. They feature lunch specials that include a delicious soup, egg roll, white rice, and your choice of entree. I chose the chili mint with sliced chicken (Level 5). The soup was fantastic! At first glance it looked like a bunch of celery in a clear broth that I wasn't excited to try. But of nowhere, it smacks you with complex flavors that will make your head spin. Wait, was that a spicy bite I just had? Hah, what was that crunch? AMAZING!

My only small complaint was that the chicken was a little overdone, as well as the rice. Have you ever eaten burnt rice that was stuck to the bottom of the rice cooker? Yeah-- that! However, the flavor combination that the chicken chili mint had was so good and spiced perfectly. Finally -a restaurant that doesn't skimp on ingredients. I would definitely come back -at a less busy time so I don't have to have the guy next to me breathing on me. Good thing the hand sanitizer was close by......."}
{"text":"Family run business, serving food filled with love and compassion.  They even deliver.  I would have given more stars, but they use a great deal of styrofoam and plastic.  Their food tastes just like being home."}
{"text":"This tiny little place packs a huge world of yummy.  Terrific Thai.  Everything was fresh, with quality veggies and lean proteins. They nicely adjusted spice for each of our group.  Attentive service from the lovely staff."}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM YUM YUMMMM. That's all I think about when this place comes to mind. Hands down my favorite thai place in town. Their mussaman (spell check) is amazing. It's close to my job, lunch is always wonderful here. And I've gotten a handful of coworkers hooked on it as well lol."}
{"text":"The food is really good and very authentic. It's Thai owned and tastes pretty close to the real thing (I lived in Bangkok 2 years). They sometimes mess up the spice levels, but oh well."}
{"text":"This place is an average Thai restaurant - nothing to dance and sing about. We ordered take out pad thai and the pad see ew. Both dishes were dry and the noodles seemed to be undercooked. 

However, the flavors of both dishes were great. I really appreciated the spice levels they offered. I ordered both dishes a spicy #8 and it delivered a nice spicy kick that wasn't unbearable - It added a great spicy flavor. 

As much as I prefer my noodles to be tender, moist and juicy, I couldn't stop eating them because the flavors were there. Maybe next time I'll try dining inside of the restaurant with hopes that it will come out juicier!"}
{"text":"What can I say, Prommares is one of the Thai food gems in Las Vegas.  This small, hole in the wall is a genuine Thai food restaurant.  I've had a few dishes here, and none have disappointed me.  While I still say that the Thai Grill on Decatur and Lake Mead is the best Thai food in Vegas, this is a very close second.

Although I am not a huge fan of their style of curry, the yellow curry is still quite tasty without being too sweet, along with fluffy and delicious white rice.  I've also had the Seafood Special, which has squid, crab (in the shell), shrimp, over a very good homemade sauce.  The crab legs are a little difficult to work with, so be in the mood for the whole cracking crab legs open thing!  The Pad Thai is also very good, although I have heard that they changed their recipe in the last year or two, and it isn't quite as good as it used to be.  

Perhaps the one dish that stands out here though is the Rad Na (Lad Na).  The gravy sauce has a smoky flavor that is just amazing. There is a light smoky flavor to the noodles.  The meat is always fresh and well prepared, and the Chinese Broccoli is also very fresh and tasty.  This is definitely the best Rad Na in town that I have had.  

For anyone who appreciates real authentic Thai, this place is probably now the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My favorite type of food is Thai and this is by far one of the best Thai places I have ever had. I got the Pad See Ew (level 10) and it was beyond amazing. The soy sauce sweetness and the spiciness of my food created an even balance of our deliciousness. I had my entree with the Crab Rangoon's. These were also great! Overall I had a great experience. Can't wait to bring my gf here when she visits! Solid 10/10."}
{"text":"Great and tastey thai food. Friendly staff, and have never been happier choosing this place as my favorite thai restaurant. It is a family business so it is small with less people working, but if its busy its well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I went here on a suggestion from a coworker. I couldn't write one bad thing about it if I tried. The service was prompt, friendly, and the dish that I had was top notch and had excellent flavor. And it is very cheap for a great tasting fresh meal!"}
{"text":"The food is great! 
The service is excellent. 
I have come here often and I'm always greeted with a smile and friendly conversation. 
If you enjoy spicy food in a cozy atmosphere.. This is the place. 
I just came in and ordered take out.. But this is where they SHINE.. I was given a bowl of soup for free \"while I wait\" because I told them I was out shopping and got hungry.. Awww"}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food.  You might need to add a little chili to the heat level #10, though."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I don't particularly like Thai food.  The only time in my life when I really enjoyed Thai food was in Bangkok.  My experience with Thai food in the US has generally been that it is not very tasty or, worse yet, it is so drenched in heat that it is hard to taste anything at all (you know, with a mouth full of seared flesh and whatnot).  So what was I doing trying Prommares?  There are a few reasons.  First, it has these great Yelp reviews.  Second, it is really close to my house - so it's convenient and cheap enough for a fling.  Third, a lot of the menu isn't anything that I think of as being particularly \"Thai\" - there are a lot of dishes that I think of as being more Chinese, such as Mongolian beef, Sweet & sour chicken, and Potstickers.  Fourth, they allow you to choose the level of heat that you want, so no risk of having my mouth burnt to a crisp.  So we ordered for takeout.

My mistake.  We ordered half a dozen dishes, and every one of them was awful.  The protein - whether it was chicken, beef, pork, or shrimp - was tough and flavorless.  The veg to protein ratio was way too high, and the vegetables were not even very good.  My wife also thought that it was mostly inedible.

I hate giving such a bad review to what I assume is a family-owned business.  The woman who handed our food across the counter was very nice, and because our order was large she even threw in some complementary soup (also awful).  I wish them well, and I'm sorry for the bad review.  I'm also sorry that I don't have plans to be back in Bangkok anytime soon, because I sure would like to have some good Thai food."}
{"text":"Prommares gets two stars because I had an awful customer service experience there over the weekend. This is even more unfortunate because the food on its own deserved four to five stars (although the portions are smaller than you would expect). 

I came in around 6:30 or 7 with four friends. We ordered tom kah, level 10 panang curry, level 4 yellow curry, pad thai, and a couple other things. When my level 10 panang arrived at the table, I tasted it and it wasn't spicy at all. I look over at my friend who ordered the level 4 yellow, and she's choking, turning red and chugging water. I tried a spoonful of her curry, and it is very obviously significantly spicier than mine. 

We called over the waitress, and informed her that we're pretty sure the chef mixed up our level 10 and level 4. The waitress and another employee double down, and say that we are wrong. They insisted that the panang was a level 10 and the yellow was a level 4. Remember, I tasted both of these dishes. The panang had almost no spice (to the point where I had to dump in chili flakes to get it to my liking), and the yellow burned. 

But no- the staff wouldn't remake her food. I'm not an awful friend, the very first thing I tried to do was switch plates with my friend. Unfortunately, she just doesn't like panang and didn't want it. 

So instead of just admitting their mistake and remaking her curry, the Prommares staff let my friend sit there watching us all eat, knowing she was unable to tolerate the spice level of what they gave her. And she still had to pay for it."}
{"text":"Amazing! Possibly the best Thai food I've had, ever! The papaya salad was spicy but good and the pad see ew and panang curry were both delicious! Also a great deal! But the best part was the owner who served us. She was SO SWEET and made us feel like we were being served by our own auntie. I'm glad we purchased property in Vegas because I plan to keep coming back to this place again and again."}
{"text":"This place was really good at one time but it's gone way down ever since they started being cheap on meat and ingredients. I got chicken pad Thai and as with all the dishes here they put VERY LITTLE chicken beef shrimp or pork I guess business is bad and they can't afford to serve quality dishes such a shame..! Maybe it's even time for SOUTHERN NEVADA HEALTH DISTRICT TO      Stop by for inspection"}
{"text":"The garlic beef is awesome, & the pad see ew was really good, although the chicken was a little dry. Good prices, good food, & quiet atmosphere, which I like."}
{"text":"My tattoo shop was up the street from here for many years we would eat here 4 + times a week. unfortunately we moved so I only get to eat here a few times a month now. every other Thai restaurant I get food from is terrible in comparison! Prommares is always so delicious they have the best flavor !! And when you order Thai spicy number 10 it is actually spicy!! When I have time it's always worth the trip across town because it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and the atmosphere is very comfortable. Almost like your in someone's home. Very relaxing indeed."}
{"text":"came here one afternoon while waiting for some car service next door. We made it just in time for their lunch specials and although I looked over the menu trying to decide if I should try something new, I stuck with my normal pad see ew (i can never go wrong with that!) while Dan had the pad thai. the service was friendly and the place had people, but was not jam packed. our waitress kept coming over to refill our water glasses even while they were still half full. We got our food pretty quickly and one bite in I was hooked. so much flavor in my plate! and for the lunch special pricing I had a full on entree right in front of me along with a summer roll too. I was so pleased.
this whole delightful lunch only took about 45 minutes and was less than $20.00 for two people and a thai iced tea. I will for sure be returning to get my pad see ew fix."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered Thai Tea with no ice, BUT unnotified of a $1.50 fee for preferring no ice. Ordered Pad See Eiw and Crab Rangoon . Pretty nice price. Good flavor. BUT My friend ordered as well some spicy rice and paid $6 gave her $20 and received $6 back there was $8 missing and we aren't from around here and we will never come here. They jip people for money when in a hurry."}
{"text":"Much like my last GF, PTF ain't a looker, but she gets the job done. A-OK in my book. 
Came in to this small joint around 2pm to pick up some lunch. I was hooked before I even stepped inside. Why? There's a sign on the door \"24oz soup, $2\". Deal! After being seated, service was prompt and friendly. My order of ginger tofu with rice, (mini) egg roll and a soup set me back about $7 and was the perfect medium heat at spice level 5. Am i going out of my way to come back here? Nah, but I wouldn't hesitate to return when looking for lunch in the area."}
{"text":"This place is definitely underrated.  It's like finding a girl who is a solid 7 in appearance, but once you get to know her, she immediately earns 2 more points.   

It's extremely affordable, small, cozy setting, with waitress's who are sweet as a madame at a massage parlor (so i have been told by my friend who i go with)  

Thumbs up to the squid salad, papaya salad, all the curries, and pad thai.

Honestly, you can't go wrong with any choice here ---  

Tip - Be sure to use the head (that would be the restroom) where you'll walk through the pristine kitchen.  I like to hit up Good Will afterwards to look for cd's and other kitchen gear :0"}
{"text":"First time Here, 
Good food, 
I have the shrimp spicy egg plant and a beef salad.
The service was great, will return."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked in, I felt like I was in a home getting authentic Thai food. They didn't disappoint! I'm definitely coming back. 

What I liked: 
-They give you actual tea cups and a tea pot when you order tea. 
-You automatically get served a bowl of soup. 
-The atmosphere is quiet and calming
-I loved the Pad See Ew & the Chicken Pan Nang
-The service was nice. The owner took great care of us and all of her customers. 
-Very reasonably priced for everything they serve you! 

What I didn't like: 
-The tables and chairs could be updated, but I understand that sometimes looks aren't the priority."}
{"text":"Love it. Near my house and always end up going here twice a month for dinner on my way back from my shop. Its fast its easy and the flavors are spot on. I normally get the spicy eggplant 6* rating. My wife will get the prik king or the chicken fried rice. The spice eggplant is done on point. There is no soggy about it. Other places over cook the eggplant and it tastes bad. This reminds me of being back home in Hawaii at a little thai shop there. The owner is a little thai lady who is very nice and laid back. I also like their curries. I haven't really tried much else other than the pad thai but really wasn't a fan of the way it was done.  either way good little thai joint to try out."}
{"text":"Haven't had Thai food in a couple months.  This one's open 'til 10pm.  Lately I haven't been hungry throughout the day.  So my hunger pang screams at me by evening.  This was a great choice to mellow the grumpy stomach.

Sure we got here while the parking lot was empty.  (Only some people we saw go into the democratic party office next door.)  And so of course food service was attentive.  Our food was cooked fresh; we heard the sizzling of our pad see you noodles.

Flavor of the Pad See You noodles was perfect.  We had rice to go with our mild green curry so couldn't have much noodles.  The mild Green Curry Chicken was just as awesome.  I suggest this without debate for your meal.  And their Tom Kha soup really appetizing.

Interior of the restaurant is very nice!  Although I'd say it is casual dining, their art work to me looks so elegant.  They use a lot of gold tones and reddish orange in their decor - almost majestic. 

I have no cons to mention.  It's a good idea to get here later in the evening if you enjoy a quiet meal; too tired or feeling blah to have conversation hahaahaa.  Thai iced tea is served here without boba.  Handle your grumpy tummy with Thai food!"}
{"text":"Best little hole the wall Thai food place I  have been to in awhile. You definitely can tell that it is a mom and pops type of place, with all the love and traditions and family wisdom found in the recipes they use. I personally love getting the satay chicken, cream cheese rangoons, masaman, panang, and pad Thai. The waitresses are easy going with the right amount of attentiveness. I will definitely keep eating here."}
{"text":"This place is definitely worth trying! It's a hole in the wall that's pretty small. I literally feel like I am walking into someone's kitchen while visiting their home! Very traditional Thai decor and music playing- that is when it is playing. The service is always very swift. I like that she serves water in clean glass cups- it just tastes better to me. But what's something to really appreciate is their Thai tea. It's one of the best and is so freakin delicious and perfect, much like the various entrees you can order from the massive menu. L&L their Pad Thai is a little different tasting but it could be the hidden touches of home. The larb is to die for and I'm crazy about their mussaman curry. Pad se ew is really delicious too! The only reason why I wouldn't give 5 stars is because sometimes the food is not always consistently cooked right. Like sometimes the potatoes are still hard or the noodles will be undercooked, but I still find myself coming back. I love the little lady who owns this place- it's a definite hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place may be small,but being a Thai food eater here in Vegas...this is by far one of the best ones I've been to yet. Small atmosphere,decorated with their home ideas and flavorful food!"}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Vegas so far. The value is unbeatable. $7.50 gets you any one of their lunches with chicken or tofu, rice, soup and eggroll. I had panang curry and was impressed with the richness and complexity. Easily 5 stars when factoring in cost and quality."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 11 years.  This is the best thai food restaurant in Vegas! 

They know how to make a wonderful curry, perfectly balanced sweet/spicy.  The restaurant is family owned and simple, but the food is delish and priced well.  Order the chicken Panang and Pad thai, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Prommares by a buddy who hadn't been there in 15 years. He says, \"How about Thai food? I know a good place on Sahara. Haven't been there is a while, but it used to be good,\" Well, if it was as good 15 years ago as it is now, it's no surprise they are still around. 

We were seated promptly, with water and soup brought to the table almost immediately. I chose the Mongalian Beef with a spicy level of seven. Probably could have gone up a notch or two, but the forehead was sweating nonetheless. The food was hot and fresh and included an egg roll in addition to the soup. The beef was tender and lean with plenty of fresh vegetables and rice. The portion size with plentiful, especially for a lunch special, which will run you around eight bucks before you add a beverage. I was introduced to Larb beef as an appetizer, which was an interesting blend of ground meat and spices with lots of flavor. 

We rolled in just prior to the traditional lunch hour and it got busier the longer we were there.  Located on Sahara near Torrey Pines, it might not be real convenient depending upon where you are, but it is definitely worth a drive. Some of the best Thai food I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The place is tiny and dim. Bring a flashlight. Curries don't come with rice. Wth? Perfect for people on a diet as the portions are tiny. Bring a magnifying glass to see the chicken in the Orange Chicken underneath a pile of crispy wonton strips. The crab is difficult to eat, just so you know. Panang is really delicious, all three bites of it. Overall A-OK for me."}
{"text":"This has been the best Asian food I've had in Vegas.

Our Thai \"auntie\" was the best hostess possible and served up some authentic home-style cooking.  The little bowl of porridge served before the entree reminded me of being at home.  Yum, perfect to cut the grime from just being in Vegas, period.

Thai Iced tea was good and there was a varying level of spiciness you could choose from for the fried rice and pad see ew dish that my friends and I shared.  

We wanted to stick around for the sticky mango dessert but we were so full we couldn't make room for it. 

The best thing was the advice she gave us.. to stay young, keep moving, and let things go.  Bottling things up or staying too concerned about things will only make you age faster.  She is a very proud and delightful mother and I think she was happy to give us some heart-warming advice.  I took it for what it's worth and happily logged it into my book of life mantra's.  If you're craving Thai and out in the Vegas neck of the woods, visit Prommares.  It will hit the spot."}
{"text":"Fresh & delicious. The pad thai is fabulous & they have the best curry in town. Love the seafood fried rice too"}
{"text":"Had a coupon, so I tried it. I wouldn't have noticed it was here if I hadn't looked for it. Take my advice : look for it. Good service.  Prices are not bad. Food is great."}
{"text":"Located on the corner of Torrey Pines and Sahara is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas.  The name Prommares is after the Hindu god Praprom the deity of fortune and good luck.

I love coming here for lunch because they have great lunch specials.  It's just the basic Thai dishes, but everything here is always fresh and authentic.  I always get the Pad See-Eew ( I think that's the one w/ the Chinese broccoli and the flat pan fried noodles) It's always perfect and so is the Tom Kai soup.

I like that its a small family owned restaurant w/ a small and intimate setting.  It's never really crowded and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Thai place in town. I love the vibe, love the service and absolutely LOVE the food. So much attention to detail and flavors. I love ordering from here so much that I do it every week."}
{"text":"The food is delicious but the decor leaves little to be desired. The decor looks as if it is still stuck in the 1970s.

When you order, you're asked what level of spice you'd like - 0 -10. I had Pad Se Ew with shrimp at ZERO level spice. My girl had the Garlic Beef at a spice level of 7. Boy did she regret that and said should have ordered a 5. 

The wait staff were quite attentive. At one point we had our phones and a few other items on the table, so our server brought us a TV tray (yes, from the 1970s) and sat it next to our table for those things to be put on. The thing looked like something your grandma might whip out when you visit.

The food is 5 stars.
The decor is 3 stars"}
{"text":"You know, this is place has so much potential, if only they had more than 2 waitresses and a bigger place. My visits have all been during lunch hour and always I leave 15 minutes early to arrive at noon and catch a place to sit. They literally have about 5 tables and two waitresses! Waitress with the long hair, TOTAL DOLL. Short, older lady-NOT so nice. She needs a day off or something. 

On a brighter note, the food is phenomenal! The soup served prior to your meal is my favorite part of visiting this place. Not too much on their menu, so anything on there is a WIN.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Seriously I would never found out this place if I wasn't starving after thrifting at goodwill. I thought it was a thai fast food but no, it's a family owned thai restaurant. Best thai food I've had in vegas. Prices tend to be a little on the pricy side but you get a very generous portion."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for lunch for years.  Perfect portion in the sense you don't feel so stuffed that you will slip into a food coma for the next few hours.  Reasonable price but sometimes the wait time is quite long for an office lunch break.

Favorites:  Pad Thai Tofu with extra vegetables, Mixed vegetable, Massaman Curry, Pad Woo Sen"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot period. I've been coming here for 10+years, love the service, food is to die for.... from the fried rice to their soups all is just finger licking good!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the portions aren't too big. The presentation of the food makes the experience even better! The only thing I didn't like was that my food wasn't spicy enough. The woman who took my order asked me \"how hot do you want your food? Ten being the highest\". I like my food spicy so I said \"9\". When my order came my food wasn't very spicy AT ALL! I expressed that on my next visit and my food was very spicy. This place is a little hole in the wall and it is always busy... The food is great. I also like how the keep hand sanitizer on the end of the table. That comes in handy. Do not miss out on this one..."}
{"text":"Really great food! Will definitely be back. My husband and I ordered a 4 on the spice scale (1-10) and it was still quite hot so keep that in mind when ordering :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place service is great they make you feel very welcome like part of the family it's very clean food is top notch don't pass this one up"}
{"text":"This place is great. It is small place where they are all friendly. They are a little light on their heat. I asked for a 9-10 and they said no way, you no like a 10... They have soon found that I like the heat. 

Open for dinner but only have about 10 tables, so get there early."}
{"text":"We have been here twice so far and loved it both times.    Last we went with a party of 5 we all ordered and entrée with one dessert.  Our total came to $48. (we are water drinkers so no bev's on check)  There was even food to take home.   It was amazing.  

this is defiantly a hidden little jem."}

{"text":"The best Thai we have found in Las Vegas! Awesome for dine in and take out!"}
{"text":"We had a nice meal there this week.  It reminded us of a favorite Thai restaurant we used to frequent in another city, small, in a strip mall, and good food.  There is nothing fancy, but everything we ate was good.  One of our gauges for Thai food is Tom Kha soup and Prommares compares well with our other favorite in town, Thai House on S Maryland Pkwy.  Both of them serve Tom Kha with plenty of flavoring from lime leaf, galanga, and lemon grass.  Both restaurants' soups have whole lime leaves, chunks of galanga root, and lots of lemon grass in the soup, and you can really taste all three of those ingredients.  You have to eat around these as they're tough, but it's worth it.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars, really, is because it's not a fancy place and the chicken was a bit tough (and, unlike the other soup ingredients, chicken isn't supposed to be tough!).  Everything else about the meal was great, though.

The food was plentiful and very reasonably priced.  We spent about $45 including tax & tip for two of us and went away full and with enough food for a second dinner the next night.

Happy!  Will return."}
{"text":"After a long afternoon of shopping, my boyfriend and I were feeling some Thai food. With the help of Siri, we found this location and called in an order for pick up.
We ordered Pad Thai, Rad Nah, and mint chicken, along with a box of rice, all for 23.51! Not only was it inexpensive but it really fulfilled our craving.

What really got me was the mint chicken. Normally, anywhere I order this dish, the meat is always grounded up, which I'm not a fan of, but this place had chunks of chicken. As for the taste of all the dishes, the taste is a little, little bit bland compared to a few other places, but for me, it was fine that way.

The only thing that was off was the \"spicy scale\". We ordered a 3 for everything on a scale of 1-10, and my mouth was burning after a few bites. As for customer service, I can't necessarily comment on it since we just ordered to go, but the lady wasn't rude at all. She said thank you and have a nice day.

This place isn't my favorite Thai restaurant, but I'd definitely come back! It was a very good meal for a very good price :)"}
{"text":"Initially my first thoughts on this place is: hella salty!  I had the pad se eww off their lunch menu, and I couldn't get more than two bites in without having to chug down my water. :( The flavors and spiciness were perfect, but the amount of sodium they threw in the dish was just overbearing. 

As for the place, it was really small. 
Service was nice and attentive.
Another down side to this place was their portions. They were small and pricey for lunch specials."}
{"text":"Fresh and hot as usual, can customize the spice level"}
{"text":"Best thai food in Vegas!!!! I recommend this play the curry is excellent and the chicken noodle so awesome!! Everything on the menu is delicious and service is really good!! Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"The lady is very nice the food and price is very good.  This place is for anyone who actually likes spice this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I ordered yellow curry w/ chicken and beef pad see-ew, both w/ a spice level of 5. The portions were decent. The food tasted fresh. Although the spice was just right, I felt the curry needed more seasoning. Their Thai tea is delicious, but it was almost $4 for a very small serving. I will order take out for lunch from there again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Vegas!Nice little hole in the wall.Crab pot & spicy garlic chicken is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love the rating of how spicy I want my Thai food to be. Excellent service and great food. It's all about Pad See Ew and Panang Curry with this place. 
If you go here on lunch any day of the week, you get an eggroll and a cup of soup with your meal. The soup is very simple but delicious. Always plenty to share per entree."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai! Little hole in the wall family run restaurant. Great price for what you pay. Don't be deceived by the out side. This place is a hidden gem! You know it's authentic when they don't give lime with your pad Thai!"}
{"text":"We came here for Thai food with one $. It was a little pricier than expected and servings weren't generous. Decor is cute. Space is tiny. A-ok if this is your neighborhood Thai spot. No need to go out of your way."}
{"text":"We had a big meal...Thai eggrolls, level 3 chicken curry and pad see ew, level 0 orange chicken, chicken pad Thai levels 7 and 10.  Eggrolls were good but tiny, curry was spicy, pad see ew was delish, orange chicken was nearly rock hard, and pad Thai was good.  Level 10 was too much and my hubby will dial back next time.  A lucky Yelp find near our home."}
{"text":"While its not Lotus it was tasty an the women were nice. The cook was singing so I'm sure food was made with love."}
{"text":"Wow this was great! I had beef Panang (stellar!!) and chicken Pad Woon Sen. Fabu with all the huge mushrooms, tomatoes and other goodies. Service was extremely polite and they let me use my $10 Radio Shopping Show certificate to go, even though it says \"dine in only.\" Again, great service. 

Note: I ordered 2-3 star hotness. I was sniffling and suffering a little - it was what I would expect from a typical 8 (their scale goes to 10). I can take some heat. I put chili flakes on almost everything. Honestly, if their 2-star gives you the sniffles, then good GOD the 10 will melt your eyeballs. I'm just saying - you might want to watch out. ;) 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"While in the area, and after a Yelp event my friends and I were hungry. I wanted some Thai and this place popped up. It was only a hop, skip, and a jump away from where we were so we headed on out. You will miss it if you don't look for it closely in the shopping center. Just have to look for that big sign that says \"THAI\". 

The place is small, cozy, and has a very \"family\" charm to it. This is mostly why I am a fan. I love places that are like this. It makes me happy to be giving my money over to people who are running a business to feed their family, and not a corporate conglomerate so they can fuel their yacht. Anyway.

Food - I ordered the Chicken Curry at a spicy level of 6. I wish I had gone with an 8 because it was not very spicy at all. Although I did not mind, it was still very good. BUT, again, wish it had been spicier. I just have to test the waters of places before I can allow myself to go up into the higher numbers, so I won't ding them too much since I left without even having to wipe my nose once. I also wished for more potatoes in my curry. I really love getting those potatoes, they're such a nice surprise. 

Service - Friendly and happy. But my table felt a little out of place when our dishes were taken away but the check was not delivered. After all, the place is small, so when we were done, it was quite obvious. We actually had to ask for the check. 

Price - A good price for what I originally thought was a small portion - but no, it was just fooling me. I didn't even finish my entire bowl. But I did get rice. We got a big portion of rice for two people. We were not charged extra for the rice... which I found interesting since I saw Misti's previous review noting the extra rice charge.... 

Unfortunately I did not partake of the Thai Iced Tea, which I normally do when I eat Thai because I loooove it, but I really just wanted water. Maybe next time I am back at Prommares I will get the Iced Tea. 

Overall - I like the homey vibe and I personally like the smallness of the establishment. The food is good and so is the value. PLUS - there is hand sanitizer on every table, but I believe this is because you must walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom? Because I saw one patron go back there in search of it. Anyway, I'd go back definitely."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Las Vegas. They ask you how spicy you want it 1 to 10. A 3 is very spicy to me. They have a good lunch special. We go out of our way to eat here."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for years. My favorite dish by far is the seafood fried rice, I order it regularly! I also like the garlic beef and garlic chicken. I order a spicy level of #5 its hot, but not so hot that you can't taste the flavors in the food. The thai iced tea is a perfect compliment to the spicy food. I really recommend you try this place, don't judge it by the location... gotta go in and taste!"}
{"text":"Tried these guys out from Uber eats since our regular Thai place was unavailable. The chicken fried rice was good however the pad Thai was to salty. Could barely even finish it! The chicken that was in it was different from the one used in the fried rice. Might give them a shot again at a later time but not any time soon unfortunately"}
{"text":"I came in to order the Beef salad but due to my sensitive stomach I kindly asked if they could cook the Beef and separate it from the salad so it wouldn't wilt the lettuce and I would have my beef warmed up. The lady refused to meet my request which was so unfortunate. I never knew a Thai place to turn you away just because you wanted the Beef warm. I will not be returning to this uncooperative restaurant. Not customer service based. Just another small business forcing their unwilling ways on how your food should be eaten."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place. Yes, the food had good flavor, but the service, the decor and the customer experience made this place not worth it. We ordered the yellow curry for dinner which had a very good and traditional flavor. However, the portion size was smaller than your normal Thai restaurant. In addition they charge you extra for the rice! I have never been to a Thai restaurant where the curry does not come with rice. The rice was cheap, but I still felt like they do not care to provide good service. 
The decor was old and not very attractive. And the service, well the service was very mediocre. It appears that most of the good reviews come from the lunch special which appear to be very cheap, but my dinner experience was not good. Thankfully, this town provides us with several options where the food, the atmosphere and the service are great! Therefore, I do not think I will be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"My post may be a little biased since my visit to Prommares happened to be on one of the hottest days of summer yet and the AC was broken.  

So there we were sweating our a$$es off but too hungry and lazy to go elsewhere.  I ordered the pad-woon-sen which I've ordered before here during lunch and remembered it being pretty good.  This time, the noodles were a bit soggy and wet for my liking and it was also a bit too salty.  My friend ordered a chicken mint which was borderline mediocre as it was not minty and dry enough as well.  

I'll probably give this place another try but as for now, I'd stick with archis or pinkow."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed as the previous owner must have sold .....the shrimp fried rice was more of a steamed rice with no flavor.....the Orange chicken was dry 

."}
{"text":"love this place for a quick bite or togo order. I always get Pad Thai, spicy level 4 which does have some kick but they put lots of vegetables in which I feel helps to tame the spiciness. I LOVE that they are open til 10 for those later night cravings."}
{"text":"*this review is more based on customer service and a recent order than it is for the typical quality of their food*

Usually the food is pretty good.  The last order was the tom yung, pad thai, and chicken pan'ang.  All were ordered at a five spice level.  When I got the food home and we started digging in, it was more like a 9.  I called to let them know and they basically told me it was my fault for not knowing that the peppers right now are much spicier.  Not sure how that is relevant.  If the peppers are spicier, you put less in so that a five is a five, not a nine!  They did offer to make a new order, but that was not feasible.  So they offered to give me a soup the next time I came in.  A soup?  Really?  I just spend $35 on food that was inedible and the compensation was a soup?  I told them that I would like a new order the next time I came in.  I was told I would have to bring in the old food for them to see.  So in order for this to happen, the food would sit in the fridge for maybe two weeks, then sit in my car all day and then I would bring it in to them so they cold look at it, and then if they maybe thought they didn't believe me that it was too spicy, they wouldn't credit?   This does not make sense.  I was going to do this, but then I took it as an insult.  I won't say that I am one of their best customers, but maybe once or twice a month.  This place is convenient, but there are plenty of Thai places that are just as good, if not better, so I figure I won't be patronizing them for a while."}
{"text":"The restaurant was filled to its 28-person capacity on our arrival for lunch with several people waiting for take out.  It took approximately 15 minutes for us to be seated at a small table for 2.  We ordered a couple of soft drinks and shared an order of Tom Kha Kai soup (a spicy coconut based chicken soup with lemon grass and galanga) that was perfectly balanced and delicious."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but food is amazing. This was our second time here. The first time we had lunch and they offer lunch specials and take out. Tonight we went for dinner and it was quiet only two other tables had customers, maybe because it was late. The service is quick and excellent just like the food, we will continue to stop in every time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great food and great lunch special prices.  It's a good idea to order more and have leftovers for later in the week!  I feel as though the spice gets 3x more spicy when you re heat though.  Nice people own/work there and the food is always consistently yummy.  Sometimes the restaurant fills up (it's a small hole in the wall) so there might be a wait during peak times."}
{"text":"Their food is great, I really enjoyed red curry with vegetables. Level of spicy was just right. Nothing fancy, at first we wasn't even sure if we want to eat there, place didn't looks good, but we didn't regret. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food. If you don't like spicy it may not be for you.
Excellent service. Kind of a mom and pop store.
Very reasonable price.

Hits all my criteria for a good restaurant"}
{"text":"Honestly, there are much better thai place than Prommares.  I only give it 3 stars because it is close to work and the lady who works there is really nice.

A bit overpriced for the portion.  I had the spicy basil and the spicy eggplants before, and they were neither disappointing nor amazing.  It's one of those places where you just kind of settle.  The atmosphere of the restaurant kind of fools you into believing this is an authentic thai restaurant, so maybe you'll give more stars to this place than I would. 

Anyways, lunch is ok, but definitely would not recommend my friends to come hang out here..."}
{"text":"When you need some Thai food that hits the spot this is the place to go. Walking you'll find an authentic Thai food restaurant. The service is nice. The food is even better :) There portions are just right. Spicy peppers and sweet sauce with the rice will leave you coming back for more"}
{"text":"The picky hubby couldn't decide what to eat but finally picked this Thai place. We were starving so we ordered a whole bunch of stuff from Shrimp Pad Thai, Beef Drunken noodles, Veggie Spring Rolls, Fried Rice, and Curry.

I don't understand why the Curry does not come with rice during dinner hours? that does not make sense to me. Are you supposed to eat it plain Jane? so that's why the hubby ordered fried rice to eat it with. Coconut milk kinda curry is not my thing but it was decent, the hubby liked it. The Veggie spring rolls came out in 5 pieces and of course they were small, but they were nice and crispy. It tasted like any other Chinese veggie spring roll, stuffed with cabbage.

Fried rice has that chard/ burnt taste to it, I think it's the type of rice that they used... I really didn't like it. The pad Thai was decent, and the drunken noodles really didn't have flavor to it. I went with spice level 8 and that did nothing for me. I wish the drunken noodles had more taste to it since it's my favorite dish to get. I liked how the bill was cheap, I thought I was gonna get charged an arm and and a leg for these dishes but it came out fair."}
{"text":"Doesn't live up to the hype, pad Thai and pad kee Mao were just Ok, had a very bbq like flavor that we don't normally associate with Thai food.. On to the next!"}
{"text":"I CRAVE THIS!!!! I love their Panang and Pad tai. I realy like their Chai ice tea too!"}
{"text":"I will review after I eat but the entrees don't come with rice, and she was wrong on the phone and they do NOT offer what I ordered. Sigh.
 I wouldn't go back, and I think it was very expensive for what it was."}
{"text":"This place is a nice little restaurant!
The lunch menu has plenty of choices to choose from! Lunch menu comes with a soup, egg roll, and rice. But if you order a noodle entrée, rice is not included. Pretty good portions for a good price!

There was only one waitress and she was very helpful while still running all over the place. Her efforts were much appreciated.

I like to order Pad Thai at thai restaurants because it's easy for me to compare what I like. The Pad Thai here was mixed and saucy. I enjoyed it!! I ordered a spice level 5 out of 10! Pretty spicy for a level 5, and I can usually handle up to a 7! So beware of that! My coworkers all ordered different foods such as curry, Mongolian beef, and chicken noodle- they all enjoyed their meals as well!"}
{"text":"This spot does lunch specials Monday to Friday until 3pm so the BF and I dropped in to try a new spot. 

There was a sign on the door for To Go Only $2 soup special.  Odd promo as I never see myself needing or thinking of getting soup to go, but I guess if you have a sick friend who suckered you into feel better supply errands get them some soup special or grab one for your favorite homeless on the corner.  

I got the Thai eggplant with pork - the flavor of the sauce was rather good and the vegetable components were all fresh (eggplant, carrots, bellpeppers). It wasn't very spicy though, you would think it was no spice that a 5 level.

BF got the massuman with beef - the meat was tender and I thought the flavor of their massuman was rather good, just the right amount of sweet which I feel tends to be what goes overboard in some places massuman base. 

Portion was fine for a lunch, came with a scoop of rice and 1 veggie eggroll. I see some people's pictures come with soup but we didn't get any. 

The one weird thing is there isn't a restroom? I wonder if you can go to the one that is in through the kitchen, but because of this each table has hand sanitizer. 

Service was just alright. We were given pitcher of water so we didn't really have someone attending to us much aside from ordering and the bill. 

The food we got was decent enough that I would try this place again, but it isn't the first on my list when I'm thinking of grabbing some Thai for lunch."}
{"text":"Friend and I ate here for dinner around 8 pm on Wed/21 Nov.

5-stars for:
- Great Thai food, nice decor.
- The $7.50 Pad Thai was a good size meal.
- Friendly service and they put a pitcher of ice water at your table (I drink a lot of H20).
- At each table is hand-sanitizer and the condiments/sauce carousel (powdered chilli, chilli peppers in white vinegar, etc).  At some other Thai restaurants you have to ask for the condiments/sauce carousel."}
{"text":"absolutely DELICIOUS !! charming little no frills spot .. 
meticulous & clean 

great lunch spot but for dinner think many would like a cold beer or wine with the very spicy thai food .. they do not serve alcohol or allow it to be brought in"}
{"text":"Having a Thai mother.. I had to take her to the best Thai food in town! My Mum loved it, and Prommares Thai has to be one of my favorite Thai places. The food is very authentic (having lived and traveled to Thailand) and is full of flavor. The Papaya Salad (\"Som Tum\"... had it had a 7... nice and spicy!) is excellent  and the grilled BBQ chicken - AMAZING! I've had the yellow curry and my husband loved it as well. It's definitely a hidden gem and if you love authentic and delicious Thai food, visit Prommares :) Being family-owned they are super friendly and there are a lot of regulars that go."}
{"text":"Dropped off my car at Toyota to get it serviced and instead of waiting, I decided to walk around to find a place to eat. Instantly I found this little Thai restaurant.

Inside was very small but very homely, with the owner friendly as can be, and decorates of Thai culture.

Decided to get my lunch favorite of which I get on a regular basis at Archie's Thai restaurant, the spicy eggplant.  I decided to get a 10 on its level of spice since I assumed it to be the same with Archie's level which I can tolerate.  Man was I wrong. Not even half way done, my nose started drippin, sweat pouring down, and lips burning, I felt as if I was the host of Man vs Food on a challenge!  

Overall my experience was good and def recommend this place if you're around this area."}
{"text":"My 100th review!  I wanted to celebrate with a solid Thai food choice!  Sorry to say, I came up empty handed :(

Quick background, I LOVE Thai food.  I have eaten Thai food all across town, and when I find a nicely reviewed one or something that is recommended to me, I put it to the test.  I LOVE spicy...I ask for \"Thai spicy\" \"phet phet\" very hot.  10/10...even after they reconfirm I actually want hot, I tell them I love spicy Thai.  I also usually order the dishes by their Thai name, so the server should know I mean business!

With that being said, my Pad Ka Pao (spicy mint chicken) was NOT hot at all.  It wasn't even slightly hot....I don't think it even got a sniffle outta me.  I am also used to them mincing up the meat, but here they do large chunks of chicken (one of the only places in town), so the meat doesn't get to absorb as much of the sauce and heat.  But still, their 10/10 was no where near a number 3-5 in the more authentic places in town.  Also, portion size is small...I got served a \"lunch special\" size I would expect at other restaurants, but at full dinner price off dinner menu.

Ordered the Pad Kee Mao (had to request it not spicy for the baby) and it was good, a lot better than the pad ka pao.   Only weird thing here is, they put bean sprouts in it!  I like bean sprouts...but not with my thai rice noodles.  It was a consistency thing here...weird biting into them hidden inside the soft yummy noodles.  Still not a bad dish though, but I have never had it this way before but won't let is affect their review.

And a small vent about paying for rice per person.  We all expect it, and we all know why they do it (more money obviously), but I wish they threw a scoop of it on the side of the dishes that need it.  I won't ding them for it since everyone does it, just kind of annoying that's all.

Other than the food, prices are a little cheaper than most but portion size is smaller (you get what you pay for), location is a hole in the wall, insides are nice and homey, but it is very small in here...maybe enough for 20 people tops.  Service was good, and I like how they have actual high chairs for the babies instead of your traditional wood plank ones.

There are many better Thai food restaurants in town.  Just drive a little more central in town."}
{"text":"4 stars for this place? Who are you kidding? This place is bad. It is super small, poor service and the food isn't anything special at all. I've had better pad thai on the side of the road in Bangkok.  This place doesn't even compare to Archi's.  If you really like Thai food, then don't waste your time eating in this place because you won't come back."}
{"text":"Looking at yelp seen peoples rate this places believe in 4 star. Guess what don't trust they rate . First time will be the last time . If I could rate this place I will rate no star at all. Order all the dish that supposed to be good it was awful. I can't believe that for the first time I have to said awful THAI food . I will not recommend anyone to come here. Thumbs down. Been to many Thai restaurant by far this is the worst place I have been . Sorry but whoever rate this place has no taste at all . Believe me this  is not taste like Thai food. The waitress here is nice but the food got to go . I suggest they need real Thai chief that can really cook . By the way we order all the dish very spicy from 1 to 10 we order 10 guess what it came out not even spicy at all what was that about . I thought thai dish supposed to be very spicy when u ask them to make it . All the dish I order don't even have chills in the dish. But really I don't recommend anyone come here . Really food is just simple nasty and have no tasty at all.  People you wanted to eat real Thai food go to one Who really know how to cook real Thai I mean really know how to cook ."}
{"text":"Great little gem in a strip mall that never disappoints. Each meal at lunch comes with a delicious bowl of soup and service is very nice and professional. Little place so not recommended for groups over 4."}
{"text":"My simple advice: The best time to visit Prommares is when you have a party of 5 or more because .40 for rice, while unexpected, is not terrible, but when you have to pay $2.00 for white rice, you might be peeved. Now that I think about it, I don't think I have ever ordered a curry dish that was not served with some portion of rice. Who eats curry without rice? However, last night, I paid $2 for white rice; it wasn't even brown. My hub ordered Pad Thai, so he didn't need the extra crab accompaniment. As a result, my $7 and change curry was effectively $9 and change.

Sadly, this will prevent me from returning, as I know I can hop in to Thai Noodle and get delicious brown rice for free with some superb curry. Rice charges are a pet peeve. It is sad because Prommares does make pretty tasty Thai. I was a little hesitant at first because they have a dish entitled \"Baby Corn\" on the menu. I have never been at a restaurant bold enough to dedicate an entire dish to these mini-ears. I proceeded with caution making sure to order my vegetable curry without baby corn. It is a yellow curry dish, and the balance of savory and sweet was great. It was a little on the thin side for my preference, but the vegetables, which ranged from Chinese broccoli to the American stuff, were fresh and generous. Then again, I didn't love the super firm tofu they served.

The interior had character, including a bathroom painted to resemble a French garden. Plus, the crooks and crannies were clean. Service was friendly enough, despite the delivery of a $2 rice pot. Man, I can't get over that. I guess you could also visit  if you're craving noodles. On that occasion, you don't need rice.  

Ultimately, I am torn here between 2 and 3 stars. I think there are better, more reasonable Thai choices in town, but I'll go with a generous three. Consider it a bonus star for cleanliness and a creative bathroom."}
{"text":"Best authentic thai restaurant in LV. The spice level was perfect. The ingredients were super fresh, service was great, great atmosphere, and prices were cheap! I was in Thailand and when I came to Vegas it was hard to digest of the thai restaurants I've been going to. My new thai place is here."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night while waiting for my car's oil change at the dealership next door. It's a tiny restaurant but the food is excellent. Love the little touches with the carved veggies. I had the Mara Nee Krob (hope I got that right). Crispy pork bites with broccoli rabe and an order of pork fried rice. Great portions and even better flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a small family owned Thai spot in a strip mall in Vegas.

A few tables are located in the small space.The people who eat here usually are Thai and are talking to the wait staff and the owner. I definitely recommend take out. 

The food here is awesome. I've never had a bad dish. This is my go-to curry joint. If you are near the area for lunch they offer a bunch of specials. 

Definitely solid, but no Lotus of Siam. No ambiance."}
{"text":"Dee-lish-uss. Eat it- eat it a lot. It's so good."}
{"text":"Been here man times, but always forget to review it. This is a good place. It is small, but it adds to the ambiance--makes it a  nice, cozy place. I like some traditional Thai decor sprinkled all about. The service is very quick, and you pretty much seat yourself. Lunch menu is a great deal, and they even serve a small, health soup before you eat, which is not advertised on the menu. I really like how the server brought me a pitcher of water without me even asking, since I drink a lot of water, I really appreciated it. 

The only negative side of this restaurant is that rice portions are small. It's like half of the typical rice portion at any other restaurant, which may be a problem with curry-type of dishes. 

Their spice level accuracy is usually pretty good, but once in a while there will be a big miss, like when I ordered bean sprout dish at spicy level 5 and received an 8. That, and a small portion of rice to soak up the spiciness really dimmed the experience that day for me. However, at least I had a full pitcher of water to wash it down and not be burning too bad :) Of course, this was just one many times I dined here, and most of the time the spices are accurate or close to being accurate.

Overall, I recommend this little family-owned Thai joint. I work really close to it and will be coming here again for either lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and quaint with limited seating. Great lunch specials. The Thai iced tea came in a huge glass mug while most places serve it in a small glass. The pad se ew on the spicy level was a 3 or 4. It wasn't over powering or gave you such a jolt your eyes would water. Fresh vegetables and chicken and the sauce wasn't to watery or thick. 

The pineapple fried rice was moist with big chunks of pineapple and cashews. Never had it with cashews they were cooked and added a nice texture to it. 

The chicken pad Thai was just as you expect. A little sweet. Nice pieces of chicken. The portions are a nice size. 
They also serve a soup with it. It had rice and morsels of tofu. 
This place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Ok..the older server was almost arguing with my friend about her mint chicken order which clearly had no mint in it... no sorry or any special compensation... weera thai down on valley view and sahara is so much better all around."}
{"text":"FWIW: This should be a 3.5.     It actually clocked in at 3.48 and I rounded down instead of up.   My apologies to the owner/staff.

So I've been here several times over the last month.  Mostly for take out, but one time I did dine in.   It really packs them in and is the smallest restaurant on Earth according to the Guinness Book of World Records.  Okay I made that up, but it's gotta be top 250.  

My usual order is the Mint Leaves and Chili lunch special with Pork (7/10 spice).  The ingredients always seem fresh and I like that they serve healthy slices of pork instead of the ground up variety.  IMO they usually spice on the lower end side of things, and a 7 rarely gives me any issues (see my Pan Asian review for the opposite experience).

The last two times I went I tried the Spicy Garlic lunch special with Pork and the Pad See Ew with Pork lunch special.  As you can tell I hate pork.   I found myself a little disappointed with each of these.  I simply wasn't crazy about the overall flavor of the Spicy Garlic dish without being able to pinpoint a specific thing wrong with it (yeah, I'm THAT good).   The Pad See Ew noodles were burnt.  I can't really say anything else about that.   

Averaging in the 4 and 5 star experiences I've had with the Mint dish I'll go 3.5 overall.  

I do need to mention one other thing:  THEY HAVE SANITIZER AT EVERY TABLE.  GERMOPHOBES REJOICE.  THE WORLD WILL SOON BE OURS.   Props for this Prommares."}
{"text":"I have to say this place makes some delish food. I ordered takeout, and it was a good thing too. The few tables they had in the dining room were all taken. 

I had the pork pad see ew and the Thai fried rice. I was a little disappointed that the pad see ew had regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli, but the taste made up for it. The Thai fried rice was out of this world. Hands down the best fried rice I've eaten in Vegas. It had lots of basil and was spiced perfectly. The portions were also quite generous, even though they were lunch specials. 

I will order from this place again for sure. They are less expensive than some of the close by Thai restaurants, but equally as good if not better.."}
{"text":"I really like the hole in the wall vibe and they provide sanitizers on the table. Will be back for more. Pad thai and service was above average. A few sweeps on the floor wouldnt hurt anyone ;)"}
{"text":"Really good lunch specials and more extensive list than other places like Archie's.  The portions are pretty decent especially the pad see ew.  Noodles are cooked well and the flavor is just right....they even make the pad see ew a little spicy compared to other places.  I think the star rating for spiciness is a little skewed....so perhaps order less stars here compared to other places.  The only down side is that they seem to get really busy during lunch and they don't have enough help....so be prepared to wait to order and wait to pay.  We had to hail the waitress down several times and even walk up to her....so if you aren't expecting stellar service and just good food, definitely another good Thai place to try."}
{"text":"Delicious! I got the chicken cashew.. my favorite.. of all thai dishes and a spicy of 6.. I normally have pretty spicy food, not extremely, but this is a good burn. Also I got the friend bananas and the mango rice.. Delicious.

PS the customer service was quick and very friendly. I will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Very yummy home style food they don't spare the spice so good can't beat a mom and pop place"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp I found this little Thai place in a strip mall in Las Vegas.  It is some distance from the Strip, but it is worth the trip.  I have gone there both of the last two times I've visited Vegas.  Both times the food was inexpensive and delicious.  The woman who owns and runs the place keeps it spotlessly clean and is quite the character.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Intimate, exceptionally clean, very reasonably priced: Prommares is a winner.
We went to 3 different places before we stumbled into this little place, it was worth it. Their papaya salad was the best, along with their satay and silver noodle soup. Great place if you are bringing a date."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. Yellow curry chicken was awesome. My daughter loved the teriyaki chicken dish. Well prepared and also delicious. Lunch served with soup and egg roll. Don't let this little strip mall restaurant fool you, as we almost didn't go in. We are glad we did and shall return!"}
{"text":"Came during my lunch break from near by CSN. I was craving something light and not expensive. I came in and it was a very cute spot--very mom and pop. 

I sat down and was given water immediately and a menu. I had their Prik King chicken dish with a side of soup.

When I got the soup first it was pretty tasty and so I ate it with a quickness. After, I got my Prik king and I was a fan on the first bite. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce was well done--not too salty and oily. The rice made is good compliment to the dish as many Asian dishes.

I would come again."}
{"text":"Amazing food. 
Very friendly. Our server even brought us soup before we ordered just as a welcome. This place is just wonderful. My husband and I were in town and had a craving for some pad thai and he found this little place on Yelp. The sheer number of positive reviews had our mouths watering and we were not disappointed. The food and pricing were perfect for us. Everything was served fresh and quickly. It was a good family made meal. We are going to be in Vegas this next weekend and cannot wait to go back and visit!"}
{"text":"Nah fuck this place. How do you deny seating a party of 9?? Just bc we had a couple balloons and one cake to celebrate a small birthday, you tell us that we should have called first and won't even seat us. Ha unbelievable. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"I've always said the best food comes from \"hole in the wall\" restaurants! This place completely delivered! The Lunch menu is less than $10 and all meals come with soup and an egg roll. 
I ordered the Chicken fried rice and it was prepared with white chicken meat. My sister ordered the Pad Thai. Both dishes were of generous portions and quite tasty! I will definitely return :)))"}
{"text":"I just went here last night after reading the reviews and wanting to go to a good family owned restaurant. 

I am not the most versed on Thai food but I'm trying. I have eat plenty of Pad Thai and Pad See-Eew. I'm am now trying new things.

As for the Pad Thai and Pad See-Eew at Prommares it is definitely the best I have had. The Pad Thai had lots of chicken and bean sprouts which I love. My GF asked for no spice so it was not spicy but still had that sweet peanuty flavor. The Pad See-Eew was loaded with Chinese broccoli and chicken. It was the best I have had yet. 

Now for the new things I was told to try by my Muay Thai instructor.

We had the TOM KAH KAI soup which is sliced chicken with coconut milk, straw mushroom, galangal, lemon grass and a touch of lime juice. WOW is the only word I had for this soup. It had so many different flavors that just blended so well together. It came out in a huge bowl for us to share. It was so much we got four servings out of it. It too was loaded with chicken. I must say not one dish we had lacked a large amount of meat.

I then tried the Beef Panang. It is a red curry cooked with coconut milk and Thai basil. I cannot compare this to others as this is the first time I had it, but I liked it so much this is my new order for whenever i go somewhere. This dish was excellent.

We had that huge bowl of soup, Pad Thai, Pad See-Eew, Beef Panang, rice, and two Thai Teas for $35. What a great deal for good sized portions of excellent Thai food.

I have been to both Archi's and Pin Kaow alot but I think I like this place better. The owner was extremely nice and I really think the family-owned type atmosphere made me feel like this place was more \"authentic\" than the other. I felt as if I were at their house for a family dinner. It was GREAT!!

Both of the other reviews are 100% accurate. Nice decor, small and intimate environment, excellent service, and GREAT food."}
{"text":"Ordered the angel wings, I've tasted better. I ordered the catfish, really good. My server was nice and polite. Definitely coming back for the catfish."}
{"text":"This was actually my first time ever eating Thai food. So I decided to come to this place after reading alot of good reviews. After walking in the decorations of the place popped out very nice this is deffenitly a whole in the wall place. I had the PAD SEE EW plate with a level 5 heat (spice). When i recieved my plate the portion size was really good. They gave me to choose how spicy i wanted it on a scale of 1 to 10 i chose a 5 the kick it had was good enough to enjoy my food without my lips burning. I like spicy food but enough to enjoy my meal. My GF had the Thai BBQ chicken plate which was surprisingly good as well. They give out a bowl of soup as an appetizer which was so good also. I give this place a solid 5stars because for being my first time eating thai food it didnt disappoint in the taste and portion size. The service was great. And for two plates and drinks i payed less than 20 which is great Because anywere you o out here in vegas there is very little places were you can have decent size portions and good food with drinks for under 20."}
{"text":"Amazing absolutely amazing. This place just destroyed all other Thai places I've ever been to. Can  not explain the kind of happy I am at this moment. Service is so friendly here. You can bring a date here and not spend so much. You want good quality food just come here. I love this place"}
{"text":"Small place; call in advance to make sure you get a table!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this Thai restaurant for over a decade. It is the best Thai food in town.  Cheap. The staff is slow but friendly.  It is a hole in the wall, so if you are pretentious, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas no questions asked. It's a tiny little hole in the wall serving delicious authentic Thai food. After traveling around Southeast Asia for 6 months I have high standards for Thai food. Their Tom Kha Kai  is out of this world and so is their green curry! I recommend this place 100% you will not be let down !"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to being in Thailand as it gets. I've never had a bad dish here after all the years of coming here. Worth every cent."}
