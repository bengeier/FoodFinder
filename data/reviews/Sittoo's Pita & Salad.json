{"text":"I had the business lunch special all I can say is Wow great price and great taste this place is going to give Aladdins a run for its money good to have another option and more affordable too!!!"}
{"text":"So glad this Lebanese restaurant recently opened in North Olmsted. They have a great variety of Lebanese food on their menu. I just had their chili and it was delicious. Very affordable casual restaurant for lunch and dinner for the whole family . I will definitely be using their catering service as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on May 13, 2017. As someone who travels to Europe for a living and experiences authentic Mediterranean foods every week, I enjoy searching for similar styles here at home in Cleveland. From the moment we walked in, we were kindly greeted, and the woman working the register answered all of our questions when we told her it was our first time here. The food quality was great, as well as the service. The restaurant is very nice inside, and very clean. We will most certainly be eating here again soon."}
{"text":"Overpriced and under quality. I could go to the Arabic store down the block and order the same thing for less than half the price of sitos, I do like the set up (hole in the wall ethnic diner) but everything else falls short, I ordered a tabouli salad and a falafel sandwich and my total was $14 outrageous. The salad had no flavor and made with subpar vegetables, the sandwich was dry and tasteless. Some people have a passion some people do it just for the money and I can tell this place does it passionless."}
{"text":"My favorite Resturant right now. I eat here at least 3 times a week. The food is amazing and it's super cheap. I hope they keep up the quality because it's the best resturant in North Olmsted right now ... The only thing that stinks about this place is the wait but it's well worth it. 

Go ... Now .... Right now"}
{"text":"Yum! A great place for a healthy fresh quick and inexpensive meal. 

I had a lunch special for $5.95 and had to get a carry out container.

Fresh juices, middle eastern favorites. The baklava is the best around."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Reasonable prices.  Very clean.  Nice looking.   Very friendly and accommodating staff.  This is a great find."}
{"text":"Some of the best lamb in the area. Great food and service. Staff is always nice. Reasonably priced dishes too. Definitely recommend if you have a craving for middle eastern food."}
{"text":"excellent food and very reasonable prices , love the fattoush and chicken grill with garlic sauce ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good prices. Had the Kafta Kabob entrée. Fresh salad, tasty meat, good rice pilaf, and tahini sauce. My only improvement would be to warm the pita that is served alongside, but it was fresh and soft at room temperature. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is a favorite local place of mine. I enjoy going to lunch there and try and schedule my lunch meetings at Sittoo's when I can. The food is authentic and yet still good to the American taste buds. If you like Mediterranean food, you will not be disappointed. The decor is also much nicer than you would expect from the view on the street."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and decided to stop after finding them on Yelp. I'm glad that I did stop. The restaurant was nice and clean and cute.  I decided to try the Sittoos combo.  It was so good and the price was decent.  I didn't have any complaints and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Being middle eastern myself, I've had plenty of middle eastern food and this place was pretty good! The meat was juicy and not dry, the rice was so flavorful and the Baba ganoush was smoky. The family owned place was super clean and the staff were very friendly. Would definitely come here again when I'm in Ohio."}
{"text":"I was impressed today by the chicken shawarma. I like to try the chicken shawarma from different Lebanese restaurants and I must say this one was one of the best I've had. I also got the grape leaves/Diwali and they pleasantly surprised me as well. I have had the hummus here often and it's good as well! 

Also mentionable was the super fast service, and friendly staff. The girl at the counter asked me about my day and we chatted for a bit while my food was being made."}
{"text":"There's a reason I keep coming back here. The food is great, service is reliable, and you can't beat the prices. 

Think Aladdin's--the same quality, similar selection, but cheaper. And waaaaay nicer people. The pita wraps are my personal favorite--easy to eat on the go (I usually stop while out grocery shopping) and packed with flavor. The tabbouleh and the hummus are both super tasty and they have above average baklava. 

You really can't go wrong here. Stop by for some Turkish coffee and a nice lunch."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go for a meal. The food is absolutely delicious and the speedy process for ordering and receiving the food is insane. It's possibly faster than a fast food drive thru. The quality is equal or dare i say, even better than their sister chain Aladdin's. I love this location, easy access, kind staff, and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. Served quickly. Great service with a smile. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Still loving the business lunch special and also tried a spinach pie this time.  Spinach pie is not what I was expecting (given the traditional Greek version).  This one was in a triangular-shaped pocket (not phyllo dough) and was filled with spinach, cheese and beets).  It was tangier than other versions I've had (due to the roasted beets, I'd imagine) but it was pretty tasty nonetheless."}
{"text":"After eating here at least 6 times in the last year, I had to go back and update to 4-stars.  Every meal has been good, the food is freshly prepared, and the wait staff always seems genuinely happy that you chose their establishment.  FYI - the chicken fatoosh salad is my go-to fav for lunch.
Great little family run resturant in a somewhat obscure strip mall.  Really good Lebanese offerings including kibbe, stuffed grape leaves, kafta pita sandwiches, and kabobs. Nothing fancy, just solid quality middle eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"I had a great lunch here! Lentil soup, chili, falafel and a spinach pie were all excellent! The decor of this place does remind me of Aladdin's but the food is better. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!! We had the spinach pie, tabouli, falafel salad and a meat wrap(hubby ate that) even the French fries were so yummy. The owner was very sweet. They do not have a bar, so he let us bring our own wine and beer to consume. We had just spent 9 hours on the road, and the staff and food were perfect before a good night's rest!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were waiting for our meal to be ready for take out. The restaurant was not busy. When our meal was ready, the worker actually repeated to us the correct order, handed us our bags and we went home. When we opened our meal, it was not the correct food. We called them to tell them about the mistake and they showed no concern. Very displeased with the service"}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! I only wish I could eat here more often. The Fattoush salad has all the flavors of home. 

Now if they would just come to Indianapolis......"}
{"text":"I love this place! The menu is great with many different options and they are open to customization. I love their hummos, and for the price, they give you a lot of it. I have had the spicy kafta sandwich and the Sittoo's Kabob sandwich and both were a great value and filling. The service is great and the staff is always happy to help, plus the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"If you want a quick lunch, and you're a fan of middle eastern food you'll appreciate this restaurant. However, the food itself is underwhelming. The staff was nice and efficient but they messed up our order-again. It's definitely a watered down version of the Lebanese/Palestinian food I've had over the years. ALSO they do NOT offer bread for a party plus 2 for free? For a double order of hummus and babaganoush but $1.25 for a 6-pack of pita? Weird. Check it out if you want a quick meal but overall not great."}
{"text":"Sittoo's has quickly become one of our favorite affordable places in the area. The food has been reliably good the number of times we've visited, and has always been cooked fresh to order. Every other week, I do a takeout lunch from the North Olmsted location, and we've eaten at and ordered takeout from the Parma location. I really appreciate that they let you customize the pita sandwiches-I cannot eat raw tomatoes, and I'm not a fan of some of the other additions like beets or turnips. I always go for their falafel pita sandwiches, and I love the home style pickles wrapped up in there! I'm a big fan of their falafel-it's always perfectly crunchy, herby without being overpowered by the herbs (I'm not a fan of falafel that's so filled with herbs it's green), and it's seasoned so tastily! My husband enjoys the beef kafta pita sandwich, and we both want to try the shishtawook sandwich soon (a favorite of mine from a Lebanese restaurant back home in NY). We also enjoy the seasoned fries, which seem to be seasoned with some form of za'atar spice. The hummus is pretty good, and the pita is pretty yummy. Pro-tip: you can buy a multi-pita package from Sitoo's cheaper than most grocery stores! The last time we went with friends, they ordered baklava and a combo, all of which looked delicious! Sittoo's is definitely worth checking out for a tasty, fast, and affordable meal! We also appreciate that the food is a fairly healthier alternative to many other options out there in a similar price point. The staff is always friendly, and the place is always clean as well. This location is the one I use for takeout for work lunch, and they are always timely!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall spot. Stopped in for lunch and the service was prompt. I ordered the fattoush with grilled chicken and it was tasty! Along with a side of hot sauce and I was very happy with it.

Overall, less expensive, but just as good as Aladdin's. We also ordered the lentil soup with chicken and that was delicious!  The decor isn't much, but for a quick lunch, it was great."}
{"text":"I have to say, I love Mediterranean food, and Sittoo's is a new find that is a definite tasty treat. 

We stopped off not knowing what to expect, and were treated to a wonderful meal of amazing hummous, chicken and lamb (which was really well done,) We even bought EXTRA hummous for home. It was really worth it. 

The service is basic but welcoming; go up front, make your order and then wait for the culinary joy to arrive at your table. It's more of a family spot, where they have abundant menu items and there's something for everyone from carnivores to vegetarians, and all of it good and affordable. 

There's a small, shared lot out front, so you should be able to find parking easily. On top of it all, the staff were nice folks who were very thoughtful and accommodating. 

All in all, for my dollar, and a large hunk of Pita, Sitto's is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. I highly recommend the spinach pie - it's soft, warm, and just the right amount of flavorful!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Sittoo's one day for lunch.  I had intended just to pull in, walk up and place my order, but the tiny, tiny parking lot was full.  I ended up parking next door at Starbucks and calling in my order.  I went in the bux for my java and tried the parking lot again at Sittoos with luck, this time.

When I stepped inside the restaurant, I felt like I was walking into a more country version of Aladdin's.  I think they may be the same family.  Very cute and quaint, this place was very clean, even on a snowy day.

I ordered a simple Fatoush salad with chicken.  It was delicious.  I was pleased with the value for my $.  I even had left-overs for a snack later that day.  

If you like Aladdin's, I think you'll be happy here at Sittoo's.  While the menu isn't as grand, there are still the staples you'll want as well as a few nice surprises (like Turkish coffee)."}
{"text":"The portions are small for what they charge. The food was cold and the manager was yelling at the cooks in front of everyone. Plus the manager advised us we had to bus our own dishes. First and last time there."}
{"text":"One of the area's best kept secrets. The friendly staff welcomes guests as though inviting them to their home. The immediate comfort is topped only by the wonderful food served here. We have discovered this restaurant only recently, but have already been back since our initial visit. Both times our dining experience has been a true treat. The house specialty is the 3-meat combination plate served with humus sauce and flat bread. Whether at lunch time or for dinner, the variety of menu items here are served in generous portions and at very reasonably prices. Sitto's has climbed to the very top of my favorite places to eat. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love Sittoo's. I usually go here for lunch about 2-3 times a week. The food is excellent, the staff is friendly, and everything is reasonably priced. I'm a customer for life. Thanks Sittoo's."}
{"text":"I love eating at Sittoo's, for many reasons. First, the people are very nice. Second, the food is excellent. In fact, I think they have the best tabouli in the area. They don't use the bulgur wheat in it, it's all parsley, onion, and tomato. The baba is creamy and smoky, just like I like it. The prices are very reasonable and the portion size is perfect. The restaurant is extremely clean - even the bathroom is kept spotless. The food is always very fresh. I feel good after eating at Sittoo's. Do try it - you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Best lebanese and Mediterranean restaurant in all of cleveland area. Clean and yummy. Prices are amazing and the service is the best. Better than Aladdins eatery. Try this place for catering too."}
{"text":"I love Sittoo's! The spicy kafta sandwich is my favorite. (Kafta is ground beef molded into a sausage shape) The entrees all come with a side of pilaf and a little salad. The meats in the entrees are always delicious and tender especially in the shish kabob. It is always ready super fast and I've never had anything I didn't like. Oh, and the pickles!! I love those pickles."}
{"text":"I started with the falafel appetizer and then had the hummus and tabouli wrap. The service was very quick, the falafel was hot the wrap was tasty. The hummus wasn't very thick, which I generally prefer, but everything was flavorful."}
{"text":"Remember when Aladdin's was new and the food was fresh and well prepared and fairly priced? Then get over to Sittoo's. This is tasty tasty food. Love the Tawook (chicken) entree, tabouli salad was gone in a flash followed quickly by the Lentil soup. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"So good! I could eat here every day! The shish tawook salad and the lamb sandwich are delicious choices!"}
{"text":"Favorite Lunchtime Spot! For less than $10 I get: falafel, lamb, beef, chicken, salad, rice pilaf, pita bread, garlic sauce and hot mint tea (that's just how I roll)! It's called the Business Lunch Special and I recommend it everyone the first time. It happens to be the ONLY thing I order because you get more than a sampling of everything, but again that's how I roll. One thing I really like is it's fuel for your body, it doesn't linger in your gut for hours or make you want to take a nap afterwards. It's delicious food, friendly staff and economical. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Great Lebanese food. Had spicy kafta sandwich. Very tasty. Portions are decent but quality is excellent. The tabouli was incredible. Very fresh."}
{"text":"Sittoo's is one of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in Cleveland that I have tried so far. I came here for lunch on a Saturday and ordered the Vegetarian combo with hummus, baba, tabouli, falafel and grape leaves.  My dining companion ordered the Sittoo's combo that came with a sampling of a few different meats. We shared both entrees and really enjoyed everything. My personal favorite was the baba ganoush but everything was extremely flavorful and presented nicely.   The service was also great, and fast! We got there a few minutes before they opened at 11:00am and they were ready to go and quick about getting our food out to us! 
Another great perk was the very reasonable prices. Each entree costs only around $7-$9! 
I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Everything about it. Friendly staff. Comfortable interiors. Amazing food, reasonably priced. Although obviously Americanized to some degree, I feel that they make a great effort at authenticity."}
{"text":"It's kinda bad that the owner and I are BFF's?? I mean I don't really know the guy in that way but I know the guy because I literally order weekly from there! Love sitoos! Great, flavorful food, on par with alladins and Taza yet price tag much better! I'm Lebanese and this is just how we make it. Nice to have one closer to home and healthy options for takeout when I don't feel like cooking!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem! I had the falafel wrap for lunch it was amazing!! Staff was very friendly, I came home to notice they threw in a whole extra bag of pita on the house! Will definatly be coming back. A+"}
{"text":"Food is very good for most of the part, but for whatever reason seems slightly less in quality compared to the Parma restaurant. My complaint isn't about the food but the service actually. They have not accepted gift cards that I bought directly from the restaurant (really don't understand that one) and have messed up our order and refused to acknowledge or fix it on multiple occasions. Like I said, the food is fine, maybe not as good as the other one in Parma, but I would travel an extra twenty minutes to the Parma location just for the service alone. That type of service I find there to be unacceptable and very unwelcoming for customers. I will not be going back to this location and be going to Parma one exclusively."}
{"text":"Love the Chicken Shawrma sandwich.  It comes as a wrap in a pita and has some awesome ingredients!  Their Hummus is the best I've had!  Much better than another local Mediterranean restaurant in the North Olmsted/Weestlake area!  Love their lentil soup too!"}
{"text":"Fresh.  Fast.  Priced right.  Lebanese food done very well.  Clean place.  Everything cooked to order.  Freindly staff.   Wow.  Food was so fresh.  Salad was crispy.  Meats were very tasty.  Great place. Value. Bringing family here for sure."}
{"text":"The proximity of Sittoo's to my workplace and the amazing array of Lebanese food that is offered here makes this a very dangerous place for my hips and my wallet! 

I came here for a group work lunch a week ago and had a hard time choosing what to get because there were so many great options. The ambiance and ordering process is a little like a Panera - you place your order at the register and then they bring out your food when it's ready.

I ended up with the Mujadara plate (that is probably spelled wrong and don't even ask me to pronounce it) which is a hot dish made of lentils, onions, herbs and other great things. A few other people got the sampler platter which I will definitely be trying next time - you get a little bit of all the best things.

The one thing that I noticed they didn't really have was dessert. I am probably being a little unfair by comparing it to the spread at Aladdin's, but all I saw at Sittoo's was a few brownies. Not that I even need dessert after my amazing meal!

Can't wait to come back here and try new things!"}
{"text":"Descent Mediterranean grub. Very affordable prices (1/2 of Alladins) but portions are also half as big. Oh America, what have you done to me, why do I always to have a portion bigger than elephants gets for dinner at the Zoo? Back to food. Pitta rolls are fresh, succulent and have that amazing grill crispness which is almost impossible to replicate at home. I like my hummus smoother but this one was quite tasty. Also if you don't want to commit to the entire waiting-on-you-for-tips deal, it's the place for you. You order the food, they bring it to you Panera-style, and you are outta there within 10-15 minutes. I say its a perfect lunch option. Don't worry, dining room is very spacious ( not one of those 9-square meters filled with smoke my-mother's kitchen look-alikes), and welcoming. For those of us who lived off stale cookies at the Starbucks next door cramming for boards for last couple of months, place is a godsend. Now everyone at Starbucks breathes coffee, happiness and pure garlic."}
{"text":"The staff is amazing and great Lebanese food! Quick, inexpensive and fresh!!! It's a must visit! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"The is a great restaurant for eat in or take out!
We visited Sittoo's for the first time last night and were so pleasantly surprised!  Just noticed it next to Starbucks and wondering what it was.  They have a nice sit-down restaurant as well as take out.  It is nicely decorated and the menu has so much to choose from.  We got the hummus, Sittoo's salads and a chicken sandwich with the garlic sauce and lentil soup.  We loved it all!  The hummus comes with some of the best pita bread I have ever had.  Loved the dressing on the salad, it is very light and not overpowering.  Staff is friendly.  Very similar to Aladdin's in Crocker but perhaps one step up."}
{"text":"I have ordered their business lunch special twice. Both orders were amazing.  A Lebanese friend suggested this place to me , said it was the best around. He was was right. Great customer service to match the food.
Sam Ute"}
{"text":"First visit to this restaurant. We visited during lunch based on Yelp reviews. When you walk in, you order at the counter and the food will be brought out to you. My first impression was good. Although I haven't visited a Lebanese restaurant, I enjoyed my meal here. 

I ordered the spinach pie and the Mujadara Entrée. My food was light and healthy. I enjoyed every bite. I would visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of weeks ago and ordered lentil soup, chicken shawarma and baklava. Everything was excellent!  I wish they had been around when I was growing up in N.O.

I wish I could get the recipe for the lentil soup...it was that good!"}
{"text":"So fresh and simply delicious. Authentic-affordable-did I say delicious? Today I had the tabouli and a fattoush salad  washed it down with cold mint tea  yummy. Other menu items have been great too. Sittoo's has been on New Day Cleveland. Business is good but it deserves to be great! Check it out! You'll go away happy and full"}
{"text":"Great food and well priced. Environment is really nice and very clean. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"What a great little secret on Lorain Rd!! It's a little hidden in a small shopping strip and I wouldn't have found it if it weren't for Yelp!  The atmosphere is great. It's comfortable, has great natural light, plenty of comfortable tables, (some booths, but mostly tables & chairs), everything looks clean and well maintained.  

The food is great!! I had a salata salad and small hummus appetiser, and a cup of hot tea...all for under $12.  And, both were huge! So large that I took half of each home.

I would definitely go there again, and can't wait to share this little gem with others!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have gotten takeout from Sittoo's on several occasions and have been pleased every time. The staff is kind, especially Tony the owner. The food always tastes fresh and is very flavorful. We've had their hummus, beef kabob, wraps, chili...all are very good. One time my chili was cold but no big deal, zapped it and enjoyed. Highly recommend, they do a great job."}
{"text":"I tried this place because I love Aladdin's but prefer eating at independent restaurants. We had a great experience, the place is clean, the staff was friendly and the food was delicious! Not to mention it was HALF the price of  Aladdin's! I have defiantly found my go-to place for Lebanese cuisine."}
{"text":"If you want real authentic Mediterranean food this is the place to come!! I love the tabbouli,  it's the best in town!! Make sure You stop in!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!! Very fresh and made with love.  If you are a fan of Alladin's - this place is even better with great prices!  Honestly I was leery going into this place not knowing what to expect- bam ... Pleasantly surprised.  I split falafal and baba with my husband - both very good!  I had the mujaddara plate- just outstanding!  My husband got hummus tabouli wrap - he was so impressed!  We took our food take out but looks like great place to sit down and eat - cozy & clean.  Friendly service!
We will be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try it because we are big fans of Aladdin's Eatery. 

First off, the outer appearance is deceiving, it's quite a bit bigger than you'd imagine. I like the family run feel. Not a fan of paying first before receiving service, but what are ya to do? 

The food was good, not as flavorful as I was expecting. I mean it had flavor, just not as strongly seasoned as Aladdins. 
Overall, we will be back. And don't forget to grab some Baklava"}
{"text":"On the cover of their menu, Sittoo's is described as a place that serves \"Grandma's traditional Lebanese recipes prepared with the finest quality ingredients.\"   Out of curiosity, I stopped in today, and am VERY glad I did!  The food is FANTASTIC, and reasonably priced.  The decor is very inviting and even a bit upscale (tiled floors), with beautiful, large paintings of old village agrarian life (presumably Lebanon?) and pastoral scenes which harken one back to a much simpler time in 'the old country'.  The dining room is very clean and inviting, with booths and tables in 2 semi-divided dining areas.  There are even some beautiful old rustic pieces of furniture lining the main entrance.  Sittoo's looks like they spent a lot of time and effort decorating their restaurant, and it shows.  The take-out area is nice too, with ample seating and a wooden bench where you wait for your food, prepared on the spot.  They either bring your food to your booth/table, or you pick up at a counter (like a Panera's) and seat yourself.  Very nice!  I ordered a Shistawook Sandwich (char-grilled chicken strips, veggies, and garlic sauce wrapped in a pita),  Spinach Pie, and Baklava, and all tasted great!  The chicken was very juicy with no fat.  They even have a kids menu, so I will be back with my wife and child next time.  It's nice to see a place like Sittoo's come to this area and provide a variety of food options that we so desperately need!  LOVE this place!  

UPDATE:  I have some constructive criticism for Sittoo's.  I've been here a few times already, and have only 1 minor issue regarding their Kid's Meals.  The chicken kid's meal and kid's fries were not liked at all by my daughter and her best friend.  They (as most kids do) expected lightly fried and breaded American style chicken strips and crunchier, plain fries without lemon and spices added.  Sittoo's kid's chicken strips were broiled or baked and topped with spices that the kid's didn't like at all!  They would have also liked a chicken and fries combo option, and didn't care for the hummus.  Personally, I liked them, but try and get a fussy 8 year old to eat something new and/or healthy!  FUGGEDABOUDIT!"}
{"text":"Very good. Loved the Sitoo combo and babaghanoush was very fresh! Would definitely come back. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant after seeing it open in North Olmsted, but the food was just okay - not as good as a couple other places we really love for similar options. 

The husband had a beef kafka dish that he said was good, but thought the portion was a little smaller than other restaurants. 

I had a mujadara pita that was SO SMALL it never would have filled me for a meal. I was shocked at how tiny of a sandwich this was, and let me tell you, I am NOT one for large portions. I tend to bring home leftovers from restaurants and I almost never finish pita sandwiches at other similar establishments. Good thing I also ordered an appetizer of falafel. It was good falafel. 

The menus was smaller than other similar places as well, but the staff working was friendly. 

Probably won't go back...not with living so close to our other similar favorites."}
{"text":"One of the best Mediterranean restaurants on the Westside of Cleveland!  Lots of flavor!"}
{"text":"Favorite Lebanese restaurant - baba ganoush is the best around, hot sauce is amazing and the chicken is really flavorful. The place is always spotless and service is good!"}
{"text":"One of the best lunch spots that I've ever been to. They have a large menu to choose from, but at lunch they have a \"businessman special\", that includes kafta, chicken,  lamb patty, salad and rice for only 5.99! An amazing value.

The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. Overall, a surperb establishment."}
{"text":"Food is awesome and not expensive.  Best kept secret in North Olmsted. I love the Shwarma"}
{"text":"Every thing was just ok, Yelp is usually spot on but not this time.....chicken was under seasoned and a very small portion , salad was fresh but too much dressing, hummus was average and pita was not very soft, Dolce Wraps is waaaayyy better or even Aladdin's...when I left I was still hungry..disappointed"}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are very friendly, the prices are good and it didn't take long for them to bring me my order. Highly recommended. A hidden treasure in North Olmsted for sure"}
{"text":"I picked up takeout with my mom and husband a few days ago. I ordered the shish tawook sandwich, which was very good. My mom ordered the falafel and my husband the lamb. My mom's lemon was a bit overpowering. Overall the sandwiches were good for the price, but were kind of small. I would rather pay $1-2 more and get a bigger sandwiches. I also wish they had a combo meal."}
{"text":"Fast friendly knowledgeable staff, adequate portion size, very tasty and fresh, prices are in line with the portion size, at least with the Chicken Shawarma entree I had. And I can't remember the last time I was in a restaurant as clean as this one, even the restroom was spotless. A++ staff, I can tell you are dedicated and work very hard!!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the good. The restaurant looked clean, and the food was reasonably priced and it tasted fine. But not much more than alright.

I ordered a lamb wrap and a vegetarian combo for take-out. Both totaling only slightly over $12. A great price considering it was going to be my food for the entire day. Plus, it was ready in the amount of time they had said which I suppose is another good point. 

So I get the food back to the hotel and it all looked great except that the wrap was quite small, and the lamb was not in chunks as most of the other mediterranean spots I frequent but rather it was ground and formed into something of a meat patty and cut into strips. Hmmm...odd? or maybe just me? The meat was well seasoned but it resulted in a texturally one note kind of wrap. I wish the menu would have specified that it is ground lamb but it doesn't (I double checked). If all the wraps are similarly sized make sure you get something in addition to a wrap because just the sandwich won't likely fill you up.

I made sure to taste one of the falafel while they were hot to be able to accurately access them, and while good I wouldn't put them in the top 50% of falafel that I have tasted. Perhaps a 3 on the Yelp scale. The hummus was just ok, the baba was good, but again not in the top ranks, the tabouli lacked much flavor, moisture or zing, the grape leave stuffing was kind dry or undercooked, I couldn't tell which. 

The food was edible and filling (eating it throughout the day) but other than the ground lamb it was pretty bland and none of it made me even close to going \"MMMMMMMM\". I will probably skip it the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Standard Lebanese food options.  All the normal choices were present on the menu.  Serving sizes were a bit smaller than normal, but the food was average. 

Price was fair for the food provided, but overall this was not up to par in contrast to my experience with Lebanese restaurants."}
{"text":"Clean, ample seating, well decorated.  Food is fresh, delicious and priced well.  Owner is the chef.  Service was friendly.  Really great place all around.  I drive past it on Lorain Rd all the time and finally stopped in for dinner, very glad I did.  Will be back for sure probably to try their lunch special which appears to be a deal for all that you get."}
{"text":"To put it simply...excellent! It is very similar to Aladdin's and also La Kabob.  The prices are phenomenal, the food is fresh, and the place was very clean!"}
{"text":"First time tonite, grilled chicken sandwich, lamb sandwich, dawalli and assorted baklava..oh my, could eat this every day. Delicious, seasoned, tender and juicy!"}
{"text":"The friendliest family runs this restaurant. The cleanest restaurant I've ever seen. Even the ice machine at the soda fountain is crystal clear! Fresh ingredients, traditional Lebanese cuisine. The prices are very reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"When I pulled in the parking lot I got the last spot at lunch yesterday.  I probably wouldn't have tried the place if there wasn't a parking spot available.  You walk in and place an order at the counter.  You are given a number and someone brings food to your table.  Drinks are self serve.

I ordered a fattoush salad with an appetizer order of falafel.  With a bottle of water the total came to around $12.  The food here was made to order fresh and arrived at my table when ready.  So the salad and falafel arrived separately.  I like that.  Get it when its ready so it isn't sitting around.

The portion sizes were perfect.  Fresh tomato, onion,cucumber, scallion, lettuce, parsley was mixed in with a tasty, tart dressing.  The pita chips were plentiful and seemed baked rather than fried.  But I could be wrong.  There was a healthy dose of sumac on top as seen in the picture as it was also mixed into the salad as well.  It was delicious.

Falafel were not too big and not too small.  I found them just right.  Crunchy exterior.  Soft interior.  It was a good example of a falafel.

I enjoyed my visit.  The staff was super nice and I will definitely be back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sure that our take-out choices were rare off-dishes for Sitto's, considering their impressive star power both here and at their Ridge Road location.  Just bad luck.

But four disappointments out of four were never expected.  Unsure if we'll try them again.  Too bad, since these were likely not typical results.

FRENCH FRIES
I wanted to try zatar.  Because the woman over the phone said that they sprinkle it on their fries, I ordered them.  Before purchasing this expensive seasoning, I'd be able to taste it first.  But because very little was used---the finest of dusting over only a few of the fries---any zatar flavor was nearly non-existent.   If it's naturally mild, much more should have been used.  I still don't know what zatar tastes like.  Fries themselves were pale, soft, and limp, needing hotter oil that would have browned them a bit and made them at least somewhat crisp.

MUDJADARA ENTREE
From their menu,\"Steamed lentils and rice, topped with Lebanese salata and fried onions.\"   Salata and rice were fine, however the lentils were firm and dry, barely beyond the raw stage.  Needed maybe another 5-6 minutes?  Not sure how  long, since I've never prepared mine this way---always simmered in broth or water.  Regardless, no one checked if they were done (soft and tender) before serving.  About one tablespoon of onions.  Maybe they ran out. 

FALAFEL PITA SANDWICH
Bland, way under-seasoned.  OVER seasoned would have been worse, but these were definitely missing the flavor of any necessary ingredient expected in falafels.  If those typically-used components WERE added, cooks were too light-handed. Pita, tahini-lemon sauce, and other veggies were fine.  

SHISTAWOOK PITA SANDWICH 
Too meager an amount of chicken for a one-person-sized sandwich, but shared by two for a first visit sampling.   Accompanying vegetables were likely okay, but impossible to tell since the garlic in the garlic sauce had been burned, permeating every bite with intense bitterness.  Burned garlic.  Among the worst mistakes in the kitchen.  Anyone who has experience preparing dishes with it knows that sauteed or roasted garlic doesn't require tasting to know immediately.  If it has become dark brown, you've gone too far.  I love garlic---a staple that I always have on hand---and know that once the damage has been done, it's irreversible. This batch should have been thrown out before other ingredients were added, and a new sauce started.

Having the highly-rated following that Sittoo's has, I can't imagine that these beginner mistakes were made by regular, experienced employees---unless they were way understaffed or rushed that day.  Or maybe newly-hired or untrained kitchen workers were responsible. 

Anyone who enjoys Lebanese foods---or has never tried them, but would like to---should check out Sittoo's.  We just happened to visit on a likely rare off-dish day.

{"text":"I've had sittoos twice before and really enjoyed it. No negative reaction, just a nice meal. Overall friendly waitstaff. Last night, my boyfriend and I were short on time so I suggested we take out from there. He hadn't had sittoos before but has tried what we ordered before and has a stronger stomach than I do. At about 4am we started experiencing stomach pains, by 5am he was puking with a migraine and I was in the bathroom. We woke up this morning with sweats and chills. All he had to eat that day aside from Sittoos was his usual homemade breakfast sandwich (and I checked, none of the ingredients were expired) I hadn't eaten anything yet. I called the restaurant this morning, was transferred to I assume the manager, and was told there is no way it could've been from there because we ordered vegetarian...guess what, vegetables, nuts, and beans can all go bad too. In fact, the manager did not even apologize, even after I explained that was all we had, and just denies any possibility that it was their food. I wasn't looking for a refund or freebie, but he didn't even offer one, just denied all accountability when I was just trying to let them know about the issues to prevent it from happening to someone else. AND THEN HE HUNG UP ON ME. Hung up. I will NOT return, and I will make sure none of my family or friends return. The food was one thing, but the distinct lack of customer service disgusted me even further."}
{"text":"This place is so great in my opinion. I've always frequented their location in Parma, but never had the chance to visit this one until recently. It's a bit larger than the Parma location, very spacious and extremely clean (even the restrooms were spotless!). Their menu is large, but not as large as their competitor Aladdin's. I have always preferred this place to Aladdin's however, as it's significantly cheaper and I've personally enjoyed the food here more. I typically get one of their pitas filled with grilled meat and veggies, and I always compliment them with their sauces: garlic sauce, tahini sauce, and hot sauce. Each one is delicious, and I especially love dipping the fries seasoned with zataar seasoning in the sauces. My friend also got the business special, which was a wonderful array of falafel, pita, salad, grilled meat and rice for less than $6. I will also add that their iced tea is fresh brewed and fantastic. I've always found everything here to be very fresh and great quality, and the service has always been more than friendly. I would definitely more than recommend to others to give it a try, you're sure to find something on their menu that you'll enjoy and there's plenty of healthier options."}
