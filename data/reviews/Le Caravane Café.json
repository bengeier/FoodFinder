{"text":"Super cute place but slowest service EVER! Don't come here unless you have a full day to spend waiting for your (small & simple) order"}
{"text":"What an absolute gem. This is my second trip to Montreal. I set out to find a nice little café with wifi and some food. The atmosphere seems to mostly be students with friends. At lunch it becomes crowded but still friendly and relaxed. My French is not so good but the staff was patient and helpful in English and French. The food was amazing! L'envie and most sandwiches come with a fruit salad and potatoes. Everything was fresh. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Update: They added lots more space, and a terrace! Yay!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, coffee and food! The food presentation is lovely and the taste is even better!  We will return often and look forward to bringing our out of town guests!"}
{"text":"Endroit idéal pour étudier ou travailler sur son ordinateur. Tables profondes qui permettent de bien s'installer.   Le prix des plats est très raisonnable. J'ai mangé les mignonnettes: 3 ufs cuits au four avec bacon + Bonne quantité de fruits frais + Salade verte au vinaigre et huile + Baguette et confiture + Un petit café latté pour 11.50$  Vraiment contente d'avoir trouvé cet endroit j'y reviendrai!"}
{"text":"Very cozy, lots of seating, delicious and well priced coffee, with great options for brunch and quick bites. I love the outdoor seating. If you are in the area it is a must see.   I don't speak French so the only French menu was hard to navigate but the ladies at the front are beyond helpful and sweet. I feel so lucky to have been staying close to Caravane during my stay in MTL! Will be coming back"}
{"text":"This place was awful.  It was around 9:00pm and my friend and I were in the mood for some coffee and a little treat so we skimmed through the Internet (and Yelp) and found this cafe, with great reviews might I add. We decided to try it out.   We arrived to find the street completely under construction blocking the entrance to the cafe, not that this was their fault, but they could have put up a sign to direct us rather then us climbing over the gate to enter. We walked through the front and entered the cozy but extremely warm cafe.   I noticed on the way in that the majority of the customers were Arabic and or Indian.   We stood at the counter and wandered the small menu quickly before deciding on a cappuccino, a hot chocolate, a slice of pecan pie and a cookie. The cashier, who seemed to be under the influence of something, was very hard to understand and was having even more difficulty understanding us. We went outside to wait but found the chairs extremely uncomfortable, so we decided to go back inside regardless of how hot it was inside. We waited for our food, which we were told would be brought to the table, patiently. Once ready, the cashier called out our order from the cash and waved us over so that WE could come pick it up. I was a little annoyed to have to make two trips with the HUGE plates that were given, not to mention the portions were small.   Let's just say it was a first and a last visit for us."}
{"text":"Great service.  Gentleman who waited on me was very polite and patient. The atmosphere is very relaxing. Almost feel asleep on couch. At the time of my visit there were a lot of students working in their laptops and a lot of in and out traffic of people passing by to grab a beverage. Bathroom was in decent shape all things considered but not spotless. Wifi also tested at about 6gbs.  I see myself being a regular here."}
{"text":"Okay place for breakfast not the biggest menu the sandwich i had was good but the potatoes i ordered had a large piece of wood in it. When i told the people working there they took the piece and came back to the table with some cheap madeleines that looked store bought. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, the service was friendly, the portions were perfect, and the general ambiance was so cute! Coming in as tourists from America, this is by far the best bfast/brunch/lunch places I've been too! You won't be disappointed:) !!!"}
{"text":"C'est selon moi le café le plus sympathique de l'arrondissement Côte-des-Neiges. Pour les étudiants et étudiantes des écoles avoisinantes, c'est très facile d'y accéder à pied et c'est l'endroit parfait pour un travail en équipe ou pour réviser seul. Le décor est super et l'ambiance est géniale.  Le menu est simple et exquis. De bons grilled cheese, de bonnes salades et des desserts à vous en faire saliver.  Moi qui suis une adepte des cafés latte, je ne manque pas une occasion d'en commander un. Excellent, mais pas constant. J'ai été déçue à une ou deux reprises par son goût fade, et d'autres fois j'en aurais pris un deuxième. C'est le seul point qui fait que le Caravane Café ne se mérite pas la note parfaite."}
{"text":"Mon café préféré en ville ! Le rapport qualité prix est très intéressant, les serveurs et serveuses sont accueillant et l'ambiance pour étudier est extra ! Leurs sandwichs au bleu et au chèvre sont définitivement à tester ! Par contre, pensez à venir tôt pour avoir une place assise car ça café est souvent victime de son succès."}
{"text":"Warm, charming and inviting Le Caravane Café gives you a buzz, in a good kinda way, not just from caffeine but from the energy that this place emanates!  Open from 7am to 11pm during the week and 9am to 11pm on weekends, this café has soul and a beat that never seems to stop! Drowning in a sea of pen & paper, notebooks, pads, mobile devices, you'll see students studying, heads down with headphones, some others are chatting away and others are furiously working on group projects. This said, not to worry, you're almost always assured to find a spot to sit as there seems to be a decent amount of turnover.  Surrounded by vintage elements such as tape reel typewriters, tungsten light fixtures, beautiful woodwork, I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic but then snap right back when noticing the modern power outlets essential to fuel our highly coveted electronics.  Needless to stay I stopped by for a yummy cup of joe and could not resist to the callings of the decadent chocolate chip cookie that was gazing at me as I was being served by a very charming and friendly barista. I am told that the breakfast, sandwiches and soups are all very tasty not to mention very reasonably priced too!   Congrats Karim and Valérie for opening this little haven for UofM patrons! I'm intrigued by how you've helped Côte-des-Neiges blossom and will return to try out the ratatouille and perhaps a classic Jambon & Emmental cheese melt!"}
{"text":"It was a rainy Monday morning, so we decided to visit Le Caravane, thinking maybe it wouldn't be so crowded. My partner had gone here a couple times before but I was a newbie. She had mentioned it was a nice place to do work, and the food menu was promising.   So we arrive and... the place is full. Luckily we managed to vulture up a half of a table in the back. Not how I prefer to do things, but we lucked out.   We check out the menu and alas, it's all in french. Which I understand, but this causes a dilemma for me as the still-learning-french person in the crew. So I just went with the item that I could actually read and understand, the Brie avocado Bacon Benedict. Seemed safe enough.   We grab our coffee (solid, by the way) and take our seats. I attempt to connect to their wifi and... no luck. I had the correct password but for some reason this happens with spotty wifi setups. Oh well, guess I'll have to send that attachment when I get home.   Maybe that was a sign that I should just get off my laptop. I put it away and the food arrives. Luckily for me, the Benedict was delicious. It came with a salad and a baked potato kinda thing (which I wasn't a fan of but it did the trick).   Somewhat inconvenient, but I probably would come back to Le Caravane if I came super early so I could secure a seat and hopefully a wifi connection. The Benedict was a plus, the coffee was good, and I look forward to trying the other items."}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop in the neighbourhood. It has an awesome hipster vibe, with delicious viennoiserie, great coffee, and an amazing loose leaf tea selection. It's a very popular place to go study and it has a large terrasse. The staff are very friendly to boot!"}
{"text":"Alright, alright! My girlfriend and I were looking for some Saturday morning brunch, and we came here on a whim.   You'll notice immediately upon entering the café how cozy it is. Considering its close proximity to University of Montréal, I suspect this is a great place for studying. Many people had their laptops and notebooks out, so you wouldn't be out of place if you wanted to do some work here.  The café has a very peaceful vibe, and the staff were amiable. The coffee prices were decent, and their brunch options were great. I love Eggs Benedict, and I will almost always order one whenever it is offered. I had \"Le Paresseux\", and I was surprised at how generous the portions were for the price. As you can see in my photos, there was the Eggs Benedict, a salad and a side of potatoes. The salad was surprisingly delicious, and really well seasoned. One of my eggs were a little overcooked, but it was alright.  I also ordered a cappucino, which was decent, even if it was a little weaker than I'm used to.   There were, however, a few flies that tried to get between me and my food. Despite this, Caravane Café is a great place to grab brunch or to get some work done. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place during our visit to Montreal. We were on the hunt for something to eat late at night and this was one of the few places around that was still open. It seemed however that they had either stopped serving food for the day, or had run out of everything. Disappointed and hungry, we left. But, we were all so impressed with the atmosphere of this cafe that our group agreed to come back for brunch at least once during the visit. Housed in a building that was a former home, this cozy little cafe makes you feel like you're just hanging out in your friend's living room. The decor is a nice touch. One thing I was a fan of right away: this place actually had bold, iced, black coffee. (It is a personal pet peeve of mine when the only iced coffee that's available is cold brew, call me a coffee snob!) This place is a good choice for a healthy brunch. I tend to favor a heartier morning meal, but if I wanted to opt to eat on the lighter side I would go with this place. The staff is very friendly and helpful, coffee was good, great atmosphere and good place to get some work done if you wanted to bring your laptop - saw plenty of available plugs."}
{"text":"Pretty good place to hang out, great atmosphere and a nice terrace outside to drink your coffee and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Nice coffee shop right next to Université de Montréal, the other day, I ordered a cappuccino and a madeleine, and they were both excellent. The coffee had a nice balance between the milk based sweetness and the tartness and roast of the coffee. The madeleine was buttery and tasty.  The location is always packed, however, they have great wifi, really comfortable lighting, comfy chairs, and mural plugs for the laptops. This is a very great representation of a republic of laptopistan, where people work away on the computers while sipping coffee. I would highly recommend this place for a quick bite next to the University, some coffee and dessert date, or just to work on your papers. Great place."}
{"text":"The cafe itself is fairly normal however, the service is horrendous. Walked into the cafe on a Friday evening, it was mostly empty, there was one person at the cash who was chatting away on the phone while carefully ignoring customers. I decided to leave after waiting for a few min as the staff chose to not acknowledge anyone who might be interested in purchasing something. On my way out overheard other patrons voicing their unhappiness with the service which means this probably wasn't a one-off occurrence. Would not recommend, Starbucks on Cote Des Neiges is a far better option with helpful staff."}
{"text":"I don't come here as much as I'd like (because it's way far away from my part of town) but whenever I'm in Côte des Neiges I stop by. The food is great, I think it's reasonably priced. Sandwiches, soups and salads. Definitely enough pastries to satisfy. Coffee is amazing. Service is good. Ambiance is outstanding - I really love their outdoor seating in the nice weather. And I love love love that they do Kusmi's organic Lov tea. Switch up your coffee for a tea sometime - it will not disappoint.  Lots of great space for sitting - you can see why it's a favorite for students in all seasons."}
{"text":"Perfect for studying. Many people just put their laptop and study or work. So you dont feel awkward . In the same time, it's really good place to chill with friends. Cozy interior and peaceful vibe. I think I can always have great brunch with my friends.  One of my fav cafe in montreal.   P.s their Key Lime pie is soooo good. My tongue feel orgasm. Lol I dont really leave comments or review but this pie made me write this although Ive come this cafe for many times."}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour manger un sandwich (leur sélection est variée et délicieuse), et le décor en vaut la peine. Difficile de trouver une table par contre, et le café n'est pas excellent. Le café du Méchant Café juste en face est de loin supérieur. Sandwich au Caravane, puis traversez au Méchant pour un café!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is amazing!!! I am a huge fan of independent coffee shops with rustic mismatched interiors and a casual ambiance.. this place fits that description perfectly.  After visiting the St Joseph Oratory, I was in need of a cuppa and found this place on Yelp. We decided to walk there which took about 10-15 minutes. From the exterior, I knew I would love this place and the Yelp reviews definitely do it justice.  We ordered goat cheese sandwich with caramelized onions and chutney, cookie dough cheesecake, tea and mocha. The mocha was delicious as was the sandwich but the cheesecake was to die for! I would go again just for that, it was perfection on a plate mmm!! The cookies and other desserts also looked delicious, need to try them all! If only it wasn't so far from home :("}
{"text":"J'adore étudier au Caravane Café. Tout près de l'Université de Montréal, c'est un endroit génial pour les étudiants qui ont besoin d'un petit lunch ou d'une boisson chaude pour se motiver. Les panini sont excellents et le café est bon. Toutefois, si vous êtes un fan d'espresso qui donne des sensations fortes, ce n'est peut-être pas l'endroit pour vous. Décor charmant, serveurs attentionnés, ambiance agréable à toute heure... et comment résister à un bol de café au lait en étudiant dans l'espoir de ne pas échouer la majorité de nos cours? Merci, Caravane Café."}
{"text":"Endroit chaleureux et convivial, mais bondé d'étudiants venus pour travailler, du coup c'est très difficile d'avoir une place (en tout cas, le jour où on y est allés mes 5 amis et moi).  Sinon l'établissement est vraiment sympathique, la déco est cool et on s'y sent plutôt bien. On a goûté aux pâtisseries, j'ai pris le cheesecake brownie, il était bon, mais pas forcément le meilleur que j'ai goûté non plus. Dans l'ensemble c'était quand même très bon. Un endroit qui me donne envie, pourquoi pas, d'y retourner pour un goûter entre ami."}
{"text":"Le Caravan Café, j'en avais déjà beaucoup entendu parlé de la part des étudiants et étant à quelque pas de chez moi je me dis: Go, il est temps de tester ça !   J'arrive, je trouve le décor directement sympa, attirant et chaleureux ! Le tout en bois, façon vintage, tableaux stylés (pas du style Ikea non), quelques vieilleries comme une machine à écrire.   J'y ai passé plusieurs heures lors de ma période d'examen, j'ai donc eu l'occasion de tester plusieurs choses, notamment les ufs bénédictines, dont je ne suis pas fan à la base, mais là, première bouche et waw je me régale, je vous conseille le Coquet à base de shutney de figues, ce qui amène la parfaite petite touche de sucrée, le tout accompagné d'une belle salade et d'une purée comme celle de maman ! Quantité et qualité assurée pour un prix dérisoire.  J'ai également testé l'un de leur sandwich, c'était bon et frais également mais pas assez garni selon moi.   Ils ont aussi un vaste choix de boissons chaudes ou froides, ainsi que différent choix de gâteaux, dont j étais un peu sceptique à première vue, mais au final j'ai goûté une petite bouché, je m'attendais au gâteau industriel et pas du tout, ça goûte le fait maison !   Personnel agréable, souriant et de bon conseils. De plus, ils disposent d'une belle terrasse, de quoi profiter lors des belles journées ensoleillées !   Bref, on y retourne quand vous voulez que ce soit pour étudier, pour petit-déjeuner ou encore bruncher !"}
{"text":"Great coffee, not ideal to study because of the loud music and the lack of light. Food is delicious and reasonably price. Best To go upstairs for some peace of mind."}
{"text":"TLDR: Cosy cafe with great chai lattes  I've frequented this cafe twice now, and it's now my go to place when I need to get some work down or want to grab a coffee with a friend or first date.  On both occasions, I went with the chai latte. The barista was kind enough to inform me that if I do not want the boxed version I can have one made from tea bags. It was nice and warming on the cold winter night, and fitting to my surroundings.  The atmosphere is cosy with mismatched chairs and tables, and there is a lot of space in the home converted to a cafe.  They also have a workspace upstairs. For #3/hour for a max of $10, you can sit, drink coffee/tea, and get your work done for as long as your heart desires. I have yet to check it out , but I look forward to when I do.  Overall, a great place :)  P.S. Don't forget to visit the bathroom where there are plants growing in the bathtub!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I do not drink coffee.  If I were you, my next question would be, \"why is this person reviewing a café?\" and I wouldn't blame you!  Le Caravane Café is a really nice place located on Lacombe on the corner of Gatineau, right around the corner from Cote Des Neiges metro.  Though I don't drink coffee, I love any place that is open until 11 PM and serves food and excellent desserts.  I don't know if the term exists, but this place is basically the quadrifecta for me: open late, check; serves dessert, check; vegetarian food options, check; serves milkshakes!!??  OK, where do I sign?  Please take my money!  Add to that the fact that the staff is always friendly and welcoming, and i think they're starting to recognize me even though I've only been there a few times.  This kind of personal touch goes a long way with me.   Now to the important bits, here are my recommendations for things not to be missed if you visit:  The salted caramel and white chocolate chunk cookie is a classic crowd pleaser here, and is well worth trying.  The caramel saltiness is a perfect complement to the sweetness of the cookie and the white chocolate chunks.  Your taste buds will thank you, trust me.  The White Chocolate Brownie Cake!  The White Chocolate Brownie Cake!!  The White Chocolate Brownie Cake!!!  Oh My God!!!!!  Words cannot describe the decadence of this cake.  When I first saw it, I was drawn hypnotically to the words \"brownie\" and \"white chocolate\" but I ordered it with some trepidation because it looked like a cheesecake, and I don't like cheesecake.  I could not have been more wrong - what appeared to be cheese filling was actually a white chocolate mousse, permeated with brownie bits!  Topped with a mini brownie, and all of this on a base of brownie, I think I died and went to heaven, then I came back so I could do it all again!  Try a sandwich!  So far I've tried the grilled vegetables and the tuna and avocado, and they were delicious!  I can't wait to get there earlier enough someday to be able to get an Eggs Benedict, that'll be my next review.  Have a smoothie!  There's a choice of around 8 different fruits, but don't be afraid to mix and match.  My favourite is Banana, Mango, and Pineapple.  I tried Banana, Mango, and Peach, but it was a little too sweet (a part of me just died for saying that, but it's true).  Check out the bathroom (not in a weird way!), they've converted a bathtub into a planter with a few different trees, I got a real kick out of that!   Le Caravane Café!  I can't wait to go back! See you there, maybe ;)"}
{"text":"This place is definately awesome ! Not only I won points bringing my wife here i myself enjoyed it so much ! The mocha is the real deal ! We ordered a goat cheese sandwhich with caramelised onions and fruit chutney, the bread was a ciabatta type and the ingredients inside were just so fresh, authentic and tasty! But the foodgasm was hidden in their mini cookie dough and cheese cake ! One is not enuff (thats how good it is and you cant stop eating it) i recommend it !! Despite beeing a very busy cafe the noise level is very low and i enjoyed it so much ! Will come back for sure ! Ps : its walking distance from Oratoire st Joseph :)!"}
{"text":"An excellent little coffee shop slash restaurant that I had the chance to visit a few times with my husband and friends. I would add that in my opinion, they serve one of the best coffee in the neighborhood.    Service so far has always been amicable. Café Caravane also has a good selection of food including fresh sandwiches, as well as some vegetarian options.  The interior is decorated with colorful revolutionary and political art, adding to the welcoming atmosphere. Wooden chairs and tables are mismatched but all very comfortable. Prices are fair and the food is affordable.  Overall a nice place I would recommend in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved Le Caravane Cafe ! Its an adorable coffee shop not only with their decor inside but also with a really pretty outdoor patio (with lots of room). Its a really nice place for a date or to catch-up with a friend !  The staff was very warm and welcoming , which is always a plus.  I had their ice latte (super refreshing , great taste to the coffee and nice portion size) and their Cherry Cheesecake. I'm super picky about cheesecake and honestly this one was soooo soooo good (creamy, not overly sweet, great cherry topping without being overkill) ! They have a lot of different cakes and pastries to choose from , all of which looked delicious so be prepared to make some tough choices when you get there !  They also have some savory food options if you don't have a sweet tooth. Great atmosphere ,  great desserts and coffee , reasonable prices and friendly efficient staff , what more can you ask for ? Definitely worth giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Nice retro-styled cafe and brunch place. I ordered egg benedict on salmon. The eggs were a little over poached but the food still tasted very good. The salmon and fruits were fresh.   You need to pay before eating. Order at the cashier then they will take the food to you. This place is usually very full, so go early in the morning."}
{"text":"À deux pas du métro Côte-des-Neiges, et juste assez en retrait du boulevard pour avoir un feeling de quartier résidentiel.  Je n'ai visité ce café qu'en formule \"café + dessert\", alors je ne peux pas vous renseigner sur leurs options de repas du déjeuner. De toute manière, ils semblent se démarquer surtout par leurs ufs à la bénédictine, et je n'en mange pas/n'aime pas ça. Je ne suis pas à court de choix cependant devant leur COMPTOIR DE DESSERTS. Ouh la la. Selon moi, ça rivalise le bon vieux Rockaberry pour les parts de gâteau au fromage. Toutes les saveurs que j'ai essayées jusqu'à présent sont succulentes.  Je ne peux pas vraiment mettre le doigt sur la raison pour laquelle je ne suis pas plus excitée par ce café. Je n'ai pas d'amélioration à suggérer, c'est bête. À vrai dire, je pense que je sais, mais c'est loin d'être un problème, c'est juste que je ne \"fitte\" pas. Je m'explique: c'est un café où les étudiants vont relaxer et... étudier. C'est à la fois parfois trop animé pour que j'aie envie d'y lire, et parfois trop calme pour que je me sente à l'aise d'y tenir une discussion animée. Je ne m'y sens pas à l'aise, mais j'insiste pour souligner que ça n'a rien à voir avec l'accueil que j'y ai reçu.  Pour finir sur une note plus positive, l'endroit est aussi joli de l'extérieur qu'à l'intérieur. La machine à écrire à l'entrée donne le ton de la décoration, les bibliothèques garnies de vieux livres sont cool aussi. Ça tranche avec le look un peu mainstream maintenant des cafés troisième vague, tous très blancs/avec des accents de bois naturel/épurés."}
{"text":"Fast. Friendly. Delicious.   Came here with a few friends for a late brunch. When we got to the register, there were two minutes left in their breakfast menu, so I quickly ordered the brie, bacon and avocado benedict. It was absolutely delicious. They were out of mashed potatoes before I got there, which is not a big deal because they subbed it out for some fruit.   We ate outside in the sunshine but the interior looked like a great place to grab a coffee or a meal and catch up on some homework.  I'm surprised this place doesn't have more reviews but I was thoroughly satisfied with my meal and the staff was extremely friendly as well."}
{"text":"cool vintage cafe near University of montreal and mount royal. The Owner is very creative if you see the sewing machine on the stand and check their washroom"}
{"text":"Une place vraiment cosy et sympatique avec de très bon sandwichs. Le staff est très attentif et répond au doigt et à l'oeil."}
{"text":"Espace bien pensé pour les étudiants avec une bonne qualité de nourriture. Le prix du brunch est très raisonnable et après on a plus faim."}
{"text":"Went there twice for brunch.   The prices are fair. I got two eggs benedict with a salad+fruit and mashed potatoes.  The first time, the potatoes were a bit bland. The salad was good and my eggs were a little overcooked.  The second time, everything was good!  They give good portions!  I don't know if they read our reviews and fixed it or if was luck, but everything tasted a lot better than the first time.  However, the place is quite cramped. When people passed between tables, they had to turn sideways and they'd still rub against the tables. There were also flies flying around both times and it was quite annoying to have to shoo them away constantly.   The proximity of the tables didn't create any sense of privacy.   Overall, it serves good food for fair prices, but the way the café was set up didn't appeal to me. The flies really bothered me. If I didn't have to shoo them the whole time I was eating, I would probably have enjoyed myself more."}
{"text":"If you want to eat, if you want to study you can't wish about a better place. The music is  good, the wood on the walls give a close atmosphere, the waiter and the waitress are friendly and the menu is fancy enough to be tasty but also cheap enough to fit with my student living ! I advice you to take a cappuccino and a cheese cake or a the salmon salad with an ice tea !"}
{"text":"Clientele surtout composé par des etudiants, cozy atmosphere, tres informel, menu satisfaisant pour un café snack, bonne chance pour trouver une table libre ;)"}
