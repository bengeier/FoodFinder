{"text":"Love going here! My last two visits were decent. The server honestly, was rude, I do not remember her name; but seriously, every other time I have been here EVERYONE is so nice. Also, the potatoes seem to be slightly undercooked, again this is a more recent thing happening here, I am guessing there is a newer cook. The biscuits and gravy, Cajun omelet and the coffee are to die for!! Definitely somewhere you should try at least once, anyone I have every taken here has become a huge fan and always comes back"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I can convince someone to get up early and eat some awesome biscuits and gravy, it is the best day ever! Seriously, I recommend the biscuits and gravy... plus the atmosphere is pretty neat. Kinda reminds me of a Grandma who hordes country decor lol.... they have great food though."}
{"text":"This hit the spot for breakfast for sure. Classic country breakfast food taste like it was made at home. Great price.  Will be coming back. I gave it 4 stars because of the chair I was in lol our waitress was an older lady so was kinda slow but she had great hospitality that made up for it."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find in Glendale AZ. Do yourself right by dining at this small but \"big diner. We had the biscuits and gravy, the food was homemade and the service was grand."}
{"text":"Not a good place for a someone looking to sit and have conversation, you feel claustrophobic and the seating is to close for comfort."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! My first time here, and I can honestly say we got both good food and good service!!!  We had the muffins, cinnamon rolls, seafood omelette, and pancakes. Food was outstanding and the people were extremely nice."}
{"text":"Still a good place to grab some brunch. Always a good special on the board to be had. Service is always good, even when the wait staff is curt. Forget 'Donnie's' up on Peoria and come here instead. True gem in Glendale."}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook is so old school! Its a charming little place that's good to take the family or friends to enjoy breakfast. I use to live near by here and was first taken by people that raved about this place. I was surprised that they were right on about how good the food was. I am not a morning/breakfast person, but for Kiss the Cook I will get my lazy butt up to enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the small town and family owned feel of this place! The staff was sweet, attentive and prompt ...even on Mother' day!"}
{"text":"Based on fellow Yelpers we checked out KTC this morning... Not too bad - Cute inside, we were in the back room which was a little dark... muffin basket that reviewers have noted was just small bran muffins... not awesome, but ok.  The staff (esp Donna) was attentive and the food came out quickly.  Definitely better than Denny's..."}
{"text":"We happened to be in the Glendale this AM, and found this place on Yelp. It did not disappoint! They had fresh Hawaiian Hazelnut coffee, and we ordered a cinnamon roll to come out before the meal. Simply put, a slice of heaven...

The breakfast was also great, eggs, ham ,and biscuits and gravy, YEAH. I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great breakfast in Glendale."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Good prices. Had the Cajun omelette not spicy and lots of flavor. Pancakes are delicious fluffy and buttery"}
{"text":"YAY! Good food and such friendly people. Sometimes my partner and I don't get such a great reception but this place loves the GAYS!! Can't beat the prices either...will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!!  I just wished I lived here so I could eat here everyday!  Best pancakes ever!!!  Sit in Nicole's section, she is great!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent breakfast. The biscults and gravy are amazing. Fresh coffee. The parking is a little small for full size trucks. Home style breakfast is a speciality here."}
{"text":"Delicious, home cooked breakfast. Susan our waitress was very pleasant and extremely efficient.  Visiting from California and will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food was good, but I am a stickler for good customer service. Unfortunately this place doesn't seem to have it, which is sad because it is very close to my work and we were looking for a good place to order our breakfast from in the mornings. The first time I went I was disappointed because I thought they delivered, but I chalked that up to a misunderstanding so no big deal. As I said they are very close to my job so picking up is not an issue. What was the issue is that when I arrived no one acknowledged me. There was someone there at the hostess desk that I was standing in front of, but she just stood there and kept doing what she was doing, no greeting or anything. Then she answered a call and took an order and then just walked away. I stood there for a little while until she came back and then acknowledged me. That rubbed me the wrong way, but again, I let it go because even though the restaurant wasn't busy at the time, doesn't mean they weren't busy with to go orders or something.  But today was the last straw, I called in to place another to go order so that my office could sample the lunch menu. The lady who answered the phone immediately asked if I could hold and I did for about 5 minutes and they hung up on me. This upset me, but I figured it was a mistake. So I called back and when the lady answered and asked what I would like to order. Before I placed my order I wanted to mention my issue with what had just happened. When I told her all I got was a kurt \"sorry\" and \"you wanted to place a to go order right so what do you want\". I decided not to place the order because I while I respect people in the service industry, I cannot respect or patron a restaurant whose staff has a complete disregard for its customers. Unacceptable."}
{"text":"I have driven by here so many times and have always seen how busy it is.  I decided to try it one day and I am glad I did. They serve these little mini muffins that come out hot and fresh. They were so delicious. I ordered the two egg breakfast which came with fried potatoes that tasted like my dad had made them and crispy bacon cooked to perfection. The eggs were cooked just perfect and nice and fluffy. 
It is small but very cozy and makes me imagine a small town eatery. The waitress was really great even though she was the waitress on the middle of the week day that I went. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I don't make pancakes anymore because of this place, the food is always exceptional.

The service is awesome and always comes with a personal touch and a smile, if you want breakfast go here anytime its open it will be great."}
{"text":"There was about a 15 min wait when we arrived however it seemed like there was always a 15 min wait to be seated for people. Usually a good sign of a great place to eat, and in the end was worth it.  Food was excellent. Service was great too. Great little place to dine at."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan.  The country cute decor is something I can get over but the food was overpriced, the service sucked and the place was super dirty.  We were sitting right next to the owners and if you can't get good service when sitting next to the big boss - it's a sign of trouble.  I would have given a 3 star but used the bathroom before leaving.  Well, I went into the bathroom anyways... didn't use it.  Totally disgusting and I have a feeling the kitchen isn't much better.  They should serve eggs-Benedict and french roast coffee to work with the country decor.  The place could be a gem but instead it's just a crapper"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. Best part of all: instead of bread they serve mini muffins!! Yes, it is annoying how small this place is and that you have to wait a while if it is busy to get a seat. Then once you are seated it feels quite crowded. The eggs are just ok. I much prefer the pancakes and sweeter side of the breakfast menu. It's not bad."}
{"text":"Just awesome! Cute atmosphere and great service. Ginger bronie rocked! Muffins were delicious. Will definitely go back again. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little place. I had the create your own omelet and it was huge and very delicious! The mini muffins they give you are full of flavor. Ours were zucchini and I couldn't stop eating them. The crispy potatoes they came with my meal were some of the best taters I've ever had. I loved how crispy they were. I got a side of the Cajun hollandaise sauce and omg it was incredible! I was dipping everything in it. It's sooooo good. Good food, friendly staff, cute place. I will come back for sure next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious, the hot cocoa was fantastic and they sell their adorable mugs. Definitely a win for breakfast :D"}
{"text":"Gone here couple times before and always like their garden eggs benedict. But this time I decided to change it up a bit and order their chorizo eggs benedict. It wasnt what I expected. Burnt, no pinto de gallo, pototoes was cold. Wasn't happy. My fiance got the corn beef hash, thumbs down. had to ask them to remake it. it was burnt yet soggy in the inside. overall not happy. used to be good. idk what happened. the cook probably had a rough morning. lol"}
{"text":"Only been here twice but must we've had nothing less than an awesome experience. Amazing food and great customer service...no complaints here, woild highly recommend to anyone. Also luv the decor, and their doggie treats are great too im guessing, our little 4 legged friend always enjoys them."}
{"text":"Came for a friends birthday and had a great time. Nicole was a fantastic server and even got the whole restaurant to sing happy birthday to the birthday girl. Food was great and will definetly be back."}
{"text":"A lovely, charming breakfast place!  The menu was unique, the prices were excellent, and service was friendly.  The basket of mini-muffins was a great touch.  Our food was served hot and fresh, and it was clear that everything is \"homemade\" - nothing seemed canned, frozen, or store-bought.  Even the fruit was 100% fresh!  My only critique, which I know doesn't matter to some, is that the coffee mugs are very small and I had to keep requesting a refill.  But I will definitely be back here!"}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook?  Shit - they should fire the cook!

I should have known before visiting that I wasn't going to like the place. After all, the AZ Repugnant rated this place as its #2 pick (behind Matt's Big Breakfast) as the top place to have breakfast in the Valley.  As the six friends who read my reviews know, I've never understood the hoopla around Matt's Big Breakfast - it's OK - but geesh -- #1?  What happened to The Farm at South Mountain -- now that's a unique-fantastic-organic-only-can-find-in-Phoenix-Phoenician experience.

Sigh - but I digress...

Ross and I enter \"Kiss the Cook\".  The interior is special - hard wood floors, mismatched seats and tables -- we both say it reminds us of a country store.  \"Nana\" is the one who shows us to our seats.  My hopes rise and I start thinking that AZ Republic scored on it's review.

We order.  Service is friendly, coffee was a little weak, but Ross loves the OJ.  Then the food arrives. 
 
The presentation is impressive.  My omelet was TALL!  FLUFFY!  Both Ross and I were wowed!  Then I cut into it and it was runny, soggy, and tepid (not really warm).  The waitress came by, asked how everything was (and she seemed to really mean it versus the polite ask but they don't really care to know the answer question that usually comes from waiters).  I told her about the omelet and she offered for them to recook it.  

She came back with my same omelet that must have been thrown in the microwave.  The top was steaming but interior now warmer - but not yet warm.   I picked around the soggy parts and ate the top (that was Ross' suggestion).

The waitress came back again, concerned that I wasn't eating enough.  She was so sweet.  I didn't want to make her feel badly.  But she sent the manager over -- which I thought was very proactive customer service.

The manager (maybe the owner?), stopped by and asked me what I thought might be wrong and offered up that it might be the egg beaters.  She did not offer me something else (but did suggest the next time I go in I should try the Pecan Cinnamon Roll).  And, when we got our bill, the omelet was still on it (they didn't comp my meal).

We paid and no complaint.  I don't expect to be comped, I just thought the experience with the manager was interesting."}
{"text":"Kiss the cook is by far one of the best breakfast places I've been to in a long time, the service is amazing, the food is to die for and the ambience of trinkets is just delightful. If you're in the Glendale area and want an amazing breakfast, kiss the cook is the place."}
{"text":"Went there for a nice Easter breakfast an the food was cold an the bacon was burnt would not tell my friends"}
{"text":"Beeeeeeest Breakfast ever!!!!!!! The place is cute and vintage looking! The male waiters are very good looking white boys! Makes u wana put then on a plate and enjoy!! Very satisfied with this place! The waffle is to diee for!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday brunch, my mom and I didn't have to wait long. They bring out a basket of mini muffins prior to your meal, and the meal itself was Delicious. The service wasn't so great we has to keep waiving  down our waitress to refill our drinks. Other  than that every else was great"}
{"text":"There will more than likely be a line for the indoor seating area because it is small, but there is a large patio that's open. The wait is for a reason because the food is really good. I recommend the Cajun Benedict because that Cajun sauce is especially good. Meal starts our with a variety of little muffins that are absolutely delicious as well. Great \"neighborhood feel\" to this place!"}
{"text":"Shaded dog friendly patio with a nice clean water bowl!  I would come again just for that, but the food and service was great too."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place . It had a lot of problems like they miss up my order 4 times in a row . After the 3 time I just told the lady to leave it and the worker told no , it's not my food , I was like whatever.  There was only 7 ppl there and I got everyone else food but mine . The oJ was good and there dog meal are cute . I'll won't be back"}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Can't believe I hadn't been here after living in the neighborhood so long. I enjoyed the laid back feeling of the homey decore and really appreciated the peace and quiet of this restaurant compared to a lot of the obnoxiously loud and chaotic breakfast spots out there. My wife and I had their flavored coffee, on this day it happened to be a Hawaiian hazelnut which I really enjoyed. The mini muffins and butter were a nice touch and were just enough to not take away from the breakfast entrees. My review would have been 4 stars, but while ordering I asked our server if the corn beef hash was made in house which she said it was turned out to be canned. Not terrible, the meal was still good, but had I been informed properlyI would have ordered differently. Service was great otherwise and I will definitely return to try the New Orleans omelet with Cajun hollandaise. The description looked really good so I'll look forward to that upon my return."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast options are slim around my boyfriend's house which is why I am so grateful for Kiss the Cook. We can all use a little kitsch with our breakfasts and Kiss the Cook has it in spades. Mismatched chairs and plates mixed in with country style antiques add some interest to your just awakening eyes. 

The food is tasty and homey. They start you off with a lovely basket of mini muffins (bran, strawberry and zucchini) which are piping hot and yummy. The zucchini is my favorite. They serve their coffee in clear glass mugs which I love because you get to watch the cream and coffee mix together. The food is really solid, I haven't had anything I didn't like yet. Their eggs benedict is quite good and their pancakes are really good.

The waitresses are friendly and quick with your order. The prices are fair. Now that its not an oven outside the patio is open so wait times have improved. In fact, over the weekend there wasn't a wait at all. This is a great, locally owned breakfast place to try out."}
{"text":"This place sucks the food sucks and so does the old ugly staff that serves it. I would rather starve. This place is called Kiss the Cook...but once you have eaten here you'll want to slap the cook!!!!! Save your money and avoid this place. It just isn't sanitary."}
{"text":"Quaint little place. I enjoyed the eggs benidict. The wee muffins are moist and delicious.  They also have a biscuit for fido. So sweet!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! The waitresses were super friendly and the food was amazing! Try their pecan cinnamon rolls...they are to die for! I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Kiss The Cook for first time two weeks ago. Even tho we had to wait it really was the 15 minutes we were told. The place was very crowded but server was friendly. Pretty good green chili omelette and Cajun eggs Benedict.  Went a second time last Sunday, this time the server was distracted, didn't bring the mini muffins until asked and coffee refills were non existent. We had the green chili omelette and special Burger Slider eggs Benedict which was English muffin -except not on mine, hamburger patties-the size of half dollars one undercooked  and one extremely overcooked, grilled onions-except not on mine, grilled tomato- one very thin slice for two eggs, eggs, sauce, and cheddar cheese-again except not on mine. The food came out 5 minutes apart with the Benedict first.  When we said something to the server about the missing parts of the Benedict her response was \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  That was it.  When we told the hostess/cashier about the poor food quality...same response \"Oh, I'm sorry\".  We tried to get someone from Kiss The Cook to acknowledge poor food, poor service and poor responsibility.  Never happened.  We eat breakfast out every weekend. We will not be returning to this place."}
{"text":"It is our tradition to have breakfest here every Christmas eve. Never disapointed, always satisfied, and filled with good food."}
{"text":"Like the massive three egg omelet but not happy with the ingredients used. Broccoli, jalapeño, etc. should be fresh, not the canned option. Service is ok, prices are fair. Will definitely pass on this place."}
{"text":"What a great little breakfast joint! Usually pretty busy and has quite the wait. We've gotten lucky a couple of times but definitely await on weekends. That said it's well worth the wait. The food is made to order and tastes like something you'd get at grandma's.  I've tried the French Toast,  waffles pancakes and chicken salad sandwich and they are all heavenly. Depending what you are in the mood for I'd vouch for any of those. I love the interior it's very quaint. Tables with chairs that don't match, tea sets in the cupboards along the back wall. My mom, daughter and I love to go for a girl's day brunch once a month."}
{"text":"A charming place with really yummy fresh food and the mix of mismatched plates and decor really give it a homey feeling. 
If it's busy (and it usually is) get ready to stand while you wait for your table! There are less than 30 tables at KtC so it can get uncomfortably cramped while you're waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"This place is adorably quaint and the food is awesome. The muffin baskets that they give you are a nice touch. But the service was not so great and the food was slow to come out."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. We used to go here all the time when I was a kid. I remember always getting their chocolate chip pancakes. Yum! We moved away from the area and hadnt been in a while. We drove by the other day and decided to drop in. Its just as good as I remember. Those little mini muffins that come with your breakfast are amazing and there omelets are really good. I saw that their special was pumpkin pancakes and Im going to have to come back and try those. They also have a new flavored coffee everyday. Really good. I love the decor, its just as I remember it 20 years ago. Its a cute little family owned place where they remember your name. Love it. Ill definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes and great eggs . We eat at a lot of breakfast places and we believe a pancake should stand alone without syrup ! Their pancakes didn't disappoint"}
{"text":"First time here and I will definitely be back! The food of course was amazing but what really made me want to leave a review was the service. Our waitress never let our coffee go half below and was very very sweet! And yes, those muffins!!!! Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place for breakfast!! Great food and the prices are not bad. Good service. The decor is sure to catch your eye!!!  Will come again."}
{"text":"The staff is nice, but slow. I have only eaten breakfast here. Nothing bad, nothing good. The food is bland and basic."}
{"text":"Today I'm having a omelette with ham mushrooms and avocado and mini muffins and like always good service"}
{"text":"I hit this place with the family one Sunday on the recommendation of an Internet article, naming it one of the top 9 breakfast spots in the area. It was ok, and probably rates somewhere in the middle of that list. The decor is sort of homey and random with a dash of countrification; we were seated on the patio at our request and received good, patient, attentive service. It won't break the bank to eat here, but everything is a la carte, so don't expect any sides to come with your meal. The beverages are overpriced for the amount given (almost $3 for a 12 ounce cup of fountain lemonade? half filled with ice? O_o) but the food was decent. It's a unique place but not special, if you get my drift. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but f you're in Glendale and have a hankering, give it a try."}
{"text":"We are in town on vacation and had been searching for a great underdog breakfast spot.  Kiss The Cook was exactly what we were looking for!  The whole atmosphere was lovely and the decor was kitschy, including the mismatched chairs.  We had the most wonderful waitress, the omelets were great and pancakes were divine.  Of course the complimentary piping hot zucchini muffins didn't hurt either.  The best restaurant find we've had on our trip."}
{"text":"It's such a cute little place with amazing food. Unique little concepts too. Give it a try"}
{"text":"Great good and excellent prices. We got our food to go but it was amazing. The huevos rancheros are so tasty."}
{"text":"If you are looking for pancakes, this is the place to be! These pancakes are so fluffy it's like eating clouds! The service isn't great,"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great prices! Excellent service! Super dog-friendly! No bones about it, I'll be returning for breakfast as often as I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced MUCH MUCH better.  Please keep in mind I have eaten here for several years now, but this past year has been a real disappointment.   The coffee is so weak any flavor you get is from the added cream.   The eggs benedict  was over cooked to the point where the yellow solid. So, I sent it back and was treated to runny whites the next time.   Clearly this is something they need to work on.        A few months ago we experienced the same exact problem which is why it took so long for me to give them another chance in the first place.  I, for one will not be going back nor can I, in good faith, recommend them.  Seriously, and I can't believe I am saying this, but Denny's is better.  Mimi's is REALLY my recommendation for a decent breakfast at decent prices. Last note, the staff was okay, but I ended up getting charged for the two coffees we had while waiting for food we never ate."}
{"text":"I've lived in glendale almost my entire life, this place is a gem. Love everything about it. The food is great (I always get breakfast), the servers are wonderful and the price is right. They even have homemade dog treats!"}
{"text":"After passing this place countless Xs, curiosity finally got the best of me so we finally stopped in 2 give them a try. There were a couple other occupied tables being tended 2. It was mid~day so it probably gets an influx of business in spurts during other Xs.

   W8ed a couple min8es 2 b seated by a friendly hostess who seemed 2 b busy helping the w8ress(es) serve up orders/refills. Woulda preferred seating ourselves if not 4 the w8 2 b seated sign, instead of feeling awkward by the stares of the elderly patrons there but got settled in2 a centrally loc8ed small table. No booths in case u wanted 2 know.

   I guess I understand the draw of this place 4 those that want the old fashioned home~style feel but dining there felt like being @ a cross between a Brass Armadillo & an Elderly Care facility. Though I did like looking @ some of the antiques 4 sale there, just felt a bit strange ~ almost like they're trying 2 pull off the ol' Bobby McGee's concept w/ vintage items like victorian boots, tubs etc but geared toward the much older.

   Even tho I wasn't personally impressed or as comfortable as I'd like, everything was ok/tolerable part of our experience till we Eventually got acknowledged by our w8ress who acted as tho we were graced by her presence, snapping what~dya~want @ us. I almost replied: 'a different server'... but bit my tongue 1dering if this was just part of the 'charm'.

   I ordered the Vegetarian sandwich & my companion went w/ the Seafood Omelette w/ iced tea & tomato juice 4 our beverage as she briskly walked away huffing/puffing/snorting like a bull ready 2 impale a matador. The hostess came over shortly w/ our drinks & a 1derful basket of cute li'l assorted mini muffins which turned out 2 b the best part of our meal/experience here, esp the AWESOME zucchini 1s!

   Tomato juice was just V~8 in a glass & the iced tea tasted soapy & bitter. Don't know if there was soap not rinsed out in the cup but if it was straight from the tea dispenser, it was far more than soapy 'residue' & the tea part I could even make out, tasted like liquified mold so EWWW we reluctantly drank water instead w8ing 2 notify the hostess as we didn't want others getting sick or 2 evoke more wrath from the server who was intent on giving every1 hell. 

   When our food was ready 2 b served, she stomped over & musta mistaken our pl8es 4 frisbees as they were nearly flung @ us, mine almost skid in2 my lap!! Didn't ask if we wanted/needed anything else & was done w/ us till slamming our damages slip down when she was obviously ready 4 us 2 pay/get rid of us. The prices here might have felt like a pretty good deal if more of what we ordered was decent. Perhaps it was a case of we spontaneously picked a bad day 2 go w/ an equally bad cook & w8ress or maybe they were a couple till that morning & the break~up was gonna make every1 else suffer!!

   I don't know if our server was having the worst day of her life or what, but apparently any1 else who had the mis4tune of her w8ing on them was getting the same treatment, so I guess we weren't being targeted. I even overheard a guy @ her other table telling her 'I thought I did something 2 make u mad @ me'. I couldn't make out what else was said, but it was obvious the poor hostess/cashier was trying 2 divert any neg8ivity by joking it off as something else.

   The Veg sandwich was good (not gr8 nor bad but slightly better than ok). His Seafood Omelette made him spit in2 his napkin st8ing it was overly salty (probably trying 2 cover up what he called 'unfresh ingredients & bad seafood'). Leaving most of his pl8, was never asked if everything was ok or if there was a prob cuz it was blatantly apparent that the snapping turtle who could only bark @ people really didn't give a F*ck except 2 make others b the outlet 4 her nastiness!! We always treat our servers nice & respectfully, making things easier 2 b cleared (which they never were) & whatever the case was w/ this 1, she either needed 2 leave the drama @ home or better yet stay home OR here's a concept: not work in any scenario that involves having 2 interact w/ customers/public in any facet...

   Kiss the Cook? More like, kiss their (_y_) A$S & still get sh*t!  IF we ever Dared 2 give them another shot (highly unlikely after what we were subjected 2), we'd b certain that some1/ANY1 else w8ed on us. Actually, scratch that ~ we'd have 2 make sure she wasn't there, cuz I'm sure I'm not the only 1 who doesn't wanna jump every other min8 w/ her slamming/snappy mouth/throwing things while trying 2 eat... nor feel like WEARING what was ordered (which depending on what it is) might b better than actually eating it ~ YIKES!!"}
{"text":"Let's see. It took 10 minutes before someone took our drink order. Then, for some reason, you are forced to wait for a basket of cheap dry muffins, before they will take your order. From the time we sat down, until the time we were served, it took exactly one hour. This is breakfast we are talking about. My over medium eggs, arrived over-hard. And the waiter forgot my toast. I sent the eggs back, and they punished me with some extremely Ronnie called very over easy eggs. I guess they just didn't want to make them over medium. I guess I'm a prick for thinking I can order food there way I like it in a restaurant. I will never go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Ok food. Pricing kind of high. Nothing special. Staff did not go out of their way to make you feel welcome. If Ian in the are I would go back. Not worth the drive from north side."}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab a nice quiet breakfast. Tried it for the first time last weekend. The price is fair, spent about $25 after tip for two of us. The food was delicious. The service was good. Had a ten minute wait to be seated at 11AM on a Sunday.

Our waiter kept our drinks refilled. Unfortunately their cups are so small that I required 4 refills, but I never felt neglected. Honestly the small cup thing scared me, that had real potential to screw up my meal if they weren't paying attention...but they were so it's all good.

I had a real generic breakfast of eggs, bacon, pancakes, and a side of toast. It was all very good. I paid the extra $1 for \"thick\" bacon, and that was totally worth it. My girl got cornbeef hash and eggs, and she thought it was very good.

Next time I probably will try the \"New Orleans Omelet\". Sounded good, but at a new place I usually go generic to test the water, and get fancy my 2nd go around.

 Impressive breakfast, I probably would've kissed that cook."}
{"text":"Loved it. Friendly, efficient staff. Warm, welcoming decor. Delicious food - nothing fancy and perfect portions. Very affordable. Exactly what we were looking for. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"My fist time here I really liked it I had the cook plate The buttermilk pancakes where  so good .  it's way better than Denny's & IHOP and all those big chain companies . Oh and is way cheaper too !"}
{"text":"Always great breakfast!  The chocolate chip pancakes are amazing and the muffins are spectacular!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast! We had the garden bene and the country breakfast. Both were excellent! The staff was very friendly and helpful. We only had to wait a few minutes even though it was busy. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is awesome. I had a combo eggs and pancake and their pecan roll. It's all awesome. Super fresh tasting and just really, really good. Pancake is light, pecan roll is pretty divine. People who work there are pretty friendly too. Would definitely come back and bring a morning date too."}
{"text":"man what to say about this place the little muffins are good hot bought some to take home but so good when there not hot order omelette and waffle start of with waffle it was a little bland just OK  now the omelet there was just something not good not sure but they could of been eggs from a carton the potato's that come with the eggs tasted boiled or freezer burn the server is what made it 3 stars she saved the day will come back and try lunch"}
{"text":"We use to come here for breakfast, they use have friendly staff but it's not the same anymore, not impressed what so ever.  But their food is still good."}
{"text":"Perfect way to spend a Sunday morning! Great pancakes and eggs.
This place is small and cozy.  
We took two small dogs and ordered from the Doggie menu which has several good 
options to choose from.
This place is family owned and operates with pride!  They make sure you feel welcome and get what you came for!
Highly recommended if you want good food inside or out and if you want to take Fido..."}
{"text":"Little bit of a wait. Food is good nothing fancy. fresh and delicious. muffin basket is excellent."}
{"text":"My sister was visiting and I wanted to take her somewhere special for breakfast. Kiss the Cook from what I read online sounded like a great place. When we got there it took a little while for service to begin. I actually had to ask someone for some attention. We were a large table of ten. Boy, once our waitress came she made up for the wait. The food was great and so was the service. It was a special meal, a unique place and the food was wonderful. Everyone at our table kids included were satisfied and happy. I highly recommend Kiss the Cook for a special breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I have visited \"Kiss the Cook\" several times and I always get a bakers basket warm mini muffins with butter. My favorite are the mini brand muffins. My boyfriend loves the Cajun eggs Benedict. He refuses to try anything else. Staff is wonderful!! I always see the same servers working every time I visit. Makes it feel like one big family is eating breakfast at grandmas house. Absolutely love \"Kiss the Cook\""}
{"text":"This place is just so good! We used to go to the Good Egg but since we had a bad encounter with a very rude server we haven't brought ourselves to go back. 

We get stuck in routines when it comes to restaurant so finding a new breakfast joint seemed like it would take forever. I binged and found Kiss the Cook. It is kind of a drive for us but I have been wanting to try something new. 

The outside doesn't appear to be anything special but I was wrong. The inside of the place is just gorgeous. I love all the many different tables and chairs and even those fluffy little cat miniature figurines. The servers are pleasant and quick and I have no complaints so far. 

The food is delicious! Great big helpings and it isn't greasy! My daughter and I almost always devour the scrumptious muffins but we try to refrain ourselves in order to save room for our food which is delicious. 

Definitely worth a try. Great service, atmosphere, and above all a great breakfast!"}
{"text":"Our friends took us here for breakfast and wow they picked a winner. The food, no matter what you get is all out of this world!

They will let you know they fear the lightrail expansion though."}
{"text":"A small cozy restaurant the food was really good it was a busy day but I felt our waitress could've been more friendlier. I think overall we really liked this place and the basket of muffins are so yummy that's a seller. Only reason I give it four is because trying to pay was the hassle. The cash register is so close to the door and people waiting the people cut in front of you and you're just taking forever to check out"}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook is a cute little breakfast nook in Glendale. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash, which came with has, two eggs, and potatoes. Also, they give you a basket of mini muffins for the table if you order certain items from the menu. The mini muffins are a nice touch and the bran flavor is best in my opinion. The corned beef hash was tasty, however it was a bit oily and greasy for my taste. Potatoes were really good as well. My one complaint was the portion sizes were a little small. Usually I have a hard time finishing everything on the plate, but here I ate everything and was still left feeling a little hungry. Overall, Kiss the Cook is worth the trip if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Gosh, this restaurant is so cute and absolutely delicious. They bring you out free muffins while you wait for your breakfast. You can tell that it is family-owned and that they take pride in this restaurant. The prices are really great and the service always is too."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We sat on the patio with our dog and he received just as amazing of service as we did!! They even had s menu for him. 

I got the eggs Benedict and it was great! My husband got the stuffed french toast and I was almost sad that I didn't get that after stealing a bite of his."}
{"text":"The owner was our waitress and super nice!  We sat outside on a perfect October morning.  Great selection, great prices.  It has a more \"homey\" feel than other places and I love that they leave a pitcher of water on the table.  I had the pecan cinnamon roll which was delicious!  My friend had the 3 cheese grilled cheese and pasta salad which was also yummy.  My other friend had an omelet which came with a basket of mini muffins.  The zucchini one was the best!  They even welcome dogs in their outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"Everything was made on the premises & you can really tell the difference! Excellent mini muffins (zucchini & pumpkin are my favs!) & really enjoyed the Garden Eggs Benedict (with mushrooms & spinach)! Country potatoes were very good too!"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonably priced, good service. These are important factors when I consider if I will return to a place of business. 
Hour wait time was not too long on a Saturday morning. There was coffee and water outside for those waiting to be seated. When we got inside it was a little crowded but the food was good. I ordered the Cook's breakfast (might be called something else... this was a couple days ago).  It came with pancakes, eggs, sausage, and the mini muffins. The mini muffins are my favorite part-like most people's, specifically the zucchini ones.  I will come back!"}
{"text":"Large menu, good breakfast, decent coffee. Muffin basket is usually really good but sometimes you get all of the same flavor instead of an assortment. Avoid the cinnamon rolls...too dry and harden while you are eating them."}
{"text":"We really like this restaurant, but do not go there more often, because their coffee is just not good. We tried it again this morning, and love the restaurant, the food, and the service, but the coffee is still not good,it is weak, not very flavorful, and this morning tasted a little burnt."}
{"text":"I'll never go back there. Pricey, overrated and we just felt out of place. The \"eclectic\" atmosphere didn't make up for the unwelcome feeling we had. Never again. There are way too many places that deserve our hard earned money. The food was forgettable!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast! From the hostess to the wait staff they make you feel right at home! The food is fantastic and if you want to substitute something it's fine with them. Mom and I keep going back. Try it you'll find a new eatery..."}
{"text":"went to KTC for beakfast and the menu was amazin, love the muffins and the omelets are great. the price was very good and the coffee is very good. nice old house down south feeling. I will go back again to try the lunch salads,  they look amazing."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast/brunch place! Their Cajun style Benedict is amazing, the sauce is good and spicy! They offer a daily flavored coffee and give you a basket of mini muffins to munch on while you wait for your meal!"}
{"text":"The country gravy is excellent and the mini muffins are dangerously good.  There was a bit of a wait but less than 15 minutes.  Has an interesting atmosphere with all the antiques."}
{"text":"We waited about 15 minutes. As soon as we were seated our waiter greeted us and asked for our drink order, he returned in a few minutes. Then returned a few minutes later to get our order. We placed it. I ordered Huevos Rancheros and the wife ordered a Cajun Omelette. Both were wonderful and had lots of flavor. Your meals  come with a Baker's Basket, three different types of mini muffins fresh and warm, all three were great. These are brought to you before your meal while you are waiting. Our food came within minutes of finishing the basket. Quick, great service and food. We will return again. Great first experience."}
{"text":"This is definitely my new favorite breakfast spot. The service is absolutely wonderful and the decor is the most quaint thing I have seen! They start you off with fresh mini muffins - bran and zucchini walnut and they just melt in your mouth with the butter spread on the warm muffin.

Had the special of the day - omelet with swiss cheese, ham, spinach and garlic and oh my goodness was it delicious.

We ordered a cinnamon bun to share and it was so yummy, covered in caramel (but not too sweet).

Definitely must go!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was cute, quaint, and had fantastic service.  I had the French toast, but I'm still obsessing over the freshly squeezed orange juice (which was delicious).  I definitely would recommend this place for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Back in the day I would have gave Kiss the Cook a solid 3.  Not any more.  The last few times we've been there have been worse and worse.  The last visit was the final straw.  The bakers basket ( a few muffins) were undercooked.  YUCK!  The eggs were cold and dry.  The potatos were still hard.  Even the service was no good.  I dont know what happened to this place.  It used to be a cool dive for breakfast.  Not any more.  The two comments about slapping the cook and firing the cook are spot on.  The real punch in the gut was that there was a poster on the door that was begging patrons to go online and request that they be casted on DDD.  I emailed the link but instead of asking them to use Kiss the cook on an episode, I urged them to avoid eating there at all costs.  Get it together."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by my first visit to \"Kiss the Cook\". My family and I visited for the first time on a Sunday. The restaurant is instantly welcoming and cozy. The place smelled like coffee and muffins. The menu had a lot of tasty dishes I would love to try next time I visit, like crepes and pancakes but I went with an omelette and home fries. I enjoyed my food. The food, the service, the atmosphere all felt like the staff  cares about the experience the patrons have.  Did I mention the muffins? They offer a complimentary basket of mini muffins for the table with certain dishes (I think that's how it works, I'm not sure).  The muffins were warm, moist and delicious. The coffee is served in glass cups.  I prefer mugs but I appreciate that they have a signature thing.  I wish the coffee was better but it certainly wasn't bad. I also liked that they offer flavored coffee.  The place was full when we visited.  It's a really nice, laid back restaurant and I look forward to coming back. I would have come sooner but when I would see their signage from the car as we drove by I was worried because it seemed a bit outdated.  I didn't know what that would mean if we went inside.  Upon visiting, my experienced proved to be very positive.  I like this place."}
{"text":"I had the corned beef hash and eggs.  Lose 1 star for unseasoned potatoes.  Gain it back for scratch corned beef.  Lose two stars for weird ambiance.  I get the look they are going for, but the chairs were down right uncomfortable.  Gain 1 star back for great coffee, and frequent refills.  I think that gets me to four.  Very well priced-good value for the money.  Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"The wait can be long. The food is good and mini muffins are fabulous!
The restaurant itself needs a good cleaning.
Service is ok.
A place to try at least once."}
{"text":"This is the most charming place to eat for breakfast. Delicious food. Awesome service.  We had pancakes. We had eggs. We had omelettes. We had the pecan roll. You name it. Fresh squeezed oj. Bacon. Sausage. Everything was fantastic. You will not be disappointed. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"It's just ok in my book. My omlet was good, as were the potatoes. My husband ordered the corn beef hash and upon ordering he asked if they make it from scratch, waitress said, \"yes, it was.\" We think it's canned and then doctored up. My kids had a ham sandwich, also just ok. I think the best part about breakfast was the fresh squeezed juice."}
{"text":"What a cute little spot! Very homey. And the staff were friendly. Cute little country style place. Couldn't resist the mini muffins while we waited. Delicious! We will be coming back again and again. It was busy but the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place. It was so pleasant with the old knickknacks and great service. You could tell their were a some regulars when we went. The food was good, and I'm not a breakfast person. Happy 33rd birthday!"}
{"text":"If you're ever in Glendale and you need to come to a breakfast spot this is the place it has a very charming feel. The menu is small but most of the things are good."}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect when I found this little place.  But what I found in a restaurant where the food is good, the help is friendly, and it definitely has a personality!  

First, the food is good,  I have eaten there twice with a friend and both times our food was cooked to our specifications, was tasty, and was served quickly.  
This is no austere setting.  The tables and chairs are all different, there are shelves holding all manner of things ranging from older kitchen ware, cutsie signs and at the register, they sell home made dog treats.

The food is well portioned, and the coffee was pretty darn good.  
  
The only reason this is not a 5 is that the entry way is cramped and confusing.  They are doing the check out and greeting area in the same small place.  It does not work well for me."}
{"text":"Wait staff seemed like they were having a hard day, snapping at each other and not overly friendly to the customers. The basket of mini muffins was the best part of our meal. Just regular breakfast fare, nothing special. Restaurant could have been cleaner, not in a great part of town. Homeless /transient population hanging out in the parking lot, made it feel somewhat unsafe."}
{"text":"We enjoyed breakfast there yesterday morning. Our server Steven was fantastic. The food was incredible. My son got the cinnamon roll, I got the strawberry stuffed French toast, and my daughter had the banana pancakes. They cooked the bananas in the pancakes which was unexpected but was very tasty. The cinnamon roll was phenomenal, the stuffed French toast was great but was stuffed with cream cream and the strawberries were on the outside still good though. 

The service was great, food was great, and it was a beautiful morning so we sat on the patio and it was overall a great experience. 

The only downfall was the kitchen was backed up so it was quite a long wait for the food but at least the server kept us informed about he hold ups. Communication is key and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hi,

I will admit the name was what enticed me to visit Kiss the cook. I am sure I am not the only one who has done this. Anyhow, upon walking in I really liked the cozy ambience. The waitresses all have that mom-like-feel. What is that you ask? They were all aged enough to be my mom. Super adorable and sweet. I felt so catered to and loved on by complete strange older woman. 

As for the food; Menu is very simple and pretty much comfort food or anything that will fill you up and make you feel like a stuffed sausage. Upon being seated you are greeted with a smile and a basket filled with their house muffins. I ate one or five. I cant remember, but they were warm, moist and delicious. Overall, portions are very generous. Food had great flavor. 

It's pretty easy. If you want a good breakfast or lunch and you are in the area this is definitely a place to visit. They have an outdoor pet friendly area, spacious indoor seating and a wonderful vibe. 
Oh, and when you are provided with the check, you are given \"kisses\" Hershey Kisses. 

Great for a meet up with friends, family or solo date. 

XOXO

{"text":"Kiss the cook is an awesome restaurant. It is locally owned and the food is really amazing. Its quaint with antiques and homemade desserts. I ordered the biscuit and gravy meal. It came with a bakers basket, a small basket with 6mini homemade muffins. They were piping hot and delicious. My meal came with potatoes, eggs and biscuits and gravy. I added 2slices bacon for only 1.75. My husband had the Cajun omelette it had a spicy hollandaise sauce. He devoured the whole thing. 

Everything tastes like it is made from scratch and very fresh. If you are in Glendale you need to check it out. They are open until 2:30 so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Love their home like feel to their restaurant. Something bout their muffins and coffee make my mouth water. I'm up and out early every morning so their early opening time is wonderful for me. The only thing that is disappointing is the lack of space between seats and tables. It's very crammed. I've still come back though."}
{"text":"Cozy and comfortable with eclectic mismatched tables and chairs and lots of interesting decor on the walls.  Went for a late breakfast when we flew in from the Midwest to see my 92y/o mother who was visiting my brother.  Definitely a better choice than visiting her in Buffalo, NY this time of year.  Independent diner with great omelette choices, especially the Jalapeño & cheese, as well as traditional breakfast choices (Eggs Benedict).  OMG!!!  Added to the muffin basket, you've amped the comfort food level to the stratosphere (in addition to excellent handicapped accessibility)."}
{"text":"The best eggs benedict I've had in a longtime. Sooo good! Definitely recommend them. Also the mini muffins were delicious. Staff was very nice and accommodating as well."}
{"text":"I would rate a 2.5. Our very first experience was amazing a week ago, food was great the cinnamon pecan roll was to die for smothered in the pecan Carmel sauce. service was excellent. Thought this would be our go to place from now on for breakfast with my Wife. But our next experience was not so amazing. Service was really slow, the food was not the same and the cinnamon was not made like it was the first time not so much of the pecan sauce on the roll very disappointed. took a long time to get the attention of our waitress, it appeared that they seemed to cater more towards the regulars that they knew by name. Not sure if we would be returning in hopes it was just a bad day."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh especially the fruit. Was surprised the menu said seasonal fruit and they actually brought out seasonal fruit and it was fresh. Watermelon.... Yum everything else was standard. I had an omelet with tomato, broccoli and light cheese. Delicious! And a Belgium Waffle which was nice and fluffy. I could only eat half of everything but it was delicious. 
 I didn't have any protein but I had my Shakeology this morning No Worries.   

Www.shakeology.com/msjeter

Will be back!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying food is very good yet a little overpriced in my personal opinion. Still 5 star worthy for food quality. I took one star for the service. The server was a little rude and cold(maybe she had a bad night sleep, who knows) and seemed bother by first timers asking about menu items. 

Had the biscuits and gravy. All very fresh and tasty. Coffee kept coming in not by our server by someone else, strange but il keep it. 

Overall i might try this place in the future."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Phoenix!!! Hands down. Had an egg white Cajun omelette. Unbelievable!!!!! And the pancakes where off the hook. A great place to be at. 
They prefer cash. Keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Very home feel place. Good was amazing. And the muffins were to die for. They had mis match chairs to sit in which made me fall in love with it. It is a small place so it gets busy and packed quick."}
{"text":"First time here. First impression. Antique mom and pop shop style of decor and atmosphere. Figured the food was going to be okay at best, but it was way better. The potatoes were nice and crispy, the eggs were perfectly cooked, the cornbeef hash had a nice crispy top layer to it. The price was fairly inexpensive and the food was perfect temperature. Overall a great first experience. I will be returning"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and its pretty good. They have a cute, southern, sitting on the back porch, kind of vibe. I had the veggie benedict w/ the hollandaise on the side. And I really have no complaints. I tried to \"tweek\"
 my order (i.e. avocado instead of mushrooms) and it didn't come out as requested, but it was a busy Sunday morning so I pushed my mushrooms to the side of the plate and kept it moving. The world didn't end and my food was still edible. My friend had the veggie omelet and corn beef hash. I tried his corn beef hash and it was pretty good. It was my first time ever having it so I have nothing to compare it to, but it worked for me. All in all, Kiss the Cook is a cute little breakfast/brunch spot with pretty good food and I will definitely give it another try."}
{"text":"Delicious country sausage gravy! Probably the best I've had! Tastes just like Grandmas homemade! Great service and a very friendly family feel for breakfast! Kids enjoyed every bite! Will definitely return for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This had been on my saved list for quite some time. The staff was very friendly and I love the random decor. Mismatched chairs (intentional) and fun interior. Coffee was hot and fresh. Mini muffin basket was a great because while I like to have a savory breakfast most of the time I always want a little something sweet in there, but I don't want a whole side of pancakes or French toast. So this was nice. They weren't amazing muffins, but they were all I needed. Breakfast came out fast. I like more unique options on the menu. My husband got the new Orleans omelet and that was delicious. I had the omelet that was in special. They were both Uber fluffy, cheesy and delicious. The home fries were also seasoned well and very tasty.. No bland potatoes here. Overall I would say a 3.5 but that's not an option in here. If I was in the area I would go back in a heartbeat, but I wouldn't make a trek across the city for it."}
{"text":"We stopped here for an early breakfast and the food was really good. The atmosphere is laid back and the staff is nice. We loved the muffins with our meal too!"}
{"text":"Very great breakfast place. We were very pleased with Susan (our waitress). She gave us the best service and it was also very busy this Sunday morning. Coffee is delicious. Yes you can have a whole waffle for just $1 more and it's worth it."}
{"text":"lEveryone raves about kiss the cook.  It's ok but there are some other places just as good.  Menu is fairly limited.  Muffins come with each order.  Waitresses are fun and sassy.
Place is usually crowded when we go in.  Like I said, everyone goes crazy over it but me and for me it's ok."}
{"text":"I Love omelett And this place Is one OF the best omelletes, todays special Is Good. this place is amazing from the customer service  and food"}
{"text":"This place is adorable, it reminds of a sweet little Granny's home! Our server was as kind as could be & started us off with some delicious muffins that we devoured. I ordered their biscuits & gravy which was pretty good! I would try them again. My toddler loved looking around at everything in the restaurant. Would come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a while and for good reasons. They have affordable and delicious food. I've only ever had their breakfast and everytime it has been delicious. I recently went two weekends in a row and both times did not dissapoint. The first time I got their Cajun Style Eggs Benedict. I ordered mine over medium. The eggs came out perfect and the sauce they use in lieu of hollandaise was to die for. I mean I just want to smother all my food with it. It was the right amount of spicy and the right amount of flavor. The breakfast comes with their world famous mini muffins. The second time I got their traditional breakfast with pancakes. The PANCAKES are amazing. Fluffy to perfection and just topped off with enough butter. I also ordered a waffle and let me tell you. I loved the Waffle. It wasn't overtly sweet and it was crispy on the outside. They have applewood smoked bacon that is pretty delicious. The only negative thing that I can say about this place is that their coffee sucks. Sometimes you get those clear glass coffee cups and you can see straigh through it with coffee in it. I love strong strong coffee and even Denny's serves stronger coffee than this. The service at this mom and pop place is amazing. Every single employee makes you feel at home. They treat you like family and are great at making food recomendations. Overall, this place is good, cheap and delicious. Don't let the long line scare you away because it sure does get busy."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very nice servers. The food is reasonably priced and they aren't stingy with their portions. Cute place and you get mini muffins"}
{"text":"It's Mother's Day and I knew restaurants would be crowded.  Imagine my surprise when this restaurant says they take reservations!  They say it was a 45 minute wait at that time, so I put my name down for 45 minutes.  We hurried to get there on time and they said it would be 20 minutes for a table... pardon me?  You said it was a reservation and now there's a 20 minute wait ON TOP of the reservation time?  After waiting 35 minutes with 2 very hungry children (I asked for some muffins for them and was given one for each of the kids, and then a waitress saw them cranky still and gave them another one, which was nice) we were finally seated.  The hostess asked if the table was fine and I had to bite the insides of my cheeks to keep from saying, \"It'll have to do because I'm not waiting longer for another table!\"  We saw people that got there after us in 4 party tables get seated before us because they were complaining.  WTF?  If they can't wait their turn, there's a Sonic down the street with no wait.

Anyway, we were seated and ordered quickly.  My 6 year old got the Cooks Combo, my 3 year old got the yogurt parfait (we changed the fruit to strawberries and bananas because they used honeydew, cantaloupe and pineapple in theirs, which sounded gross and a concoction that would result in curdled yogurt if the pineapple was fresh!)  I got the crab cake eggs Benedict (it was on special), and my husband got eggs with turkey sausage and potatoes.  We were given a basket of cold muffins, which were tasty but not piping hot like Missy's review.  The food came out quickly, which was surprising because they were quite busy.  Our waitress was a very nice lady and welcomed the change in the yogurt parfait (I really hate when waitresses get snippy if you change something very slight!)  Everyone was happy with their food.  I was mildly annoyed that the eggs weren't poached properly, they were overdone, resulting in no glorious egg yolk mixing with the Hollandaise, but other than that I would order that dish again.

We probably won't be back again though because it's a bit of a drive, a long wait, and I felt like I was stuck in a Seinfeld episode (a mesh of the car reservation episode and the Chinese restaurant episode).  The service was friendly, the food was good, but if you can't keep reservations, don't take them and sure as heck don't offer them!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It's your typical diner food, pancakes, Omelets, steak and eggs, but they're actually very satisfying. The inside is a little small so thankfully it was a cool morning for the patio. The people are very friendly and helpful. Great place and good food! We'll be coming back again :)"}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but it wasn't anything special either. The five of us each got a different dish so we can have variety. The best was the eggs Benedict. Pumpkin pancakes had too much cinnamon. I got the corned beef hash which was over salted. Definitely prefer the corned beef hash at The Place. They had fresh squeezed orange juice on the menu but when we asked, we were told it was out of the box. I ordered a side of thick cut bacon which turned out to look like regular bacon. We were reassured that it was wider then the other bacon. I don't like this false advertising of menu items. The only saving grace was the mini muffins but I'm not sure if its worth a trip back. Maybe if I happen to be around the area."}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy. Perfect for Breakfast on a Sunday morning. Prices are affordable and the quality of the food was great. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, they do serve mini muffins.They are good but you are now charged for them. After new 2018 wage increase passed.I seem to always leave hungry from here.Waitresses are mom like women.50/50 sometimes the service is good y sometimes it is not. Same w the food, portions are small y prices are not. Saw waitress clear table of dirty glasses y not wash hands. Stick fingers inside new glasses to put on table. That is not safe as it spreads germs from previous customers. I'm very picky about cleanliness w dishes y spreading germs. Maybe happens at other places too, but since I seen this myself, have not been back. Flu season is strong here in Az. Y I'm going to be safe to avoid it. Will not be in a hurry to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Had an excellent scramble.  Potatoes were fantastic.  Bought a mug.  Best breakfast I have had in years."}
{"text":"What a beautiful and eclectic place to eat. The decor is so lovely and country, they have all of the little pieces I'd love to have. I love this cafe! However I do have a bit of complaint about the cleanliness of the restrooms. As for the food it's basic. Simple omelets and simple breakfast foods. Some items are more tasty than others and some items I simply cannot try. The coffee was great (however no non-dairy options for creamers) Come check it out for yourself and you be the judge. I'll still come back again."}
{"text":"It's is a cute place and gets a good crowd. I think the food is okay. It is not served as the average place and definitely has a home cooked feel which makes it better, but I think it's average. Maybe lunch is better than breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. Come early because it gets full.  I've been coming here for years whenever I am on that side of town. It has never let me down. Good old fashioned home cooking."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple times and both have been good experiences. Family place and very busy! Went with friends and we all enjoyed our food and left full. The price is reasonable and the food is brought out quickly. The servers were nice older ladies. Delicious gray and biscuits! Would suggest trying them yourself!"}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on Yelp and it was quite an experience. This is a very small place but they also have an outside patio. The place is very unique and full of antique decorations (which some are for sale). I went on a Monday late morning and the place was full! we had to wait a little to be seated. The food was good, the bacon was nice and crispy. The pancakes were soft and fluffy but a bit small compared to other breakfast places I've been too.(nothing bad) Deepening on what you choose, they give you small muffins, the muffins were delicious! However, I did find their coffee to be very light , it lack a robust taste. Over all this is a great place to have a good breakfast! The menu prices are very reasonable, and once again their decor is super cute."}
{"text":"This is possibly the most adorable looking restaurant in Glendale. You walk in to what looks like an antique shop with a grandma's dining room kind of look. They offer a large dog friendly patio and the Facebook page says to ask for the dog menu so I really wanted to love this place. 

They started us off with fresh hot just baked mini muffins of two varieties one tasted like vanilla cake with chocolate chips the other was some sort of spiced muffin. They reminded me of box mixes.

My cajun chicken caesar salad arrives. The greens look fresh and crisp and the garlic parmesan breadstick looks like cheesy toast. I tasted the chicken and it taste very salty and over marinated like processed chicken from Costco. It might be the teriyaki flavor topped with too much salt. The taste of it made my stomach upset. The one thing I tried that was delicious was the crispy cheesy toast they gave me. They should feature that toast on the menu because it was unique and tasty. It was kind of like a crispy grilled cheese. I had to share it with my husband because there were some issues with his meal.

My husband had the breakfast special. It was missing the green onions and tomatoes that our waiter said would it would have. The eggs were fine but the pulled pork under the eggs lacked favors and the muffins underneath needed some toasting because they were very soggy. Lastly they forgot to fry the potatoes. It seemed like someone took a baked potato cut it up and just threw it in the oven. This made the potatoes very dry like chalk.


Sadly I have to kiss this place good bye!"}
{"text":"went for first time week ago.. wont be our last.. wait staff very nice and food very good... enjoyed the experience"}
{"text":"Super cute breakfast spot in Glendale! Delicious food! Also dog friendly on the patio and they have their own menu.  Staff is friendly and the setup is like being at nanas cozy home! Definitely recommend coming here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"We finally had a opportunity to try this place after all the rave about it. We have heard nothing but good things about this place. So we came in expecting the best. There is no doubt about it! Place is popular, a lot of people were there! The decor is very over powering, stuff everywhere! Looks like a bunch of junk to me? Any way I'm not there to look! I am there to eat!! All three of us had breakfast, the usual! Biscuit and gravy, eggs, hash browns, bacon, skillet, and I had the waffle. Food was good, there is no doubt about it! You will not be disappointed in the food. But is was not the best!! I have had much better. So we walked away satisfied, and would come back. But don't tell me this is the best place around."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy for the tummy!  Check out this place and for there awesome food!  We had Oscar roll, homemade chili, crepes and a KTC hamburger with home potatoes.  All good and friend, welcoming staff."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast. Service good, coffee stayed flowing. Everything I ordered was very tasty. Try the cinnamon roll. It's A +"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Everything I have gotten there is wonderful. Their omelettes are huge. I've had the Cajun, and pulled pork which is awesome. I've also had the Cajun style eggs Benedict. Everything I've ordered has come with a basket of mini muffins. Make sure to try their cinnamon pecan roll, my wife and I usually share one. The service is sometimes a little slow, but with good food, who really cares. Next time your debating between one of those chain restaurants and this place for breakfast, go here."}
{"text":"Not impressed - food was flavorless. The set-up was cramped but cute vintage and unique. Wait staff looked run down but were nice. My corn beef hash was mushy with uncooked veggies.  The basket of muffins was okay but dry. My wife's biscuit and gravy was bland and cold, potatoes had no seasoning. We wasted $30 and the only pleasant was the wheat toast and my son's pancakes. Even the bacon was soggy and it is hard to hate bacon. We will not return."}
{"text":"Our first time here. After watching check please Arizona on PBS I thought I would give it a try. Had the New Orleans Cajun Omelette accompanied with grandmas fried potatoes. It was outstanding! 
A cute, antique-cluttered restaurant offering the west side commendable breakfasts and lunches. 
Sandwiches, which are served in bags can be accompanied by homemade soups, salads and desserts. Earlier in the day, we love the French toast.
And most entrees come with a cute little basket holding a variety of tasty mini-muffins. It's that kind of extra touch that truly makes you feel good. 
Definitely will come back looking to try the Eggs Benedict cajun style."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best omelet I've ever had...made with fresh eggs (from the shell), fresh squeezed Orange juice and delicious basket of miniature muffins (3-4 types.)  My brother had pancakes -and they claimed they had these best pancakes in the nation - and he agreed (he just wished he had ordered more!)"}
{"text":"Waitress was extremely friendly, service was excellent. We were seated immediately, the dining area is small but not crowded, very cozy. Drink order was taken as soon as we were seated. Special of the day was shared when we were served our drinks. Muffin basket came out very hot with a nice variety of mini muffins and butter. Seasonal mini plates were provided for our muffins. Mine was a really cute Santa. My sister had a snowman. Order was taken and served in a very timely manner. Waitress kept our drinks hot and full. Serving portions were perfect, not too much/not too little. Our comfort and needs were a priority."}
{"text":"We love this place!! Great homemade food and awesome service!!. Oh, and the biscuits are a treat!"}
{"text":"Just started working in this area, and first day the boss says, that he is going to be in late so you can wait a few hours to come, since I wanted to be early and was already in the area, and skipped breakfast to get there on time, I was starved and this place looked like a good breakfast spot. I was wrong.

It was a GREAT breakfast spot. Service was fast, polite, and the food was great. I got the make your own omelet with the potatoes and some coffee and tea. The coffee mugs are unique compared to any place I have ever been to, they are a clear glass mug. It was a bit different. Overall very very good. I just kind of relaxed and enjoyed my meal, no rush it was very good, and the portions were pretty hefty, you can never tell what your going to get at these smaller places. So I was pleasantly surprised. And my check was less then $15.00 so not to shabby for the portion sizes. And i almost forgot they give you this basket of these delicious little tiny muffins, these things are like biting into heaven. They were so good. Pretty sure they are complimentary. 

This place has a real small town feel to it, you could tell allot of the people inside were regulars. Everybody seemed really friendly. 

The only reason this place didn't get five stars, because the parking lot didn't really have a good parking set up to get in, I had to walk around the building across the porch which was kind of dirty and could use a coat of paint or protection, and I didn't see any handicap spots...if they were there the signs were not very visible. That and it could use a good thorough cleaning on the inside, lots of nick knacks and stuff up, they are all pretty dusty. Could use a good cleaning. 

Over all thou, a real good experience I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was average.  Service was friendly but bad. Multiple small mistakes.  They changed the special after I ordered (steak to chicken) but never told me about it until I complained., no apology was offered."}
{"text":"Came to this place because I noticed it had 4 out of 5 stars. And I love trying local joints! This place is super cute, quite quirky decor to match the cute name. We got seated right away, not crowded but then again it's a Thursday morning. Our waitress really didn't have a personality. I notice there are 3 servers and the other two seem really attentive to there tables. 

Food was good, not overly impressed. The grandmas basket was cute a little different. Will I come back? Yes if I was in the area. Not gonna drive out of my way."}
{"text":"I brunched at this quaint little diner recently with a friend and was not disappointed. 

I ordered the corned beef hash and she, an omelette off the specials. Everything was great, and the warm little muffins were excellent! Make sure your order comes with the baker's basket.

Our server was very cheerful, and prompt. The atmosphere reminded me of eating breakfast at grandma's house, a happy feeling to be sure."}
{"text":"Had the meatloaf special, was very disappointed in the portion size, it was 1 very thin slice of meatloaf that fell a part and they put it back together on the plate. Maybe 4 bites.. My friend looked at it and was thinking the same thing I was... Got to be kidding me, it was very close to close, I think they should not of served it.."}
{"text":"Great little spot in Glendale!

If you hadn't noticed, the West side (make that all sides...) is a strip mall wonderland.  When I got to Kiss the Cook, I was pleasantly pleased to see that it was a free standing building (guess I'm easily impressed) with plenty of parking and even a cute patio!

The menu was full of typical breakfast favorites including omelets, pancakes, and hearty breakfast indulgences.  

5-star service!  Our coffee was never low and our water glasses were always replenished.  The decor inside was similar to my Michigan grandma's basement which made everything seem extremely relaxed.  As other Yelpers noted, the muffin basket is a highlight.  Once you order you are greeted with a little warm basket with several different types of miniature muffins of love.  mmm

I love that when you get your bill (cheap too by the way!), you are greeted with a real Hershey's kiss!  These are the touches that are always forgotten with chain restaurants

I know I will return-
totally worth a try if you are on this side of town"}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook is stellar in some ways and just misses the mark on others, which in my book rates it a solid four stars. I have been eating here since high-school and find this little family owned restaurant charming.

In addition to their regular menu (you can order breakfast or lunch any time), they always have three or four lovely specials. Generally, one is any omnivores dream, one takes fruit to a whole new level, and the other features one of their baked products done up to the nines.

My personal favorite is the \"build your own\" omelet. The ingredients are all super fresh, the omelet is always stuffed, and the house potatoes that are served on the side are very yummy (although I would like them done a little more on the crunchy side). My sisters favorite is the Snow Pea omelet. She swears it is the perfect combination of crunch and fluff!

Each meal starts out with a little basket of mini-muffin heaven. Alas the mini biscuits are no longer served, but man oh man are those zucchini muffins out of this world.

So you may be wondering, after all these raves, what are the down sides... well on occasion there is a little more butter on the bottom of the plate than I am comfortable with and although they are supposed to be famous, their sticky buns aren't all that special.

If you are looking for decent food, served with a smile, in a unique environment - you will definitely enjoy your visit to Kiss the Cook. Oh and there is that little chocolate kiss that leaves you wanting more...  : )"}
{"text":"Very vintage and cute! The food is so good including the fresh mini muffins provided before your meal! Zucchini is my fav! Really good omelets and potatoes, sweet customer service! It's a bit small so I'm not sure how they fit people in if their busy but well worth going!"}
{"text":"Solid place. 

It's a pretty down home breakfast spot in an iffy part of Glendale. We sat outside on the patio, much more comfortable than the crowded indoors, on a nice Winter Sunday (the only downside to being outside is some traffic noise which I think is tolerable).

Breakfast highlights were GREAT ham, pancakes, omelets.  Highly touted pecan sweet rolls and muffin basket were fine, but overhyped. Potatoes were fine but nothing special.  Prices are very reasonable. 

Oh, and the waitresses are super nice. Always tip well!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch today on our way home from outlet shopping. My mom had heard about it and so we decided to try it. Obviously lots of regulars as they all seemed to be known by the waitresses. It several minutes before we even got water and when our waitress did bring water she was less than friendly. No greeting and no offer to ask if we had questions or to tell us about the specials. I ordered a BLT and the bread was barely toasted. It came with a bag of Lays potato chips. My mom had the chicken salad over fruit and the fruit was not very good. Also came with a muffin which turned out to be Mini muffin. We then ordered the dessert special which was an apple dumpling and recommended by the waitress. It was okay but a little burnt! Lots of clutter and junky stuff as part of decor. Needless to say we won't travel to Glendale again to eat there but the locals will likely keep the place in business!"}
{"text":"The pancakes, waffles and muffins are all good delicious but the pancakes are some of the best - you know crisp buttery ends and all fluffy inside.  The sausage and bacon are also delicious and so are the home fries. 

You can't go wrong with this place for breakfast if you're on the westside but it's also popular so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Charismatic little diner with good service and good food & coffee. Will be back to keep enjoying a delicious fresh american breakfast menu. They were busy yet we sat down quickly and food came on time..."}
{"text":"I will keep this review short and sweet:

Come here. 

The staff was extremely friendly and attentive. The waffles, crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I ordered the biscuits and gravy (my wife had the waffles) and it was delicious. The biscuits were fluffy and not super dense like other places I have been. 

Oh, to top it off, you get a little \"Bakery Basket\" with a bunch of mini muffins. They were warm and scrumptious too. 

Usually, i write longer reviews, but I think this place should be experienced on your own. Just know, it is awesome (and seriously, get the waffles)!"}
{"text":"We took an Uber to the Fiesta Bowl and our driver pointed out Kiss The Cook as the best breakfast spot in Glendale. Not that I was looking, but KTC had not even been on my restaurant radar. Now, I'll be the first to criticize the Yelp community for having 400+ reviews of 'hip' breakfast joints but it's pulling teeth to get info on certain businesses or restaurants off the beaten path (generating user-content Yelpers, c'mon!) but not being aware of KTC and it's 100+ reviews is entirely on me there, friends. 

There was a short wait when we showed up from estate saleing on Saturday morning but the staff was friendly and had us in shortly. I had the New Orleans Omelette and Jenny had the special with the Maple Sausage. All the food was excellent, the service was excellent, and the prices were reasonable. Not a lot of bells and whistles (the mini muffins are a wonderful touch) but KTC is an elite down home breakfast restaurant. 

I can't stress enough how much every other \"country kitchen\" type restaurant can learn from KTC. Understated and over-performing if how I'd describe KTC. It's not the place I'll take my trendy out of town DINK friends after a night at [insert popular Scottsdale club with 600+ Yelp reviews], but it'll definitely be an upgrade for my Cracker Barrel & Denny's dining parents when they come to town."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here Sunday. It was such a great experience. Everyone was happy, and smiley. The food was great, and not pricey. They have very cute concepts such as the muffin baskets, and \"kisses\" they give you with your bill. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great food and a happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Loved this place lots of cute decorations good service awesome basket of muffins come free with your meal. The breakfast was great and the owner or chef was making homemade pumpkin butter while we were there. All said great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Fantastic little breakfast place!
Great food!
Mostly great service!
If you want a locally owned and operated breakfast tradition, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, but it can vary greatly by how good your waitress is. Also, if you order green chiles on an omelet it comes as a whole one on top--not diced as a stuffing inside. The baker's basket of mini-muffins is always great, but it would be nice to get an occasional blueberry one (they always seem to run out way too early)."}
{"text":"Even tho I had a bad customer experience, I can't deny  how good the food is....I love places that has Mom's homemade taste to it....and they have that....I love recommend....I do...I do"}
{"text":"I wish I could remember my servers name but she was awesome! Those warm mini muffins are delicious! Love this Glendale breakfast spot! Did I mention those muffins!"}
{"text":"Nice MA and PA business.  Our waiter was on point. He continously making sure we had everything we need. Unlike other waiters/waitress who only do it in the beginning. The muffins were moist and delicious. We ordered French toast with the Applewood bacon. They were cooked just right.  Our favorite breakfast place."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it makes me feel like I'm at home. Everything from the cute little nicknacks, to the basket of homemade muffins, to the homestyle cooking and to the service. Everything about this place says welcome home to grandmas house. Lol. Love this place! If you're looking for a 5 star classy restaurant then this might not be the place for you but if you are looking for an affordable home cooked meal the. Your at the right place!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait!

We just flew in from Atlanta so our bodies were ready for lunch but in AZ it's still breakfast time so thanks to Yelp we found this amazing place!

Do not let the outside appearance deter you...it's very quaintly decorated inside with an eclectic mix of antiques and baskets and mismatched furniture. We were thankful to be seated in the back corner at a cute antique round oak table where we could observe the happy customers being served by a very friendly, however, very busy staff since it was a Saturday morning. 

Their signature mini muffins served to every table were bran, zucchini and pineapple today and they make their own apple butter to go along with the butter served in the muffin basket. We were each able to taste all the flavors as our basket held six muffins. 

My husband ordered the breakfast special which was The Sonoran Pork Omelette with a chile verde sauce served with melted Monterey Jack cheese over the top. Since his initial craving was for Costa Vida this was a perfect brunch option and I had a hard time keeping my own fork off of his plate!  They literally whip their eggs to create the thickest fluffiest omelet we'd ever seen!  He also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which were very good with a sprinkling of table pepper although I personally like more flavor in my gravy, the biscuits were amazing. 

I ordered the Belgian waffle combo with blueberries which was served with the perfect over-medium eggs I requested and the most flavorful thick crisp bacon I think I've ever tasted. My only critique would be that for the cost of the berry option I would have thought there would be more than 20 small blueberries on my half of a waffle. 

Sandy was a very friendly and attentive server and was assisted by an equally friendly nearby server when our water glasses were close to empty. 

We would absolutely recommend this uniquely quaint restaurant if you ever find yourself anywhere near Glendale...about 15 minutes from the PHX airport."}
{"text":"I have now been here 3 times.  This place is sort of an icon in Glendale and I had been hearing that I had to go here since I moved here 17 years ago.

The first time I was here was Mothers Day. and I ordered the special breakfast of chicken crepes with a fruit bowl.  It was cold, the spinach had the texture of shoe leather, the Alfredo sauce had separated then formed a skin.  The fruit bowl it came with was ok as was the coffee and the mini muffins with butter were really good.'

The next time I went for lunch and had that day's special which was a  hot turkey sandwich with potato salad.  The sandwich was ok. The potato salad was bland but the seasoned salt on the table made it ok. 

This last time I had the Cooks breakfast of two pancakes, two eggs, two sausages (or bacon) and I added some potatoes.  The breakfast was lukewarm.  The pancakes and potatoes were pretty good, the eggs and sausage were just ok.  As noted before the mini muffins served with real butter were really good.

Ever body I encountered was pleasant.  The place is looking a bit worn.  When I was there the place was one to two thirds full.  I noticed this last trip the line of chairs and the coffee station outside were missing.  I fully understand that the banter between the waitresses and the regular customers is one of the things that brings people back, I just wish it didn't cause my food to be served lukewarm as I saw other plates served that were still steaming.

I gave it a 3 but it is a pretty weak 3 and although I would go there again if somebody else picked it I doubt it will make it into my regular rotation."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful family restaurant. The food is delicious, fresh and hot. It's comfort food with nice size servings. My husband, son and I ate breakfast/lunch there today.
Our waitress was warm and friendly. She was kind, welcoming and service was outstanding.
I ordered the seafood omelette with home fried potatoes and vanilla flavored coffee. My husband ordered the corned beef hash, fried eggs and home fried potatoes with coffee. 
My son ordered the special: chicken sliders with potato chips. Our friendly waitress brought us a hot from the oven basket of mini muffins. 
It was a treat to eat here and we will be back.
I loved the restaurant and dining area--it's very quaint and comfortable."}
{"text":"Good fresh and home cooked food. Loved breakfast especially biscuits and gravy Small quaint place that does get busy. Decent pricing."}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy!!! We found this place one Sunday while doing a google search because all of our regular places had too long of a wait and boy did we hit the jackpot! Very cozy local place with great service and good food! The staff is so friendly and nice and they truly care about how you are doing and how you like the food...such a nice change of pace. Meals come with a basket of mini muffins that are so good you'll have to be careful that you don't fill up before your meal comes out. I've had the Buttered Cinnamon Roll with Pecan's and I dream about it it's so good! Melts in your mouth, fresh and delicious :) I typically order the eggs benedict but we've tried the biscuits and gravy, pancakes and this past trip my friend had the crepes which were sensational! 

A great little spot worth the wait when there is one!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good service and love the decor....  So cute! I'll be back for the Cajun Eggs Benedict!!"}
{"text":"We drove quite a way to this restaurant because hubs wanted to try the Cajun Omelet. He was not disappointed and challenged his need for spicy. I had a the snow pea, mushroom, and water chestnut omelet. Three of my fav things and a very nice treat. The basket of muffins were fabulous and I'm embarrassed to say I hogged them all. Only 4 stars because hubs said the coffee was pretty weak."}
{"text":"Place is adorable we came in got a table right away than made our order 10-14 mins later two more tables are witted next to us and made their orders and got served before us I Order Huevos rancheros and yuck just not my cup of tea  everything on my plate was chop big chunks of potatoes big chunks of tomatoes and onions everywhere just could eat it of how moist the \"fried tortilla was \" the muffins are amazing the iced coffee was also outstanding the servers were really nice other than that just stay away from huevos rancheros ."}
{"text":"Great food. Great  service. The waffle was tasty. My Tom omelet was awesome. Our waiter was on top of everything.  We didn't need anything he's awesome.  We went to this  restaurant because we saw it on a TV show. the kids enjoyed the Hershey kiss at the end. We would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This rather seedy restaurant makes up for it in friendly good natured staff and delicious (breakfast) food. Have only eaten here twice, as a once-a-Year snowbird, and both experiences were very positive. The special this year was Cajun omelette which was indeed special, and the veggie eggs Benedict delivered. Don't wonder why you came, just salivate in anticipation!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! We were in town with our pup Maggie and saw this place is pet friendly. The food was delicious and the staff was very friendly. They had a dog menu which was so adorable. Thank you to everyone at Kiss the Cook"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Delicious food and great service!  I just wish I actually live here so I can go every weekend!"}
{"text":"First time here after passing it for years. Had the New Orleans Cajun omelette and it was great. Good friendly service."}
{"text":"Great little local place the portions are a good size and the prices are good I just had a pecan roll while it was a little dry on the outside packed a flavor punch. The wait staff was very friendly and efficient my coffee cup was never empty. I will definitely ruturn for a full breakfast"}
{"text":"Great coffee, delicious basket of muffins and biscuits and gravy. Courteous staff. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Loved this little joint! It's intimate but cute. I had the combo of eggs. Bacon and biscuits with gravy. The biscuits and gravy were outstanding! The eggs and bacon perfectly cooked and the coffee fresh!
Hubby went with an omelet and home fries which he enjoyed enough to not want me to have a bite of! Food hoarder! We met one of the original owners as he likes to visit with people. We had a nice discussion and I'm looking forward to going back again. They also give out a basket of muffins freshly made. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for a girls day on Sunday. The place is so cute inside, not at all what I expected from the outside. It is drenched in country decor, but in a good way. I love how stuff did not match perfectly, like the chairs and the plates.

They were actually closed when we arrived at 1:06 pm, but they gladly encouraged us to come in. The Hostess was a young lady that had a down to earth friendly personality and even complimented my daughter on her necklace. Our server was just as lovely and was very attentive the entire time.

I ordered the eggs benedict ($7.50) and my daughter ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough ($4.50). They delivered the delicious muffins that were mentioned in the previous post...we had banana nut and zucchini muffins and they were sooooo yummy.

The food came out in no time at all and was very very pleased with the benedict and the potatoes that came with. The eggs were perfectly poached and hollandaise sauce was delish.The potatoes were just like I make at home, perfectly seasoned with  little crispy pieces here and there. I was impressed because I have paid a lot more for this elsewhere and did taste nearly as good. The daughter's turkey sandwich was stacked high with thinly sliced turkey and cheese and she was also very satisfied. 

I will definetly return here and would recommend trying it if you are in the area. The service and the food were both great and that is no easy task."}
{"text":"Great omeletes! Service was a bit short handed; yet they did a marvelous job. VERY busy place; I can see why!"}
{"text":"This was the best Breakfast I have had in a long time. The food was so good I didn't even get a chance to take a picture. The server was a sweet elder lady and she made us feel comfortable and welcomed! I highly recommend Kiss the Cook!"}
{"text":"Got the oatmeal very good put nuts and granola in it and came with muffins . Old vibes"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee the food is good especially the eggs benedict place is always clean and friendly can't go wrong with the muffins also"}
{"text":"Pancakes are very good but as for everything else...... Quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 65."}
{"text":"Kiss the cook is a small, quaint- and I wanna say local but I'm not sure- breakfast/brunch restaurant in Glendale. A lot of their breakfast menu items come with a fresh basket of delicious muffins. 
I have tried the mushroom, ham and onion omelette and it tasted very good. The Cooks Combo is the best bang for your buck and comes with eggs, pancake, and sausage or bacon. Coffee and orange juice are both decent.
Serive is consistently good but they are pretty busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  So make sure to go early or call to put your name on the list. We once waited 20 min outside in the Phoenix summer heat."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT and known for their PANCAKES!! Amazing! All breakfast items are very good including their omelettes. Don't go to a restaurant that specializes in breakfast and expect their lunch to be good. Went there one time for lunch and would've rather had a sandwich from a hospital cafeteria. Eight years of going there for breakfast. Great price and serving sizes."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and think today was my last. 

They have a great idea here, the older sweet servers, antique furniture and decor - overall ambiance.

The food has been good enough for me to visit on more than one occasion but nothing I've ever been to crazy about. 

On my visit today, I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my girlfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy. My food came out cold and I sent it back, wasn't apologized to or checked back up on. I was on the fence about this place already and that tipped it. You are a restaurant - one job. Make good food and if it isn't - make it right! You guys had a wonderful opportunity to have me come back again in the future, but when I told the cashier about my experience it gets even better!!

When I told her about my poor service she basically said sorry and cut me off to find our server to make sure we were charged properly for my girlfriends turkey sausage. She spent more time trying to make sure we were being charged for the sausage than our experience. 

Biscuits and gravy were good though! I would recommend checking something else out - seems like quite a few yelpers agree."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, great service, great food,  the Biscuits and Gravy are the best I have had in AZ.  The Omelet was phenomenal.  We will definitely return! OFTEN."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times whenever I visit Arizona. Out of all the places I've been to, this joint stood out the most! It's probably because of their wonderful basket of delicious mini muffins! I seriously loved all of them and could have finished a whole basket by myself easily! They had lemon poppy, pistachio, and cinnamon? I think.  The first 2 were my favs. 

Service
It wasn't super busy when we came, which was a Saturday afternoon around 12. The waiter that took our order was really nice and funny! I forgot his name.. He was also really attentive so thank you for that! He refilled our water without us asking, checked up on us, cracked a couple jokes. It was nice for us out of town people. 

Food
You MUST get the Cajun eggs Benedict. It's the right amount of spicy, and was super amazing! 
Biscuits and gravy- it didn't have any sausage and was okay... I didn't really care for it. 
Yogurt parfait- loved the fruits and yogurt! Really refreshing. 
Pecan pancake? I forgot the name. It was drowned in some sweet liquid/syrup. I had a bite and it was Waaaay too sweet for me and I love sweet! Maybe better for dessert rather than breakfast/brunch. 

Super cheap for 6 people compared to Cali! It was $60 without tip... Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. The restaurant is eclectic and fun, similar to Cracker Barrel but more unique. Our waiter was STEVEN and he did an excellent job. Kept coffee and water filled. I had the Cook Combo which was perfect. Eggs Benedict sauce was kind of different tasting... probably won't get that again. 
One of the earlier reviews said it was dusty inside but I didn't see a speck of dust anywhere. We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's Saturday, mid-morning. You just woke up, your stomach is rumbling, and you decide that you're in the mood to go out for some brunch. Somewhere with a typical diner menu like Denny's, Waffle House, or IHOP would probably be good, but you're wanting to try something new. You're craving that warm comfort of a mom-and-pop diner that you just don't get at a chain restaurant. Look no further, because Kiss the Cook fits the bill! Kiss the Cook is a classic, eclectic restaurant near downtown Glendale that offers great food, a unique environment, and even better service. Winning the award for best breakfast from the popular and respected \"Phoenix New Times\" magazine on more than one occasion, Kiss the Cook is a restaurant that will have you coming back to satisfy your hunger many Saturdays to come."}
{"text":"Came hungry and left happy, full, and knowing I will be back! Great atmosphere, service was awesome, and food was exactly what I wanted."}
{"text":"AWESOME!!
Pros
Service was unbeatable!
Super friendly!
Food was great with good portions.
Prices are fairly inexpensive.

Cons
A lot of decor on the wall 

Overall awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast, not expensive. First time there and I will go back. Breakfast was big and coffee was good."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Superb service and wonderful food. We discovered this place about 5 years ago but had never ate lunch there always  breakfast. The lunch is every bit as good as the breakfast. This is a must do every time we are in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Just the best place. The food is outstanding, especially the complimentary zucchini muffins. The Service is great too. We were third in line and only waited a few minutes. Would have been even faster if it weren't for two rude twenty something women with a baby. When we walked in they had finished their meal, and their check was on the table. But they sat there visiting for at least another 40 minutes oblivious to other customers waiting for a table. Where does this generation get off thinking that the world revolves around them and to heck with the wait staff that needs to earn a living. If I weren't worried about being arrested I would have yanked them out of their chairs by their hair! BRATS"}
{"text":"Solid choice for breakfast in downtown Glendale.

Kiss the Cook has been around since I can remember and it was always a place my mom would take us for a girly breakfast or lunch. Once my dad caught on to the fluffiness of their omelets it became a family favorite.

It had been years since I had been back but the husband and I were in the mood for breakfast and since we are westsiders and slow to wake up on the weekend we knew we wouldn't be able to make it to the east valley to try something different.  Matt had never been to Kiss the Cook so it seemed like the perfect choice, the fact that there was a meat lover's omelet on special confirmed that choice. When he asked to sub the green onions in the omelet for something else, he was greeted with enthusiasm and encouragement from the waitress, \"Yes! you are paying for it, might as well have something you like in it!\"  This instantly won over my husband who often asks to sub or omit ingredients.

The baker's basket is a great touch and I have always had great friendly service. Our food came out promptly, fresh, and our drinks never ran dry. Best part we were in and out in 35 minutes which helped us still be able to enjoy a full day of errands, despite not rolling out of bed until 10am."}
{"text":"I went here about a week ago with the boy for breakfast. It was a cloudy day here in Phoenix, and we made the mistake of sitting out on the covered patio. It would have been LOVELY since it was nice and cool outside, but after we received our drinks (me, iced tea; the boy, freshly squeezed oj) and our basket o' mini muffins, it started to POUR.

The \"covering\" thing they have over the patio is more of a mesh to filter sunlight, as opposed to an actual solid covering type material. Our table starting to get super wet. We were sitting next to another couple who decided they were going to stick it out and finish their breakfast, but since the boy and I hadn't received our actual meals yet, we decided to check and see if we could sit inside.

They were happy to give us a table inside, and actually made a few jokes about how crazy we were to sit out there in the first place considering how cloudy/stormy it looked. We received our food shortly after being seated on the INSIDE of the restaurant. The boy got the farm special? country special? something like that, it came with pancakes, scrambled eggs, and sausage. I got whatever the other special was that was DELICIOUS potatoes, biscuits and gravy, bacon and scrambled eggs.

Our breakfast was wonderful. I loved how all the dishes and everything we mismatched, a very cute country look. Our server was fantastic. I'm sure we'll go back again. :)"}
{"text":"This place is great, the parking lot was full and no surprise as to why. We were amazed with our waiter, he was quite attentive and three good was so delicious! The best part were the tiny muffins, while you wait, hit the spot with the coffee! We will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Poor service and food was mediocre at best. The side of potato was about the only thing I ate that was good and they show no love to veterans or military families."}
{"text":"I can go anywhere I want to eat breakfast and unfortunately I chose Kiss the Cook this morning.  Coffee was awful.  Waited a long, long time for our food which was delivered cold.  I don't ever send anything back to the kitchen.  I also don't go back to a restaurant for bad service and cold food.  As the waitress was profusely apologizing and taking ownership that she dropped the ball regarding our breakfast, her cell phone rang loudly from her waitress apron which clarified her priorities at her job.  I won't sign their petition to prevent the light rail from coming to downtown Glendale.  We deserve better options for dining In Glendale.  The waitress wasn't some clueless teenager, she simply sucks at her job."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant with great food and service. Will go again if ever in town again."}
{"text":"Our 2nd. sat. ladies choose a different place every month. We went to Kiss the Cook today. Had a very nice young man wait on us. Food was good,  service fast and best of all coffee cups kept full. Reason for 4 stars is food and service. Would have given 5 but need to do something with restrooms. Not a very nice snell when you go in. Clean but yucky odor."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place since I was a little girl and let me tell you if you really want good breakfast and brunch I would recommend coming here. It's great for groups, bringing you're significant other or you're family here. There food is so delicious especially there little mini muffins but in the menu I recommend the toasted wheat B.L.T sandwich with egg overhard inside the sandwich with a side of lays chips. Omg it's so yummy but other stuff on the menu is also yummy as well. Also the servers are great but if you want someone very reliable & fast I would ask for Steven or Michelle. And if you ever go on the weekends I would call in and tell them to put you on the waiting list so you don't have to wait long when you get there. But overall if want a good food for breakfast and brunch I would come here Cause this place is the best."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place to support local small businesses...however, the food was not all that exciting.  The best part of the meal were the mini-muffins.  It went downhill after that.  I ordered the Cajun eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked nicely but the Cajun sauce just didn't taste right.  When I was in NOLA the sauce had a much better flavor and depth.  This one missed the spot.  The kielbasa tasted more like hot dogs.  
Sad to say, if it weren't for the muffins, I would have only given 1 star.  The mini muffins are worth a trip but that's it."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Hubby and I decided to go someplace different for breakfast. The restaurant has the ambiance like Cracker Barrel when you walk in, old fashioned restaurant. The people are nice servers actually talk to you and check on you to refill drinks. The mini Muffins are to die for and the food as well. We had the pancakes, apple bacon and sausage links with potatoes. Very delicious. We will be returning again!!"}
{"text":"Great value and service, all the staff were very sweet. Food was just okay - I got the pancakes and they were a little raw in the middle and burnt on the outside. Probably best thing were the breakfast potatoes but nothing else really stood out."}
{"text":"It took forever to get seated. And then I couldnt get waited on.

I was second in line and two tables were open. More tables opened up. I asked to be seated but the hostess was one of those anal types who could not multitask. She let 10 people gather before seating anyone.

After being seated I waited and waited. Three waitresses walked by but still no service. Got fed up and left. I think it is typical for a single woman to get less attention than when she is with a man. Should have brought Big Poppa, I guess.

Kiss the Cook has always had so-so service but the good food keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"This dog-friendly restaurant is amazing! The food is incredible and so is the service! The dog friendly porch iusually isn't open on weekdays but they opened it up for me and my cockapoo. They even made him scrambled eggs in a dog dish. Will most certainly be back with or without my pooch. The seafood omelette was fabulous!"}
{"text":"03/19/10

Kitschy, fun country-life decor.  There was about a 15-minute waiting time.  Lots of older citizens waiting, which made for interesting chit-chat amongst the women.  It's refreshing when a restaurant's setting allows people to feel comfortable enough to interact among strangers-- Mom and I encounter so many \"closed\" individuals on a daily basis at work, so this is a nice change of pace for us.  Staff here seem friendly and busy, but efficient.  At least, ours was.  One complaint: it's a bit cramped in here.  It would be nice to have a little privacy from other neighboring tables, especially when I spied a room in the back that had maybe four 4-tops, and only one was occupied.

Can't recall what Mom ordered, but I wasn't surprised that she didn't enjoy it-- the menu description definitely did not appeal to me.  Website does not list a menu, and all I can recall is that it was an omelet w/ a couple of fibrous veggies (snow peas and something else; it was a strange combo, of that I'm sure of.  Chestnuts, maybe?).  I went w/ a Belgian waffle, two eggs, and bacon.  Coffee was weak, but our server offered to brew a stronger pot.  Nice!  While we waited for our selections, she brought out some mini-muffins to enjoy, and that we did!  We both really liked the bran.  I also enjoyed the zucchini-- Mom thought she detected cinnamon (not a fave of hers), but I think it's the nutmeg she was referring to.  Then again, I may be mistaken...

Waffle was, well, a waffle.  No accompanying fruit compotes or coulis to liven things up.  I always bring my own 100% organic maple syrup, because while most restaurants say they offer maple syrup, it isn't 100% pure, but a blend of maple and corn syrups.  (If it smells like Mrs. Butterworth's, it isn't 100% maple.  Just sayin'.)  Eggs were cooked to over-medium, just that way I like 'em.  Bacon was very nice.

Cute saucer and dinner plates, lovely mini-muffins (we bought extra to-go!), good bacon, and efficient service make for a solid two stars.  I wouldn't mind giving KTC another try, if we're in the area.  Next time we'll try the pancakes and crepes!"}
{"text":"First off thank you for a kind and happy breakfast staff!!! Second thank you for having eggs Benedict at a normal price and a normal flavor!

This place really has it when it comes to the \"homemade\" meal. I like the new super \"Starbucks\" type of new age places but I feel they put all the money into the facade and loose it in the food, quality, and staff. 

Without the constant bean counters and investors sitting over your shoulder this place has the time to make your food to order. The staff is kind and very helpful too. Also great coffee constantly refilled. 

There was a small problem with our meal and within 5 minutes there was a replacement plate and some extra stuff to take home. :)

All things considered this was a great dining experience and I would recommend this place and its people to serve you great meals! 

Love it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was Superb! Waited less than 5 minutes for breakfast on a Sunday and never had an empty cup of coffee. Portions were perfect and prices are reasonable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a true home town favorite. I have been going here ever since I was a little girl. The food here is delicious and has the real home cooked style, the little bran muffins are my favorite! I really feel at home when eating here! Especially with all the mix matched dishes :)"}
{"text":"Great Food & Great Service all for the Perfect Price.

Kiss the Cook offers you the small town feel of your local breakfast cafe but with this country hospitality through the nick-knacks and woven baskets for sell. The menu offers the basics of any small town brunch style restaurant and for the quality, I'd say the price is unbeatable. One of their trademarks seems to be their small muffins, and I'll admit they are pretty darn good! Not the only thing I'd come here for by any means but defiantly never have a problem eating the ones they sit in front of me ;)

One thing to keep caution for is the wait. The parking lot is rather small and the restaurant is much smaller.. so even on a typical weekday for brunch you'll find yourself waiting 30 minutes or longer"}
{"text":"Great breakfasts place! I love it it's so unique and made from scratch it's so affordable $10 per person with free muffins love it! The waiter was great  one of them was not so great she was the cashier but everything was great I bought a mug pricey but it's koo :)  the cooks combo rocks!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. The pancakes are delicious. The staff and atmosphere were absolutely terrific. You can actually Kiss the Cook. A table next to me had the Chef come out, gave him a huge hug and kiss on the cheek.  The restaurant clapped and cheered!  What a wonderful memory  : )"}
{"text":"I had been waiting to try breakfast at this place for awhile. We visited on a Sunday around 11am. Waited about 15 minutes. As soon as we walked in, we were not greeted. Then the lady finally said \"what's your name and how many?\". After we gave her the info she never said anything else she just ignored us like we weren't standing there then asked the next person the same thing. I thought it was very rude to be honest and I wanted to leave but my boyfriend wanted to try the food also. The waitress was nice. The food took some time to come out. Muffins were nothing special. You don't get much food. I ordered the huevos rancheros and I took one bite and did not touch the rest. They had huge tomatoes in there with oinions and big pieces of bell peppers which I never seen on huevos rancheros. All I ate was the potatoes which tasted like bacon or sausage (This is a problem because I dont eat pork). We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am happy to live close again because now we can enjoy Kiss the Cook's awesome muffin basket, great service and delicious food at a good price. We have been eating here for years and we're always impressed. I love the eggs Benedict so much...I literally want to kiss the cook! If my wife will let me. And if the cook is female. If not then my wife has a kiss for the cook? Let's just say we highly recommend Kiss the Cook."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday afternoon 1ish, hubby and i woke up way late lol, and we wanted some good breakfast food. Got on yelp and found kiss the cook. probably would not have stopped if I hadn't found it on here. The building is kind of older and not a big eye catcher. The inside is really nice and cozy though. got the food to go, took it home and was pleasantly surprised at just how much food we got for the money we spent."}
{"text":"Went there recently on a Saturday afternoon because of some research here on yelp.  I love breakfast food even though I have it about once a month.  I could not complain about my experience whatsoever, great food, great prices, good service, and a cozy atmosphere.  Definitely not the Denny's experience which I thought this place would be.  My only complaint is the location, I enjoy downtown Glendale, but this place is a little ways from it next to tattoo parlors and check cashing stores.  Wish it was downtown so I could enjoy the shops after a scrumptious meal.  Overall this place is worth a shot!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister in law and nephew. Ha we had just left a different restaurant because we weren't fond of their food. Checked Yelp and this place came up. It's very cute on the inside and they have outside sitting (not that you'd want too in 117° weather). They have a covered patio where customers can wait. 

As far as the seating, it was quick even though it was busy and extremely small on the inside. Our server was polite and friendly and I really appreciate that about busy businesses. 

The food was really good and the apple smoked bacon was huge and crispy. The pancakes had a great flavor to it. I didn't have coffee but I noticed they serve coffee in clear glasses. I thought that was cool.

Anyway... overall good experience and will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time. Took my mom and my 8 year old son.  We waited a while for a table but it wasn't terrible for Sunday morning. The waitress was nice. My food was OK, my over-medium eggs were a little overcooked. My mom had a waffle and she liked it. My son had pancakes eggs and bacon.  He said the scrambled eggs tasted funny and so he only ate a couple of bites. Six hours later here he is throwing up and having diarrhea. Sounds like food poisoning to me. Those scrambled eggs must have been bad.  **UPDATE:  My son is doing better today, but my mother was nauseous this morning.  We hadn't been together until yesterday at brunch in a few weeks so there is no way they passed any type of virus from one to the other that quickly -- this must have been the food.  Disappointing because this place gets 4 stars on Yelp."}
{"text":"I was pleased with my food - basic breakfast - but others in the group were disappointed because they were comparing it to their favorite Bobos in Tucson.  The host was completely lost.  The waitress was good.  The basket of muffins bland."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday morning around 10:30. I did call ahead seating and when we arrived there was no wait.  The food was fantastic and incredibly reasonable. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The place has a tone of clutter. It's like your grandmas house threw up in there. There is a ton of dust on the clutter. That was a big turn off. We were  recommended their pancakes and biscuits and gravy and they ended up being bad. We did not finish our food and when they asked we let them know how we felt about the food. They brushed it off like we didn't know what we were talking about. 
I do not recommend this place at all. Everything was subpar."}
{"text":"Can't beat their Cajun omelette. Absolutely the best breakfast for the money anywhere in the Phoenix area. I wouldn't be afraid to bring anyone here."}
{"text":"Had my egg benedict and loved it!! Priced well and plate comes in big portion nicely decorated and yammie!!
Atmosphere of antique place with welcoming staff. 
Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in AZ and don't forget the bakers basket. The atmosphere is fun and old fashion country style. The home made cookies at the register are amazing, don't pass them up. The egg creations each day are unique and well worth a try."}
{"text":"What a find! It's as though Gramma (yes, \"Gramma\" is synonymous for ALL grandmothers) opened up her kitchen to the public and can make you anything you desire... within reason of course.

The decor is quaint and well done, the staff is sassy and friendly, and the food is epic!! I'm so glad I stumbled upon them."}
{"text":"Ok guys! I seriously cannot hey enough of this place. If I could I would eat this every day for breakfast. The mini muffins are to die for. The customer service reminds me of back home (Texas). The French toast & eggs Benedict are some of my favs. I crave this place daily!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Kiss the Cook. It is the cutest little place for breakfast and I love going here.

The quaint little restaurant is decorated with country antiques and most of them are for sale. It reminds me of a place you would find in Prescott.

I have had a few things on the menu and have always been delighted. The coffee is a little week, but then again, I start each day with a quad espresso so it may be unfair for me to judge.

While you wait for breakfast they bring out a variety of VERY tasty muffins and bread... so, so tasty!!!!

Good service and prices. No complaints from me :)"}
{"text":"This place has a back woods diner kind of feel, It's cute! But the food is nothing special. Muffins we pretty good though..."}
{"text":"This place was around the corner from me and I HATED it, I craved their buttermilk pancakes, although everything is good here my go-to meal has always been The Cook's Combo.

I hope Guy (of Diner, Drive-Ins and Dives) never finds out about this place, it would be impossible for us \"regular\" folks to get a seat if he does."}
{"text":"Best pancakes everrrr! Like even better than IHOP! 
I love the interior. It makes me feel like I'm at Grandma's house. 
Love the mini muffins before the meal!
HUGE portions for a reasonable price!

The line is just always so loooong!
But worth the wait!"}
{"text":"First time at Kiss the Cook. It was busy but they have coffee available while you wait. I got seated pretty quickly since I was by myself. Food and service was good. They don't give out the WiFi password apparently so if you are dining alone, bring a book."}
{"text":"Aw we love this place! The waitresses are so nice and personable. They take time out to talk to you. They seem to know the \"regulars\". I like that, gives a small town feel in a big city. The food is really good, better than home cooked!"}
{"text":"Pecan cinnamon roll was amazing & there bacon was great according to my husband.  Eggs were good & so was the french toast.  Great ambiance with the antiques everywhere.   Nice place to go try & have a good meal & relax."}
{"text":"Great service, fun atmosphere, awesome food, decor is fun and the entire place reminds me of a comfy morning at grandma's house..... but with even better food! If you go on a Saturday or Sunday make sure to arrive early!! They have a lot of \"regulars\" that make the experience even better!!"}
{"text":"I am a Kiss the Cook fan.  Pretty much everyone I know in Glendale is too.  I guess it's just a Glendale thing. But the food is similar to any of the other breakfast joints, but I think it's slightly better here. Not better than Chompies mind you, but better than the Good Egg.

They're only open for breakfast and lunch, but I've only ever had their breakfast items.  They have the best pancakes, scrambled eggs and waffles.  YUM.

They're reasonably priced too, so you can take the whole fam and still not break the bank."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint, Route 66 kind of place, kind of like going back in time... Down to Earth friendly kind of people... Ordered the Cajun omelette and the cream crepes with fruit, great great presentation and yummy too!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. It's right up the street from me and I was hoping it could be my new breakfast spot I could do my work at. The decor is really cute and country. There population of customers were mostly elderly, getting the feeling they are regulars and have been coming to this spot for years. My server was friendly and prompt. I asked for suggestions and she gave me an idea on what is best here. The wifi wasn't accessible, they didn't have the password. I ordered the eggs Benedict. It was drenched in  sauce so so so bad the biscuit was soggy and I had a hard time distinguishing any other flavors outside the hollandaise sauce. I thought, well geez they just make it that way and then as I tried to stomach this dish noticed a lady next to me had ordered the same thing and hers was not swimming in hollandaise sauce. If my waitress had been paying attention maybe she could have prevented the order from coming out or if she would have taken some time to ask how everything was she could have learned about how displeasing this dish truly was."}
{"text":"I'm trying exceptionally hard to be nice here.  Hence, the three stars rather than negative stars and I'll get into why they deserve three stars and not five stars.  What saves this place from negative stars or a one star.  They are a local breakfast brunch location that serves up something a bit different from your standard same 'ol same 'ol breakfast eateries or diners.

What sets KTC apart from the rest, is the home style feel - like a quilted cottage with frilly things about and hanging wicker baskets.  I feel like I'm intruding whenever I'm eating here - as if three bears were to waltz on in and it would be a Papa bear, mama bear, and a baby bear.  The baby bear being the winiest of the three, but I concur why after breaking his dang chair and eating all of his food - who wouldn't get mad?  I'd be Pi$$ed.

Anywho.  The muffin baskets?  Whaaaattt?  And they're absolutely delicious and to die for!  That deserves a star and a half right there.  The waitress staff are the golden girls and they know how to charm each and everyone one of them.  On their breaks, they crotchet more decorations for the rest of the place.  It's ongoing, and it never ends.

Service is great.  Seriously, a bit crammed - in fact, waaaay too crammed which leads me to why this place is getting the review of 3 stars.
I started my first job in the fast food industry and moved myself up to working at local restaurant's and steak houses - bussing tables before serving. 

If you have a popular location that is crammed, than you have to make up for it with efficient turn-around times on your tables.

Bussing tables.  It's not really hard.  It's not really that difficult.  And it's seriously.....did I say, not that hard?  So, KTC restaurant seriously....I'm not sure if they hire developmentally challenged kids from a local boys and girls club (I'm trying my hardest not to be insensive but I already ruined it with the Golden girls reference, so what the heck right?) anyway.....I've never in my wildest imagination, can make up the time it took for one busser guy (you only had one job pal....one job.  ONE JOB) and still manages to screw it up.) bussed one table outside - about a 4 top round table - about 6 drinking glassware, assorted plates about 6, a coffee mug, some food scraps, napkins, etc.  Nothing too crazy.  27 minutes.  

TWENTY SEVEN FREAKING MINUTES.  Did he leave to crotchet with the other girls?  Was he busy elsewhere?  Did he transform into a fixed street lamp on the corner waiting for nothing?  Excuses.  Once you start bussing a table, bus it until it's done, get it ready and prepped for the waiting bazillion people for the love of god!  This guy, seriously, took one glass with both hands...moved it to a cocktail tray that could hold no more than 4 glasses that he set outside a plastic garbage dumpster with lid - than, proceeded to lurch himself towards the table for aaaaannnnnnoooooooootttttttttthhhhhhhhhhhhhheeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrr glllllaaaassss ccccccuuuuuupppppp.  By the time you were done reading that part, he would have been only halfway reaching for that glass cup.  Yeah, no joking here folks.  My jaw dropped.  He had help from a Golden girl, but she couldn't do all the work for him.  My lovely wife informed me, \"maybe they just don't have bus tubs...\" I was like, \"yeah...buuuuutt\" and as she said that.....Another busser from inside came outside and he had a bus tub.  I was like, okay....so, they have just that one slow guy right?  Wrong.  Even bus tub busser was having a hard time helping out cleaning the table.  Seriously?  They would leave entirely and not return until later and take a glass off or two.  Inside, was probably ten minutes faster, but they left tables open with an hour and half wait - seriously?  What is Beavis and Butthead doing?  Why is there no sense of urgency to clear a freaking table - you're losing customers or their patience. 

Okay, I'm fine......seriously, we finally got seated after my children had already grown older and we no longer needed any children's menus.  They were adults now.

Good, we could have that chat that I been meaning to talk to them about.  My girls WERE 4 and 6.  Were.  

Seriously Kiss the Cook - you guys have something special going on.  The food is excellent and you guys do honor Entertainment book coupon, and have such nice staff.  You have a cozy place but your parking sucks.  (hint to those driving around in circles in the parking lot - go to the lot just west of you; you're going to have to leave the parking lot first and than go to the street and go back into the 50,000,000 sq ft empty lot that is mere feet from the actual restaurant) - walk a foot or two, it aint going to kill you peeps.) 

But, clean off those tables and get things turned around quicker...seriously!  It could be sooo much better and I want it to be.  I'll be back again with a coach's whistle and stop watch  on my next visit.


Seriously, bussers only have ONE JOB.....ONE!!!!"}
{"text":"First time I have been there in years. My breakfast was pretty good and reasonably priced. Coffee was great with Sugar in the Raw (a great condiment). The pecan cinnamon roll was very yummy. We were there at 11:45am and were seated right away, drinks delivered, order taken, and food delivered within minutes. Overall...Thumbs Up!"}
{"text":"Do not go here.The service is awful, no one comes to table, others got served first, no water,no utensils, after 45 mins, we gave our order & eggs & potatoes were not cooked, corn beef hash was from a can, not cooked, never go back, no one helped us!!
Place does not care.  The review is true, so correct the problem,DO NOT be Mean to the Reviewer"}
{"text":"Food:  Good.  Their muffin basket with mini muffins is really yummy.  3 different kinds, baked fresh.  They give you the basket with so much butter packets I was shocked.  But it was funny enough to take a picture.  Pancakes are Superb.  Light, fluffy, the right temperature, not DRY, and not too soggy... YUM!!!  Their famous potatoes are pretty good, not the best but pretty good.  Regular eggs are ok.  The omelettes are fluffy. The egg yolk ones are firm, the egg white ones are a little too fluffy almost runny.  They have a bunch of other options on the menu like make your own omelettes, huevos rancheros, sandwiches.  Not overally oily.
Price:  Decent.  About $5 for 2 eggs, muffins, 2 biscuits with gravy, gradmas potatoes.  About $7 to $8 for make your own omelette.  
Decor:  I love the ambience here, it is really quaint, not old scary really nostalgic, but more prairie, baskets hanging, green vines, white linen, and daisy flower kind of feel.  Has a patio
Service:  Very good.  Super nice and attentive.  Fast service.  Ask us if we needed anything a lot."}
{"text":"Average food, small portions and overpriced.
The service was good, cute setting. I am not sure that it's worth returning though"}
{"text":"A \"home cooked\" meal. No frills, not much for spices but a  decent breakfast. Mom had the 3 egg omelet which was full of her 3 toppings, good portion. I had the country breakfast with scrambled eggs & cheese & added a side of crispy bacon. Both were good. Comes with biscuit & gravy & potatoes, though they forgot my potatoes (they were brought after I asked). B & G were nothing to get excited about, though we may be B & G snobs but there wasn't much flavor & they had a cafeteria style to them. Hubby ordered the \"hay stack\" & was hugely disappointed & underwhelmed. It is a layer of hash browns topped with choice of eggs, sausage links, more hash browns topped with country gravy & a sprinkle if cheese. We were expecting a generous portion of goodness & it was in a little crock dish :-( Thankfully our portions were generous so we shared eggs & potatoes & half my biscuit to fill him up.
Server was extremely kind & attentive though a little slow overall outside. With the many choices the area has to offer, likely we won't return."}
{"text":"Place is cute. I ordered country dish and the gravy had no flavor. Second order was green chile guevo rancheros were good."}
{"text":"I've been going here occasionally and the food has always been great. My favorite is the Cajun Benedict! The staff is super friendly and the bakers basket is bomb! Would definitely recommend going here, but it can get busy in the mornings. Otherwise great breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I'm spending time at my grandma's house. Waitresses are sweet as pie and make you feel like you are their kids/grandkids. Plenty of options on the menu including three kinds of Eggs Benedict! Not the cheapest meal in town but I'll pay a little extra for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Kiss The Cook has one of the best (if not the best) eggs benedict I have ever had, given that I'm a huge fan of eggs benedict. The gravy is amazing! Sausage is not too salted (which is usually the case at other places) and eggs are perfectly poached in a way that yolk is still runny but doesn't spill all out when cut. The mini muffins offered before the meals are ridiculously delicious - not too sweet, not too oily, and not to filling. I would definitely come back if I visit Arizona again."}
{"text":"Another great Yelp discovery! We were looking for a breakfast place within easy driving distance of the stadium and thought we'd give Kiss The Cook a try. Super homey little restaurant with tons of nick nacks on the walls. Not in a corporate chain kind of way but in a grandma's house if your grandmother was a bit of a hoarder way. It was all very cute. Although the place was packed we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The waitress was incredibly nice and efficient. Everything on the menu looked appetizing. I settled on the special of pork chops and eggs, the pork chop was really well seasoned. The coffee was even good. I find most restaurant coffee to be too weak but it was just about perfect. Also I should add that they gave us a basket of freshly baked mini muffins for an appetizer. Any place that does that is okay by me."}
{"text":"Kiss the cook is one of those places where it seems like a 50/50 chance that you will either have a good experience or an OK one. Judging by the initial reviews you would think this place is the go to breakfast place.  That isn't the case.  Its OK.  Nothing special nothing great.

First off the service is lousy.  I have been told that you should always tip the most at breakfast.  Why?  There is something about going to a place and seeing empty tables that erks me when the hostess puts your name down and there is a wait.  Be it 5 minutes or 20 if there are empty tables sit the customer down.  I know that they try to evenly distribute customers to waitress for tips and what not but give me a break.  This place is not that big.  To be fair when we finally sat down our waitress was pretty nice.  

After seating it took about ten minutes for the waitress to take our order.  I got the corn beef and hash and my fiance got the kiss the cook special.  The corn beef was good.  The portion size however was maybe a scoop full.  Kind of disappointing.  It came with two eggs and potatoes.  Again portion size not too great.  The food was good though I like the southwest seasoning that you can put on it.  My fiance got 2 eggs 2 pancakes and sausage.  Her pancakes were pretty thick and the eggs looked good.  It was perfect portion for her.  The food came with a mini muffin basket which was cool and apple butter.  The coffee looked a little watered down but overall tasted OK.  They didn't have splenda but sweet and low was fine.  

Overall the experience was not much different then Denny's or village inn.  The food was OK nothing fancy.  This is either a place that you will absolutely love or just say ehh.  If your in the mood for a big breakfast don't come here.  If you want to leave filling just right this is the place."}
{"text":"Love this place. Everyone so friendly, food very good. I have ordered pies, they are delicious, plus saves me from having to make them. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"This was my dad's go to breakfast place when he lived in this part of the Valley. 

He loved all things breakfast there.. but especially eggs benedict. 

When I went to visit, I always got an omelet. Huge and yummy. 

Coffee? not bad. Not Portland, but not bad."}
{"text":"After all these years, I finally came and tried this establishment.  The parking spaces were limited.  Watch where you park!   

A long line was already out the door waiting for a table. Why are brunch places always so busy?  The decor reminded me of Glendale's antique shops. They have a bunch of baskets hanging and other random items surrounded the restaurant. Its interesting decor. 

Upon entering the restaurant, there was a strong burnt odor in the dining area.  I'm assuming their vents weren't working. 

I had the Country Breakfast with 2 eggs, biscuits & gravy, and fried potatoes. The biscuits & gravy didn't taste fresh and homemade. Fried potatoes were basically scorched.  They were tasteless and hard.  It helped when you sprinkle with plenty of black peppers.

The staff was efficient and friendly.  I love a place still give out free warm muffins. I would return just to order the basket of muffins. It was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast special.  I am visiting from out of town and read some great reviews for their breakfast here.  I was not disappointed.  Great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy food! They gave us Hersey kisses with our check!  Adorable country-store like decor"}
{"text":"So you have to love breakfast.  It is a great meal that really begs for creativity.  There are so few places that have creative breakfasts (Palette was one) but most places just do the standard fare.  That would be Kiss the Cook.  Nothing special about it.  No magic applewood smoked turkey sausage with kumquat glaze, no french waffels - just your standard stuff.  They do it well though.  Think of it as basic breakfast without the grease.  

The waitresses are great and have a ton of personality.  They really make this place a Four Star establishment.  The mini muffins that come before your meal is always a saving grace and they are the perfect size to tide you over till your food arrives.  That being said, your food won't take too long and you will get plenty of it.  

I tried the french toast with a side of ham.  The toast was decent; with a hint of cinnamon.  Nice but not amazing.  The ham was a really good size and it tasted damn good.  The fresh squeezed OJ wasn't as good as Matt's but it was better than something from a carton. 

I'd go back here if I was out in Glendale for breakfast.  A great place with a ton of character.  The food isn't overwhelming but it is good enough for breakfast."}
{"text":"The country plate taste excellent with great flavor and plenty of food. Great prices for what you're getting. Waitresses were all pleasant and attentive. Only bad thing we experienced at the time was the ranchero sauce sucks."}
{"text":"This place is the cutest ever. Very antiquey. Lolz. Buckets, bins and basket as a decors. The tables and chairs are old, country and vintage style, it coordinate with the place so well. 
Omggg. The muffin is to die for. We killed it once it hit the table. Haha. It was so fresh and hot off the oven.
Our waitress Mercy was so kind and didn't mind that my nephew Ky made a mess. Lolz. The food was on point and everything was glorious :) highly recommended.

 Perfer CASH FOR TIP."}
{"text":"Had the basic eggs and sausage.  Undercooked and sausage was way too salty.  They missed it on the eggs, sausage, and potatoes.  Cook seems rushed."}
{"text":"Great service and the food was excellent.  Love the little muffins they were delicious.  Will be going back and it is nice they have outside setting so you can bring your dog.  Just need a better sign saying that you need to sign in for the waiting list."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing little place. Food was wonderful. Mini muffins were delectable. Bacon was an it undercooked as I like it crispy but everyone's different. Biscuits and gravy were amazing. Scrambled eggs were good. Coffee was good. Maggie my waitress was very attentive and always made sure my coffee cup was full. Will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"Adorable and delicious diner that is such a delight. The food is scrumptious and the staff is warm and it feels like home. I will definitely be back when I come through the area."}
{"text":"I am for sure coming back! Great customer service and food! I recommend ordering the French toast and the potatoes."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was okay, but the food 2as pretty good. We were seated rather quickly considering it was Easter Sunday. The cinnamon coffee was pretty good; went well with the famous muffins."}
{"text":"Charming place.  The food is good.  I had the cooks special with pancakes, eggs and bacon.  I also had their potatoes.  The potatoes could be better.  Everything else was good.  The best part is the muffins you get upon being seated and the freshly squeezed orange juice.  This place attracts a lot of older people.  We were probably one of the youngest in the room."}
{"text":"After attending an event in downtown Glendale, my friend and I had brunch here today and loved it. We loved the antique look and feel of the restaurant and did not have to wait to be seated. The waitstaff was friendly and eager to serve. The mini muffins were fantastic and our food was delivered quickly. We both had the breakfast that served 2 eggs, bacon or sausage,  pancakes and we both added the potatoes. I was pleased that they had turkey sausage to substitute for regular sausage. The feed was tasty and the price was excellent. We got out of there spending $10 each including tip. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like it here. Small place that was packed when I walked in. Got my food quick and had excellent service by Susan. I just wanted a simple breakfast and it tasted wonderful. Definitely a good spot to go to for quick food."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes you feel like you're visiting your grandparents (in a GOOD way). The old decor/antiques allows you to feel right at home! The food is amazing! I had the eggs Benedict with chorizo and it was perfect. The basket of muffins were delicious as was the pecan cinnamon roll!!!"}
{"text":"I know I seem like a crazy person who can't make up my mind on this restaurant, but I think I'm done with it. Went here a few more times in the last 6 months or so, the eggs florentine went south.... eggs not cooked correctly, hollandaise was gluey... produce not so fresh. Went last weekend, got two eggs and bacon with potatoes. The eggs were cooked well but flavorless... the whole plate was flavorless. I broke up pieces of bacon and mixed it with the potatoes and put the eggs on top.... still not good. The potatoes were undercooked, crunchy still, and had no seasoning whatsoever, it was just a bland pile of grease... yuck. On top of that, we waited over 30 minutes for a table. I don't think I'll be back, there are too many good breakfast places around to continue to go to a bad one.


PS The service here continues to be very friendly, so that is a plus."}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook knows how to do breakfast!  Everything was so FRESH and TASTY.  Mini muffins were warm and tasty.  FRESH squeezed OJ was AMAZING!!  Our Omelets were-out-of-this-world and the CINNAMON ROLL was the bee's knees.  If you are searching for OUTSTAND breakfast, KISS the COOK is your spot!!"}
{"text":"This is the Best breakfast/Brunch restaurant. My first visited here was wonderful so I decided to return the next day and I was greeted with the same waitress Ms. Nancy. She suggested the egg nog French toast which was AMAZING! she was very attentive, and so kind! This is my new spot! I highly recommended this place. When you go there ask for Ms.Nancy, she will take good care of you. :)"}
{"text":"My cousin took me to this place, and it's dead on. Cute little place with good food, good service and a pleasant atmosphere. They serve out a little basket of toasty warm muffins before you even eat.

The portion size is perfect unless you order a delicious pecan cinnamon roll.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I were going out for breakfast but we realized the place we wanted to tryout was closed, so we decided to stop here.

We got seated right away.  I have driven passed this place numerous amounts of times but once you walk in, it was definitely not what I expected.  This place was quite quaint.  I liked it.

Our server was really, really sweet.  My husband ordered their special French toast with orange something and cream cheese...it sounded really good.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  They brought us a muffin basket and those mini muffins were really tasty.

Our food comes out and my husband hates it.  He says it tasted like imitation orange flavoring.  Of course I had to try, to me it was really strong on the orange maybe too much zest....I don't know.  My food was real good.  I wanted my eggs over-medium...they were much more runny than I like.  The biscuits and gravy were decent, not Crackle Barrel but good.

So needless to say, I saw that face of disappointment on my husband and I knew that there was no way I would be able to enjoy the rest of my meal.  So I hurried and ate what I could, paid and drove his butt to McD."}
{"text":"My Stepmom and I chose this place because of its name and the yelp reviews. The food was really good. The Cinnamon coffee is a must! So is the Pecan Carmel roll. My stepmom and I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant. I gave it 4 stars because service was iffy in a nearly empty restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here a couple days ago for breakfast. First of all there decode and mugs are adoreable. Usually I would go with the biscuits and gravy but for some reason my tummy settled on the Belgian waffle w mixed berries , and boy am I glad I did it was dekicious and very affordable. My boyfriend ended up going with the biscuits and gravy (the reason were together) lol but I did not like them I'm not quite sure how to explain the taste but it was not good. There coffee was French vanilla and delicious!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I'm trying to think why I wouldn't give this place 5 stars. Today was my first time visiting this restaurant which is conveniently located less than a mile from my new beau's home. So we'll start with four stars until I have at least 5 visits under my culinary belt.

In the 9 and 3/4 years that I have resided in Arizona, for the first time, I have found a breakfast place I can call \"home\".

Let me start with the bacon. 

When I ponder going vegetarian, I am only halted from executing said diet merely because there is no way on Mother Nature's Great Green Earth that I could/should/would ever give up my beloved pork strip. All bacon is not created equal but KTC has found one of the blessed thick cut smoked bacon brands that surpass most. (Costco has a great maple bacon from Canada if you trust my bacon expertise) I and my table mates were pleased.

We all ordered the day's special: Thick-cut bacon, eggs & potato cakes($7.45). Yummers! My love ordered an additional order of french toast ($4.50) with blueberries ($1.50) which he generously shared with I and his brother.

The baby-sized muffins were a nice, tasty, fresh-tasting start and didn't ruin my appetite for the main meal.

There were fresh flowers on the tables which I think is a great homey touch. The food presentation was visually pleasing. The orange juice ($2.25, large) was fresh and pulpy just like I like it. If it wasn't fresh squeezed it certainly tasted that way.

I didn't order coffee cause it was \"see-through\" and I like it dark & strong.

I agree with one of the other posters that the food is hella fresh tasting and this is what separates it from any of the pathetic chain restaurants its been compared to. (Incidentally, if Denny's is a place you frequent, that shit should have tasted like manna from the Heavens for you).

Did you ever have bacon & eggs that tasted like old recycled lard? Ick. That's what's missing here and that's what makes Kiss The Cook special.

The service was awesome. The staff are friendly and humorous.

The decor is country cute and mismatched as one poster pointed out which lends to its grandmotherly charm.

You get a \"kiss\" with your bill.

Actually, I just realized, that I would give this place 5 stars if it used Organic ingredients sourced mostly from Local Farms. That can be hard when the meals you offer do not have ingredients that are available locally.

If your palate longs for breakfast food made with \"Love\" and flavor, support Local Arizona small business and try Kiss the Cook!"}
{"text":"I was so glad to find this hidden gem! The food is really good, and the service is some of the best i've seen."}
{"text":"I love the funky and very eclectic decor. If your bored with conversation you can always look at all the different things on the walls. I had a basic breakfast which was really good. No trouble with runny eggs or over cooked. The dinner ware did not match which is all a part of this eclectic atmosphere. The place was packed and the only negative thing I can say; they were short on staff and we waited a very long time for water/coffee and worse for her to come back to take our order."}
{"text":"We stopped by around noon for a quick brunch and had a great experience. Our server, Missy, was fantastic and ever-attentive, always keeping our coffee full. I ordered the huevos rancheros which came with a basket of delicious muffins and home style potatoes. I thought the serving size was perfect; definitely enough to keep me sustained for awhile!

There were only two things that I was disappointed with: 1)my huevos rancheros were a bit bland and did not have much heat and 2) there was no free Wi-Fi as indicated on Yelp."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious!! My husband ordered one of their cinnamon rolls which was absolutely fantastic. I ordered the French toast which was amazing as well. Their coffee was great, too. They served us a small basket of mini muffins to start which were hot and fresh out of the oven. Such a great atmosphere and the service was great although a little slow. Would definitely recommend otherwise!"}
{"text":"Like Cracker Barrel except slower service and slower food prep time, and a paucity of seating.  The building is extremely long and narrow from the outside view, thereby leading to expectations of a roomy interior but then you get inside and feel tricked.  There's a small counter and cluttered waitstaff area that takes up a good chunk of the non-cooking area inside, and then what looks like a living room sized seating area is all that's left.  On a Monday morning I was barely able to get a table.  I can't imagine the weekends.

Food was above average, prices were fair, but I thought the portions were too small.  For $5 it's a very small stack of 3 pancakes, and you're not eating into the profit margin much by having them actually fit the entire surface of the plate.  My order was more like the side order that you get for free with an omelette purchase at IHOP, except that the pancakes were spread out on the plate instead of stacked up straight.

And the place does have that Cracker Barrel cute country feel to it, but the old part of Glendale isn't convenient for most of us, especially this portion that is immersed by used car dealers, pawn shops, and homeless pedestrians."}
{"text":"Good ole fashioned homestyle cooking, friendly staff, good prices, try the muffins, you'll love em!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  The owner straight lied to us and blamed her waitress for something that was up to her. She actually tried to break down market prices of pork chops to us...wth??? 
The special of the day, which was on display on the front chalkboard sign, was a two pork chop breakfast for $11.95. I ordered that and was informed they only had one pork chop left. I told them I would take the one and our party  (6) all ordered.  Our food was blah, as was the coffee. When our check arrived I was charged for a different breakfast ($10.95)plus a side meat of 1 pork chop ($7)!! When we pointed out how this didn't make sense the owner told us since we didn't get the 2 pork chops we were charged market price for 1. We pointed out the sign and were told it didn't apply even though it fell on them. She had the nerve to remove 40 cents from the bill. This was the most insulting dining experience of my life."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was horrible. It was a busy day but it should take asking 3 times to get straws and silverware. Also had to get are reheated."}
{"text":"This is a place we frequent farely often. They serve homestyle meals like your mama makes. The restaurant is set up cottage style - best description. The staff are always friendly and helpful. They have small warm homemade muffins. Very good with homemade apple butter. Today was new dish for me. New Orleans style Omlette with spicy hollandaise sauce. Very flavorful.
They have items around the place for sale. Mainly antiques, but also some nice mugs."}
{"text":"this is a good breakfast place. i especially love their cajun style benedict. big servings and good food. you might want to arrive early during breakfast hours as the place can get quite busy. servers are friendly. the only thing is that space is quite tight."}
{"text":"My husband and I always drove by this place and always wanted to try it well today we did and we will be back again! Welcoming staff with amazing service!  The mini muffins are great the waffle and eggs were perfect it was all around great! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Kiss the Cook is ok place to eat. Nothing fancy but the atmosphere is cozy. This restaurants plates, glasses, chairs, etc don't match each other and this gives it a homey feel. There is usually a waiting line to get a seat mainly because the restaurant isn't too big. The food is ok just not my type of breakfast food."}
{"text":"Every meal comes with a kiss, we were informed shortly after sitting down. I was going to ask if we had to cook our own food or how that whole thing worked out, but didn't.

KTC was a solid 3 stars for our breakfast this morning. I ordered the Canjun Bene; Paul, the Belgian waffle; and Jason, the biscuits and gravy. Three orders of mini muffins arrived shortly thereafter, with real butter and apple butter that was at the table. As others have stated, the muffins were great. Our meals arrived in a timely manner and we all dug in. Paul polished off his waffle promptly while Jason and I slowly enjoyed our meals. I honestly have to say I wish I didn't eat so many muffins because I wasn't able to finish my eggs, which were wonderful. The creole seasoning added to the Hollandaise sauce added a terrific flavor and just a little heat.

The decor made me feel like I was back home in Northwest Ohio. That doesn't add the the appeal for me, but some enjoy those things.

While service during our meal was attentive (I drink a lot of water during a meal and their glasses were pretty small, but I was refilled several times). However, after our plates were cleared, we sat around for almost ten minutes before we could flag down our server for the bill. Which was when we also received our kisses. Hershey's Kisses. Cute, but I rarely eat candy. Still, cute."}
{"text":"Met a friend for breakfast, early on a glorious summer day. Arrived about 8ish with only 2 tables occupied, but when we left about an hour later the place was hopping with a older, much older crowd.

Seated right away, greeted and asked if we wanted coffee. I would have had a iced flavored but they were out that morning, so ice tea it was. The tea was perfect. Drinks arrived minutes later along with a basket of mini muffins. 

Both ordered the 2 egg combo, mine over easy, hers scrambled with bacon.

It took about 10 minutes for our food to arrive. Picture perfect except for the puddle of \"butter\" on the top of my eggs. Bacon and Grandma potatoes both a mix of crispy and soft.  Drinks refilled.

The place has a homey vibe with everyone, even fellow customers happy and sociable.

Was my breakfast perfect, no, was it good...yes, above average. Prices competitive with chain breakfast joints.

I will return and next time try the eggs Benedict, the lady at the table next to me had it and it looked amazing.

Parking easy too. A enjoyable morning."}
{"text":"We weren't in the mood to go to some boring chain and we weren't having a whole lot of luck searching for breakfast places because we had already been to most of them.  After getting a little deeper in the search, the husband suggested this place.  

I was immediately surprised when we walked in by the sheer amount of tables and chairs they managed to pack into this tiny little restaurant.  This is definitely not a place to come and eat if you have personal space issues.  While it was extremely busy inside we were immediately seated at a tiny table for two and greeted by a sweet lady named Sue.

I ordered the Country Breakfast with Bacon so I could try a little of everything that this place had to offer.  My meal came with 2 eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, fried potatoes, and the awesome little muffin basket everyone has talked about.  The little muffin basket served pre-meal like bread at an Italian restaurant is why I give this place 4 stars instead of just 3.  Everything else was average but good.

The prices were fair, the amount of food was plentiful, and the service was quick and friendly.  I could definitely see myself coming back here if I am in this part of town."}
{"text":"Amazing words don't describe the food! First time here and it didn't disappoint. The restaurant is quaint and unique. None of the settings match, which adds to the appeal. Although the service wasn't the best, the restaurant was extremely busy and I think that has a lot to do with the quality of service we received. I recommend checking it out, it's well worth it."}
