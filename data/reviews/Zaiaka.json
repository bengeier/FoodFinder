{"text":"\"Zaiaka\" means \"flavor\", and they downright deliver on the name. There are several good (and not-so-good) Indian restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, but here's what distinguishes Zaiaka as a leader. The food is always prepared with the very freshest, high-quality ingredients (paneer is made in house, etc.), served steaming hot and correctly spiced (never overdone) in good-sized portions. The complimentary papadams served with chutney before the meal are always fresh and crisp. This may seem like a small point, but anyone who has ever been served chewy papadams that have been sitting around soaking up humidity all day will appreciate this. They do a wonderful job on the familiar favorites like rogan josh (lamb always very tender), chana masala, chili chicken, and palak paneer, but their menu is more interesting than the typical Indian restaurant because of their numerous specialties that go beyond the predictable standard dishes, like chicken with fresh mango, baingan bukhara, and tilapia in mustard sauce. They also do very good biryani. Biryani is not one of my personal favorites from past experiences, but I'll have theirs anytime; it's just more flavorful. As for bread, centrally important to Indian food, Zaiaka does excellent, always-fresh garlic naan, onion naan, paneer kulcha, and mouth-watering poori and kashmiri naan. Zaiaka is also distinguished by their atmosphere and their generous, honest hospitality. The decor is more upscale (with real tablecloths and cloth napkins) but not the least bit pretentious. The owners, the Kumars, are among the nicest people you could hope to meet. They make absolutely certain you truly feel comfortable and welcome. I wholeheartedly concur with the other reviewers who noted feeling as if they were guests in the Kumar home. All this adds up to a superior dining experience. Not only is Zaiaka my favorite local Indian restaurant, it ranks among the best I have tried anywhere during my business travels. I have held large dinners for my employees and my family there, as well as had them cater events, always with great success. Virtually everyone I've taken has raved about it, from knowledgeable Indian food enthusiasts to many \"converts\" who were initially apprehensive or, based on prior experiences, believed they didn't like Indian food. Zaiaka is an absolute find - be excellent to yourself and go there."}
{"text":"I heard about Zaiaka thru an ad. It is about 30 minutes out from Pittsburgh, so I would normally not travel so far to try an Indian buffet. However, it got good reviews by others, and is near the Sri Venkateswara Temple and Hindu Jain Temple. I figured that they catered to those audiences, and if they are still around, they are probably good.  I was not disappointed. While the buffet is not one of the megabuffets, all of the food was extremely tasty. By my recollection, the main dishes included chili chicken, tandoori chicken, fried cabbage shreds, string beans with coconut, lentils (dahl), matar paneer (peas/cheese), lamb vindalu, tika masala chicken, curry chicken, malai kofta (vegetable balls) and an eggplant dish in sauce (don't recall the specific name). They had pakoras for appetizers and gulab jamun and some fruit (cut mellon, grapes) for desert. There wasn't really salad, but a collection of condiments including small pieces of lettuce, sliced tomatoes and cut up onions, as well as pickles, hot green chilies and some sauces. Plain naan was brought to  the table and rice was on the main buffet.  Having gone only once, I don't know how consistent the buffet choices are, so you might see something different.  Everything here was well marked (except for the sauces -- I heard fellow diners talking \"I think that's mango chutney but I'm not sure.\") More than that, the hostess answered peoples' questions, in detail, about what was in the dishes. I guess this is driven in part because they are proud of what they made, and in part because they have a very diverse clientele that seemed to include a lot of Indians (another good sign for an Indian buffet). From my experience with many from that region, different sects have different customs with regard to what they will or won't eat, so clear explanations of what was in each dish would be appreciated. I certainly appreciated it as well since I like to know what I am eating.  To give some examples of why I think this buffet was so good. None of the food was greasy -- not even the pakoras. All of food was fresh -- none was old, stale or dried out. All of the food was well seasoned. It all tasted good. All of it was an appropriately edible temperature. All of the meats I tried had their bones removed. The pickles were very flavorful -- not oily or salty. The gulab jamun was fluffy and mild -- not syrupy sweet, not a dense golf-ball ball of milk powder.  You could not want anything more for service. Quickly seated, plates rapidly removed, drinks always kept full. All questions answered.  My only surprises were the Lamb Vindalu and Chili Chicken. I had never seen a vindalu on a buffet, though I have eaten it before. Typically, vindalu is scorchingly hot (and usually has potatoes in it -- this had only lamb). I had seen chili chicken on several buffets (not as universal as matar paneer) and it is usually spicy. Both dishes here were not spicy at all -- still well seasoned and flavorful, but no heat at all. Most of the time, pickles are usually spicy  too, but not here. I commented on my observations and got a strange answer: we wanted to make sure that everyone had something they could eat. Well, yes, but I was not suggesting  that everything be spicy. There are meat dishes on the buffet and a large number of diners who were vegetarian and could not eat meat. I was also pointed to the green chilies, which were in fact very hot. However, one could not really slice them up and incorporate them into a dish (I tried!). I was also told that diners could ask for regular (traditionally seasoned) vidalu sauce on the side to add to their dish. I might have done that if I had known. Now you do! I also noticed that other buffets do offer some kind of hot pepper or chili sauce as a condiment that one can add to a dish. You can mix that in, unlike a cut up chili. I recommend the restaurant make that small addition if they are opposed to making even a single dish spicy.  $9 + tax + tip -- great value for money."}
{"text":"Somehow I didn't expect to come from DC and find a great Indian restaurant in Plum, PA, but I did. The papadum was warm and fresh and light. The poori was perfectly puffed and not greasy as it can sometimes be. The palak paneer was excellent with lots of cheese cubes in it. My friends got shrimp biryani and shrimp tandoori. While the biryani was good, the tandoori shrimp was a big hit. The others thought the variety of breads in the bread basket were good, but with my lovely poori I wasn't inclined to try the other. Finished with ras malai and it too was good. One thing: if the owner sees that you're new there (and Anglo I guess :-) he might ask about the level of spiciness you prefer. If you're comfortable at all with Indian food, or almost anything other than american, I suggest you go with \"medium\" rather than \"mild\". I would have given 5 stars except that they seemed a little understaffed for the number of tables that needed to be served, and the service was a tad slow. On the other hand it also seemed like a friendly, local, authentic, family business and maybe we should learn to relax a bit. Highly recommend Zaiaka and can't wait to go back. Oh, that poori..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here when I found Sammy's in Monroeville was closed on Monday. It was OK. Food not super fresh or hot, which you can expect for a buffet. Some of the vegetable entrees were tasty, but the chicken offerings pretty much all tasted the same and without a lot of spice. Much too bland for me. OK, overall, but nothing special."}
{"text":"This is one of our all-time favorite restaurants.  The food is WONDERFUL and the owner is so sweet.  She remembers us from visit to visit and always stops by our table to check how we have been and that we are enjoying our visit.  Even if you do not like spicy food, this is a \"must go\".  You can choose the level of \"heat\".  My favorite is Goa Shrimp Curry and my husband's is Lamb Korma, although neither of us have ever gotten a dish we didn't like, and we've tried several.  We have gone for the buffet which is wonderful, but we prefer to order our favorites off the menu.  There is a large variety of Naan, so there something for everyone.  They do not serve wine, but they have a BYOB policy with no corking fee.  And, there is a state store across the street. :)  Even if you do not order desert, they often bring a small one complementary. The room has a clean feeling about it.  I'm often amazed at dingy atmospheres at many local restaurants.  It is a restaurant where you feel comfortable wearing jeans and a nice shirt or dressing up a bit.  Not somewhere I would go in sweats.  LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Great food, helpful and friendly owners. Best Indian food in the Pittsburgh area"}
{"text":"Great grilled combination of chicken, shrimp, and lamb ordered the Zaiaka. We will definitely return. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at an Indian restaurant. I tried everything and it was all delicious! Buffets are the best so you can figure out what you like and don't like but I have to say it was all delicious! Definitely will go back again. I love the spices! And the spicy."}
{"text":"I can't believe they charged $5 for my 22 months boy.  The pineapple was bad and dry and they still put it out. The fried fish was out and we asked for more, they said its coming out for 10 mins but never did. It was just horrible."}
{"text":"One of the things I miss from Britain is a really good curry, and Zaiaka helps fill the gap. The food isn't great, but it's definitely the best curry I've had in Pittsburgh. The service is brisk and friendly, the prices are reasonable and it's BYOB so I'm happy to give it four stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite carnivorous Indian restaurant East of the city. Don't miss out on their garlic nan. If you're a fan of lamb, they make some very tasty curries.  Careful though. If you ask for anything spicier than a 5/10, the chefs can really put a hurting on you."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian buffet that I've tried in Pittsburgh. The vegetarian dishes are very flavorful, though some could be spicier. As someone else said, the chana masala is excellent, as is the kheer.  The customer service is very good. My water glass is rarely empty! They also treat you like you've been a customer for years, even if it's your first time in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The best Indian food place from here to SF.  I highly recommend the Lamb Curry.  Love this place. The owners are so nice and the service is great."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh!  The owners really are the sweetest people and very accommodating and welcoming to us every time we visit here. The decor is pretty with white table cloths and soft Indian music playing in the background. Much more relaxing and peaceful atmosphere than India Garden.  We have tried a variety of dishes at Zaiaka and they are all very tasty with wonderful flavors and aromas. We bring our three children with us and they always get lots of attention and are very much welcomed.  The lunch buffet is also delicious and affordable with plenty of tasty options with fresh naan served to the table."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. Food is always good. Only thing is I wish they played louder music..."}
{"text":"A JEWEL IN THE EAST YOU NEED TO VISIT FOR GOOD INDIAN!  This is a lovely little place on the Golden Mile Highway! The owners are sweet as pie and offer really delish dishes! The real steal is the lunch buffet! It's supper inexpensive and tasty and better and cheaper than India Gardens!  Menu fav: Kodi Kofta"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian place.  The lady who owns it is very nice and really proud of her restaurant. She will help you with the menu and even order for you if you like, she truly wants you to enjoy your experience there.   I feel this is also the cleanest Indian restaurant i've been to in the area and it is also one of the few buffets that i will go to.  Its appetizing to the eyes as well as the stomach.  It is less than $9 including the tax and is worth every penny.  If your ordering off the menu the Seekh Kabab (lamb kabab) is great way to start your meal.   Sometimes i'll swing by and just get that to go, its an appetizer big enough to eat as a meal (it is spicy but not annoying spicy).  It comes out on a sizzling platter.  The Mugultawny Soup with chicken is intensely flavored and spicy,  i highly recommend this soup, it will warm your soul.  If you like Indian food make a trip out to murrysville and give it a whirl."}
{"text":"Not sure how to rate this one so I'm erring on the plus side. It was delicious! The Sunday buffet was fabulous. So what's my \"reservation\"? I sometimes get an upset stomach at Indian restaurants. Don't know why. I've heard others have similar issues. But if you generally enjoy Indian food, please take this as a solid 4 star review."}
{"text":"Awful food even bad service.   DONT LEAVE A TIP - THE OWNER POCKETS IT WITHOUT SHARING IT WITH THE SERVERS.   Went for the buffet after reading about it on Yelp. When we arrived they sat us down on a table that had only two place settings. Never gave us cutlery for the other two in our party. We had to ask for it like 4 times.   The buffet was not good. All the dishes tasted the same. There were limited quantities in the buffet. After the dishes ran out they took forever to replenish. We pretty much finished without a second helping after waiting for 30 mins.   The owner was super rude to another table and was on his cell phone all the time while walking around.   Never returning..."}
{"text":"My second time visiting here; stopped in for lunch on Saturday and luckily they had the buffet going this time!  I'm not accustomed to indian food in this area, but compared to NJ I found Zaiaka very favorable.  Good jeera rice, served with some of my favorites like Aloo Tikki, Chana Masala and heavenly fresh Naan brought to our table.  A few heavy dishes thrown in there like Spicy Chicken Curry and Chicken Makhani, but apart from that the rest balanced them very well....  Quite a fan of the mixed vegetable dishes they had out.  Strangely though, there weren't any Lamb or Paneer dishes, compared to 4 or more chicken dishes I recall.  I left satisfied regardless.  Very nice staff."}
{"text":"I first ventured to Zaiaka the first week it opened in 2007 and was hooked - and we go back about once/month on the weekends for the buffet.  I am a firm fan of Indian buffets - I like to try a nip of this and a tad of that since I am still learning what I like and what I don't.  I do prefer Northern over Southern Indian, and consider Zaiaka the best Northern Indian restaurant in the area!  It certainly is not as large a buffet as you might find elsewhere, but the quality of the food makes it well worth the trip - it is only about 20 min out of downtown in non-rush hour so it is not that far.  It is always fresh and hot, they refill in small amounts to keep it fresh and appealing.  They always have assorted pakoras and sometimes somosas - always fresh, never greasy.  Chili chicken is always tasty along side the tandoori chicken (can't really rate that as I am not a big tandoori chicken fan).  Then a rice.  Then - the fun begins.  There is usually always a paneer dish- saag, bhurji, or matter. Always a dal.  Aloo gobi.  Usually the cabbage with peas and coconut (I swear I could make an entire meal out of it and some paneer), often the eggplant dish.  All in all, maybe 8 vegetable dishes.  Then generally  three meat dishes - usually 2 chicken (tikka masala, curry, korma); the other could be goat or lamb.  They bring fresh naan to the table.  Desserts are generally just the usual - kheer, gulab jamun, some fresh fruit.  Although one day we were there and they were out of kheer; but they were kind enough to bring out a bowl of gajar halwa they had leftover from a wedding. omg. i could eat that non-stop - i had never had it before and never had it as good anywhere else.  As much as the food is good, we always are greeted by the owners, Meena and Dev.  I think that is part of the appeal - they are so warm and friendly and you always feel like a member of the family.  On holidays, they always add a few special things to the buffet.  And, if you are fortunate enough to be there on a day when there is a party, the buffet may have some of the party's favorite items - a way to experience new and different items.  If you like Northern - or you are just learning to eat Indian - put this at the top of your list."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a bit out of the way, and the hours are eccentric, but this is well worth the trip. The vegetarian appetizer platter is pretty good, but my  chicken korma was excellent. The chicken was so tender I could cut it with my fork. I also found the garlic naan thinner than I am used to, which I think adds to my positive review. My wife had lamb korma (just the right level of spicy) and the kashimir naan which she really enjoyed. All in all a good experience, and we are looking forward to going back again."}
{"text":"I ordered 4 veggie biryani's, 2 chicken biryani and 2 lamb biryani TOGO. The Veggie biryani was delicious. My friends who ate the non-veg biryani's told that the food was good. So I do recommend this restaurant for nice trials and take outs. They were pretty fast and receptive."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday for dinner. We had 4 adults /2 children. Waiter/ owners were very friendly and accommodating. We ordered different dishes and shared everything. Not 1 bad meal, everything was excellent.  Everything was fresh, not too spicy, and very clean.  It's a half hour drive for us, very worth it. Can't wait to hit the buffet next time.  2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly service, and some of the better Indian food I've had in the Pittsburgh area. Excellent garlic naan!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and the best Indian I've had since the UK.  Their prices are good, too."}
{"text":"excellent food. i have been a die hard india garden fan for years and this place is just as good and a thousand times cleaner. i have had takeout lots of times but this was my first (and last) time eating in. the reason this place is empty on a saturday night is definitely the poor service. the server did not seem able to answer even basic questions regarding the menu. the appetizer came to the table after we had our food and a drink refill was out of the question. this is because once we got our food we never saw her again. seriously. after waiting 20 minutes after we had finished our meals we finally flagged down another woman who was kind enough to bring the check & cash us out."}
{"text":"Easily the best (north) Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The decor is simple and tasteful. The service is outstanding - very friendly and courteous. Everyone is just very nice to the patrons. I've come here for dinner and for a private party and was very satisfied both times. For the private party, they even cordoned off an area for the kids to have their own space, a really nice touch I thought.  The food is simply excellent. I love chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori and couldn't get enough of their fare. The mutter paneer was excellent as was the biriyani, kababs and appetizers. Overall, I think Zaiaka does a great job of having strong but not overwhelming flavors in their foods. Everything just seems to work well together. Highly recommended if you can get out to Plum!"}
{"text":"Zaiaka scores quite high in offering tremendously tasty Indian fare in a strip mall all the up the Golden Mall Highway. Zaiaka is a godsend to those forlorn souls who live in a culinary vacuum. Zaiaka is run by friendly people who will go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant experience, when was the last time you said that about Red Lobster?"}
{"text":"Went here the other night with friends with Groupons. The food was really good, better than many other Indian restaurants. Friendly service, although very slow (in all fairness, it was the last day for the Groupon and they got slammed). Best to go here to savor the food, talk with friends, and not be in a hurry. Bread basket is a nice feature: contains a mixture of different kinds of nan.  Will go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant that I've tried in the Pittsburgh area.  The food is good, service friendly and efficient and prices affordable (especially with the Entertainment Book coupon).  I visited for the first time after purchasing a Groupon.  Everything was fresh and they were very good about making modifications to orders.  The chicken was very tender and moist and the sauce had a lot of flavor and quite a kick (but not so much that it burned out my taste buds).  I think my favorite visit to Zaiaka was when my parents were with me the week I moved to Plum.  The owner/manager recognized me from coming in with my fiance and asked where he was.  I said he was at work and introduced my parents.  Knowing I was new to town, they started to tell me the best places for groceries, gas, etc.  They also said if I ever needed anything to stop in and ask.  I have no doubt that if I did take them up on their request, they'd be happy to help.  That is certainly something you don't see every day.  Back to the food.  We had the buffet and found it to have a nice mix of \"typical\" Indian fare and a few more \"exotic\" items to please any palate.    I've been back on numerous occasions and always had an excellent experience.  I love that there is a great Indian option so close to home."}
{"text":"Zaiaka is my favorite North Indian restaurant in Pittsburgh. No one makes channa masala like them. It tastes just like Indian home cooking, the sort you would get at a friend's family dinner. The owner is a wonderful, welcoming woman whom I've gotten to know over the past few years. The cooks have always been obliging to my requests for less oil to be used in my curry. I have also been given free dessert after dinner just because, which was very much appreciated. There is a good lunch buffet, which is a great way to try a variety of the dishes there. It's fresh, and the cooks purposely don't cook food for it that dries out easily, such as biryani. It far surpasses India Garden in every aspect but price, but it shows in the quality.  The decor is classy and nicely decorated, with white tablecloths and BYOB service. The location leaves a lot to be desired-- a storefront in a bland strip mall in Plum, but it's well worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  The owners, Meena and Dev, are extremely friendly and helpful, and they treat their customers well, especially if you come back a few times.  You can be sure you will be remembered.  The wait staff is attentive... No matter how spicy your Vindaloo, you can be sure that your water glass will always be full.  And that is to speak nothing of the food.  I'm devouring a chicken biryani as I type, and I can't think of a better way to follow up a long day at work.  The food here is the best Indian food I have had, and it's not for lack of trying other places.  Order yourself a lamb seekh kabab as an appetizer, and from the minute it comes out of the kitchen to the second you swallow the last lonely onion off of the skillet, you will be experiencing pure bliss.  Recommended main courses are the Lamb Korma, and any of the DoPiaza dishes.  However, it is really hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.  On the down side of things, sometimes it does take a long time to get the check.  They are very concerned with being good hosts, but sometimes they keep you a little long.  You can always get out on time by just going up to the counter and asking to pay.  That is the only bad thing I can think of, though.    I go here more than once a week and it is because of how much I love the food and the service.  Try it out."}
{"text":"Very good. I'd rate this up there close to Tamarind (Craig St), Taste of India (Penn Ave near Children's Hospital), and Kohinoor (Monroeville) in food quality. I found the service sluggish (slow to bring the bill when I was done). But I've only been once."}
{"text":"What an incredible place!  I've been a regular patron of Zaiaka for about two years now, and I cannot stop going back, and bringing all of my friends with me.  The previous two reviewers were correct in their assessment of the owner.  Meena Kumar is a very sweet woman who will do everything in her power to ensure you enjoy your experience at her location.  The food is, of course, incredible.  The seekh kebab (lamb) is, as DK said, a great appetizer to open your meal with, although it's best if shared with one or two other people, as it can be very filling.  The vegetarian dishes are also very good and worth trying out; my favorites are the malai kofta, mattar paneer, and dal makhani.  If you're trying Indian food for the first time, I'd recommend trying either Chicken Tikka Masala or Chicken Makhan Wala.  Either is very good, but be sure to get some kind of naan to go with it.  The atmosphere is very relaxed; you do not have to dress up in order to go, as the place is very casual.  Alcohol is BYOB, but on some occasions (most notably Valentine's day), wine is complementary.  Zaiaka also caters, so if you have a party or wedding, it may be worth your interest to see what they can do.  Once again, this place is a gem!  Every time I bring my friends, they also end up loving Zaiaka, and some even visit on a regular basis with people they also know.  Be sure to visit Zaiaka sometime; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the worst briyanis that I have had in years..we also ordered a chicken curry which had a raw spice taste..wudnt go back..  The staff were considerate though..they stayed open after 9 30pm for us..but the food was a let down..maybe v were there at the closing hrs..n hence some bad left over food I guess.."}
{"text":"We moved to Plum about 9 months ago and needed a new Indian place. Thankfully this one is only a half a mile away. The Lamb Vindaloo and Malai Kofta have been my favorite so far! You get about 3 portions per curry entree. We found that we ended up running out of rice in order for 4 of us to finish 4 curries, but not really a big deal looking at the bigger picture. Love this place can't wait to order again!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here around 5:30 on a Sunday night. The weather was cold and snowy but the roads were OK. The atmosphere was quiet, the server was cheerful and the food was excellent. My wife had a 'mango lasi' which was very good, it had a great mango flavor and was not overly sweet - much better than one she recently had at a place on Monroeville (although I thought it could have used a little cardamon). I had a 'masala chai' but it was only OK because it was not warm enough for my tastes - tea should be served hot. They then brought us this very thin, crispy wafer things along with two awesome dips - not sure what it's called but it was very yummy! We also both ordered and enjoyed the 'mulligatawny soup'. For the main course we both had lamb dishes. I do not recall the name of my wife's meal but she loved it. I had the 'Rogan Josh' and would highly recommend it to anyone. The lamb was succulent! Talk about melt in your mouth! The Garlic Naan bread was very good as well. For those who want to know, this place is BYOB - \"Bring Your Own Bottle\". Being new to Pennsylvania I am really not used to this sort of thing and find it very annoying! The lack of wine and the not warm enough tea are my only complaints. Overall we were very pleased with all of the flavors. We left satisfied and even brought home leftovers. We definitely plan to come back soon to try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Love this place because the food tastes fresh. I had been for their buffet and i must say, their biryani and chicken curry is by far the best in Pittsburgh. Zaika definitely holds a place in my \"Top 5 Must go restaurants\" for Indian food."}
{"text":"Having lived in NYC and  London for a number of years - you become used to \"curry houses\" having a certain taste and this place is the closest I have found to what I remember from those places.  Portions are good sized and the food is always great.  The food is so good here we get 2 of each meal so that we have leftovers and a mountain of naans.  Service here is awesome and the owner and his wife always make us feel at home.    This is my \"go to\" indian place.  In 4 years - have never been disappointed in eating there or getting takeout."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with Indian food, and it was absolutely excellent.  The lady working here was one of the sweetest ladies ever.  She helped my mother and I order everything, and gave us plenty of \"complimentary\" things.  We came in here blind not knowing anything about what was good Indian food or what we should try, but by the time we left, we were opened up to a whole new world of great food.  All of the plates were fantastic and I will tell you a million times that the sauce was delicious.  Baingan Bharta: Eggplant cubes cooked with herbs and spices.  This was excellent.  My mom fell in love with this dish.  Once again, I do not even know what was in this sauce, but we completely wiped it clean.  Chicken Saag:  Chicken cooked with Spinach in herbs and spices.  Wow, this was my favorite.  I could've just eaten the spinach.  If you love greens, you would love this plate.  Shrimp Tandoori:  Jumbo shrimp cooked with onions, peppers, and, you guessed it, \"herbs and spices.\"  I do not know what these \"herbs and spices\" are, but they made every plate absolutely fantastic.  The plate came out sizzling hot, and I think it may have been still sizzling by the time I finished.  Garlic \"Bread\" was also delicious and was used to wipe up all the remaining sauces in the bowls.    (COMPLIMENTARY)**-  A Zaiaka Pen and two bowls of rice pudding.  YummmmiiEE.  Like I said, the lady here was one of the sweetest I have even encountered.  She was so happy that we came to eat at her restaurant, and she was also very helpful when it came to ordering.  Come here.  Even if you think you do not like Indian food, you do.  It is delicious, spicy, and tasty.  Not to mention, who doesn't want a complimentary Zaiaka Pen?!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love love this place. Although it's in an obscure shopping mall location, the food is outrageously delicious. The owners are so sweet. They are always willing to help you decipher what you would like if you aren't exactly familiar with the cuisine. This is the best indian food I have had in Pittsburgh. They are reasonably priced around 12-14 per entree, and it is so well worth it. Also, they do groupons pretty frequently. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"After moving to the Pittsburgh area and missing our regular indian restaurant, we wanted to find an indian restaurant the same standard. When we went to Zaiaka, we found that great food that we loved, only a little bit more spicy."}
{"text":"Great food for both lunch and dinner! The buffet they have for lunch has something for everyone, while the dinner menu has some great choices. The staff and owners are super friendly, which is a bonus! The food tastes great...try the mango shake...beautiful color and tastes delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was good... but we had horrible service the day we came. It could have been just an off day but it was pretty bad. After we were seated, a party of 15-20 people were seated behind us. They basically forgot all about us and we had to ask for the check at least 3 times. Then they gave us our check, took it, came back, looked at our table, went back to the register and crossed out certain things and made our bill higher... and that was AFTER we gave him the credit card to pay. So in total it took us an hour to pay after we finished our meal. The food was decent but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Zaiaka really just isn't all that good. First of all, it's in the middle of nowhere. So, I guess if you live around there then it's fine if you're looking for something less than exceptional; however, I definitely would not recommend driving out of your way for it (as I did).   As far as food -- I thought the vegetable pakora was good, but everything else I found to be underwhelming (and one appetizer definitely cannot make up for $40 worth of food). The vindaloo wasn't all that spicy (despite my requesting it be very hot) and forget about getting any extra heat on the side.   It was also a little strange because there weren't any other patrons inside -- so I was left whispering as though I were in a library.   I mean sure, people seem to love this place a whole lot, so maybe you will, too, but I was definitely left wishing I had just went on a date somewhere else."}
{"text":"I was totally in the mood for indian food and didn't want to default to the always satisfactory never extroardinary india garden.  My office is in M'ville, so instead of going 3 minutes up the road we decided to venture about 15 minutes out of the way to this little gem.  I agree with the other yelper about the owner.  I love it when the owner takes such pride in their joint and really tries to let you know how much she appreciates the business.  Zaiaka is located in your typical non-descript strip mall of off 286 next to a subway and some other typical strip mall store.  The entrance is a little striking, because they have a nice little waiting area with a couple of chairs and your obligatory statue of Ganesh.  The restaurant itself is what you'd expect a bunch of tables some images of hindu dietes.  I'm from west indian descent, so my expectations can be a little high for indian food, especially indian food served buffet style.  However, I found this buffet to be fresh, delicious and had some more expensive items like lamb for a lunch buffet.  The lamb curry was my favorite and better than any I've tried in any indian joint in pittsburgh.  The nan was delicious and instead of being part of the buffet where it can get dried out they heat or cook it fresh and keep it at your table.  The chicken tikki masala was a bit above average and the vegatables were really good, especially the dish with cabbage and peas.  The only negative I have about the space itself is the carpet looks like it should be in a truck stop in central pa.  This is a bit surprising for a lady who obviously takes so much pride in her place.  The cost is less than $8 for the lunch buffet.  The owner is awesome and the next time I go I look forward to ordering a specialty off of the menu.  I hope more people go here, because this is a tough location for this type of food.  It's better than any indian buffet I've had in Pittsburgh and deserves your business."}
{"text":"We can't get enough of their food.  Everything is so fresh and flavorful.  Tonight we literally were cheering in between bites, we liked it so much. My wife and I have been coming here for years, it is a gem tucked away in Plum.  On of my favorite restaurants of all time and definitely my favorite Indian food.  Worthy of a special trip.    Tonight we got the Vegetable Samosa, Lamb Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Mango Lassi, and a few other items.  Everything was superb.  And the service is wonderful, the people are so friendly and make the experience so enjoyable.  If you have never been then you need to go.  If you have never had Indian food this is a great place to try it. If you have gone then bring friends. The value is good, the portions are nice, and the flavors are marvelous."}
{"text":"I recently visited this gem of a restaurant last weekend with my boyfriend.  He had insisted on us going for several months now, stating that it's the best Indian food he has had in Pittsburgh.  Since he's originally from India, I thought I had to give this place a try.  I've lived in Pittsburgh all of my life, and I can undoubtedly say this is the best Indian restaurant in the burgh.  The food and service are impeccable.  The owner Meena Aunty takes great pride in her restaurant, and food.  She's a very sweet and honest person.  She gives great recommendations, as to what dishes should be sampled that day.  I highly recommend trying the Goa Shrimp curry, simply the best!  It's served with large gulf shrimp, in a tasty curry sauce.  We also tried the mixed Tandoor grill, which was served hot.  The meat was so juicy and flavorful!   Also this restaurant is BYOB, with no corkage fee!!!   I can guarantee the drive out to Plum is worth it!  Enjoy :)!"}
