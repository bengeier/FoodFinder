{"text":"Drove by this place a hundred times. Not to appealing. Probably wouldn't have eaten there if not for the reviews I read.  The wife and I decided to give it a try.  Nothing fancy about the Inside either. Very clean.The waitress was friendly and prompt.  The bread was fresh and delicious. We ordered fried zucchini.  Some of the best we ever had.   The salads that came with the dinners were nice sized, crisp and fresh.  Pasta dishes were large.  Ordered veal parm. with spaghetti.  Wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs. So delicious.  Large portions. We were eating and saying to each other how good it tasted and we are definitely coming back. Took home half the main course because we were so full. Definitely going for the meat or cheese ravioli next visit which will be soon.  Waitress stated pasta and sauce are homemade. It was the real deal. You will not be disappointed or leave hungry. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Their grandparents used to have a popular Italian restaurant Oasis in Heidleburg for YEARS.  Their uncle Mario also had a take out place in Bethel Park and Little Oasis in Bridgeville was also same family.  Same recipe used here as all of those places, and it is excellent.  Make sure you ask specifically for \"homemade\" or else you will get regular pasta like you can buy in the store.  They make their own pasta and sauce here.  My favorite is the veal parmesan (to die for) with a side of homemade!  Nothing fancy, a few seats, mostly a take out place at this location. Also have great fish sandwiches."}
{"text":"This family has been making homemade pasta (yes, actual homemade noodles) since my grandparents days when they had a place in Heidleburg.  I am 3/4 italian and this is the only place my grandfather would eat spaghetti outside of his house.  To me, they have the BEST veal parmesan.. ever."}
{"text":"Homemade pasta and sauce are what make this a diamond in the rough. The sauce ,or as some would say the gravy is just too good. I had the ravioli today and it was great. It was hard for me to decide so I got half meat and half cheese ravioli. Who would think you could get such excellent food in a small town like Cecil. Lucky for me it's only a 10 minute drive."}
{"text":"The best Fish Sandwich in the area.  Quality homemade pasta, ravioli, and gnocchi.  Looking for a great fish sandwich during Lent give the Little Oasis in Carnegie a call and you will  make this a weekly visit!"}
{"text":"If you like home made Italian Sauce this is the place for you. Nothing fancy just great, affordable food.  Sauce just like my ex- wife's Grandmother makes!  Got divorced, lost the connection.... With Oasis I'm home again!"}
{"text":"The Oasis is Back!  

Mark from the Oasis - Heidelberg, which closed a few years ago,  has opened up a little place in Carnegie.  So if you were a fan of the Oasis, here is you chance to have the same homemade sauce and pasta's.   Not all of the pasta is homemade but there is homemade spaghetti, ravioli and, I think, the gnocchi.

In a small house with only two booths and one small table.  Ordered take out, so did a few others.  The house has a small porch, with a small sign that is easy to miss.  When you walk up to the porch, go to the double glass doors to enter.  The main door must be for an apartment upstairs; with a sign pointing to the double doors.

The food was very good.  Ordered the homemade spaghetti.  The noodles were tasty and al dente with the famous meat sauce that was very good. Dinner includes a salad or soup.  The salad is large with iceberg lettuce, red onions, some tomato, cucumber and green peppers.  Had the Italian dressing, which was OK.   The meal also came with some Cellone's Italian bread, several slices.  We also ordered the Penne Pasta with melted provolone cheese and meat sauce.   The two meals were enough for 4.  

The menu has chicken parmesan, fish, eggplant and more.

The young lady at the counter was very helpful and very friendly.  

Open M-F 11 to 7.  Sat. 12 to 7.

{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Oasis. I got the chicken parm and my wife got the baked ziti as she is a vegetarian. The portions were great and the value was very strong. It came with two large chicken fillets and a whole large side of pasta. I also got a cup of wedding soup. All of this was only $21"}
