{"text":"I ate a great Philly Wrap here! As far as the bar area, its small. They didn't have my favorite beer on tap (Blue Moon) Overall though, nice experience. :)"}
{"text":"Lots of great TV's and a decent burger, if that's all your looking for then go ahead.  I have to say I think we have better Sports Bars in the area than this one has turned out to be.

We sampled their Queso and chips and it was unacceptable gelatinous cheese and broken up tri-color chips clearly out of a bag."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty decent.  It used to be a Hooters, and then it was closed, and now its the dugout.  I came here because I wanted to check the place out, and grab a bite to eat.

Place has TV's, plenty of seating, and a decent menu.  Service was great, and everyone was fun and friendly.  I went with the burger, mainly because I got there to late for thier happy hour specials. Place is casual, good food, and you can watch sports while you eat.

If I was in the area, I would go again."}
{"text":"Stopped on a Sunday afternoon.....   The Margarita's were terrible and about a strong as lemonaide and mostly ICE.......  
The food was OK for bar food.......   
When the waitress asked if we wanted anoher drink, we told her they were terrible and the glass was STILL Full of mostly ice..... Instead of saying she would replace them, she said I will tell the bartender to make it better next time!!   A few weeks latter I ran into a manager out promoting the bar and when I told him the story, he said, oh ya we had a bad Sunday bartender and we fired her........ Never said, come try us again, I will take care of you, NOTHING.... There are other resturants and bars to spend MY money in!!"}
