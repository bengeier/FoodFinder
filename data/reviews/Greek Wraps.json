{"text":"Anything in their menu is delicious, I have tried all famous Greek restaurants, this one by far is the best."}
{"text":"Freshly baked pita bread.
Piles of gyros meat.
Delicious hummus, salad, and rice with most orders.
Around $10!

I was impressed with the service, deliciousness of the food, and how much of it I got for the price I paid. Would recommend and will visit again if I am in the Phoenix again."}
{"text":"First time here and loved it! Highly recommend the steak shwarma sandwich with the homemade pita. Atmosphere is very warm, clean restaurant with staff that is friendly and attentive. will be visiting again"}
{"text":"The food here is the bombdigiddy!

Me and my friends were looking for a place to eat and randomly decided on this one. I personally wasn't expecting much. Boy was I wrong. The prices based on the humongous portion you get are amazing (less than $10). 

I got the Gyro Platter. It came with a Gyros on a bed of rice (one can also get potatoes instead of rice), a side salad, hummus, tzatziki, and a pita. The gyros were flavorful and a little on the salty side but I found them perfect because they balanced out when eaten with the blandish rice. Salad was pretty standard. Their hummus was really good and you could tell it was homemade as opposed to the stuff you get from the store. The best part however, was their tzatziki. Omg BEST tzatziki I've ever had. Tangy and super flavorful with a strong dill flavor which is just the way I like it.

This place is very similar to a cafeteria. One will go up and order and then grab a number and take a seat and wait for them to bring it to you (if you ordered it for inside) or for them to call your number (if you ordered takeout). A lot of stuff is self serve so you don't have to pay tip which is great in my books. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Consistent experience every time we go there to eat! Its clean and the staff are awesome too."}
{"text":"I had the 10'' gyros.  It was delicious, I highly recommend this place.  If you are a Midwestern student you get a  10% discount"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my boyfriend and daughter,I ordered the gyros place and my boyfriend ordered the shawarma plate. We arrived an hour before they closed and it took 30mins for our order to come out. Mind you that they close pretty early at 8. So we only had another 30 to eat before they closed. So It was kind of a bummer that our order took so long. When we finally got our food it's pretty much a bang for your buck they give you a pretty good amount of meat and the side of your choice plus two salads and 2 warm pita breads. It was tasty and my tummy was def happy. Defiantly daughter approved for my little one. I also ordered spanakopita.(layered philo dough with a filling of spinach and ricotta cheese or feta maybe..) it was only $1 I was expecting it to be a decent size but nothing too big. What I got was literally a bite size triangle piece of spanakopita. I wish they had made them bigger because I've always wanted to try them thanks to food network and they were so tasty,just not a fan of how bite sized they are. I like the place and where it's located. I docked down a star because it took a long time for our food and the little bite size pie. Other than that I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Can get busy especially at lunch but that is because it is soo good!"}
{"text":"It is ok. But it take's for ever to get my chicken kabob, like 20 min. And it stinks when you get in the restaurant. It was better last year."}
{"text":"Excellent gyro. Place was packed at lunch. I had a regular gyro and a side of tzatziki sauce. Clean with an open kitchen. Will be going back."}
{"text":"After the chaos of the mall area and traffic this little gem of a spot was a real treat ! I has the gyro wrap (it's huge) and a homemade piece of baclava for under $10, spouse had the gyro salad-they don't skip on the giant fresh Pitas either! We'll be seeing you again...soon!!"}
{"text":"We brought Mom here to celebrate her 95th birthday. The food is GREAT and the staff are accommodating.  Whenever we return we are remembered, and Mom is treated like family.  Our salads are custom made, since Mom and I can't eat green pepper; they are just like my grandma made in the 1950's!   The fish is grilled perfectly: flavorful and spiced just right.  The portions are large, and my family is happy because I am gluten free, so they get more of the special homemade pita that the restaurant is so famous for.  What I notice is that a lot of the EMTs and firefighters stop in for a quick meal. That is telling!  Yes, there is a few minute wait, but well worth it.    Ambiance is okay, its not a five star, but the price and value are great. Drink prices are $1.49 to $1.99.  The catering prices are a bit high, and they don't deliver, but I observe lots of people coming in for carry out.  Worth the drive from Sun City to Peoria.

{"text":"Great food great prices great service!   I used to be a pita jungle fanatic, but greek wraps is now on my regulars list."}
{"text":"Great menu options. Slightly small inside but overall very good food. Good place to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner. Hubby and I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Simply the best gyro around. Tender, flavorful, yummy! Gyro salad is crazy!  Big enough for 2 to share!  This place is always clean and the staff friendly!"}
{"text":"Can we say amazing?!? Greek Wraps sure can though! 

So I walk in to this little place in a strip mall with a random craving for falafel expecting to be disappointed by the food and service. Thanks to my fellow yelpsters I decided to give it a try though and thank goodness I did!! While the staff wasn't the nicest I can seem to care because the food was absolutely fantastic!!!!!!!!!

I'm almost sad that the portions are so large because I don't have an excuse to come back tomorrow..."}
{"text":"Thumbs down. Not impressed. Almost $9 for a baby sized lunch wrap (and I ordered the big one) with rubber meat. Rather bland. Maybe my expectations were higher because of the quality Greek food in Europe?

Do one if three things - A) lower the price, B) give me a higher quantity of food, or C) improve the quality of food. If they did any one if these, I'd give 3 stars.

Since when did $9 lunches become common? That didn't even include a drink."}
{"text":"Chicken kabob wrap was really fresh and delicious. Chicken was tender and not overcooked like some places. 
Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I've been to Greek Wraps several times since I live nearby and I always have a great experience! The chicken kabob plate is where its at! Also, the staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Man, I forgot how fresh and delicious Greek Wraps is! Took a long break from this place in protest following a phone order I had placed one night close to closing time that they somehow never prepared upon pick-up. I recall starving that night so I conveniently forgot about the joint for well over a year.

Until about a week ago. A friend offered to buy me lunch and brought up Greek Wraps. As a genuine garlic freak, I remembered that garlic sauce and happily agreed. Needless to say, although busy and bustling, my Gyro plate + eggplant app + tzatsiki was excellent! Generous portions of their amazing fare makes going to Greek Wraps (despite it constantly packed house) an extremely satisfying experience.  

The folks that run the place are mostly Syrian and quite gracious and accommodating. I highly recommend this establishment for all of the above. Just please keep it on the down-low as it's hard enough to find a vacant table as it is."}
{"text":"My family LOVED this place! The falafel pita and plate were amazing. Quick service and delicious food. We will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. Wait is alright. But they really need a bigger place than what they have right now. But better to max there place out than to never sell much food in a bad location."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! It's always busy when I come here but very worth the wait! I've tried many gyros places around the valley and this one is by far the best! It's very clean, and customer service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Visited tonight...We ordered take out it felt very authentic.  We got the falafel pita, salad, chicken kabob pita, spinakapita, & dolmades. The falafels were ah-mazing....the best I ever had in AZ maybe even ever!! From NY, so a bit of a food snob! Salad was fresh and light!!! The spinakapita was also fabulous...(yum yum yum,is what my brain kept saying as I slowly ate them)....wish they would make this on a larger portion as an entree not just an appetizer! Daughter had the chicken and she really enjoyed it as well! I also tried the dolmades and they were good, not the best but OK. The guy who took our order was super friendly, actually all of them were. Good vibe!!!

We didn't order the gyro but noticed they thinly shave the meat off the spit too.

Great place and when I am out here in the area, I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"If you like greek food, this is the place to go. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant, and I don't say that lightly. I've been to many Greek/middle eastern restaurants all over the valley, but none compare. Unlike many other Greek restaurants with mediocre lamb, Greeks Wraps gets it right every time. Also, you never have to wait very long for your food here!"}
{"text":"The two things that set this place apart from all the other similar \"Greek\" restaurants that have popped up in every strip mall are freshly baked bread and customer service. They offer wraps in two sizes, small and large. I would only buy the large size which comes with freshly baked bread baked right in front of you in a clay oven. Almost anything is good in the menu. The customer service is excellent so that you always feel welcome."}
{"text":"I just had the most amazingly delicious and freshly prepared food! Not only is this place always clean, but the STAFF is always smiling and so friendly and helpful. 

I drive 30 minutes from Anthem just to eat here and I am never disappointed.

The portions are so generous! Best value for my money by far.

Do not pass this place up!"}

exceptional service 
always busy
great customer service"}
{"text":"The Greek style chicken was amazing...never had such great chicken! Mister had a delicious gyros that went down really quick. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Clean, polite, informative and pleasant atmosphere and staff was great. The table was cleaned after each guests left, suggestions were made bases in my taste, price was fair, food was great!!clean and healthy."}
{"text":"I've found a new favorite Greek eatery in the Northwest Valley.

Fresh ingredients prepared as you wait truly deliver.  The decidedly un-ranch dressing tzatziki (hooray!) has just the right zing.  The lemon juice squeezed over the taboule gave the perfect finish.  And the shawarma... delicious.  For sandwiches, go for the larger \"wrap\" over the \"pita\" and take the leftovers to go; the tandoori-ed wrap _is_ that much better.

My eyes tend to be larger than my stomach, so I venture just beyond that 1$ mark; but there are certainly plenty of options within that price range.

Be prepared for crowds.  There isn't much seating room inside or out; I missed some table opportunities on my last visit and had to \"borrow\" a table outside from the establishment next door.  Regardless, I'm already looking forward to trying some more of the menu the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service, they make you feel at home, I come here with my family at least once a month, haven't been disappointed yet, the food portions are more than filling and I usually have to take some to go, if you haven't tried it yet gather your family, friends, co workers and any and everyone who wants to eat GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Glendale. Great food- very fresh.  But bring your patience, food typically takes 30 mins. Best to call ahead for take out orders."}
{"text":"This place has wonderfully fresh Greek food. And they hand-make wraps for each sandwich - fresh when  you order. Love their hummus and all of their roasted meats. And the pita and wrap sandwiches are HUGE! It's always busy here and once you stop in and eat you'll see why."}
{"text":"Best place for gyros. Been going here for years and it is actually better than it was years ago. Haven't tried anything other than gyro plate and gyro salad and both are great. Highly recommended. Salad is huge."}
{"text":"Family-owned and operated.  Excellent portions, quality, and flavors.  Staff are always clean and courteous.  Really can't get much better in the area for the $.  Going back again and again is a no-brainer."}
{"text":"The food is amazing but the customer service is horrible. When they say they close at 8 it's 8 sharp and the last 15 min before closing is rushed it's sad that a place like
This can have such great food but horrible service"}
{"text":"BEST GREEK WRAPS EVER ! I bring all new clients and friends to this place to show off what excellent wraps we have so close to my house. Staff is very friendly and after a few times of going there they will remember you by face. They always say thank you for bringing new clients in."}
{"text":"best greek in the west valley hands down. 

very nice and clean inside. friendly staff"}
{"text":"Love gyros!  This place is very good and quick service is a plus.  I've had the gyro salad, pita, hummus, and I was not disappointed!  I will be back for the falafel.  ;)"}
{"text":"First time here. I am very picky when it comes to falafel. This was top two in phoenix. Excellent gyro as well. Try it!"}
{"text":"Best gyros I have ever tasted. Meat is delicious and I love the home made pita bread. So soft and warm. Employees are all so nice. I'm assuming it is a family owned restaurant as I have see the same employees there for as long as I remember. My husband and I love this place."}
{"text":"Love this place it is always busy, the employees ate always friendly, and the food always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"The Atmosphere is great.  The inside is always clean and most times you can find Josh at the cash register.  Josh is a cash register ninja that always embraces special orders and makes sure the cooks know exactly how to prepare the dish ordered.  Hes always customer friendly and often delivers food to the customers table.  If no one is in line waiting to order you can usually find Him and the Young lady there cleaning tables and tidying up the place.  In all my visits to Greek wraps I've yet to be unsatisfied.  

Favorite Dish:
Gyro Salad, Double Meat, No rice, No Hummus, Extra Feta and 2-3 Tzatziki Sauce with a Medium Drink while dining in."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years and I can say that not only is it delicious and affordable, but that it is CONSISTENT. 

First of all, the gyros are the best I have had in the valley. The Greek salad is crisp with the perfect ratio of dressing and toppings. 

Second, I have never had to wait longer than 15 minutes at their busiest times and never had to wait for a table at lunch. Food is made fast (within 10 min of ordering it's on the table) and correct to the order. 

Lastly, I have never had a bad meal here. Like I said, this place is consistent. Different Greek restaurants have opened closer to my home, but I still make the drive to come here!"}
{"text":"Greek wraps makes the best shawarma steak wrap I've ever tried in town. I ordered the shawarma steak with 10\" bread after reading all the reviews of how fresh that type of bread is and it was the bomb!!. The sandwich was full of juicy steak meat, veggies, and sauce. I was full after eating only have of the sandwich. The price for a steak shawarma wrap meal is also reasonable. The is going to be my to-go place from now on for the best Greek wraps in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The absolute best greek place in the metro phoenix area (including Scottsdale).  The food is always fresh and plentiful.  The only gripe I have is that they haven't yet added Greek Fries to their menu; however, if you request them they will make them for you (Greek Fries are french fries with feta cheese and a greek/herb dressing).  YUMMY!"}
{"text":"A non chain in arrowhead and its yummy!  Try the flaming feta for an appetizer. Live that they have added a few bistro tables outside for additional seating and enjoying the nice AZ spring."}
{"text":"Very reliable Greek food in the West Valley. It's a very casual eat-in off of styrofoam plates or take-out. Try the chicken shwarma plate. The garlicky yogurt sauce is divine."}
{"text":"Have gone here several times and my favorite item is the Pita Steak Shawarma...it really doesn't get any better than this.  Well marinated meat and the flavor is fantastic.  Other items I have tried are the Greek chicken salad, Steak Ka-bobs, the fish...all excellent.  The salad dressings and the humus...all tasty.  What a great little setup for a restaurant.  Staff is friendly and restaurant is always busy...obviously the food is great and prices are very reasonable with good portions.  If you have a large party, you may not be able to sit together as this place is always packed...don't let that deter you though!"}
{"text":"I know people from the family who owns this restaurant, so every time I go in there, I am greeted with a smile. I've been going here for the past 7 years and never once have I been disappointed. If your looking for a decent place to eat, and you love delectable gyros, then this is your kind of place."}
{"text":"I don't get all the wonderful reviews. I was really disappointed with the food and the 20 minute wait for one small salad and one sandwich. The house dressing on the salad was probably the worst I've had at a Greek restaurant and the steak sandwich was just ok. Can't imagine we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I have a thing for falafel and it's pretty hard to find decent greek street food in this town.  I'm also not very adventurous when it comes to trying new restaurants. But when I saw they had falafel, I had to try it. I've tried the Gyros plate, the Falafel plate, the hummus, and several of the pita sandwiches. The large size pitas are huge. My fiance can barely finish and he's usually a bottomless pit.  The fries are crispy, the gyros meat is nicely done and the falafel is perfect--spicy/cumin-y but not overpowering, crispy outside, perfectly dense (but not too dense, ugh!) inside.  The hummus is some of the best I've had in Phoenix and the rice is really good, too, although it seems like they've changed it lately to be all rice instead of rice and fideo. The staff is very nice and the decor is clean and pleasant .  Thank you, thank you Mr Business Owner for opening this place. Keep cookin'!"}
{"text":"Freshly made and delicious! The Fam calls me a food snob, I must agree. I do have high standards and they surely exceeded my expectations. I could get addicted to this place. Will be a regular stop for me.
Try the steak kabob salad. Yummy."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with the chicken shawarma and the hummis is good. Staff is cool and down to earth. Restaurant is always very clean."}
{"text":"I love love this place! Friendly service and amazing food! Love the steak pita and their chicken is so tender. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best wraps in Arizona.they give a lot of food evry time never change the quality of the food.evry  things test really good"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I moved here a few months ago and was looking for a good place to eat. In Arizona, there are a limited selection on where to dine. But this place definitely hit the spot. Highly recommended. 

Family owned restaurant with excellent service. Will be dining here again soon."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to order out from in all of Arizona. I'm super picky about food so I appreciate consistency, and I've never been disappointed. I eat here all the time, It's that good! Hummus is awesome, pitas are always fresh, and the meat is delicious. The staff is always super nice too, even if they've got a huge line and are up to their eyeballs in orders, everyone is always friendly and helpful. Love love love Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I kinda love Greek Wraps.  It's a little hard to say this because the high school  kids that run the place can be a bit much at times but I can't stop thinking about the food.

I've been twice in the last 10 days and i ordered a combo Kabob plate with lemon chicken and steak both times.  I thought the salad, rice, kabob, pita, and humus were all yummy.  The best part was that it was more like two meals.  The first time I went I had to eat the leftovers for breakfast because I was still thinking about them the next morning.  I went again last night and it was just as delicious as I remembered. (The high school kids were up to their old tricks but just think of it as dinner and a show or take it to go like I did.)"}
{"text":"Large menu to choose from, food arrived  quickly and were kind enough to bring out to the table outside. That was a nice touch. 

Clean dining area.

The gyro I had was good. Solid, but not the best I've had.  There was just something lacking compared to some other gyros I've had. Don't get me wrong, I still liked it.

The hummus appetizer was good. The pita was a bit dry or maybe not quote fresh.

Overall, very good 3.5."}
{"text":"My business partner and I had been driving around for 3 hours that morning, and we decided that it was time for lunch. I had remembered seeing this place in the past when I had stopped by the Rubio's that is in the same center, so we decided to check it out. We arrived at around 12:30 and the place was packed...which I generally take as a good sign! We got in line to place our order and looked over the menu. We loved that the menu had pictures of everything...a major bonus! 

I decided to try the Beef Shawarma and she got the Gyro. We grabbed a table and waited just a few minutes for them to call our numbers. We both took a bite and loved our meals. I had never had Beef Shawarma, but it was delicious, tender and served with hummus and garlic sauce. I tried the Gyro meat, it was some of the best I have had. Everthing seemed to be very fresh, and the restaurant was clean.

I don't venture to that area too often, but next time I need to, I will try to make it around lunchtime since the menu had many more items that I would like to try!"}
{"text":"Was in Peoria i think for the first time ever, jaja. Went to Ford to get a new car and found this nice little gem. Pricey but they dont skimp in the food.
Greek gyro was favorful."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Excellent really!  Also, the staff is super friendly and outgoing.  They are always helpful with pronouncing the words!

Only thing, the prices are a little steep and they charge for extra dressing and other things.  That's my only thing!  

Even with the high costs, it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This inexpensive & casual restaurant has great food!!! I didn't mind ordering at the front and then taking my seat, considering the very reasonable prices. My mother had the kabob plate and I had a gyro, we also shared baba ganoush with their homemade bread. We liked everything except the steak kabob, though the chicken kabob was excellent. They also had a machine that poured over 100 types of soda, which allows anyone who doesn't drink soda to enjoy things like seltzer. This restaurant is a convenient choice for those looking to have a modestly priced, not to mention delicious meal."}
{"text":"Amazing food every single time I go and the staff is very friendly!! I go there at least once a week. My usual is the Chicken Shawarma Salad. Their salads are AMAZING! I also sometimes get the Falafel salad which is also amazing! If you like Greek food then this needs to e your new staple! So delicious! Every time!"}
{"text":"The best falafel sandwich ever. I'd eat it every day if I could. If you want Greek, then go here. The food and price will not dissapoint. I'm so glad I just decided to walk in and get something."}
{"text":"Best gyro I've ever had! And I've had a lot. Better than the one I had in Greece. I wish they had hot sauce though."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Greek food,
maybe if I was I would give 5 stars.
The only thing that I have tried here though is the chicken sandwich, pita thing. Sorry can't really remember what it's called.
But it was pretty good. They have this green sauce that is really good and very spicy which I love:)

I don't have anything negative to say,
except it can be kinda packed in their, but I know that everybody loves them.
So go give it a try."}
{"text":"Great great joint. Delicious food, friendly staff. Can never go wrong with a delicious gyro!!!! Way better than pita jungle!! I love the mom and pops feel of this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Excellent service! Very clean! Staff is always friendly and polite. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Best in phoenix for fresh greek pitas and hummis.love this place. dont need a huge review this place speaks for itself."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Their Menu is very simple and if you want to customize it they are very helpful! The girl on the cashier was very sweet and helpful. I came here with my parents and since they have been here before on their recommendation I got the 10 inch chicken shawarma. It's a great bargain for your buck. They r fairly priced and give you enough to pack some and take home aswell. Also don't forget to get their homemade fresh hot sauce (it's green in color). 

The staff was awesome aswell. They were very attentive and accommodating. I would highly recommend everyone to go check this place out."}
{"text":"I guess I'm one of the few people who wasn't that impressed with this place. I ordered the gyro plate to go and some baklava. I don't know if my expectations were so high because of the reviews, but I just felt so underwhelmed after I dived into my meal. The meat was a little on the dry side but the hummus was pretty good. I do intend on going back because I would like to give a different dish a try. The customer service was pretty nice so I don't want to judge the place solely on that dish. I'll update my review if I hit the jackpot and fall in love with my next meal."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always have excellent food! Wish they would build one in Surprise!!"}
{"text":"Greek Wraps is da bomb dot com (wait, do the kids even still say that these days?)

They are consistently delicious. Had lunch with the girls there today and grabbed some food to go. The Greek salad was amazing. Lots of fresh vegetables. 

Okay, I'm gonna be cheesy for a sec!  This place is clean and the employees are happy and care about their customers. They act like they WANT to be there. 

Bravo for being the best Greek place, hands down."}
{"text":"Awesome. Very nice. My regular stop. Made to order goodness. Worth the occasional wait."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about trying this place. As others mentioned, it looks & sounds like your run-of-the-mill mall eateries. I'm so glad I did try it cause the chicken shawarma is DELICIOUS! I moved out of the area but will continue to make the trek to this place again & again :-p"}
{"text":"Hands down best hummus and pita bread this side of town.  We usually get the gyros plate and split it. HUGE portions.  Super nice, fast staff.  Have been coming for years and years and have yet to have a bad meal here.  

If you're brave- ask for the spicy sauce.  It's fantastic."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you are around the area. They have the best shawarmas. The garlic sauce adds to the magic! 
Absolutely love the chicken shawarma and the fish shawarma."}
{"text":"Best lunch I had all year! Chicken Shawarma was absolutely fabulous. Gyro and Shawarma salad were also extremely good. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great Food! Overall service was Good! A little timely for just a gyro wrap. But I trusted that everything was fresh. 

No beer though. That is the only thing that holds me back from deciding this place or pita jungle."}
{"text":"I love this place.  People are really friendly.  GREAT FOOD.
I recommend Greek Wraps to anyone. I am vegetarian...  Salad is always fresh, Falafel is the best...
Thank you guys...

{"text":"I have been going in this nice and simple place for many times and can't even remember being disapponted because their food is really yummy, affordable and you will get out with full tummy plus you will say thank you The greek wraps for my good lunch :-) always recommended this to my friends."}
{"text":"Probably the best Gyros on the west side. They are a bit pricier than most other similar places, but it is worth the extra $1.50 for better flavor. I almost always stop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"By far, this is one of my favorites spot!! Any time I'm craving gyros, I'm here! I been having a lot cravings lately. Past 3 weeks, it has been once a week! My littlest toddler usually likes me to order the corn dog kids meal with fries, but I introduced her to the gyro plate and now it's the new winner! She didn't touch the corn dog after, instead it's older sister who finishes for her. She even eats the salad!  I love the balance in the dressing. I just wish there were olives on top of hummus and in salad, but hey! Either way! It's Delish!  My favorite is the gyro plate with rice, side of hummus and side of salad!  All the sides are big and I kill it every time! They are not shy with the meat!!! Mmmmmm thank you! The price is def worth what you're getting. 
Every time I visit, this place is usually clean and also busy and I can see why! They are genuinely nice folks behind the counter from their greetings to the goodbyes. It's nice to know that they are observant and with my little ones, they include and extra plate. Most places, I would have to ask but thank for you the convenience!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Love the chicken kabob plate. They never disappoint!! Friendly staff & delicious food."}
{"text":"Just finished late lunch there. Quite surprised to see so many people @ 3 pm on a Sunday. 
First, the place looks clean and very much like what we are accustomed in Europe. Second, the menu offers many options to satisfy any hunger. Third, the staff if friendly. Fourth, the food is quite good. Got a gyros plate and never had this quality in Phx area before.
Overall, a nice little place if you want to experience a good Greek taste in NW Phx (reference: food tasted in Greece a few years ago)."}
{"text":"I would have to say that this is the Hidden Gem of Glendale.  

I took a friend here from Atlanta and he still talks about it to this day.  He is always asking me to Fed-Ex him a gyro from Greek Wraps, and he is not kidding.  

The secret to this place is the homemade pita wraps ... incredible.  I will refund your meal if you go here and are not satisfied."}
{"text":"It's been about 10 years since I've had delicious falafel. The last place I used to go to for falafel on a regular basis was Hidyan Cafe in Boston's Fenway neighborhood. Man that place was good! Since I left that area, I was on a hunt for a replacement for a while but I eventually gave up. Then a few weeks ago a friend suggested we go to Greek Wraps. And guess what!...... I finallllly found the perfect place to fill the falafel void in my life!!! Yep - phenominal!!! You should go eat there NOW! And bring all your friends. They will thank you.
***Their hours are: Mon - Thurs 11a-8p, Fri & Sat 11a-9p, & Sun 11a - 7p"}
{"text":"Tried, falafel sandwich with pita bread and it was just ok only. It was Saturday, so it was too crowd where order was taken fastly by the billing counter lady and i asked her for suggestion and no help. I would say customer service need improvement and especially handling on weekends."}
{"text":"I get the steak kabob pita and it is awesome every time. The fries are good. It is one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I just had dinner at this place for the first time.  I ordered the chicken schwarma wrap, which was fresh, hot, well-seasoned and served in a hot, homemade pita wrap.  My boyfriend, who is a VERY picky eater, was impressed with his gyro.  Overall, the meal was a great value and we will be back next time we're in the area.  One word of advice though...the portions are HUGE.  I ordered a 7\" wrap, which was too much for my little stomach and my boyfriend's combo came with a mountain of hot french fries.  If you are a big eater or like leftovers, you will be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Simply the the best...love the freshly baked wraps you make the call on what to fill them up with chicken, gyros, shawarma or any of the many other options available"}
{"text":"Best chicken schawarma in the valley! I liked it so much the first time i went that i came back two more times that same week. (Not kidding). I love this place. Its a great little hole in the wall.  I have brought countless friends to his joint and everyone has loved it.  If you like spicy food ask for some of their homemade green hot sauce/ salsa. It packs a monster punch and has fantastic flavor.  This place does Greek food right.  Eat here. I promise you'll love it."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for just over a year and the food is ALWAYS great! Fresh and lightly spiced, homemade humus, mmm! The staff is always super friendly and helpful. I've brought friends here who said they didn't like Mediterranean food and they fell in love. My personal fave is the shish kebab chicken with humus and saffron rice."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I literally eat food from this restaurant every weekend.  I am a huge fan of the Chicken Kabob plate (garlic flavor).  The humus is absolutely delicious.   I have always taken my order to go but the establishment is nice.  There is also some outdoor seating for those beautiful AZ fall and spring days!

I am interested in obtaining nutritional facts about the food though.  I have asked but no one can provide me with the information.  Regardless, this is definitely one of my favorite places for quick and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love everything about Greek Wraps. The food and service are always outstanding, and the restaurant is kept very clean and presentable. When I wasn't vegetarian, I loved the chicken schwarma. This restaurant is vegetarian-friendly, so I still have no problem getting great food."}
{"text":"May have just had one of the best Greek Salads w/gyro meat that I've had in a long time ....I'll be back to try something else very soon !!  Opah !!"}
{"text":"Come here frequently and I was not disappointed once. Great service, they are always busy. There food is top notch quality and they spoil you with the amount given. The gyros wrap is my favorite and absolutely  love there salads.. And if you want a little bit of all there meats get the supreme kabob. Excellent!! So tender and fresh!"}
{"text":"This was a great little place to grab a bite. The gyros are a good size and very flavorful. They get busy, so don't expect food to come out fast. It is well worth the wait though."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for a couple of years. Consistently good and fresh food. Their pita is never dry and their meats are always flavorful. Good sides too! Wish they were open later than 8 pm though."}
{"text":"I've tried a handful of Greek restaurants here in town, including Pita Jungle which isn't too far down the street. This is by far the best I have had.  I had the \"Steak Schwarma,\" which was huge! It came with rice and a side Greek salad! I am looking forward to trying other menu options!"}
{"text":"Best gryo spot in peoria hands down. Not much needed to say but make your way to 73rd n bell and enjoy"}
{"text":"We love this place it's one of the best places to eat in the West Valley. They are almost always busy and for good reason, the food is freshly prepared after you order, the portions are great and the prices are very reasonable. This place is family run and they are very friendly. Lots of options for everyone's diet accommodations, with many healthy food options. Great for dinner and lunch especially for post workout meals."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I always get the 10in wrap gyro and it never disappoints. The staff are friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the food is the bomb! When I lived in Arizona, we would have food from here at least once a month. So when I came to visit AZ this week, I decided to stop by. Still the best. Every time I go out for gyros, I compare other gyros to Greek Wraps. They always come short to Greek Wraps and I walk away from the other gyro place with my head held low. You can see a tear coming down my cheek and a hopeless look. Greek Wraps is like an ex-girlfriend that got away. You compare every girlfriend to her and the new girlfriend fails in so many levels."}
{"text":"Wide variety and great tasting food! Amazing Amazing Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Would have given five stars but for the loud rock music radio station. The food wad great and the service friendly. When the music got to us, we just moved outside."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer since I moved to the area 5 years ago. It's my number one spot in town for gyros. What sets them apart is the availability of getting a standard pita or a 10\" wrap. The 10\" wraps are hand stretched and baked when you order your sandwich. I've tired just about everything the have stuffed in the wrap...souvlaki, chicken shwarma, steak shwarma, gyro...and they are all delicious. The serving size is always more than enough and always served fresh. In fact, I think a trip to go get dinner may be in order!"}
{"text":"The go to for Greek in this area of town. Always great food and service. Chicken Shawarma plate is always awesome and the Gyros are great."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. I've been here a few times and love it every time. I ordered the gryro platter and it comes with a Greek salad and rice. I have to say everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Best shawarma, dolmas good, fries are average and so are the spanakopitas! Egg plant dip was above average."}
{"text":"Wooooo!!! I love gyros. I have had great ones, and I've had not-so-great ones. These my friend, were some of the best I've had. My lamb was tasty as can be, tzatziki was flavorful, I had to pull out some blah pieces of iceberg lettuce though. I'm just personally not a fan of the iceberg lettuce. The BF had the falafel pita wrap. The falafel was good too- spicy, even. I've only had falafel one other time forever ago, so I can't really compare it to another experience. But it was tasty. The atmosphere of the place was nice, I didn't expect it to be so \"new\" looking. You can watch the cooks prepare your food right there, and everything is made to order and fresh. It was busy when we arrived (about an hour before they closed on a Saturday), and it just kept getting busier. All-in-all, I will definitely be visiting this place again. Maybe this evening!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place to me and I went for the 1st time yesterday.  I have had gyro's in many places in the west valley and without a doubt, these were absolutely the best. They have a 7 or 10\" gyro, I was hungry so ordered the 10\" - I could only eat half of it it was so large.  The meat was very tasty without being greasy and the pita it was wrapped in is home made goodness. I had rice with mine, which was okay, friends had fries & said they were very good.

Prices very reasonable for the portion size. Everything that I saw on peoples plates looked so delicious. I will absolutley go back, this was really a great find for me. Be prepared for a bit of a wait for a table if you go at lunch time, the place only has maybe 10 tables/booths available, though it does have some outside seating too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food!!!  Very fresh and tasty. Thanks for catering our event.

The food was hot and fresh and delighted our group of 50 plus!!"}
{"text":"Always good service but the food is great sometimes and okay another. We'll keep coming back because of the people."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken kebab wrap and it was delicious. The meat was juicy and spiced perfect. The wrap bread they use had a good taste of its own. Can say that the chicken kebabs were one of the best i have tasted."}
{"text":"The food here used to be good. Now not so much. I've made a few orders for my falafel and each time it just got worse and worse. I decided fool me twice shame on me fool me 4 times....well enough is enough."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently the best Greek food in the Phoenix area. I'm not really a Mediterranean food person, but their wrap bread and chicken are so good I go here regularly anyways. 

However, be warned! This is NOT fast food. A routine order will take 15+ minutes, and longer when they are busy. 

The service is pretty good as well."}
{"text":"I really liked this place... Chicken Shawarma was great... Get the wrap, it's fantastic... Only thought was for the price I would have like a larger portion of fries. But all around I liked it and will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent little place for salads, gyros and shawarma. The food is always good and fresh. 

The service is always good and the staff has remained consistent over the years which leads me to believe the ownership and management are good."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  Had chicken kabob platter w salad. Lots of food and all very tasty.  Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Had a Greek salad here since our regular Gyro place was closed.  The chicken was really good but the salad itself seemed a bit tasteless.  My husband said his chicken gyro was good.  The staff in the place were very attentive.  Made you feel at home.  Will probably return."}
{"text":"Great food, Fast service, Super nice staff! Ive been here twice and I really enjoy there chicken kabob pita."}
{"text":"Best beef Shawarma I've had in Phoenix! Best tzatsiki sauce I've ever had! They give generous portions of food! Greek Wraps is in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is probably the best greek food I've had in Arizona. 
They lose a star because it was overly priced per the proportions serviced."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I ate the chicken kabob pita, and it was the best pita I've had in my life! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We frequent this place at least once a month. It's the only good shawarma on this side of town. Good Flavors. Only complaint is the pricing. It's pretty high for this type of restaurant. We have a family of 6 and it usually cost us around $75 to feed 2 adults and 4 kids. Kind of steep for almost fast food."}
{"text":"I have a serious love for middle eastern food and this place doesn't disappoint. I've had the falafels, chicken and beef shawarma and gyro. All are amazing and very consistent."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my dad to get a meal and we were not disappointed.  It's not traditional, high end Greek food, but very good, solid mediterranean \"fast food\".  It was tasty, they had a lot of menu choices and it was quite filling with large portions.  We went on the early side of the dinner hours so it was rather quiet, but by the time we finished eating the business started to pick up.  It's wasn't too noisy, and the restaurant is pleasant.  I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Every time I've had food from this place I am never disappointed. I had an excellent experience today when I went in to order food to go, the woman at the register was extremely friendly and efficient. I ordered the chicken shawarma pita meal with a side salad and a soda. It was pretty busy in there and several people came in after me, however I waited less than 10 minutes for my food to be ready to go. This is a place that I will frequent more often as I've never been disappointed with anything here."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good and clean food, then this is the place to be at. I literally could eat there everyday. The place is always clean with a cool friendly staff. I am w big fan of pita bread and love the hand made 10\" bread with any combination of meat."}
{"text":"Now I can see what everyone else is talking about! Place was pretty full around noon for the lunch rush! Everything on the menu looked delicious! I chose the Greek salad pita and it was excellent! Great flavor and very fresh!!!!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm.  Yummmmmmmm.  And again, yummmmmmmmmmm.  Fresh and tasty.   XLNT service.  Friendly.   My first visit makes this my latest favorite !!!  Very flavorful.  Bread is my weakness (one of them at least) and this came to my table steaming hot and absolutely delicious.  Great job !!!"}
{"text":"Consistent fresh food.  Super yummy, the kabobs and fresh bread are as good as it gets!   Don't forget the hot sauce!"}
{"text":"Loved it!
Fresh food (I really liked being able to see it being made thru the glass) clean top to bottom & super personal service. Hands down the best gyro I've ever tasted... wonderful tzatziki sauce the meat was so tender & juicy. The price was about $10 and it was a huge spread of food. Much more they one person could eat. Rice, hummus, fresh pita and a salad. Everything was fresh & tasty.

Hosted by a male, dark short hair, thin... Maybe late 20's... When we asked, he mentioned it was his family's place.. He took a lot of pride in everything. He made sure everything was perfect with all orders, even catty-out. My husband and I felt as if we were sitting down to eat at a family members home (one that's a great host). He went ABOVE & BEYOND expectations. 

Only suggestion.... It was very apparent that the quality of products used were very good. From the thick plastic wear for carry-out to the awesome new coke machine with many flavors in the dining room...  definitely an A+. However, the Sweet & Low (a saccharin based sugar substitute) seemed out of place in a casual restaurant striving for high standards. A person that doesn't need to use a sugar substitute may not realize that there is a difference. Splenda is a little more expensive but I know when a restaurant carries it...  they have their customers in mind, not the 2 pennies per pack they'll save. There is a big difference in taste to a person that has to use it.  

Over all GREEK WRAPS is a great place with great food, We will return again. Definitely a value for the price. If you like Greek food you can't go wrong... it the best around!"}
{"text":"I must live in a cave. I just discovered this place through a friend. The portions are BIG, the food is delicious, and the service is fast and friendly. My husband is wary to try new things. I said just trust me. Ordered him the combination kabob plate. He's been dreaming of it ever since. See you soon Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"A great independent spot! Delicious gyro, shawarma and humus. We try to get here at least once a month, and that's a 10 mile trip. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, Always upgrade to the 10\" inch wrap.
7\" inch is store bought bread 
10\" bread is made in house (delicious!) 

Suggestions:
steak shawarma sandwich 
Falafel sandwich."}
{"text":"The food is great never had a bad experience! Their staff is always kind and eager to help. Nothing compares to this Greek restaurant."}
{"text":"Just great! No question about this place at all. Fantastic and fresh, and it all tastes so good. We went back a couple of times during our visit to town just so we could try different things on the menu. Hard to say what is best, depends on your taste, but whatever you like it will be good.  Mostly because it is freshly cooked while you wait. Not super fast food but doesn't take too long either, and you can talk to them while they are getting your food ready. Love a place that makes it's own bread - so fresh!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised!! This place is so unassuming from the outside looking in. I've driven past here a ton of times and had no clue that they'd be a contender in my current Greek food binge. First sign: I walked in during a Monday afternoon and it was jam packed for lunch. I ordered the Chicken Greek Salad. Exactly what I wanted in a salad. I was really impressed to find this spot on Yelp! Clean, quick, fresh/quality food, and most importantly great service. Places like these are rare to find in the valley, the west valley at that where all you find are chain restaurants. Will definitely be returning :)"}
{"text":"The service is excellent and the food is very tasty.  I love their 10\" gyro wrap and their salad is fresh.  You wouldn't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I won't lie, I was surprised at how good this place was. I really didn't think it would be. I got the combo plate chicken and falafel on the salad. The chicken is super tasty. Really tender and flavorful. The sauces, the tzatziki sauce is awesome. The hummus is awesome. I was just really impressed. Salad was solid too. Give this place a try, it's a pretty awesome."}
{"text":"There are many Greek and Mediterranean food in town, but Greek wrap it's one of a kind I have tried all of them I suggest for all of you to try Greek wrap. I have too much experience in foods so therefore take my advice and don't get confused with what to order, anything you order is good"}
{"text":"I am very discerning of Greek food and cuisine and Ive been to many Mediterranean restaurants across the valley. Greek Wraps is delicious and has so many options. It's filling and left my whole family satisfied."}
{"text":"This place is just plain awesome!  People are friendly and the food is delicious and the prices are extremely fair!  So come on in and give it a shot...you won't be disappointed!  Let Josh put a smile on your face...he is hillarious!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is always delicious and they never disappoint. Best Greek wraps in town! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. They make their pitas from scratch as you order, the food is cooked perfectly and garnished beautifully.  Honestly the best gyros in the country from my experience."}
{"text":"I think I found a new place to get my \" Gyro Fix. \" I came here today for the first time. The restaurant was very clean, staff was very friendly, and the food was very good. I judge the quality of Greek places by how good their Spanakopita is, and theirs was one of the best. Their Greek Gyro was also extremely tasty. I will be back to try the rest of their yummy menu."}
{"text":"Really amazing Greek food.  The shaved meats are perfectly marinated in Middle Eastern spices, roasted to perfection, and shaved to order.  The meat is served on a bed of rice and a scoop of humus.  The portions are huge. Super healthy salads as well.  One of the best Mediterranean joints I have ever eaten at."}
{"text":"I have nothing overly detailed to add that other people haven't already said, but this place is basically my neighbor and I have only been there twice. 

Both times though I was really impressed with their quality, and got a lot of food for my money. Yum!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Greek restaurant!! The staff is super friendly, excellent food, and perfect location! Check them out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago (where the gyros is an art, lol). Phoenix had yet to impress me with a gyros, or any Greek food for that matter. When I wandered into this place I really wasn't expecting much, but WOW!
Very friendly staff that really appears to care about customer service & some quality \"home made\" food. We had the gyros platter & chicken kebob pita. Gyro meat was good. Tzatziki is obviously made on site. Hummus is also obviously made on site. Both were exceptionally good. So none of the canned garbage that the rest of the Greek places serve. Chicken was extremely juicy & quite tasty.
We will definitely go back!!!"}
{"text":"When we used to live in Peoria, we would go to Greek Wraps about once a week. Their hummus is to die for. I've actually never had anything less than terrific there. Everything from the veggie pita wrap with grilled eggplant and onions smothered with their special yogurt sauce to their grilled lemon kebab with garlic sauce is amazing. 

There is always a line at Greek Wraps and expect a wait. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are plentiful. 

I wish they had delivery!"}
{"text":"My wife and I both love Greek and Mediterranean food, and this place rocks. I mean... totally rocks! The food is always good, and the service is great too. If you have what you think is a favorite Greek food place in Phoenix/Glendale/Peoria, think again. There's a reason this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Best wraps ever!!!
I was here on Friday the 28th of September, and It was great!!!
The place, is modern, well-kept and clean, with lovely images of Greece all over their walls. 
   *** I decided to go with their Lemon Chicken pita, with the Cesar sauce and the works in veggies, it tasted extremely fresh and healthy to me!!!
BEST WRAP so far!!!! Oh so tasty and also well proportioned, I would love to frequent this spot, but its a long drive from my home!! 

** One day we will meet again!!! :) **"}
{"text":"Really great wraps!! Friendly service!! We always get the steak shawema.. Great flavor, we also always get it in the home made pita not the other pita bread. So yummyyyyy"}
{"text":"Food was good, it was very messy but in a good way! It was messy because the portion was full, some restaurants don't give as much, and customers pay more money than what they get. Not at this place! Service was great too, the cashier came and brought me my food when I was sitting even though it was a to go order. I typically don't experience this so I thought it was nice."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I are obsessed with this place! We go for lunch a lot and they're fast quick service is amazing when we're in a to go hurry :)"}
{"text":"We live very close to Greek Wraps and frequent it often. I love local places close by. We do take out and sit down. I love the gyros. I would say the best I have ever had. My boyfriend loves the chicken shawarma. The rice pilaf is so good. The flaming feta appetizer is a hit as well. The food is always fresh and fast. The service is always top notched. We are blessed to have this wonderful place so close by."}
{"text":"sooo filling...we ordered the hummus appetizer(your average, creamy rich hummus), the tzatziki appetizer(tangy, cool yogurt sauce with green onions), and the flaming feta appetizer(fried feta cheese mixed with a creamy, spicy sauce...not awfully spicy--incredible), all of which came with pitas...

I also ordered 1 spanakopita to go with my falafel+rice plate)6 crispy, spicy falafel balls over yellow rice, into which I mixed tzatziki and hummus...mmmm...

Jamie had the shawarma wrap(massive, and with some hard-to-place spice that was absolutely tantalizing)...

I was definitely reeling after that meal :p"}
{"text":"This is a family favorite for us. Great food and great prices. I am a fan of the chicken kabob-platter (although it is A LOT of food), pita (make it a combo with hot french fries), or salad. Lots of options! Everything tastes real, healthy, and flavorful. Good West Valley spot for Greek food!"}
{"text":"Saw the amazing reviews but was dissapointed with the food. Got the kebab combo plate with beef kebob and some other beef. Both were very chewy and wasn't as flavorful as I would have imagined. The Pita bread and hummus tasted like it was from costco. The service is amazing but the food is just ok."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Had the gyro wrap with a side order of the fresh bread and some tzatziki sauce and everything was great. Wife had the greek salad with gyro meat and she really liked hers as well."}
{"text":"Has to be my favorite go to Mediterranean food joints.  Never disappointed and the food is always made fresh!"}
{"text":"Best Service, Chicken & Steak kabob plates are our favorites!  Everything on the menu is great & fresh!  Service is excellent even though at times a little busier.  I always place my order ahead of time and have it ready to go.  Have the large pita bread, made fresh their!  Try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We've never been to Greece or have had \"authentic\" Greek food at a fancy restuarant but I have had falafal and gyros and New York City so I'm basing my comparison on that and I think this place is pretty awesome.

We used to love going to Ararat's Mediterranean (sp?) and now that it has closed, Greek Wraps is our new fave.  It's a ways drive for us since we live way out in Buckeye but anytime we are out that direction, we almost always head to Greek Wraps.  

We've had their falafel and gyro platters/wraps and enjoy them a lot.  I think the falafael is a little on the crunchy side but I don't know if it's more authentic for it to be \"software\" or crunchy like they make it.  Their rice is good, too.  My husband even picked up catering for his work crew and they all enjoyed it a lot, too.

The service is pretty decent, too.  Nothing fancy but they greet you and help you out of you ever have any questions."}
{"text":"my wife been after me to go to Greek Wraps forever, finally, we went last night, she had the Falafel salad, I, the streak shawarma, loved both to the extent of eating everything they put on our tray. I asked about the cut of meat for the steak Kabob,the young man that was expediting the food offered us to sample, although, it wasn't from tenderloin, otherwise, they would have to charge double, it was tender, delicious, and generous sample portion, the Greek Wrap offers  whole food made fresh, truly healthier eating option. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, they can do little better with serving utensil, especially, the foam plates. we will defiantly be back again and again.    thanks for the hospitality"}
{"text":"For shawarma, I'd eat here...but I'd try a new place first.

Let me first say if you don't know where this is...it is hard to find.  Landmarks would be: World Foods, Old Navy, Mattress Firm, Rubio's...it's in the back corner of the strip mall that houses these stores.

Alrighty.  Service is quick and efficient.  A chicken shawarma meal is $8.18 with fries & drink.  The fries were not that great - I'd guess frozen from a bag.  The chicken in the shawarma was excellent and the pita bread was extremely good.  The problem is the rest of the sandwich.  There was not enough chicken, too much sauce (it was very drippy), and overall, not that satisfying.

I would say that if I had gotten a plate of that chicken on its own with some of the fresh pita bread and some hummus, I could have easily given this place 5 stars.  But we're ranking them on the wraps, and when the food was wrapped, I would opt to try another place first."}
{"text":"This place is legit. I used to come here once or twice per week while in school... wish I could make it here more often now. Whenever I'm in the area I try and swing by for a meal. I love the 10\" shawarma's, always solid. Order an extra tzatziki sauce."}
{"text":"I really like there food ... my only complaint was there falafel was eh,  other wise good food , decent priced huge portions... was crazy busy when i went on a Sunday.. I got the Gyro plate.. and Falafel and hummus ... took food home"}
{"text":"Yummmm!
Had dinner here- Gyro plate, kids chicken kabob, shwarma plate.  All were delish!  Meat was perfectly cooked, rice was good, hummus was great, and the salad was amazing.  I would definitely recommend this place. Bathroom was clean too."}
{"text":"Every time I go into this restruant is always so busy. The food is delicious and one of a kind. But the service could use some inprovement ... When I ordered I wanted to get a gryo with fries the meal but the girl cut me off very quickly and didn't even try to up sale me to the meal so I had to go back in line to order my side. Also they call out number orders when they should give out table #s because its very hard to hear in there and I couldn't hear them yelling for any number over the crowd so having the table number would help people get there food faster. Lastly they did not quote me a time my food would be done for a Togo. I waited for 40 minutes to get my order not knowing when I  would get it. All in all good food poor service. Nice people just need to get things in order."}
{"text":"Very nice establishment! They didn't make me feel rushed for asking so many questions!! Second time eating Greek! The food tastes delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and helpful, the food is consistent, portions are huge, and most important of all the food tastes great!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Sunday and had a hard time finding a place to sit. I had 2 pita sandwiches. The Falafel pita and the Chicken Shawarma pita which were both huge. 4  large pieces of falafel with lettuce and tomatoes and a garlic sauce which was very tasty. The falafel passes the crunch on the outside and soft and flavorful inside test. The Chicken Shawarma was excellent. The sauce makes this pita outstanding. The pitas were pillow soft.  I'm looking forward to trying more sandwiches and entrees down the road."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for anything Mediterranean, don't bother going any where else. We have ordered pretty much everything on the menu, and LOVED every single thing we try. Not only is the food delicious, the staff is always welcoming and friendly. Even after moving to the East Valley, we come back any time we are nearby and have yet to find anything that comes close to all the deliciousness this places holds."}
{"text":"First experience here at this location. We love Greek food, and this by far makes such wounderful food"}
{"text":"Delicious! This place is always packed because, the food is delicious! Reasonable prices for the amount that they give you. The steak and chicken kabob plate is awesome and so are the falafels. Everyone is nice and the service is great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is bomb. So many choices. The gyro wrap is so good. Pretty sure that's home made taziki and home made bread wraps. The staff is super friendly. Restaurant is very clean. And the food is so dang good man."}
{"text":"Best Greek ever! My absolute favorite restaurant. We eat here once a week. The Greek salad with chicken is the BEST salad I've ever had. My favorite is the Chicken Kabob Plate. Love the hummus too. You get a ton of food (enough for 2 meals). You have to wait about 20 mins for your food but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Wow.. I have been wanting to try Greek Wraps since I moved to Glendale in August.. finally did and it was AMAZING. Who thought you would find incredible kabobs in Glendale!! The hummus was smooth and creamy, naan was soft and warm, and the chicken on point!! I will definitely be coming back! The service was phenomenal.. so nice and welcoming!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food with the Awsome Kitchen Managers in the Greek Wraps. Only thing Chiquito is missing but he'll be tomorrow here"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was really good. I went with the basic gyro plate. I love meats roasted on a spit! This includes gyro meat, yellow rice, salad, hummus, pita, and portion cup of tzatziki.  It is a large portion, two people could easily share one dinner. With a drink the total was $10 and change.

Gyro meat was very flavorful! I liked the hummus. The rice was a little greasy, but not too bad. There were plenty of people here, so that's a good sign. I look forward to eating here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I love Greek food, always have. There are many Greek places in Phoenix so it's hard to find a good one. Greek Wraps is on the top of our list, Chicken Kabob Plate is seasoned well, although there have been a couple times when it was a little dry. Their rice is probably the best Greek rice I have ever had, I love the soft, fresh pita bread & the garlic sauce wraps it all together. The hummus is ok, not the best, not the worse but then again I love tomato basil hummus versus plain. The Chicken Kabob wrap with Caesar dressing is also amongst my favorite things to order here. My boyfriend loves the Greek Salad but always orders extra Feta cheese. They are always busy and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"This place is great, been here like 5 times. My favorite is the chicken shawarma, the meat is so tender and flavorful and the fries aren't that bad either.  

I have also gotten their plates and let me tell you its a lot of food, enough for 2 people I think. Salads are huge too!"}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly and the food is amazing!! Best hummus I've ever had. I used to get the chicken shwarma salad regularly, but the chicken kabob is so well seasoned that I think I'm switching to their plates, so I can get their delicious hummus too.

The bread they give you with either dish is nice and warm, and there's a garlic (or maybe tzaziki? sauce) with it that is perfect. I take anyone who visits and loves this cuisine to check it out!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! Fresh and delicious. The pita had the perfect texture and taste. And they had no problem cutting a wrap in half so that my kids could split it. Customer service was awesome. First time there, and it won't be our last."}
{"text":"Nice location. Good food. Fresh pita bread. You can't go wrong with this place. Busy during lunch time but it worth it."}
{"text":"Came with a few people for lunch and they had a good crowd.  Seating was tight but we made it work.   Menu was more authentic than pita jungle.   We ordered falafel, kabob combination plate, hummus, salads and the freshly grilled pita bread (which took a few minutes but was well worth wait).  Prices are very reasonable, portions are large and staff are friendly.  I am not from area but will return when return to the valley."}
{"text":"Food is great ! Service not so much , cashier was extremely rude when I asked if the kitchen would split my wrap in half she gave me attitude."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great food great service wraps are bigs and delish 
Hummus was outstanding. My daughter had the 7 inch pitta and I had the 10inch I couldn't even finish mine it was so big. Would recommend and plan on coming back soon the rice was amazing my son had the hamburger pita and he loved it overall great place"}
{"text":"I went here for my first time on a Friday afternoon around 2pm. The place was pretty clean and packed. 

I ordered the Gyros plate for $10.44 with tax. It included: hummus, rice, gyro meat, one pita, a side of your choice (salad or fries; I got salad) and a side of tzatziki sauce. The hummus was good. The rice was addicting! The meat was verrrrrrrry juicy and tender. The pita bread was SO SOFT! The salad was okay. Kind of old. The tzatziki was really tasty. I was extremely satisfied with the amount and quality of the food!

Let's talk employees- they're SO nice. They made sure I was taken care of. They were patient with me. They brought me my food. They even gave me a compliment! On their downtime, I noticed they didn't just stand there. They cleaned the lobby while waiting for others to come in.

Job well done, Greek Wraps! I'll return :)"}
{"text":"Awesome Gyro spot on the Weak Side!  

This place is legit.  We placed an order to go.  Tried the gyro plate and the grilled chicken salad with extra pitas and bread on the side.  

The gyro plate came with a side salad, pita bread, rice, and hummus.  It was enough for two people to share easily.  The salad was huge and came with some amazingly flavored chicken and also was enough for two people to share.

The pita bread was hot fresh and soft.  The tzatziki sauce was very tasty as well.

Some of the chicken meat was tough to chew but other than that this place was a great value and had great food.  

For everything and a tip we were well under 30 bucks.  I would come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"Really great Greek food.  Love the gyros.  Wish we had a place like this in my hometown in CA."}
{"text":"Although it has a generic name, don't let that fool you. \"Greek Wraps\" has the best fallafel in the city. It's not dry or overcooked. It's seasoned perfectly. The shwarma is also the best in the city. The kebab is tough and overcooked. Their humus is good but not very authentic tasting. This is better than Spices in Chandler and Phoenicia in Gilbert. Their gyros are good but many places make great gyros. Go here for the falafel and ask for the chile sauce"}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro. Very good. 
Would have it again.
Workers are very friendly.
Place gets packed. Which reflects that the food is very good.
I also noticed a lot of to go orders."}
{"text":"Our family LOVES LOVES this restaurant!!  We tell everyone.  My daughter requested the chicken pitas for her wedding reception.  It was sooooo reasonably priced and every guest absolutely loved their dinner.  My husband is a huge fan of the chicken kabob plate... I love the Greek Salad Pita.  Their Falafels are the best around and the humus is to die for.  I could go on and on!  And the bread... oh the bread!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant in a great location.  I've been here many times over the years, and stopped in for lunch when visiting a friend on a recent trip.  Their quality and service has not waned at all.  If you're near Arrowhead mall, and would like some great Greek food, you can't go wrong with Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"Great food , really great service , the gentlemen works at the cash register was very friendly,really enjoyed it !"}
{"text":"Great food, poor customer service due to the rudeness of some of the staff members."}
{"text":"Great food and a nice atmosphere. I always get the 7\" steak shawarma. Really damn good. The owners are really nice and the service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Hands down, best gyro I ever had. They were the first Greek restaurant I ever tried so I ventured out and tried other ones and those other places just don't seem to compare. Their food is delicious, portions are large, their French fries are crispy, and the workers there are super helpful and friendly! They also have a touch-screen soda dispensing machine (when I first saw one of these I thought it was the coolest invention ever!) The only disadvantage I see with this is that it slows up the time for customers to get their drinks since there is only one and there are so many options to choose from. Considering how busy it can get during lunch time, I think this could really hold up the line.


Otherwise, anytime I'm craving a bombastic gyro, this is my go-to place!"}
{"text":"Pretty good hummus, incredible chicken kabob, and of course a gyro with beef and lamb steak is standard. It's complete heaven. The rice is okay, nothing too special. Atmosphere is almost like you're in a greek or turkish neighborhood getting your grub on and handling ya business. Coming here more often."}
{"text":"The best place in town bin here more than 20 times always perfect try the hummus and the fresh bread"}
{"text":"Soooo good! I am only in Peoria when I need to go to my Acura dealership. I was going to get my back adjusted and there it was Greek Wraps! I have been told by a few people that it is a must go place. So happy I stumbled across it. The menu was awesome they are true to Greek food using REAL kalamata olives,olive oil, real feta,great tzaziki, shaved gyro which is the ONLY way to eat it (The pre-formed gyro is gross) and I believe homemade pita bread it was very fresh.At the moment I am not eating meat and usually that means only falafel at Mediterranean places but they had a very tasty and large grilled veggie pita they also had a fish pita and other non meat items! The employees a young guy and gal were also very friendly that is not always the case at a fast place they were patient answered my questions and had happy personalities. That alone makes me want to return with my family. I can't wait to try the meat dishes too! We need more places like this in Phoenix as they do all over the east coast! I wish they weren't so far away can't you move into the so called \"Greek\" fast restaurant on 20th & camelback that place is awful take us out of our misery!"}
{"text":"I liked this place so much for so long! I ate there maybe once or twice a month, but after awhile I got tired of it. They have amazing food and is definitely something I would recommend to another person even though I am for sure sick of it."}
{"text":"Very good food,huge portion for the price. Steak shawarma with the hummus is amazing."}
{"text":"Ok but there are better places around.

Tried this today:

We liked the combo appetizer that included  2 falafels,  2 dolmas,  humus, and Baba ghanoush.  All these Items had nice textures and flavors.

However the chicken in the Greek chicken salad, while a nice amount (about 5-6 oz) was quite dry to the point of needing to drown it in dressing to be able to eat it.

The gyro salad had less meat (shaved very thin so it looked like a lot, maybe 3 oz).  

The salads (main meals and in the appetizer) was basic with a basic dressing on it - nothing special.

The baklava was in a cooler with drinks (other places serve it room temperature).  The fat  had congealed some so it tasted greasy and it had a flavor like some of the dough was not fully cooked. Too bad as I think it would have been quite good if not served cold - nice amount of nuts, sweet but not too sweet, and the top layers of phyllo dough were flaky and crunchy.  

We also get the prices were on the high side considering the amount/quality of food we got - $10 a plate when I would have expected the prices to be closer to $8 for what we got."}
{"text":"Greek Wraps is good.  I've been there a number of times.  The food is always fresh.  I've never had bad service.  Sure, the place is a little small for the business it gets, but you deal with that.  It's just....this place never wows me.  It's fine for greek food (something that, in general, has never impressed me) but it's just nothing special.

If you do go, the one thing I can say is worth trying is their hummus.  It's pretty solid and goes great with their fries.  I'd recommend only getting that if you're with company though.  It's a lot of hummus to eat alone (trust me, I tried)."}
{"text":"Great place with delicious food! Super clean with a friendly and helpful staff. Try the falafel!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:   Soda now tastes delicious.  They must have put in a purifier."}
{"text":"The food is quite good and the staff are very friendly.  They are a bit overpriced, (hence the 4 stars), but overall a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Great Greek place. There is a pretty large menu with an array of items to choose from. They are relatively inexpensive. I really like their shawarma! One of the cool things about this place is they have one of the large coke machines with 100 flavors in it. I love it when I can get cherry vanilla Dr. Pepper!

This place has the feel of a small mom and pop shop. They have a pretty good number of tables and chairs inside as well as a couple of tables outside. It was pretty dim inside because they had the big shades down over the windows. I wouldn't mind a bit more light in the restaurant though.

When this area gets busy you will be parking further way from the restaurant that but it's just a short walk. Nothing to worry about.

The staff are attentive and are there to do their jobs but I don't think they would want to talk to you more then they have to.

I would recommend this place to try out. You have got to try the shawarma!"}
{"text":"I am officially addicted to their fresh bread and hummus. I wish I can get more than one fresh bread per plate (even you are willing to pay for it, you can only get one) this place is always busy for a good reason. A nice size outdoor space where you can bring dogs."}
{"text":"Wow! I stopped in here for lunch while in town on a business trip.  First off, the staff is great smiles, talkative.... Felt welcome.  

Splurged and got the supreme kabob plate.  Everything on the plate was great!  Chicken was juicy, steak was tender, beef was flavorful.  Their tzatsiki sauce was awesome but bring gum, they load in the garlic!  
Big portions for a great meal under $15 bucks.  I wish we had one of these back home!"}
{"text":"Very good steak gyro wrap! The bread was the best part and tasted fantastic! My new gyro spot in az. Also it's a good amount of food given so you're full when you leave"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the reviews here.  It has to be one of the best Greek places I've ever been to, and I've been to a lot.  The portions are HUGE! you won't go home hungry.  Great menu selection, great food, great everything.  I thought Pita Jungle around the corner was the best, this place blew it away.!"}
{"text":"Been here many times now.  It is our go to for gyros and especially gyros / greek salads.  

The staff is friendly and customer service is their goal.  Though they are not all family, it sure has a family feel.  

Nice clean business, can get a bit busy and noisy at times, but it is a gyros shop, you get what you came for.  We come often after church on Sundays (12:30 PM) and it can get busy and a line forms.  For me that means it is a good place."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after getting a massage at Hand and Stone. It is as delicous as the reviews sat! Had the 7\" gyro.. Food arrived fast!! Meat was well seasoned and packed the grittiness of other gyro places. Tziki sauce was great and had just enough on the gyro. Service is friendly and exceptional, they even came by again to make sure we were happy which speaks volumes in a semi-fast food kind of place.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Authentic, fast and flavorful. In the Valley of the Sun there are a lot of great places to eat , this jewel is one of them. The food is fresh and healthy and the menu is big enough to make even the picky break down.  Located in the West Valley on Bell just east of the 101"}
{"text":"I really don't understand how his place didn't get 5 stars. This is the best Greek food in Arizona. They cook everything fresh every single day. Every Time I come into this place it is packed, and the staff is super friendly. The food is excellent! The meat is always seasoned to perfection, hummus is fresh, and their bread is perfect!! I don't know how people to go other \"Greek\" places, and enjoy it. The owner is a wonderful person and because it's family owned that means you are always getting too quality. I used order big orders for my workers and not once have they mess up, given me the wrong thing, or forgot anything, and this was at lunch time so it was packed yet they took time to make everything perfect. Every time someone asks me where we should go eat I always say Greek wraps."}
{"text":"Love this place! The best Greek food in town! And the customer service is always great too."}
{"text":"This place is always the go to when you're feeling for some wraps. I always get the lamb, steak or chicken... Mostly chicken shawarma pita! Full of flavor and meat is hardly over or undercooked, it's perfectly juicy. We used to live around the area but we still drive out from 20 minutes away to get the gyros here because it's totally worth the drive! 

We've also tried their home made pita bread, it is 50 cents or so more than the regular pita but it's really good. Definitely worth the try for a few cents more."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I love the pitas, homemade! The people are always so friendly, service is quick and food is always hot and delicious!"}
{"text":"Ah.. really really awesome!!! Would recommend it to anyone. I have been looking for shawarmas and wrapsfor quite a while now.good thing this place was close to my hotel. I love the chicken kebab, the hummus was perfection, the pita bread warm and soft. Definitely a 5 star!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time today!  We ordered gyros and fries! Everything was good! It is quite a ways from our house but if in that area, would like to visit again and try other things on menu! Prices are reasonable and everyone was friendly!  Tables were kept clean and food looked and smelled wonderful! I would recommend to friends to try this place!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best..if not the best Mediterranean food I've had in Arizona. I'm from a state that quite a bit and this is much better! I highly recommend the food. My only problem is the tone/ rudeness I've experienced with some of the staff members...when trying to get a discount ( I've come on more than one occasion) I'm asked for my ID over and over. Sure that's not a problem but the tone with which it's done is what is very off-putting. Definitely a place to check out though."}
{"text":"After waiting 40 minutes for my food I asked the manager for a refund. She gave me my refund and said thank you for your business. I said you didn't get my business. There were several other people that waited over 45 minutes for their food and this lady did not offer any incentive other than saying I'm sorry. And then she spoke about in her country. We live in the United States of America this is our country. If you are not from America then go back to where \"your\" country is if you do not want to be an American. I served in the Marine Corps for the freedom that everybody has in this country. This is my country and it is the country of anybody who chooses to live here. If I wanted to live in Greece I would say that Greece is my country because it is where i call home. But because I live in America this is my country. If you do not want to be an American, please feel free to leave just as you have freedom to live in this great country as well. I will never go back to Greek Wraps again and a one way trip back to her country! I wish there was a way to give 0 stars."}
{"text":"What more could I ask for?! How about awesome conversation with the staff while enjoying my scrumptious shawarma? Austin, Martin, and the really sweet girl (whose name I didn't get who I thought was Martin's sister) were so awesome! They created such a warm, welcoming, family atmosphere that I felt like I was eating at home with family instead of at a restaurant. I mean, we even started having a conversation across the restaurant as Martin was tidying up and cleaning tables (didn't want to hinder him from working). 

Also, just an observation: I really appreciated seeing the pride that everyone had in working there -- it's difficult to find people that take pride in their work nowadays. Nobody was \"too good\" to help clear off tables and wipe them down or take an order. 

Thanks again for the incredible food and amazing experience! I will most definitely be back... And you're welcome, Martin, for telling you to find me on Yelp; you'll remember my name now (Hopefully). Haha!"}
{"text":"Cheap, local, delicious.

I now officially have a place to satisfy my gyro fix in the west valley.  Its a small hidden spot on the southeast corner of 75th Ave. and Bell that I've driven by thousands of times but never noticed until I consulted the yelpers.  To those of you who reviewed this place, I owe you one.

She got a 7\" pita, I got a 10\" gyro.  First off, my gyro was huge.  I never been so full from a gyro in my life.  Second, its true what the other yelpers say about this place.  All the food is made fresh right in front of you, which means its usually about 3-5 minutes until your order is ready.  The wait is worth it.  The gyro with two kinds of meat, lettuce, and veggies is booming with flavor.  Despite its sheer size, I demolished it.  Not as quickly as she demolished the pita, but she had a smaller portion so I'll call it a draw.  We both were more than satisfied.

The place is small and was extremely busy (on a Sunday no less), but the cooks worked pretty quick.  Meals are usually $5-$10 tops.  Mine was $8.  Probably wanna get here early for lunch as I'm sure its a zoo.  And yes, they have baklava too (though I didn't try it this time).

If you're in the Arrowhead neighborhood and need a Greek fix, you'll be hard pressed to find a better place than this.  There's few Greek spots around here as it is, but I'm proud to say that this place measures up."}
{"text":"Delicious Mediterranean food! Portions are huge and the meat is delicious, so well seasoned. I got the supreme kabob salad and would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"Much better than the gyros at the fair!  Lamb was tender, and definitely not skimpy. Fast service and clean fast food Mom & Pop."}
{"text":"This place is great! I go here every time I am over in that part of town. I have tried the gyros and the greek salad with chicken and both were excellent. The pita bread on the side came out nice and warm. Never had a good meal here always an excellent meal! I wish they would open a location in the east/north valley!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how I have managed to avoid this place for so long. I worked RIGHT across the street from Greek Wraps for 6 years and never made my way over. This will be one of my greatest regrets in life because this is some of the freshest, friendliest, most delicious food I have had here on the Westside! The staff was super friendly and helpful. I am not super familiar with Greek food so they pointed me in the right direction. I knew one thing, I wanted a \"gyro,\" and one of the best decisions I made was to listen to the guy at the counter when he said \"I recommend the 'wrap' instead of the pita\" He said the wrap was made fresh, they take the doe, put it on the hot plate, cook it, then wrap your food in it. It was SO GOOD! I ended up with the Steak Shawarma. The lettuce, tomatoes, onions, steak, and of course the wrap were so fresh. The meat was crazy flavorful and not grisly at all. There was just the right amount of hummus and garlic sauce. The portion was huge. I ended up taking 1/2 home, as they said I would. I also gave the Falafel with Hummus Dip a try. The Hummus was velvety smooth, not lumpy or grainy. The Falafel was fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was the perfect way to start my meal. 

I am pretty sure this is going to be my go to spot for a fast, good, very affordable, fresh meal from now on. This will be where I try all the Greek food I can for the first time. I cant wait to show my family this place and keep trying new foods. I am really disappointed in myself for not giving this place a try sooner. I have been missing out for sure. Not any more!"}
{"text":"Great food, great value. I went basic with the Gyro combo. My wife had the beef shawarma plate. She said it was amazing and a lot of food for $10. The classic Greek salad was terrific. I would definitely come back and would recommend it to all."}
{"text":"Most amazing Greek food I have had and the service is absolutely on par all the time! I tried My Big Fat Greek Express at arrowhead mall, the service was so horrible so i came over here and they completely made my day! Thanks Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"By far the best Greek food! I have tried other place and they just do not compare, this place actually gives you large portions. I have had the chicken kabobs, chicken shawarma, and the  gyro wrap!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Super fresh and not too expensive! Plus a lot of food for your money!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Valley. Tip - you must order the made-to-order wraps (vs. the pre-made pitas)."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Greek fast food restaurants that I have eaten at.  Customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek place. I think it is family run. The food is fresh and delicious and staff is super friendly. Their Gyro and Greek salad are the best around!"}
{"text":"This place is good!  The food is well prepared so expect to wait for your meal than have it whipped out in seconds.  The portions are huge so come with an empty tummy.   Everything was fresh and tasty.  This place is packed for a good reason!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal food- whatever you order!
Chicken salad is awesome, beef shawarma is excellent!"}
{"text":"Okay, so this review has been a long time coming. Not sure why I haven't written one in the more than five years since I've been coming to Greek Wraps, but better late then never. I LOVE this place. I've had Greek, Turkish and various Arabic cuisines in many cities and several countries, and the stuff they serve here is right up there with the most flavorful I've ever had.

Primarily, the fact that they make their own bread fresh to order is what gets me salivating when it's coming close to lunchtime. They have 7\" pitas or thinner 10\" wraps. I get the latter. They're delicious. I'll either get a chicken kabob or shawarma wrap, typically with a side of falafels and a side of dolmas (vine/grape leaves). Their vine leaves are the cold vegetarian versions; none of that disgusting hot stuff with pine nuts and meat. Falafels are excellent - they don't taste store-bought and sludgy but have great flavour with a very nice, subtle peppery aftertaste. The shawarma is fantastic - marinated enough to give it a delicious zing. Me eating a wrap is like putting a piece of paper in a shredder - I absolutely decimate the thing nonstop from start to finish and have to watch out that I don't chew my own fingers off towards the end. I've had baklava once or twice from here, it's not too bad either. And thank god they don't serve ridiculous Chicago-style hotdogs here. Last I checked, Chicago wasn't in Greece.

Greek Wraps has always been extremely popular, especially at lunchtime, and it was always way overcrowded. The \"Jersey Shore\" (cracked me up) dudes prepping the food work pretty furiously but still it takes quite a while to get your meal, sometimes 10-15 minutes or longer. Toward the end of last year they did a MUCH-needed renovation and pretty much doubled the interior space - I remember walking in and then doing a doubletake since I didn't recognize any of it. Even with the added space it's still almost always full up at midday. Great prices, the absolute best Mediterranean take-out on the west side (I like Pita Jungle equally, but that's a different range/style of foods) and well deserving of your cashola. For dessert, assuming you have room (typically unlikely), you got your choice of a Jamba Juice or a Juju Berri in the same strip, or else walk across the carpark to Cost Plus World Market and pick up a coupla import chocolates like Milka Nussini or Cadbury Flake. Mmm.

Edit 20110615: BLEAH!! T Greek Wraps now stocks the infamous Abali \"yoghurt soda\" which I first tried at Haji Baba's down in Tempe. Disgusting - BUT!! I was super excited to see it and actually bought a bottle to drink. Do not ask me why. I grimace every time I take a swallow of it, but maybe I like it because of the Warhead effect - some sort of mild endorphin rush you get from challenging your taste buds to something they aren't thrilled with. Anyway, add another imaginary star to my review just for this stuff alone. See my pic. http://j.mp/jIYTCK"}
{"text":"Best little diner in the North Valley.  I discovered this place when a co-worker (from Greece) told me that this place served the best Greek good this side of Athens.  That was about 6 or 8 weeks ago and since then I've been back to this great little treasure about 5 times."}
{"text":"Wow, I do not take the time to write a review almost ever and when I do I don't remember ever giving 5 stars and I did for this restaurant. Very nice and friendly staff food is delicious. I'm stunned on how well I was treated and how good the food was definitely will be recommending this place to co workers friends and family"}
{"text":"The staff was very helpful in explaining the different types of food.  I've had the beef shawarma and the gyro.  Both were excellent.  Love the Greek salad."}
{"text":"If you are a vegetarian, they have a veggie or Greek salad gyro. I got the Greek salad one and it stated great. The eggplant was good and the kiddo liked the falafel. Which is a miracle since he he is very picky. The pita was fresh, warm, and soft. The best type of pita. Great place that anyone that loves Greek food should try."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere and relatively fast service. Come early or call ahead as it gets busy at lunch. My husband had the original gyro plate which he was very happy with. I decided to try something new which backfired on me the sharwama. Too many spices for my tastebuds ! Usually I like this dish elsewhere and I'm used to middle eastern spices this was just an overload of spice without harmony. Everything else was excellent though and I enjoyed the owner cashier very much!! I will return and just try a different dish :)"}
{"text":"The food and service here are great. There is a nice family atmosphere and it is easy to tell that great care is taken in preparation of the food. It's clean and the decorations within the dining area are simple yet modern. The people working at the restaurant are very nice and I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Great food! Their hummus is delicious and lots of food with every order!! My whole family loves it. We usually get the chicken shawarma plate and the gyro plate. That feeds four people. The only thing weird is they give you a number for carry out (over the phone) orders rather than give them your name and I'm forgetful so I always forget my number by the time i get there lol"}
{"text":"this place boils over with flavor!  The chicken shawarma pita!  That is all! Tell em to make it spicy! and get the 10''

Seriously soo good though, I love the ethnic flavor here, it permeates through the front doors.

Plus you know a place is good when you see a bunch of cops and firefighters eating there on their breaks ;)"}
{"text":"We love this place! My hubby and I share the gyro plate. Its so big and has so much meat for us to share it! Very filling and we like that it's a healthier alternative to a lot of the fast food joints around and for $10 for 2 people it's affordable. Meat is juicy, rice is fluffy, my hubby loves their pita bread and I love the greek side salad."}
{"text":"This place is great! Been here 3 times in two weeks. The food is good, service is friendly. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles, CA and found this place to have some really yummy food! The customer service provided by Angelina great! She was super sweet and helpful which made our dining experience awesome!"}
{"text":"Ok..lets start with yum, add another yum and end it with yum yum yum. Small place, looks clean, and very busy for Saturday at 5:30pm. Always looking for a middle eastern restaurant, don't let the name Greek Wrap full yea. It's ALL Middle Eastern. order shawarma wrap, rice, and fries. Don't judge it's my cheat day and I am hungry. Service was great thanks Angela, appreciate the smile and warm welcoming. The food turned out amazing, seriously I mean amazing. Keep in mind my orders come with do's and don't and they got it so right! Make sure you try out this place. It ended with a big YUM!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and let me say it will not be my last. I arrived right when they open and they all ready had people waiting for their food. The staff was nice and helpful.  The place was very clean and they have plenty of flavor enhancers such as olive oil and vinegar but it is not needed because the food is tasty as is. I ordered the gyro pita with a side of salad (other side options where french fries or rice). The pita was delicious but just a pit salty to my liking. The meat was nice and tender but with a nice crust on the outside. It seems that they cook it on a rotating spit. The salad was also delicious with a nice simple greek dressing and feta. They messed up my order by giving me fries but right away correct it by giving my salad and also the fries. The fries were good and basic nothing special. They have a nice full menu to choose from and have one of those new digital coke machine with many different drink options. Next time I will definitely get one of their salads they look great and were a good portion. The restaurant got pack 30 min after they open that is a very good sign. Thank you for a happy full belly."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!

I was a little confused on how to order when I walked in because it was so crowded. I thought it might be a sit-down type of service. However, you do have to order from the counter up front.

The cashier was very friendly. I told him it was my first time and he told me what was good. I went with the Supreme Kabob plate ($14). It comes with chicken, beef and another one that I wasn't sure what it was. I ordered for to-go because they closed in 20 minutes and the tables were all filled up. My food took about 15 minutes and I was off!

When I got home and opened my to-go box, WOW. There was HELLA food. All of which was delicious! I didn't finish it, so now I have lunch for tomorrow!

Keep up the great work! This place rocks my socks."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great prices...wonderful people and service...a quick and delicious lunch! Always busy but they get your food to u quickly! We go here frequently for lunch hour and never have complaints!"}
{"text":"In a wasteland of \"Friday Mc Charlie Something Or Other\" chain restaurants, Greek Wraps is fresh, good food from some nice people."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! This place is a hidden gem. Iv tried several different entrees and haven't been disappointed yet. The only thing that sucks are their hours. Sometimes they close pretty early. But I guess family is important to them so you can't be too upset about it. Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this restaurant while out from LA to visit my sister. It had great reviews and I was pleasantly surprised to see how packed it was upon entering the restaurant. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We ordered our food \"To Go\" and we didn't wait too long for our orders. 
Regarding the food ... The Tabuleh was too coarse and chewy with a heavy olive oil taste that I did not expect; the hummus and spanakopita were meh; the falafel patties were dry and  flavored with curry which  I have never tasted before in a falafel patty and am not sure I like; the tzatziki sauce tasted more like mayonnaise than Greek yogurt with no dill or cucumber flavors; the handmade bread is probably best eaten there because it was very chewy and tough as it got colder ... and the worst yet, they did NOT pack my dessert! The 
Overall, our food was ok ... Not great. I think the meat dishes are probably better though I don't think I'll be coming back regardless."}
{"text":"Love them. Food is always good and fresh. Our order has always been as placed and we've always received wonderful customer service."}
{"text":"I've been here before and I remember it being good.

So today when I was starving, (I'm pregnant) and I didn't know what I wanted to eat and grouchy out of my mind I decided I wanted to come back and eat some Greek food!

I ordered a hummus app- delicious!
Perfect amount for 3 people I'd say. Hubby and I went to town and there was still some left.
We also ordered a beef shawarma combo on 10\".  yummmmmmmmmm! 

I also got a gyro on 10\" delicious!!!
The only mistake being is I didn't add feta on this. They're feta is amazing!!!
Very nice waitress. :) we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is my typical go to greek place that consistently delivers good food at a reasonable price. 

My usual order is the steak kabobs which are tender but also has a nice char on the outside. They also have fresh bread which is amazing to use as a wrap for the kabob.

The service here us usually quick and from my experience, generous. Occasionally they'll give extra fresh bread or add a salad when you didn't order one. Definitely a plus for extra food!"}
{"text":"Always awesome, great service, delicious food! Good price! I always get a pita gyro with extra tziki sauce (sp?) And fries!! Addicted!"}
{"text":"We're on vacation in Peoria and my wife wanted greek food on a whim. This just happened to be the closest place to us, but I'd definitely drive across town to eat here again. We ordered small Gyro and the Gyro Plate. Man, $6 for the small Gyro has to be one of the best deals out there! It's so meaty. My wife enjoyed her Gyro plate as well. The tzatziki sauce was very delicious, and the veggies that came with each meal were fresh and vibrant. The only thing constructive I could say is that the rice is a little under seasoned."}
{"text":"FORGET PITA JUNGLE. I know i have 5 star reviews for the, but this is so much better!  Chicken Schwarma was BOMB!!  I will be making this a weekly or biweekly thing with my Girlfriends daughter."}
{"text":"2nd time in 2 weeks ordered gyro plate to go and received wilted, slimy salads!  So gross.  Very disappointed! Also, ordered the large flaming feta appetizer both times and only received 1 piece of pita bread.  Management must have changed...greed!"}
{"text":"If you desire a fresh break from Arrowhead Mall's Food Court this might be your destination as all the food we tried seemed fresh and prices seemed very low.

This is casual dining. You order at the counter and the food gets ran to you.

 They advertise they bake their own bread and that is usually a sign of a better place.

I tried a Combo Appetizer so I tried a variety of things. The Dolmas were good and the salads were fresh. The Eggplant Dip had way too much tahini in it so much that it was overpowering and heavy for my taste and lacking of eggplant. I prefer eggplant dip when you taste the charred eggplant flavor. The Falafels lacked fresh herbs and tasted very flat but were edible.

I should have complained about the Iced Tea. It was Brown Water. My husband tasted it and said it tasted like water too. I was afraid to drink it and was very thirsty.

The bread was fresh and seemed good.

Overall not the worst and not the best but better than food court food."}
{"text":"Super delicious food that doesn't leave you feeling heavy or greasy. I'm never disappointed and end up here at least once a week for lunch. Everyone I've brought here always leaves happy. Only reason I don't give it a 5 is because it can be pricey for lunch. 10 bucks for a plate. But again, I love it too much to say no."}
{"text":"I had the Gryro. It looked better than it actually tasted. It was very bland and was surprised they didn't have any good sauces to throw on top. When I bit into it, all I got was mouthfuls of ranch dressing. The pita was pretty good, unfortunately it was the best part of the gyro. The french fries were really undercooked, and bland. Very friendly staff, nice relaxed feeling inside."}
{"text":"By FAR the best Mediterranean food in AZ. I live in Chandler, and will drive 40 minutes just to get this stuff. All the meats are flavorful and juicy, the rice is soft and the pitas are hot. Hummus is also kickass! Place gets pretty busy, so make sure you know what you want when you go in! This is probably my favorite place to grab a quite bite in all of AZ. I wish I could give it 6 stars!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Greek restaurants to eat at. My very first time was last summer with my friend. We were taking classes during the summer and decided to eat here. She had been before but I hadn't. Then I went again with my boyfriend these last couple times. And this last time was my favorite because I discovered my favorite dish. The steak shawarma sandwich. It was sooooo good! If you don't like steak, there is a chicken version of this. Oh and I found out one of my friends from elementary school works here which is really cool. Good food and friendly pekoe. :) the steak shawarma had some type of seasoning that reminds me of Indian food. Not only reminds me but they use it in Indian food. I just don't know what it's called lol. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Their food is amazing. I got takeout on my last visit to AZ, and everything was fresh, hot, and so good. Their pita is fresh made, and worth the visit alone. The hummus tasted very fresh and zesty. I wish I lived closer, I'd be eating there weekly!"}
{"text":"Loved the wraps here! The food was delicious and sooo fresh! The salad had the freshest veggies. The chicken shawarma was cooked to perfection . And to top it all the customer service was excellent. I will definitely be stopping by here the next time I'm in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always get the chicken shawarma plate and it is so much food. It has lots of chicken, hummus, rice, and a salad. I think it's about ten dollars. Everything is so flavorful and fresh! They people who work here are always very friendly and make sure you have everything you need. They always get busy around lunch time so I would recommend calling in if you are in a hurry. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Never disappoints. Even my Greek food hating husband loves eating here. 
We moved close by about a year ago and eat here at least twice a month now. Food is fresh and well made. Great quality food and the staff is really friendly. Little bit of a wait for your food, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing food here.  Love coming in for a Gyro on my lunch break or when I'm getting off work.  Pretty quick, super fresh and healthy.  Very authentic too, I love it.  I'll be back soon for another gyro!!"}
{"text":"This place has some delicious wraps,the chicken kabob is my fav.the kids menu has a good selection as well."}
{"text":"Wow! 
Three letters, and only one vowel does it a disservice! 
Marking this in my repertoire as another great Yelp! Find! 
We had the hummus, falafels , gyro plate and mixed kabobs. 
All a home run, and We'll definitely be back!
Lots of foot traffic picking up to-go orders is always a good sign, too."}
{"text":"I honestly don't give out 5 stars too often, but this place is really good and I highly recommend it. The service is great, the food is exceptionally good, and it is always clean (unlike most mediterranean restaurants I seem to visit). 
I recommend the Chicken Shawarma Salad, healthy and tastes great."}
{"text":"Been back 3-4 times this year.  And discovered the gyros wrap.  Great!  This place if fine - only one thing keeps them from 5 stars in my book, and that's their Greek salad.  The dressing needs a real improvement. Try the restaurant at Happy Valley and 67th to see what I mean.  But back to Greek Wrap....the people are Great!  The gyros meat is delicious.  Lots of pride in the place and it shows.  Even when they're busy at lunch, they keep the tables and the floor clean."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to Greek restaurants since moving here two years ago. The staff is friendly, and attentive. The food is cooked fresh and the flavor is great. Everything we have ordered has been delicious from gyros to chicken shawarma plates, sides and desserts."}
{"text":"Gyro Greek salad was quite large, tasty,  not a great taste to the tzatziki,  too much dill.

What I appreciated most about the place, which happens to be a hole in the wall in a strip mall, was the customer service.  Very friendly and cool peeps.

I would definitely stop back when I happen to be in Phx."}
{"text":"Love this place! It never disappoints. The chicken shawarma and the falafel pita are my favorites."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Greek Salad I've had, I like a place that has consistency in their staff, seems like its always the same folks there.... Hummus is bad to the bone, It would be nice if they had an option for veggies with the Hummus plate rather than pita, but pita is sooooo good..... JJ"}
{"text":"My Valentine and I went here on the 14th of February mainly because we were at a loss of where to go, and we wanted something fast. Checking yelp, we decided on Greek Wraps because of its four star reviews, and I must say that I agree. 

Though the staff may look like a bunch of Jersey Shore rejects, they are without the attitude that makes one \"from Jersey.\" 

The menu is pretty extensive for a walk-in Greek place. I got the Gyros Wrap and an order of baklava. My Valentine got the Falafel Wrap, and we split the hummus and pita appetizer. Everything was delicious. The meat in my Gyros was very tender and juicy (not dry like most of the places I've been). They also make all of the pita fresh as you order it. 

I will return for more of this delicious grub soon!"}
{"text":"My favorite Greek restaurant.   I've enjoyed everything I've had here.  Clean, affordable,  and most importantly delicious!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints, the food is fun, flavorful, and always on point! The staff is fast friendly and courteous. I came in with my mom and my 9 month old son, they were helpful in asking us what we needed extra for my son. At the end of the meal I felt bad cause we made a mess. They told not to lift a finger and that they will take care of everything. I also had ordered a falafel wrap for my wife and they asked if they could make it at the end of our meal so it could be as fresh as possible. It was my Moms first time going and she said that she will be back for more. They are true example of how food should be made and how friendly customer service should be. I will always look forward to my next return."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place if you are ever around the phoenix area.  I ordered the chicken Kabob plate and portions were pretty huge.  As part of the meal, I got a side of salad and a side of hummus mixed with Pita.  I didn't care too much for the salad but the Hummus is delicious.  The pita bread is warm so it's not like most places where they just took it out the fridge.  Also, this was the first place I went they used the high end soda machines (the ones at AMC theatres)."}
{"text":"They have one of those Coca-Cola machines now for a wide selection of beverages. Service is friendly and timely bringing out your food. Still recommend the plates if you are really hungry. Two of their plates can feed my family of 3 no problem. I enjoy the rice more than the fries here too."}
{"text":"We love eating there - dine in or take out! My husband used to work quite close to there, so it was often also the lunch venue for us to meet for a quick bite together. It gets VERY busy there though for lunch time, so be warned!

Our kids love their food too!

Another huge advantage for us is -  they don't use garlic in the gyros or in their Tsatziki sauce (it is in some other items though, so please check with them!) 

My husband is allergic to garlic, which has pretty much made Greek food an impossibility  for him - until Greek Wraps! I could finally introduce him to some yummy Greek food!

Love their Gyros wraps!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great food. Never disappointed leaving this establishment. I really enjoy their food and also supporting a small family run business."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!!  Service was fantastic.  You can tell it was family owned and operated.  

I ordered the chicken and steak plate.  It was big enough for two people.  The meats was tasty and juicy.  Rice, hummus, pits, salad, etc all delicious.  

I'm already looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix.  This will be my first stop!!"}
{"text":"King Gyro is still king of local Greek places in my book. A patient of mine recommended the location due to Armenian authenticity. Well, I thought the gyros was good and filling. The fries were ok but the tzatziki sauce is a little too dilly for me. Don't think I will be back unless somebody else is craving it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's busy because it's awesome. Clean always. 
Their food is all made in house with exception to the pita bread, but the handmade bread is amazing!
Their kabob meat is always awesome among with their saffron rice and falafel.
Can't say enough great things about this place. If you like Greek - gotta come here!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Greece and traveled extensively throughout the Middle East, I've had my share of authentic Gyros and Shawarmas.

That said, Greek Wraps definitely delivered authenticity in my experience.  I'd like to see the price a little lower than $7 for a 7'' Gyro if I were to give Greek Wraps 5-stars, but I'm content to give them 4 stars for a great-tasting Gyro which was loaded with meat.  The service and cleanliness of the order at-the-counter then sit style restaurant was solid."}
{"text":"Wow...just thinking about this place and writing a review is making me hungry. I went in here wanting to try something different and ended up getting something amazing! There are a lot of great menu options and I like that they give you a choice to have pita or wrap for your meals. 

The interior is actually really nice and it seems like they've got a lot of regular patrons. I can see why since this place is always clean and the staff is always friendly. I'm just glad that I've got another food option when it comes to lunch. I'm even thinking I might go again today :D"}
{"text":"One of the best Greek restaurants I have ever eaten at! I come here a lot at lunch since they have an affordable lunch option that is quick and delicious."}
{"text":"I work about a mile down the road and it is our regular.  Many of my co workers are finicky eaters, but all agree it is consistently the best greek food.  They are always busy and efficient.  Of course large portions, and you can watch as they prepare the food so freshness is never an issure."}
{"text":"This place is really something. Have been here 4 times already and have tried something new each time and have never been disappointed. Their meats are so flavorful and complement their special sauce so well. Can't go wrong with the wraps but go for their platters over rice. Up there with the likes of Halal guys in NYC!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! The food is fresh, well made and tasty...I'd give it a 5* if they weren't playing country music whenever I go in to eat!"}
{"text":"This place is the amazing Greek Food !! Hands down period !!!!! Im an executive in Food Beverage Industry and  this place is clean, authentic, FRESH, courteous,
I cant recommend this any more --- but to say .. just go and try it !!!!! Amazing"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic!!!  The hummus is the best I've ever had!!  And the service- wonderful family owned business that obviously takes pride in what they do."}
{"text":"I think I may have found our favorite Greek restaurant in town. 

The chicken kabob schwarma was a medley of different flavors, and about as authentic tasting as it comes. Even the pita it comes wrapped in is made there and is noticeably better. The staff all seem very kind and there's a wide variety of items to choose from, right down to white or dark meat chicken. Fair prices and a military discount to boot. This place is now a regular stop when we're in the Arrowhead area. Hands down, the best schwarma I've had."}
{"text":"I and my hasband always miss Greek Wraps.Prof is clean,simple,rasonable price,good volumes, frash,really taste good and looks healthy.the  place is little small so if you want  eat with relaxed,Take-out is the best way.Most of times are busy.if you like farafel,try the farafel with special souce."}
{"text":"Best Greek place in the area by far. Quick and easy walk up and order. Service and fast and employees are very friendly. I enjoy the classic Gyro, rice and small side salad. Portions are large. Cheese does come on almost everything. Ask for an alternative sauce if you are lactose intolerant. I believe it is a garlic sauce- very tasty! This is a staple for us."}
{"text":"Delicious gyros, always made to order & wrap style (instead of pita) is the best! We eat here often and have always had excellent service."}
{"text":"Cannot get enough of this place, so fresh, flavorful, and good!!!! The hummus is good, the chicken kabob wrap is amazing and the pitas to die for."}
{"text":"The Best Gyros we've Ever had!  Consistently delicious
Definitely get a Gyro on their handmade Pita"}
{"text":"This place is really really good. The only reason I'm docking a star is because I've come around lunch twice and both times they've messed up my order. Nonetheless this place is great for a chicken kabob pita wrap. Also, the lady (the owner I believe) dropping off orders around lunch is a little rude and in a rush. I asked her when she dropped off my wrap if it was a chicken kabob and she replied \"whatever you ordered that's what it is\" and my order was wrong."}
{"text":"my wife and I love the food and the service !
they make the best Mediterranean food !
we tell all of our friends and family members about the 
GREEK WRAP IS THE BEST !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm very picky about the food I eat and especially picky about chicken. I decided to give this place a try and it was awesome. I tried the Greek chicken salad which has awesome flavor. This is the best Greek restaurant on this side of town."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place.  We didn't know what to expect from a really simple-looking joint in a strip mall.  But it really was awesome all around.  The employees were super-friendly and helpful.  The food was just perfect, some of the best Greek we've had anywhere.  Portions are huge, and price is good.  The place was packed but service was still fast and very friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food! My parents would take us here often and when they did it was a great treat for us :) brings back good memories and gives you delicious food. My personal favorite spot to go to when it comes to Greek Wraps."}
{"text":"This place is great! The service was very friendly and everyone is working hard.

I love the chicken kabob with a small greek salad.  The salad is perfectly dressed.   The chicken is quality white meat breast seasoned great with awesome flame grilled flavor.  

They do a great job of keeping the place clean and visiting the tables to ensure your meal is correct.

I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Been 2 plus years since I've been here and this place is still doing great business and taking good care of the customers 

I got the gyros and it was stuffed with plenty of gyro meat, tzatsiki sauce tomatoes onions and lettuce.  In a warm and soft buttery pita bread. You don't get it any better.    My dad got  the gyro ceasar salad.  Again loaded with gyro meat  olives and pepprocini in it

Picked up an order of dolmades to go.  Fantastic!!!!

If you need a Greek fix, head to Greek wraps.  They will makes sure you get exactly what you need."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Greek/Mediterranean places in the West Valley. Maybe the best. It's always packed at any time of day, and the house baked pita bread wraps are incredible. They beat the dried out chewy pitas at some other pita places, hands down. This place is also definitely a culinary step up from the standard gyro places that also serve hot dogs and pizza. The ingredients are always fresh and the meats are never overly greasy. 

I always order the Chicken Shawarma plate with an extra pita. Upgrade for the home baked, you won't regret it. The rice, hummus and salad that come with the plate make it a fantastic value.

Side note: one star taken off because there is a slight bro-tastic vibe going on here, and it's occasionally weird. Maybe it's all the ads for gyms playing on the flat screen? I don't know, the customer service is always prompt and kind, so there are no complaints this way."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town!  Great service, very fresh and reasonably priced! The salads are huge and delicious, very fresh and crisp. Appears to be family owned and operated. If you like gyros then you will love this place."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place but never got around to trying their food until today. Food was amazing and everyone was really friendly! I will definitely be coming back and I'd recommend this place over Pita Jungle anyday! Thank you for the yummy food and awesome service!"}
{"text":"I eat at Greek Wraps more than any other restaurant I think.  I really love it!! The only thing I have left to try is the pork... My fav is either the gyro plate or the chicken Shawarma pita. The way to go is to get the combo plate and an extra pita, split it between two people (cuz there is tons of food!), try a little of all the best (chicken Shawarma, gyro, steak).  It makes for a great dinner for under $20 for two :)... Who ever takes my order is always very nice. It is kept clean.  Great place!!"}
{"text":"Food is good as always . Very sad that there Coke machine was out of diet . Server was good. The place was clean . Food grade by the city was A ."}
{"text":"It's amazing!!!! I love this place, and they always have the best costumer service as well as amazing food ALL THE TIME!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot explain all the stellar reviews. People must not have many good Mediterranean options around here. This place is mediocre at best. Beef shawarma was borderline inedible with tons of gristly connective tissue and artery/vein chunks. It was also dry, weird texture, and just gross. Poor quality meat. The steak and chicken kabob were passable/good but I've had much better. The Kefta which they call \"ground beef\" was fairly good. The rice is totally bland and not done correctly. Salad was dressing was bland. Hummus was good. The \"garlic\" sauce was literally ranch dressing and tasted like mayonnaise. It was not good at all I can't believe they dare call that garlic sauce. The homemade Pita bread was more like pizza dough. I asked to sub regular bread for the homemade with whatever upcharge and she said our food didn't come with Pita and to just add it. Well she shows up with 4 Pita breads (2 homemade and 2 regular) what a waste of bread since we just threw two away. If you're ever in Mesa try MVP Pita, they are excellent. I'm not from Phoenix but just happened to be in the Glendale area that day."}
{"text":"Fantastic shawarma. The bread is made while you wait. The sauce, delicious. Staying near here, I preferred it to go rather than eat in. 

Go Eco with your to-go take away containers."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Greek place. I ordered the combo kabob plate with chicken and steak. It also comes with a salad, rice, hummus and pita! Everything was seasoned perfectly and the meats were tender and juicy. Even better than the food was the customer service. All the workers were very friendly and even brought my puppy who was waiting outside with my boyfriend a bowl of water. I will be back soon and often!"}
{"text":"So far from my drop from Chicago to Arizona, this is by far the best place to eat at, assyrian operated. The meats are all juicy and marinated, and the prices are affordable. The employees are working hard and people are always familiar faces within the staff. The average meal is a dish, then an option of fries, salad or rice and lastly a drink. Overall, I would come here to eat again. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I have never eaten anything here I do not like. The food is always fantastic. I usually get the chicken kabob wrap. Lately I have been getting the veggie wrap and both are amazing. I wish I could get one of everything. The meat and the bread on the wrap are always very fresh. Be prepared to wait around 20 minutes for your order. Worth the wait but you may want to call ahead to order."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros wrap! Good food, friendly employees. No alcohol, but a good selection of beverages!"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and this is the best I have had in Arizona. The salad and lamb were so fresh!  The dressing was amazing. The people working there were so nice and were so accommodating. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Greek/middle eastern food I've found in the valley. 

The shawarma comes in two sizes, and If you get the larger size (10 inch wrap), they use laffa/pita bread that they cook right behind the counter. 

I really like the steak shawarma wrap meal which comes with a drink and your choice of fries, salad or rice. I get rid of the garlic sauce that it comes with and ad tahini instead. Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great Greek food. Awesome staff. 

I recommend the chicken shawarma wrap and also the falafel plate. So tasty."}
{"text":"Really awesome. Staff is great, food great, pita really great. (I sound like Tony the Tiger ... there're great!). 

Anyway, I'll find myself here more often because it's clean, yummy, and it appears that all the customers were enjoying the food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!! The staff is super friendly. My only problem with this place is they have the soda machines that have every flavor combo, so it makes regular soda taste funny. But I asked if I could swap out my soda for a bottle of water, and they allow it. One of my favorite places in the city to eat"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. I love that they have one of those coke machines that has over 100 drinks to choose from. The Falafel, Gyros, & Greek Salad is excellent. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love the gyro and the steak shwarma. The classic greek salad is yummy as well. They are super great with substitutions too! Hummus is way better than across the street at pita jungle. I would love if they delivered but the service is always so nice and friendly it makes up for it! If you're ordering fries ask for them extra crispy, or else they are a little too soft."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Phoenix area !!  Food is always delicious and fresh!  Definitely recommend and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is alright. It's not bad, but it's not amazing either. I know this place has a close to 5 stars overall rating on yelp, but this is a 3 star place at best compared to other greek wrap places I've been to (in California!). I ordered a 10\" Gyros wrap and a hummus appetizer (basically a plate of hummus dip with 4 pita bread slices). 

The 10\" wrap was a huge portion, you definitely get your quantity here. The gyros was cooked well and crispy, but the wrap didn't have a good balance between the sauce (hummus) and vegetables. After a while you get tired of eating it because the taste gets monotonous and overpowering. It should be a medley in your mouth, but it's really not.

The hummus wasn't that amazing either. It's fresh, but in terms of flavor, it could be better.

Kudos on their hot fresh pita bread though, at least they nailed that down."}
{"text":"They were great!  They let me order a combo kabab salad  it was perfect. The chicken and beef were tender and spiced well. A few more olives would have been nice, but there was plenty of feta and dressing. The salad came with pita bread which was decent."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is consistent every time I come here. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro, it smelled like a gyro, but when I got home I realized they forgot the gyro :( 

Instead I got a side of gyro meat & rice. I at e a little bit & the meat wasn't bad, but alas, I needed something more!"}
{"text":"Used to have take outs from here. Today we stopped for lunch and had chicken kabob salad and ground beef kabob salad. Both were super delicious even without dressing. Portions were too big and had a full box left over to take home. Will be dining in more."}
{"text":"If you're looking for fresh Mediterranean this is the place to go! The food was so fresh and you can see them cooking the food! Everything came out tasting great. I ordered the steak kabob plate. It comes with rice, salad, pita, & humus. Who doesn't love humus?! It had great flavor. The staff is friendly. My meal was $15.00 so not extra cheap, but comparable to most Greek restaurants I've been too. The only complaint was the steak was a little tough with fatty pieces, but this isn't a steakhouse so i wouldn't expect filet mignon lol. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"this place has amazing wraps, by far the best greek salad I have had in a long time. MUST HAVE!!!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight with super high hopes.  Unfortunately, my hopes were trashed.  I'm one of those people that requires efficient and half friendly service.  That is totally not what I got here.  The young kids (I know, I'm probably too young to be calling anyone that) were irritated by the presence of pretty much every customer in the place.  It also didn't help that the young girl at the register was fawning over one of the chefs, to the point that I witnessed inappropriate touching.  A child walked up at one point, and politely asked for a glass for water, the counter chick gave her the death look for absolutely no reason.  They were just rude, and bad service really turns me off.

I ordered the chicken kabob plate which came with a salad, hummus, pita, rice and the actual kabobs.  The kabobs were nothing spectacular and the meat quality turned me off.  Everything was pretty mediocre, except the hummus which I thought was a bit better than average.  

Will I try this place again?  Maybe- I'd likely give it one more chance (because locally owned places are hard to find in this area of town), in hopes that the service would be less ridiculous AND perhaps go the route of the gyro that many other reviewers have mentioned."}
{"text":"Very fresh and delicious. Could eat their chicken kebab pita sandwich all the time. The seasoning is top-notch and the chicken is very flavorful and juicy. And the pita itself is so fresh and fluffy. Fantastic place!"}
{"text":"Uhhh best chicken shawarma I have EVER had!! We drive way out of our way to go to this place. It is always packed when we go there but it is definitely worth the wait. They make their items fresh to order which is a HUGE plus for me."}
{"text":"This was the best lunch I have had in Peoria since I started working here six months ago. The chicken kebab pita was delicious. Very fresh pita, flavorful chicken and good service. The restaurant was mobbed at lunch, but the food came quickly and the manager even managed to ask how my meal was. It is clearly a well run and popular establishment."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best food.  Always so friendly and always so courtesy towards their customers.  I recommend the combo kabob.  So yummy."}
{"text":"Its really upsetting bc their food is so bomb and delicious, but the guy that works there is so extremely rude.  Wish they could work on their customer service because im a regular customer and would expect better attitude."}
{"text":"So far the best Greek we've eaten in and around Phoenix.  Falafels are great and the homemade bread is ridiculous!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. This place is one of my Favorites. They have a Chicken Shwarma Wrap that is Killer. This place is very clean and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Best CHICKEN SHAWARMA IN ARIZONA!
Family run business and very very friendly. This place is always packed as the food is simply amazing.  The steak plate is also amazing and only $10.  You get a huge portion as well. I go here a couple times a month.  If you love gyros, shawarma and falafel you MUST GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Great food, good selection, good price.  The hummus is excellent!  We love the gyro sandwich and wrap, and the Greek salad with or without gyro meat.  The shawarma is very flavorful.  Convenient location and very friendly service make this place a winner for us."}
{"text":"Good Greek food. The Gyros and Steak Shawarmas are pretty good.  Friendly service. Very dimly lit restroom."}
{"text":"Glendale is pretty limited with non-chain restaurants so finding this place was amazing!

All of the kabob plates, the gyro plate, and chicken and steak shwarma plates are delicious! 

They seem to be relatively busy all the time, so it's great to call in for pick-up on busy nights like Friday! 

Easily became one of my favorite Glendale restaurants. If you haven't tried it, TRY IT! Friendly staff, too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly, quick service. This place is usually packed so you know it's good but the line moves fast. I could eat here every single day. The food is fresh and extremely flavorful. I had a bad experience with the falafel at Pita Jungle and so I decided to try them here and WOW, they are to die for. I'm so happy I live so close. It is worth your trip!"}
{"text":"So I have been craving Falafel...haven't had good falafel in at least a year.  MMM - that cucmber yogurt with romaine in a delish pita.  

I saw this place and saw they had falafel, so was stoked.  Order a large meal.  Well, not sure how they truly do it in Greece, but this place put's some lettuce, tomatoes, falafel, and ranch.  Very americanized if you ask me.  

Won't be back.  The search will continue for good falafel."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at this place, and everyone I have ever brought here has loved it!  My picky eater begs me to take him here for the chicken kabab... I love the original chicken kabab wrap and the salads..."}
{"text":"So usually I'm a chicken shawarma or greek salad kinda gal but my aunt recommended that I try the steak shawarma WRAP (not the pita) and OMG it's amaze-balls!!  It's probably not the healthiest thing one could select from the menu (which by the way, there are plenty of healthier options there) but seriously, you have to try it at least once if you're a meat eater.  It's so tasty and the wrap goes perfectly with it!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed by this place.  The ground beef kabob is the only good thing i've had there.  There rice is bland and not a good texture, seems like instant rice or something.  their humus is kind of bland.  the chicken i had was rubbery.  The bread and garlic butter stuff is good and fries are good but overall disappointing.  Their meat except the lamb is halal so i've gone there a few times and will probably at some point be back only because a lack of options."}
{"text":"Outstanding.  You know how you try something then you have to try it again, it was that good?  This is that place.  Gyros are delicious. Nice Pita bread.  The Chicken Schwarma done with the thigh meat is \"the best in the valley\".  Good people. Clean restaurant with excellent service.  Our go-to place when shopping on Bell Road."}
{"text":"The BEST Mediterranean food i've had in the west valley. I'm a huge critic when it comes to food like this, but this place blew my mind."}
{"text":"Man my first time here was a blast! The counter girl was cute and funny. She gave my order number and it was 65. I asked if I could have 69 and she said no they skip that number . She was clearly joking. But when that number came up and she was about to call for it she gave me a heads up. Both my girl and giggled like children. More importantly than the service being nice and funny, the food was so delicious. And they give you such enormous portions you can't finish. For what I paid and what I got. Man it was a steal! Place is nice and clean too! They were tidy and organized. Plus they kept asking if we were good which I always appreciate! Come here fo sho! Get anything on the menu especially the chicken!"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times in the past without any issue. I went with a group of coworkers during our lunch hour. We ordered our food and 3 of 5 of us received our food promptly while the last 2 waited 30 minutes for our wraps to arrive. When I asked the server if our food was almost ready, she rudely cut me off and did not allow me to finish my question. Her response was defensive and not even a valid reason why we were still waiting. The food was yummy but we had to eat it in 5 minutes so we could get back to work. Customer service was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Everyone I have taken here loves it. It is always crowded, so you know it is good.

My mom and I really like the falafel. I havent had a falafel that good anywhere else. It is perfectly fried and has a lot of flavor in it. Sometimes I get it in a pita, or on top of a greek salad. It is really good.

I also love the hummus and pita bread appetizer. Another good app is the taziki and pita.  The baby loves to eat all of those.

My husband always gets the schwarma (sp?) wrap and says it is great. You can get it with a meal deal that includes salad or fries and a drink. The fries are fresh cooked and delicious. His only complaint is he can't get it spicy enough.

Even my in laws who do not like most foods like this place, so you know its good!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite greek place in town. They have such a big variety but I always get the chicken kebob wrap with a side salad. Excellent food and good service all in one. Will definitely be back real soon."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say how busy it was- but so worth the short wait. We ordered the flaming feta as a starter and it was DELICIOUS to say the least. The bread was fresh and hot, and slightly crispy which was perfect for our liking. For an entree we ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate and Chicken Shawarma Salad. The salad was really good, and the chicken was really yum. The plate- eh. The rice had no flavor or taste, and the chicken they use was obviously chicken thigh, it's was tender and cooked great but was no my favorite. I ended up eating half of my boyfriend salad and only the hummus off of my plate. 

Overall, I loved the salad and appetizer. I also want to mention that there were 2 young guys working there, and they were incredibly nice and came to Cheka on us twice and had really superb customer service. For those reason, I will be going back for feta dip and salad!"}
{"text":"This is one of my all time favorite places to eat.  The staff is friendly and the food is fantastic.  You can't go wrong with any choice on the menu but my favorites are the chicken Greek salad or the chicken kabob plate. 
 The salads are always fresh, the chicken is always flavorful, the rice is delectable.  The portion sizes is generous.  Great value for money.  
Seating is occasionally a problem when it is busy.   There aren't many tables.  They appear to be very clean."}
{"text":"I had never had Greek food that I liked.... Until I went to Greek Wraps. Now,  I'm obsessed! Their portions are so big that my husband and I always split the #gyromeatplatter and leave stuffed! Ask for extra white sauce you won't regret it."}
{"text":"By far the best Greek place for gyro wraps in AZ. Although the wait time is long, the food always comes out fresh because they don't make your food until you order it, which I prefer. I recommend getting the larger gyro  rather than the smaller size because they use better homemade bread on the larger gyros. My go to dish is the half steak half chicken plate, which comes with pita, and a tasty Greek salad. Also their garlic tzatziki sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"There are so few restaurants that aren't chains in Peoria it's nice to find an original like this place. Their food is fresh, authentic and delicious. The chicken kebab was fabulous and so are there gyros... The only thing they could do better really is to enhance their Greek salad dressing. It's not tangy enough for me... Other than that this place is a winner."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now and love every moment of it. It's always been crowded but once you experience the food, you'll see exactly why. I also liked that they had vegetarian meal choices as well as a soda machine that gives you a plethora of flavors to choose from. The staff is always patient and welcoming and it's nice to get a glimpse of the kitchen from the counter and know that your food is not being tampered with and cooked properly. They also have a kids menu with a mix of American and Greek options to choose from. I look forward to trying thier desserts next"}
{"text":"Ordered a steak kabob wrap & spinakopita and they were both Amazing!  My friend enjoyed his gyro wrap & falafel.  Great service, excellent food.  Will be back..."}
{"text":"Great falafel! Hummus was absolutely delicious, service was great very clean place . We will be back to try more."}
{"text":"I've never received anything less than perfect service and a perfect meal. The appetizer combo is a phenomenal deal especially if you don't eat meat. Falafel, dolmas, hummus, babaganoush, tabbouleh, greek salad, pita bread and tsatsiki sauce. I'm full for days but I always want more!"}
{"text":"Delicious gyros and overall friendly staff. Reminds me of some of the mom and pop places back home in MI. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've lived here 28 years & was convinced gyros in AZ were the worst. I had given up trying to find a good one. I can't say how many times I passed by this place, being tempted to try just one more, but would keep going, not believing I'd ever find anything here like back in NYC.  Today I gave this place a shot & OMG!!!  It was SO GOOD!  So glad I finally stopped & never gave up the search!  I can't wait to go back & try the shawarma & everything else!  Very nice atmosphere for a takeout place, if you choose to dine in...very welcoming, attentive & friendly staff....I love this place!"}
{"text":"WoW is how I will start this.  I stopped in here due to seeing other good reviews and man were they right. The Food was great, and I tried all my friends food too. I had the Chicken kabob and it was delicious. Clean place. Staff was welcoming and the bathroom was clean ( not always easy to find). Try this place if you feel like Greek food, you not be disappointed!!

Update: came back during the busiest time to see if things changed. They didn't. Staff handled the crowds well even laughing and smiling, great ambiance they create.  My new favorite lunch stop."}
{"text":"Omg this Greek food was amazing. 

My sister took me hear for lunch when I was visiting. I ordered a chicken pita sandwich (can't remember the name ) it was spectacular. So filling and every single bite was delicious. I even went back to the same place and ordered the same meal, the very next day! Customer service was good, a lot of smiles and genuine concern for the customers . 

A gem in Glendale. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"One of the BEST places I have ever been to. Clean environment fresh food. The combo platter and the STEAK shawarma plate/ WRAP is amazing. Tasty food and great staff"}
{"text":"Best F-N  food at Arrowhead and then go and give it a try if you don't like it I will pay for it I will tell Angie we look great service"}
{"text":"The best Greek food I have had since being back stateside! I lived in Germany 15 years and besides Greece no better place to get these! Wow they brought me back to the good old days! Thanks for wonderful locale. try everything nothing bad to choose from!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was amazing! Tried the steak kabob wrap and it was cooked perfectly. Enjoyed the garlic sauce that came on it. Can't wait to try the rest of the items."}
{"text":"Greek wraps is one of the tastiest places I have ever been to. Their gyro is superb, and their falafel is one of the best. If you go, definitely get the \"Wrap\" vs the Pita. The wrap is freshly made, and it really adds to the meal.

The rice is incredible, the dolmas are ok, they might be pre-packaged, but my Fiance and I have been going there since they opened, and we've loved it. The owners are very nice, and yeah, sometimes it does take a little bit of time to get the food, but really, should you be in a rush to wolf food down your throat? If you want that, theres a Burger Slop down the road."}
{"text":"Outstanding. I don't give out five stars often but they deserved one. Fresh, delicious and friendly. If anything the only complaint was plastic forks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants ever! I love this place. I've been coming here for years and don't see that changing anytime soon. This is another one of those places where everyone seems to be a regular. The food is just phenomenal. Everything they serve is made on site with the exception of the small pita breads. The best falafel I've ever had. My standard order is typically the combo kebab plate with chicken and steak. Out of this world. Even their \"basic\" gyro wraps are ridiculously good. The quality to price ratio is outstanding. The staff has always been top notch. I recognize the chef's faces for years now which should tell you something. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing food so happy I found this place. Its so fresh you can go wrong with anything you order"}
{"text":"I'm back!!! Love this place it's so damn good and healthy. Smiling faces and quick service!!"}
{"text":"This is really one of the best wraps places I've been to in Az. If you have had Greek food in Chicago or New York, this is as close as it gets in the North valley. The hummus is the best I have ever had and they give you a nice portion when you get the chicken kabob plate. My husband likes the Greek salad, which is loaded with gyro meat. It's a little pricey and sometimes you have to wait a bit for your order, but they give you more than enough to justify the cost and the food is fantastic! this place is one of my favorite!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Every this is consistenty good and prices are reasonable with large portions. Same people have been working the register a long time. I have used their catering several times as well and they never fail to please. The only recommedation I would make is that if you're using them for take out, check your bag first to make sure you have everything you should. Somethign has been missing on more than one occasion."}
{"text":"I don't normally venture to the west side, but I was attending a conference in Peoria and my coworker and I were craving Greek food for lunch.

It had hits and misses.

We shared the hummus to start. The hummus was tasty but it had a bit of a weird grainy texture. And it could have used more lemon. The pita it came with was yummy and perfectly toasted.

I had the falafel pita meal. The falafel pita was very mediocre. The falafels weren't zesty or crispy on the outside. The french fries that accompanied them were dull. 

My friend had the chicken schwarma salad. She liked the chicken itself but said the salad was drippy and watery.

Service was fast, friendly, and efficient. No complaints there. 

If I lived closer I would probably give Greek Wraps another try. However, I live 20 minutes away and Chicago Gyros and Sabas more than satisfies my Greek craving in my own vicinity."}
{"text":"The best greek food I have every had! This place is always busy because their food is so good. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu. I recommend trying something with their chicken kabob. Its the best greek grilled chicken i've ever tasted. The prices are great and the portions are big."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. This place is always busy and rightly so, they have quality food. If you are in the area try it out, I promise you will be back. The place is small and sometimes it can take a while to get your food but it tastes so good its always worth it."}
{"text":"This stop seemed like a \"no-brainer\" loved by Yelpers and busy. However, the chicken in my salad was terrible. I ordered the Chicken Greek Salad. The seasoning was tasty but the chicken was so rubbery, that it had a weird crunch when I chewed, an experience I have never had. The staff couldn't be more attentive here. They delivered the food to my table after ordering at the counter. They checked on me several times. I did not want any other food from them, so did not discuss the quality of my food. The Chicken Greek Salad was $10.49."}
{"text":"We live eating the gyros here! The fries have no salt so skip them and get salad instead! I always go back for more! My daughter also loves the kid menu!"}
{"text":"How have I not written a review about this place yet? 

I come here probably twice a month, easily the best greek I've ever had. EVERYTHING I've had here is just awesome. The gyro, chicken, rice, steak, pitas... everything is just top notch. Just such a strange location for such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is great, and the food is the best in the valley. The food is home made from family receipts. The portions are large and at a good price. They are very clean, and have received an A rating on a number of occasions. They take pride in their place, and the food. They will make what you want to how you like it. As a foodie this is my go to spot. Give them a shot, and enjoy their food."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place, the cashier/server Angela is super cool, completely friendly, and all around a positive person. I have never brought a friend here that didn't just love their food. It's fresh, it taste amazing, and honestly I have never felt bloated after eating. You eat good, then you feel good. It's simple, if you wanna feel good, then you gotta eat Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"Excellent food as usual.  However, 30min wait to get my food on a Friday night while others that came after me with large orders got theirs first!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but it was busy inside. The young man at the counter was very nice and everyone was friendly. We ordered the gyro sandwich and the gyro fries. Both were delicious! Perfectly seasoned meat, the bread was soft and fresh and the sauce was to die for! First time here, and I know we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Get their homemade bread! I am not a big fan of wraps since all it usually is is a flour tortilla or something similar. But here, they do wraps with pita bread or their fresh baked bread. Definitely go for the later. It is more expensive than the pita bread but I think it's worth it - it's bigger so that's why.
I got the chicken shawarma sandwich/wrap. The bread was warm and yummy. They loaded it with TONS of chicken. Almost to the point where it was a bit too much but that only makes it a great deal for your money. It was $7.49. 
The only slight I had was that I always like dark meat over white meat. The description said it was made from chicken thighs.  When I got it, it was more like half and half.  That or half the dark meat was dry.  But that's minor since in most cases, that would be the better deal since white meat is usually more.  
Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"I had to come back here when My Big Fat Greek at Arrowhead Mall screwed up my order...I'm 9 months pregnant so when I want a Gyro Wrap, I WANT a Gyro Wrap! I got back to work to discover My Big Fat Greek had given me a CHICKEN wrap! Wasn't happy! I knew I had to go to a place where I know it wouldn't be screwed up. And they haven't disappointed me yet!
Word of advice- if you're gonna go somewhere for good Greek food, make sure you see the lamb on the spit...otherwise you're wasting your time."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for lunch, very reasonably priced, clean and has great service!!! Try it if you have not been!"}
{"text":"Nice clean place, pleasant staff. Had falafel as appetizer and the chicken kabob wrap, both delicious and served with a very tasty sauce. Total was less than $20 for 2 people. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little place to eat and though we were pretty hungry from a long day, it was great that we found this place and that my husband was opened to trying it.  There were a host of chain restaurants all around, but we wanted something different and a fresh, clean, homemade taste of food and this was the perfect place.

The place was packed, the food was absolutely delish!  We love some of the Greek places in the east valley, but the flavor of the food of Greek Wraps was awesome and very good.  

The service was excellent and each person was attentive and friendly to us as well as all their other customers.  Excellent customer service.

We ordered a plate of Steak Kabobs, which had that with a yellowish type rice, a sauce, pita, a salad, and another dressing that has garlic and I think some cumin in it.  One of the guys there said it's sort of like ranch, but I didn't think it had any semblance to ranch.  My husband, kids and I loved it and fought for the sauce.

My daughter and I ordered Gyro Wraps and there is plenty of meat in the wraps, so you'll definitely get your protein worth and a very good price at under $7 for this huge thing.  Our son ordered a Falafael Pita and he really liked it, too and that was really filling for him.

We made the mistake of ordering a side of french fries and onion rings, which really was way, way too much food for our family of four and we left there with leftovers and completely stuffed, but very satisfied.

The meats were very flavorful and not bland.  And everything tasted like it was homemade and fresh, not the chain restaurant type taste.  

We would love to come more frequently, but it's more than 50 miles from where we live, but if we happen to be coming home from Flagstaff, Prescott, Sedona or needing to do something in the NW valley, we'll stop by and grab some food to go.

Totally worth every penny and the wait for the food.  If I could give you more stars, I would.  

Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean fast food I have ever had. The pita bread is fresh and delicious, hummus is creamy and well-seasoned, the garlic sauce and tsatziki are phenomenal. The chicken kabobs are excellent and the gyro meat is even better. They also have a kid's menu with stuff to satisfy picky eaters (like corn dogs and French fries). The food is prepared fresh, comes out quickly, and the staff are very nice and helpful. All-around fantastic experience and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I Love this place, the only issue is I ate it so much that I couldn't get it for a while, finally went back today and yep - I'll probably over do it again!
You just can't go wrong with this food \"a y of it\""}
{"text":"As always the food was great!
I was asked to sample two new hummus's 
The first was the roasted red pepper cilantro.... It was amazing!!
The second was a jalapeño... Equally as good!!
They already have the best hummus in the valley, and they may add two more."}
{"text":"Been to Greek Wraps several times. Recently came here and it was so good that I came back the next day! Very good Greek food, in my opinion one of the best in town. The workers are always friendly and they have a great selection. 

I had their Gyro on their house made wrap. It was super good, but the tip here is to make sure to if you order the wrap to eat it warm at the restaurant. I've been told that the wrap may get a little soggy if you wait too long to eat.  But eating it fresh there at the restaurant was one of the best gyros I've ever had. 

I've also had their steak kebab plate with rice and hummus. It also comes with a Greek salad as well. Very tasty and good. 

Overall a great local west valley gem. I'll be back soon enough!"}
{"text":"I didn't set out to go eat at this place but I'm sure glad I ended up there. I walked in on a Saturday and the place was busy. That's a good thing right? They were very clean and seemed well organized. I waited a little longer than I would have liked but it WAS a Saturday.. They made the best chicken salad I've ever eaten.. Well worth the wait. I've tried quite a few Greek restaurants but this place is by far the best I've eaten at. The chicken I had was marinated perfectly and cooked just right, super moist!! It's right down the street from where I work so I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. You've got to try this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. 

I have been 3-4 times, ACCIDENTALLY. 

I obviously check Yelp for places to eat, and somehow I am always in Peoria/Glendale when I am in the mood for Greek/Mediterranean food. So I look for 4 star+ places and repeatedly end up here. 

The service is quick, the staff are sweet, the food is consistent, and the portions are perfect. 

I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Greeks wraps is a great place for lunch in the Arrowhead Mall area.  I always get the steak shawarma on a 7\" pita, the garlic sauce is great.  It gets very busy right at noon so you may have to get it to go.  Only about 10 table or so inside this place but the food is fantastic.  I have not had anything else here but my wife usually gets a gyro or a salad and she is always pleased as well."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros with great prices too. Been here several times and it never disappoints. The pita is light and fluffy and the meat is tender and moist."}
{"text":"Consistently good food! We enjoyed the gyro plate. Gyro meat, Greek salad, pita bread, hummus and safron rice. The portion is large. We split a gyro plate for dinner and get extra tyzeki sauce.  We have also enjoyed the fish plate and ground beef plate.  Friendly staff and excellent service"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people working, the chicken shawarma was full of flavor, juicy and the humus went well with the dressing.  I'd order it again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The best Greek food I have found in the Valley.  Everything I have had on their menu has been outstanding. But if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the gyro plate just because the food proportion is the best and you get a mix of the meat, rice, sauce and hummus.  I usually get an order of the eggplant dip to go with it as well."}
{"text":"We come here all the time as a family. My husband and I always share the combo kabob plate because it is so much food! Hands down best Greek food in town!!!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here for the first time, and I assure you, it won't be our last. The menu is incredible. We had the Feta Gyro Pita. Perfectly prepared and delicious. Included in the menu were Italian beef sandwiches, Chicago dogs, and Greek dogs. I must check them out. The staff appeared to be family,  who were very nice. The service was outstanding. The establishment was very clean and organized nicely."}
{"text":"Gyro was real good!!  I'll be back for more. The fries were soggy-ish. Not good. The salads were great. I thought the gyro needed a bit more sauce though."}
{"text":"Hands down the best in the west valley! Highly recommend the steak shawarma plate, Gyro plate, ground been kabob plate and falafel Greek salad! Servings are huge, the service is always fantastic but the seating is usually hard to get. (This is a busy place) If you don't take it to go, which we often do, you can usually secure a spot somewhere outside and the staff has been really awesome in bringing it out to us as we usually end up in the outdoor seating by Panda."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Very clean. Great chefs prepare food to perfection. Tastes like a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"My friend said he knew a great middle eastern restaurant and he was right! I had the gyro and by the advice of the guy behind he counter I had the large bc it was with the pita bread they make there and it was amazing!!!! I also bought a baklava and loved it too. The guy and girl behind the counter that found out it was my first tie were so rad about making sure I knew how happy they were that my friend brought me. They even threw in some extra of their homemade yogurt sauce which was the best I have ever had, even better than my own! I shared some hummus and the Greek salad with my friend as well and was really impressed with it all."}
{"text":"If you like greek food this will certainly satisfy your craving.  It's all about the food here, atmosphere is lacking.  Price is reasonable.  This is not a chain.  Only criticism is the wait, not fast service, but I guess you have to wait for the good stuff.  Give this place a try when you want Greek, then go next door to Juju Berry for dessert."}
{"text":"This place is super yummy and affordable. The gyro meat is super good and fresh, the tzatziki and pita appetizer was good and the wife's salad not only looked wonderful but tasted just as good. Definitely a go to Greek place in the West Valley."}
{"text":"We found it! The best Greek food in the West Valley. After moving here from the East we haven't had any luck until now. Great portions at a great price. The whole family left with happy full stomachs."}
{"text":"I really like this place, not only is the food fresh and tasty but the service is always very nice. I usually take it to go but sometimes we sit in. I love pretty much anything I have tried tho I stick to the faves or most common plates such as gyros, falafel etc. I tell others when I like a place so I have told a few and brought friends also.  Will continue to come back and try out new dishes."}
{"text":"This is by far the best gyros and shawarma plates by far. Everything is delicious here.  Even their water tastes better lol. Make sure you order the sandwiches with their homemade wraps, very tasty."}
{"text":"Quick, fabulous food.  Helpful, friendly staff!  Very busy lunch rush on weekdays. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I visited this place tonight for the first time with my hubby and we loved it! Not only does it smell amazing the second you walk in, but the staff were incredibly nice and welcoming. She went out of her way to get us things we didn't even ask for. The meat is carved off right in front of you as well as put together right there so you could watch if you wanted. It is very relaxed and homey. I got the gyro salad and it was so amazing. We also got the falafel plate to share and those were the BEST falafel I've ever had. Make sure to ask for the hot sauce if you like heat. It's awesome! We will be back many more times."}
{"text":"This place has fantastic food just wish it wasn't also so busy. You can never get a table and even take out there is always a wait. They should do more with the restaurant maybe upgrade and get a bigger location."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night after seeing the good reviews. It's great! 

I had the chicken shawarma wrap and it was super good. Fresh, yummy and huge! I probably shouldn't have eaten the whole thing, but it was so good I took it down and figured I'd just pay for it later.

The restaurant is clean. The staff were quick and friendly. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I've been coming here for a couple of years now, and I can easily say I've never had a bad experience. The staff is so friendly and the food is so delicious. They have a good menu, their pitas are amazing but I also absolutely love the Chicken Greek Salad. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I can eat here everyday. And I almost do amazing food and quality is always constantly amazing."}
{"text":"YES! Grab your nom nom face and head on over! 
Experience: I looked this place up on yelp since I knew I'd be in the area. My wife and I went in and the place was packed, no tables. We were ordering and one opened up, my wife quickly snagged it and after I sat down the guy came over and wiped it down for us. 
Food: Food took a little bit to be done but they were crazy busy, in store and phone orders. The food was amazing! I got steak shawarma and my wife got a fish wrap and baklava. I cannot wait to go back, I neeeed it.
For the record, I'd had gyros/wraps before.. first time with shawarma. I asked the guy taking orders what he recommended and went along with it. I want to explore the whole menu.

Update: I've been back so many times I cannot count anymore.. it is just great freakin' shawarma."}
{"text":"I love this place! Its my favorite place to eat! Their Chicken Kabob plates are sooooo good! I highly recommend it! You can't go wrong here with anything you order. Always alot of food on your plate and its fresh too! Employees are really friendly its like being with family and having a meal together."}
{"text":"This is 1 of our favorite spots in the valley. We order the combo kabob plate and share it! It's so much food and aLwAyS bomb. Plus, the service is incredible! We definitely recommend Greek Wraps any day of the week"}
{"text":"This place is always busy for a reason. It's honestly the best place to go if you're craving a Mediterranean meal in the Arrowhead area. Food is amazing. Employees are super polite and friendly. The place is clean. You'll never see a dirty table, because they're always quick to rush and wipe a table down when a customer leaves. Definitely try this place out of you haven't already."}
{"text":"Great food! I have been a customer for a good 7/8 years now. I always order my favorite item on the menu- chicken shwarama! It's delicious...as all of their menu is. 

Definitely a place that will satisfy your cravings for tasteful food!"}
{"text":"Yelp rarely lets me down. And I found a wonderful place right near my apartment. This is Greek at its best!

The place itself is nothing to write home about. Slightly crowded, dim, and not much seating. But it's CLEAN! That's all I really care about. The staff makes it feel like home too. Engaging others and myself in conversation while attending to tables. Really impressive staff.

Obviously if it is nothing special by looks, then it seriously delivers on substance. The hummus was good. Tasty and a decent portion. The baba ganoush is SO good. Definitely recommend at least getting the 50 cent cup of it to try it out! And the pita chicken kabob was great! Plenty of food portion wise and didn't feel overpriced at all.

Overall great place. A great alternative to chain restaurants. Excited to try other dishes here in the future!"}
{"text":"The beauty of Chicago is the huge selection of ethnic foods we get to sample.  So I was disappointed with the Greek selection Glendale has to offer

Falafel had a weird grimy taste to it.  Texture wasn't all there.  Gyros were dry.  Yogurt sauce accompanying it, bland

They tried, they failed...MISERABLY"}
{"text":"I ordered a regular pita gyro. That's the first thing I had to try. I was not surprised by how delicious this gyro was! Size portion was generous and not skimpy like other places. Every ingredient was fresh and the meat was juicy!"}
{"text":"What a great little family run Greek restaurant this is for the Arrowhead area.  I have been here several times and each time have enjoyed every bite of what I ate.  Sometimes in the suburbs it's tough to find good ethnic food.  This fills the void for the area.
It's not a fast food joint, but it doesn't take to long for your food to be prepared.  Decor is clean and not so bad.  The Greek music(I think that's what being played) adds a soothing feeling.  Prices are reasonable and service is ok.
I enjoy every time I come here and definitely feel like I'm getting a good value for what I pay for."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch and wow it was delicious! I got the chicken kabob plate, you can't go wrong what that. The pita was fresh and hot and the hummus, unlike any I've ever tasted, was amazing. It was enough to feed my mom and I...with a little left over! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is hot and delicious and the staff are always friendly.  Can't go wrong with anything on their menu. Even my picky kids like to eat here"}
{"text":"Love this place only Greek restaurant that makes fresh pitta's."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review to 4 out of 5 instead of 5 out of 5.

First off, HERE'S A TIP: Call them ~20 minutes ahead of time to call in your order... or else you will be waiting there for your food for a long while.

The food itself is 5 out of 5. Again, the gyro plate is phenomenal. It comes with generous amount of rice, hummus, gyro, side salad, pita bread, and tzatziki sauce. The steak kabob is also delicious. Every time I come here, I have to get both the gyro plate and the steak kabob because I cannot go without one or the other. 

I docked off one star because of the service. The people who work there could be a little more happy and smile more...."}
{"text":"My mom & I had lunch here.  2 small Greek salads, salad was fresh and crispy, could use a little more dressing or some on the side for a little more flavor but overall was up to par.."}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  A friend recently introduced me to Greek Wraps and I have been there twice since!  The chicken shawarma is delicious.  The spice on the chicken is unique and a delicious unexpected addition.  I definitely recommend the wrap over the pita. If you have a hankering for Greek food this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a couple of years The food is always great and fresh.
That's one thing I'm looking in food consistency.
The service is always good and the food is quick to arrive.
I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"My husband had the gyro and fries and he liked it but he thought it could be bigger. I had the chicken steak shawarma plate with rice and hummus. Wish there was less rice and more hummus but it was very good and a lot of food. I left half on the plate but if you are a big eater you will love it. Service was awesome. Place is real small so you might have to wait for a seat or take it to go. Coke products which is great!"}
{"text":"This has been a family fave for over a decade. The food is excellent, huge servings and great prices."}
{"text":"Best gyros I've had. Flavorful and not too greasy. If you get the combo plate, you have a choice of fries, rice, or salad, which is nice. Reasonable prices, good, fresh food, very friendly staff. It gets very busy, and  sometimes the wait can get a little long for your food, so if you're in a hurry, maybe the middle of the lunch hour isn't the best time to go."}
{"text":"This place is amazing ! I ordered the chicken kabob platter and i was not disappointed. Delicious chicken a lot of food and the tzatziki sauce and garlic sauce are SO GOOD !! The staff here is so friendly and helpful. It was my first time and they were happy to answer questions about the menu. It can take about 15 minutes to get the food when they're busy but it's worth it since all the food is fresh. If you get a salad with your meal they do bring that out before the main plate which can help with the wait for your meal. 
Definitely will be back ! Highly recommend !!"}
{"text":"As always great food, fresh, and incredibly  tasty! This beats pita jungle any day! The place is always clean, the people are friendly and always welcoming!"}
{"text":"I remember when they opened this place. It hid some really good food, behind a small strip mall facade. They have become popular enough to remodel and it's really nice inside. 
My wife and I started doing low carb and we come for steak kabob salads, chicken shawarma salads and a side of gyro meat. The garlic sauce is delicious. 

TL:DR food is great service is always outstanding"}
{"text":"We eat here quite frequently and the food NEVER disappoints. We came here on a very busy Friday and unfortunately, there was a delay getting our food (rice was still cooking) so we waited over 40 minutes for food, which with a toddler equates to 3 hours lol. When we brought it to their attention, they were very apologetic and accommodating. They did everything in their power to take care of us. We really appreciated the customer service. Still our favorite gyro spot. It's a must try for everyone!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Excellent falafel and shawarma and gyros. Fast service. Friendly service. Nice! We recommend it."}
{"text":"It used to be a good place to eat but today the waitress is rude, I can't see her name and I don't want to make a conversation with her, she is not smiling at all and she is giving us orders when she is putting the plates on the table, we are 7 people (family) having lunch here"}
{"text":"This was my first time in and the employees were all so nice! They gave great recommendations and were attentive the whole time. It was also VERY clean and fast. The combo meal comes with a big portion of rice and the pita is bigger then what I expected. I will be returning again when I have more than a 30 minute lunch break!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here. We loved it..nothing fancy but a great lunch spot considering it is in a strip center and Peoria/Glendale is not know for food like Central Phoenix and Scottsdale..The bread is fresh.The meat was great. Tzatziki sauce was perfect. I am definitely going back... Even if I have to drive an hour...The only thing I didn't like was the fries... The owner should have had Greek fries on the menu(SKINNY CRISPY WITH FETA)...."}
{"text":"The food is good. Portion size is BIG! Wait-time during lunch hours is kind of long. Restaurant is clean and staff is friendly enough. 
Definitely a recommendation."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places I've been to in Arizona. The food is amazing and fresh! You get plenty to fill yourself with a great price! We got two gyro plates with plenty of meat and rice, side of hummus, taziki sauce, side salad, two full size pittas, and two regular drinks for only 25 dollars. The works are friendly and very helpful. I plan on coming back frequently and recommend this place to many others."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place I've had Greek in the valley. The serving sizes are huge, the veggies are fresh, and the meat is tender. I order take out from here all the time and I have never had to wait for my food when I get there. There's been a couple occasions with a slightly rude person on the phone or I end up missing a salad or side item in my take out order. However, when the food is as good as it is everything else gets overlooked. I highly recommend giving this place a try but for the best experience I would dine-in."}
{"text":"This place has a great feel to it! You come in to order and you can see the 3 giant things of meat that they cook/cut from. 
I ordered the Gyro.. and had it for take out. The wrapped it very nicely and when I started digging in, nothing from my gryo was falling out! amazing! They have many different options and sizes for each item that you want to get. The girl who rung me up... was not so friendly at all.. so that was a MAJOR letdown for me. Customer Service is very important to me.. so definitely didn't get my tip. Sorry.. 
Other from that. The food was delicious and generous!"}
{"text":"Since our first visit to new york my fiance and I have been obsessed with finding a decent new york street style falafel sandwich here. We have learned its all about the tahina sauce, very important. And a nice crispy on the outside ball of falafel, not the grainy or soggy stuff you tend to run into here. Well after a few complete failures, I'm looking at you pita jungle, we have found what we believe to be the closest possible substitution here at greek wraps. Their falafel is spot on, crispy out side and moist inside, and they're tahina sauce is wonderfully reminiscent of that with which we would drown our sandwiches with in new york. On the downside there is always a wait to order, despite being rushed when you are at the counter."}
{"text":"The best, been going like 5 years.  So fresh, call her take out.  Chicken kabob plate, hummus, great rice.  Staff always fairly friendly.  Gets quite busy.

Def one Phx best places to get Middle Eastern style
Food."}
{"text":"Food was so good! Fresh, and definitely a healthy alternative to other places in the area. Staff is still awesome. Absolutely somewhere I would drive out of my way to come too"}
{"text":"Fantastic food everything we ordered was great!  It was fresh and wonderfully prepared....salads were crispy the feta cheese was perfect!   Wonderful service and customer service was top notch.    Going soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The steak kabob plate is the way to go! Ate here before and love coming here again. Staff is super friendly and polite. Service is great and the price for what you pay for is good."}
{"text":"Awesome place, food is fantastic. You can't go wrong with any selection. Although i favor the gyros."}
{"text":"In the Arrowhead area, there is a mass metropolis of chain restaurants with mediocre food and average service...YAWN! 

Without having to drive very far to a {non-chain} place with good, inexpensive food, time to give GREEK WRAPS another try.

 It's located in the Old Navy shopping Center on the Southeast corner...a few doors down from Panda Express. Depending when you go, parking can be a challenge.

I haven't been in here for many, many years, because last time it was just ok... (service, food, etc)...boy, it has changed!!! It's better now!

Busy place! I think I counted 8 tables in the place and many people waiting for their take-out...or a table?

Nice, inviting decor. 

Cashier was friendly. You could see the busy cooks working efficiently and concentrating on getting the orders filled. 

The menu is easy to read without being overwhelming and has pictures of the food items. The prices are VERY reasonable & inexpensive!

The gyro pitas are $4.99 and the portions are very generous. 

Fries are $1.75, which are crunchy, steak fries in a basket...not too greasy and a nice size portion for several people to share.

Chicken kabob pita is offered in four different styles...it was $5.50 and was HUGE! The chicken itself was a tad on the salty side, but still really tasty overall.

Hummus was inexpensive with delicious flavor. It comes with 2 warm and soft pitas cut into triangles. 

They do have a kid's menu too.

Order & pay at the counter, grab a table, and wait for your number to be called. I am very happy to find a new place to eat in the area. i {heart} GREEK WRAPS!"}
{"text":"Ground beef Greek salad is my fave.  Friendly service Great for a  quick bite or dine in."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, the reviews are true This place is seriously the bomb. Tried the 3 way combo plate with steak chicken and gyro and shared it with my wife. We took some home!! Great food, great staff. We will definitely be back And I have already recommended it to friends."}
{"text":"We bought a couple of party trays for my birthday and I have to say, it can feed a whole battalion. Not only was there a lot of food, it was also delicious, as usual. Thank you, Greek Wraps!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best hummus and baklava in town! Their tilapia fish platter is amazing. Always very friendly service. They do get busy sometimes on the weekends, but you can call and order your food as well!"}
{"text":"This place knocks it out of the park every time. Their chicken kabobs, fresh bread (made in house), greek salads, and gyros are all my favorite. Everything is tasty. Well deserving of 5 stars and the place is always spotless!"}
{"text":"I was deprived of good Greek or Mediterranean food for 2 years living in the Caribbean and upon this return, this place welcomed me back with open arms and tastiness. It is better than I ever remember it being and they have expanded it some so that it is some what easier to get a table, even though it is still always crowded. Besides the space, the hardest part is deciding what to actually order because everything is excellent. My favorite is the falafel wrap (but supersize it and get the wrap, not the pita, because the bread is much better)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is small, but serves like a beast! The prices are competitive. The dishes are abundant. The service is great. My whole family enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the chicken shawarma greek salad and it was to die for. The only other place I've ever had such solid mediterranean flavors was in Israel. The chicken was a tad on the dry side, but the dressing and tzatziki compensated for that. Also came with a pita (always a plus). 

Overall, GREAT greek food. If you're in the mood, this place will fill your craving and then some."}
{"text":"One of the best gyros I've ever had. Make sure to get the 10in so that you get the fresh baked pita bread!"}
{"text":"Affordable, very generous portions and always tastes amazing! This is my family's go to spot."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and LOVE IT!  It has become our \"go to\" Greek place.  The chicken Shawarma is especially good, but we have enjoyed everything!"}
{"text":"Have you ever walked into a Greek restaurant that was PACKED in Arizona? Most likely not. However, when you walk into Greek Wraps and taste their food, you'll understand why they're SO busy. 

Hands down the BEST gyro pita I've ever had in Arizona. I wish it was in more locations, since Peoria is a bit far from me. If you're ever in the area and you're craving a Gyro Pita - this is a MUST STOP!! 

The only downside of this place is- it makes all other gyro pitas inferior in comparison."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the warm pitas and hummus are awesome. Unfortunately, the chicken I had was over seasoned and the beef that my friend ordered was so over seasoned that it was inedible. I may have to try again on another day."}
{"text":"Never disappointing. Fresh, warm, and always delicious. The food is beyond excellent and never less than that! I've been a customer for a few years and the service is always great. One of the employees named Martin, never forgets to ask how my day is going and always makes \"the usual\" (steak sharwarma plate) comes out never less than perfect. My go to spot, highly recommended, love this place!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Greek food I have tried. I would have given them 5 stars but the food took a while to come out. Other than that the food was delicious and it you get a lot of food for what you paid."}
{"text":"This is easily one of my top favorites in the state. It never disappoints. The flaming feta hummus is absolutely delicious. As are the shwarma plates and pitas. Honestly, anything you order will be mouth watering and timely. Service is impeccable, they have  never gotten an order wrong in the years I've been coming here. You'll spend up to $12 a person, but you'll most likely leave with leftovers and definitely a happy tummy!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Greek food I've had in the valley. I took my sister and her husband when they came into town a year ago and it is the place they request to go every time they come to visit now. They keep trying other places only to be disappointed. 

I typically get the gyro platter which comes with a LOT of food. The side salad that is included is extremely delicious. The restaurant is small and can get busy but the staff is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Oh man this place is AWESOME!! They're food is great, customer service is phenomenal!! And prices are amazing. Best Greek food I've had yet"}
{"text":"Soooooo good. My favorite is the falafel plate. Beautifully crunchy on the outside, perfect inside. Rice is cooked perfectly. Portions are big, so bring a friend! 

Dining area is modest but modern, and immaculately clean. They have an extensive selection of drinks with a touch screen soda fountain, along with separate filtered water. 

Staff is friendly, cheerful, and totally on top of their game. Customers are greeted and given a warm goodby at their departure. Bus staff is lighting fast. No table is left dirty.

Take out is fast and easy. 

This is my new go to for great comfort food. 

What are you waiting for? Get down here!"}
{"text":"Okay this place is fantastic. I was so impressed and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I wish I lived in Arizona so I could eat this for every meal. I mean, yeah I totally would do that. 

SO I came in for lunch, it was pretty busy, but the line moved quickly. I ordered a salad, and being the indecisive person that I am, couldn't decided between the chicken and gyro meat. So I got both! And that was probably the best choice I made. 

The workers were so friendly and nice and the service was great. The food came out quick, and holy the servings were HUGE. I was so impressed! Normally places try to skimp you on the amount of protein they give you, but man they loaded it on. And it was all so delicious!! I actually liked both the chicken and gyro a ton. I also was impressed that it was a quality salad. 

Overall, I just think that the prices are reasonable, they give you a good amount of food, and they are super friendly. Delicious Mediterranean!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. Bikram Yoga Peoria recommended it and I don't ever want to eat at another Greek place. The gyro salad is my favorite, The pita bread is perfect and the staff is great."}
{"text":"We stopped at the Greek wraps to get gyros! They were already closed and they served us anyways! Greek Wraps were very friendly, polite and I will be a patron of this restaurant as long as I live in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I tried the gyro. It was delicious. The food seems better than the othe Greek places I've been to."}
{"text":"Had a gyro sandwich with fries and it was amazing! I've never had Greek food so me and a friend decided to check what's on yelp. We saw that Greek Wraps had some good reviews. The peta bread was soft and tender, the lamb with Greek yogurt sauce was tangy and flavorful, and the lettuce and tomato added that fresh crunch! Super friendly staff and great atmosphere definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place!  Best gyro ever!  Super clean, fresh, delicious, a little slow but that's ok. I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. I get the Philly Steak and it's amazing. The garlic sauce is the best. We are here at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in wanting a Greek chicken salad and this place did not disappoint. Some of the best grilled chicken I've eaten! Comes with pita bread and white dill sauce. I wonder if they have greek fries here?"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with this: I AM NOT GREEK.  However, I have tried a lot of Greek food in Phoenix, and this is by far the best cheap Greek eatery that I have experienced.  From the friendly service to the smell as you walk in, this place doesn't disappoint.

I usually do the Gyro platter, but sometimes I'll do some Falafel and the Chick Shawarma.  Everything I have tried is delicious and the service is always fast and friendly.  It can be a bit crowded in here around lunch, but that just means this place is doing something right!  If you like to avoid crowds, you can take it to-go or eat outside where there are a few tables.  There is places in the same shopping center to grab dessert or a coffee or just shop.

As far as low-priced, quick Greek food, this place is my go-to and I hope you will love it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"Yelpers are right on again! Greek Wraps is da bomb.

Had to take my car in for service today and on the way back to pick it up the husband and I decided to try something new. As usual I sought the advice of yelp since I'm not familiar with the Peoria area.

We decided on Greek Wraps and based on past reviews I knew what I was going to have before I got there, the Steak Shawarma, he got the Gyros Plate. Both came with a Greek Salad, Hummus, Rice and a Pita. Lots of food, but we were hungry.

The salad could have had a little more flavor, but the rest of the meal was great. Now we'll have to find a reason to go back to Peoria so we can dine here again."}
{"text":"Greet Wraps is INCREDIBLE!! Service is excellent!!! Make sure you get there early for lunch because it gets busy and it does take a little while to get your food.  But it it SO worth the wait.  The chicken Kebob on a pita with lemon sauce is the BEST thing I've ever eaten!!"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch. It's easy to be overwhelmed by all of the dining choices near Arrowhead. The Greek Wraps is a no-brainer.

Clean and upscale convenient dining, very pleasant and accommodating staff, and the best Gyro on the West-Side...

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Totally underestimated food- everything I've tried has been great. You cannot beat the value. If you went across the street to Pita Jungle to have a very similar meal, you'd pay about 20% more per order.

There's an open kitchen and everything is made fresh right in plain sight. Their food is always well seasoned and it's pretty healthy for a fast-casual place. Order yourself some Falafel while you await your salad or entree and ask for extra dipping sauce for it.

They do close at 8, the CFL lighting is not at all cozy and it gets really busy for dinner, however the food and service are so good that I don't mind. Greek Wraps feels like a family business and they really seem to care that you're having a good meal and that you'll come back for more."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good Mediterranean spot? This was one of my favorite go to spots for a chicken kabob plate or simply just a gyro!! It's a nice little spot, parking can be a little tight around here & the wait can tend to be a little while depending on what you order. But the food is worth it.

They put just the right amount to tzatziki sauce on their gyros. & the gyros are also so packed with meat!  Its so packed with meat that I usually have to pick some of it off before I can take an actual bite haha. Not too salty or oily like other places are either. Their fried are thick cut, fried to the perfect crisp. I LOVE their chicken kabob plate though. Their chicken is so flavorful. I usually sub the rice for fries. & their hummus is good as well. 

I recommend that if your are simply placing an order to go for one of the kabob plates, call and order ahead of time because the wait is usually about 15-20 mins long."}
{"text":"It is very very hard to screw up Greek food. True, some is better than others but a lot of it follows (or should follow) recipes that have been around since Aristotle.

Up until I actual started eating my food I was a fan. I liked the vibe, I liked the menu choices, I liked the positive reviews that brought me in and I liked that they were packed at almost 7 PM on a sweltering August evening when that part of town is pretty much shut down already.

I ordered the Steak Shawarma 10\" wrap at $8.99.  By the way their online menu shows it at $7.99. As much effort as they put into social media I don't believe they \"forgot\" to update the price by a buck at their website. Tacky.

Take a look at the photo of MY sandwich compared to their highly retouched professionally photographed version of the same sandwich. They are not even on the same planet as far as what the sandwich looks like.

The kiss of death however was that the pita bread it was served in was uncooked inside, that's right it was actually raw dough that looked and felt like those Pillsbury dinner rolls in the refrigerated tube you get at the grocery store ... before you cook them. It was 100% uneatable.  I imagine their reason is that the place was swamped 15 minutes before closing on a Sunday night and they didn't have time to fully cook the pitas before serving them.  But in business a reason shouldn't be an excuse; they should have been professional and grown-up enough to come over and tell me that they were closing and all wanted to go home and didn't have time to fully cook the bread and suggest I order something else. Because they didn't they dropped their rating down from 4 or 5 stars to 1 star.  That's a sad way to lose business.

Other than that the place looked reasonably clean.  The service was what you might expect from a bunch of young guys who are 15 minutes from getting off work on a weekend and have a lot more on their minds than having to deal with last-minute customers. In other words the service wasn't very good.  While my order was being prepared I watched the guys in the kitchen. It was sort of like watching food being prepped at a McDonalds if you know what I mean.

This place has huge potential and with a good manager could be a very good place to find Greek food. But my first impression is that they just don't care.

[EDIT] It's now a month later. My final comment on this place is I believe they just don't care. Any reputable business that served raw food to a customer would be all over themselves apologizing. These people didn't even bother to post a comment saying \"sorry\". Since then I found another place \"Gyro Point\" on Peoria Ave that is night & day better than this place. I suggest you try them."}
{"text":"Greek Wraps; You never cease to amaze me. 

I practically lived at this place when i lived closer. But every excuse i can get I travel from Scottsdale to get this amazing food!! Every meat they have is moist and cooked to perfection while BOOMING with flavor. The portions are big but satisfies your every craving. Make sure to order a \"fresh bread\" on the side for a dollar extra. You wont be disappointed.

:)"}
{"text":"Best greek place I've been too in the North Valley. They make all of their breads fresh. The chicken and steak is well marinated. Sometimes the Chicken can be a little dry. Overall, it's a great lunch spot."}
{"text":"We've been to this place 5-6 times and have NEVER been disappointed. The food is very fresh and seems to be of excellent quality. The staff has always been attentive, pleasant and helpful. It's clean and the employees are diligent about clearing tables as they become available.   The food takes a bit to come out BUT I am TOTALLY ok with that because I'd rather wait for great food than have \"ok\" food faster.  
The only reason I didn't give it five stars..... 
It gets warm in there during the warmer months. Perhaps it's an attempt to reduce costs. The only suggestion I'd make is to recognize our hot months and keep the dining room more comfortable.  They are so accommodating and approachable but sometimes the dining room makes us wish we ordered it \"to go\". 
Still LOVE IT and will keep going back!"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place is rated the way it is. Quite frankly, its elite. Ive been eating here for a long time... Its one of the best places in town. Usually about 15-20 minutes to order and can be tough to find a place to sit, so recommend taking it to go. You can sub out rice for fries if you want, their fries are awesome. Make sure to ask for the house hot sauce. Its amazing!"}
{"text":"I ordered a gyro plate (gyro meat, rice, pots bread, hummus and a side salad) to go. 

Delicious is about right. Good is an understatement. If you like Mediterranean style food then this is the place to go. Enough said."}
{"text":"It's a good thing that this place is not closer to where I live or I would weigh 400 pounds."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their salads are huge, bursting with flavor and the employees are always nice. Best place on the West side for Greek."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times with 3 different groups of people over the past month or so and each time has been a pleasure for everyone. I am vegetarian, my daughter vegan and everyone else I have been here with eats whatever and this place has met all of our dietary needs perfectly... and with a smile to boot! 

I enjoy the vegetarian appetizer platter as a meal, which comes with the best falafel I have had in any restaurant. My daughter orders the falafel salad and my husband enjoys the falafel wrap. We know our falafel! They also have excellent dolmas, tabouli, hummus & baba ganoush, 

Nice little place with both indoor and outdoor seating. After your order they bring your food to you, whether your inside or out. It's clean and service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried so many Greek/middle eastern food in Phoenix, nothing tops this place. Food is delicious and full of flavor. The employees are all so friendly we love coming back"}
{"text":"The steaks kabobs are the best i have ever had. Place is clean with great service. This place does get busy so its best to call the order in."}
{"text":"Pretty good stuff! We got two plates - a chicken shawarma and a gyros plate. Next time, I would probably just get the gyro sandwich.  The chicken shawarma had a great flavor and the hummus was excellent. I didn't really care for the rice and thought it was a bit dry. The customer service was great!"}
{"text":"Greek Wraps makes me happy because it's delish gyro only minutes from home. Their gyro pita is very filling. Lots of well seasoned meat. Not dry. Pita is fluffy. Everything comes out hot. It's a small establishment and the service can be slow when it's busy, but the food makes up for it. I once got the falafel and hummus plate. I've been wanting to order it again, but I'm usually craving meat when I go. Hummus serving was huge. It lasted me 3 meals. I never had falafel before so I'm not expert but it tasted good to me. Ate everything within two days. I'll be going back to GW for more Greek food cravings."}
{"text":"I should have written this review years ago!! This was my go to when I lived in Glendale. Now I live in Cali and not a day goes by that I don't think about Greek Wraps and it's amazing garlic sauce *cries*. I compare ever greek restaurant I eat at to Greek Wraps and NOTHING compares. One day I will be reunited with it and it will be magical!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of their pita.  It was so fresh and warm.  Excellent!  I prefer the hummus at Pita Jungle though."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend the gyros plate. Comes with a small greek salad that always tastes freshly made. For $10, you get one pita, a scoop of hummus, yellow rice, and of course a good amount of gyros with tzatziki sauce. It's quite a lot of food and could probably feed two people/split into two meals. The rice is delicious and the gyros are nicely seasoned. The employees are also really nice. The restaurant itself is medium sized, though it's usually pretty packed whenever I've gone, especially at dinner and even near closing time.

Took off a star because once I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and unfortunately the chicken was pretty dry."}
{"text":"Not Great. Rice undercooked. Steak Bland. Gyro overly salty (consistently) - which is something because I like salt."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times.  I go out of my way to eat there.  Staff is wonderful.  Food is consistently wonderful.  Great food.  Great service.  Reasonable price.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"#1 - MUST have their garlic dipping sauce...so good!

I like that they have really cheap appetizers...I ordered all the $1.00 ones. I figured I might as well try them since they're cheap and see if I like them. I liked the Falafel, Spanakopita, and their bread (so good). 

The food is pretty good and the portion is perfect (okay, maybe it's just a tad bit more than enough). 

The workers are super friendly!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and delicious.  I mostly stick with the humus and grilled tilapia. They are both outstanding.  What more can I say? Greek Wraps is my favorite joint in town."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Greek food so this place was pretty much an Oasis for my family and me. We've been going to this place for about three to four years now and the quality of food has stayed consistent along with the amazing customer service. The place is small and gets very busy especially during lunch and dinner so finding a seat can be difficult. There is seating outside which is better for the cooler months in Arizona or summer nights once the sun has went down. 

I've ordered a variety off the menu but my favorite would have to be the Gyro Wrap. The pita bread is good, but the wrap is made with the house bread which is baked fresh every day. The gyro meat can be seen being sliced in the kitchen which I think is cool. The tzatziki sauce is awesome and I would definitely recommend order an extra side of sauce for your meal. It costs $0.50 but totally worth it in my opinion. The Chicken Wrap is just as good in my opinion. The meat is always well seasoned and juicy. This is a good option for someone who is new to Greek food and may not be a fan of very strong flavors like the typical gyro meat contains. 

Recently I tried the Ground Beef Kabob Plate which comes with hummus and three pieces of beef kabob on a bed of rice. The hummus is great, and I'm actually not a big fan of hummus in general. The rice is okay. There isn't too much flavor to it, but it's definitely not bad. The first time I tried this plate I must have had a fluke because the kabob was unfortunately tried out, but I could tell there was flavor. I gave the beef kabob another chance but this time in a Ground Beef Wrap and it was to die for. Might be my new favorite thing! The meat was more flavorful than I remember and super juicy. 

I've only tried their baklava once but it was delicious and cheap. I could have had five of those things. 

All in all, I love this place. I miss it whenever I go away for college and demand at least one meal there when I visit the family. The customer service is consistently phenomenal and have yet had a bad experience with the employees."}
{"text":"great food, good service and prices are reasonable. they have a good variety menu would certainly eat there again."}
{"text":"Baba Ganoush and Dolmas are yummy. 

GET THE GROUND BEEF KABOB SANDWICH. Its not on the menu but you can request it. It's delicious and so filling, I prefer the pita over the wrap for choice of bread but its whatever you like."}
{"text":"This place has good food but the menu yes it has pictures and stuff but the name of the food is written on the board so small I can't even read it and  I have good eyes! Besides that, everything is fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite quick lunch spots in the northwest valley.  The portions are huge, the prices are totally affordable, the staff is always friendly, and if you order one of the wraps, they fire/cook the bread right there in front of your eyes!  And it's delicious by the way!  Definitely try one of the wraps if you stop in but beware...you might need a wheelbarrow to cart yourself out!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Must try the steak kabob plate and if u like chicken as well. Get the combo plate! Very filling so no need to order any extra."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that I didn't have to spend a lot to get good food. This place fulfilled that need. Although it is the first time I did have Greek food I can say that it was really good food. Just a standard place that serves good food."}
{"text":"Decent gyros but I felt like it took too long to get one during lunch. I'll be back during dinner and try that next time. Place is tiny so don't expect to find a table at lunch. It's packed in there."}
{"text":"I made a tough decision today. It was either get Juju Berry fro-yo, or buy a gyro from this fine establishment. Obviously, my choice was the gyro, I'll save fro-yo for when I'm only partially hungry. Otherwise, if I do choose fro-yo when I'm starving, its like a 12 buck fro-yo...just not a good look. But I digress.

Of the many times I have visited, I've only ordered the gyro from here. But every time I do, I make a sloppy but delicious mess of that gyro and myself. I like it here, have yet to dine in, its clean but there isn't really much to look at or any form of an entertainment factor here. Some places just have character, and I tend to not take out from them. So yes, minus the star on the rating for capturing my dinning and entertainment combo requirement. But its still a really good and affordable gyro!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mediterranean food I've had in Phoenix.  In a strip mall off 73rd Ave. Expect it to be busy and for your food to take about 10 minutes to arrive.  Portions are huge...the meat is flame grilled and juicy, pita's are are fresh, salads are wonderful.  Love this little place."}
{"text":"This is one of my two top dining destinations in the Arrowhead area.  My husband and I make a trip across town at least once a week to indulge in the fresh, healthy menu options.  I have tried several menu items but always lean toward the Lemon Chicken Pita meal-with tender white meat chicken grilled to perfection-juicy and an ample portion.  The servers anticipate our order-which is a nice welcome-in the often impersonal restaurant world.  The food is cooked to order-so sit tight-but it is well worth the wait.  It is a family run business-and all of the employees are personable-and have been there as long as we have been patrons-which speaks to a well run business.  It is always clean and well organized-even when it is busy with customers."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mediterranean Greek places when I am in the Arrowhead Peoria area I love the fresh bread I love the chicken kebab salads I love the steak kebab salads and I love the homemade green hot sauce. I wish their garlic sauce was a little bit more garlic  flavor and less mint flavor. And I love the staff very nice and friendly people."}
{"text":"This place and king gyros are my two go to. I switch off when I'm burnt out of the other lol. All their food is amazing, and Josh has some untouchable customer service skills and is very personable. Go there when you need the greek good fix"}
{"text":"The best, I repeat, THE BEST Greek Chicken Caesar Salad on the planet, bar none. I've eaten at this establishment dozens of time over the last decade and it never ceases to amaze me how good the food is here. Best part of it all is that the service staff just as good. Wait time for the food runs a bit long but it's worth every second of the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Very authentic food with delicious sauce. Welcomed when I walked by a very professional staff the explained the menu to me in detail. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably great restaurant!  I'm from Chicago & this is the best  Greek restaurant I've been to in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Phoenix!! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The whole staff is friendly and the interior is always clean."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Greek place. The food is always fresh, delicious and made to order. I have tried chicken shawarma other places and no one compares to Greek Wraps, they are the best. They have a real good variety, from pitas to salads to meals... They do get pretty busy so bring your patience during the lunch rush. They do have a few outside tables also for when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I accidentally went here instead of Greek Raps, which was the place I initially had in mind. So instead of listening to Aristotle drop lines to a sick beat, I was treated to a pleasantly tasteful and authentic meal that Caesar himself would have been proud of. I will soon return to this establishment for another helping of chicken schwarma, the taste of which would have enlightened the minds of even Socrates and Plato."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch and takeout for dinner. They always have very fresh food and great prices too. They work hard to fill your order promptly."}
{"text":"I'm always a fan of local, hole in the wall restaurants that reflect the community while offering tasty high value food. Greek Wraps wins on all counts. I'm particularly partial to their plates full of lots of yummy items--this restaurant is vegetarian friendly. I loved my gyro this evening---which at $7 and change including fries and a soda is a good value."}
{"text":"My fav! Everything I have tried has rocked! Very crowded the past few times I have gone and they chug extra for everything even simple things like a little extra taziki sauce. Very good though and worth the crowd"}
{"text":"Can't get any better than this. We are moving to the other side of Phoenix and we will so miss this place. You can't go wrong with anything you order. My mouth waters just thinking about it. And if you leave out the feta its Whole30 compliant!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating here, my dad introduced it to us as kids and we all fell in love with it! To this day my husband & I still come here, I've never had a bad meal or experience. The staff is always SO friendly and helpful. The food is always fresh and delicious. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"this has been one the places i crave for in the two years that i have spent in Glendale...
I love the chicken schwarma.... although i agree with Nadia on the fact that it does get a little drippy over the end. 
but overall really good food, quick service, and not expensive... 
for that cost, its healthy food that fills you up...
Go for Greek Wraps, and trust me you wont regret it...."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick meal with generous portions! I tried the chicken kabob plate which came with chicken kabob (shocking, I know), rice, hummus, salad, tzatziki sauce, and bread. I enjoyed all of it and was able to bring some home to enjoy later. I did feel that the rice was a little dry so I ate it with the hummus to moisten it up at bit. Besides that, everything was tasty. I also admired the great service."}
{"text":"The place is small and busy beyond belief at 1:30pm, which was a good sign! The staff is exceptionally friendly; Came in with my daughter who is in a wheelchair and they helped me find a seat, which never happens unfortunately. 

The sandwiches are nice sized and very tasty. This was the best tasting gyros I've had since leaving Chicago. And the staff was amazing. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I tried this place this weekend at the suggestion of friends who live nearby. The place is very clean and had an open kitchen, which is always a plus in my book.  The service was very good and we got our food quickly.

They are grilling some great looking beef and chicken here, yet sadly I didn't see any lamb on the menu.  I had the tri-tip kebab sandwich and my wife had the gyro.  Both were very tasty but what really made the meal was the 10'' pitas they are making from scratch.  They have a 6\" pita that appears to be sourced from Kronos (the large Greek food supply company, not the young Titan and son of Ouranos and Gaea) but the 10\" pita is homemade and ridiculously good. It has more in common with a buttery roti than a pita. Big-ups to my friend Emir for cluing me in on them.  We also had the Flaming Feta, it was fantastic, we'll definitely be getting it again.  If you like heat, be sure to ask them for their Greek hot sauce, it was a very spicy green sauce that had a unique flavor that I really enjoyed.  The only downside to the meal was the quality of the veggies in the sandwiches.  The tomatoes were pale and mealy and the lettuce was a little wilted.

I'll be returning to Greek Wraps, the 10\" pita is something I'll be craving until I have another crack at it.  There were also several other dishes on the menu that looked to have a lot of potential.  If you're in the area stop in and get some very good Greek grub."}
{"text":"Seinfeld fans may remember the \"soup Nazi\", and this restaurant sometimes reminds me of that episode.  You have to endure a business location that is far, far too small for the amount of traffic that goes through there, the food can take a long time, and it is often inconsistent but sometimes amazingly good.

Their \"wraps\" are really just handmade pita that is more like Indian Naan bread used as pita, and it is quite good, especially with falafel."}
{"text":"me and my wife been looking for a top quality mediterranean food place and finally found it!
chicken is so soft and juicy grilled to perfection hummus and salad is amazing and price is perfect cant complain one bit."}
{"text":"After moving to Glendale for medical school last year, Greek Wraps has been one of the few restaurants I visit on an almost weekly basis. The gyros here are the best in town, and it's all HALAL which is an amazing plus for any fellow Muslim brothers or sisters. I went there today and ordered a steak kabob sandwich, venturing outside my usual 10 inch gyro wrap. I didn't realize the steak kabob had hummus on it and started having a slight allergic reaction (allergic to sesame, from what I tasted though and for what it's worth, it was a great sandwich with good cuts of steak). I told one of the servers and they immediately swapped out my sandwich with something else without hummus; they were apologetic and did it ASAP with no questions asked. 

Great service, great food. I strongly suggest everyone checks this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is absolutely delicious, healthy and fresh. Prices are reasonable and they give you a lot of food for the price you pay. The staff are very nice and pleasant. If they mess up your order, they will own up to it and make it right. I eat here about 3-4 times a week. My fav dishes are the ground beef plate, Greek salad and falafel. They use fresh feta cheese and make their own hummus. They are very busy because they're so so good so I'd recommend calling in your order so you can just come pick up and leave."}
{"text":"First time here. I had a gyro wrap and fries.  The food was great and the service was even better. This place is definitely on the shortlist for me."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. The customers are rude... Super super rude. Take out dont dine in its always busy... Online menu thegreekwraps.com"}
{"text":"Many years ago I was introduced to Mediterranean food by a coworker and have been craving chicken schwarma ever since. Unfortunately the place I used to go to went out of business and I started looking for another place that offered it. I found The Greek Wraps years ago and tried their schwarma wrap sandwich. I was not impressed. Perhaps there's a difference between a Greek and Lebanese recipe it I didn't care for it and I didn't go back.

A couple of years ago my wife and I went to a Lebanese restaurant in Arlington, VA and they had amazing chicken schwarma. This made us want to find a restaurant near home that offers this dish.

The Greek Wraps is in a strip mall next to a Panda Express and a Jamba Juice and my wife asked if I knew anything about this place and I told her I had been there a long time ago and didn't like it. But she wanted to try it so we went and gave it a shot. Knowing the schwarma wasn't all that good I tried the chicken kabob plate. Wow! This dish is amazing, so full of flavor and it made up for the bad experience I had years ago.

When I find a dish at a restaurant I love, I don't usually try anything else. I did try the chicken kabob as a sandwich and while the flavor was the same, it was really messy, which was also the problem when I first ate here. Stick with the plate...if you think a sandwich will be easier to eat, you will be mistaken.

This is one dish I feel like I could eat unlimited quantities of. However, one entree is actually enough to feed both myself and my wife. The chicken kabob comes with yellow rice, hummus and pita bread, salad and a garlic sauce. It is a very satisfying meal and considering the amount of food you get it's a bargain. I have no desire to try anything else here because this is one of my favorite meals.

I do need to add that my wife hasn't been particularly happy with the quality of the chicken the last few times we've had this so am giving 4 stars instead of 5. I have no complaints however."}
{"text":"I would give them more than 5 stars if it was an option. Great, fast service in a clean restaurant serving delicious food. They give a student discount with ID (not much but every bit helps). Steak shwarma wrap is my personal fav."}
{"text":"My taste buds thank you !!!  So happy to have found a place that compares to the gyros from our \"dirt mall\" swap mart back in Ohio.  The 7\" gyro is packed with meat, fries are always fresh (enough for 2 people). They are very busy at lunch time, but worth the wait. Sooooo good!!!!"}
{"text":"We go here often but not as often as we used to. Just need to mix it up a bit. 
We have always got exceptionally good food and service. 
For Greek food, wraps, plates this is the place we aways go. 
If you go during the lunch hour be prepared to wait on a table. There is outside seating but when the weather is cool, but some people do sit out side in the cool weather and hot weather. I like to get a table inside. The trick is to get there just before the lunch rush or just after the rush. 
We usually get a meal with a large wrap and fries. We have them cut the wrap in half. This is plenty for two people.
If you are in the area go see them. We have always been happy we stoppen in."}
{"text":"Everything I have had at Greek Wraps is good. My personal favorite is the chicken shwarma with rice. The restaurant itself is clean and well lit and the staff are friendly. We do eat here but prefer to take food home because it can be somewhat packed in here."}
{"text":"We love this place so much we go once a week and had them cater our wedding reception/party!!

Everyone knows it's good, so it's usually pretty busy, but they work fast and it's worth the wait. I've had most everything on the menu and I can't say enough good stuff about it. They do something different to the gyro meat that makes it so much better. The pita bread is fresh and awesome and the hummus is just as good. 

The portions are large as well, my wife and I can split the supreme kabob plate and be plenty full when we leave. My 4 year old daughter even loves this place, and she doesn't eat from the kids menu."}
{"text":"A solid Greek restaurant on the west side. Expect a line during lunch hours and don't be surprised if the seating area is full, but don't worry the wait is never that long. The staff is very friendly and helpful if you have any questions about the menu. A variety of menu options and it's all good, don't forget the baklava."}
