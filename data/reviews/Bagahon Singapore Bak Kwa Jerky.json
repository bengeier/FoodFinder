{"text":"A Singapore style food stall in P-mall!  How happy this makes me.  They have Kaya toast, but it is a little lackluster.  Same could be said about the Laksa which they have just started to offer.  Roti Prata is really delicious except the curry that comes with it is very simple, but the bread is spot-on.   The service is a little slow, but it is worth it to get some of what they offer which is quite hard to find in Toronto.  :/"}
{"text":"An okay place to get a quick fix on Singaporean street food.  Breakfast items served all day long.  


Teh Tarik (pulled tea) is nice and foamy.  They also serve Kopi (coffee) but I haven't tried yet.  

Roti prata is just okay, better than what I can make from a frozen package, but not as flaky or fluffy as the good ones should taste.  Since I didn't see anyone flipping and stretching the dough, perhaps it's also from a frozen package?

Oyster Omelette is sadly underwhelming.  Too little and too small pieces of oysters, so the eggs and the sweet potato starch goo taste pretty bland.  They also leave the omelette in one piece like a pancake, instead of chopping it up in the last stage of cooking so each piece gets beautifully charred and well coated in seasoning.  The search continues for a good oyster omelette."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.....I'm not an expert with Hainanese Chicken rice but I really liked the one they served here.

Chicken pieces could be bigger, but it is much tastier than what I had at some other Chinese restaurant. The rice was also quite tasty and it was especially good with the spicy sauce that you get when you tell them you want 'spicy', which I mixed into the rice. Maybe it's just MSG, I'm not sure, but the complimentary soup was good the guy (owner?) says free refill for that.  His service was friendly.

I'm not at all familiar with Singapore/Malay foods and this is the only dish I know of really. I may come back and try the other stuff they got some day.

Only down part to eat here is the lack of seating in this food court area."}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with Singaporean/Malaysian food so when I found myself in the Asian food Mecca that is the Pacific Mall food court I naturally gravitated towards this place to begin my Singaporean food education. 

This place has a few items on their menu as well as a small selection of house made sausages and jerky. I was in need of a proper meal, being a fan of spice I opted for the Laksa (6.20 plus tax). After checking in on my yelp app I discovered that they have a check in offer of 3 mini sausages with any purchase over $6.20. I showed the offer to the young man behind the counter, after a confused look he took my phone to the kitchen, returned shortly and placed the 3 mini sausages in a cup for me. Free food makes me happy :-).  

The laksa came in a decent sized bowl filled with noodles, shrimp, crab, fried tofu, fish balls and mini scallops. This was a fairly generous portion for the $6.20 price tag. The broth was very creamy from the coconut milk but not too heavy, it had a bit of a kick but was not spicy enough for me, luckily there was a delicious hot sauce served on the side that provided some extra heat. My only complaint with the broth was that is was a little bit too oily. The seafood all tasted like it was frozen, the noodles were probably pre made and the fried tofu was nice especially since it soaked up some of the broth. There was some veggies in the soup as well which provided a nice crunch factor. Overall for $7 tax in I cannot really complain about this dish, it provided a quick and decent lunch. The mini sausages were actually quite good, the skin had a nice snap to it and they were a little bit sweet and spicy, I enjoyed the contrasting flavours. They usually charge $2 for 3 sausages which is well worth it if you find yourself wanting a snack. My meal also came with a cup of limewater which was a refreshing way to cleanse my pallet. Next time I will try their selection of jerky and maybe venture in to the world of Hainanese chicken rice (as per David L's recommendation)."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today.  I ordered Laksa noodle and got 3 free red sausages by checking in.  I agree with everything Sami E has written, with the exception that the soup is spicy enough for me.  I suppose the degree of spiciness is a personal thing. 

I also love the sausages.  They taste a balance of sweetness and saltiness.  I got them for free this time.  I'd love to introduce them to my friends; they are so good."}
{"text":"I used to come here frequently as this is my favourite place for Singapore Chicken Rice and Roti Prata.  Besides Singapore/Malaysian food, they also have beef/pork jerky and healthy fruit drinks.  Located inside Pacific Mall, upper level.

Today however I was disappointed with my order of Hainan Chicken Leg Rice ($6.99) as the meat and rice was very hard.  Maybe it was left over from yesterday.

I also remember ordering Laksa Noodles when they added it to the menu a few years ago.  I was expecting to enjoy it but rather it was very bland with the noodles absorbing the soup too quickly.  It was difficult to eat and I ended up throwing most of it away.  I do not know if they improved it later on as the reviews here for the Laksa seem rather good.

Due to the inconsistency I would have to give this a 2 star rating.  The staff is otherwise friendly and they have a nice selection of Singapore/Malaysian food."}
{"text":"Seeking Hainan Chicken Rice.................

I came here after doing a search online for Singaporean restaurants because I was craving Singaporean hainan chicken rice. I remember eating it while I was in Asia and it as just so yummy. But anyways, I'm sad to say this was disappointing. I got the special for under $5. It came with soup, some slices of leg meat and wing meat and rice, with minced garlic. The minced garlic might have been the best part. Anything with garlic tastes so much better. Otherwise, this is just a plate of blandness. I don't know, maybe there's a difference between Asian 4 star restaurant version and Canadian imported food court version but either way, I prefer the 4 star version. Unless someone can find me a better place serving up Singaporean Hainan chicken rice, I'll have to wait until my next trip to Asia.

Hmmm but I really do want to try their jerky. It looked really good in those glass jars. Will have to update after I get my hands on some of those :D"}
{"text":"Bagahon is located inside the food court of Pacific Mall Heritage Town. 

Aside from offering Singapore meat jerky snack, Bagahon also offers \"All Day Breakfast\" which really means toast with different spreads: Honey, Condensed Milk, Butter, Kaya. In the breakfast category also includes Congee and Instant Noodle... 

The sign saying Authentic Singapore Dishes really caught my eyes. Hainan Chicken, Curry Chicken, Fried Vermicelli and Bat Kut Teh which all reasonable priced... 

Hainan Chicken Leg Combo ($6.49) comes with soup and chicken broth rice was A-OK. I still don't understand why the leg would cost more than the breast, but I would have order the leg regardless since it is more tender than the breast. 

The rice was well flavoured with the chicken stock and oil... and it was quite filling too. The dark soy sauce is caramelized and is thick and sweet. I love the chilli/garlic sauce which is thick and spicy too! 

To rounded off my Singapore experience, I finished off with a Milk Tea ($1.99) ... which already sweetened and was smooth and silky."}
{"text":"I am now officially addicted to the Hainanese Chicken Rice here!
The best part is the rice which is very moist and tasty.
The chilli/garlic sauce is awesome as well and I ask for a larger amount right away.
The counter girl is a little thrifty with the amount she gives initially..... but she knows me by now! LOL!

I also found that you can order larger portions, ie leg or breast  so disregard my first review where I mentioned that the portion size was small.

This place ties with Lion City Rest in Mississauga for having the best Hainanese Chicken rice in the GTA IMHO."}
