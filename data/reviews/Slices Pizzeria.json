{"text":"Good eats fast take out or there's a little area you eat at. Fast service great pizza slices & cheesy bread."}
{"text":"For $3/slice, it's not bad. Given the price and the location (in Boulder Station casino), you might want to scale back your expectations, but it's pretty solid for grabbing something unhealthy if you're already here. Cheese tastes real, choice of toppings available.   Prepare yourself, though- the pizza is kept heated by lamps, and they don't toss it in an oven to heat up before serving as at other places. They simply plate it from the display. At least prices are good though- if a slice isn't enough carbs for you, add on garlic knots, 3/$1."}
{"text":"You got to be kindling would not eat that pizza for free, at 1030 single slices were trash"}
{"text":"I eat here regularly as I work nearby.  The pizza is great, as good as I've found in Las Vegas.  They actually use real sausage, not the pre-cooked flavorless stuff a lot of places use.  Price is decent, about $4 to $5 a slice depending on toppings and the slices are huge.  They also have meal deals that include cheese sticks or garlic knots and a drink.  And the staff is always friendly.  If you want a slice or a whole pie, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I will say this man Myc was amazing and funny and best of all has amazing customer service"}
{"text":"Not sure what is up with the previous two reviews.  Bad service is one thing.  The pizza on the other hand imo is great, like someone said in a previous post, this is the site of a former metro pizza, and it seems they tried to create their own version, which  is NYC pizza, and I think they did a very god job, the pizza was better the metro's.. which is saying a bit.  I did however go there when they first opened, so things may have changed.  I will go again very soon and make an update. 4.2 stars"}
{"text":"It was a one man show with MYK the only one working there. He was baking up the pizzas, heating the wings, cleaning the area, answering phone calls, ringing up the cashier, and giving the best attitude to customers as much as he can. That guy was literally a one man show and I applaud him for giving me a good outlook on this business. The casino in which this restaurant is in, surprisingly also had very friendly workers like the movie theater employees were really friendly and welcoming. MYK was incredibly awesome and had such a positive attitude even when he was ridiculously busy. Food was eh to me. The medium hot wings were kinda too salty. I appreciated the fresh out the oven pizzas they had though."}
{"text":"Located In Texas Station Hotel And Casino. Decent NY Pizza in the heart of Las Vegas? Impossible you say? Well, you would be wrong. OK so it's not exactly NY Pizza, but it's about as close as you will get this side of The Mississippi. So if you find yourself in North Las Vegas, run for cover, just kidding. Stop in and give them a try. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"The old brod had gave us some nasty attitude to the point were I got on my phone to create a yelp account to write this review!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Burnt my sandwich, said she would remake it and i said I would wait. 10 more minutes goes by and she said she didn't start making it yet. I asked for refund and she offered me a slice of pizza. Only one girl at lunch. Ridiculous wait time after burning my food. Never go again"}
{"text":"When to this place today it's a regular pizza place. The only thing is that there was only a pepperoni pizza made maybe we were there a bit early but that seemed weird... Inside the boulder station so great place to go after a movie or before! Nice price and a pretty big slice I'm a pizza lover so I recommend"}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice because there was a huge line for the buffet and we were trying to make a movie. This was quick - though it take her nearly 10 minutes to serve us the rewarmed pizza. Which, by the way, was so molten that it literally MELTED the plate she served it on. When I told her that it couldn't be healthy to eat something that just melted its way through styrofoam, she just gave me a blank stare.  That's OK, because - healthily laden with styrofoam shell or not - this pizza was dry, bland, and altogether nasty. Wash there even cheese on it? Not sure. Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore). How is it possible to make sausage flavorless? Dunno, but they managed.  On the way out, there was a line of 4-6 people deciding which tasty slice they'd order. As flashed my mutilated plate on my way to the garbage can, I whispered to the one in front, \"Save yourself - it's absolutely terrible,\" and she got the rest of the line to leave with her. Victory.  Yech. Should have gone hungry. Just terrible."}
{"text":"Stations (casino chain) replaced the Metro Pizza at Boulder Station with (what I believe to be) their own pizza chain called Slices. We avoided it for quite awhile; we finally gave it a try and wished we'd continued to avoid it. We ordered what I consider to be a 2-topping pizza consisting of mushrooms (all over), half pepperoni and half sausage. We were immediately informed that this is a 3-topping pizza and would be charged accordingly. I have never heard of this - is this the new norm? It's always been my experience that two \"half\" toppings count as one for pricing.   How was the finished product? The crust is extremely thin, soggy and lacking flavor; I am usually one to eat the crust edges, but this was so bland, there was no point. The cheese is exceptionally greasy and it didn't go to the edge of the pie. The mushrooms were sparse and carelessly strewn about; however, there was a fair amount of both the pepperoni and sausage. And oregano? It was treated more like a topping than a spice! Why is it many pizza joints think that good pizza should consist of large amounts of oregano? Oregano should enhance the flavor, not BE the flavor!   Now, I have a high tolerance for crappy pizza; this pizza was horrible, in my opinion, and being charged for 3 toppings really turned me off. What can I say that was good? The pizza wasn't outrageously priced (compared to other pizza places), it was ready fairly quickly, and they have good quality napkins."}
{"text":"A good slice of pizza, for when you just want to put something in your stomach. The pizza slice is both fresh and huge! For just over $3.50 the value is amazing."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot in the casino for a pizza place.   The pizza I ordered was grrrrreat!   And the garlic knots add on for a buck was good too.  Better than some of the pizza chains."}
{"text":"Four stars- just based upon me devouring a dozen garlic knots insert blushing emoji! The sauce is pretty good, okay pretty damn good. Indeed, I dipped those garlic nots into the delicious marinara sauce provided by Myk. He did suggest a couple of times ranch, but eh no;) I came across Slices Pizzeria after a movie last evening. First I must admit I noticed the brightly lit Fatburger sign. Then noticed Slices Pizzeria:)  Couldn't resist eavesdropping on Myk chatting up a customer who was ordering and then noticed those garlic knots look right. Yes, right. I'm from Long Island and one of 'those' who apparently can't locate a decent 'slice' of pizza here or adequate garlic knots. I have pies over nighter to me via FedEx from Umberto's pizza in New Hyde Park, Long Island.  There is a reason the can be ordered and over nighted from their website;). Now, if Slices Pizzeria can do a Grandma Pie- I would give this place ten stars. A slice of pizza should be folded and stay folded, cooked properly underneath. Now, I didn't have the pizza yet. Those garlic knots!!! I will be returning and trying the pizza! Now, Myk. Let me address this guy- he's charismatic and has a wonderful energy about him. He definitely adds into  my recommendation for Slices Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"This place might be okay if you're just getting a slice, but don't get a whole pizza, the quality isn't there.  Crust is very very dry and chewy, pizza has very little flavor,  definitely not worth paying $14-16 for a whole one of these pizzas. This is for fast fill-ups while taking a break from  playing slots.  The pizza chain they had in here before was better.  Slices is totally forgettable pizza.  Only tried the pizza, so can't  comment on anything else on the menu.  I wish they would get a really good pizza chain in here, but that probably won't ever happen."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza, 1/2 cheese and 1/2 ricotta and basil and took it home. It was 13 something with the toppings. The pizza is huge but we found the crust a bit chewy and a bit oily. I was disappointed with the 1/2 ricotta and basil...although there was a lot of Ricotta, there was only a tiny sprinkling of basil. Overall it was good, just not great."}
{"text":"Best Lv pizza I have had since moving here! Prices are reasonable and food is delicious!! Travel 12 miles just to get their  's!!!"}
