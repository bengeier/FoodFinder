{"text":"great potential and great location.  Went first for lunch a few weeks back and was NOT impressed - salsas were okay; however, HIGH sodium content! Cold chips, cold charro beans and cold cheese enchilada and restaurant was almost empty.  Service was so unprofessional and SLOW.   Decided to give another chance after a chance to iron out service, food line, etc.  BUMMER again!  Greeted by two hostesses (which their personal drinks were on the hostess stand along with a dirty rag and leaning on stand, etc.) who couldn't decide where to seat us in an almost empty restaurant.  They both had to walk back with us and talk about it for a while (quite unprofessional).  Waiter did have nice personality, I asked for wine he would only rattle off a few and never offered drink menu to us (up-sale with some margaritas or at least offer??).  Food took FOREVER - I wonder if it just sits there getting cold waiting on someone to deliver to tables.  Four salsas are advertised and only 2 come unless you ask for the others (AGAIN SALTY).  Waters (had to request) ran empty (maybe one of the slow hostesses should check on tables for water refills since apparently not a busy Saturday night), never asked my hubby if he wanted another beer before the food arrived.  Now the food:  grilled fish tacos - basically a 1/2 inch by 1 1/2 inch fish stick on a tortilla with some condiments. Flavorless charro beans, TINY enchiladas smothered (I understand true tacos are small; however, they should rethink the 3 sauce laden enchiladas (nothing inside) for $13!  I had to flag down the waiter after 30 minutes to get our check.   I have no idea what he was doing as there were only 2 tables to attend to on our side of the restaurant.  Maybe he had others (couldn't see anyone seated at all in the other section).  Management should rethink the layout of where servers are required to be so they can attend to the customers, or require they stay with their sections.  When I think Tex-Mex, I think fresh.  Salsas maybe are and that is about it.  El Camino needs an overhaul for more professional staff all around from hostess to managers.  In Charlotte - step it up to survive!"}
{"text":"Well I was hoping for at least some decent tacos, as I got a flyer in the mail for $1/Tuesday night Tacos...and was quite disappointed. I ordered 1 chicken, 1 beef and 1 pork Taco. The chicken was red and absolutely flavorless. The Beef was beyond overcooked and overseasoned. And the Pork had amazing flavor! That being said, the tortillas were cold, we ordered corn but were given their hybrid of flour and corn. And then they put lettuce, some type of hard cheese, and that was it. I expected maybe some salsa or something. Lime...and received neither. The salsa we were given was a mild pico, and then the other one was supposed to be a hot fire roasted salsa, but just tasted like it had a lot of bell peppers in it. We ordered the queso...which was melted Velveeta with some of the cold mild pico on it. Which was horrible. The pico made the cheese coagulate.   I also ordered a margarita with Patron. Well...that was the worst margarita I have ever had. I only took 2 drinks off of it, and the manager wouldn't even take it off my bill! It was a $15.50 margarita that I couldn't even drink. It tasted like straight sour, not even sweet and sour, there was no triple sec either! And it sure didn't taste like it had a drop of Patron in it.   Very dissatisfied with the entire experience. Don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"Whenever I start a sentence with \"Let's try a new place for dinner\" with hubster, he knows I have had too much time on my hands during the day and I have been reading the Yelp Times.  Needless to say my curiosity was peaked by the fact this place opened across the street from its competition - holy huevos rancheros - that takes guts and a confidence in your food.  Well I was not disappointed.  Interior kind of funky but I will eat off formica if the food is good.  No formica (whew!) but Theresa our server steered us in the right direction with every choice - including Negro Modelo on tap - OLE'  - food was as authentic as I have had since moving here from California - I know, I know, California people always rave about Mexican food in California but really, it's just a hop, skip and a jump to Mexico so we do know our nachos!  Loved this place, street tacos were awesome, guacamole was great and did I mention Negro Modelo!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. My husband and I stopped here for dinner before heading to Park Terrace for a movie. We only had about an hour for dinner, and we figured that would be plenty of time. The restaurant was empty when we got inside. I found this a little unusual for a new place, but figured it was just a slow night. With it being so slow, I assumed I would get fast service. Not the case! We sat for 10 minutes before someone asked us what we would like to drink. It took several more minutes before we were able to get our order in.   I ordered a spinach and cheese quesadilla with a side of refried beans. I figured I would keep it simple, since I wasn't sure of their food quality. Maybe 15 minutes later I got a cheese and chicken quesadilla with no beans. I told the waitress that wasn't what I ordered, but because we had a movie to catch, I didn't want her to bring me out a new entree. I decided to just eat the chicken quesadilla. It was very greasy and not very good. My husband got a three taco entree and said only one taco was really edible. I ended up eating his beans, since I never got my own. There are much better Mexican restaurants than this place. I wouldn't recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Terrible and bland food. Had a groupon offer and went expecting mediocre Mexican with some good beer specials and decent appetizers. I really wanted to give this management team one more shot.   I tried the \"Iguana Enchiladas\" and found three or four hairs in the dish. It was over cooked and looked as though the chef had just forgotten about it. I also noticed the chefs smoking cigarettes outside when we left. I know this is common, but please tell your chefs to go BEHIND the building!   On top of that, the server was rude and we were rushed out of the building as they were setting up for the \"night club\" that is conveniently located IN THE SAME ROOMS as this \"restaurant\".   It seems to me that the only reason the management opened up this restaurant is because they needed a way to keep the alcohol flowing in the club, and thus had to act as a restaurant as they closed the 'Andrew Blair's' restaurant as a result of poor food and lack of clientele.   Avoid this place at all costs. It's also comical that there are dozens of fake reviews with 5 stars from people that have one total review and just made their accounts in the last week!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best fresh salsa along with great lunch specials. The fajitas are enough for two people.  The service friendly and fast. It is a great value and , I eat here at least twice a week. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Truly simple authentic delicious tacos. I don't know why everyone is giving this place such a hard time!  My friends and I got the $1 Tuesday tacos (chicken, beef, pork) and we all thought they were fantastic! Margarita mix was clearly home made, and the service was great even though they were very busy. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"why would any business put the garage doors on the inside of the restaurant, i thought those were to open up to the outside?  food was weird, broccoli in an enchilada?  obviously not Texans -"}
{"text":"Great chips, fresh made salsa, pico de gallo and guacamole.  Only thing unimpressive was the rice.  I don't get the two star average!"}
{"text":"Um... Might have been our worst experience in Charlotte. It took 20 mins to for the waitress to take our order. On top of waiting another 20 minutes for the food to arrive, our order was not correct. Instead of waiting for a reorder, we ate what we wanted and topped off our bellies with chips. The food was meh at best.  The \"manager\" bypassed our table several times even after asking if the people next to us were enjoying themselves. They did comp one of the entrees and a margarita. Felt like this deserved my first post on yelp. Left a bad taste in our mouths. Will not return!"}
{"text":"Best margarita I've had in Charlotte.  No Joke.  plus they come in pint glasses so they're bigger than most in town & bonus - Thursdays are $3 margarita night.  Tuesday's are dollar taco night.  I'm a fan of the trailer park taco & I get it \"trashy\" (with queso).  My only complaint is it's location.  I live in Plaza Midwood so it's a bit of a drive, but probably good since I'd be there every thursday for $3 margaritas if it was closer!"}
{"text":"The service is pretty bad, but the food is good and the portion are super sized. Taco Tuesday is a great deal and the tacos are great. I love getting the combos because there is always food to bring home and it reheats well."}
{"text":"Better than expected!  After reading some of the reviews here, my wife and I were pretty hesitant to use our Groupon at El Camino. But, this place was awesome! The service was great and they were very flexible on your order. We ordered the guacamole to start with and it was great. Their salsa, both roasted tomato and pico, were really good and some of the best we've had in CLT. For dinner we ordered the beef fajitas, per the recommendation of the waitress, and the three taco plate. The fajitas were great and were too much food for the dinner. Huge portions. For the tacos we ordered the Baja, the pork and chicken. They were all very tasty and delicious. They were served on fresh made corn tortillas. All in all, this is a great new addition to the Park Road area. We will definitely be making a return trip to El Camino."}
{"text":"Best $4 margaritas in town!! I always et the Iguana dish with the chicken enchiladas, refrained beans, rice and cheese sauce. Best pico de gallo and salsa I've ever had!!"}
{"text":"HAnds down the best salsa I've ever had. The meal was great too (I've tried the quesadillas, fajitas, and burritos), but the portions are almost too big. I would've like to see smaller portions for a reduced price and this place would quickly jump up my favorites list, especially with the outdoor patio for perfect people watching on Montford."}
{"text":"Wow, people really aren't crushing on this place. I actually think this is a great place to get fajitas because they offer a really big portion (2 can really split it as a meal) and the vegetable mix is more than the same ol' onions and peppers. You can find broccoli, squash, etc. in there and I bet if you ask for more they would give it to you because the service is very accommodating. This is the only place I've found that offers \"hybrid\" tortillas- it's a cross between flour and corn and are perfect! They don't fall apart like corn, but are more interesting tasting than flour. Yum!   Their refried beans are also delicious.    I am not as big of a fan of their tacos- they were a little dry but the chipotle brisket had tons of flavor for sure. They just need to work on the toppings to make it a little more moist and less heavy. I got a combo once and there was no way I was finishing all that food.   Is it the best Tex Mex place in the world? No. Will I be back? Absolutely. I don't know that this will be a mainstay for the long haul (this spot seems to be cursed) but we definitely prefer this to Mexican 1900 or Maverick Rock Taco."}
{"text":"Supposedly Todd Townsend is involved with this place, but I'd be shocked if he really thinks this food is worth attaching his name to.  This is some of the worst food I've ever had in Charlotte in over 20 years---and I've eaten in plenty of places that would make your hair stand on end.  Crummy queso dumped over everything, salsa with no flavor, rubber chicken burrito.  The place was nearly empty and it still took 20 minutes to get our food.  Oh--the Mexican ethnic slurs on the menu are a nice touch as well (\"cheeken leetle\"---really?).  This place just screams \"rich frat boys need something to do, so Daddy, git me a restaurant.\""}
{"text":"Went here for dinner due to a groupon deal and this place was just meh.  Nothing stood out from a food perspective and the restuarant was empty on a Friday night around 7.      We ordered the guacamole and it was not made tableside.  The menu says homemade but I would bet it was made out of a bag.  The gauc was too smooth to be \"hand smashed\" and it was topped with a lilttle lime, corn salsa and tortilla chips.  I make better gauc at home.  For dinner, I ordered the democrat burrito which was very big but very bland, wasn't impressed.  They do have Negra Modelo on tap which is nice but not enough to bring me back again."}
{"text":"So we would love to see this restaurant succeed, because a tex mex restaurant on Montford is just what we needed! We went with a group of 5 on Saturday night and it was not too crowded.. No wait... But after ten minutes a server came to us to get a drink order. We had never been given a drink or dinner menu. We asked for a drink menu and she looked confused and gave us a beer list. It had no info on margaritas etc. we asked her about margaritas and she said they had frozen or on the rocks. I ordered frozen and she showed back up 20 minutes later with on the rocks. When I said that I ordered frozen she said that I was stuck with on the rocks because the machine was broken. Weird. Chips and salsa were no flavor... very bleh. They serve a hot and mild and the hot is suler hot which is fine but neither have any flavor. W finally got menus and water after about 30 minutes of sitting. Entrees were all pretty good... But we ordered guacamole and it was basically mashed avocado with no seasoning or flavor. How hard is it to mess up guac? Ad we ordered a roasted stuffed jalepeno app and it had no flavor at all. They ran out of beer glasses and the waitress totally screwed up a beer pour of a 6 dollar beer. All foam. She also stopped at our table to \" show us\" another tables food . So weird. Overall we thought about leaving a couple of times... Probably should have. The whole room they put us in cleared out at 9:30 so we sat by ourselves for about 45 until we got our food. Overall dissapointed. They could make simple tweaks to correct food and also work on service mucho!!! Also change menu to explain food ( like how many tacos come on a plate?)."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  My husband and I come at least once as week for lunch, dinner, or the night scene.  The food is seriously delicious... from the chips, to the fresh pico de gallo, to the enchiladas and tacos!  The margaritas are $4 everyday and are awesome... two of them and I'm done!  This place is great during the day, but I also love the nightlife here.  They always have more than one DJ on the weekends and the place is packed.  If you're craving a bar scene, hang out at the bar.  If you're craving a club scene, hang out in the middle where the dance floor opens up.  If you're craving a more chill vibe, the patio is awesome and has a separate DJ that takes requests.  Not sure why they don't have better ratings, we've probably been at least 20 times and have always had a great experience no matter what time of day!  Not to mention, they have $1 tacos on Tuesday... do you need anymore reasons to try this place?!?   Try the trailer park tacos but make it trashy!"}
{"text":"Good concept, terrible execution. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks. Waitress delivered a beer that was half foam. She wasnt familiar with drink menu. No specialty margaritas. They ran out of glassware. Skip the apps - pricey and underwhelming. Main course was decent but it took 2 hours from the time we walked in to get our entres. Hopefully this place will get with the program and live up to its potential."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for somethig light and wanted to try this place out.  I walked and the decor was strange, but it somehow fit.  (knights car rims wall ahem) The salsa and chips came out as soon as I sat down.  Fresh chips and fresh tasting chunky salsa.  I asked the server what to get knowing i didnt want a giant burrito ( which she told me were massive) and she suggested the baja shrimp tacos.  This came with a side of iffy rice and refried beans which were ok.  The shrimp taco shells were small and brittle. Litterally I picked the first one up and the bottom fell out seperating the shrimp, cabbage, sauce, and everything.  I looked at the second taco ( you only get two) and there was a hole in the bottom of that shell.  I laughed as I picked it up because it was pointless.  Everything dropped all over the plate again. Hello shrimp taco salad. The good thing was though you could see what you were eating.  3 jumbo pieces of shrimp per taco.  For me the salsa and chips were the best part besides the $2 Mexican beers.  I was really hoping this would be my new place and tried everything to give it a shot, but I doubt I will go back.  I think 2 stars might be a little harsh, but there isn't a 2.5 star"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Interior is super weird. Awkward curtain behind the host desk. Waaaay too many doors, seriously.. Our waiter was so rude! Who brings a check while you're eating your food?! You could have atleast waited five extra minutes til we were finished. Didn't offer dessert or anything. Dude, we all work in the service industry, youcould have made some seriously money. Don't be such a dick next time! I'll consider coming back but I definitely would want another server.."}
{"text":"In short really liked it as authentic Tex-Mex. Very high quality ingredients and fair prices. Went for lunch on Thursday. We were actually headed to Roasting Company across the street but noticed Camino had opened up. The chips were warm and fresh tasting and they had two types of fresh salsa. One was like pico de gallo and the other was a bit less chunky with fresh herbs and more of a kick. Both really good.   I had the brisket tacos. The meat was really, really good. Well cooked and great flavor. I was concerned it would be greasy but it wasn't at all. Good homemade tasting corn tortillas too.  Very authentic tasting.  I got the charro beans and wasn't a huge fan. Probably should have gone with the refrieds, they looked really good.   A friend had a burrito with carne asada and he really enjoyed it, commenting on the quality of the meat and fresh ingredients.  He said it was the best steak he'd had at a Mexican/Tex-Mex joint and he's pretty picky.   Another had the pork enchiladas and was similarly impressed. I saw at least 5 or 6 things I wanted to try so will definitely be back. I think the entire tab for my meal with drink was about $14 after tax and tip.   Service was very attentive but it wasn't all that busy, so maybe hard to judge.  The manager stopped by to make sure we were all happy with the food and we were.   Give it a shot if you want authentic tasting Tex-Mex and not the typical bland seasoned beef Mexican slop that is so pervasive."}
{"text":"Only commenting on the nightlife of this place and have not tried the food. I was really pumped when I saw Andrew Blairs had closed and this place had opened up, I was hoping for a totally different type of bar, nope its still Andrew Blairs but with a Mexican theme. The DJ was terrible! Played 90s pop hits, come on who plays Backstreet Boys in 2013? There are so many talented DJs in Charlotte you need to step it up. This place really has the opportunity to separate itself from all the other mediocre bars on Montford, but instead it looks like its going to be on the next episode of 'Bar Rescue'."}
{"text":"Have been coming to El Camimo for a few months.  Food is excellent staff is friendly and prices very reasonable.  I love the Ceaser salad the fajitas are great.  You will not leave hungry and it will not break the bank."}
{"text":"Terrible service tonight. Bartenders advised they did not have grand mariner nor did they want to make tops help margaritas even tho we were charged $12 for top shelf. We were charged $12 each but bartender was the WORST. Very rude bartenders who have NO busIness in the hospitality industry!"}
{"text":"This is the newest spot to hit Montford Drive in Charlotte, and it is a great addition.  It takes the place of the old Andrew Blairs restaurant.  The Food at El Camino is really good - some pieces will require many Charlotte \"Mexican\" eaters to keep an open mind. The flavors (and some of the textures) are different than many of the overly cheesy (literally) mex spots around town.  We ordered several items and shared them among our group of six.  There were some real bright spots-  1) The Sauces- The items we ordered- and I believe many that are on the menu- can be ordered with any of five or six sauces.  I did not do a good job of taking note of their names, but we tried them all on each of the entrees.  These sauces REALLY change the complexion of each dish, so playing around with sauce/entrée combinations here is fun, and yields a lot of flavor.  The list of sauces is sort of hidden toward the back of the menu, but order several.  2) The Bullets- These were slices of fresh jalapeño peppers, topped with a cheese blend, some spices (and maybe some bacon or chorizo) and then baked.  They are great!- and they are spicy hot.  You get the real flavor and real heat of a jalapeño pepper here- there must be a few seeds hidden in there!   3) Fajitas- We had shrimp, chicken, and steak.  All three were good, but I Liked the spice on the perfectly grilled shrimp the best.  The chicken was good, too- and was full of flavor AND moisture (not all dried out like at some spots).  Also, they had what the server called a \"hybrid\" shell- a tortilla made of corn and flour.  I like them- they were soft like flour shells, but had a bit of nutty flavor, too.  4) The Guacamole- Really good rendition of fresh =-made guac.  I like mine with a little more garlic flavor, but this is an excellent Guacamole for a restaurant.  Clearly made fresh from avocados, and not made from pre-ordered avocado pulp.  It comes with the fajitas, too- so no extra charges.  5) the Chili- its like nothing you've ever had.  More like a Cincinnati chili, but still with Tex Mex flavor.  It is sweet and rich, complex and full of flavor.  But nothing like the tomato chili you make at home with 5-alarm spices.  Have an open mind,  and enjoy it!  5) The Value- Great prices.  Most things around $8-$9, and the expensive combo fajitas were $12.  The portions are huge, and the price is right,  Most diners will get dinner and lunch tomorrow out of an order.    I didn't have a drink, but I heard a couple at the bar saying the margaritas were made with all fresh juices......something for next time.  A few improvements are needed at this brand new spot......seems they are still working on the décor.  Its a funky kind of look in there.  Also, the service was good enough, but our server wasn't fully up to speed to answer some questions about the menu.  With the complexities of multiple sauces, and items that many diners won't already know by heart, it is important for the staff to know the menu in depth.  This needs to get fixed.  So, its a bit of an adventure, but you will enjoy El Camino if you approach it with a sense of adventure.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. Went last Friday and it was practically empty inside at 7:00 pm! My fish taco was good, shrimp taco was ok. Husband didn't like his burrito at all - too salty! Guacamole was good but not better than what I could make at home (for less than $6.50). We won't be going back!  But glad we at least had a \"buy one entree get one entree free\" coupon!!"}
{"text":"Don't test your patience in this place or you'll lose it  2 days ago was my third trip to the restaurant and by far the worst experience. My server was absolutely incompetent and unable to do a single thing correctly. I had to beg for chips, water and for my husband's beer. This time I decided to invite a guest and she was extremely disappointed as well and I was equally embarrassed. I filled out my comment card to give to the manager which it didn't make it back to the \"manager\" as I have not heard anything back. It will be very hard for me to recommend the restaurant and being a newer place in a crowded market you can't afford to many of these negative experiences. Especially in the era of social media and other food related forums.   Food for thought. Go anywhere in Montford drive but here."}
{"text":"We just bought the Groupon last week, and after reading so many negative Yelp reviews, thought we should try  El Camino before it closed.  We were VERY pleasantly surprised with the El Camino.  Greeted nicely at the front and quickly escorted to the table.  Our server promptly brought us nice crisp chips and Pico salsa.  We reviewed the menu and chose the Bullet (stuffed grilled Jalapeno peppers) appetizer.  It was served promptly - 6 or 7 large sized jalapeno halves, stuffed with cheese, grilled, and served with sour cream and guacamole on a bed of lettuce.  This was only $6.99 - and it was delicious. We asked the server to bring us plates because it was not convenient to eat this from the large platter it was served on.    For entrees my husband chose the steak and shrimp fajitas and I chose \"#7\" combination - a pork carnitas taco, a chicken taco and a beef enchilada.  Entrees were served with rice and the charros beans.  I tasted the rice and beans and they were fine, but I prefer to concentrate on the main event.    My plate was garnished with nice chunks of avocado and a lime slice.  We had plenty to eat and leftovers for lunch.  Atmosphere - lots to look at. A previous reviewer had mentioned a \"knight\".  One of the focal points in the room is a large 3D \"mural\" of miscellaneous found objects that have been spray painted gold, including a suit of armor.  I prefer to think of the knight as a conquistador.  Other objects were a mannequin, egg carton, car rim, colander - just a real mish-mash of stuff.  String lighting, dark walls, Tex-Mex music, all fine with me.    The manager came over to ask if all was ok and I mentioned the negative Yelp reviews.  His response was that they were a little overwhelmed by response to the Groupon and were taking action with the various complaints and using that as a learning experience.  All in all, we were very happy with our meal and service. Four stars - taking off one for the high price of the draft beer, and also the el cheapo salt and pepper shakers - the ones where you take off lid and grind that you buy at the dollar store.  Those are minimal.  We live in the neighborhood and will be back, especially for the Bullet Jalapenos and some beer specials.   Please give them a try."}
{"text":"I think that this place is somehow getting a bad rep and It really shouldn't be.  I received a promo in the mail and before we headed out, I headed on to Yelp to check out the reviews. I was extremely worried going in there.  GREAT CHIPS & SALSA - As soon as we arrived, we were seated. I server came right over with two bowls of salsa and some chips. The pica was really good. Yes, its not salsa, its Pica but who doesn't like Pica?  The second was not really hot so I was confused because a lot of the reviews said it was too hot to eat. Maybe they saw the reviews too and toned it down because me and my boyfriend thought it was awesome and gobbled up too bowls of it!  DECENT MARGARITAS - Next we each ordered Margaritas. These are supposed to be made with home made sour mix.  They were pretty good but not the best I have had. Don't get me wrong, the next time I want a margarita, it'll prob be from here. Oh and who ever complained about them not having a drink menu will be glad to hear that they do have one now!  Jalapeno Bullets - These were a bit of a disappointment. They were good but not very hot. There wasn't really much too them at all. They came with a heaping pile of Mexican Flag (Gauc, Sour Cream & Pica) which I gladly ate with my chips.   For our entrees we went with what seemed to be the most popular with the reviews. The fish tacos and the Lubbock Enchiladas. The Fish tacos were really good.  The Lubbock Enchiladas not so much. They came out small looking like Tostadas.  They had a ton of meat that was highly seasoned...way too much for my liking. I'll definitely stick to the tacos next time or possibly branch out to some fajitas next time."}
{"text":"Simply put, if you like dog food, eat here.  I had high hopes for this place - love the decor and redesign - great location. That's where the love ends. An inexperienced server, grease-laden tortilla chips, chorizo tasting of meat not intended for human consumption, extremely over-salted chicken and pork tacos and an upset stomach for an evening - not a place I'll give a second chance.  I'd go here for a beer - super cool bar area (the person who did the design deserves major kudos) but definitely not for food (although considerable alcohol consumption prior to eating might help the taste of the food).  Hopefully management or the owners will read these reviews and get a restaurant intervention before it's too late."}
{"text":"I predicted it and it's now official.  El Camino is closed.  There's already a new establishment that opened in part of the space.    The problem was there were too many Tex/Mex places around and this one added nothing to the mix."}
{"text":"After reading few reviews, I do admit that I was a bit nervous but I came to this reminder as I have a decal of it in my living room.  \"Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it.\"   Confucius  Now.. thanks to LivingSocial - I was being given an opportunity to try this place out and boy, it was a good decision!  One warning: They do not serve food on a plate but PLATTER. Come hungry and try to relax...relaxed stomach enjoys food much more easily.  I convinced my 17-years old daughter into accompanying me to this restaurant.  Chips and salsa never ran out.  Yes, they actually \"refill\" them... and how we loved their salsa (there are two kinds). Crispy, fresh and delicious! Don't overeat them or you'll ruin your entreé!  I ordered Shrimp Fajitas while she ordered (her mistake but it made a good doggie bag!) a huge combo: \"3 Combinations\" as it contains three different taco... baja taco, trailer park taco and crossroad taco. They all literally covered the entire PLATTER.  Servers were wonderfully nice and pleasant...  Try this place - I went there early afternoon.. less people, better it might be for you? I dunno. I defy will return!"}
{"text":"Enchiladas = No. Don't do it. Seriously. I had the cheese enchiladas and the \"red\" sauce I thought they would come with was instead very nearly brown and was not appealing to me. That coupled with the very brown, slightly hard rice and clumped beans, covered in cheese that wasn't even warm because it sat too long before I received it (and therefore was clumped cheese as well). I was not happy at all with my meal choice but I was with our office staff and so I did not make a big deal, I just ate what I could. I ordered the Mexican flag (guac, pico and sour cream) and that came on lettuce so I scraped all the sauce off one enchilada and tried to make it a salad. Yeah, whatever. The rest of my tummy I filled with water. Needless to say, I felt gross when I left (lol). The chips and salsa served as appetizers were not bad but it was too salty for my taste. The pico appeared and tasted very fresh. A few members of our table ordered the side salad and that also appeared fresh and I was totally jealous I did not order one. A couple other members of the table had chicken fajitas and they appeared very appetizing. Each of them said they were happy with their choice. So, guess it was just me and my stupid attraction to enchiladas that got me in trouble here. Haha."}
{"text":"We were headed to Duckworth's for dinner and drinks and noticed this new place and decided to check it out. Walking in, the hostess seemed confused and we ended up sitting in the  bar area. The waitress had absolutely no clue what she was doing. We tried to order a pitcher and some margaritas. She couldn't tell us if they even had pitchers here or what beers they had. Nor could she tell us how much margaritas cost or what types they had. Turns out they didn't even have the kegs hooked up so we had to order bottles. Only mexican beers they had were Negro Modelo and Corona. weak. So we order a few shitty beers and the waitress proceeds to card us. We're all 25 and don't typically even get carded. My friend (who is clearly at least 21) only had his social security card so they wouldn't serve him. I'm someone who goes out drinking quite often and I can't remember the last time this has happened. We stormed out and went across the street to Duckworth's where we were served with no questions asked like normal. We even went to Angry Ale's after that where we were not carded either. We didn't end up eating there but if the service and other factors are any indication the food sucks, too.  I'm pretty disappointed because I live very close to montford and I really liked their menu prices and love mexican food, I wanted this to be a regular spot of mine. Never again. Steer clear, this place will be closed in a month"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We were not the least bit impressed with the food. Why would anybody frequent El Camino when you have Maverick's so close??? The difference between the two is everything. If you want REALLY great Tex Mex go to Maverick's."}
{"text":"Eating at El Camino was a definite new experience. Being from Houston and, thus, a native Texan, I'm always dying to try out a place that bills itself as Tex-Mex.   It would not surprise me if anyone that had worked on this menu had never eaten TexMex.   I expected to find a wide variety of colorful and flavorful foods and instead what I walked away with was bland, boring combinations.   The meal started out on the wrong foot with a 'pico salsa'. It's just Pico de Gallo. Except they call it salsa. Ok.   I ordered Guacamole. I could go off on a rant about how Guacamole is considered gratis in my native land, flowing as freely as salsa from ladles in just about every restaurant, but I won't, because that's not the way things are done around here. Lets just say it was mushed avocado with no flavoring and a spoonful of the pico 'salsa' on top. Pass on it.   I decided to order the Quattro combination. This consisted of two beef tacos, a cheese and beef enchilada and a side of nachos.  The tacos came out in their flour tortillas, as requested, and consisted of beef, lettuce, cheese, pico 'salsa' and an avocado slice. Despite that wonderful sounding combination of ingredients the whole effect is overshadowed by the flavor of the ground beef. It's difficult to explain, but it's WAY over spiced. The strength of the flavor is so overpowering that you might as well just be eating spoonfuls of ground beef, because that's all you're tasting. I was only able to get through about 1 and a quarter of these.   I turned my attention to the cheese enchiladas. I have a very special place in my heart for cheese enchiladas and so I love trying them out at new places. The enchilada was covered in some sort of brown sauce. I'd love to be able to tell you what this sauce was, but I can't. Because it had no flavor. As such a direct contrast to the beef tacos, this was a huge surprise. Additionally, the tortilla and cheese had the same taste. Which is to say, none. Very, very bland and in flavorful.   I went next to the beef enchilada. I took one bite and had that same sensation that occurred with the tacos. Very, very, very over seasoned ground beef and flavorless, bland tortilla and sauce (same sauce as on the cheese enchilada).   I've saved the best for last, literally. The nachos were not bad. They basically take chips and put beans and cheese on them and melt about 6-9 or so and put them on your plate. Speaking of beans, the rice and beans served with my meal were meh. Not outstanding in either way. The nachos were good, but they were simple, which hits more to the heart of TexMex than anything else I bathe restaurant, no matter how many Texas stars they want to hang on their ceiling. One thing about the nachos though. They had jalapeños on them. But they seemed to be roasted and were chunks of jalapeño. Now, as I mentioned, being a native of Texas I don't think I've ever actually eaten a roasted jalapeño and I practically grew up on TexMex. The only peppers I've had roasted (on a regular basis anyways) are poblanos. And you do that for chile rellenos. The roasted jalapeños were just terrible. They were slimy and gross looking. I ate a couple and picked the rest off, but the nachos otherwise were all right.   Service was ok was dead when I went so difficult to judge. My advice would be to stay away unless you're there to drink. The bar area did look VERY nice and maybe that's what they're focused on instead of making great, authentic TexMex."}
{"text":"Ugh, hands down the worst tex mex I've ever had. Greasy tacos with little meat on them, burrito smothered in velveta like cheese food product with 6 or 7 tiny pieces of chicken. Chips and salsa were OK."}
{"text":"This place is not for us Chilli Heads but the food is fresh and pretty tasty, I really overate and paid for it today with 1 hour 15 minutes of Yoga Sculpt torture. The moment we walked in we were greeted and sat by the nice Hostess and the water was brought out right away, the servers were friendly and polite even though 2/7th of our party decided we should sit outside and we had to move. The drinks were very nice (I kept forgetting to state: no salt/sugar on my rims) the most memorable off hand was the \"TIto rita\" and the 100 year old Margarita, very tasty. The chips were crunchy, the Pico was fresh and the salsas were good but not very Spicy. The Guac. was good as was the Queso dip without the watery salsa in it, and the bullets were nice but offered no gunpowder(Spicyless) I sampled most of the tacos, all were very tasty but they needed to be drained so got to wear a good bit of sauce home. Remember to eat directly over your plate! I had the Brisket taco( 1 bite), filling with lots of meat. The \"trailer park\" taco which was really tasty but contained fried Chicken which I avoid( I did have 2 bites instead of one) a shrimp taco I liked enough to eat more than half and my Baja taco which I devoured with Grilled Mahi that was moist and juicy but did not drip. I loved that there was lots of Avocado and Slaw to go on it. Overall it was a good meal with great service, I would go back but I'd carry my own  Hot sauce. The one I use to spice my food and clean the rust off the Chrome on my car!"}
{"text":"We bought a groupon, and if you're thinking about ever trying this place buy one now. I'm thankful I only spent half of what I should have on the meal we were served. Not that my server wouldn't have tried anything to make it better, as his only table he was more than willing to aid us, but I don't think there was much he could do.   Sunday night around 7, this place was close to dead, the bar completely empty (and even looked off limits). This of course gave us plenty of room to take in what had been used to decorate... but I'll just let you take that in for yourself. We ordered our waters and then I noticed there wasn't a drink menu on the table, or even addressed by our server, but after reading Andrew's review I guess I know why. We looked over the appetizers and I realized almost everything is smothered in cheese. I know, I know, we're in a tex/mex restaurant, but there are PLENTY of dishes that only use cheese as a smaller component or use none at all. Making queso dips and cheese-laden nachos with only one or two other ingredients is taking the easy (and cheap) way out. While we waited for the guac we snacked on the chips (yum) and the only salsa we were given, the pico. I really enjoyed it. To me it tasted more like a ceviche base than your regular run of mill pico, I would go back for that. The guac was decent, nothing to write home about.  We ordered the shrimp fajitas and the three tacos as entrees. Starting with the fajitas - nice portions, not the best marinade but some decent flavor on really overcooked shrimp (they were curling in on themselves), and broccoli(???) mixed in with the peppers and onions. I really liked the rice (my dining partner would disagree with me), and I got the cabbage slaw subbed in for the beans, good deal on my part. They automatically served corn, but I heard a woman ask for some flour tortillas and the server delivered.  But the three tacos, that poor poor thing. The highlight was the baja (mahi) taco and unfortunately my boyfriend ate that one first, so it was all down hill after. The pork taco was filled with tough almost inedible pieces, and the chicken had no flavor. No joke. I didn't believe him so I had a piece and it really didn't taste like anything, not even chicken. The beans, oh the charro beans, a luke warm mess that tasted like probably exactly what it was - unrinsed, unseasoned, straight from the can into a bowl.  The manager came by, but we only knew he was the manager because we overheard him telling another table he was about ten minutes before (still never gave his name). He asked if everything was okay and then asked for my voucher, never communicating with our server because about two minutes later our server asked to see it too. Since we only had water our bill was completely covered, but I guess they've never had to deal with running a ticket for zero dollars so we could leave him a tip using a card. But they got that straightened out and should be able to handle that in the future.   I'd be interested in returning to see the bar, and to have some more chips and salsa, but as far as their tex/mex goes they're far from the top."}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I went for lunch today and we were probably one of their first customers for the day.  We were greeted by a very nice hostess and seated immediately.  Within seconds of being seated, our server placed chips and two types of salsa (a Pico style one and a hot restaurant style one) on our table and took our drink order.  She was nice and prompt.  She then asked us if we had any questions about the menu and took our order.  The chips were fresh and really good but the salsas didn't really have too much flavor.  The Pico style one was very basic and flavorless.  The only flavor I got from the hot salsa was 'hot'.  It wasn't too spicy but that was pretty much the only thing I got from that.  I ordered the Armadillo Burrito.  All I can say is....meh.  It didn't really have much flavor, and nothing to really brag about.  It came with a choice of either refried beans or Charro bean, I ordered the Charro and I've had better.    The others at my table seemed to have the same opinion about their food choices.  One of my co-workers ordered the Lubbock Enchiladas and he said he really like them.  If I visit this restaurant again, I'll be sure to try those.    This is a new restaurant so I would definitely try it again once it's been open for awhile to give it another shot.  The service was great and our server was very helpful and super nice.  The manager also stopped by to make sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"llanura!  Which is Spanish for 'plain'! And I know not how to say bland in Español.   My boyfriend and I went to El Camino  #1 - Because we enjoy Mexican #2-  Because we like trying new places #3 - Because we had a Groupon  When we got to the restaurant we were greeted and seated promptly. We were given chips and salsa and our drink order was taken.  The chips are pretty good, and the salsa (not the pico) is nice as well.   For our appetizer we chose the 'El Diablo Dip' which is Chili con queso dip with guac, taco meat, sour cream, and pico on top. The Queso disturbingly thick. So thick in fact that it was just unappetizing to me.  Next the entrees: I had the 'Democrat' burrito. It's a very big burrito I'll give them that - but when it came out it did not look appealing at all. It had mole sauce smeared on the top (which it didn't mention on the menu) so it looked like a large heap of...you know what! The steak inside had a funny taste, not sure what it was marinated in, and the rice and beans inside were bland. The overall taste was one dimensional, and I got no wow factor, other that WOW I already paid for this meal through Groupon, 'Down the Hatch!' Don't get me wrong, if you enjoy bland food this is the place for you, so go ahead and get crazy!  My boyfriend order the Iguana enchiladas, which looked little taquitos. They once again had the dreaded thick chili con queso on them which my boyfriend said \"It [chili con queso] over powers the flavor of the overall dish, if the dish has any flavor at all with out the cheese\".  I can only say that we won't go back because the food as a whole is not that great. Nothing to write home about, nothing that I can't live without.  Sorry El Camino,nunca más!"}
