{"text":"I ordered a birthday cake from this bakery thinking that it would be really good since one of my relatives constantly gets their birthday cakes from this establishments. Upon digging into the cake, I found a piece of an eggshell inside their green tea mousse cake...welp at least I know they use brown eggs... As well, when I went to pick the cake up I noticed a rather foul and dank smell to this place.  I decided to give this place a second chance and when I picked up my order I noticed the foul and dank smell again but this time it was so strong my nose could not bear it for another second and I was holding my breath in for as long as I could until I could reach the door. I am now avoiding this place like the plague and trying cakes from other bakeries from now on..."}
{"text":"One of the good Chinese bakery standing in Chinatown for more than 10 years. Some bake goods are still good. Service could be better."}
{"text":"Furama ????? is one of the established traditional Hong Kong bakeries that maintains a very casual atmosphere. It offers a great variety of popular buns and my favourites are the sausage buns, pineapple buns and deep fried curry beef buns. I also like to order a cup of hot Hong Kong milk tea to accompany my pastries. I would say that Furama's quality is above average in Chinatown's standard."}
{"text":"To go place. Ice coffees are good.Make sure you got ur buns fresh, period. I love their sesame balls,and Grilled chicken buns. Better for coming early in the morning,they may prepare stuff fresher z"}
{"text":"I love coming to this bakery. The variety is vast and the price is low compared to the one in Financial district.  The buns are baked on premise.  Depending on when you go, it's fresh out of the oven."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Clean, well stocked and staff were available to assist. We were so full from eating at King Noodle House, but decided to stop in as we could not resist the sweet smells coming from this place. There were an assortment of pastries, some so big and pentiful that they could have definitely been a side to a dish. Lots of authentic asian delights. Go in, you will not be sorry! Notnyour average bakery. Everything was fresh and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Very reasonable pastries. My favourites come with pie(meat pie, curry pie, Apple pie...) because it is crispy outside moist inside! I especially recommend you to try the meat pie!! Will be no tax pay more than 6 pastries."}
{"text":"So not to long ago, I was frolicking around King street and I came across a furama -- great place. Food was delicious and man, you can't just beat the prices.  But then I went to Chinatown because it was Chinese New Year (like where else would I go, right?) and as I was once again on the quest for some delicious, AUTHENTIC, Asian cuisine, I peeked down Spadina Road and saw Furama.  Now at first, I was about to call up the nice Chinese man from the furama on King street and tell him some Asians were ripping him off. Like, how dare he steal the authenticity and originality that comes with the name. But then I thought, \"hey, no need to burst their boba bubbles (tapioca), gotta save it for the milk tea ya know\"  So the outside wasn't as pleasing aesthetically, but you never judge a book by its cover. And let me tell you, this was a Toronto Star best seller. I had the teriyaki bun, and it tasted like It was fresh out of Japan. The outside was so crispy, which contested nicely with the succulence of the chicken inside.   Then guess what ... it turns out both are run by the same big boss man, crazy! But yeah really good."}
{"text":"For Chinese pastries, this one appears to be a hit. There are always a room full of patrons slurping coffee and eating some of the sweet and savoury goodies offered at the \"Desserts Garden\".  After doing some shopping at Chinatown Centre, this is a good place to stop off for a snack. However, they close pretty early, so by 6pm, there were few options left. I circled the cases a few times before discovering a sweet bit of yum.  A mochi-filled with sweet peanuts. This was the perfect golfball-sized snack and filled with super sweet peanuts. I have also had the pineapple buns, and red bean beans which are a little greasy and buttery, which may be just the best way.  Also sell a variety of lightly iced cakes and asian 'sweets'."}
{"text":"This place is a fixture in Chinatown and has a decent reputation. The sweets are good with quick service and a nice little sit down spot to eat your desserts. Also some of the regulars go here for a Chinese style breakfast which reminds me of bacon and eggs, except the eggs are in a noodle soup. Stand around for a little while with your tray and a spot to sit usually opens up. A favourite is their sugar donuts, in plain view, begging you to grab a few, as you come in the front door. A gigantic picture window lets in the light and hubbub from Spadina and was famously sprayed with bullets late one night adding to the street cred. 'Yay! I'm a fan' applies wholeheartedly to Furama."}
{"text":"After a day of checking out a huge chunk of Toronto on foot and walking up and down the streets of Chinatown, my appetite for baked goods was near fever pitch, so the mere title of Furama Cake and Desserts Garden nearly had me swooning.  We stopped in and after watching how the process works: - grab tray - grab tongs - grab delicious baked goods to put on tray - proceed to counter - pay - nom nom nom  I ended up with a pineapple red bean bun. I'm not at all familiar with Chinese pastries, but I did enjoy my bun. It made me think of donuts."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to spots whenever I visit Chinatown. There is a good selection of pastries, as well as cakes, cookies and sandwiches. One of my personal faves is the mini-BBQ pork buns. I'm also a big fan of as the pineapple-coconut buns and the curried beef pastries.   It's also a great breakfast spot if you're looking for a quick coffee and an inexpensive, freshly baked snack."}
{"text":"I like the products here, especially for their prices. I super appreciate that not everything is jampacked with sugar, the way that many western baked goods are. I also like the idea of using individual tongs and trays, though I can see that for someone who has issues with germs, you could imagine scenarios where people do not use trays and tongs to select their pastries individually. It's also super adorable to see the older patrons sitting around having a social hour over a beverage and a pastry.  However... As has been noted by other reviewers, the people that run the place are moderately racist. If you're having a bad self-esteem day, don't come here, because they probably don't want to serve you unless you are ethnically homogeneous with them."}
{"text":"This is not a bad place to pick up a snack and or a quick lunch. We opted for the latter today and for $8,70 we got  - a small tuna bun - a small ham/cheese bun - a big ham/cheese bun - 2 chicken teriyaki buns - 1 almond cookie  The tuna bun was great. I wish I had gotten the bigger size. I didn't like the ham/cheese bun, however my husband enjoyed his'. The chicken teriyaki bun was OK. I actually didn't eat the bun, but just the chicken.  Again, this bun was well received by my better half.  And then there is the almond cookie. It is ginormous.  It still sitting on my desk and looking at me as I am writing this.  I think I am intimidated. LOL"}
{"text":"On my most recent visit got an egg tart - the tart/shell was overly sweet (like shortbread). I've tried a variety of things here on different occasions, and have never been very impressed. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Extremely inexpensive and authentic Chinese delicacies.  This place is definitely worth peeking your head into and buying a roll (or a dozen) if you're on Spading Ave.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love this HK style bakery since I was young. I visited it very frequently when I lived in downtown. I backed to the bakery recently and they are keep everything good as usual. I love their Teriyaki Chicken Bum, it's so juicy and soft even after one day I heated it up from microwave.  and their bacon green onion Croissant is so amazing!!! Have to try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Pricier than the other bakeries in chinatown, but with more focus on desserts and pastries.  Where you might get 2 for a dollar at Ding Dong or Mashion, here you can expect to pay up to $1.20 per pastry, though they are bigger. I like the creme horns and butterfly pastries, though!"}
{"text":"Good but not as good as Mashion bakery. Also I remember this place as not being as hygienic as other bakeries.... Ie people not using tongs, coughing in open bins etc. Go down the street towards college for Mashion."}
{"text":"Went to pick up a mixed fruit cake, and I've got to say everytime I have been here the service has always been less than stellar.  Listen, I'm not asking for alot.  I went in not sure if I wanted to buy the mixed fruit or strawberry mousse cake.  When I asked what was in the mixed fruit let's just say the answer was 'mixed fruit'.  I assumed there was 'mixed fruit' inside but a bit more specific would have been nice.  Oh yeah, it wasn't an issue of translation because I spoke cantonese.    Unfortunately I had to get a cake from this place, after the person who I was asking decided to leave me and go do something else, I had to flag down the other person working here.  She was a bit more pleasant but I use that term loosely.  Candles are given upon request.  They will put a greeting on a chocolate disk.  In a day and age where there are so many bakeries in chinatown I still don't get why this one is still around.  They definately need some training on customer service"}
{"text":"This place is always busy no matter what time of day you go.  Now, for all you folks that aren`t sure what to do when you go into a place like this, I just followed the previous patrons lead.  Oh yeah, that`s what I did!  Grab  a tra , tongs and go to it!!  This knowledge bodes well for me looking like a pro when I dragged a friend of mine  to try stuff in this place.   What sets me apart from someone that actually knows what stuff is (besides the label, of course) is I have no clue what the items without a label are.  What do you do? I`m too chicken to ask  so my friend and I decide to just try some randomly unlabeled goodies.    They were tasty but when you don`t know if something is going to be savoury or sweet - it is always a shock.  Mad props to anyone who tries anything in an Asian pastry shop that has no label. Be warned this happens often!  What`s life without adventure?  What we had ended up tasting like some sort of donut concoction.  We guessed the other item might be a red bean paste cake thing.  When you want to sit and enjoy your baked goods with a beverage. Note that the ever popular cheap coffee is made with evaporated milk."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to spot by if you're in the area and craving Chinese buns. Everything is self-serve like every other typical Chinese bakery. The good thing is that this place actually very roomy seating unlike the other bakeries. When I was younger I remember my mom coming here and buying my delicious fruit birthday cake and boy, do I miss that."}
{"text":"Not the cheapest place in Chinatown - but the baked goods are decent.  Although, we were fortunate enough to catch a fresh batch of egg tarts still warm to the touch, it was a bit too wet and the crust was soggy.  It's your typical setup in Toronto Chinatown - walk around with a tray and tongs and pick up your own damned pastries and pay afterwards.  Personally - I like Ding Dong more just cuz it's so friggin' cheap -- but Furama just seems cleaner.  But I think I like place because of the 'cafe'/seating area.  It full of old timers sipping milk tea and sitting there for hours because they bought an $0.80 pastry.  Oh - so many of my youthful years were spend in places like this when my dad understood 'look after the kids' as 'hang out with your chef friends, curse, smoke cigarettes, drink milk tea/coffee, eat egg tarts and have little Johnson within an earshot'.  Whenever I am at Furama, I try to make eye contact with one of the kids bored out of their mind as dad/grandpa is nursing a drink and a bun.  I try to telepathically communicate with them... \"Stay strong, kid -- one day, you'll have money to eat all the egg tarts and cake you want, like me... and ya, we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun, too.\""}
{"text":"Treats are pretty good and the price is too. One pastry will range from $.50-$2/3. I love seeing the old Chinese people just chatting away or even playing some Chinese chess. It makes the atmosphere nice.   Hmm. The tables are quite dirty though. The staff make no effort to clean them as they are greasy and have crumbs everywhere.  And the person that was checking out my mom's food looked extremely annoyed at my mom and didn't even crack a smile. But I guess that's normal for Chinese/Vietnamese people because I see that a lot. (hahah dw I'm viet)."}
{"text":"I don't look at reviews and rating before testing out a new place as I feel some yelpers take their contribution to help suggest places of interest a bit to the extreme. So, after eating a ham bun, bbq bun and cream filled bun, I images this place would have high rankings! I recommend this place ask think it produced fresh baked goods compared to the others I visited during my visit."}
{"text":"This was the only Chinese bakery we stopped by on our trip. The u-pick style/set up is GROSS.  In the ideal world, you open a pastry cover, select the biggest, creamiest, or whatever floats your boat bun/tart and close the cover afterwards. In the real world, the pastries are flipped upside down, poked/smashed and literally, I kid you not, ALL the covers were left open (Definitely not for a germaphobic person)!  Some of the buns had familiar names but certainly wasn't the same thing as SF/LA.  Prices, although still budget friendly, was higher than the USA."}
{"text":"Used to come here for Chinese pastries when it was the only one in town. They were good back then. Now, I can't tell the difference between Furama, Dingdong, Mashion. Only difference is that Furama charges 3 times more for the same mediocre buns you can get from other places."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING, the price is perfect. The baked good are delicious and I find myself craving the food quite often. The prices are from $0.50-$3, you can get many pastries for less than $10. The chicken teriyaki in a bun is my favourite and it's $2. I always get like 3, one is filling enough though."}
{"text":"Was searching for a Chinese bakery that sold a quality \"Mixed Fruit Cake\", which is basically white sponge cake with whipped cream and pieces of different kinds of fresh fruit inside and on top. (Melon, strawberries, pineapple, mango, mandarin oranges, etc)  At Furama you need to call 2 hours in advance and the cake will be ready and waiting for you.  The small cake is $15, and the larger 2 lb cake is $20.  Considering the freshness and high quality this is a great deal.  They also added the Happy Birthday chocolate disc and some candles at no charge nice touch!  While there I picked up an egg tart and a BBQ pork bun, both were very tasty and the crust on the egg tart was light and tender, not the frozen type that you get at cheaper places.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at Furama but I've recently converted to Mashion Bakery which has a better selection.  Still, Furama is a reasonable choice when you're looking for Chinese and Vietnamese baked goods and desserts. The items are very picked over towards the end of the day (typical of all bakeries really, so get there early).  I like their egg tarts and the coconut buns are decent too.   They have seating inside and a long counter along the back with fresh cake slices and fruit custard tarts. If you've never tried Asian baked goods before, be aware that they are much less sweet than Western desserts."}
{"text":"most unfriendly waitresses in all toronto.   never go there past 4pm. it is dirty, smells only like cleaning products, and waitresses already decided that their day was over. so you are not wellcome, especially if you do not speak Chinese.  pastries are much better elsewhere by the way. simply, avoid and go to another one. there are now several much better and friendlier ones around."}
{"text":"Learned from yesterday, if you go past 4pm you risk smelling chemical cleaning products and not seeing their food and price labels.  Went again today but at 1:45pm, on a very cold day (-3c before wind chilld) and round-trip back to the office. Let the food settle in the red box at room temperature for 30-60mins before multiple tasting. My verdict without microwaving or heating the buns below:  Great pineapple buns and ham/cheese buns. Taste is above average.  The curry beef or bbq pork puff pastries (Cha Siu So) are not nearly as good though (far too less filling). Curry beef filling tastes better but can use more filling. Butter roll is average. Haven't tried their other buns yet. 3.5 out of 5 rating for the buns I've tried only...  This place is definitely better than Mashion Bakery nearby. I bought identical items yesterday night from both places and everything at Furama was better, although more expensive."}
{"text":"This is my usual stop when I am in Toronto. Nothing like getting a dozen Chinese pastries for less than $15. Some items are hit and miss here but overall it brings me memories when I stop in and see the trays and tongs and all the bulk pastries waiting to be picked. Coming here always reminds me the times my family would stop here during our many visits to Toronto and notably the visit to Chinatown.   The items range from $0.80 to $1.20 per pice. You pick the items on a try and the clerk somehow calculates it all very quickly while stuffing them into a box. The service can be awful here as they barely greet you.   Love seeing the groups of old men who gather at the tables in the early morning and chat away."}
{"text":"\"The fancy Chinese Bakery\" on Spadina.   Your order will either come in a white cardboard box, or a paper bag.   Another thing to consider, is that it is more expensive than the others. However! They have some unique more European-style pastries here!  Cream puffs, french horns, fruit cups, etc.  Also, they have \"kaya\" buns! I say \"kaya\" because they taste suspiciously like ordinary custard buns... They taste great though!"}
{"text":"dare i say, the best bakery in Toronto. the quality and flavor of most of the treats here, is on a completely new level from any of the other bakeries Ive been to, in and around Toronto. all sorts of different treats and goodies here, which change sometimes on a seasonal basis.  the staff are super friendly and helpful.  this place is super clean, and leave the car at home, cause parking is a pain."}
{"text":"Saw a typical Toronto cockroach waltzing around on some of the buns in the middle aisle. For those who don't care about that sort of thing, this place is fine. Egg tarts can be bizarrely oily at the bottom. Cash only."}
