{"text":"Great restaurant  They over load the plates and reasonably priced  My only problem is the restaurant freezes up when someone opens the door It would of been 5 stars otherwise"}
{"text":"Great lamb Gyro. Awesome English speaking waiter. The gyro was the best testing I have ever had. Meat was so good it felt like I was demeaning it putting it in a sandwich.  My only knock is the size. I could have had two and I like lettuce on mine. The french fries are cool but I wouldn't have missed them if they weren't there.  If/when I go back to Montreal, Cone is a definite stop.  Sooo tasty. They know what their doing!"}
{"text":"Overall a pretty good experience, it is worth going if you are in the area. The gyros have French fries in then which i was not expecting, but they turned out to be pretty good. Not that much to say really though. The water tasted kinda funky, but that could just be the local tap. Service was pretty good but they weren't many others in the restaurant when I was there."}
{"text":"Le personnels est très gentil! On a essayé les gyros au poulet, tres bon, bcp de poulet mais manque un peu de sauce."}
{"text":"Got their delivery flyer from a local grocery store in the area and figured I would try it as local spots like Elatos and Village Greque have always been good to us. My girlfriend liked the Lamb Gyro but my Chicken pita was quite undercooked, the psilokomeni salad was overly salted and uneadable because of it and the \"potatoes\" were simply french fries. When we called to tell them my pita was undercooked she defended the fact that they just cook their meat and no more as to avoid drying it out, we'll let me tell you that it was taken off the grill far too early and I'm quite sure the souvlaki chicken is frozen chicken as well. I'll stick with my Elatos Souvlaki as they are always spot on :)"}
{"text":"Dinner Saturday night with 2 other friends. The place was full but the staff was very accommodating and they setup a table in just a few minutes. We ordered the meat platter for 4 people. It came with chicken, pork, and lamb gyro slices, greek sausage, home fries, lots of salade and a couple of dipping sauces. The lamb and chicken gyro was not very good. The chicken was tasteless, the lamb was over cooked and had a very heavy lamb smell which usually indicates that it was not fresh. On the other hand the sausage and pork were very good.  Lots of people are raving about the lamb, unfortunately I didn't have a good experience and my sister which had dined there a month earlier agrees with me.  We did have a very nice evening thanks to the friendly staff. Thank you Irene and Voula, you guys are great."}
