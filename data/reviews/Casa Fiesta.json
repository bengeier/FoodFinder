{"text":"Phenomenal food!! Very fresh ingredients, great selections. We ordered chicken chimi, steak burrito and tacos. The burrito was absolutely HUGE!! This is the best Mexican food I've had in a long time!!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at. The tacos are large and very fresh. The beans and the rice are to die for and they always give you warm chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Great food! $1 tacos on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The salsa is good, too. Just be prepared to go through the tiny drive thru."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've had since I moved away from Texas 2 years ago! Authentic and big portions! What a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"If taste is your first priority this is the place!! The best tacos I've ever had in my life came from here!!    It's a small take out restaurant with a drive thru for easy pick up, and the service is always friendly and super fast.  We eat here at least twice a month and the food is consistently delicious.  Steak tacos are my favorite! The steak is well seasoned, still juicy and grilled to perfection! They also have the best thin and crispy chips and the fresh salsa has a little heat that I love.    If you are looking for a quick and tasty lunch or dinner definitely give this place a shot!  Check them out on Facebook to see specials."}
{"text":"I appreciate this Mexican venue.   The al pastor is delicious.   I appreciate the owners up beat attitude to his customers.    Salsa is homemade and good."}
