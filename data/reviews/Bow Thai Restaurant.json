{"text":"I have been here several times to eat, and yesterday is my last because I found plastic in my curry AGAIN! This is the second time I found plastic, another time was in the authentic pad Thai. The manager didn't even offer to give it away for free."}
{"text":"Bow thai has the best pad thai in North York!"}
{"text":"I thought that the food here was pretty good, pretty authentic, and the prices are really good. The atmosphere is pretty hurting though, when I was there it was myself and Nicole M. as the only patrons in the restaurant for about half an hour or forty-five minutes. The staff is really nice, even if not exactly a professional wait staff. They also serve tall boys of Tiger, which is a win."}
{"text":"Food is reasonable. Tasty at times and average at times. I go there coz its the closest Thai place to my house."}
{"text":"Generous portions. Well marinated/spiced skewers. Lychee shake is surprisingly good. I have no expertise in thai food, but this is pretty good food in general."}
{"text":"Decent food, slow delivery on takeout. Have found a better place, but overall decent. If I was craving Thai while strolling on Queen East, would probably go again... But won't be racing back."}
{"text":"My favourite Thai restaurant outside of downtown since I came back from Thailand. Bow Thai has fantastic delivery and a quiet, classy dining room experience. Their delivery is great value and if you order directly (instead of going through online), you'll find that they'll offer free spring rolls for an order above $25, or Pad Thai above $40. The portions are massive (especially the Pad Thai, which shouldn't be eaten by a single person).

The dining room is a little small, but the area won't have a lot of diners so you'll likely get a seat. Great service because they won't sit more than 20 or so people. Food is even better in-restaurant with attention paid to presentation. I've had many of their curries and love their Cashew Nut Chicken and Me-Goring.

Definitely come here if you're in North York, of if you're passing by Leslie on the 401."}
{"text":"Everything is good, especially the curry pad Thai and authentic pad Thai if you like your noodles a bit sweeter"}
{"text":"As someone who just came back from Thailand after a while abroad and ate only local food I can say this is a solid spot that is very easy on the wallet.

My girlfriend and I had the very large appetizer plate for $15.95 which as loaded with some spring rolls, fried calamari, peanut satay shrimp (so tender), 3 solid dips, and the best mango salad I've had in Toronto. 

We also had Singha beer which is a light beer along the lines of Canadian that comes from Thailand. $4.50 a bottle while domestics were $3.50. For the Beaches area that is very cheap.

My main course was a chicken and vegetable dish with sticky rice while my girlfriend has glass noodles with grilled shrimp and she loved it.

They do need to change the music as they played one traditional Thai tune on repeat for the whole time but it was rather comical as opposed to being annoying. The Thai ice tea is also good so you should try it, definitely what they drink back home.

If you want to spend more money than go elsewhere over there as there are 3 other Thai joints around but we'll be going back here as the food was solid and the service was very swift as well."}
{"text":"I called to make a delivery and there were a few problems. First, I asked for the pad thai to be medium spicy and it was not the least bit spicy when I got it. It took an hour and a half to get the delivery. OH AND, the menu that I got in the mail on the same day had outdated prices apparently because everything I ordered was more expensive than the menu. Terrible service. Terrible food."}
{"text":"Small place that we mostly get takeout from and dine in occasionally. The curries are good and the coconut chicken soup is great.. . Creamy and tasty. Very decent prices and usually get something free with over $25 order"}
{"text":"This place was disgusting. I went with my mom and ordered the shrimp pad Thai and mango salad. The pad thai was horrible.  The shrimps were practically raw and the noodles were soggy and genuinely tasted poor. My mom at least enjoyed the mango salad. Will never visit again. I'll give it 2 stars only because I wasn't charged for the pad thai."}
{"text":"What a surprise, I wondered in to this little restaurant at 3:30 pm for late lunch and had a fabulous dining experience. Although I only sampled two dishes and rice, I was overwhelmed by the authentic flavours and freshness of the food. 

The Red Curry Chicken was creamy and spicy with a nice surprise of assorted veg. The Pad Woon Sen was plentiful and delicious.  I will definitely  go back, the food was great and the staff friendly and courteous. Give them a try, I don't think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day. What I like most about this place is that the food is definitely made to order every time so it's fresh and the presentation is always nice. There are healthy vegetarian options too which I like. We got a free dessert for Mother's Day which I thought was nice of them. Overall good place for good Thai food."}
{"text":"Really impressed with this place.

Had the Green currie, spring rolls, satay shrimp  and mango salad!!

ALL WERE GREAT!!! Highly recommend the Green Currie & Satay Shrimp!!

Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Reading Alex T's review had be laughing quite hard. Ridiculous is the correct adjective.

I came to pick up my dry cleaning, and caught this place at the corner of my eye. A Thai restaurant here?
Jerusalem restaurant's portions are enormous, and I wasn't about to go to the pizza nova, so I popped in for a quick bite. 
\"Hi, take out or for here?\" The waitress asked me.
The restaurant was so freaking small, there was no possibility that I was going to lunch here. My demands were simple, after scanning through the menu I ordered the red curry chicken with rice, soup and spring roll lunch special, with a side order of samosa? 
The lady wearing a track suit offered me a glass of lime water while I waited. During my 8 minute wait for the food, someone came in with a gift bag offering it to the owner, introduced himself as an associate from some trash collecting company. For a moment there was confusion between the restaurant staff and said associate because nobody could answer anyone's questions. 
\"Who's the owner?\"
\"I don't know, who's your owner?\"
\"I don't know.\"
There was sketches of bamboo on one wall, and miscellaneous sketches on the other. It looked as if the place could hold no more than 20 patrons. I came here around 3pm, and it was completely empty. But I doubt it would become buzzing considering that it is almost hidden at the very corner of the plaza. I just don't see the reason why anyone would open a Thai restaurant here. There's really no demands for it in this area.

I got home with my food, and realised that the rice and other dishes came in round bowls of styrofoam. Jamaican rice was just normal rice, the RED curry chicken I ordered ended up as green curry. How in the world can they get my order wrong? I was the only person in the bloody restaurant! I even heard the waitress reiterate to the chefs in the back that it was to be red curry. She spoke Thai, but I distinctly heard her repeated the words 'red curry'. This was a catastrophic failure of infinite magnitude. The spring roll was completely tasteless, so I had to bathe it in the plum sauce it came with. There were a total of six pieces of samosas. Small and dry. I'm pretty sure samosas aren't Thai. 
I wasn't horribly dissatisfied with everything, but I was certainly anything but impressed. 

How could they have gotten my order wrong...HOW?!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for lunch. Good value for money. As they have lunch specials which include mains plus mango salad/soup plus a spring roll. The taste of food is okay, nothing to rave about. I wouldn't come here for dinner or bring a friend visiting. OK for casual dining if you dont feel like cooking."}
{"text":"We visit at least a couple of times a year and are never disappointed. Family favourites are BBQ beef, purple garden, basil shrimp and spicy Thai fried. Deliciously spicy - on a cold night especially!"}
{"text":"I reviewed on yelp and went to Bow Thai for trial. It was average.I ordered coconut chicken soup but  did not liked it at all so after one sip I asked her to take it back and requested not to charge me so manager agreed but I had to make another purchase so I tried pad Thai spicy noodles chicken which was good. Service was good no doubt! But I am now scared of trying something new. :) here is a soup picture as you may like coconut with lime:"}
{"text":"Craving some good spicy Asian food, my wife and I popped into this place later in the evening. We were the only ones in the restaurant which was a surprise as the food is really good. For starters we ordered the fried tofu and a plate of Thai fish cakes. The tofu had a nice crisp exterior and a soft squishy inside, just right. The fish cakes were quite dense with strong hints of coriander and lemongrass. 

We ordered a chicken green curry and a pork and eggplant stir-fry. The curry was great, full of rich, spicy flavourful gravy and nice chunks of chicken and potatoes. The stir fry was good also a nice rounded dish with great slices of Aubergine nicely fried to soft consistency. 

This is a nice little Thai place and one I will visit again when I am in the beaches."}
{"text":"Got a huge takeout order and sampled a lot of different dishes. Yes, you have to order rice separately if you get curry. Deal with it. Lots of Thai places do that. At least you get to pick between white, brown, coconut, or sticky rice. They also have rice noodles as an option. If you've never had Panang curry on noodles (aka the infamous secret menu item \"Thai Islamic Noodles\" from Salad King), you should try it!

Favourites:
Curry Fried Rice (Nasi Goreng Neyalan) - The curry powder they use has a lot of coriander in it. It reminds me of fresh, homemade Malaysian curry. 
Thick Curry (Beef) - Like a Panang curry, it's basically the Red Curry with peanuts added to thicken it. 
Shrimp Satay - Part of the appetizer sample platter. Shrimp is skewered with pineapple chunks and seasoned with Malaysian curry powder. Very flavourful. 

Least Favourites:
Samosa - The flavour of the filling and the pastry were good, but I didn't like the mushy consistency of the potato. It was mashed into a smooth puree.
Fresh Rolls - The rice wrapper seemed quite thick, and the dish felt like it needed shrimp or something in addition to the veggies and tofu.

Also had:
Spring Rolls - Pretty good, reminded me of good Chinese veggie spring rolls. 
Calamari - The flavour was good, and the squid was very tender.
Beef Salad - Never had this before and wanted to try. The beef was a little overdone for my taste.
Authentic Pad Thai - Wrapped in a paper-thin egg crepe that you break open to eat. When they say authentic they mean it's not that bright red, sweet Pad Thai that is more common in Toronto. It's more brown and salty (in a good way). 
Red Curry (Chicken) - Standard Red Curry, with lots of carrot, broccoli, and bok choy. 
Malay Curry (Chicken) - Really liked the flavour. Like a mix between golden and red curry.

Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Not even close to authentic Thai food. The pad thai was burnt. Would not even recommend it to anyone. I had ordered via Uber Eats. Only the Uber delivery was OK."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I accidentally stumbled upon this restaurant. We wanted to grab a quick bite during our 1 hour lunch break and let me tell you that they were quick with bringing out our orders. This place was decent and service was ok. This place offers lunch specials, which includes soup/spring roll or mango salad with an entree for $8.95. I had the beef green curry. Good flavour and a generous portion. I have had been Thai food elsewhere, but this is good enough for a fast lunch."}
{"text":"I order last week curry padthai and pad sew for take out but as soon we got home... my curry pad thai taste like regular padthai...  but the food still taste good."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out and were underwhelmed. Nothing was outright bad, let alone terrible (well, we did find a staple in the fried tofu box, I guess), but nothing was terrific either.  There were a couple of below average dishes, some average ones.  

I don't think we're likely to order again from here without something prompting us to do so."}
{"text":"Service is friendly and interesting. 
Food quality is good and best value
Small but clean.  good for small group Thai restaurant. You may wonder umm.. interesting ....what do you mean interesting.

Sure here we go
We three guests, ordered first appetizer fresh rolls to start with some drinks. Then we decided to add more the food and ordered 2 more dishes (noodles and curry) the reason we ordered this way because we are told ' we have to order more things because special dinner for 2 will not be enough for three'. 
Pls note that we did ordered appetizer already to start with.

Anyways. In order to maintain my very pleasant and relaxed mood on this Friday , we took the lady owner suggestion and ordered two entrees separately instead of special for 2 combo."}
{"text":"I've had an okay experience at Bow Thai, but friends have not been impressed.  For god's sake, go to Thai House a few blocks east, which is the best Thai in the city."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous! We ordered Spicy seafood, Red curry and Thai Ice tea from Justeat. Delivery took over an hour and IT DOESNT COME WITH RICE! $14 CURRY, NO RICE! Any human being eat curry without rice??????? [insert Nick Young ??? face here] Oh by the way, you need to order steamed rice separately and it cost $1.5. Worst experience EVERRRRRRRRRR"}
{"text":"I guess I was one of the lucky ones.  Had an appointment near by and haven't been in this little strip mall in eons.  The last time I was here a few years ago, this location was still a KFC.  So that's how small this place is.

For under $10 including tax and tip, it sure beat other fast food options.    I put Bow Thai in the pan-asian-sauce-from-a-can+protein category.  (a la Mr Thai, Matsu Japanese and Thai --- or one of many restaurants that throw in the word blank and Thai).

Essentially its dump everything into a wok, add the sauce, throw it on a bed of carbs and voila.  Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it's not a slave all day prep and cook authentic experience that you might get at say Suhko or Khao San.  

Anyways, I had a super friendly server, food got to me correctly almost instantaneously, albeit there were only two other tables.  Had the lunch special with cashew chicken.  Got the hot and sour soup with a spring roll right away, and before I even finished that my main arrived.

Hopefully, they've cleaned up their act from previous services as described.  

I'll be back another time and see how it goes."}
{"text":"good place. good food. are they perect no? but they provide good service, good food 
yelp is the only review side where they have a low review! look at other sites."}
{"text":"Did take out through Just Eats.  Food quality was awful. The Tom Yam was just some lemongrass broth with boiled chicken. The Mee gorang was nasty and smelt 3 days old. The Malay curry was watered down nonsense. I don't want to know how long that stuff has been in the fridge but it was just reheated and sent out for delivery. Nothing fresh here for take out.  Stay away from this joint"}
{"text":"If you are looking for some delicious and good quality PAD THAI, come and check out Bow Thai! 

I have been here twice and the quality of food has not gone down. 

Its a small restaurant and can be very busy, so make sure to put a reservation in advance. Lots of parking lot and very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed by this place. I've given it a second chance after an unsatisfied meal there( they forgot my food and by the time my food came all my friends were already done eating). Well I was in the neighbourhood and went to have lunch there. There were four of us and two of us were unsatisfied with our food. My friend had ordered a pad thai. The pad thai was way overly salted. We all tried a bite of it to confirm his taste buds were accurate. The thing was so salty I could've eaten rice with it. He told the waitress that he wasn't satisfied with his food. Then funny things started to happen. 

The chef came out of the kitchen and asked if everything was okay. We thought, what a nice gesture! 
My friend explained his concern. 
The chef then says now I'm telling you these are his exact words
\" No I think the pad thai is not too salty. I cook(this) all the time and no one says they don't like. \"
My friend explained other than the saltiness it doesn't have the hint of sourness that most pad Thais do. 
The chef goes to the other table. Takes another customers finished plate of pad thai. Brings it over and says \"look he finished it and he thinks it's good. \" now everyone is shocked, including the table across from us. 
We said you know what? Maybe the pad thai is just not his thing. Can he change it to the green curry instead?

The answer is no. As its not his problem that a customer doesn't like his food. 
Terrible terrible service. And food quality for that matter. 

If you find this review slightly humorous, do yourself a favour and don't come. There are way better thai restaurants than this one"}
{"text":"Wow, these people mixed up my order as well. I had previously given them a good review, but forget it - I'm done with them. The price is fine, but they just throw chili peppers all over green curry--turning it into a burning hot red curry! When I called the woman to complain, she just kept telling me over and over \"just don't order it extra spicy\"-- but there's no such option either way on their site. 

Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I went to try it with my boyfriend after work and it's really terrible! We picked mild curry but when we ate it, it was so spicy. Plus the weird thing is when you order curry they do not come with rice, you need to add 1 buck to get the rice. That just does not make any sense to me at all. Can you find a person just eat curry for dinner without rice or noodles? The interior is nothing special at all. We feel we got ripped off. And when we are home we drink a lot of water and eat some ice cream cause we feel our throat is burning so badly."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: Modern with a touch of Thai ethnic paintings & carvings.

Food & service: Staff is friendly.

We have been here a few times and their food has been superb.

I'm surprised at the 1 star ratings this place has received especially for things like 'rice is not included' or 'too spicy' Most places don't include rice and curries will be made mildly spiced if you ask them. You need to have the ability to handle the mild spice.
This restaurant is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times. Good combos. Curries are delicious. The sticky rice goes very well with the curry. If you order take out you can get a discount on the bill or a free pad Thai (not sure if this is a limited time deal)."}
{"text":"Place is clean and pretty. Had the spicy veggie and Tofu , although great, way too many noddles, however that may be great for some and it seams to be a common Thai thing. I will  be back to try the rest of the vegetarian dishes, since this place is  so close to home. The deep fried veggie spring rolls were good except it had a bit of a fishy after taste from the oil. I'm assuming that they fry their calamari in that same oil as the spring rolls. I will never order the  rolls again. Coconut rice was to die for. First time trying this. Amazing!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"This place is a horror story, unless you like horror stories I would recommend staying far, far away from this place.

Everyone else's reviews are right, they can not get anything right! 

Ordered an appetizer which came out undercooked. 

Ordered two main dishes, one comes and the other did not...

Wait 20 minutes and the other one still hasn't arrived!

People who ordered take out received their order before our second dish arrived... 

Best of all they want you to pay for food that hasn't come! 

The place is just a mistake. Do yourself a favor, stay away."}
{"text":"I actually quite liked this place. Both times I went there I ordered the Pad-Thai which I found to be scrumptrulescent. Granted, it was my first time ever trying Pad Thai so my feelings of adoration may be based somewhat in nostalgia.

Regardless the atmosphere is pleasant enough and the waitresses were quite friendly. I recommend. Not a bad joint at all."}
{"text":"Was so impressed after the first time I went there and ate the spicy fish that I am a regular now. Very polite and humble staff, decent prices and extremely good food. Fast service and accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Food is so so, portion not that big and it's on the pricy side. Coconut rice was different as it was soggy.
Fried rice was the star but oily

Recommend this place? Not really"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative reviews.  We have been here three times over the last three years or so. The reason we don't come that often is that it's not too close to where we live.

As vegetarians I appreciate that they are willing to make everything pure vegetarian without any fish/shrimp paste. Most other Thai restaurants either can't or don't do this or worse aren't honest about this.

Each of their veggie curries is distinctive and has its own flavour. We ordered red green and Malaysian curries - each was excellent. Finally you don't need to order just plain rice - I ordered rice noodle which was a really nice option. we also had coconut rice and brown rice. Yes we had to pay 2-3 dollars for the rice and noodles but that's standard for TO area Thai places.

Again I can't comment on others negative reviews - but if you are vegetarian this place rocks."}
{"text":"Ive ordered delivery here many times and they were always polite and very quick to deliver. They give you free spring rolls on an order over $20 or free pad thai on $40 over. I love their green mango salad and the mango shake. So good."}
{"text":"Downhill significantly last visit.  Prices have increased.  My order was well prepared but I asked for beef in the dish and got shrimp.  An order of Mussaman curry had way too much tamarind paste to the point of being really sour and an order of fried rice with Chinese broccoli had far too little greens and undercooked rice."}
{"text":"This restaurant has won its place back onto my \"fav place to eat' list. I been here couple years ago and although, owners been switched over time it seems they were still able to maintain a consistency of keeping some of the dishes as traditional and authentic compare to other Thai places. 

This restaurant located inside a plaza besides the Jerusalem Restaurant. Still loved the name of the restaurant \"Bow Thai\". How cute, creative and genius is that?

I was here with a couple of friends. We ordered a set dinner for two with few options provided for 2 appetizer and 2 main. I forgot about the price but it was a fairly good deal and portion size was decent. Mango salad, Malaysian rice with chicken and red curry with chicken and coconut rice (additional cost) was picked out for the set meal. The mango salad was surprisingly good. Usually I'm not a huge fan of it due to many times I find the mango is too sour and texture is too hard but this one is just right. The mango is sweet - has a bit of crunch inside and the sauce is tangy, fresh and not overly sour. It's a really good dish for start. The Red Curry was really good! It definitely has a tomato base inside as it is how it should be. The spices is just right and creamy. The coconut rice was really good. This is the whole reason why my friend suggested to come. I never really order with coconut rice but I could see why people go crazy with it. I suppose every restaurant makes it slightly differently. This one they mixed it with sweet coconut milk. It smells soo good and trust me you'll be fine just eating it alone. 

The rest of the dishes were Green Curry with chicken and coconut rice, shrimp & chicken Pad Thai and Malaysian curry with beef and rice. I was very disappointed at the green curry. I still thinks Thai Basil is the best compare to others I've tried. This one has its creaminess from the coconut milk but the spice isn't enough to give it an extra kick to it.. The pad Thai was really good! I will definitely go back again just for that. Besides this restaurant, I don't think I've had it anywhere else. The uniqueness of it is the omelette egg overlay on top of the pad Thai. When you eat it together, it makes the dish much creamier. There's also chopped peanuts on the side to mix in. 

Overall, it was a good experience. I will definitely come back again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"You would think a given at restaurants would be to get orders right.  I've been here twice now (once dining in, another delivery) and both times Bow Thai has managed to get my order wrong.  Do I ever dare go once more with \"3 times a charm\" in mind?

Pros:  
Food is prepared relatively quick
Prices are pretty fair compared to the rest of the market

Cons:
Can't seem to get orders correct
Food is nothing special, pretty forgettable.

I can't stress the getting orders right part.  I don't know if there's miscommunication between waitress and cook staff or what not, but it's not a hard process right?  This should be something every place gets right.

The first time we dined in, one of the orders was a green curry.  It came out a red curry.  Being there, it was easy to just let them know it was supposed to be green and they made the change for us.  The second time though, I ordered delivery.  It was a peanut lamb dish and a spicy beef one as well.  Delivery was pretty prompt and within 45 minutes IRCC.  However, I was amazed to find that I got a spicy beef and a spicy lamb.  I have no idea what they were thinking..  Why would they think someone would order two dishes of the same variety like that?  Being it was a delivery, the driver was long gone before we even found out.  My roommate and I just didn't want to bother with it in the end and just ate what we had.

I have read other reviews on this place online and getting orders wrong seems to be commonplace with the restaurant.  Pretty rediculous really..

The food itself is nothing special.  Nothing jumps out at you and you always have the I've had better feeling.  It's not bad, but you won't be telling your friends about it anytime soon.  Not getting what you want half the time doesn't help either.

I know I'm completely bashing this place right now, but orders should be done correctly honestly.  This should be a given.  The food is made pretty quickly and nothing seems overpriced at all.  It's just the bad outweighs the good by a lot here.  I really don't think I'll take a chance on the third try myself either."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai place I've been to in Toronto. Delivery is fast, large portions and fresh food. Samosas is a must try if you go"}
{"text":"3.5/5 stars actually. We got take out from here which we picked up. The food was good. But some items I thought were overpriced. One example is the Tamarind Salmon dish. It's 17.99 for a very small amount of fish. Plus there were some large bones in the pieces of deep fried salmon. The coconut shrimp appetizer was really good though, and the fried rice with vegetables and tofu. Some of the other dishes were too oily for my taste (Cashew Chicken, Ginger Chicken). Other dishes were too dry for my taste (Satay Appetizer, BBQ Beef). They don't seem to do anything halfway. Not sure if I would order from them again. Maybe their food is better eaten at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I just ordered from there. The food is so bad I am considering call my credit card to cancel. I've never been so peeved over bad food. 

I ordered vegetable red curry and shrimp red curry. It is clear that they served me the left over. The curry was all sauce, like soup, with two table spoons of veggie in one and shrimp in the other. It was gross, and I cannot get the nasty taste out of my throat. 

In the veggie curry, there as supposed to be baby corn, all I got was the tiny ends almost 1/2\"; and when I say end, I really mean the small tip of the baby corn. It was dry and old. I've never tasted carrots like this. I'm still not convince that it was carrots. It looked like carrot, it tasted like a sponge (I imagined that's what a sponge would taste like). All the veggies were dried, dehydrated, old.

The shrimp was also dried, dehydrated, old.

Can you tell I am p*ssed? It goes without saying I would never ordered there again.

Gross! Nasty! Don't order. I WAN'T MY MONEY BACK!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would not say Bow Thai Restaurant is an Authentic Thai restaurant. But more a reasonably priced neighbourhood restaurant.

Portion size is good and you get good value for your money. Small family owned and managed.

Th usual pad thai and curry both pretty solid choice."}
{"text":"Although I have no complaints about the food, the service and management of this place is downright horrible and disorganized. They made us wait more than 1 hour after taking our order... On mothers day. Nearly ruined our evening. 

Although I understand mother's days can be really busy, and long lines might be expected but not atrocious post-order service. After speaking to the manager he basically tried to brush us off as he was \"busy\" (unfortunately due to his own inability to staff up and run the restaurant properly) and when I insisted on speaking it resulted in him saying was more interested in making money than compensating us for the trouble, so I encourage everyone to STAY AWAY from this place, if nothing else than to not support poor business ethics. Customers always come first... especially if one of the customers is a mother and it's mother's day."}
{"text":"We had the pad Thai and a veggie dish. Portion size was on the bigger side, good flavour profile, fresh ingredients, food on point, good amount of heat but not too spicy. The service was amazing, very attentive and they allowed us to alter the dish due to a dietary restriction and the host was ever so nice. Love this place. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch today. Had one of the lunch specials, red curry with chicken. They have quite a number of choices for their lunch specials, and all of them are $8.99 including either a mango salad or a soup plus a springroll. The soup was a hot & sour soup and it tasted mediocre at best. As for the main entrée, there were about 5 pieces of chicken with lots of vegetables (with the majority being carrot slices that are more for aesthetics). The jasmine rice on the side was definitely cooked with too much water, very soft and did not blend well with the curry. The red curry though tasted pretty good. The best thing about it was that contrary to most asian restaurants, you don't leave with a mouthful of MSG, so that was a thumbs up. 

As for service, they were not very attentive. We asked for water refills for at least 4 times before we got it. 

All in all, food was mediocre and service was minimal."}
