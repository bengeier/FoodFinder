{"text":"Last weekend we checked out their Sunday Brunch.  They had your standard fair eggs, bacon and sausage.  As well as yogurts, cereal and fruit.  What made the brunch really good was the assortment of hot dishes they had also. Prime Rib at the carving station.   The dessert table was oh so delicious."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch over a year ago, was very happy with the selection so I've always been excited to go back for round 2. Finally got the right opportunity with Easter Brunch!  We didn't have a reservation but they were extremely accommodating with our walk-in request with minimal wait time. All staff were very nice and on point. Not overly crowded but sometimes you're in a bit of a line. The buffet itself has a great selection of everything from savory to sweet. They even had a number of action stations (ham, prime rib, risotto, omelette). The food is mostly breakfast but they have some other great options as well like pasta and vegetables. Great Hors d'oeuvre section that lots of people overlooked, lots of premium items here! By far my favorite part was the dessert of course lol. Pigged out here and enjoyed every bit of it! Pudding, cheesecake, chocolate cake, fruit w/ chocolate fondo, macaroons and more! Awesome dessert selection. Pretty conventional buffet and not overwhelming, could use a few more unique items if I'm being nit picky but honestly the majority wouldn't be disappointed. Price is right for what you get, not great if you're a 1 plate and stuffed kind of person lol. I definitely had my monies worth and then some though! Really enjoyed it and I'll be back in time."}
{"text":"Quiet place for lunch.  The  food is average, order was a little off.  My friend asked no bacon but it was all over the salad.  Why does Cobb salad come with a raspberry vinaigrette dressing?  I had the Thai wonton soup which was average as well.  It was expected from a hotel restaurant but being the only people eating here they really should be able to get your order right."}
