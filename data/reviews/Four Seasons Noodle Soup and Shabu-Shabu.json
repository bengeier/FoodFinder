{"text":"That's the best Japanese restaurant I ever went. Everything was super. The place was very clean, the waiter was very nice too, we ordered the family combo for 2, which was good quantity and quality, they even got us chicken teriyaki on the house for my little one. The food was really tasty and fresh. All over it was excellent experience, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars/5   A hidden gem. One of the best pork bone soups I have ever tried. A lot better than the Owl of Minerva which I feel is hit or miss each time. The beef soon tofu also had a good taste.  Service is a bit slow and it's a standard Korean restaurant. Nothing special about decor.  Just come for the food."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here several times and it has been consistently a good experience. I've tried the shabu shabu, various noodle dishes, dumplings and the japchae. Everything is pretty solid, the dumplings in particular are great. The shabu shabu for 2 gives large portions as well.  The decor is cute and homey, the service has always been good. The old asian woman who is sometimes there is very sweet.   The only thing I've noticed is that they don't give as many side dishes as they used too. They used to give marinated yams, pickled potatoes, radishes, kimchi, bean sprouts, tofu, seaweed, etc but now you'll usually just get 3 or 4."}
{"text":"It's our first time here and we expect the food will be good based on overall four star reviews.  Unfortunately, food quality is very bad. We ordered salmon teriyaki and it come with two pieces with different colors - one seemed to be steamed first before grilled (with pale color) and the other one seems to be grilled only (with orange color). The taste was awful.  We also ordered cucumber roll and the sushi rice is icy cold with no hint of vinegar. The rice seem to be from last night or even longer. We ordered dumping noodles soup and that tastes ok. During order, we learned that the management just changed, not sure if that's the reason why the food quality goes down or so. The staff is friendly, yet the place is hot and there are flies flying around.  Definitely not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I truly love this place. I couldn't stop thinking or talking about it even after my meal. We had the seafood shabu shabu for 2 which was $32 before tax and totally worth it. We also ordered the dumplings for $9 which was also delicious.   The seafood shabu shabu comes with around 5-7 different types of seafood. It also comes with a heckload of at least 10 different kinds of vegetables that you can add more servings if you want. The stock is extremely flavourful and by the end of the meal we were all about to burst from the fullness.   The service is pretty good. They waiters will come ask if you need anything a few times and there is a bell you can press to call them over. The restaurant also plays relaxing music and is pretty quiet.   My family and I will definitely come here again soon."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Hate to give this authentic Korean owned - Japanese/Korean restaurant a 1 star, but I had to - based on my first experience...  Live 2 minutes away and thought I'd give this place a try on a Friday night.   The moment we walked in, took a while to be seated especially if there were seats that weren't occupied. We only saw 1 waiter who's the hostess and also serving food/ taking order. The owners (husband and wife I'm assuming) were hiding in the back where the chefs prepared the sushi, neither of the two came to seat us.   Finally the waiter spotted us at the front, the same waiter who was running around serving customers came to seat us. We weren't given any water or tea until we asked for it. Another 2 couple infront of us also had to ask for water/tea before it was served.   Food took \"forever\" to come. We ordered a pork bone soup (way too salty), sushi R7 (decent tasting), and a chicken katsu (took nearly 30-40mins after the pork bone soup was served).   It's kind of ironic how the Korean standard appetizers came last after waiting for so long.   The waiter was nice and kept on apologizing for the wait time and said she would give us a discount and to remind her.  Got our bill and there weren't any discount given. She answered, \" I've asked for the discount but my boss said no. Let me ask again for the discount\". I didn't like the response. After waiting forever for the food to come and complaining how salty the pork bone soup was, the owner said no discount? After she took the bill back, and reprinted the receipt, I then see the 10% discount.   The owner greeted the Korean customers with extra care and respect. Other guests who did not complain about the food, the owner would lead them to the front door saying \"thank you, have a great day\". When it was our turn to leave, nothing was said. We weren't even acknowledged. The owner didn't bother coming over when they were 5 steps away from our table.  Would I come back? DEFINITELY NOT. The service was not what I expected and could be 10000x better."}
{"text":"Very yummy Shabu for dinner. At least 11 kinds of vegetables with the beef Sharbel options, which is $28 for two servings. we also ordered the clam noodle which was yummy with lots of clams. Service was friendly and fast. The space is cozy and clean. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"We had the beef shabu for 2 for $28 before tax & tip. It was a large portion of vegetables with some beef, and it comes with a choice of noodles OR porridge.  They also have a lunch menu with your typical bento options such as kalbi, teriyaki, I think bulgogi? etc.  By the way, the front of the store doesn't say \"Four Seasons\" in English. It says SHIKI SUSHI (?? sìjì or shiki which means 4 seasons)."}
{"text":"I've tried their knife cut noodle soup with clams which they specialize for and its very mediocre at best.   I've had their sushi boats and that isn't really special either.  Nothing really stands out here but it's nice to have a Korean restaurant in Richmond Hill. There's a lack of Korean restaurants north of Steeles so this is an okay option for those who live in the area and don't want to go down south.   The owner is pretty pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Autumn, a season that transitions from Shiki Sushi {old} into Four Seasons . A cool snowy season to wave Sushi you later [AYCE] and welcome the Noodle. We stand upon an image (Shiki logos on the windows) of what once was Shiki,  now bestowed anew (New menu of mostly Korean food with Shabu Shabu).  If memory serves, an authentic Japanese Shabu Shabu I have not yet enjoyed. As I encountered this, my first Japanese Korean-ish Shabu Shabu I'm amazed. Not by the volume in comparison to nearby Hotpots of Chinese, but by the freshness, the variety and simplicity. Along with acceptable Banchan, 'twas a mighty feast. 3.5'd  The attention paid to our group of Travellers was friendly if not minimal at this late hour. The Bell of Four Seasons was used more than once to retrieve our missing Maidens. Alas, we must be on our way, as the mighty JK needs to continue her pillage of GTA."}
{"text":"We came here late night, right before closing.  The owner was super friendly and welcomed us to stay and eat past closing.  The service was excellent, and the food was good. I really liked how the side dishes were large in portion. The food also tasted quite fresh and good, even though their Ja Jang Myun could have been a bit more flavourful.  We didn't have the time to try the Shabu Shabu, but we will try and come back next time to try it out :)"}
{"text":"Stopping in for a quick lunch, I was looking for (wait for it) noodle soup.  I could not really tell what culture the cuisine represented, supposedly Japanese, but some Korean and whatever else filtered in.  The surroundings are clean, slightly modern, but traditional--a really difficult read.  I ordered the Seafood Noodle soup for $9.  Advertised as having hand-made noodles, I thought it would be worth a try.  Soon after ordering, I was presented with 4 appetizer bowls with kimchee, radish pickles, seaweed pickles and an onion pancake.  All of the appetizers were quite tasty.  The soup arrived, hot and steamy.  I found a few mussels, nicely cooked-not overcooked.  However, the rest of the promised seafood was pretty sparse.  Total seafood was maybe 2 ounces.  The noodles were good, thicker than wonton noodles, with a nice flavour.  For $9, I can't really get behind it.  The appys were great, but the soup was only average.  In comparison, Aurora Chinese Restaurant has a Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup for $8, loaded with treats.  Jim Chai Kee in RH has the same soup with massive amounts of fresh shrimp in the wontons for $7.  There are just too many better options for the same or less, that I would only come back if I had a good reason."}
{"text":"I wish to like this place but unfortunately it could be better.  Service: service is friendly and helpful  Food: it is the main issue. The king size dumpling came as room temperature that I had to send it back to the kitchen. The second patch was steamy hot and looked more normal.  The bulgogi hot pot was spicy which was not indicated on the menu which was out of my expectation. Usually bulgogi should have a sweet taste which I couldn`t taste it as all, but it was salty instead.   The only dish I kinda enjoyed was the seafood soup with rice. The broth was okay, but the seafood could be fresher.  The only good thing here is the portion is quite big."}
{"text":"Very homey restaurant as soon as you walk in.  We ordered a steamed dumpling, beef noodle and a kalbi dinner. The food came promptly and tastes very home cooked! We believe it has less sodium as other restaurants, which is a plus!!! We will be back to try their shabu shabu and BBQ next time!"}
{"text":"Four Seasons Noodle Soup and Shabu Shabu opens recently is just perfect for the wintery season.   Beef and Vegetables Shabu Shabu ($12.95 pp) is just amazing! If you are a vegetable lover, you will be happy to know there is over 14 different kind of vegetables in the platter! Love the different varieties and all so fresh! For the broth, there is also choice of mild and spicy.  And noodle or porridge at the end to soak up all the flavored broth. Highly recommended especially when it is freezing cold!  Shiki Dumplings ($8.99) is quite good too! Though not the huge big ones, still sizable!   The interior is spacious but make sure you have a big table as you will need the space for all the banchans and the table cooking stove!  I definitely will be back again for those fresh vegetables and even other spicy hot pots and of course Handmade Noodle!"}
