{"text":"Excellent place, great food and great presentation!
First time in this restaurant and I love the breakfast. 
They have excellent service too I fully recommend this place for a nice breakfast time and for great prices."}
{"text":"my husband & i love cracker barrel ... but ... this location is far from freshness as compared to many others. his order for scrambled eggs looked and acted like a precooked boxed from a cafeteria, though the waitress claimed they're made to order. a \"new\" plate of eggs looked the same except that it was of larger portion. his sausage patty tasted like it was under the food heater a little to long then got cold as he couldn't get over the texture and grease. my biscuit was hot on the outside but luke warm & dry on the inside. again, possibly under a food warmer too long. needless to say, we couldn't even finish our meals and asked for the check, seeing that the waitress tried to avoid us after questioning the eggs. 
we will not return to this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a to go order, and was told it'd be 15-20 minutes. 15-20 minutes turned into 35 minutes. When I called, I specifically asked how long the wait was before I bothered to order. Then when I picked it up after waiting 20 minutes already, it should've been ready. I was obviously upset about the wait and the 3 people I dealt with did not apologize or even pretend to care. I will never go back to cracker barrel again. They don't know customer service and don't care about the customer."}
{"text":"Food was great and nice size portions. Service was seriously lacking even though the manager was there and interacting with others, talking to them and overlooking our table of 5 as was our waiter. Company from out of town was disappointed - they have been to many Cracker Barrel restaurants while traveling and have always been pleased."}
{"text":"VERY disappointing.  I have been to many CB back east, and the service was phenomenal.  I was excited to take the family to CB for the experience.  Our party was seated and we waited a solid 20 mins before we left.  During that 20 mins we were not greeted by the wait staff nor did anyone even bring water or take our drink order.  Like I said very disappointing."}
{"text":"Got there for brunch at 1130. Waiter gets drinks wrong. Ordered food and 45 minutes later still no food and four other tables seated 15 to 20 minutes after us have their food and one is even leaving.  Waiter says five minutes, we waited 10 still nothing. We walked out, recieved no apologies from staff. Just a \"can you tell us where you were seated\". Seriuosly, if you cant serve your customers close to the order they arrived in, close the doors and get out of the business."}
{"text":"Some of the hardest working people I've seen. I went on a Sunday morning for breakfast and I was impressed. We surprisingly only had to wait like ten minutes for a table. We sat down and we had a great server. He had personality (rare) and he actually conversed with us even though he was busy. I don't remember his name but he was a good guy. As a former busser, I watched how the bussers and servers worked together. It was like a \"good job\" kind of attitude I had towards them all. Love the fried apples and biscuits! Will return and try to get employed."}
{"text":"I know this is a new location and they are extremely busy. With that being said, our visit was almost comical. We were told 45 minute wait but was seated in 1 1/2 hours. Lack of drink refilling, 2 flies that wouldn't leave us alone, ordering corn bread with a plate of biscuits thrown on our table because \"corn bread is gone\", and my sons sandwich that came with 5 french fries. Which he found hilarious, even in starvation mode..."}
{"text":"This is a nice stop before heading west to California.  We only eat breakfast here but lunch and dinner look delicious as well.  This is the perfect family restaurant.  The food is ALWAYS on point and prices are good.  If you're from out-of-town and you've never been, you definitely have to give it a try (especially for breakfast)."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is a far cry from its sisters  in AZ and UT. Service was slow. Food was cold. Employees running around doing a whole lot of nothing. Had two different servers come up with food that wasn't mine. Sent a sweet potato back because it was cold, took forever to return. Just a bad experience compared to what we've experienced at other locations."}
{"text":"It's Cracker Barrel. I haven't eaten there for years, at least 8 or more.
We ordered take out last week.
Husband said to give excellent feedback based on the manager fixing a problem with our order.
4 stars for  the manager
-1star for the chicken fried steak"}
{"text":"Great food, short wait times and excellent customer service. I go here for Fish Friday's and they never disappoint. I really enjoy coming to this place. I know I'll get the attentive care and great quality food Cracker Barrel is known for."}
{"text":"This place just oozes atmosphere and really makes you feel that country vibe. The pancakes are crispy, buttery, and fluffy. The biscuits are a little doughy but the taste is just like mom would make. Although if you are coming here for breakfast beware of the flock of people wanting the same experience as you!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food. Waiter kept assuring us it would be out in a minute. After the hour wait the manager came over and told us our food had not even been cooked yet and another 20 minutes. We left after an hour wait and had no dinner! One star is generous!"}
{"text":"Very  disappointed in the service this time. We have always had great food and service. We don't go to this location very much, however this last visit, not so good. They were not that busy on this Sunday morning, we were sat quickly and ordered immediately. Not sure if we waited so long because we ordered lunch late in the morning. But we were told our food was coming up next and we kept waiting for almost 45 minutes. When it finally did arrive it was hot. When I checked out and was asked how was my visit and after explaining to the manager that was also cashiering, all he had to offer was \"I'm Sorry\". Hmm not exactly the reply  I wanted to hear. Not like I was playing a scratcher ticket but the same response - Sorry better luck next time. Not very good Customer Service guys !!"}
{"text":"This restaurant  was HORRIBLE. My husband & I went there Dec 31, 2014-we were driving from CA. to visit family in Phoenix The waitress seemed angry that I didn't order a beverage and only had water, she was rude to me and didn't look at me only at my husband. The food was literally slopped on my plate and dripping over the edge of the plate...the chicken and dumplings were TOTALLY flavorless and had only TWO pieces of meat. The waitress never came to check on us until the end of the meal. We needed extra napkins and refills on iced tea and had to track down someone else towards the end of our meal to get the napkins and tea for us.

This place was expensive and horrible. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"Wouldn't give one star. Staff is beyond unorganized. Told 60 min. After 80 min was told another 25min. Don't come here....unless you want to waste a vacation at Cracker Barrel. RUN AWAY"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to this place.  Every time I ate at one the food has been so yummy!  Not here... food was barely warm.  The gravy for the biscuits tasted like flour.  My boyfriends blueberry pancakes were doughy in the middle.  They need to get it together if they want to save their reputation."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times with my family. The food here is  very good and the service is excellent most of the time. The servers are very helpful. You can customize most of the dishes.  There are very few vegetarian choices but the one available  are excellent. We generally eat Pecan pancake (they are my wife's favorite:-) ), custom egg sandwich, hash browns (casserole), buttermilk biscuits and of course their in house coffee and would recommend them anytime. 

The restaurant is full most of the time especially weekends. But we never had to wait for more than 5 mins."}
{"text":"There was a time that I liked Cracker Barrel. I was young and my taste buds weren't developed fully.  Originally the hominess of the décor sparked my interest in the place, but as I grew I realized that it was all a façade, like a child noticing that mall Santa's beard isn't real.  The store is an interesting place to mill around in if you're waiting for a table, but items are overpriced.  The dining area is kind of cool, if you like feeling like you're eating in a barn.  I have had the chicken pot pie once, and from what I can remember it was tasty, but every time I've been there and asked for it since, it's always been sold out.  As far as other dishes, I don't know what to say because I don't know how to feel about entrees that tastes like nothing.  All of the sides are bizarre, shellacked under a layer of margarine or oil they exhibit that fresh-from-the-can taste.  Everything seems artificial -Should I be eating this? Is this play food?- are questions that might cross your mind.  Yes, the breakfast is fine, but really, how hard is it to screw up eggs and pancakes?"}
{"text":"I wish I could have given this place more stars, but the wait time was ridiculous. We were seated right away, ordered within 10 minutes of sitting down.....then  waited for 5 minutes shy of an hour for our food. There were only 5 other tables occupied so it wasn't as if they were really busy. 3 different waiters came out and assured us our food was coming right out, starting at about the 30 minute mark. Our waiter was really sweet but I think he went on break and forgot about us. When we finally got our food it had a film over it, the biscuits were rock hard and the plates were scalding hot like the food had been under warmers for a while. 
Needless to say, we were dissappointed at our first experience at the local cracker barrel. The one in Kingman is a safer bet any day."}
{"text":"I was bringing my family to Cracker Barrow today a group of 6 but after hearing they fired a 73 year old Vet for handing out a Corn muffin I changed my mind...... I hope others feel the same way......"}
{"text":"Take a journey back to a time when it was still legal to own other people, dysentery was a verbal, and Johnny was packing heat whenever he went for an afternoon stroll through the forest. 

Besides all that, get ready to take a nose dive into some quality old fashioned cookin'. When you are first shown your table water will be waiting. You can take a load off your feet after a long day on the trail and kick that thirst. Then the waitstaff comes at you with a smile only made by the Lord above. You put your order in, look at that picture of a dead kid on the wall, and poof your food is right there before you. 

You take your first bite and it's just like the dug up your momma, pulled some black magic, and put her back in the kitchen for one last meal before she goes back to line dancin' with jesus. 

It's heavenly to say the least. Then out comes your basket of biscuits or corn bread. You know a cowboy opened this place because you can practically taste the cast iron skillet they were made on. 

You could swing a cat at the menu and hit something delicious!"}
{"text":"First the bad news long wait time and the good news is food was delicious Kathy our server was great very attentive she  got our food to us really fast, next time your in Vegas stop on by this is our new must to go place from now on and as you wait you can do some shopping"}
{"text":"I'm not from the South so when we would visit family we'd eat at least once at the Cracker Barrel and it was always a treat.  When we moved to the South family that would visit us loved to eat there as well.  It still remains a treat and is one of my favorite breakfast places but wish they had better coffee.  Their six grain pancakes are the best I've had anywhere and I wish were a regular on their menu, but they have plenty on and even things like grandma's sample breakfast that are not on the menu.  Their Sunday chicken is wonderful and I don't think I will tire of going there."}
{"text":"We went to Cracker Barrel on Monday for lunch ,there was no wait for a table and the service was fast ,the problem start when they bring us the food ,the girl that took our order  Zaila got  it wrong ,I want to try the chicken fried chicken and she bring me the country fried steak also it comes with all the fixing well she forgot the fixings ,I don't have to ask them for anything is there job to bring everything that we order to the table ,they should train bettter there servers .The food was good my family like it but we don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and since I always seem like I'm leaving reviews complaining about the way I have been treated I wanted to do the opposite today.  I would give the food 3-3 1/2 out of 5, but the service was definitely 5 stars!  My server was super friendly and went above and beyond.  And the clerks in the general store were great too!"}
{"text":"This a safe bet when looking for a quiet, comfortable place to eat. Home style, comfort food in a hurry. This location doesnt get as busy as the Litchfield location and it is conveniently located near a Lowes and Wal-Mart."}
{"text":"It took us standing at the Togo counter 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and they won't let you substitute anything at this location - at the other locations Ive been able to substitute to accommodate allergies."}
{"text":"Was there last week they had Exilent food, great servace, a place I will choose to go to more"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel- it brings me back to my Southern roots.
The food is delish: breakfast or lunch, and the country store is cute!
So come sit on a rocking chair or play checkers as you wait. 
Apple streusel french toast will rock your socks- turkey dinner is also great!"}
{"text":"We came here on a snow day and they took us in even though they were closed!

Their cinnamon french toast is phenomenal and a must try for all first timers. Everything else is your standard american breakfast house."}
{"text":"Normally I like breakfast at Cracker Barrel but this one In particular is not up to par! Gave this place two shots and will not be coming back. Terrible service and food. Drive to the arrowhead location for better food for some reason."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this palce... ever. The positives were the staff in the shop were so welcoming and sweet. I loved that feeling walking in first thing in the morning! The store front was clean and well kept. I also thought the restaurant was clean and well-kept as well.

The customer service in the restaurant is what needed the most help and it is why they were only given 3 stars. Breakfast servers should be cheery and happy... that is what I look for in my breakfast places as a Las Vegas local. Take a note from the customer service from the staff in the shop. Maybe smile more... maybe come by our table and fill drinks more or let us know our order coming? Especially knowing it was looking like we were there over 30 min just waiting. 

During the 1 hour time of waiting for our order, I observed different people being served before our party of 4.... although they were seated after us. It didn't seem to matter how many were in their party. Looks like perhaps it just depends on the server and or what they ordered. Amazing cheery customer service could have eliminated any kind of negative perspective first thing in a person's morning."}
{"text":"We were in Arizona so we thought let's try something new that we don't have back home so of course we had to try Cracker Barrel... We were kind of skeptical because usually when a place has a lot of hype you end up being disappointed but it was totally what we thought it was going to be.  The service was good... The food was delish! Price was very reasonable & the portions were large. Also loved the little store full of nicknacks... The girls in the store were beyond friendly & helpful.  
We will definitely be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"This is a highly consistent establishment!

Food ALWAYS fresh and piping HOT - a must.

Long-term servers with kind personalities and efficient service.

Sundays Special = Hand-dipped Chicken Fried Chicken w/ biscuits, fixings is still the BEST on the menu."}
{"text":"We eat at Cracker Barrel about once a month or so.

So far, the Dobson restaurant beats the Chandler one by a mile. We like to eat out late (open until 10pm Sun.-Thurs., 11pm Fri./Sat.). However, after 8pm or so, the Cracker Barrel on Chandler likes to run out of staples (like chicken and dumplings), but not tell you until they bring half of your meal out. \"Oh, did we mention that we're out of the one thing you wanted?\" 

Personally I love the fried catfish with crunchy cornmeal coating, green beans, mac & cheese, and fried okra. If you're in the mood for breakfast, the pancakes are good as well, and the bacon is thick cut and well done. I recently discovered that the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon meal is really cheap compared to a full meal. While I'm not a fan of the biscuits, lots of sausage gravy makes them edible enough. The cornbread is almost as bad as the biscuits. Apparently some people like both, but I can't see it. Cracker Barrel coffee is not that great either, but I drink it anyway. : )

My husband likes the chicken and dumplings above all else, although he'll eat the fried chicken from time to time (DANGER: it's heavy!). 

All in all, if you like Southern cooking, you should give Cracker Barrel a try."}
{"text":"It was busy, but we were greeted
 and seated promptly. Our server was prompt and friendly. My wife ordered the CB sampler with dumplings, meat loaf, and ham. I ordered the country fryed stake. All the food was good except the meat loaf that was bland."}
{"text":"Got our thanksgiving dinner to go, ordered a whole pecan pie with it. When I picked it up I asked if everything was in the bag including my pecan pie and was told it was.  Got home to find an apple pie NOT pecan pie was in the bag. We called back and was told we could come back and exchange it but they were out of pecan pies!  We made arrangements to pick one up Saturday morning.  No apology was ever given, even when I stopped in Saturday to pick up the pecan pie.  As for the dinners they were just okay, each year the food quality goes downhill.  For 39 dollars you wouldn't expect fat and gristle ham and turkey.  We drive to this location because the one near us doesn't have sweet potato casserole.  The sides were great as always but come on, no apology from anyone.  You don't stay busy long with type of service!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for a Cracker Barrel. They all seem the same to me, and this one is no different. The service was pretty good, but the food was only sub-par. There were a lot of little things to look at, such as old games and objects, on the walls. There really isn't much to say about the place, just your average old-country style retaurant."}
{"text":"The Cracker Barrel is such a a great family restaurant, which offers great, \"comfort\" food! I love their low carb grilled Lemon Pepper Rainbow Trout fish, fried okra, green beans, collard greens, cabbage, hush puppies, biscuits, corn muffins, lemonade, and sweet tea. 

More popular hearty menu items include: catfish, haddock, country fried steak and gravy, meatloaf, mac and cheese, homemade mash potatoes and gravy, roast beef, corned beef, sirloin and ribeye steaks, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, sandwich platters, and a variety of fresh salads. 

Additionally, I am a fan of The Cracker Barrel's Pancakes and their French Toast, served with individual bottles of hot, pure Maple Syrup! Also, variety of other tasty traditional breakfast items are served, as well as a nice Kid's Menu."}
{"text":"The food was very average and had nothing special about it. It was plain and lacked any type of flavor. The wait time was almost 30 minutes but then we were seated and had to wait another 30 minutes for our food. Slow service for bad food. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Use to be good, but has gone down hill over the years. All the great waitresses have left. Cracker Barrel only cares about the money they make. Not their guests and especially not their employees. That is why they have such a high turnover. Will take my business elsewhere. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. I am."}
{"text":"This is one of many commercial Cracker Barrel restaurants, so I would equate them to a corporate business. I've noticed that the portions and quality of the food has changed. I sent my ham back because it was a flimsy piece ( see pic) with gristle. It looked like a piece of sandwich ham as opposed to breakfast, steak ham. 
The Waitress was attentive and Manager was amenable, but really, truly, the corporate way is what it is. For tourists, have at it. For locals, I recommend breakfast at The Vic ( food quality is much better), Cafe 25:35, Big Bear diner ( Avondale) or TJ's ( Avondale). Two stars for the Staff."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience ever! My father has severe PTSD and has a service dog; because of this we usually take every precaution to get him in and out of any place we go to. We wanted to take him to Cracker Barrel for lunch since my brother is in town. We signed up for the waiting list online and got a confirmation text a minute later. This text said that my estimated wait time was 50 minutes and to check in with the host to BE SEATED once we got there. We're locals so we waited the 50 minutes and then headed over there. Once we got there the hostess said that it would be another hour. She also mentioned that if you check in on line it doesn't mean anything until you check in at the restaurant. If this is the case, what is the point of this? The food is good here, but definitely not good enough to wait for 2 hours! This is the worst reservation experience ever! Not impressed, I don't think I will ever be going here again."}
{"text":"Very good food, very nice waitress. I would eat here again.  I had never been to a cracker barrel before and I was pleasantly surprised"}
{"text":"Standard Cracker Barrel. Food, environment, cost, all the same. This one was packed at 2pm on a Tuesday which I'm certain most in any other city are not. Just didn't feel like Cracker Barrel though. Maybe it was just because I'm used to the Vegas lifestyle and was looking for more of the laid back attitude I get when visiting CB's in other places, but I wasn't satisfied. The experience is why it only got four stars, not the food. I'll give it another go though, hopefully it will be better."}
{"text":"I was hoping to get something close to homemade and this place yelled out my  name.  Actually my friend and I were going to go somewhere else but then I passed cracker barrel, made a phone call, and poof we changed our minds.  I just thoroughly enjoyed the sweet tea.  There is nothing like good old sweet tea on a summer afternoon-well I guess it was a cold winter's night in Arizona so whatever.  I ordered the beef noodle soup which was so good.  I am actually not feeling to well today and have thought about going to get me some soup:)  HHHHMMMMM!!!!!!  I then ordered the pork chop, it was a little dry but not bad enough not to eat it and had the baked apples and corn.  It was such a simple meal but very good.  Our waiter was Sam who was spot-on and so courteous and friendly and efficient-great!  I would certainly request him on my next visit!!!"}
{"text":"When we got there the waiter \"Jessie\" saw us  and approached our table even though he was not the waiter. He did a fantastic job and took over after I said I was already ready to order. The meal was fantastic and the food service was very prompt. He's an exceptional waiter and I commend him. Thanks Jesse."}
{"text":"After hearing about Cracker Barrel for so long and not having access to one in CA, my friend and I were extremely happy to have stumbled upon one during our weekend in AZ. We're big fans of the carby Southern Comfort foods so I could've been happy just eating cornbread for days. I ended up ordering the chicken dumplings, mac n cheese, and hash brown casserole. I remember looking down at my plate and thinking that it didn't look too appetizing and I had made a terrible mistake. After eating it, I decided that I hadn't, but nothing was life changing, except the hash brown casserole (this was bomb.com, order it and don't think twice). I was most disappointed in the cornbread because it should be their staple and I feel like I've had better, back at my college dining halls. I had an experienced Cracker Barrel friend tell me that they are known for their breakfast foods more, so if I ever come upon one again, I guess I'll stick with breakfast.
So bottom line, this is an average place and you should order the has brown casserole. Definitely good for long road trips because it gives you a nice break, fills you up, and is fairly priced. The little store attached to the restaurant is nice to browse through, and the rocking chairs and checkers boards out front are fun to play with."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!  Finally here!  Welcome to Vegas!!!!!!!!  The service was great! the food was delicious !  the parking was great! it's a little piece of heaven in the desert!"}
{"text":"Went to this Cracker Barrel on Easter Sunday.  Not really busy but the service was HORRIBLE.  Our group was 8.  We were seated promptly and our waiter came and took our drink order.  His face was expressionless, no personality, no people skills,  just a robot.  I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with gravy on the side.  When he brought my plate, it had Chicken Fried Steak smothered in gravy with fries and corn!!!  I sent it back and waited a good while until it came back the right way.  He was serving down at the other end of our table and I was waving my arms wildly trying to get his attention as the silverware I unwrapped had dried food on it!   He did not acknowledge me.  He never came back to check on us,  never refilled our drinks.   Terrible, terrible service, I will never go back there."}
{"text":"The food was hot service was wonderful but there was a hair in the food........The manager took care of us once he realized what happen"}
{"text":"Really excited about finally going to a Cracker Barrel.  After about 20 minute wait we were seated.  Coffee was great.  After almost 40 minutes we got served part of our breakfast.  My wife got her french toast (which were just pieces of toast) and uncooked bacon and no poached eggs.  I got my grits and biscuits & gravy and uncooked bacon and no poached eggs.  The manager kept saying it's coming.  Our server, who was great, kept apologizing.  They brought back our bacon, which still wasn't cooked, and no eggs.  They finally brought out our eggs that were hard boiled - not poached.  By then all the other stuff was cold.  We said we couldn't eat this junk.  The server (Kathy) again apologized and said there would be no charge and please try us again.  The manager never re-appeared.  I gave the server a tip and we left to have breakfast somewhere else."}
{"text":"Could be larger but given the surrounding not much can be done. Arrived around 8 and got lucky on the parking as many cars were circling the building. 

Had the sampler breakfast all items were hot and served promptly. My waitress was very friendly and kept the glasses filled. Overall a very nice experience for some home cooked breakfast. 

Will go again . . ."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a .5 star review but 1 Star will do for now but right now I want to explain my experience with this awful place the place constantly was too warm and smelled like smoke this just is low maintenance and needs to be fixed -sincerely Karen"}
{"text":"i was trying to call in an order, after getting hung up on once, i called back asked if they had a particular soup and the person at the front desk said, i dont know, they dont tell us, then went on talking to another worker about ordering something too big, and after a few seconds of me saying hello, the phone was hung up again!!!! so i thought maybe third times the charm, call, ask for to go line and get transfered, but get bumped back to front counter due to someone already currently ordering, was told i would have to wait on hold till they were done, said okay. waited about 7 minutes then the phone call was picked up and  hung up again without so much as a hello or anything. seriously never have recieved this bad of service or lack there of at a cracker barrel!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places. It's simple and delicious!! They have the best turkey sausage that I've ever tasted. It's so good that I question wether it's really a healthy alternative.  

I also love their pancakes. They are fluffy, buttery and they have little crispy edges that provide a great contrast to the soft, warm pancake. They taste like something you'd get when visiting grandma's house. They seem so simple, yet you know you couldn't recreate it at home. 

I also love their biscuits, but I only eat one bread item per sitting and I usually opt for  the pancakes. 

Finally, I actually enjoy browsing the nic knacks in the front of the store while I wait for my table. Am I the only one who has to fight the urge to purchase those huge candy bars? I mean they are gigantic!! One day I'm gonna break down and buy the 2lb Reese peanut butter cups and a cream soda!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times, but this was it. We got in right away, and we put in our order. Then I noticed that people who came in after me, were getting their food, finally after about 30 minutes or more, I went and got the manager, because, the waitress was useless, she did not even come fill our drinks, while we were waiting. I told the manager what was happening. And he started yelling at me, and pulled an attitude. He said all the right things, be they were said in a condescending manner, and stomped off to see what was wrong. He kept saying,\" I am sorry, we are only human, your ticket got lost do you want me to pay for your food?\" Again, in a very nasty way. All the customers sitting around us, heard this exchange, and all agreed with me, that I was right, and they would have done the same thing. They all said, yea, we saw you here, as they were seating us, so we know what you are saying is true. I know stuff happens, but to be treated like it was my fault, is wrong. The waitress should have been on top of it, but she wasn't. So these two, should not be in the customer service business, I have worked in the customer service business for over 40 years, you do not treat the customer like this, when all I did was order food. Which, by the way, is just mediocre coffee shop food, it is nothing special. This dinner plate they advertise,  is actually a child size, so if you are not very hungry, that is the one. But I do not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Just an awesome place to eat and shop at!!!  I love the store, has many one if a kind finds that spark people's imaginations.  The food is excellent like having good home thanksgiving whenever."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at this Cracker Barrell! Not only was the food great, but the service was impeccable. Our food arrived within 10 minutes of ordering, and no troubles occurred whatsoever. We were also pleasantly surprised with the healthy options that were offered, and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We will be back the next time we are traveling through here!"}
{"text":"I like it. Never had a bad experience here. The food is not mind blowing but the service makes up for that."}
{"text":"The scoop - Good home down food @ pretty good price & 2nds Tiffany's wish that CA/bay area had one..would put IHOP & Denny's out of biz 

Order - Ruben sandwich ~$7/8 
* This is the first time I've had CB for dinner; all other times I've had 
bkfst in FL and it has always been good. 
* Lots of meat; flavorful; enjoyed swiss cheese & sauerkraut 
* Small cole slaw included -good not too sour or watery 

Service - great! waitress brought x-tra water before we even had to ask; appreciate that when bf asked to sub fries for potato she let us know there was an upcharge. Been places where they just say \"okay\" and you never know until you see the bill..which is a pet peeve of mine. So appreciated the FYI. 

Other Comments: bf had their Fri Fish Fry Cod special ~$9/10 comes w/ about 4-5 small pieces & side of cole slaw & fries but he sub for bake potato. I had a piece and thought it was good; not too oily and crunchy batter. Reminded me of McD's fish-filet but w/o cheese. He thought it was ok..but i liked it lots."}
{"text":"Great french toast especially the cinnamon french toast!!!"}
{"text":"Cracker cracker cracker!!!  One of my favorite restaurants.  I love any meal here but most especially the breakfast.  My children split the Grandmas Pancake Breakfast.  Really a good option b/c when you look at the kids menu, by the time you add it all up, you get so much less and at around the same price.  I love anything that contains country ham.  Also they do make omlettes, they just aren't on the menu.  You have to ask.

This location has the best hashbrown casserole.  I've been to just about every Cracker in the area and this is the good stuff.  I've never had an issue with the service here and we go to this one weekly.  

The store has great sales right after holidays.  I got the cutest little ladybug costume for my little girl for next year for like 10 dollars - more than 50% off!  Interesting tidbit, I hear that the company makes most of its money on the store and not the food.  Huh.  Who would've thought?

Get a mug sundae.  AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Recently was invited to this restaurant & found out that they have children's plates for adults or any age.

It was SUPER CHEAP & it included a drink with refills like tea or soda etc.

What a deal!

Under 5. bucks including the drink.

I will definitely  be going back  to any Cracker Barrel who has this deal because it is cheaper than fast food etc. or just about anywhere."}
{"text":"We had never eaten at the Cracker Barrel. We were so excited to go there for breakfast on our weekly date morning. We ordered our food and we were both so disappointed in the quality and taste of the food. The service was great. Our server Jazz was fabulous."}
{"text":"Jen and the manager Chris were so accommodating and kind because my catfish had come out in pieces Chris waived the cost of the catfish and only charged me $4 for the vegetables he said it didn't look like he wanted it he was very conscientious but he did not want me to wait the extra 10 or 15 minutes for the new Catfish"}
{"text":"First time at this location. The wait was about 20 minutes to be seated for breakfast; their method of putting names on the waiting list is terrible as they have someone stationed right at the entrance blocking the only exit and causing a huge backup and people trying to exit have to push through those in line to waiting to have their name to the waiting list. Service was slow and poor, no attention to detail, ignored multiple requests for coffee and water refills. Food was mediocre, eggs cold, pancakes raw in the middle and inedible. Asked for help to resolve and was ignored. Placement of payment cashiers are at the back of the gift shop also a bottleneck and hazard. I realize this is a new location but they have a lot of work to do if they want repeat business. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"Poor service, one dinner order wasn't placed with the kitchen, and raw pancakes. I'm a better cook than the guys in back. Likely won't return."}
{"text":"On several occasions it takes more than 10 minutes to have a server take a drink order and even longer for food.  I approached a manager but all they say is that's too bad."}
{"text":"My husband never used to have Saturdays off, but now that he does, we have started a tradition of going to Cracker Barrel every Saturday morning for breakfast.  The staff is always upbeat and the atmosphere in the store is warm and friendly.  I usually order the \"Old Timer's\" breakfast, which is my favorite.  I especially love the biscuits with strawberry jam on them. Prices are very reasonable and I never leave there hungry."}
{"text":"Let's see: Dennys with Shlock for sale. 

1. They called me to the table.  We go to the table only to stand and watch the busser cleaning the table. This seemed to be a standard practice here.  I guess Cracker Barrel wants its patrons to stand and hover while their hard working bussers bust their ass?  Talk about tacky. 

2. When the server says \"you will have to excuse me, I'm very under the weather...\". I guess when the company is too cheap to move to California because it would have to pay its servers minimum wage, you get severs coming to work spreading their illnesses.  

3. Why the hell eat here when you're in Vegas?  

4. Other than the eggs I'm convinced everything is frozen and reheated in the microwave and deep fryer and covered in gravy and pasteurized cheese food product.  Just like Arby's. 

5.  Don't touch the stupid peg game.  The kid next to me was using pegs to extricate something from his nose. 

6.  Why the hell eat here when you're in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Won't be returning. This place is totally gross. They had the nerve to serve me some really disgusting, old, greasy,hard and burnt scraps of so called Mac and cheese. The manager came over and saw it and didn't even bother to offer me a discount. The food is nasty and the pancakes and biscuits had blue things in them, maybe from rags or something. I'm so disgusted with the quality of the food. The server's always forget to bring some of my food, like the sides or sauces."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I love Cracker Barrel every time I have gone in the past it was very good but tonight Thursday evening at 8:30 PM was my worst experience my food was mediocre to say the least it was very cold only good thing that I can say about this evening was that my waitress was very accommodating and trying to make everything right.she took my plate and when she brought it back it was a whole new plate and it was very hot and it was very tasty!!!so if you're in the Robinson area and are thinking of going to Cracker Barrel just make sure you're there before 8:30 PM.so that your meal can be like grandma used to make it!"}
{"text":"Food is typical Cracker Barrel, everything else is low rent. Those bussing the dishes made noise and breakage into an art form. The food could have been warmer. Actually, it could have been warm, period. 

The highlight (here, anyway) was paying the check and getting out.

For future reference, there are several restaurant choices within walking distance."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. It felt like a down home Denny's if that makes sense. If not oh well...lol. Service was great but the quality of food was lacking for the price. Probably won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Hearty portions, warm friendly service.  House coffee is smooth & rich. Nice place to stop by."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Cracker Barrel experience! What happened to this place? Went for a late lunch yesterday, it was terrible. Portions were extremely small, My first order was sold out , so I went with my favorite chicken and dumplings. Chicken was over cooked rubber, dumplings were dry. and thrown on the plate . Cheese grits were inedible grease. I know it's Cracker Barrel and not a 5 star restaurant , but at least have some pride in what you are serving. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First time I've been to a cracker barrel (that I can remember) and I actually enjoyed the place. Not a particular place that I would be likely to eat at on a regular basis, but it was a good visit. The food was cheaply priced, but still tasty. 

On a side note, it was the first time I had grits. Cannot say I'm a fan, but I definitely would eat them again (they lack any flavor). 

All-in-all: The staff were friendly, the food was good, and the cost was great! This place gets my thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night and had the cod dinner. Excellent service and great food. It was a great experience. I will definitely return here !  Very nice gift shop too."}
{"text":"Tasty, cheap, and close to the airport.  The food is decent and always comes out piping hot. Cheerful staff."}
{"text":"If you've been here before than you know what you see is what you get.  Big portions, average quality, but a family atmosphere.  The country store is cute and the chicken fried steak is the same ever time and at every location I've been to.  Nice to know what you're getting and that it is a great value.  I hit a Cracker Barrel somewhere in the U.S. once a year or so.  Sure it's not a gourmet breakfast, but it sure beats Denny's and IHOP in my opinion."}
{"text":"Horrid service! We waited 70 minutes for a table on a quoted \"45 minute wait\". Once seated, we were totally and completely ignored for 25 minutes while people around us were served. I waved at and made direct eye contact with Doug, the manager (black suit) who ignored me. Finally, I had to interrupt a waiter who was taking another order to finally gain service. Total of 110 minutes of waiting before served.  The food did arrive quickly after order and was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite restaurants! They always have the best comfort food. My five year old daughter loves their pancakes and my husband usually gets the special of the day which is always different and so tasty. I love mama's pancakes with peaches. 
We always have great service when we come here and I can never leave without walking through the store."}
{"text":"Been to Cracker Barrels on several occaisons--maybe 3 or 4.  Never better than mediocre.  I think country cooking means Bland food.  Presentation not the most attractive or pleasing.  Had breakfast--my partner that the Sampler plate.  I had the Biscuit, Fried Apple and Hashbrown Casserole.  Everything just OK--not particularly good or special.   Wait staff very pleasant and efficient.  Just disappointed in the food.  Apples comparable to canned apple pie  filling, gravey-meh, scrambled eggs -eggs were premixed then cooked into little square-omelet style.  Hash brown casserole (goes by name of cheesy potatoes in some recipes) -had much better elsewhere.  Think I've tried Cracker Barrel enough times now that I don't need to go again."}
{"text":"It's a Cracker Barrel: you've either not eaten at one, or you're bored with it."}
{"text":"I was employed by this establishment for a considerable amount of time(I got a job within my specialized field and elected to leave for that reason), and I can vouch that considering the guest volume, this is a great location. You would be amazed at what a long wait time does to people's temperament, and yet, the management and staff handled every complaint with poise. I have been and have seen management \"told off\", yelled at, and slandered for things entirely out of theirs or the staff's control. (ex. The online wait system that is run and managed outside of our jurisdiction) The people who work here are really phenomenal and made the job worth going to. Next time you attempt to trash this establishment, remember that you are dealing with people. Actual people, who despite many setbacks(our restaurant and kitchen being one of the smallest in the company) still open and close that place every day without anything catching fire. I will patronize this store as long as I live in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So today I finally got to try this place! I'm a mom of a 9 month old and don't get out much anymore. Lol. I took my dad and son to brunch and the waitress was very quick to get our order. Finally we ordered and she forgot a few things but brought them. No big deal. Then my dad got coffee and every time he saw the girl come around she went to every table but ours. He finally asked for a refill when the server finally came back. The food was good but the gravy wasn't hot. We loved the hash browns! Service was fine. BUT when we went to check out there were three ppl at the registers and while I juggle my son, diaper bag, and high chair cover no one acknowledges us to check us out. THREE ppl! I mean the guy is literally just looking at me struggle and still doesn't offer to check us out. Finally he goes \"I'll take care of you here.\" Well thank you for finally stepping up to do your job. The two ladies were sweet and could tell I was irritated at his rudeness. There was no one else there but us so it was strange that no one wanted to help us. Anyways, I asked my dad to add a 20% tip and the guy literally tells my dad an amount to write which wasn't even 20% it was 30%!!! In what world is it ok for an employee to tell a guest an amount to tip especially when it's not even close to what I asked! They were lucky I was still giving the 20% but it wasn't the servers fault. And I never asked for his input. So my review is that they solicit tips here and don't have any country hospitality."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place. It was so good. i had the catfish platter with green beans, mashed potatoes,and corn. Ooooo..with biscuits that melt in your mouth... oooo and apple butter. YES! I will definitely find one to go to in cali.
Our waitress was soooooo sweet. LOVE HER!"}
{"text":"Breakfast only.

Let's be real here.  This is shame eating at it's best.  A pile of eggs, grits, potato casserole, biscuits, gravy and multiple meats on the same plate for like...$8?  Yep, they do that.  You might make the mistake of thinking, \"I better do something on the healthy side...\"  What you'll do is get something like oatmeal that will make you're teeth hurt with sweetness.  Don't fall for it.  Just shame eat your way through 1,400 calories, a bucket of fat, and waaaaay too much sodium.  You'll love every second of it and only hate yourself for an hour after.  And hey!  You can grab yourself some candy, classic toys, and a chintzy cowboy hat on the way out!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were seated by 9:10PM. I wish I caught the name of the waitress, she was so incredibly rude to our party I was actually a little surprised. Usually Cracker Barrel servers are overly friendly, this one actually prompted me to ask if we were there past closing. (Which wasn't the case, they close at 10pm). Anyway, we are naturally pretty polite...yes ma'am, no ma'am, thank you, no thank you etc. she didn't once say your welcome or speak to us really except rushing us to order and leave. She made it very awkward and very obvious that she wanted to get her area done and empty. We left at 9:50 and even stacked our plates up for her and picked up any scraps/ trash we may have left. Hope it wasn't too much for her. Awful service, the manager for the evening watched us walk out and didn't even say goodnight or inquire of our visit. So if you must go, try a different locution or at least got before 8. Maybe they find that timing more efficient. Food was ok, bread was stale and chicken was overcooked. Won't be dining there anytime soon."}
{"text":"We sat and waited for 15 minutes while two waitresses assisted on two tables near ours. We didn't even get asked for a drink order and watched a couple that came after us enjoying theirs. We were hoping that when we told the hostess she would take accountability and inform a manager but all she said was sorry so we left."}
{"text":"Ate there tonite. The chicken fried chicken was great. Will visit there soon again.  The wife particularly enjoys the chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"I'm from California so not a native fan of Cracker Barrel, but I'm converted now. I come here just for the pancakes and they are spectacular. Good Job Cracker Barrel on a delicious pancake recipe and cooking. Mama's pancake breakfast is the only thing I order and it's really very good. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews, so me writing this means alot! 
I'm in vegas with my family coming from northern california and I personally actually work as a server as well as manage at a restaurant. This place is AMAZING, country delicious food their hashbrowns are amazing. Our server is actually the reason why im writing this her name is Zayla. Reason why she impressed me so much was her service she is amazing, she had friendly attitude as well as quality service with up keeping with our needs. My favorite quality about her most of all is that she is not fake! Her personality is amazing and caring and she didnt need to just fake a smile ( like other servers do) to show it. She is an asset to this place and if i am ever to come back to this business i will ask for her ! 
Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"My Wife's favorite place for a quick meal!!! I for one enjoy your Breakfast Menu!! Close by in Buckeye is a plus also!!"}
{"text":"This place is packed at weekends dinner time. I waited 40 mins for the foods and my medium-well  steak was bleeding with blood. After asked for cook again it's like another 10 min wait time. 
  On the other time I order the same steak and what showed up was probably grilled salmon. 

  On the good side, the server was extremely polite and friendly. And the ambiance was nice for a busy weekend. Bathroom was neat. Overall this is a great dinning place if lucky."}
{"text":"Not sure as to why this location has three stars. Manager was welcoming to us by opening the door. We spoke with him about our location opening up in California. Great guy! Staff very friendly and food has always been fabulous at every location. 

Very neat, clean and organized. My boys 4 and 9 we very thankful and loved this place. They offer breakfast, which was a treat for our older boy. 

Bathroom super clean. Very busy. Although, they sat us right away. We enjoyed our dinner and the environment very much."}
{"text":"I went to this Cracker Barrel on a Thursday evening. The staff was very friendly. We were seated quickly.   The breakfast meal with Pancakes, bacon, and eggs arrived about 5 mins after being ordered.  

The food was OK. A Waffle House plate of similar build is more appealing than what I was served. The friendly attitude of the staff here balanced the outing a bit. I was asked by at least 4 different individuals if everything was to my satisfaction.  I also enjoyed the nostalgia of the old candies and snacks from the 80's and 90's. 

Overall is was a very middle of the road experience. Good service. OK food. Pretty good price point."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Been to Cracker Barrel hundreds of times in different states. Unfortunately the waitress we had is the reason this is a 2 star review. She had the vibe that seemed very fake. As soon as we sat down she immediately asked us if we were ready to order. Didn't ask us if we wanted drinks or anything before. We saw the guy that was pouring iced tea more then our own waitress! She was terrible. We wish our tip had gone to the guy pouring iced tea."}
{"text":"Only caught Sandshrews and Geodudes. No poke stops or gyms around -__- Best pancakes I've ever had though!!"}
{"text":"My first time at a Cracker Barrel, was thoroughly satisfied. Waited 10 minutes for a table but there is a gift shop to keep yourself busy. Service was good, we got food and drinks in a reasonable amount of time. Servers were friendly and efficient. Biscuits were heavenly. Best bathroom in Vegas for hangover poops."}
{"text":"We came here for a late breakfast ... eggs overcooked gravy cold wrong side with one dish told 3 different people and never got a response from any manager and they didn't do anything to fix it ..... I will not come here again ... getting ready to call corporate.. Jason"}
{"text":"I used to go here often, but the last time I went I had to send back my country fried chicken because I asked for gravy on the side. Another chicken filet was brought to me with no gravy...and for some weird feeling I had by the vibe I got for sending back my food, I thought I'd just check the underneath. What do you know. A spit loogie. As much as I wanted to believe it wasn't and write it off as the manger did as \"grease and oil\"...I knew it wasn't. It wasn't handled appropriately from management and I can't get myself to ever come back since then...that's all I can think about and how that was feasible to happen without much empathy. Very upsetting."}
{"text":"Love this crackle barrel not just because it's the closets to me but because they have fun nick nacks and items in their gift shop and excellent service through out the entire restaurant. And the food is amazing! My favorite is grandpas chicken fried chicken and a side of fried okra. Yum!"}
{"text":"The wait was long, the food was rather cold and the service was inattentive. 

 Stopped here on a Sunday at 12:30 pm on our way through Madison and waited 40 minutes for a table.  Once seated the young waitress got our drinks and then took our order and then neither she nor our food was seen for about 25 minutes.

My wife ordered breakfast including biscuits and gravy and when the food arrived the food was rather cold and she was told biscuits would be 8 minutes.  15 minutes later they arrived and by then the gravy - which was not replaced - was cold.  I wanted lunch so ordered a Reuben and it was surprisingly good though also a little cold. There was ample corned beef and nicely toasted bread. 

A rather poor dining experience and will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"We went on valentine day for breakfast. It was a party of 16, we were told that there was a wait of 20 minutes. ....30 minutes passed so we asked if our table or tables were ready.... the host told us that we had to to wait an additional 30 minutes... I asked to speak to a manager. When speaking to the manger there was no apologies all he said that he can not \"magically\" make room for us..... My response was WOW!  I know this is not Disneyland! Unfortunately, we didn't get to experience great service, all we got is BAD service, sarcasm and unprofessional ways to treat a paying customer. 

I didn't even want to leave a STAR but I have NO CHOICE but to rate this restaurant for their horrible service in order for me to share my experience. I don't and won't recommend ANYONE with a large family to come to this place since they can't do MIRACLES (according to the Manager) to accommodate a paying customer, party of 16"}
{"text":"This place has the best pancakes I have ever tasted!! You have to try them if you come here. Fast and very friendly service as well"}
{"text":"The service here was pretty good! The food was bland and the tea was terrible, however. My first time eating at a Cracker Barrel and I'm in no hurry to ever go back to one."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place one star was because the food was decent, but the service was horrible. I know our server Andrea M. was drunk because my husband and I could smell the booze on her like it was a perfume. She was slurring her words a bit and was just rude. As for your management to allow that is very unprofessional and a liability for your company. I spoke to the lady in your general store and she told me that this young lady comes in all the time either still drunk or hung over. Because of this I will never go into another one of your restaurants and as a restaurant owner in Minnesota this girl would have been fired the second she walked in smelling of booze."}
{"text":"My first time here and my last time.. The food was horrible the chicken was all oily like that with the topping..if I can give it -5 stars I would.. The service was horrible as well. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"When living in the south Cracker barrel was the place to go. My daughter and I decided to go to the cracker barrel out here in Vegas and it was disgusting ! Eggs were watery , gravy was clumpy, sausage looked gross, and the biscuits were not southern they looked like they were frozen and heated. We ended up walking out cause I thought I was gonna vomit. All I can say is keep cracker barrel in the south where it's suppose to be! Bringing it to Vegas is just gonna ruin it's reputation of being a real southern restaurant. It really isn't worth one star."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since it opened... We have eaten at Cracker Barrel all over the country but tonight's meal was horrible. We ordered our usual which is meatloaf and chicken and dumplings with three sides each. Both our meals were missing one side each and everything was cold .... which made no sense because the lady brought it out 30 seconds after they ran my debit card... There  was no silverware in the bag either..... The manager didn't return our phone call so we could let them know how they forgot half our order..... Thanks  Cracker Barrel for losing a customer that's the last 37 bucks you get from us ... Home cooked crap"}
{"text":"Their breakfast is amazing. The portion size to price ratio is very reasonable, and the food itself tastes great. Employees are all very polite, and the service is great. Overall, I have no complaints; I come here all the time!"}
{"text":"I have not been let down here... Service was awesome and food was good. Had Grandma's Breakfast, and it was tastey. Our server was great... Friendly, attentive, and on the ball...even joined with us. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I am the \"duke\" of this place so obviously I go way too often.  One of the main reasons I go here is because it is the only the sit down restaurant in the area.  At one point, I was an also employee of Cracker Barrel and I can honestly say they treat their employees as well as their customers!"}
{"text":"This review is probably more a review of the location than Cracker Barrel in general. I'm from the South and appreciate good Southern food. CB is consistently good. It's not top-shelf food, but it's inexpensive so I feel like it meets my expectations.

I've had consistently good service here and the employees are usually really friendly. I go every few months and usually end up here on Saturday or Sunday morning, so I've been very happy with the service and food, especially considering how busy it is at these times."}
{"text":"WOW this place was awesome. The food was beyond my expectations. Our server Lisa was amazing. I'm definitely comeing back"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever visited. Apparently they did not schedule properly for a Good Friday crowd. We waited about 10 minutes to even put our name on the waiting list because the hostess couldn't figure out how to take names and call names at the same time. Then we were seated and had to enjoy our brunch next to a filthy table because they did not schedule bus boys for today and it sat empty with plates and food thrown everywhere the entire time we ate!  Really?!  Get with it Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"I was really excited  to try this restaurant but when I got there and there was a huge line I was starting to dread it.
The host told us that the wait looked long but it would only be about 15 to 20 minutes so we decided to wait. Long story short; the wait was 60 minutes and the food didn't arrive for another 35 minutes, after that......total wait 95 minutes.
Then the food arrived; I ordered the fish sandwich. The bread was not toasted and it had been sitting in some water or sauce so that the bread was all mushy....just sort of slopped on the plate with very little care. I sent it back!!!!
The manager offered to go in the back and make it herself but by this time we had already spent too much time at the is place as we had other places to be.
Long story short; I would avoid this place until and unless they get their \"stuff\" together
I've worked in f and b all my life , every job from running the restaurants, owning them to washing the dishes so I have some back ground and experience..........
Start retraining your people from scratch.

{"text":"I went to the Cracker Barrel on east Craig Road for lunch on 1/18/17. I was seated immediately although the restaurant was full. Mt food server was Andreanna and she was wonderful, she went out of her way to do everything possible to make my dining experience a pleasant one. I visited with the manager Ellie who was great and dedicated to customer satisfaction. The food was great!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!  Was waiting in line to be seated for 5 mins.  No hostess/host so I asked one of the front cashiers if we seat ourselves, with rude tone and attitude she stated that someone would be right with us.  The service was good but I ordered a Ribeye medium well, it came out well done, sent it back, the 2nd one was well done too... They didn't even take it off of the bill.. I had to eat a hard piece of steak and I am a particular steak eater so it was not good!  I am going to seriously think twice before going back.."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since it opened and I will fight anyone who wants to drag me to this location again.  I went the first time with my, at the time 3 year old nephew and 5 year old niece, about 2 weeks after it opened and dinner was a disaster.  The kids were fine, food was cold, the booster chair fell apart, and the bill was wrong.  (Another table was added to ours)..  Figuring this for just opened , I went back several months later.  It was still bad!  Table was not washed off, food was on the floor and my order was missing one of my sides that finally showed up at the end of the meal and was cold,  They were NOT busy that day either.  

Most recently, about a year or so ago, a friend of mine graduated with his masters degree and I and some other friends were treated along with the graduate, to dinner.  The graduate was served raw sausage and another friend, who does NOT salt her food, almost emptied the salt shaker trying to make her \"famous chicken and dumplings\" taste like anything resembling food.

This location repeatedly fails to meet the standard upheld by other locations."}
{"text":"Just lunch to go. Once we got home and opened the roast beef plate  to find two very small pieces of meat most of which was fat. Very Disappointed. .. My wife got the chicken dumplings which was a large portion and great taste."}
{"text":"Was so excited to eat at the new Cracker Barrel. What a disappointment!!! Took the entire family of 9 there. Submitted our name for seating and they told us to be back in 1 hour and 45 minutes. We returned early in 1 hour and 15 minutes only to find out that they had given our table away and marked us off their list. They put us back on the waiting list and moved us to the front of the list but provided no apology. Had to wait another 30 minutes to be seated.  Our waitress Cassie was terrible but her partner James was great. Took forever to get our drinks. We also requested water which Cassie never brought out. Our food came out in waves. No sight of Cassie.  Our drink glasses were all empty. My husband and son were just about done with their food when me and a couple of my daughters finally got ours. My youngest daughter didn't get her meal until we were all just about done eating.  The food was terrible, my food was lukewarm at best, and to top things off I found a wadded up piece of Serran plastic wrap in my vegetable medley. Yuk!!  Absolutely gross!!!! James was very apologetic and asked if he could bring me something else. The manager on the other hand just smiled and said thank you. Never an apology or inquiry with us as to what they could do better or how they could make it right.  Poor management! Poor food! And probably some of the WORSE service I've EVER received in Las Vegas or at any Cracker Barrel. Cassie finally showed back up to give us our bill but she was MIA throughout our entire dining experience.  Won't be going back!!"}
{"text":"You know this is a great spot for delicious home cooked meals!  I ordered the sampler that included sugar ham, meat loaf and chicken n dumplings.  My sides included fried okra, mac n cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy.  I also order their seasonal mixed berry cobbler with ice cream.  It was good, but was more ice cream with fresh berries than a cobbler!"}
{"text":"We are visiting from Southern California and just had breakfast here. The food was awesome and the staff was so friendly! We had the blueberry pancakes, French toast, and hashbrown casserole - everything was delicious!!! We highly recommend this place and will definitely be back on our next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"First time here & the food was good..loved the chicken fried steak, greens, mac & cheese got to sample off my husbands plate...I myself ordered the Chicken & Rice w/ sweet potato, loved the chicken & Rice only suggestion there was so much wild rice & not enough gravy next time ill order more gravy....loved the baked sweet potato w/ some brown sugar & butter, seriously amazing, small potato but for me it was just the right amount of delicious, the staff was very friendly,  and can't wait to go back..its a must if you never been. Big kuddos to the manager gal who came up to check up on us several times, super nice & friendly will come back & visit & eat again"}
{"text":"Came here after a very rough night, and not due to drinking. I've been saying for years that as far as breakfast goes at a chain restaurant, Cracker Barrel is where it's at!! 

Their breakfast is old school southern style. Biscuits and gravy, grits, pork chops and hashbrown casserole. A meal fit for a redneck king!! 

The service was cheery and pleasant, which we needed after our depressing night. 
I would come here everyday for breakfast and not even give a shit about my cholesterol levels!!

Kudos Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"This is more like it!  We were here with party of 8 this past weekend and out food was hot, accurate and tasty!"}
{"text":"It was an average restaurant. Mill gravy is to sweet and as other reviewer stated needs more pepper and really could use chunks of sausage. The smoked sausage was very good, would love the gravy with it in it. For breakfast the price is right. Service was great I'd give our girl a 5 star as she was prompt and nice, took good care of her customers. Our food was delivered very very fast I was shocked."}
{"text":"I have noticed that lately the food and service are getting worse and worse. ICE cold mashed potatoes, burnt hashbrown casserole, slow service and not getting refills on time. Seems each time we go it gets worse and that is all locations."}
{"text":"My first experience with Cracker Barrel was in Alabama, and it seemed so terrific.

I loathe it now when friends want to meet us for lunch at Cracker Barrel off of Carowinds...

First, I don't think they clean the tables or chairs. They're always sticky, and based on the people that corral there, I can imagine not many washed hands touch the menus and dirty paper inserts.

For the \"home comfort food\" served, it seems like it's all plopped on a plate from a large vat in the back, but the portions are so small for the price. Really? $5 for 2 hotcakes? Gross syrup containers that looks like several children slobbered all over the handles? My side of coleslaw is about 2 tablespoons."}
{"text":"Happy Thanksgiving!  First it's great that the restaurant is open on Thanksgiving. But when I have to wait 20 minutes AFTER I paid for my to go order (that I called in) just to be acknowledged about my order there is a problem.  Note that I still didn't get my correct order until 30 minutes AFTER I paid for my meal.  

Initially, they forgot about me and the person who was in line before me.  Well the lady came and asked the guy's name and then went to the kitchen to find his order.  Then it's my turn...and I had to wait even longer because they didn't know what I ordered.  I showed the waiter my receipt and she brings out a pie only.  I looked in my bag before I left the store.  Where the heck is my food?  So then I go stand by the kitchen and give them my receipt along with the bag letting them know they forgot my meal.  I just stood there at the kitchen and finally they got my order right.  Seriously?!"}
{"text":"We live on the west side of the valley and last night we  had a meeting scheduled on the east side. Needing a place for dinner along the way, we picked the Cracker Barrel. We've never eaten at this restaurant but have had good meals at others.

We allowed extra time because these restaurants are usually pretty busy. We should have added another hour.

From the time we entered the parking lot till we got a table was less then five minutes. You can't beat that, but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at a table in the center of the building, with my wife facing the front and I the back. To my left was another couple at a table about 3 feet away. On my right were three more tables, along the wall, with a husband and at each.

The waittres got our drink order quickly and while she was there, we ordered our dinners hoping to speed things up. While we were waiting the couple on my left finished up and left. At that point we were there about 20 minutes. About 5 minutes later another couple was seated at that table.

The waitress (the same lady that is serving us)was there quickly and took their drink order. A short time later she was back and got their food order. At about the same time one of the couples to my right finished up and left. Again, about 5 minutes later the table was filled again. A different server was helping them and it was probably 10 minutes later that their food order was taken. At this point we were about 40 minutes into our experience.

Another 10 minutes passes and I see our surver approaching with a tray of food but she goes to the table on my left. What? As she leaves I catch her eye and ask where is our food? She says something about a server not coming in and having to take her tables also and their food came out first. I give her a disbelieving look and she leaves. Another few minutes go by and the newly arrived couple on my right gets their food. Now we've been there close to an hour.

Now a older lady shows up at our table an apologizes for the delay and tells us one of their grills is down and they are running a little behind. I ask her how come these other two tables got their food before us and all she can say is that a grill is down. What?

Soon after that our food arrived.  It was good and there was plenty of it, but we had to gulp it down, get our check, leave, and drive like crazy to get to our meeting.

All together we were there for about an hour and twenty minutes. The're are a couple of things that should be looked into: First they lied to us. I'm sure our order got lost. Way not just admit it. Tell the truth. Second, show you care by comping one of the dinners. Don't just sluff it off as business as usual. 

We will not be returning to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I guess if I had just started going there I would rate it higher. It's not anything like it use to be. We started going to ones in the south and have been going to this one since it first opened. I like my scrambled eggs DONE. They can't manage it no matter what day or the week or time of the day I go. They're runny so I have to order them \"done well\" which to them means brown. :( The best thing they have is the hashbrown casserole but there is no consistency. Sometimes it's over done, sometimes soupy, sometimes the onions are twice the size, etc... Oh and the prices keep going up while the portions get smaller. If you want to do a little shopping, it'll work. If you just want good food, done right.. as sad as I am to say this.. Maybe look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Same great food that I've had at other locations around the country.

Yes, of course there is a long wait to be seated, this is normal and expected for a high demand restaurant that is opening their first location in this part of the country."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has many goodies in their pantry, but a seasoning cupboard is not one them. The food is not exactly pricey or horrible, but very bland. Based on the southern recipes I grew up with from my great grandma, I know older style cooking typically has less seasoning than the cuisine aimed at more modern palettes. However, even fat and salt aren't enough to give their classic chicken and dumplings any interest (they were the worst of my sample platter - imagine chicken pot pie but without colorful veggies, crunchy crust, or taste). 

The ham and meatloaf faired better but still are nothing to go out of the way to get (I have had better ham from a little breakfast burrito place wedged in a small strip mall). The mac and cheese was the biggest disappointment. Blandness aside, it felt like watered-down Stouffer's with a thin sauce that felt neither creamy nor cheesy. I enjoyed the fried okra (similar to a drier and non spicy fried jalapeño), but it could use a dip or seasoning salt. The best thing on the plate was the hash brown casserole which aside from being cheesy had pepper (which they really should introduce to their other offerings). 

Biscuits are good. However, likes everything else, they aren't that impressive (maybe I have been spoiled by Mrs. Knotts). Also they came slightly after the meal... before would have made a nice little appetizer to spread out the eating process  like butter. 

Also, you get to wait in a line in a cramped store to pay. Yay."}
{"text":"This place has awful wait list management.  
Summary:
Called ahead, told wait time was 40 minutes
Got to location, put name on wait list, nobody said anything different
Waited 70 minutes without a table, asked what was up, and told wait time was TWO HOURS
Our out-of-town guests had to hit the road back to LA with two hungry kids

Details:
We had a party of 9, so we called ahead of time to get an idea of the wait time.  We were told ahead of time the wait would be \"about 40 minutes.\"  Ten minutes later we arrived at the restaurant and put our names on the wait list.  Nobody said anything about a longer wait time,

70 minutes later, we asked what was going on, since we were close to 2x the wait time that we were told.  The guy at the front looked at our name on his iPad and he said, \"your wait time is shown as 'about 2 hours.'\"   I get that any restaurant can only seat a certain number of people each day and that large parties are hard to accommodate.   But, if CB told us on the phone it would take 2 hours, we would have found another place to eat.

It is totally unacceptable for a restaurant to quote one wait time and then fail to inform us that this time had actually TRIPLED.  Not going back here."}
{"text":"I have to admit I was hoping for better from the restaurant, given I've been to a number of Cracker Barrel places across a number of states over the years. When it first opened, I was like most in that I was going to wait it out due to the crowds. I was placing an order to go and I didn't initially see what I wanted on the menu. The person taking my order told me that they could do an omelette, it just wasn't on the regular menu. I ordered an egg-white omelette (five egg whites), with bacon & cheese.  She asked if I wanted to add ham and a few other options (green peppers and onions, etc.).Then she asked if I might want something like seasonal fruit.

My order (as it went to the back) was a bacon and cheese omelette (with the requested egg whites), grilled green peppers, 4oz ham, a side of seasonal fruit, and coffee. What I was actually charged for was the omelette, the side of ham, and coffee. 
Omelette with bacon, cheese, and two additional egg whites:  $12.57
Ham, 4oz:  $5.99
Coffee:  $2.39
(I purchased several items from the store as well, but those are not at issue here.)
$18+ for an omelette.....good grief. I start cutting into the omelette....there is *NO* bacon in it. I had already called the restaurant once to try and figure out what happened with the order as there was an order of fruit on one receipt but not on another. Then I asked what exactly I got for the $18 omelette. The manager said he saw the omelette in the back and noted that it was a good looking omelette, but sure was expensive. Ya think? I told the server that I didn't mind paying for the special order, but since there are no prices on the menu for the omelette, etc. it becomes a luck of the draw for what you are paying, it seems.

After I ended the call, that's when I found that for all that money, I didn't even get what I paid for...extremely frustrating. First, there's no way I would ever pay that kind of money for an omelette again and if I could upload the pictures (which I'll try) it would be clear to the consumer why $18 for what I got is appalling. That was my first and last visit to the \"new\" Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"The fried chicken here on Sunday's is the BOMB!!!!! All I need is some hot sauce and ranch, then it's on.  =P"}
{"text":"Great comfort food.  The country style selections are numerous and prepared properly.  The staff is friendly, helpful and courteous.  It get's really busy at lunch time and meal times on the weekends.  The bathrooms are cleaner than most."}
{"text":"This location is clean and efficient.  Our waitress was awesome and had our order in and food out VERY quickly.  The food is all fantastic and of good quality."}
{"text":"GreAt food, nice people, but watch your silverware, might be dirty. Strawberry iced tea is great."}
{"text":"Geez, given all of the happy people out there, I actually feel bad about giving a low grade, but in the interest of an honest review I am gonna be, well, honest. 

I do not like this place- I have been a million times (to a few of them), I have family who just love it- but I just cringe every time I hear I will have to go. 

First off, I totally get why this place is so popular, it's cheap, the food is not totally toxic and it has this comfy, old timey feel... I hear. 

That being said, I just feel like all of the food is totally cheap, not in the yay a deal way, but rather, everything tastes like cheap, low quality ingredients. I went out on a limb today and ordered the veggie skillet- semi healthy I am thinking, man was I wrong! The veggies weren't fresh at all and they were damn, damn greasy. The eggs were eggs, and then it looked like someone threw a bunch of cold grated cheddar on top... eww. 

On to the service- I will say that I have had a (really) few good service experiences here, but they are pretty few and far between. For some reason, I always see people walking around with the coffee, but they do that whole avoid eye contact thing and I sit around without any coffee. The servers always seem like you are the table that is gonna push them over the edge because they are hanging on by a string. 

For some reason, it just never feels like a nice experience, so I will continue subtly sending my message to family by making faces anytime I hear this place on the table for the meeting spot to eat."}
{"text":"Well you think going to cracker barrel it  would be the same no matter what one you go to. Well I'm sorry to say that's not the case. Our server Rose D was not very good. She didn't smile once during our visit. It seemed like she hated her Job. I would say go to  st. George  if you want that good old cracker barrel feel and service. The food was so so normally it is amazing."}
{"text":"Used to like this location a lot, but just went there with my son this past week and my opinion has changed. The host was very friendly and sat us right away. We waited about 10 minutes before our waitress made it to us, she seemed very discombobulated and out of sorts. My son got the chicken and dumplings, which was great according to him. I got the country boy sampler, per my usual order, the waitress asked me, the customer, what all that comes with!! She said she doesn't work breakfast shift, but you can order breakfast anytime of the day there, so one would think all the servers there would know the whole menu. After getting our food, our waitress put our check on the table immediately , assuming we were not going to order anything else. Overall not happy with the whole experience, but will give it another try."}
{"text":"As always the breakfast was super duper good. The hash brown casserole was a ooey gooey lump of goodness. So glad they opened here in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ordered the heat 'n serve meal for Thanksgiving and it definitely exceeded my expectations. I picked it up the day before and the meal was complete with turkey and all of the fixings in a conveniently prepared manner with heating instructions and everything. The meal was even carried out to my car by one of the staff. The food was awesome and I have plenty of leftovers to make new meals throughout the week. I highly recommend this and plan to do it again next year."}
{"text":"It's a Cracker Barrel.  There's nothing noteworthy about this particular restaurant.  That's not a bad thing.  If you have eaten at a Cracker Barrel before, you know what you're getting here, too.  Decent service, kind of a cattle-car mentality to that.  Solid food, and far too tempting candies and trinkets in the country store.  I like Cracker Barrel, but with so many amazing restaurants out there, it's hard to give one more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"First time here the place was busy but the wait was only 10 minutes! Then we had the best waitress Holly,everything was perfect we will be back for the great service provided by our waitress! Food was great service as better!"}
{"text":"Me and my family were very excited to have C&B in Vegas. Unfortunately we didn't enjoy this location at all
1. We were told wait list is 20-25 min but actually waited more than hour. If we knew this before we would just turn around and come back another day.
3. Because of the ridiculous wait we were seated at 10pm (closing time).
I believe because of us getting table at closing time we didn't have a good service - drinks barely got refilled, food order was mixed up."}
{"text":"We just finished a fantastically delicious meal at Cracker Barrel here on Vegas. I'm originally from Ohio and the food here is like home cooking to me. The green beans, they're what I come here for. They're exactly like my grandmother used to make. This is comfort food at its best. We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated but boy it was really worth the wait. Service was quick and friendly too."}
{"text":"Let me just start off , I am an east coaster and I am very hard on customer service. 

And I have to say I really love this place! 

The staff is amazing, very attentive and sweet! 

I always get eggs in a basket , eggs cooked medium :) with orange juice and a coffee! 

Stop here for a home made tasting breakfast :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited for Cracker Barrel but was let down. I know they just opened but wow... ok here goes : 1/12 hours to sit, had to ask for prices on so many things in the store that I gave up, salad dressing all over my husbands chair, caked on food on my son's silverware, forgot to put in our order ...so another hour waiting for food, medium steak was all pink, forgot my baked potatoe and broccoli , no tea ready ! I expect more from Cracker Barrel 
(who trained these people)."}
{"text":"Wait time was about 15minutes, food took forever, about 30 minutes. The food was not as good as I remembered. just so so"}
{"text":"Always a good choice for breakfast.

If you've been to CB before you know what your getting if you haven't, we'll... it's simple, clean with a friendly and efficient wait staff. Any negative reviews are exceptional cases. CB is consistent and a good value"}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast, great portions and very good price. Uncle Herschel's favorite @ 7.99. Can't Beat it."}
{"text":"First time there.  It was so good!  We all liked our meals!  Service was ok but appetiser came after the meal as well as salads"}
{"text":"Lovely experience and tasty food! The service was wonderful and the manager even came by to check on all his customers. We had a great hostess, coffee server, & waitress. 

Ask to sit in Delana's section...you won't be disappointed! Southern hospitality at its best!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is the happiest place on earth.  My husband and I arrived early Sunday morning to avoid the crowd. Food was, as always, delicious and our waitress was very attentive. Now  it's time to get a Cracker Barrel in San Diego."}
{"text":"Went back and tried the pecan pancakes. Couldn't be more satisfied. Crispy edges, soft centers, and buttery pecans. Plus, the BEST sugar free syrup I've ever had. Didn't taste chemically at all, which unfortunately most you can buy at the store do. I actually bought a bottle to bring home."}
{"text":"Good place for home cooked breakfast plus you can get a little shopping in the little contry store would go again"}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm not used to the type of food they serve here,  but it's never been good.  Last time I ordered french toast.  Got 4 slices of soggy french toast. The egg wasn't even cooked on it! Potatoes and grits were very bland. But I love the golf tee game!"}
{"text":"So, coming from the Midwest, I am VERY familiar with Cracker Barrel. Well, I don't really know what happened to good ole' home style cooking we were so use too. We were in AZ last week for the entire week. We live in CA now so, we had been looking forward to going to CB for a whole month. Well, I can say that we will never go to CB again! That's a HUGE statement for us to say because we raised our kids going to CB since they were small. Of course when we moved to CA we missed it even more. It's just not the same anymore. The food was terrible, portions smaller, service was not the same. It just doesn't feel like home anymore. It makes us very sad that CB changed so much since we were there 3 years ago. We visited the same CB in Mesa 3 years ago. On our way to AZ we stopped by another CB in Buckeye and the service and food was the same as Mesa...sad. Sorry CB you have lost long time customers."}
{"text":"The food is always so yummy and the service is always great. Everyone is so nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, but NOT this location. The staff and food is great, but unfortunately the area is UNSAFE. Last night I placed a takeout order, and in 8 minutes of waiting, a couple pulled up  in a truck, smashed my window in, and took my backpack. I was parked in front of the store in plain view of diners and the gift shop. The convenience store and the hotel across the street is full of shady people. I found out there was a shooting just a few weeks ago at the hotel there, and this morning the street was reported in the news as closed off for a domestic dispute and a shooter standoff."}
{"text":"Better than I remembered from the midwest...yum.  i had the grandma breakfast which came with smoked sausage patties, bacon and ham...pancakes, eggs and hb casserole....yummers...took away one star bcuz of the ham being a lil dry AND cold butter on the pancake....HEY BREAKFAST RESTAURANTS...ICE COLD BUTTER ON PERFECT PANCAKES RUINS THEM...ROOM TEMP PLEASE...just fyi
Great service!  Very hospitable hosts!"}
{"text":"First off the smell from the delicious board of fare that wafted through the waiting area was heaven.  We were first greeted by our hostess Brenda lynn , whom was incredibly sweet, knowledgeable and professional and personable. Then our server was soo attentive and sweet . And when I has one question about the ample catering menu they sent the manager Jason to answer my question with the best and economical path to take . THIS CRACKER BARREL IS THE BENCHMARK FOR OTHER CRACKER BARREL LOCATIONS."}
{"text":"GOOD GOOD food except there was a big black hair on my friends plate. Really ??? Then they tried to compensate; by offering us dessert. They should have comped the while meal... all good thank you anyway."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and delicious.  LOVE breakfast any time of day.  Pancakes and french toast are both the BEST (sorry Mom)! Service is great!

BUT, they really need to expand parking somehow.  It is always a bear!"}
{"text":"My first time there. Had meatloaf and sides. I loved it. We got seated right away. The gift shop is tacky. Those with kids beware. But I liked the food. Service was good.  The buttermilk biscuits are better than corn muffins."}
{"text":"Great place to eat amazing home cooking. For my husband and I to eat breakfast costs only $20. Very cheap for the amount of food they serve. I wish they offered different flavored creamer for coffee but other than that no complaints. Very tasty. Try it if you never have. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and keep returning but it has the worst and smallest parking lot of any Cracker Barrel I've ever been to.  Parking is almost always a problem.

We had a great server this time named Lou.  She went above and beyond to make sure my family had everything we needed and then some.  They have added new healthy menu items to an already excellent menu.  Our food was great as always.

I'll just deal with the parking for some great home cooked food."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a great breakfast at this location. Busy but quick to seat and they have a great system to handle the rush. Our server, Chase was attentive and friendly. I would recommend the apple cider. Tasty and comes in a frosted glass. I'd also recommend the hash brown casserole!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cracker Barrel? Ever time I come here it is always busy but that doesn't detract from the service. Servers are always friendly and food is always good. Plus their store is always fun to browse"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience. No drink refills.  Wrong food delivered once it finally showed up.  No idea who our server was.  The one that took our order went home.  The one that delivered our food never came back.  Overall unhappy."}
{"text":"Ew cracker barrel is gross AF like mcdonalds but cold and for some reason they feel the need to have servers..for what!? Diners are more high class than this joke of a restaurant.  They should just partner with retirement communities already and get it over with."}
{"text":"This cracker barrel is sort of off the grid but totally worth the odd location. The food is very good. The staff has been friendly and attentive on all occasions in my experience."}
{"text":"I used to love this place and would eat there often dealing with hour long waits.  My family loves the rocking chairs and checkers games to play while waiting.  Over the years I had noticed the quality of food was spotting with sometimes good, sometimes bad but we continued to go.  The last time we waited over an hour, the kids were tired and hungry and we were thrilled when we finally got a table.  Being they were so bust service was slow.  We waited forever for drinks and to place our order.  About 40 minutes later our food came.  My daughter was sitting next to me and my son was sitting next to my husband.  My husband has ordered a breakfast meals with everything.  He took a large piece of ham off his plate and gave it to my son.  My son took one bite and said it didn't taste good and he wasn't hungry.  Thinking he was just being difficult, I said he had to eat it.  I watched him gag through another bite and realized something was wrong.  My husband then looked at it and smelled it and the ham was BAD.  I mean really BAD like off color and smelled rotten.  I was in shock.  That could make someone really sick.  We told the waiter who was not surprised at all.  Just offered to take it back and take it off the bill and replace it??   I was shocked and really worried about my son getting sick.  The manager was not concerned and acted like I was overreacting.  
My family has never gone back but I was talking with my neighbor the other day and he said the same thing happen to him.  I am not sure how this could happen.  How does bad food get out of the kitchen?  How could no one notice?  I will never go back!"}
{"text":"This place is close to home& my boyfriend and i dine there every time we can they have fast service and amazing food, chicken fried steak is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend you avoid this restaurant at all costs. I was sad when I realized you could not give this place zero stars, so that being said I gave it one star to be generous. The food was awful, I would rather just eat gum off the side walk."}
{"text":"Forks had food on them from previous customers, 40 minutes till we received our food, loud and all crammed together. Food is disgusting. They're lucky to get one star."}
{"text":"Of all the places I have had catfish. I have to rank this place the best. Plus the service here was outstanding."}
{"text":"I never had a bad experience at this store until last week. I sat with Joanne and it went down hill from there. I asked for warm syrup for my pancakes and she replied, \"we don't have any warm syrup.\" Then went as far as picking my syrup up and and stated, \"This syrup isn't cold, if it was cold the bottle would have been cold.\" I just don't understand with a microwave, stove, oven, food warmers, and fire place why I couldn't get a bottle of warm syrup. Moral of the story, do NOT sit with Joanne."}
{"text":"The place was real busy and in cattle herding mode.  Refills were slow and they were out of a few sides.  Good for breakfast but never great when they are on a wait."}
{"text":"Good location.  Great service.  Nice to a Vegas restaurant that has good parking and even better accommodations"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is probably about the same nationwide...only visited a few.  They are consistently good for low price breakfast. We visit this one for late-night light eats We dance every Sunday night at West Coast Swing Dance club and this CB is on our way home. (better to eat after lots of dancing, instead of before)
Location is visible from I-17, however, not simple access, therefore, google map or phone for easy turns to take.

Turkey bacon is WONDERFUL!  Blueberry pancakes good with fresh berries.  Biscuits 
 fresh home made!

Rob the night manager is very helpful and kind.  Such a nice man!  Rob is African American and well deserving of management position for the long term!  I am quite shocked to see one reviewers' claim of bigotry!  We have seen Hispanic and African employees AND customers.  The atmosphere seems very accommodating for ALL!

Servers are friendly and helpful. The ladies in the gift shop are all very sweet. 

I purchased some great gifts for friends in this store! They very much liked the products I gifted!  There is so much to see...it will take time to peruse it all!

If you haven't tried Cracker Barrel...give then a try.  It's basic home style comfort food, but good for the value."}
{"text":"Not so good.  Looking for a good breakfast, thought we'd give this place a try.  Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table so spent that time looking around the store which has a number of fun and interesting things.  Once we were seated, we were rushed through our breakfast.  The quality of the food was poor...greasy and undercooked.   The atmosphere is that of a very noisy cafeteria.  Certainly, there are better places for breakfast."}
{"text":"\"\"\"Would not recommend.\"\" If I didn't have such pleasant experiences at this and other locations I would have rated one star. The wait staff are friendly that's if they decide to notice you at the table. Took us 45 min for a waitress to notice our table, after waving and yelling across the room for assistance, another 25 min to get our drinks. If this was not bad enough, our orders were not written properly and the ones that were had not been cooked correctly. Can't forget the salads that was ordered came out after meal and the bread never showed up. At the last confrontation at the end of our meal we asked about the bread and were told,\" oops, I am going to get it now. I followed with can we speak to the manager we were informed that we would have to get him ourselves about the matter. Before we left the table to cash out we went over our ticket, we were over charged for several things some that were never received. 
As we checked out I asked for the manager. We told him about our experience and received and a pat on the back apology before he walked away to attend to other things.
I have eaten at this store with family, friend, during birthdays along with other occasions for many years. I have noticed for the past two years that this store has gone down hill. I have commented several times to management and still get the same crappy service and food at this location. Not sure if I will ever go back to this location. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Cracker Barrel in search of  comfort food. The special of the day was pot roast. I chose that with Mac and cheese and fried okra. My meal was served piping hot and tasted delicious. The pot roast was so tender and juicy. My husband ordered the chicken and dumpling. At first glance, his dumpling were weirdly shaped, kind of thin. But the taste with green beans did not disappoint. The meal was tasty. So needless to say, we both got our fill of comfort food. Cracker Barrel is the best ever. Great taste and great prices.I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family and I first time here and it was an \"experience\" if I should say so myself. Where shall I start? Mmmhkay, I'll start with the positives. 

1. We LOVED the rocking chairs! I mean I literally almost bought it, but I remembered I had a small car and there was no way that was fitting in the car. Lol. So, yeah,  I kept rocking until they called my name over the loud speaker 20 minutes later when our table was ready. 

2. The staff was very friendly. Well everyone we came in contact with. 

3. The atmosphere was cool for what it was. Our server Courtney, was very nice and accommodating. 

4. The food was not that great to me AT ALL. The French toast was bland, the gravy and biscuits sucked as well. One of the kids told me the chicken strips were good. Smh. 

All and all I could've made a better breakfast at home and saved 50 bucks!"}
{"text":"Pumpkin spice pancakes! Ymmy. Love this time of the year! Quick service, everyone very friendly."}
{"text":"the place is beautiful! employees were very friendly and warm. they go out of their way to assist you and everyone I saw had a big smile on their face. I came here after my 1st class since this restaurant is close to CSN campus. Although what my friend and I ordered wasn't the best, I'd still go back to this restaurant because of the atmosphere and cute store! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, and great service. Mandy was our waitress, and she was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I love how their sign going in the front doors to the right talks about how they do not discriminate against anyone, and they go on to say what they don't discriminate against except sexual preferences, or anything that has to do with gays. Great job Cracker Barrel.. I'm sure you will be facing a law suit again soon, just like in the past."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. It has the old country kitchen type of feel. The food is pretty good one of my favorites is the brisket there. Id give it five stars but some times the food isn't cooked quite like i ordered. like ordering a medium steak and getting rare. That being said even a rare steak is a good steak. They have one of the best salads around im my opinion. they Also have a store upfront that sells everything from rocking chairs to candy bars."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sunday special which is the fried chicken breast. I got a side salad and mac and cheese as my two sides. Everything was delicious, even the biscuits! For three meals with drinks our total came out to $41. Totally cheap with huge portions. The items in the store were pretty cute too."}
{"text":"Is it me or are the portions getting smaller????  The fried apples only has 4 slices of apples.  Also, the bacon was undone."}
{"text":"Most disgusting place ever. Nasty food. Just overall horrible. Only good thing is, that it's cheap. Other than that, DONT GO THERE. Yucky."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when you're out of town...you've been driving a while... you're hungry...and then you see it.  That familiar yellow and brown sign shows up over the horizon and you get excited.  Well this isn't that middle of nowhere warm fuzzy feeling. This is the I-15 near the Vegas strip.  Keep driving. You'll be happy you did.  
When you first open the front doors the strong smell of bathroom cleaner fills the air. Forget about smelling country candles and grits.  Over used bathrooms need heavy cleaning so your nostrils get to pay the price.  
Service... forget it.  Pancakes came out cold. The only thing hot about breakfast was the syrup.  The edges of the pancakes were over done and crispy and the butter melted eons ago from sitting waiting for our waiter to summons them.  I asked for a fork. Yeah, I'm home now. Never got one.  I could have drove home and got my own fork drove back and it would have been quicker.  All the servers there look over worked and confused. My server looked like he wanted to kill someone. Thats the look he had on his face. The tables are smashed together.  Way more over crowded than any Cracker Barrel I've ever been to.  I'll continue to visit Cracker Barrel out of town. But not this one. Never again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere what more can you ask for. My family has traveled all over the country to different Cracker Barrels and they are all great. Thanks for making our family breakfast such a happy time for all of us."}
{"text":"First time here. Wifey wanted pancakes. The host that took us to our table was so rude. He didn't talk at all. Just put our menus down and walked away. Dont go to work if you dont want to be there. Then we got the food. The most bland, tasteless food i ever ate. I had better chicken at A&W. The sausage patty was like a frozen jimmy dean one. Do not come here. Go to a local restaurant better...."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6am when store opened . No one else in the place, just 2 of us. Both breakfast orders were wrong, the ham was too salty with a bad after taste to it. We were informed that the small bowl of gravy was for both of us to share after it was eaten. It was just enough to cover the 2 biscuits. When we asked for the other bowl of gravy the waitress told us that we were to split it. Reluctantly she brought another smaller bowl of gravy, not enough to cover 1 of the 2 biscuits that I had that were cold by this point. Did not receive a refill of coffee until the meal was complete. Will not comeback for breakfast."}
{"text":"Being from Tennessee we were so looking forward to Cracker Barrel coming to Vegas, but sadly disappointed! We were fine with a 2 hour wait, we brought things to keep our 3 little ones busy because it was expected with a new place. The place was so crowded inside we couldn't get our disabled son's small wheelchair through the crowd as we were being seated, and again had problems as my husband waited 30 minutes to pay the bill. We witnessed a family get their food at totally different times while waiting 40 minutes for our food. This poor woman at the next table didn't get all her food until after her husband and daughter had finished their entire meal! It looked like managers and ladies in red shirts were bringing the food out one dish at a time (the wrong food) and when the waitress reminded one of them of what she ordered the manager snapped at her so bad we were embarrassed to have our children hear it! That waitress was trying to help the customers, nobody should treat employees like that! Our food came out cold and didn't taste like what we were used to at our old CB in Tennessee. Very sad that we can't share our good experiences with this company with our children, because we will never come back! Good luck to the rest of the waiters and waitresses, we hope you are treated better than that other waitress. Our waiter Jeremy was wonderful and kept checking on us even after giving us a bill before we could even taste our food (very weird!)."}
{"text":"Not sure what the big is here wasn't that impressed ! There no way I would wait an hour to eat here we got lucky got seated in 10 min ! I wouldn't come back . No better then a cafe in house some where  .. not sure why people are lining up to eat here !"}
{"text":"The dining experience actually started pretty good. We were seated as soon as we got there. We got our initial drinks and food quite quickly but that was pretty much the last time we saw our waitress until she came to deliver the bill. We pretty had to ask her for refills as she is handing us the bill not to mention that we also had to remind her that we were missing the corn bread from our meals. Our food was less than ok. I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"We arrived on a day when they were very busy but the wait wasn't long at all. I loved how the staff made us feel welcome despite the crowd and the warm atmosphere. Amaia went above and beyond her job by making sure we had a table where we felt comfortable. Kudos Amaia and the rest of the Cracker Barrel staff!!!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has some very good food, especially for breakfast. The Sunrise Sampler is big enough to feed two people just about. I typically get that and pancakes to share with my fiancee and it fills us, for a reasonable price. Their old country store is full of candies with artificial flavors and corn syrup though -- wish they had better quality snacks but overall I like the place."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast on a Saturday. This place was a madhouse. Food was meh. I had biscuits/gravy and scrambled eggs. The person I came with had French toast. The best part of the meal was the cute bottle of warmed syrup on the side. I love the ambiance of this restaurant and the friendliness of the employees but I'll stick to dinner here if I need a Cracker Barrel fix."}
{"text":"This place is over rated.  I don't understand why the long wait not only to be seated but also to get our food.  Don't waist your time, trust me just go to a Denny's or an IHOP. The food is horrible here.  Never will I waist my time coming to this.  I had to give it a one star only because the waitress was nice"}
{"text":"This place seriously hit the spot. I ordered Mamma's Pancake Breakfast. The pancakes were so hot and fluffy, they even brought out real maple syrup no charge. I ordered my eggs over easy and they came out perfect whites cooked yellow runny, yum. When you walk in they have a full gift shop so we even got some last minute Christmas presents on the way out. The server was very friendly and even  my iced tea to go. All in all it was delicious and we will be back."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast a little earlier to avoid the rush.... Well,we avoided good service as well! I believe bad service starts with management- so shame on you Cracker Barrel.
Not good service, food was bland.Totally disappointed.Guess we will have to visit the Cracker Barrel in Ohio to get the great experience we are used to.( Pancakes were great though)"}
{"text":"I don't know if I'll ever go back to this location. The food is good, what we expect from Cracker Barrel. The service was something a lot less. The two times we went our server was a older gentlemen named Gerry or Gerald I believe. Service was really slow. He always seemed like he was more interested in watching other tables instead of us when he came around. I did not get a drink refill until the end of the meal after my wife said something. We did not getting any biscuits even though we had asked for some. First visit he apologized blaming large groups for the delay. Funny thing, both times  the restaurant was not even half full. I would give the service 1 star."}
{"text":"I came to this place earlier today and I do have to say that the gift shop right next to it is so lovely they wall decorations and the people are so nice. The breakfast itself was ok I'd recommend the fried steak and gravy because that was honestly the best along with the hash-brown casserole. I wasn't the most delighted with the eggs though they were a bit undercooked while the bacon was over cooked. I don't really recommend the Fresh starter breakfast because the muffin didn't really taste like wow! It was more of a meh type muffin. In conclusion everyone is so nice and I would really recommend the fried steak and gravy."}
{"text":"I love this place. I'm from California and we don't have Cracker Barrel. Every time I'm in Arizona, this is always my first stop. The service and food are great. My children love to play checkers while they wait for their meal and then we always enjoy shopping in the country store afterwards."}
{"text":"Food was super yum, biscuits were great(as always). There was no enthusiasm on the waitresses face though."}
{"text":"We went yesterday.  We knew we would have a wait.  Was told it would be a 1 hour and 15 minute wait.  But I think it was only about 45 minutes.  The food was really good.  While we waited they brought in 2 big water misting fans! That made the wait outside a little nicer.  We are for sure going back soon."}
{"text":"Always good food and fast service for breakfast, lunch or dinner!  Had rainbow trout with salad and mac & cheese - yum!"}
{"text":"I went in hear how amazing this place was, only to puke before I left. I ordered the chicken and dumplings with cole slaw and fried okra. The cole slaw was pretty good, but the okra was soggy! How do you screw up something so easy?! The chicken tasted like they took it straight from a McDonald's trash can! The gravy and dumplings....the slop they tried saying was gravy and dumplings made me puke. I literally almost didn't make it in the toilet. The waitress was horrid. She came by 5 times in less than 2 minutes wanting us to decide what we want. Then disappeared after giving us our food. If I could give negative stars I would. I called the health department, as this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"The food is always constant in all Cracker Barrels. The problem comes when you order take out. Always check your food before you leave the restaurant. Most of the times they get the side orders wrong. Bathrooms need some cleaning too."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store of Robinson is the place to indulge. As I walked in, the aura of a rural atmosphere hit me like a train. Their menu contains food reminiscent of ole-time rural meals. Don't be fooled, though; any dish here is guaranteed to stuff you to the brim. Stuff you to the brim with deliciousness, that is. Today I ordered the \"chicken n dumplins\" with two sides: macaroni and cheese, and broccoli. It is safe to say this meal touched every corner of the ole-time country style.

The service, however, is a bit shaky. As the hostess took us to our table, I suspected that things, employee-wise, were not completely organized. All in all, I strongly recommend Cracker Barrel Old Country Store for those who wish to experience a superb recreation of those ole country vibes."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years in Phoenix and I grew up going to Cracker Barrel. Tonight was not a pleasant experience at all. The server was nice and mostly attentive. The food was pretty good. However, I paid for a sundae dessert and they were out of hot fudge- the only topping I like. After agreeing to that so my daughter could share it, I noticed the bill was almost $30 for a kids meal, adult meal and 2 drinks. Then, I see why- my daughter got an egg with her kids pancake meal and we were charged for a one egg meal for $3.40 in addition to $6.20 for her kids pancake. If I had been told up front it wasn't a small additional charge, I would have ordered an adult meal. I was informed at the register that it was because it didn't come with an egg. Last time we will come here for awhile because I won't be duped anymore."}
{"text":"I thought the waitress was kidding when she brought my chicken fried chicken meal. I looked like a child's portion. Hardly any mashed potatoes and barely any gravy on the steak or potatoes. My 4 yr old son loves hamburgers but he didn't want to finish his because it was too dry. I'm only speaking for what I ordered but Bill Johnson's Big Apple portions are much better. The okra and biscuits were awesome though."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast on 6/18/2017 to celebrate my Mothers birthday, being that it is was fathers day they were very busy. We arrived at 830am the hostess informed us that if we chose to sit all together (party of 11) it would be and hour and 10 min or if we did  split it would be 50 min. I asked what she meant by split? She said two tables back to back, I said okay I can put my young children at the table behind us, so we opted for the split. At 9:12 they called us and had two tables across the room from each other, that was not what she said and that was not an option since I had young children. She then said about 25 minutes more for the wait, we said ok and at 9:25 they called for a party of 10 that was seated all together. This party only waited 20 min and was seated. We spoke to the manager who admitted when we declined the tables across the room the POS system placed us back on the bottom of the list and the hostess should of realized that we should have been seated before the party of 10. He asked what he could do to make this right and my husband asked for a discount. The manager said he would do the best he can. We were finally seated at 9:50, service was fine although the waiter took our food order immediately and apologized for our inconvenience but forgot to get our drink order. When our bill came no discount was taken we spoke to the General Manager and asked about our discount, he responded by saying you were seated 11 min past the time told why would we discount. Never mind that your hostess misinformed us, never mind that you seated a large party like ours first, never mind everything that transpired during our hour and 20 min wait. All he cared about was that we were seated 11 min past the time we were promised. If we were seated 11 min past our time that would of been at 9:31 from the original 50 minutes we were told."}
{"text":"Guys it's Cracker Barrel - if you're not having a good time you either didn't know what Cracker Barrel is, or you're ordering the wrong stuff.

It's a breakfast place, so as soon as you sit down just give them the lunch menu back, because you don't want anything on it.  Then, open up the breakfast menu and find 'Uncle Hershels Breakfast' and order that.  Then eat it.  That's pretty much all you have to do.

If you actually haven't been to a Cracker Barrel before, then know this: There are about 1000 of them, and they're a country restaurant and a store that sells candy and beanie babies and a whole bunch of garbage that only an old person would want, but nobody's forcing you to buy the stuff, so just eat the breakfast and get over it."}
{"text":"Good service, but the food was atrocious. It tastes like everything was cooked in butter; my food was either tasteless or very greasy. Ive been here twice and had deplorable food both times."}
{"text":"We wanted something nearby yet different from our usual spots and Cracker Barrel was the solution.  We enjoyed the country store and I bought a charming \"made with love\" spoon rest.  The store is well stocked and is worth the visit by itself. The menu was a nice variety of basic southern style dishes. The best part to me is the large variety of side dishes. I could eat them instead of a meal, especially the mac and cheese and the baked apples. My chicken dumplings were a little heavy on the dough, but the roast beef was tender and the Sunday chicken dinner special was great. The waitress was friendly and the wait for food was reasonable."}
{"text":"First yelp review, but honestly the food was good I have the blueberries pancakes with egg whites and beacon. It did not disappoint me. But the only reason I do have a complaint about is the service. You have about 10 workers around and it's not busy at all it took 10 minutes to get a refill of coffee and only because I asked a different server. Once we got coffee refilled it took another 5 minutes to get it refilled."}
{"text":"Not sure where to begin. To start there is a 1 hour minimum wait to get our table. When we finally got our table the nightmare of a server took our orders and then we proceeded to wait 45 minutes for our food. We had a 1 year old with us and they didn't bother to give him a roll or anything while he waited. Needless to say his mom and baby left as he couldn't wait another minute! Once our food came it was all messed up, no sides, missing parts of the order etc. There were at least 8 \"workers\" just standing around who could have easily monitored quality control. The manager checked in with us way too late and offered us complimentary Mac and cheese, but it was too little too late. This joint is not prepared for the amount of people wanting to eat here. We LOVE the Cracker Barrel franchise, but this location is a BUST! Overcrowded, clueless, and a waste of our time!"}
{"text":"Typical Cracker Barrel.  Lots of people but we were seated fairly quickly.  Service was good, noise level was about average but it was quiet enough to have a conversation despite the place being packed.  Food was typical breakfast food a la grill, large portions.  Since when do you get an individual bottle of syrup -or- a side?  
Parking was fine, this one is conveniently by the stadium so there are parking lots and large stores everywhere.   Would I go back?  Probably."}
{"text":"Great service by ZACH awesome service ever at this location thank you for making my party of 10 feel at home. Food was awesome"}
{"text":"I always get sick to my stomach after eating here. Ugh. I gave it one too many chances. And it's not even like it makes me sick but the service is great, no it's all just terrible! Don't eat here unless you need to barf for some reason. Lol."}
{"text":"My family and I have always had a good meal at this Cracker Barrel. The food is good Homestyle food that we all enjoy. My daughter and husband got the bacon burger and would definitely order that again. I got the Haddock and mac & cheese which was very delicious. I think they have the best mac & cheese. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The establishment is clean. The country store is always fun to explore. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This restaurant was Amazing!!! They have all day breakfast,Amazing food,and even a old country store,which is why it is called \"Cracker Barrel Old country store\" I would recommend for ANYBODY to come here"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite places to grab dinner from if it's been a hectic day . The customer service is always very friendly and helpful . I would recommend this chain if you enjoy casual eating placed in a comfy country themed dinning setting.  The food is always very well done and as for pricing it won't make your wallet feel too bad either ;)"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location!!!!!!!!!
 They are lacking service and done seem to be concerned about their customers. I ordered a meal and I got orange juice with black little things that look like nats. When I got my meal it was not the way I ordered it. Then they took half back and the other half of my order got cold and when they brought my meal back  the eggs were all watery and they weren't as I ordered them. Then when I was about to eat my toast I asked for them to be toasted extra and was slightly Brown on one side I said okay and I turned it over it was all mushy. The entire breakfast was wrong and took forever. I spoke to a manager and all he said was I'm sorry tapped the chair and walked away. Whaaaaat really!!!! I wish I can attach a photo of the guy bussing the tables. He stood by the people eating with all the dirty dishes just waiting for someone to get up you don't stand there with dirty dishes and waiting in the middle of everybody. Then when I left I asked to speak to the manager other than the one I spoke to they said okay. Who came out??? The same manager and he asked well we we reordered everything we custom made it for U. I told him I didn't appreciate him saying I'm sorry and tapping the chair and walking away not even offering a free meal a percentage off or coming the meal for the inconvenience of me being late to work. He said well I'll take care of it like he was angry with me. What heck really?!?!?!  Not an inviting place at alllllllll!!!!! I will be taking my business to the other location on Craig."}
{"text":"Visited on a Sunday morning around 10:30...hour and forty-five minute wait for a party of two. Decided to place a to go order. More than half of the side dishes that came with the meal were missing. Won't go back."}
{"text":"I still love Cracker Barrel but word to the wise do not order food to go from here!!   I waited more than 45 minutes for a to go order!   Heck I waited so long I forgot what  I ordered!!!  The food was cold and it was hard as a rock!  $26 for 2 meatloaf dinners and a house salad was too much!!!  They will still get my business but only for dine in and only for breakfast!!  Sorry Cracker Barrel but you ruined dinner for me."}
{"text":"Sadly, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. The biscuits were dry and cold, the food had no flavor, and the fish was very undercooked. My husband had grits with his breakfast items and I didn't believe it was possible to mess these ups...... but horrible! I was very disappointed with everything."}
{"text":"We go here rarely.  I do not enjoy the rickety wooden chairs sliding on a tile floor.  I ordered the chicken dinner.  It came with 3 pieces of chicken.  The first 2 were dry and the 3rd I couldn't even put a knife or fork through it. 
The server told me she'd bring another piece of chicken but I turned it down for a side of cole slaw that I was told would run 2.79 if ordered separately. I really do not plan to go back as I do not see what the attraction is."}
{"text":"Always a good meal, have never been dissatisfied! First time I went was on a road trip alone to Tucson after that I was sold. Took my husband maybe a year later and Cracker Barrel had been a favorite ever since!"}
{"text":"First time to a Cracker Barrel! I'm from Texas and love 'down home' food! This was fantastic! Good strong coffee! Good water! I had the Moms French toast plate with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs. Although I could not finish all of it, it definitely tasted great! The butter was tasty and the little souvenir like jars of maple syrup were one of the bests! Eggs were cooked properly and turkey sausage was seasoned just enough! My husband had the Moms pancake plate, with sausage patty and scrambled eggs with cheese. His sausage patty tasted like a summer sausage link, real good! The atmosphere was very fun! Wish I had my son with us today, he would of loved it. They also have an old fashioned gift store that we ventured into and found some goodies to take home and share. Try this place. I bet it gets pretty busy, but it's also quite big so I can't see ya waitin too long :)"}
{"text":"I love their hashbrown casserole! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is bc it was on the dry side. Maybe I got the crispy part, who knows, but I will be back to try again  I had their old timers breakfast and mamas french toast breakfast. ****updated**** My food was not good. C'mon guys, please do better. I ordered the Cracker Barrel Sampler. The food tasted like you guys made it 3 days ago. I was so disappointed bc I really wanted to give you guys that extra star you were missing from my last review. Instead I took away two stars. I don't know if I will ever be back."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I have ever had.  Ordered biscuits and gravy with sausage.  Gravy not hot and had to ask for more and still not enough to cover biscuits and sausage. Was not breakfast sausage but some dry beef stick. Never again."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town, hands down.  They also have some hard to find treats like country fried chicken.  The country store is always fun to look through as well.  For what they do, they do it well.  I do wish they had beer and the seating could be improved, but if you want a good home style meal and that's all you care about, this place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"This morning I drove out to meet my son and his family for breakfast. This review is about a particular employee and not so much about the food. Upon arriving at this location and getting out of my car I could smell the cigarette smoke. My spot was about 25 feet from the entrance of the restaurant and it looks like a giant ashtray. I had to walk through a group of five people smoking in front of the entrance. Now I realize its their right to smoke and really none of mine business, except when they are crowd around the path to the door. I thought it must be busy and the smokers are out side waiting. I was wrong. There was no waiting. my son hadn't arrived so I looked around their country store. A very nice lady at the register asked if she could help me? So I took the opportunity to let her know of the group of smokers just outside their door next to the \"No Smoking\" sign. She apologized and said she will let the manager on duty know. I thanked her and returned to walking around the store. I looked over to the register and noticed this gentleman approach the register. You could tell the nice lady was passing on my concern of the group smoking at the entrance. You could tell by the man's gestures and the way he threw his arms in the air and shrugged his shoulders that he wasn't concerned. Several minutes past and he must of had a change of heart, because he walked out the door. Thats all he did. He didn't approach the people at all. He walked back in made a comment to the register lady about no one is smoking. Seriously? Because right after he came in everyone started another cigarette. 
Now some may think this is petty, but it's the law and restricted smoking areas. It's really about this person, Associate Manager (Tim) total disregard to this matter and his rude reaction to me upon my son's family arrival. Tim decided to batter with me while we walked towards our table to be seated. I found this person to be unprofessional and very rude. 
This was just my second visit to Cracker Barrel and prior to today its been 12 years,  the food is just okay.
Now the rest of the staff I came in contact with were very pleasant and helpful!!! Maybe the GM Dave Mann should have Tim train with our waitress Kimberly. She hopefully help him with his poor people and customer service skills."}
{"text":"After being ignored down the street by Arribas Mexican grill, we enjoyed the spicy grilled catfish and the chicken fried steak, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great place for that comfort food craving!  Fried okra and haddock can't be beat!  Hubby says they've got the best green beans in Arizona......except for mine! Service was great, prompt and efficient."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Gave our table away to the wrong people and was rude when we asked when we were up. Made me my pregnant wife and my 3 year old wait for nothing but being treated rudely by the woman seating people. I would skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food! Neat atmosphere. Large parking lot. When you walk in, you enter through a gift shop country store first. It's filled with a lot of old fashioned toys, some souvenir type stuff, candles, clothes, and other unique items...pretty cute. Then the restaurant is decorated with a ton of antiques, old photos, and a giant fireplace. They have checkers tables while you're waiting and little peg jump games at each table. It's not too loud, but a little crowded. A lot of elderly people must enjoy coming here...they had their walkers all parked around the fireplace. But anyway, the waiter, the hostess, the manager, they were all exceedingly nice! And the food, (I had the fried chicken, she had the dumplings plus choice of 3 veggies) was excellent! I couldn't stop eating! No room for dessert. But, I'll definitely be back! Not too overpriced either. Oh and great biscuits and cornbread!"}
{"text":"It was cute. The inside was nice. But that's as much as I could say. After 30 minuets of waitig we asked the  host how much long. She said soon. After waiting an hour she said we were next. 30 minutes later we had still not been seated. So we left."}
{"text":"First time ever at Cracker Barrel's and the last time also.  Went there for Breakfast, Sausage was cold, Porkchops dry, pancakes undercooked, gravy was like paste Hashbrown dry and cold must have been from the previous day.  When I brought it to the Managers attention he cut me off.  We ended up paying for food that was not eadable.  Waitress was friendly and very apologetic.  Very disappointing.  If I could they would get no stars.  I wrote an online complaint and heard nothing back.  Bad Customer Service!!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the Turkey dinner, and chicken fried steak. Chicken fried steak was \"soggy\", and tasted horrible. 2 Turkey dinners, and both dishes were served cold. The only thing somewhat edible, was the coleslaw, as it tastes fine when cold. To add to the experience, the Chicken Fired steak was served exactly how I asked it NOT to be, and the mashed potatoes for the 2 Turkey dinners never showed up. The waiter never refilled my Wife's drink, no checked to see if she needed a refill. I asked 3 different times for condiments for the sides, only to receive them after I asked the third time. The kitchen staff, and management are clearly over taxed on anything more than 10% occupancy. we couldn't count the number of people who were in line with complaints over their orders. I WILL NOT ever consider going to this place again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love Cracker Barrel. I gave it three tries. But unfortunately they just do not come through with flying colors. All three occasions my food has been either undercooked, overcooked and always bland. The wait staff was very personable but really doesn't know how to be a wait staff. On this last trip the waiter forgot one beverage, removed our salt shaker and sugar even though they were both full to refill them while we were eating (and took a while to return them, as he was carrying a tray of silverware after he removed them) and never checked to see if we needed any refills on our beverages or even asked how the food was. The only time we saw him was to give us our check. He didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. That seems to be a practice there at Cracker Barrel. So, in my experience, the food has been consistently mediocre."}
{"text":"I honestly am not sure why this place is so popular. The food is terrible. The only good thing about the place is the country store."}
{"text":"Waited over 45 minutes for 2 people that was the worst part.  Food came out in a decent time, tasted good, price was good.  They have been open for 2 weeks so they still are learning.  When the crowd goes away and you can get seated in less than 20 minutes I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes EVER! I kid you not when I say this. So delicious and buttery. Me and my boyfriend had breakfast here. Our server Brian came to our table a little late and I think another server tried to swoop his table haha. He sort of talked over my boyfriend and I and focused on bigger parties that he had. We also had to remind him to bring us things we asked. Other than that food came out fast and was really good! Would definitely come back again for the pancakes."}
{"text":"I was here tonite, too!  Enjoyed the braised pork and tried turnip greens for the first time. My family was pleasantly surprised also by the food, service and value. We haven't been to a CB in quite awhile, but will be back soon.  The store was well stocked with fun items for Christmas."}
{"text":"Hit or miss on the service. The food is the same as all other locations in the chain. Store area that your forced to wait in while waiting for a table had stalkers for sales people. I considered waiting outside to get away but it's December and cold. Will try them again when it's warmer."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was okay and the service was great but their parking lot surveillance needs to be improved.  When we returned to our car in the parking lot about an hour after we entered the restaurant (in day light), we found that a car window was broken and our luggage was stolen.  The sheriff indicated that this was a common occurrence at this site. He was there enough to know that our parking spot was not covered by security equipment.  The manager just shook his head as if to say \"yes\" when he saw that we had out of state license plates on our rental car."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here since they opened, and I always get a breakfast no matter what time it is. I love the cheddar hashbrown casserole, it is divine. I've enjoyed their country store and have bought numerous Yankee candles and once an adorable Pirate costume for one of my kids. I have to say though, if you are browsing around the country store expect an employee to hover over you the whole time, lol. My sons enjoy the little wooden games that are on the tables and also playing checkers (nice that they offer those). Service is almost always very friendly and prompt. Avoid coming here on Sundays after church though, it is a madhouse."}
{"text":"We have been here twice.  The first time it was a lot going wait but we expected that. The second time it was only 10 minutes.  The food was great and love looking through the store while we wait.  The breakfast was delicious and then we had dinner.  The pot roast was great and the mac and cheese was fresh and cheesy!  My husband had the sampler plate and he enjoyed it! Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I eat at cracker barrel all the time, but I was not impressed by this location. Food was greasy and service was slow."}
{"text":"We love their food. But the service was unpleasant. The waiter almost drop our plates at the table and didn't ask for refills.
This had happen in the other location in Arrowhead (Bell Rd)."}
{"text":"I've been going to CBs for a LONG time & typically love it. This one is very small, very crowded, very loud, and I'm very disappointed. The food was also lacking the typical CB quality. Save your $$ & time and head somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Cute shop, excellent customer service, always welcomed in with a warm smile. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because the wait for food can be a little long at times, but it's definitely the best family friendly shop in buckeye. The kiddos love all the knickknacks in the store."}
{"text":"Was in town from Boston, and had my first Cracker Barrel breakfast here.  

Yes, it's a chain.  Yes, it's kitschy.  The environment is very \"olde-tymey\" and cute, but the food is pretty great!  The servers were terrific, the coffee good, and the juices (both OJ and grapefruit) were fresh squeezed.

For *less than $4* you could get some hash brown casserole (baked with cheese and onions mmm), a bowl of fried apples (buttery, not too mushy, and tart enough to balance the sweet), and two flaky biscuits.  Unbelievable values on the menu.

Had the pancakes on another visit - perhaps a touch too buttery, but absolutely delicious, just the right balance of hearty and sweet.  Good bacon too!

Classic food, delivered simply with a smile, for a great price.

If I lived nearby I'd be coming back, a lot."}
{"text":"Food's good, homestyle comfort food, nothing fancy-just how I like it. Nice waitresses, food came quick considering how busy it was and was reasonably priced
One thing I really don't like is how I have to walk clear through the entire gift shop to get to the food. I get it, I get it, you want me to by your crap and nik naks...but really I find it off-putting when you force a retail experience on me, and it actually works against you when you try and crowd me into buying something.

I'd go back. Wouldn't go out of my way though."}
{"text":"This establishment refused to serve me because of my white skin. Apparently this Cracker Barrel doesn't serve crackers.
Coming to North Carolina for the first time from CAlifornia   And experienced racism at its finest. 
So excited to see a Cracker Barrel after flying in! We were seated by a nice older woman right away in an empty room except for one couple eating. We were passed over 10x and never even asked if we needed a drink. Maybe they were busy I was thinking? Nope. A group of people got sat in our room and were served within minutes. Drinks. Food. We were still never even asked for drinks?  
At this point I am confused. We are given dirty looks by both servers working the floor. Confused turned understanding when over 20 minutes went by and it just wasn't worth it anymore. All 3 woman on the floor were African American and clearly didn't want to serve a white couple. As the servers were talking amongst themselves snickering we decided to leave. The nice woman in the front was upset when we let her know after all that time they refused to serve us. Not ONE word spoken by the staff in the 30 min total we were there except for sweet hostess. 

This shit still happens in America? Wtf is wrong with people?? Trying to have a nice breakfast to only be reminded racism is everywhere no matter what color you are.  Oh and for the record you are working at an establishment with a white guy on your sign.....

Southern hospitality does not exists here."}
{"text":"Service at this location is amazing. My glass was never empty and my waiter was able yo read our needs without interrupting our conversation/meal.  The wait staff was polite and very professional.

Cracker Barrel food is all comfort food to me. I love the home-cooked feeling. I was a little disappointed with the fresh apple slices. I love fruit, especially apples. There was almost no apple flavor to them, and what I could taste in its place was weird. I absolutely love that fresh fruit is an option as a side. I wish more places served fruit. The rest of the meal was amazing. The macaroni needed pepper to really make it sing, but the chicken fried chicken was seasoned perfectly!

I would visit this location again."}
{"text":"We came at a very busy time. Our waitress was very busy, so another waitress came over and helped us out. She was the best part of our experience here. The food is always amazing,  but it was so nice for Teddie to go above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of. Her customer service is impeccable and we were greatful to have her help us. Thank you Teddie!!!  You are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel!  It's my favorite chain restaurant and I stop in as often as I can. They give you hearty helpings of fantastic comfort food, have a great homey atmosphere and a cute store with all kinds of seasonal and novelty items. Their lunch and dinner meals are my favorite but breakfast is good too."}
{"text":"Great for what it is.... well priced, hearty southern cooking in a casual environment. The chicken and dumplings are my favorite! The apple butter is also really good.. but you'll have to ask for it, because they don't automatically bring out with biscuits. There's a cute gift shop at the entrance, which makes the wait time easier to deal with."}
{"text":"We come here all the time but tonight dinner was awful. The food was fine it was the service we received from Tyrone.. my husband ordered a Bacon cheese Burger and I the trout dinner. We sat there with empty drinks for 10min and when the food came out they brought my husband a Patty and fries... and I got one fillet of trout instead of the two it was to come with. My husband said it was to be a Bacon cheeseburger and they brought him out a plain cheeseburger.. he ate it but was done with the service. Upon paying at the register when my husband was explaining how dinner was bad, Tyrone walked up and said oh I rang it up wrong as a hamburger steak, but  I can charge you the the real price instead of saving you a dollar like I did you know. My husband paid and was like wow really who says this?? So yea dinner was a disaster we got one refill our entire wrong meal.."}
{"text":"Expectations far from met. Breakfast selection looked ok from the menus standpoint, but came out looking tired and weak. Was so unfullfilling, literally,  that it seemed more like a bad appetizer more than a meal. Service slow, forgot cheese on my omelet, and spilled the gritz when the food arrived. To top it off, had to wait in a ridiculously small line that that took 10 mins to pay. Wont be back. The Silverton location is so much better."}
{"text":"Food and Service were Great! we had the Pumpkin Pancakes with real maple syrup not the fake stuff most Resturants serve! Scrambled egg with salsa and bacon.:) Server was fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Cracker Barrel. I always come here when I see the Angels for Spring Training. 

I like checking out the \"Country Store\". I see a lot of stuff here I don't normally see.

Service at the restaurant is hit and miss. Sometimes I've had great service while other times it's been pretty slow.

I really like the atmosphere/decor of the restaurant.

Food is just ok. Pretty reasonable prices.

Save room for the coke cake. It's worth trying!"}
{"text":"It's always Delish!! The pancakes are The best!!!  My mother flipped over the grits, and we ate from NY!!  LoL. Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"Loved it here! Never ever had Cracker Barrel. We Ordered steak and eggs and it came with two biscuits and grits each and we ordered two pancakes and our check total was only $22! Good southern comfort food this is the perfect place for. Service was amazing and the managers frequently checked on us and the plates were cleared off quick. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. Decent portions and speedy service. I just not too fond of the paper menus that looks old and dirty."}
{"text":"Those looking for the down home quality you get when visiting this brand of establishment in the Southeast US will be sadly disappointed when dining here. The food is blah, portions are big but flavor is lacking. Service is beyond slow. We arrived at 2pm on a Tuesday afternoon. The place certainly was not full yet it was way understaffed. I found 2 long hairs in my corn. Disgusting. Hair nets anyone?"}
{"text":"Horrible.   Everything was cold except the grease pouring out of the chicken fried steak.   Burned my mouth and left nasty taste in it.  Service was ok but food very sub par"}
{"text":"I ordered the \"Grandpas country fried steak breakfast\" and a strawberry lemonade in the afternoon and the food was quite soggy. I went home an hour later and immediately vomitted as my stomach was very upset. After evacuating everything out of my stomach it was no longer upset. I will not eat there again. Any restaurant can say that food poisoning takes longer than an hour to cause a person to be sick but that is not true. There is no time limitation as to how fast a person can feel or become sick from tainted food or drink."}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on their breakfast menu. Pretty cool atmosphere. Half of the place is an \"antique\" store with old candies and memorabilia. The other half is a restaurant. You walk in and can smell the fire burning in this huge fireplace. The staff was super friendly and prompt. I had the breakfast sampler, wife had the egg in a basket and the kids had the pancakes and French toast. 
The good: the hashbrown cass role is bomb. It's made with cheese, cream of chicken soup, and something else. Whatever it is it's great. The pancakes were delicious partly due to the syrup. It's a combination of real maple syrup and sugar. No fake stuff here folks. The biscuits and gravy was delicious as well. You can tell everything was made from scratch. They have fried apples. It's like eating the apple pie filling without the crust. It was different but good. 
The OK: the bacon could've been cooked a little longer. It was a little too flimsy for my taste. The grits were kinda watery. The sausage patty was dry and kinda tasteless. 
Overall I'd definitely eat there again because the hashbrown casserole and biscuits are worth it alone."}
{"text":"After a 20 minute car ride and 20 minute wait for a table (on a Monday), I'd have to say the food was average...I was expecting a bit more from all the hype surrounding this place. But, you do get plenty for your dollar and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel.  They serve good home cooked meals at good prices.  I've had just about everything on the menu except liver and it is all good.  The cheese-potatoes and the baked apple are great sides.   I like to get there \"grilled\" toast whenever I have breakfast there."}
{"text":"Not the greatest food but it is what you expect and they deliver on that.  I had the chicken fried steak which was meh but my daughter had the special fried chicken which was boneless and it was delicious.  The staff was very nice and service was good."}
{"text":"And the only reason I gave it two stars was the fact that our waitress was on the ball and felt so bad that I had to return my steak 4 times. The manager there, when the place gets busy, is well in over his head. I doubt that we will go back anytime soon or at least not on a sunday for lunch."}
{"text":"My son never behaves in a restaurant. That's why I don't consider Cracker Barrel  a typical restaurant. He Is fascinated by all the little gifts in the welcome store."}
{"text":"First time eating at Cracker Barrel! Pancakes, eggs and sausage were everything I thought they would be- delicious! McKenzie was our waitress and she was on point with excellent customer service with a smile! Wife and kids enjoyed their food as well. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"My parents and I have tried several times to give this location a chance, but this is likely the last time we come here. We had to ask for our biskets and when they came they were hard like hockey pucks. We did get more that were a little more edible. This is not the first time we have gotten hard bisects.  After waiting for a long time for our food the server came out and told me they were out of the chicken tenders I ordered. I ordered the hamburger steak that was inedible. My moms steak was also inedible. 
The only good thing about this visit was our server Sydney. She was great."}
{"text":"Hostesses need to be trained on giving correct times. Told 20 minutes for a table when we came in. Came back after 20 minutes, she says, \"it will be about 20 minutes\". I told her she just told me that 20 minutes ago, her response was \"more people popped up on the list\"....... how does that make sense?"}
{"text":"I went to this cracker barrel once,the food was okay, nothing spectacular. They dont give you enough food. Anyway, after we ate we went the gift shoppe, my mom is in a wheel chair. And as soon as we got in there, looking around,they came with extra employees talking on the walki talkies and watching us like we gonna steal somthing. My mom is almost 90 in a wheel chair.we are part black/part hispanic .we felt so uncomfortable , we will never go back. Thats the problem with most of these restaurants .they stare at you,like we cant eat there. Next it will be back to the old days, Colored eat in the rear!"}
{"text":"Ate here once. Ordered biscuits and lemonade. The biscuits were amazing...flaky, buttery, And the lemonade was just the perfect combination of sweet and sour. But, I couldn't control myself around those biscuits and lemonade. 6 biscuits, 4 lemonades, and 20 minutes later, my stomach was UPSET. Highly recommend restaurant but I must warn you all that Moderation is key with the biscuits and lemonade. Didn't leave bathroom for 30 minutes. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food were great when they first opened , but it went downhill from there on . The last time we ate there was on my birthday , Feb.14 . It wasn't busy , and no one lining up . We waited for 1 1/2 hours for our food , and it came cold and dry . My medium steak was overcooked and dry , the baked potatoes were cold inside , as my son says. My ever favorite dumplings looked like it's been heated up way too many times . We didn't even realized it took that long , because of our cell phones . The waitress apologized, but never offered anything , until we were ready to leave . The manager offered an ice cream to go . We didn't make a big deal of it to complain about our food ,and wait another 1 1/2 more wait . It was ridiculous. Never going back there again , unless to shop retail . The two stars were for the atmosphere , and I give the retail section a 4 stars . They need to change the managers and chef ."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE breakfast places! It's so cozy, and the staff is wonderful. The Blueberry lemon stuffed french toast is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Always love coming to Cracker Barrel. Predictably good and tasty. Always breakfast all day.  And friendly attentive staff"}
{"text":"I tried this place when I went to Arizona to visit my brother and this time my brother came tovisit and we went to Vegas after Christmas with the family and of course on our way back home had to come eat here... no matter where this chain of restaurants they always have a long wait but very much worth the wait... love the store in front and we did some shopping as we waited ... service was good and food was delicious and even had some take home due to big portions served... loved their blueberry muffins and yogurt parfait.... will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Cracker Barrel.  The store and the old fashioned merchandise you can buy is definitely a draw.

I've been to this location numerous times, and I am always pleased.  The service has never been sub-par...they are always attentive and have a good attitude. I am a big fan of the fried shrimp, as well as the pot roast.  The choices of side dishes are amazing, and I'm partial to the fried okra.  The ranch style salad dressing is particularly good here for some reason too.  The Stewart's old-fashioned soda pop (orange-and-cream for me, thanks!) comes in a glass bottle, along with a frosted glass to pour it in.  And for me, there's nothing better than apple dumplings à la mode for dessert.  

I am a huge fan of Cracker Barrel, and of this location in particular.  Great place."}
{"text":"I ordered a breakfast for me and my husband yesterday. The girl who took my order was not pleasant at all and I kinda felt like I was inconveniencing her by calling. She told me that it would be ready in about 10 minutes. I asked if she could wait 10 minutes before putting my order in and she gave a long pause and said okay. When my husband got there to pick up the food the front desk lady had to call for the food to be brought up twice. After 25 minutes he asked for the manager. The lady at the front desk told him she didn't think the manager should get involved. He told her it had been almost a half hour and wanted to know where our food was. The manager came up and took care of the order but didn't explain what happened. When my husband got the food back to the hotel everything except the grits was room temperature. Our hotel is less then 5 minutes away from the restaurant. I was so disappointed. I call the restaurant and asked for the manager. She told me (which she didn't tell my husband) that the girl who took my order never put it in because when I asked her to wait 10 minutes before putting it in she forgot. I told her I understand that but if you put in the order after my husband arrived why isn't it hot! The biscuits were hard as a rock, the hashbrown casserole was dry and hard the bacon and eggs were cold and the biscuits and gravy was flavor less. The manager asked me what she could do to make it right? I told her we would be in town for one more night and I wanted a new breakfast the next morning, she said absolutely and agreed to a new breakfast. When I got there the next day it took about a half hour but this time everything was hot! The  biscuits were soft, food had flavor and everything was delicious! The manager Alla was a pleasure to deal with and the next time we are in town we will consider visiting again."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of those places, which, for me, falls under the heading of \"Comfort Food\".  To be sure, portions are far from small and typically American ... as in \"America in the 1960s\", when breakfast meant three eggs, pancakes, sausage, ham or bacon, toast, and enough butter to paint the walls of a restaurant yellow.  And Cracker Barrel does its best to carry on that tradition.  This is NOT the place to go to to eat healthy; and I'd wager, Black Bear Diner has healthier meals.  If you're a diabetic or a vegetarian, this is the place to go to commit suicide.  Apparently, 70-80% of Arizona's sugar imports go to this restaurant and I'm almost positive I saw a truck filled with cows being delivered to the rear of the building.  (Of course, I jest:  everyone knows they consume so much meat here, they have their own slaughterhouse on premises).

If your blood sugar level hasn't shot up to 600 reading this and your personal trainer hasn't slapped you for looking at this page, then you'll be happy(?) to know, that the food here is tasty, plentiful and will only likely put 2 or 3 pounds on your hips by meal's end.

Service is usually attentive and polite.  There's nothing to fault the place as far as attitude and professionalism is concerned  (and isn't the lobby with all those cute knick-knacks just the bees' knees?!).

If President Obama and First Lady Michelle have their way and Americans are compelled to actually exercise and do their part to cut down on medical costs, places like Cracker Barrel will go the way of the Pony Express and 29 Cent a gallon gas.  For now, enjoy the blast into the past and the extra dose of cholestorol meds you'll need after eating dinner here."}
{"text":"Had the Hamburger Steak, eggs, hash browns with biscuits and gravy. Pretty good stuff, especially after a plane ride from Maui, Hawaii.

Shana, our server, was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Visited on 8/12/2014 about mid-morning.  We had a great time.  Very impressed with the employees.  They seem to really like working here.  They are extremely courteous and were concerned that we had a good experience.  Great place."}
{"text":"As soon as we sat down the waiter said \"im off in 10 minutes, i cant wait\" wow, there is a way to start a meal!

food is bland. had to grab a waiter for refills. my waiter would come over, sigh very loud and ask if needed anything else. 

wont come back because the food and service sucked!"}
{"text":"Wintering from the Midwest we were familiar with Cracker Barrel and went for breakfast to see if their mid-American tradition held.  Being new to the smart phone crowd and knowing that the waiting at popular times can be long I used their on-line \"get on the wait list\" feature because we had about a 15 minute drive to the restaurant.  I received a confirmation and a notice that the wait time was five minutes.  When we got to the restaurant they did not have our names on their list and the waiting time was 45 minutes, not five.  The check-in person was accommodating in advancing our place in line, but somehow her accommodation still did not get our name on the list.  It took a second conversation to get our name on any list at all, and I suppose our wait was less than the 45 minutes it would have been if we had just walked in.  But their \"get on the wait list\" on-line feature simply didn't work.

I ordered à la carte and my wife ordered Mama's Pancake breakfast.  The food was good enough, although the sausage patties were thin and tough.  Not what you would expect a country style breakfast to have.  I also had what they call a hash-brown casserole, which was actually the best part of my meal.  Perhaps other dishes are better.  But the food we had, while good enough, wasn't good enough to justify the wait and the price.

The upside was that the staff was pleasant and most helpful.  They did seem a bit overwhelmed by the large crowd but managed to maintain good customer relations in spite of it.  

Perhaps after this restaurant is open for a while longer they will get the wrinkles ironed out."}
{"text":"This is our third time in this specific location, we've found the  food consistent and always a pleasant experience (we've been to a lot of Cracker Barrels in our travels) Today has been the best because of Nic, our server. The food was excellent, and the service was stellar!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are so friendly and the food is so good. Must try the biscuits. Today my server was Brooke R. She was fast and always had my drink refilled. Great job!!"}
{"text":"Slow service, rude waiters and waitresses, takes over an hour or two to even order. You get ignored by everyone. Came here 3 times and every time is worse than the last. Go to mcdonalds and get better service."}
{"text":"Great service, food pretty much the same as other CB's but the service from the greeter to the cashier was spot on. I'll be back. One thing though.... why are the mashed potatoes never really hot?"}
{"text":"Skip this location. Ordered take out and of course not ready when I arrived. Not a busy night but I was really craving dumplings so I thought I would let the timing issue slide. Had to ask the hostess twice to check to see if my order was ready. She was more interested in talking with a friend that was there. Finally food arrives. I drive home and guess what......wrong order entirely. I called the store for a refund and they require you to come back to the store. I live 10 min away so that's not going to happen. Rude manager offered nothing but his apologizes.
I won't return to this location. The meatloaf was dry. I bet my dumplings would have been better."}
{"text":"Please note: This restaurant has NO affiliation to the cheese. 

This place is country cute and the food is pure comfort food. In fact, I decided to try the oooey-gooey most fattening food on the menu. 

The dumplings were good.
The mac and cheese was okay.
The fried shrimp very heavy...I didn't care for the batter. Good on chicken bad on shrimp.
The best thing on the place was the hashbrown casserole which was just okay.

The customer service was great which is why I gave the place three stars. I doubt I will be back here again once in a lifetime was enough.

I will say this about the artery-clogging heart attack on a plate restaurant. You don't go away hungry!"}
{"text":"I had just arrived at my friends place in Arizona and was hungry after the 5 1/2 hour drive.   My friend suggesting a few places to eat, but there are few options in Buckeye, AZ and Cracker Barrel is the only one that sounded good.   I'd heard of Cracker Barrel but never been, so this was my chance.

SERVICE:  Our server Deana was pretty awesome.  Very friendly, always with had smile and not far away if we needed anything, including a beverage refills we never had to ask for.   The food came out of the kitchen in a timely manner as well.

FOOD:  After looking over the large menu of southern comfort fixin's, I decided on the Fried Chicken Salad ($8.69), a side of Mac & cheese ($2.59) and a side of the \"Hash brown casserole\" ($2.59).   My friend ordered the chicken tender sandwich platter ($8.49).

My salad was good as salads go.   Crisp lettuce, crispy chicken tender pieces, grape tomatoes, cheese & croutons.   Simple, but tasty overall and really hit the spot!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#z6-H47IpF9u2nPk3QuEhIQ

Mac & cheese = ooey, gooey, creamy & cheesy.... Pretty tasty and more flavor than just melted Velveeta.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#DFuHeGdidUkXxC5-qBA9Mg

I had to try the Hash brown casserole because \"it was there\".  Very cheesy and oniony, it's quite rich, but quite tasty!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cracker-barrel-buckeye#tba2M2j_hNS77K2TVaflCw

My friend said his open faced chicken sandwich (w/fried rather than grilled chicken) was very good, though he didn't eat any of the corn bread and apple butter that came with it.

OVERALL:  Nice place and friendly service, for when you want those down home country vittles in a VERY down home country environment.... 3.5 stars rounded up!"}
{"text":"There is a problem when a business is so popular or so busy that they don't care about customer service.  

This is our first time here and I definitely do not feel welcome.  For starters the hostess never smiled once. The guy bringing us to the table never smiled.  Our server, Natalie, tried to smile but you could tell it was forced.  

As we placed our order our server asked if we wanted \"baked potato salad or 3 sides\".  We hesitated because we didn't know what a baked potato salad was.  She repeated herself as of we didn't speak English.  (We understood her loud and clear, it just didn't make sense.)  So, we asked for the potato salad.  To which she asked what type of dressing.  We were confused so I asked why there was dressing on potato salad.  She reiterated by enunciating each word slowly, \"...I said baked potato or salad...\", which she did not. 

Even after I explained that it was our first time she continued to explain what she said.  And never acknowledged us for it.  

Towards the end, and probably because I already started writing this review, she became nicer.  

Food-wise, I thought it was good.  But somehow when you get frustrated and irritated right after sitting down your appetite is ruined. 

I MIGHT give them a second chance."}
{"text":"My family and I will not eat at any Cracker Barrell again. We went to the one on Craig Road tonight. There was no sign on the door that stated no guns.  Nevada is an open carry state and my son and I we're both armed.  We entered and ordered. Just before the meals arrived, the manager came to our table and asked that my son and I disarm.  If there had been a sign on the door, we would have chosen somewhere else to eat. As it was, we cancelled our order and went to one of our favorite restaurants anyway."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Was treated to rudely in front of my child and husband. Will never go here again. I recommend finding a different restaurant."}
{"text":"BREAKFAST: If you ask for my opinion, I would not have breakfast here. Their food is low quality and over priced for breakfast. You could literally go to a local breakfast cafe for better food, larger portions, for a better price. 

LUNCH/DINNER: Their lunch and dinner is way better quality than their breakfast. The dishes are all-american favorites. Everything comes in a large portion and their sides are really great with the entrees. Their food tastes like cafeteria styled food so I wouldn't recommend this place if you looking for fresh made to order dishes. My two personal favorites are the fried chicken dinner served on Sundays and their catfish served everyday. I like to add mac n' cheese and mashed potatoes to my orders. They also serve corn bread and/or biscuits with most orders. In addition, you can add soup or salad to your meal for a few dollars.

DRINKS: Their Strawberry Lemonade is super refreshing! Personally, I like to get the bottled sodas:)

SERVICE: I guess in their defense, they are always really busy with a minimum 30 minute wait for a table....but that shouldn't be an excuse. The hosts never seem to call people in the order they come in. People get really angry and frustrated when they wait over an hour for a table and someone who came in five minutes ago slips them a tip and get in immediately. When your table is ready, the hosts take forever before they actually walk you to your table making you wait another 5 to 10 minutes for them to \"clean your table.\" Once you sit down, the tables and chairs are dirty and you have to ask someone to clean it for you. It takes forever for waiters to come get your orders and it seems like the waiters don't have stations they work at. They seem to serve all the tables which makes everything unorganized. Every time I've been here, I have to deal with them serving me broken mugs and dirty water glasses. The waiters are all super unfriendly and lazy when you ask for anything too. I have been here a few times because I want to try all their food, but it's discouraging for the customers to come here when they have horrible service every single time they come in!

STORE: Their store is the cutest thing ever with very unique snacks and novelties. I love their variety of bottled sodas in the display area, their old fashion candies, and all the cute stuffed animals!"}
{"text":"First off- as an 11-year Madison resident, I ate at Cracker Barrel for the very first time (here) last weekend.  We met friends from out of town, and overall it was pretty good.  The staff had no problem pulling together two tables for the 7 of us, and service was both prompt and correct.  CB serves breakfast all day, and what a breakfast it is!  Portions were fair, not huge, and the price was right.  Bacon, eggs, biscuits and grits- yum.  My only gripe was that the sausage gravy was gelatinous and plopped out of the bowl instead of pouring.  That was kind of gross.

CB clearly caters to insterstate travelers, and it does this well.  You can also find some interesting items in their huge \"country store\", from cutesy mugs and figurines to sweatshirts for Gramps and Easter dresses for the young'uns."}
{"text":"everything was good until i found a long hair in my hashbrown casserole. our waitress was always in a hurry and was real snippy. i ordered a water and a sprite the waitress then refillled both cups with water then ran off."}
{"text":"Hair in my toddlers pancakes! Burnt scrambled eggs for me. Service was okay. Got our bill wig our food."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before, so this must have an impact on me. This was the first time I have been to cracker barrel for breakfast and my second visit in total. People always say they give the most filling meal and best tasting foods, well not true.

I was surprised how bland tasting the food was and how little I was served. I ordered the egg whites, sourdough French toast meal, Beacon , and their hash browns that was a special style of the al la carte menu. 

First off, they would not substitute my Beacon for any thing else on the menu like fruit or toast, I Dont eat meat. Next the sourdough French toast was bland with no flavor, the hash browns were good, but the only gave a two spoon scoopings. My coffee had floaters in it, and my egg whites were only enough for three bites. My plate had plenty of room.

I left hungry, and sad. I don't eat a lot , and I'm not a big guy, but I was still hungry. I don't think I'll ever go back, but maybe I should try their lunch next time. Never for breakfast again."}
{"text":"First Timers and most likely Last Timers.
It was just probably not a good night at The Cracker Barrel I'm guessing. We had a nice waitress but it took 30 minutes to get water & teas (NOT till after we got served salad) and had to ask for our drinks the 2nd time! Even a nearby table received their drinks quicker and they JUST sat down! Next were the Entrees, my Mom ordered the Pot Pie which was the lunch Special so it was (guessing) sitting for 4 hours. It smelt like dog food and my Mom completely lost her appetite and just couldn't think of eating. I ordered the (small plate) of chicken & dumplings with corn & mashed potatoes, it was okay it just hit my stomach like a Brick. Dad had the Meatloaf & mashed potatoes( it was a \"6\" from a 1-10) FYI it's very THICK. The biscuits were the Best thing there!"}
{"text":"We went to Cracker Barrel on a Saturday morning so a wait was to be expected.  We hung out with the family outside and played Checkers in rocking chairs until our name was called. We had 3 adults and 3 kids in our party.  

The waiter was ok. Our food came out in a timely manner and we didn't have to send any of the food back. I decided to try something new instead of my usual omelette. I ordered a 
Maple Pepper Bacon Breakfast Sandwich minus the tomatoe and lettuce and ordered my son a ham and cheese omelette. My sandwich was delicious. The combo of meats with the egg n cheese was mouth watering. My sons omnlette was really good as well. My mother ordered chicken, rice and green beans and love it. The manager told her to try it with Lima beans next time.

Overall, great food, great service, wonder environment and food. I always love going to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I am one of Cracker Barrel's biggest supporters. I visit at least 3 times a month. However, this means an extra hour of cardio on Monday. The pecan pancakes are absolutely divine. I've only eaten dinner there twice and it was pretty good and would have dinner there again. But if it's breakfast food you are in the mood for this is the place to go! The service has been consistently good. Ask for Mommas Pancake special. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Only can say for breakfast but food was sub-par, semi warm, and bland. Tasted worse than canned gravy on the biscuits and flavorless saussage. Eggs are eggs (had scrambled)imo and hashbrowns were ok. Overall seemed like nothing made in house all pre-made to order"}
{"text":"We finally made our way to Cracker Barrel which up until now we mainly went to on our way home from the beach.  I have a hard time straying from breakfast and so I don't have much experience with anything but that.  When we arrived a lady in the parking lot told us the it was really cold inside but it was mainly in the general store area. I was glad to hear that it was confined to that area because I didn't want to be cold.  We were greeted promptly by our waitress who was nice enough but not as friendly and energetic as I would have liked or that I'm used to and I was surprised that I got friendlier service in an east coast CB than one in the friendly south.  I normally order Uncle Herschel's Breakfast but this time I got Grandpa's Big Breakfast which consisted of Biscuits and sawmill gravy, chicken fried steak, grits, two eggs and cheesy hash brown casserole.  Hubby got pancakes, eggs, sausage and bacon.

The wait was a tad long for the fast service we normally get.  We had to ask for the complimentary biscuits, which I hate that most places don't just bring it to you like they did in the \"good ole\" days.  I'm guessing this a money saving tactic but when I asked, the waitress was like, \"Your meal comes with a biscuit.  You still want complimentary bread?'  Really?  Who doesn't want complimentary biscuits and corn muffins while they wait?  I told her yes, that I love the biscuits and I was \"starving\" and my heart was saying, yes, please and thank you.  Very nice waitress but are you really trying to talk me out of the 'free' stuff?
The food finally came out and everything was good, a bit lukewarm so I assume it may have been sitting for a bit.  I tasted my husbands pancakes and they were really good and we gobbled almost everything up!  All I had left was one biscuit and a bit of gravy.  Being a person that doesn't waste anything and hates to throw food in the trash, I asked another waitress walking by for a small box.  My waitress returned with a larger box and since it was quite large for my one biscuit, she brought out a couple more to add to the larger container.  REDEMPTION!  Oh, I forgot to mention that the corn muffins came out burnt and dry and so those were not consumed but the biscuits were obviously fresh out of the oven, fluffy, moist and just plain yummy!  

Will I go back?  Of course!   It's Cracker Barrel where you can get an insanely delicious, filling breakfast for a steal.  Question is, will I be brave enough to stray from breakfast and explore the menu beyond Uncle Herschel's and Grandpa's breakfast?  I don't know, but if I do, I'll let you know.

That is all."}
{"text":"This is great for breakfast .Giant checkers and rocking chair greeting on entrance..great service and love the bisque test"}
{"text":"I go to cracker barrel frequently last night was terrible the cat fish was cold no hush puppies with platter asked for plainsweet potatoe it came with cinnamon and butter, the waitress could have cared less I 
 will return to Red Lobster they care."}
{"text":"LOVE their breakfast! 100% delish. I usually try to eat healthy, but when I just crave a seriously tasty breakfast, this is the place to go. The pancakes are amazing, especially when accompanied by the pure maple syrup they serve warm in a brand-new glass that is \"yours\" (thumbs up for not having to use a massivly sticky, gross syrup canister sitting at the table!). The oatmeal is also very good, especially if you get it with a tasty blueberry muffin & add some delish maple syrup into the oatmeal.

Service is usually friendly but sometimes I'll get a server that isn't very helpful and has a hard time swapping out what is included in the meals so that's too bad. I also wish they served their oatmeal all day instead of just during \"breakfast\" time, considering all of their other breakfast items are available all day.

Also note that it does get very busy on weekend mornings, so plan ahead that you might have to wait awhile (no stars are deducted for this, obviously).

Prices are also great. You get a TON for what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Service was painfully inadequate.  Waitress served everything at once (bread, salads, entrees), forgot the kids beverages, and forgot my side dishes.  I tried the Saturday special: chicken and rice, which was colorless and slopped on a plate, reminding me of prison food!  Since the waitress forgot the sides, it was a sad presentation, and served lukewarm.  No fresh fruit was available.  I always love the Cracker Barrel gift shop, hence the one star ..."}
{"text":"I went down to Cracker Barrel for dinner over the weekend. The service out there was pretty good. Didnt have to wait for long. It is near the East Towne Mall. The food was decent too. There werent a lot of people so the place was generally quiet. For dessert I had the baked apple dumplin. I have to admit that is the very best I have ever eaten. If I do go back to a Cracker Barrel it will be for the dessert."}
{"text":"Booo.  Pork chop and chicken breast overcooked, tasted freezer burnt. Was informed that it comes in frozen and already cooked and they just heat it up?  Chicken was also underseasoned by a lot.
Cucumbers in salad soggy and translucent.  Apparently kitchen can't identify when produce is on the fritz, which is a concern for me.  Also bad spots on my steamed broccoli.
Portion size was weak!  Thought prices were good until I saw amount of food.
Subpar service.  Manager did comp pork chop, an appropriate response.
Take yourself to Black Bear Diner, where portions are big, same price.  Similar all American type dining experience and good food."}
{"text":"Went after a high school graduation this past week. Got there about 7:30 and didn't leave until 9:30. Their night crew was extremely under staffed. 1 young lady was in charge of 3 large tables and causing our drink order to take over 15 minutes. I don't blame the young waitress; she apologized over and over again and tried her absolute hardest. It's time for Cracker Barrel to step it up and gets some more staff for the night. Food was good though as always and price is quite cheap. Will go back for sure just maybe not at night...."}
{"text":"Okay, this is NOT the place to visit if you're trying to eat healthy. The food was good, portions generous, and the customer service was AMAZING! Their menu had lots of food items to choose from. No five stars because they don't serve alcohol (could've really used a glass of wine; hell, a beer...LOL). Their country store literally has everything and lots of nostalgic candy & sodas. Enjoyed the store more than the restaurant."}
{"text":"***store***
I was looking for a little gift for my husband. I asked Quinn if the store had any husband gifts. She looked but couldn't find anything so I decided to create my own soda collection. Quinn could have left me there or in the beginning she could have just said \"no we don't\" and moved on. But instead she stayed curious and eager to help me. She was an expert regarding the history and taste of the different soda collections. She offered her personal testimony of almost all of the sodas. When I described what my husband loves and hates she was able to give me specific options and created an effortless shopping experience. Thank you Quinn for being patient and for being very pleasant during my first visit at your location. 
***Cashier***
Holland was very nice and efficient. She was able to complete the experience by giving me the information i needed to complete the customer satisfaction survey. I decide to yelp my experience so everyone can get a glimpse of what they can expect when they visit this location.
****Food***
BOMB!!! I ordered the chicken BLT, grilled as suggested by our waitress. The biscuits are great and the cornbread is ok. I'll be back to try the breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"The staff was great but the food was nothing special. The plates do not look appetizing. I had asked to order an omelet (cheese and ham) and they charged me $9.68. The plate look unappetizing and it tasted bland. The egg was thin,  I only had 5 small pieces of ham, one block of cheese in my omelet. The server was nice but agreed that the omelet was not a good choice. At least I had the biscuits. I guess? 
Side note: As for checking in with the host/hostess they really should have that specifically booth on the other side of the restaurant with a delegate entrance. Having the check out for your meal/gift shop plus host checking is ridiculous when you have elderly, kids and individuals needing to wheel/crutch exit the restaurant in the same area. Too much traffic!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple if times an I think I leave less impressed every time.  The food tastes canned, frozen, or from a mix. The service is lackluster at best.  

Today our food was cold and dry... How does that even happen when the food took less than 10 min to get to the table... To me that makes it seem like it was all precooked and reheated to order.

I suppose I am not their target clientele, regardless I still have left every time I've gone feeling like I wasted both calories and money."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has very good food, but the serving portions are a bit small. 
Also, the wait time is around 30 minutes and that was for a party of two. 
Overall, the food is good so I would go back"}
{"text":"I love this place!  We visited Arizona, and ate here three times!  Just good, old-fashioned food.  I love the chicken-fried chicken!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great food, service is spot on and no matter how busy they are you always feel welcome."}
{"text":"This used to be a decent place about 10 years ago, but lately Cracker Barrel uses too much frozen food. If I wanted stale nasty old frozen food I would go to the grocery store and make it myself and not pay a ridiculous price for it. I travel extensively and because Cracker Barrels are close to Hampton Hotels typically, I have eaten there quite a bit and I could say there is nothing on their menu that is any good at all. I just had the meatloaf, mashed potatoes and gravy, coleslaw, deep fried okra and Coca-Cola cake. The mashed potatoes were cold and lumpy, the worst meatloaf I've ever eaten, the deep fried okra definitely Frozen from a grocery store bag and the Coca-Cola cake was so stale an old I cracked my plastic fork on it when trying to take a bite. Miserable disappointment plus the service has been really lousy lately both in Kansas and Illinois locations. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place!  They always have the best country food and the service is always good."}
{"text":"I enjoy homestyle food, but this was a little disappointing.  I will go back and try them again sometime.

They brought me an Iced Tea that was cloudy and tasted off.  That usually means they didn't dump out the tea from the night before, or they didn't do a good job washing out the tea container.  Yuck.

I had today's special, Baked Chicken with Dressing.  The chicken was pretty good, and the vegetable side that came with it was also good (carrots).  But I did not like the dressing.

The server was very nice and friendly, but I think they are still a little overwhelmed.  It is still very busy, and maybe they need more staff?  It took quite a while to get the beverages, and then it took a while to get the check afterwards.

Never make people wait to PAY!

Wait time to be seated was only 5 minutes today!"}
{"text":"I am in heaven while I am here:

1. Great service and very friendly staff
2. Everything on the menu is amazing- the chicken fried steak is my favorite.
The biscuits and gravy is so good that I have actually called in an order to go and picked it up a few minutes later to enjoy on a busy day.

3. Everything in the gift shop is cool to look at while you wait for a table.
4. Sometimes the wait on the weekends is a little long bit but worth it

I do not like that many of their items they will not do substitutions. That is my only complaint as I am sometimes picky about my food combinations."}
{"text":"If you're looking for consistency in your breakfast experience, this is the place! I have always had a good experience at this location, and the meals have been prepared well.

I'm writing this review because more recently my coworker had me as a Secret Santa this year and noted that they have an exceptional peacock themed section to the gift shop. Peacocks are my jam! She spoiled me with all kinds of fun things this Christmas, all were from Cracker Barrel's gift shop, and I was pleasantly surprised at this! :)"}
{"text":"Finally a restaurant I have tried in Glendale (see Bitzee Mama's and Kimberly Ann reviews for more info) that wasn't too bad.  Granted it's a chain...but one that provides decent artery-clogging, old-style American cuisine.

We got in and out fairly quickly on a Friday night around 5:30ish.  That was important to us because we were heading to the Cards preseason game.  We also picked Cracker Barrel because it is on the north side of Glendale Ave and it would be easier and quicker to navigate back to the Brown parking lot on 91st.  Hubbie didn't want to try and hit anything in the Westgate because of possibly getting snarled in traffic as we tried to get to our parking lot.

Both hubbie and I got the fish fry.  It was better than the fish I had at Zipp's.  The daughter and I really like the Cracker Barrel coleslaw.  The son liked his chicken fried chicken.

Most of the games will be on a Sunday, so I am not sure if we will repeat our visit to Cracker Barrel.  I am assuming that Sunday's are probably busy days for them.  But if the parking lot looks reasonable, we will probably eat there at least one other time for a home game."}
{"text":"It was my 1st time there who some friends recommend we go.
It was  a Sunday morning and the wait line we were giving was 20 mins so we decided to wait. Well we waited more than 20 mins more like 1 hr. I was very hungry and moody at this point and almost left.

 I'm so glad I didn't leave because the breakfast was Delicious!!  I got the traditional American breakfast that included pancakes, eggs, sausage etc.....  what I like the best was the fresh orange juice. I would definitely recommend this place. I live in SAN DIEGO so I'm a little disappointed we don't have one here. Cracker Barrel beats DENNYS any-day in my list. I"}
{"text":"Very busy place on a Sunday! Servers are excellent in taking your orders though. It's an American brunch/dinner place with a grocery store before going in the restaurant. They sell what they serve so if you can't get enough of their jams and stuff, make sure to grab them on your way out."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with friend and had their meatloaf. First they served my dinner salad with the meal. Not a good start. Then the meatloaf...absolutely the worst meatloaf I have ever had. It had a strange sour taste and the consistency was mushy. My friend had the fried chicken which was pretty good. The manager came over and I told him about the meatloaf and he offered the exchange it...service was good although serve asked repeatedly if things were ok to the point of being annoying. Dinner at CB is so-so. Breakfast is better."}
{"text":"Oh Crack Bar, my faithful old friend.

You smell like fireplace smoke and fundamental Christianity, but my goodness I love your food and your cheesy \"cuntry\" giftshop.

This one is no different than any other Cracker Barrel you've been in - clean floors, good food, service with a smile, and sweet tea so sweet it could give the Tooth Fairy a cavity. 

The price is right, the portion sizes are good, and the wait at this CB was surprisingly not as long as it is at many others.

Visit this Cracker Barrel - you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Absolutely my all time favorite place to go. The atmophere is super old school, you are right next to carowinds so you can eat here instead of the overpriced food there, and the food is amazing. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner the food is always amazing and is a high recommendation."}
{"text":"The kids have been begging for Cracker Barrel pancakes so I took one for the team and we went back for the first time since my other review. 

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. We were seated right away and our waitress actually knew a little about her job. They actually had the items we ordered (wow!!) and the food came out in a completely reasonable amount of time. One huge bonus is that it looks like the actually dusted the picture frames and knick knacks. No spook house worthy cobwebs. 



There were minor glitches. The waitress delivered no plates or jelly with the biscuits, she deserted us a bit after the food came out but another waitress who was awesome came to our rescue. The cashier when we paid was a huge grouch. Huge. But that interaction was brief, so no biggie. 

Maybe they have a new management team. This location seems to be inching towards decent."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try Cracker Barrel since it opened here in Las.
Well, the ambiance is fantastic!
The fireplace was glowing and keeping everyone within 15ft. warm and cozy on this Friday morning in December.
They have a checkers table nearest to the fireplace too.
So I asked our hostess and server, what is the most popular item on the breakfast menu.
Gramma's sampler platter - actually not on the menu -was the response.
It's an order of pancakes, bacon or sausage, eggs and choice of potatoes. We chose the hash brown casserole.
When I think of hash browns for breakfast, I'm thinking ...
crispy.
Key word here is CASSEROLE. 
NO crispness at all. 
Soupy ... Soggy shredded potatoes. PASS!
Bacon ordered crispy as usual, bacon I got was soggy and chewy. PASS!
Eggs came as ordered, over easy. BUENO!
Pancakes, I love me some good crispy on the edges pancake that's yeasty and melts in your mouth.
Looked great, butter was frozen and of course, hard to spread.
Pancakes was a little burnt. (see pic)
I didn't bring this to the attention of the staff as we needed to make an appt.
No biggie, flavor was ok and the maple syrup helped.
Coffee was just ok to me but remember, I'm a self appointed coffee snob. (I'm getting better tho)
Perhaps if there is a next time, we'll definitely order something different.
We'll be back in Las Vegas February 2018.
Have a safe holiday season folks!"}
{"text":"Can we pleeeease have a Cracker Barrel in CA? Pretty please!! Heard about this place through numerous friends and finally got to try it during a trip to AZ and the hype did not disappoint. 

I got breakfast with pancakes, grits, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, hash browns (yes this is all in one dish) wow! Everything was delicious! they make their own maple syrup! Also ask to try their apple butter, yum! 

I was also side-eyeing a dish for the girl next to me. She got chicken strips with mashed potatoes and some corn I think and it looked damn good! 

I was determined to try their dessert but I was maxed out! Will definitely go back whenever I happen to be near one!"}
{"text":"This is a really cool restaurant and craft store.  The amount of neat things they have for sale will have you shopping before and after your amazing meal."}
{"text":"Clean, consistent, nice decor, & friendly service. Was there just a few days ago for late breakfast   Not busy, wasn't hurried to give up table and food was as tasty as I remember"}
{"text":"I went with my family around 7:30 on a Saturday night. We had a short wait time of about 15 minutes. We placed our orders for four dinners. We waited. During our wait we played a little game they had at the table. This kept us occupied while the wait grew longer. Our waitress (Rebecca had a single star on her name tag) was very attentive to refilling our teas and apologetic for the wait. She brought us a plate of biscuits to nibble on while we waited. She was very attentive. I was very impressed with her. She did an excellent job doing all she could while the kitchen was backed up. Needless to say it took over an hour to receive our meals. However, because of the waitress giving such excellent service and the food was amazing, we will return. I don't know what the star rating on the name tags was for but I feel Rebecca deserves five stars.The manager did take care of our check. Overall if it had not been for the wait this review would be five star. I even spent money in their gift store. The gift store is fantastic. The best I have seen. I have been to this restaurant before and never had any issues. I was thoroughly impressed for the way we were treated and for the managers no hesitation to go above and beyond in discounting our food."}
{"text":"After not having been to a Cracker Barrel in quite a while, I found returning to the restaurant to be quite charming. The decor and atmosphere are so warm. 

We were very quickly seated. The service was also quick, but I felt a little rushed. Our waiter asked too often, if we were ready to order, and we got the bill after barely a few bites. 

The food was okay, not great. I had the chicken blt. I could have made the same at home, maybe better. 

The prices are fine, and I could understand why a family would come here. 

It was an okay experience but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at any restaurant. Server couldn't care less. Took over 10 minutes for a server to come to the table. Didn't check on us after taking our order. No offer to refill drinks (that the manager had to bring to us in the first place because the server disappeared). 25 minutes after we ordered, we got up and left...food still hadn't been delivered to the table. The manager offered a coupon for next time, but turned it down...will not go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for years but glad I came back the breakfast was very good and a nice portion.  Service was fantastic and super friendly.  The best part is the gift shop has some really clever stuff in there. I will definitely go back for sure.  Also its definitely a great place to take the family."}
{"text":"When you wait over a half hour to be seated, order damn near everything on the menu, have a hair in your food, and the only thing you finish is a salad (rare for me).... safe to say, don't waste your time  coming here lol.... biscuits were great though !"}
{"text":"Took an hour wait for breakfast, for food so average, I would have rather gone to the mcdonalds across the street. Atleast my experience and wait would have been better. The menus are hard to understand and the noise levels mixed with the crowded atmosphere is very unpleasant. It was not a clean atmosphere.  There waa dust and liquids on the tables and on the wallw next to them. The waitress, though cheerful, was not helpful navigating the menu and choosing a dish. I was not impressed with such a supposed classic, home style, restaurant, if you can even call it that. There were good prices however."}
{"text":"Unhappy...between the wait to get seated and to get the food I am pissed! We were told the wait was 45 minutes and ended up waiting for over an hour. THEN when we were finally seated the wait to get the food was almost 45 minutes and the food was luke warm! My eggs were wrong so I had to send my food back which made me madder because I had already waited ALMOST 2 HOURS!  The cornbread that was brought to the table was ROCK HARD.  I cant believe they would send that out for someone to eat!

When a manager finally came over he was in training, didnt offer to comp ANYTHING or give a token for the inconvenience. I felt like he was sent over to pacify me.

I ended up speaking to the manager Christine of the restaurant who was apologetic and did compensate for the issues but I know for a FACT I won't be back on a weekend.

No pictures because the table has since been cleared. I started off giving one star but bumped it up to 3 because of Christine.

BTW the food was flavourful."}
{"text":"I spent a weekend in Phoenix and I had to stop at a Cracker Barrel in the area at least once so I came here for dinner on the 18th of September. This time I ordered chicken tenderloins (deep fried). I had the choice of three sides so I picked cheesy grits, pinto beans and the vegetable of the day which happened to be cabbage. I was asked if I wanted biscuits or corn bread and I asked for two biscuits. When it came to choose a beverage, I chose an old-fashioned lemonade. The restaurant was moderately busy but the food took only about 10 minutes to arrive. My tenderloins consisted of 6 chicken strips. They were good but I felt they were more indicated for a kid that does not yet appreciates good country style cooking because they were good but they did not have the complexity of flavor of many dishes I tried at Cracker Barrel before. The grits were good: they were light and coarse. There was cheese on them but I could not really taste it. The pinto beans were fairly standard. The cabbage was definitely the highlight of the night. Apparently, it is only available on Sundays. It was boiled in water with ham and it was spiced with black pepper so it was salty and complex in flavor. It was truly a good side. I liked it very much and it filled me up fairly quickly. The biscuits were also standard but somewhat dry. The lemonade was great and extremely refreshing, truly perfect for the Arizona temperatures. Our waiter was nice and she came to check on us many times. All in all it was a good dinner and I will come again but I will try something different from the chicken tenderloins."}
{"text":"We came here after going to see Santa at bass pro. I have been here once before and loved the atmosphere which is why we tried it again. We were sat down and waited for 10 minutes for a waiter/ waitress to come over and acknowledge us, my husband timed it. I kept seeing servers come by our table and give other people service but never once did they come to our table. I made eye contact with more than one server to see if they \"forgot\" about us but to no avail... We went across the street to Logan's roadhouse and were immediately served and had great food."}

{"text":"It was my first visit to the Cracker Barrel. I decided on the lunch platter of fillet catfish which included two sides. I chose the mac and cheese and corn kernels. The catfish was light and tasty. The portions weren't huge but lunch platters are only $8. I did pick at my friends leftovers and the hashbrown casserole, biscuits and fried apples were incredible. There was a 30 minute wait on a Wednesday morning and yet our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely come back but would order something different."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is all good, food, service, gift store but.... those chairs, they are so small and uncomfortable.  That is the only reason I don't go there often."}
{"text":"Gonna have to give a big 'ol 'MEH' to Cracker Barrel! My fiancé was super stoked that we were finally getting one, as they're all over the place where she's from (Ohio).... We waited for 45 minutes to be seated, and then another 45 for our food :-/  Every waitress looked frazzled by the crowds. The food? I had the chicken fried steak, and it looked (and tasted) like a frozen bagged patty. Gravy tasted like bland instant gravy, and the green beans definitely came from a can.... Overall, I'd say save your money. Seems like people only like Cracker Barrel because of nostalgic childhood memories :-)"}
{"text":"The AC is cranked up WAY too high.  It's freezing in this place year round.  Some of the food items are very good, the rest are ok.  Service is average."}
{"text":"Why are dogs allowed in the restaurant? I asked to be seated in a different section this morning for breakfast because I didn't want to eat in the same area as a couple and their DOG! She had him right in her lap with his head on the table. I have dogs but they stay at home if we are going out to eat."}
{"text":"I've already posted a picture of what my dinner portion of chicken and dumplings was please feel free take a look at that they were tasteless there was one small piece of chicken which had absolutely no taste dryer is dry can be considering that is sitting in entire bed of gravy the gravy alone had no taste I ordered a pink lemonade that had a frosted glass but the eliminated self was warm how is that even possible this is one of the worst meals I have ever had and it said they actually want charge you 799 for this meal everyone is raving about how wonderful and how excited  they were for Cracker Barrel I'm sorry I just don't see it now will never be coming back this is beyond bad I wish I could give less than one star"}
{"text":"First let me say I have had nothing but good experiences at all the Cracker Barrel's I have visited in several states... Until I visited the one at 21611 26th Ave Phoenix AZ. 
Wasn't that busy nearly empty and still there was a 20 minute wait. Waiter was smiling but it looked forced. Food took a little longer than normal to get to the table and when it did come... All of us were very disappointed with all the different types of food that was ordered. Mostly cold and flavorless. 
Very disappointed and it put a bad taste in my mouth and we all know when that happens it's hard to go back to a restraunt for another try.
I give two starts based on knowing I have had good experiences at other locations that would get a 4 or 5 star rating from me."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd visit to this location. It is fast becoming a favorite.
We had the same server both times just by coincidence, Myranda.
She is awesome and sweet.
The servers here work really hard, they are always busy here. We were lucky enough to get the table in front of the fireplace,which was on. It made my night because, it was cold and rainy outside and we were cozy warm by the fire. Happiness!!

Anyway, the food was so good, and so much we had to take some home.
I had the Thursday night meal, Turkey with dressing.
The Turkey is real, not the processed and pressed kind. I ordered for my sides mashed potatoes and cooked apples. Myranda even brought me extra gravy on the side which was so good.
We always like to take a little something home for the dog. So I poured the left over gravy on what I was taking home for her. It had celery and real chunks of turkey in it.
She as well loved it!!
The cooked apples were like dessert. Sweet but, not overly. 
Mario got the beef stew dinner. He said it was awesome but, he wished it was more. Because, he liked it so much.
Cornbread muffins on the side! Delish!!
 To think I never would of known about this place unless a friend wanted to meet here for breakfast about a month ago.
I do totally love the little shop in the front as well. It is really cute!"}
{"text":"I got here at 4pm today where there wasn't that many people there, which was awesome considering I had a cranky toddler that kept throwing his bottle and crayons.  

The food was awesome and my son had the mac and cheese. It wasn't the regular Kraft mac and cheese which I appreciated (if I wanted him to eat that I would have got the box for $1 at the store and made it myself).  

Service was great, the only dislike was the okra.. a bit too breaded and was more of a crouton than a breaded vegetable. 

Will be back again :)"}
{"text":"NONE! of the food was fresh!
Biscuits, yesterdays...
Gravy, lumpy and watery...
Smoked ham tasted old, replaced w/same...
Basted eggs were over cooked...
Butter was in thimble sized tub...
The water was filtered and was the
best I ever got in a restaurant...
Never again!!"}
{"text":"Our typical Cracker Barrel experience, service was good but waited over 25 minutes for food to come. When it did come it was cold, no syrup, waited again for follow up visit. I can understand if it the restaurant was busy..."}
{"text":"Food was horrible in our opinion. Every item was very, very heavily salted. My wife loves \"greens\" however, she took a taste and left the rest as the salt content was ridiculous. My \"roasted turkey\" smelled bad ( like old leftover turkey), was dry, tasted like it smelled and I did not eat it.
The sides of carrots were mushy and extremely sweet from excess sugar added (perhaps the Southern way?)The broccoli was the only item which was not salted too heavily ( maybe they missed it?).
My wife's pork chops looked nothing like the appetizing pictures of pork chops Cracker Barrel shows. The were perhaps one fourth inch thick or so and cooked up very dry and tasteless. 
Biscuits were not special either, warm when served and rock hard five minutes later.
This was our first visit. Likely our last. My comments to Cracker Barrel were acknowledged as received."}
{"text":"I called in a to go order.  I love that my entire order was repeated back to me and I got exactly what I ordered when I picked it up."}
{"text":"The Cracker Barrel never misses a beat. I was in the area and for lunch I chose the homemade chicken n' dumplins with country green beans and sweet whore baby carrots. I'm not a huge fan of dumplins but I figured I'd try them again, it's been years, and I liked them. The food at Cracker Barrel is always amazing. I walked out stuffed and satisfied. This place deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"In the Las Vegas area there are currently two Cracker Barrel locations. One is on the southwest of the city and the other is on the north and this is the one on the north side (which opened only 2 months ago). I stopped for lunch on the 1st of January. It was around noon and the place was insanely packed. It was also loud. I have been at many Cracker Barrel locations across the nation and I have never seen so much people in line to eat. I put my name in the list and 45 minutes later I heard my name being called. At that point I was taken to a table and I was assisted by Jason. I ordered a frozen apple cider mug and farm-raised catfish platter with three sides: turnip greens, vegetable of the day (cabbage) and fried apples. I also got a biscuit and a corn bread. The frozen apple cider mug was out of this world. I have been at this restaurant many times and I never tried it. I feel so guilty with myself. I will spend the rest of the year accusing myself. I was surprised how good the mug was. Basically, it was a dense apple juice, something like a liquid version of an apple sauce. It was juicy and sweet. I will definitely order it again. The fried catfish consisted of two pieces of breaded catfish which I found very tasty. The turnip greens are something I never tried before. It was similar to spinach but raw in texture. The cabbage was good. I had it before but it was cooked differently. This time it was served as moderately wet leaves. The fried apples were great, sweet and flavorful. It's unfortunate that I looked a jar of that and I found out it contains high-fructose corn syrup (very disappointing indeed). Jason was great at the table. He was friendly, helpful and polite. I enjoyed talking to him. After a while we lost him a little (he seemed busy or not around so much). It was another great meal at the Cracker Barrel. This place deserve no less than 4 or 5 stars. Cracker Barrel is still my all-time favourite restaurant. What a fantastic place to eat meals!"}
{"text":"Food sucked and the server didn't even put in half our order so half of our guest didn't even get to eat after a 2 hr wait to be seated. If I could give them minus zero in the rating I would never again."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed because I used to go to Cracker Barrel all the time and he always had good food good service I was surprised we were there Saturday about 4 in the afternoon and the food came out all mixed up wasn't right I had to send some of my food back the girl was very aggravated at me because I had to send it back and after all that the food really wasn't Cracker Barrel what I'm used to so I may try it again maybe it was just a bad day for the cook and the waitress to know I just feel like calling a manager they were busy so that's why I feel about it"}
{"text":"It was ok. Had the hostess not bumped into our chairs or table every time she came around us without so much as an excuse me it might have been nicer. Britny the waitress was great."}
{"text":"Not jumping of Joy or exaggerate, but it was a nice experience and the atmosphere. Great service our server that morning very nice. That made our breakfast when someone is attentive with the customers. Nice breakfast my girls loved it , the little shop and the rocking chairs. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Seriously, I have and still eat at Cracker Barrel outside of Nevada. Food Quality is sub-par. Restaurant and parking are to small. I do understand the idea of demand being high in order to keep the doors open but a 2 hour minimum wait at the southern location and the Craig Road location has the same issues. Employees are not the problem it is the concept and design of both locations. I can get the same quality food for half the price at Denny's.
Will not be back to any Las Vegas location. You will be successful but from Tourist Dollars not mine."}
{"text":"Place is great waiters are very nice and the cat fish was amazing can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"A southern country theme combined restaurant & gift shop, I definitely see the charm in this old-fashioned chain! The decor & appearance depicts much of the south -- with wooden rocking chairs lined up on the long front porch waiting area, walls covered with old fashioned memorabilia of the 1900's, & the gift shop carrying a wide variety of random classic items. The menu was a tad overwhelming, as it was very extensive... with a separate one just for breakfast (which is served all day)! 

FOR HIM: 
Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast
- Sirloin Steak (or country ham or pork chop)
- Three eggs cooked to order (scrambled for him)
- Fried apples
- Hashbrown casserole
- Grits
- Buttermilk biscuits & sawmill gravy

FOR HER: 
Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast:
- Two eggs cooked to order (over easy for me!)
- Grits 
- Buttermilk biscuits & sawmill gravy 
- Hashbrown casserole 
- Country Fried Steak (other option was chicken fried chicken)

Not a grits fan so we did not eat any of it, but we definitely enjoyed the biscuits and gravy! The hashbrown casserole was very good (crispy on the top & soft on the inside) and I found the fried apples to be a nice sweet touch that I saved for dessert! I also requested to try the famous \"Jam n' Apple Butter\" (which you have to ask for to get) -- which personally resembled an apple sauce taste. Not bad! Country fried steak was also very delicious! No complaints from me.

On the downside, I know this a new location that just opened last week and I get they are still getting into the swing of things... but we had 5 different people serving us which made it a little confusing. We were given the wrong food initially (he didn't realize this until he saw the steak was well done when he ordered medium rare and was wondering why he got a baked potato & mac n' cheese) -- and when he did get his steak, it was well done AGAIN. Hate sending food back, but it was completely brown on the inside. He got the third steak and it was medium well with no pink, but he was too nice to say anything and waste another steak. 

The food was absolutely delicious and the service was just as good... but I have to say the ambience seemed very chaotic and it was very loud inside. It would have been soothed with a little music maybe (which may or not have been playing), but it was just SO extremely loud inside -- we found it a little distracting and not very comforting while trying to eat our comfort food. :P But would we come back? Absolutely! 

PRO TIP: Wait times can be extensive. Check in online to have an idea of your waiting time! Then check in with the hostess at the kiosk to verify you're there. ;)"}
{"text":"Don't know what anyone else can say but...

Service--constantly offering to fill up my coffee. They offered a coffee cup to go.

Food--was great. Country fried steak and the French toast

Service and kindness is key...great job"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here, simple, good down - home food! Breakfast is my favorite.  There are some misses once in a while in the kitchen or staff at every location  I have been to, but in general... I  love the sweet tea, but get 1/2 & 1/2 so I don't  have too much sugar. The bacon and bisquits are my favorite,  anything else is a bonus and yummy! They have the best green beans if you are there for lunch or dinner.

Waiting for a table? They have a country store full of candy, candles, clothes for all ages, toys, household decor and books on tape that you can rent to listen to while you travel, very cool idea!

I know I love the nostalgia of it too!"}
{"text":"When we're not counting calories we go here. The food tends to be not so health-conscious, it is good old comfort food. Is not the best but it's also not the worst the food and the service are very consistent and the cheesy hashbrowns are very yummy. 

I actually prefer Village Inn but Cracker Barrel is a close second"}
{"text":"The food and experience was great. Cracker Barrel is the best for it's nostalgic trinkets and candy. The store has cute clothes with sales and its so fun to look around and shop while you wait. Such a good place for some yummy brunch and fellowship. Teddy is the best waitress ever and we will always request to be in her section. She is awesome!"}
{"text":"First timer at this location. Breakfast was good. pancakes were delicious. Server was alert at all times. Wait time to be seated was 5 minutes or less."}
{"text":"The food at Cracker Barrel is consistently good.
The rating criteria is based mostly on the employees,
and the employees at the location on Chandler are
great, especially the server, Krisann.
She actually listened to what we said, got every
detail correct, and was very attentive."}
{"text":"I know this is going to sound crazy but I've never been here before!! From the time I entered the store/restaurant to the time I left I felt so welcomed!
My waitress Deb was terrific!! She checked on us, made sure we had everything we needed and thought I was crazy when I asked her to put my turkey bacon in the microwave for 1.20 hahahahaha I turkey bacon was perfect for me and she will never forget that! 
Deb had it going on!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever been too. Only reason I'm giving two stars is for our server Diane. She was so nice and was great. She had to deal with the mess ups from the horrible kitchen staff that repeatedly made mistakes. 

We went for a birthday dinner and was told an hour wait. Ended up being about an hour and half which was okay because there was 10 of us. Diane was great with her service and very friendly. She went above and beyond. Very happy with her service. When our food came out they only brought two of the plates. 15 min later I finally asked a manger where the rest of our food was. 10 min after that they bring our food or what we thought was our food. Wrong table. It was another guests food. They finally bring the rest of the food, it was all messed up. Sides and wrong chicken. The server put the order in right she showed us the ticket. We waited another five min for the last plate which was a medium steak it came out extra well done. One end was bloody and red. Not medium at all. 

We definitely won't be coming back anytime soon. Seriously this place needs to get it together. Thank you to Diane for doing the best she could. I hope his place gets better soon, I was really looking forward to Cracker Barrel :("}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a country style breakfast? I'm such a fan of Cracker Barrel and I forget that I work right up the street from it (probably a good thing). My buddy and I were craving breakfast for lunch once again. I think we're on some unspoken quest for the perfect breakfast for lunch place. 

I am so glad we headed to Cracker Barrel today. I had \"Mama's french toast breakfast\". It should be called \"Mama's stuff you full because she knows damn well you ain't been eatin' right without her there platter\". It came with 4 slices of sourdough french toast, 2 eggs, your choice of bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and of course I had to order a small side of the hash brown casserole. Of course. I washed all the artery clogging goodness with a large OJ. YUM. Everything came out hot and fresh and with maple syrup. Real maple syrup, y'all! My lunch buddy had the country breakfast that came with eggs, bacon, biscuits and gravy, and grits! We were both so happy we were giggling like little kids in between bites of the great breakfast. For about the same price of another competitor's breakfast platter, we got a fresh baked, hot off the griddle and huge breakfast. I think we've decided that this is a favorite from now on! 
....or have we???"}
{"text":"Have been eating at Cracker Barrel in Iowa & Utah since I was young & it never changes.  Always good, wholesome food & people.  I always shop while waiting on my breakfast & love the rocking chairs outside.  Always preoccupied if there's a wait.  My fav is the Eggs in a Basket, simple & made perfectly.  Mmm!"}
{"text":"I am just not a fan although I have been to Cracker Barrel way more times than I like to admit. When I lived in the Midwest we did Cracker Barrel for breakfast all the time. So when they opened one here, I thought ok great 'Breakfast'.

I have been to this location three or four times. I believe a couple times for breakfast which is your standard breakfast items and truthfully a restaurant would have to drop the food on the floor and scoop it up in order to screw up a standard breakfast. It really was your standard eggs, potatoes, grits, toast and breakfast meat deal. No whoopee.

I did dinner here and my daughter called it \"Old people food\" meaning the food was bland and ordinary. I thought it was a bit better than a Swansons Hungry Man mean, so very average!

So for the desserts, that is where the redemption starts and endfs. I will say the Coca-Cola cake and the Apple Dumplings are very good and probably the only thing decent at any Cracker Barrel.

As for the service at this Cracker Barrel, they are very fast and quite friendly but everything is still just average."}
{"text":"Have only eaten breakfast there. Not bad.  I like that they have grits.  Not many places in town offer them.  Grits remind me of the pastina I ate as a child.  Their hash brown casserole is quite good, though servings of it are small.  I get a Sampler that includes grits, eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, hash browns, biscuits, gravy, and apples in small amounts.  The service is friendly and efficient.  Prices are reasonable.  Decor very country.  The gift shop has lots of junk and kitsch but upon closer inspection has some items from the past that bring back memories, such as types of candy and snacks.  Also, unlike some places I have breakfasted, they don't make you feel like an oddity because you're dining alone."}
{"text":"I liked the pancakes. Do they use the world's smallest chickens to lay the world's smallest chicken eggs? My portion of scrambled eggs seemed awfully tiny. I cleaned my glasses and put them back on but my portion was still small. 

As to the kitsch and tchotchkes they sell: does anyone really need to waste money on that stuff?"}
{"text":"We drive from Sacramento to Rocky Point Mexico as much as possible.  We drive home through Arizona and always stop here.  We have had lunch and breakfast here.  I find myself appreciating the air conditioning, cold iced tea, and down home food, especially during the Summer visits.   

The most recent visit, 07/06/15, was for breakfast.  Eggs, cooked as I ordered, sausage, biscuits and hash brown casserole.  All was good!  I felt my cholesterol rise with each bite, but continued because I knew it would be a while before I ate here again.   

It's nice that the restaurant kept my 6 year old busy and quiet for the whole meal.  

We did not stop again for food until Fresno."}
{"text":"I like breakfast here! Apple cider in a frosty mug or hot chocolate.  Yummy Applewood bacon, delicious biscuits, hot from the oven! What's not to love!? The have delicious sweet tea and sugar ham as well! 
The staff is always friendly! !
Did I mention the store where you can buy candy, syrup, jam, toys, clithes, holiday decorations and cd's!? They pack a lot into the space available! !
They are all over the U.S, which is nice when traveling to be able to go to a place where you can get home style food at a reasonable price, although prices have gone up quite a bit in the last few years, it is still less expensive than many places.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Save your time and money and go to iHop. A long wait to be seated. Long wait to have our order taken. Long wait for our food to come to the table. When the food finally came, it was brought out by someone other than our waitress, which isn't bad. However, one of the orders was wrong and was sent back. It took over 15 minutes to come back corrected. Bad communication amongst the wait staff was the root of the problem. Once we started eating the food was underwhelming. I've been to other locations in different states and this was the worst experience I've had. And the coffee was crap."}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday night hardly anyone in there took 5 min for anyone to even ask about drinks  then rushed us to order took for ever to get refills but the best one is our waitress  walked buy look at my glass no tea in it walked away disappeared for 8 or 9 min  walked over and dropped the bill on the table last time I ever go there to eat chain places are the worse bill was 26 some thing  I did leave 2 buck tip lowest I have ever left ever"}
{"text":"Our server Briana was very sweet and friendly, she make me feel I was a family of hers. Food was hot and fresh, portions were great."}
{"text":"Well shoot... I can't believe I haven't written a review of the Cracker Barrel yet!

I was in AZ a few mos back with family and boy is it different from Seattle. Not in a bad way - Who doesn't enjoy warm, sunny weather? But I did notice that there are an awful lot of strip malls and chains here in AZ. Driving around looking for a place to eat we passed PF Changs, Chilli's, The Cheescake Factory, etc. All kinds of run-of-the-mill, not so special/memorable places to eat that you can find anywhere else in the US.

But... the Cracker Barrel? I had to go again. The first (and only other time) I'd been to a Cracker Barrel was when I was 8 years old and visiting Orlando. That whole trip was so memorable for me because I spent it with my grandfather who took me to Disney World. One night we had dinner at a Cracker Barrel and I'd never experienced anything like it before. Rocking chairs on a big porch out front while you wait for a table, a gift shop full of stuff that you want - but maybe don't need - and classic, All-American fare. For cheap, too!

As we pulled up to the one here in Peoria I spotted the rocking chairs and smiled broadly. It was just like I'd remembered! Through the gift shop you could reserve a table and shop while you wait. I found a cute AZ souvenir for my sister and within a few mins we were seated at a big table in a room that resembled a massive country-home family room. It was cozy, it was interesting, and the menu kicked ass. I got the Cracker Barrel dinner special that included a variety of small plates so I could try a lot of different items. There was pickled okra, chicken and dumplings, ham cooked two ways, corn, mashed potatoes, and more. Even though the food was just slightly above microwave meal quality, there was something comforting and awesome about it. Nothing blew me away but I just loved it anyway. Maybe it was the memories of being small and having never seen a Cracker Barrel before, maybe it was just the name Cracker Barrel... who knows! But I'd still pass up all those other chains for a Cracker Barrel no matter where I am."}
{"text":"I give 5 starts for the pancakes..  everything else is mediocre. I ordered a breakfast sandwich on sourdough. The bread was soggy because it wasn't toasted enough.  They put the wrong egg on my sandwich. I ordered over-medium and got scrambled. They did give me a new egg on the side that I swapped out but I had to wait for them to cook it which probably added to the soggy bread situation. The bacon, sausage and eggs are all so-so.  Biscuits and gravy.. I've had better.  I would come back for pancakes only and maybe try the chicken fried steak next time."}
{"text":"Came to get good for take out, waited 30 minutes & when I was brought my food, it was cold!!!!! SMH........order placed at 2:04, ticket from kitchen 2:13, brought to me at 2:28.....you do the math as to why food was cold........"}
{"text":"We visited this place today and we were amused with their store attached to the restaurant. It is a good distraction while waiting for our name to be called for a table. On the other hand,their food was not great. Their serving is small,the food tastes bland and the quality does not equate the prices. This place must be popular because of the hype and the ambiance it offers but we want our money's worth for the food. This may not be a bad choice for breakfast but there are better places to go."}
{"text":"First time here, and I must say it was a pretty good experience. First, the online waiting list is ingenious...all restaurants should do this, it was so convenient! Service was great, my unsweetened ice tea was constantly being refilled. Of course I ordered breakfast, and I already love any restaurant that serves grits as a side dish to your breakfast! And the biscuits were soft and fluffy! I absolutely love the hash brown casserole and all it's cheesy goodness! I was not a fan of the smoked sausage patty, seemed a bit dry. Also can pass on the corn muffins. And I also like that the country store sells  cool Halloween stuff and it's only July!"}
{"text":"Food was cold, veggies in salad seemed expired. Waitress wasn't very helpful, she was standing across table from customer when I walked by, I even said excuse me when I walked by, she said, \"Thanks for interrupting our conversation"}
{"text":"I felt obligated to write a review for CB just because it was a little tradition the ex had to stop here whenever we hit the road for a trip, incoming or outgoing, while living in Phoenix and because I've been asked by some of my Seattle colleagues what it's like.  

It's an interesting chain because it's one of the only ones I know of that have the old timey theme.  The front of the restaurant is a \"country store\" selling knick knacks, road trip items, penny candy and some plain odd-ball crap.  The decor is all clap board, complete with an old porch, rocking chairs and barrels to play checkers on while you wait.  The walls are hung with what I assume is partially authentic paraphanelia from the 40's such as old rolling pins, spice cans, signs etc.  

There was normally a short wait or no wait at all.  This review is based only eating breakfast.  The ex had no interest in their lunch or dinner items.  Their biscuits are solid, the gravy is okay but could use more flavor if I'm burning my calorie quota, the applesauce, grits, pancakes and eggs... all okay.  Being a potato freak, of course, I LOVE the cheesy potato hash!  

Like the other reviewers here mention, it's a solid performer.  Always consistent.  Always the same.  Prices are reasonable and service is friendly.  One of those places safe to bring your family to for a Sunday meal or out of towners hungry for breakfast.  The sort of place you'd be likely to see in the background of your kids' early photos.  Oh yeah, and they have peg games to play on every table."}
{"text":"The service was good and the staff nice. Otherwise a one star. The food was tasteless and/ or bad tasting. The presentation made not want to eat the food. I should have taken a picture of what was served. Yikes. 
Find another place for country home style cooking !!"}
{"text":"First timer I had heard how great this place is and finally checked it out.  
We had the dumplings, Mac n cheese and the sampler plate.  All was great!  Especially the dumplings and Mac n cheese.  Our waitress forgot many items and we had to ask for things but she was friendly and we knew it was a busy night.  
Price was extremely reasonable also."}
{"text":"Wow,  everything is so delicious I wish we could have come sooner. It's very delicious and the atmosphere was awesome they are expanding the menu We had the  catfish oh how wonderful plenty to eat enjoy all the different flavors can someone roll me out of the door because I can't walk!"}
{"text":"So happy Cracker Barrel is so close to our home. As always the food is good as are the prices.  I think  one thing I like so much about Old Cracker Barrel chain restaurants is I can shop in each one for unique items.   There are also cute home items. We never wait long for a booth or table. They have the best lemonade in my opinion. Service is always great.  Big huge selection of food special's."}
{"text":"Ahhh, yeeeaaaaah. My favorite restaurant, hands down. I'm a country boy, born and raised, so finding good ol' down home cooking like this at a restaurant was a giant blessing! My God, it's so good. I usually order the Country Fried Steak, green beans, mashed potatoes and gravy, and fried okra... all with two delicious biscuits on the side. They give me all of the for under $11!!! I never leave unsatisfied. To tope off the great food, the store is incredible. I just picked up the Gaithers gospel collection, some stocking stuffers for Christmas and a bunch of old fashioned candy. CB does good for the soul."}
{"text":"We just had their sunrise breakfast and an extra bit of bacon and it fed both my wife and I. The meats were wonderful and everything else was served just perfect. The service was excellent and of course you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is classic Southern food, I love coming with my family making memories. Family Friendly environment. The food is amazing its the best restaurant I always end up comparing it when I go to other, I always tell my kids \"These biscuits n' gravy are good but Cracker Barrels Biscuits n' Gravy are to die for\". My family and I live in Southern California so whenever we come out here it's tradition to go to Cracker Barrel !"}
{"text":"This review is for the Craig/ North las Vegas location. I have to say I had my doubts after reading a lot of bad reviews online but my husband and I were really excited to check this restaurant since we had never tried it before. We went there on Thursday around 8:30 am and no wainting time at all, walked directly to our table. We even didn't like the first table they gave us and asked for a window table and they said it was ok. The restaurant was not full yet, around 9 am we saw more people coming in but at that time we were enjoying our delicious food. 

ok. the food. We didn't know what to order because we wanted to try everything!!! My husband ordered the old grandpa breakfast or something like that, it was a fried steak with gravy of course, hashbrown, biscuits, gritts and a side of 2 buttermilk pancakes. Everything was delicious, not cold like I had read in previews reviews. I had the yogurt, eggs, turkey bacon and blueberry muffin. Again no complaints. the coffee was not so hot but mine was deccaff so I can't talk about the regular one. Good service. As soon as we were seated the waiter came to take our drinks order and soon after our food order. food took a little long to come but no super long. They were refilling our mugs frequently and asking if we needed anything else and taking plates away. Never had to ask for a waiter. they were very helpful. overall great experience. we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't believe everyone on the \"crazy wait time\". Arrived around 9ish got seated immediately. Waiter was very pleasant, nice and friendly. Food was great. Nice home cooked meal. Loved it being it was my first time! Waiter was very knowledgeable. Knew that this location was 1 of 3 locations that didn't have the cashier to the right when exiting. I found that funny, and now it's sticking with me. Loved the little store/gift shop. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I was already not a huge fan of this place, but it's where my mom wanted to eat for her birthday so I couldn't say no. We were seated immediately but our server took forever and seemed irritated. Our food was taking a while so I asked for a cup of hot cider and he brought me a cup that was still wet from just being washed but still had lipstick stains on the rim. I asked for the manager which also took forever. We almost got up and left but our food finally came out with the manager following. I showed him my cup and he said \"yep you're right.\" That's it. No apology. He blamed the slow service on a bus that had pulled in earlier but looking around it didn't seem very busy. I felt sick after eating my catfish. My \"steamed\" broccoli was raw and my mom never got her cornbread. We finally got the check which was rang up incorrectly. I called for the manager again and he said he'd just take care of the check. Still no apology. Definitely won't be coming back here ever again."}
{"text":"The food is basically what you or your parents could make at home, but I kind of like Cracker Barrel. I go there with my fiance and she really loves the store, which I also enjoy looking through. I really like the look and feel of the restaurant. Its kind of a cozy place to eat at."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast I have ever had in a restaurant. Had to walk through a crowded novelty store that you could barely get through to get to the desk. No one at the desk! Finally someone shows up and acts like it is a big deal to seat us. Places against a wall in a corner at a little table. Ask to move and she didn't say a word just toss the menus on another table and walked off. The atmosphere is just a bunch of junk from garage sales on the wall. There is no theme - just stuff! The waitress was actually very good! Unfortunately the food was horrible. My scrambled eggs were pressed so hard they were like a piece of thin cardboard and they were ice cold. The sausage was burnt. My wife's breakfast was so cold she thought it had been frozen at one time. Checking out there were 5 registers with no one on them."}
{"text":"UNCLEAN.
Tables and floors sticky.
My Thursday special of Turkey and stuffing was dry, and not nearly enough gravy to make a difference.
The corn bread muffin was flavorless and dry also.
However, the kale and sprouts side dish was tasty wiith the walnuts and cranberries.
I won't eat here again."}
{"text":"Yes there was a wait!! Don't go if waiting will influence your review!!!  That being said, everything was delicious!  Our server was so sweet and attentive, and everyone that we came into contact with was super nice, and busting their butts!!  Thank you Cracker Barrel for finally making it out here!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible. We arrived over an hour ago. They quoted us an hour. Fine. Whatever. Half an hour into our wait they said only 15 minutes remaining. 50 minutes into our wait they said we were third in line. It's now been 1 hour and 15 minutes. Not seated. Pissed off. They've seated 20 other groups when we were supposedly third in line. No apologizes or explanations. Don't eat here. It's terrible, terrible, terrible customer service and mediocre to poor food at best."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel!  When I lived in Flagstaff, I was a regular and now when I visit Chandler, I plan to be a regular at the Mesa Cracker Barrel.  Starting with the wooden rocking chairs on the front porch to the nostalgic candies and the Americana/Country gifts, Cracker Barrel will not disappoint in taking its guests back to a simpler time.  True country cooking is not meant to be rushed and neither should your experience at Cracker Barrel.  We had the pleasure of taking our 2 year old grandson out for his Cracker Barrel experience today.  This is a truly kid friendly restaurant which even includes country styled wooden booster seats, crayons, coloring sheets and a great kids menu with something for even the most discerning toddler's palate. 

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and I don't believe that it should be restricted to the morning hours and neither does Cracker Barrel.  My absolute favorite breakfast at Cracker Barrel is the Sunrise Sampler which delivers more than enough food food for two, unless one of the two is your grandson who steals the bacon and sausage off your plate...The Sunrise Sample includes: two eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, home made biscuits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole, smoked sausage, ham and bacon.  

Everything I've experience on the Cracker Barrel menu is incredible.  You must be sure to leave room for dessert.  The hot double chocolate fudge coca-cola cake with vanilla bean ice is an absolute to die for dessert.  There is lots of easy parking and CrackerBarrel is a stone's throw away from the Bass Pro Shop.  Need I say more...make it a full day outing!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Cracker Barrel in general but I thought I'd give it one more try. We had a breakfast meal this time. Gravy was bland and tasted like flour mixed with water, sausage was burnt and tasted like fake meat or jerky it was even red, what? Bacon was burnt as well. They are very busy and I think they must make mounds of bacon and sausage and let them sit getting hard. My eggs came out wrong and had to send them back twice. No creamer for coffee only half and half...gross. Toast was thin and burnt as well. In short, not worth my $10 for sure. Going home to eat now......"}
{"text":"I had good expectations going in but was very disappointed. I ordered the burger and my wife ordered the trout. Her trout was a little dry but alright according to her. My burger was as well done as it could be without being burnt. I was never asked how I would like it cooked. I asked for a sweet potato instead of the fries and received the smallest sweet potato I've ever seen. It was the size of a small apple. The burger was replaced but the service was mediocre at best.I don't think the server ever cracked a smile. When we asked for a couple more minutes to look at the menu I looked up less than a minute later to find her quietly standing at our table staring at us. Creepy! When we were leaving the hostess asked us how everything was and when I said I was very unimpressed she said nothing and told no one. Nice concept and ambiance. Bad service and food."}
{"text":"I have been back several times and have been mostly satisfied with everything. They have microwaved a few items to re heat them but that's OK. I recently tried their grilled haddock and it was really good. 

I also like the grilled chicken tenderloins. I have those with the hashbrown casserole and pinto beans. I get the apple bran muffin instead of the corn bread. I still don't care much for their cornbread but everything else has really improved. I am so glad it has because I really like to browse the Country Store."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel : 
Old Country Store 
I really didn't knw what 2 expect wen I was asked 2 go there 4 Brkfts. Once I drove into the Parkin lot, it looked like FUN. I read \"Old Country Store\" on the sign and started there 1st. I purchased a Big Checker Board Game 4 my grandkids back home on Maui. I also found some Old Skool candies ! What a treat. 
Then the Breakfast came out. WOW ! What a Feast. Everything was so Good and Tasty. Ck out the pic. Mahalo Susie Q"}
{"text":"I stopped here on the way home. I had their Chicken and Dumplings with a salad, corn bread, green beans, and fried apples. As if that wasn't enough I had the pumpkin custard for desert. I didn't eat everything or lick the plate. I tasted some really great food. Awesome service by Lisa. Very friendly staff. Bought some gifts and left super happy! This restaurant works as a team. They help each other and things are not just on one server! A must go to place when you are close to Las Vegas!!!!  Their sweet tea is the bomb! I order mine half sweet half unsweetened! Yummm"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We've been twice and both times waited 35+ minutes for our food which wasn't good. Once the food arrived it was room temperature... won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Some days you just want food that is bad for you in the best way. My typical Cracker Barrel order:

- 2 eggs, scrambled
- Biscuits (with butter)
- Hashbrown Casserole (mmmmm cheesy potatoes)
- Cinnamon Apples

For whatever reason this combination doesn't exist on their menu, so I usually end up ordering the Hasbrowns, Apples and Biscuits with a side of two scrambled eggs. But whatever. The point is that all of those things together are amazing. They make you feel like you're 6 years old and out to breakfast with Grandma. Plus, the crazy kitschy store sells John Deere baseball caps. How can you not love that? Add the fact that it's cheap as hell...plus the peg game on the tables...and it basically makes up for the fact that the servers appear to be hired from the local halfway house. 

So yeah. When your arteries are feeling particularly too clear and you need some warm, salty, buttery goodness....head to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I have some vague memory of Cracker Barrel from my East Coast childhood, but I hadn't been to one in decades. There are no Cracker Barrels in Los Angeles, where I live, or anywhere on the West Coast for that matter. Which is just sad. 

Last year, on a road trip to Arizona, some friends and I were looking for a place to stop for lunch. When we spotted the Cracker Barrel right off the 10 freeway, my pals got VERY excited about going there, since they're all from the South and all had fond memories of Cracker Barrel. The four of us had a delicious meal of Southern cooking and then amused ourselves in the kitschy gift shop.

This year, we knew we'd be stopping there again on our way home from Arizona, and we had two more people in the group who were only too happy to join us in our gustatory pilgrimage. I had the \"chicken fried chicken\" (a breaded breast fillet served with white gravy) with fried okra, green beans and cornbread stuffing, followed by blackberry cobbler and ice cream. Plus the best biscuits I've ever had anywhere. Heaven! 

The service was friendly, timely and attentive. My sweet iced tea glass was always full. Everything on the table was perfectly prepared and exactly what the person wanted. There wasn't a single disappointment in the entire meal. We all left full and happy. I know we'll be back again next year. 

There needs to be a Cracker Barrel in L.A."}
{"text":"Basing this on my experience at this time. Server was extremely slow only 1 table of 2 in her area and no service. Another server saw me siting with no service and took my beverage order. Main server would be right back she said, she did not. When she finally did she had the nerve to say I'm sorry I must not have moved fast enough. Really!!!  What about asking for help I mean come on it's not busy at all and give me some lame excuse. Not impressed Cracker Barrel. When it's busy I get it not when you have 1 table."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here this morning and noticed that there has been a significant change since they opened 5 months ago. And it is NOT a good one to my dismay.

1. We put our name on the online wait list which said about a 5-10 minute wait, arrived, checked in, and was told we were the 2nd group to be called. We were okay with this, sat down on the provided rocking chairs to enjoy the nice weather. About 5 minutes, the overhead speaker called out name, we went inside and was told to wait for a bit before we would get to our table. 10 minutes later we were finally lead inside the dining room but waited another 3-5 minutes next to the fireplace because our table was still being cleared. Really? Why call us in only to wait, and keep waiting when we could have waited outside where we were comfortable. 

2. Service was bad and the restaurant was pretty full so it made it even worse. Not only did our server speak in a hushed tone that it was diffulicult to hear, but she looked like she would rather be anywhere else than there. I had to also prompt her to ensure that the right food choices were noted (i.e. hash brown casserole or fried apples). My husband's water was never refilled and my coffee was on refilled once at the end of our meal. Our server did check on us after our order was taken and only came towards the end to close out our check.

3. Food was barely edible. Side of gravy that came with the biscuits was cold and unappetizing. Buttermilk Pancakes was more sugar than pancake. Bacon was fried within every inch of its like and way overdone. Ordered eggs over medium and it was barely near that. Sliced Ham steak was thin than a deli meat cut and drier than the desert air. Hashbrown Casserole was soggy and not crispy as I had ordered. 

4. Floor staff that were present and just standing around. It seemed that the focus of the management was only on clearing and turning tables WITHOUT any care to ensure that food quality and quality service was maintained. They may have high personnel costs but it may be because they are paying a bunch of folks to just stand around and hardly do anything which shouldn't be the case when you have a full restaurant. Managers are also in sore need of a refresher in management style and customer service. Before we left, my husband observed one manager harshly tell our server who was attending to another table to \"hurry up and clear that table\". Maybe that is why she seemed afraid/timid if that is their leadership style! Only one I noticed constantly moving, attending to/checking on her customers was our server from our visit 5 months ago. Really wished we had her today and our experience would have been much better but alas it was not so. 

Overall, if this was the very first time that we visited Cracker Barrel, we would NEVER, EVER come back!"}
{"text":"As crazy as this might sound this was my very first time trying Cracker Barrel! I will say that I absolutely loved everything about Cracker Barrel! The store, the food, the decoration, and the staff are amazing. I would definitly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Food was ok  but entertainment  was better if you like to people watch \"holy smokes\"senior citizen paradise omg"}
{"text":"Had the SIRLOIN ROAST BEEF with 3 sides. The dinner portions are much better & then throw in 2 biscuits and its a great meal. Every employee in the store was so nice. Coming from California and living in NY for one year, I was not used to the hospitality. Today was my first day of vacation from work and visiting the state of Arizona and stopping by Buckeye, before heading to TUCSON, TOMBSTONE, & PHOENIX, I am loving it."}
{"text":"If I could go here everyday I would. Home cooked meals for awesome prices. GREAT quality, FRESH food!!!"}
{"text":"This has to be my favorite breakfast spot.  I love the crunchy edges of their pancakes.  Even when they are packed, the food quality is consistent.    I am a happy girl."}
{"text":"I was on vacation from Southern Calfornia and we ate here for breakfast. I have never been to a Cracker Barrel. It was so good! The French Toast and Hashbrown Casserole was delish! We are so coming back here to eat next year!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The french toast and hashbrown casserole is so good! I was visiting from Southern California and I wish we had these there! Great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Just went to this location for breakfast and sat for 15 mins being told 3 times they would be right with us. There were only about 8 customers in the restaurant. This is the 3rd time I've come here on non busy times and had to wait unreasonable amounts of time. Not sure what the problem is but management needs to work on this. Needless to say my husband and I walked out and probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Yes I'm giving a chain restaurant 5 stars. This is pure comfort food so u can't come wanting to do major substitutions on your order. But I like this establishment because of 3 things: food is good, interesting ambiance of early Americana, and a great price point for a sit down establishment.  Sure they have country fried chicken steak but u can make healthier options here. I ordered pinto beans and turnip greens for $7.19 and it was delicious. Partner got the Saturday special of chicken & rice. He gobbled all of it. Loved the mushroom sauce. With drinks and a blackberry cobbler it was an amazing price of $26. We pay the same price at a fast casual but we got full service here! Esther was a great waitress to us. Intend to come here whenever we do the LA to Chandler drive."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  I'm not a huge fan of Cracker Barrel .. not sure why besides the coffee is horrible, service is ALWAYS a it or miss and no one ever gets the eggs right but .... any who!
Monday morning while running errands I decided to grab Breakfast because Cracker Barrel was just  minutes away.  I ordered something small.  Hash brown casserole, bacon and biscuits.  

The restaurant was pretty empty.  My server had 2 other tables besides mine, all three tables only seated a party of 1.  3 tables, 1 woman each.  The very nice server lady took my all order of only coffee, biscuits, hash brown casserole, and bacon.  She came back shortly later with has brown casserole, biscuits and fried apples.  She asked if everything was okay?  I told her yes with the exception of my missing bacon.  I say this with a small.  She apologized and told me she forgot to sub bacon instead of fried apples.  She said I'll be right back!

She came back a while later with another plan order of has browns and 2 more biscuit.  She said  sometimes like double!  Enjoy I'll be right back.  One would assume she gave me that extra order of hash browns and 2 more biscuits.  She quickly ran off to talk to the lady seated behind me.  

When she finally came back she asked if everything was okay.   told her again .. Ma'am you forgot the bacon ... AGAIN!  No worries ... I'll just take the check.  he thanked me over and over for being nice even though she completely screwed up and she made me some coffee to go.  

I kindly threw it in the trash immediately after I left out the restaurant!  I won't visit again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! I came in 20 minutes prior to get table for 28. Manager refused to prep an area until all of the party was here."}

Comment - I arrived here just after 6 AM the restaurant was mostly empty so the service and the condition of the restaurant had not been challenged yet..."}
{"text":"The poor rating is mainly because of slow and poor service!  The food has always been delicious - but then again, it is a chain restaurant and they all generally taste the same.  Their store is nice and neat,  but sometimes the bathroom is in dire need of a thorough scrub-down cleaning to get rid of odors.    
I generally visit this location in the late afternoon between 3:30 - 4:30PM, just before the dinner rush.  Therefore, it wasn't crowded when I went in.   One time I walked out ten minutes after I had been seated by the host; no one ever showed up to take my order. However, just as I was picking up my things to leave, a waitress appreared.  Too late -  I don't have time now!!    On another occassion, my meal arrived and part of it had spilled all down the side of the bowl and the other bowl had stray pieces of corn in it.   Regardless of the poor appearance of the food, as well as the the foreign bits of corn in my greens, the food was still very good.   Quite frankly, the server didn't seem to notice how messy it was.    More often than not, the main problem is getting the food in a timely manner - even on to-go orders.  One time I placed a to-go order at the front counter and it took 15 - 20 minutes for the food (Beans & Greens!!) to come out.  It's a good thing I didn't order chicken or a burger!!!    As stated, the food IS good, but the wait is rediculious."}
{"text":"What the heck is happening here?  Two sets of silverware sent back because they looked dirty, got the 2'nd sets and they were just as bad: water spots all over them. 
I ordered 4 veg plate: three greens and pintos, onion and chow-chow. Food runner/waiter brought to our table, and fingers were touching the overflowing small cup of chow chow, and the onion for pintos was a thick cut slab. Our actual waitress got me a new container of chow chow, and by then - I had tasted the greens. They were horrible - NOT the Cracker Barrel greens that I've known since they came to Charlotte. No flavor, hardly any meat, and bland - not to mention how they looked,  pintos were barely lukewarm. Manager came a apologized profusely, and said he checked the greens and they weren't prepared according to recipe. When asked about the onion slab, he said CB doesn't serve chopped onion - and gave some silly reason. I suspect it's too big of a hassle for them.  Manager was very nice, as was our waitress. But at that point, I was done.  For what it's worth, the usweetened tea was good, and hubby said his chicken pot pie was good.  Funny thing- one lady seated beside us sent her silverware back for another set also. Don't have to worry about me ever going in there again."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!  Long wait - but we expected it :-). Food was extremely good - service was very good. All the wait staff were very nice and accommodating.  Pricing was decent. 

My one complaint would be that they bring the bread out with the meal. I think they should bring the bread out before the meal due to long wait times and people being antsy. 

All in all, just as I remembered it and we will be back!!"}
{"text":"We eat at this Cracker Barrel 2-3 times a month, however, the past couple of visits the food has not been very good. The featured salad with chicken, beets and sugared pecans looked delicious in the picture but I must say was not good. The chicken was like frozen chicken fingers that were not hot, not cold, just room temp. The vegetable soup I ordered on a recent trip was just luke warm and my silverware looked dirty. I was told it was just water spots.  My husband ordered hashbrowns and they were very greasy as were the corn muffins. It was not crowded but service was slow.  What's happening here? Come on Cracker Barrel get it together."}
{"text":"Met some friends here. The food was good as was the service. I had 2 issues-there were not calorie counts on the menu as required by FDA. I later asked 2 managers. One said they tried for a couple of weeks and then put on a separate brochure. The other manager had no idea this was available. I ordered a breakfast and the server changed the sausage to bacon without asking me. I wanted sausage. The server placed the order and then forgot about it until I reminded him at the end. Sausage was then dried out."}
{"text":"Cant compare to the cracker barrels from the east coast. Food was not freshly made unfortunately and was sitting out for a while. Friendly service though, hence the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back form Florida... not much to choose from out here...

I tried the shrimp & grits.. AWESOME!!!!  Never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here!! 
And try the crustless coconut cream pie... MMMM!!!
good attentive service."}
{"text":"Old school breakfast, with lots of funky supposedly \"country\" crap in the front store.

Very limited vegan options, but I had toast with jam (the butter substitute was not vegan), potatoes and a fruit bowl that could hardly have been smaller, and passable coffee. 

Suffice to say I was still hungry after, and we ended up going to Starbucks across the street after - which I almost never go to.  

I'll pass next time, and go into downtown Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We came here after we walked out of another establishment for not waiting on us....we now think it was by the grace of God!  We were waited on by Kaylie and could not be more happy with this little gal!  She was courteous, friendly, funny, professional, and quick witted!  When we were seated our drink order was promptly taken by another server who apologized for Kaylie who was waiting on a large group, we were dumfounded by how quickly he was at our table!  Kaylie was not far behind and scooped up our order and we were feasting in no time!  She came back and retrieved our dessert order and we rolled out shortly after!  I would highly recommend CB and if you do choose to stop in...ask for Kaylie!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now, and not once have I have been happy with the food preparation nor has my wife...Not sure who the chef is, but the entire menu SUCKS! My wife had \"liver bites\"...Just Horrible, the same night I had biscuits that taste like they were still uncooked...

I will not be returning to this place. The floors were filthy as well, and restrooms were nasty! 

The woman who takes the money when you pay your bill is somewhat rude and credit card machine is primitive...

Maybe selling retail goods is more their business, but food and dining are NOT!"}
{"text":"I was in the area getting acupuncture and really wanted a good breakfast.  My initial thought was to go to the Waffle House when I saw the sign coming off the highway.  The Waffle House and Cracker Barrel is probably 1 block from each other.  I wanted the Texas Cheesesteak sandwich from Waffle House and cheesy hash brown casserole from Cracker Barrel, ideally, that's what I wanted but didn't want to make two stops for the obvious reasons.  I decided on Cracker Barrel.  It was a Saturday afternoon (around 1 pm).  They had no wait time for a party of one so I was seated rather quickly.  My server came over immediately asking for my drink order.  I ordered water and OJ for when my food came out.  For brunch I ordered the old-timers (I believe that's the name).  It was grits, biscuits with gravy, sausage, cheesy hash brown casserole, and soft scrambled eggs with just a little cheese.  I received grits, biscuits and gravy, cheesy hash brown casserole, sausages and 2 hard fried eggs with 2 slices of barely melted cheese.  

A different server delivered my food.  She literally just came over, said nothing, and put the plate in front of me.  I called out to her, excuse me ma'am.  She kept walking.  I started eating, started with the grits.  Once my server came back she noticed immediately that the eggs weren't cooked in the way I ordered them.   She said don't worry I'll put an order in for more eggs.  I started eating.  By the time she came back with my scrambled eggs I was almost through with my meal and they were slightly cold.  In fact, I didn't have anything left except for biscuits and jam.  I'm thinking those eggs belong to someone else because they weren't hot, warm or fresh.  They were cold.  I also noticed there was a party of one sitting behind me.  He ordered fried catfish, fried okra and mashed potatoes.  When his order came out he sent his fried okra and asked for it to me \"hot and fresh\", so clearly there's an issue there because the same thing happened to me. 

I took about 2 bites of the eggs before I noticed a piece of brown-ish, blonde colored hair in the eggs.  I have black hair ... it wasn't mine so I left the eggs there.  My server noticed I barely ate the eggs, dropped the check and asked if everything was okay.  I was ready to go at that point so I said, everything was okay and I headed to the register.  She told me they took the cost of the OJ off instead of the cheese because the cheese cost more than the OJ!  I thanked her and headed out.  I'm not a huge fan of Cracker Barrel so I didn't bother complaining to management.  I just won't return."}

{"text":"Where do  I begin....We came to Arizona for a family birthday. The whole drive to Arizona all we did was talk about how we wanted to eat at Cracker Barrel. On the way home we decided to have breakfast at Cracker Barrel. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. There were 7 of us. We sat down the waitress took our drink order right away. We still need a couple of minutes to order. The waitress came back and we all ordered. We were talking g and playing a game they had on the table. Suddenly, we started noticing that people who came in after us were getting their food. We asked our waitress where our food was, because we had been waiting an hour. No need to tell you our food was cold. After complaining to the manager, he comped us our food. He also offered to redo our food. We were hungry and in  a rush to get home. If you have a lot of time, like cold food, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel recently opened in the neighborhood. Always good for southern comfort food. The chicken & dumplings were bangin'. The best part of our our meal was our waiter, Carey! He was pleasant, professional, and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried the Cinnamon Streusel French Toast Breakfast plate. Was very good!! A ill sweet, but so tasty. The ambiance in the store is always so homey."}
{"text":"The image of CB is awesome, and it works in the sense that they get the church crowd, and since it seems old fashion - people think the food is healthier. 

But that's from a business perspective. Personally I find it strange that it works, but it does. I am not a big fan och CR, but I do have to eat here some and the service has always been OK. Sometimes stellar, but that is not my average impression - to float between OK and stellar, is a good average still. 

The food is also average. And from a health perspective it is basically same as fast food. They cheat to cut costs like everyone else in the dirty restaurant business. However, if I found a place that was like a CR out in the wild west, but wasn't a franchise - I would have loved it. 

Absolutely nothing to write about in your diary. But I have no real complaints either. Middle of the road experience on all accounts. Still impressed that the image fools those who wants to believe that is it something its not. I want to too, but I cant fool myself that way."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite places to eat.  My husband and I have eaten at Cracker Barrel many times at the Chandler Blvd. location and in various states we've visited.  However, today was not a good experience.  We went in the afternoon to eat at Cracker Barrel and Hoops was our server.  The food took triple the time it usually takes to get your food.  Hoops said that there was a new cook.  I ordered the Haddock Dinner.  As one of my sides, I selected a baked potato.  My husband ordered the Chicken & Dumplings Dinner.  The food was excellent but the service was not so good.  The place was not real busy since it was the afternoon.  When we received our check, my Haddock Dinner was more than I expected.  I asked another server if there was an upcharge for a baked potato.  She said yes.  I said that I didn't order a loaded baked potato and in the past I've never been charged for a baked sweet potato.  I was charged $1.50 extra for the baked potato.  The server never said anything about the baked potato being an extra charge.  I spoke with my server Hoops and told her about our disappointing experience.  She said, do you want me to get my manager.  At first, I said no.  Then, I thought that if no one ever says anything, nothing will change.  I spoke with the manager in the red shirt and glasses about our experience.  He did not seem to be concerned.  I paid our bill at the counter and left.  In the future, we'll think twice before going to Cracker Barrel to eat.  I would have completed an online survey at the Cracker Barrel website but I didn't receive a receipt from the cashier."}

{"text":"This place is great! I was in town for Spring Training. I saw many baseball fans in their teams clothes. Arrived Sat morning around 9:30am and the wait time was less than the 30 min. wait the hostess had promised. The whole staff was very  courteous and helpful. The food was even better than expected, this being my first visit to a Cracker Barrel. I had the chicken fried chicken eggs and grits. I am sorry that there isn't one in my state."}
{"text":"We always stop here on the way back to Dago , the food and service is always great. Today I'm all sniffly from this awful weather in az and the waitress brought me tissue instead of napkins.. Very sweet .. Thank you"}
{"text":"Food was ok we had the sampler plate.  The service was wonderful, our server was Stephanie.  Was on top of things, glasses were never empty.  Service with a smile!  Thank you!  I would give 5 stars if the food was better."}
{"text":"We were a party of 15 waiting to he seated. We were told that the wait was 1 hr and 15 mins. We waited longer than that. We still waited because we ate at the Cracker Barrel in Boston and loved it. The called our name at the counter and made us wait another 45 mins and when we were seated, the food took longer and didn't taste like how we remembered it to be when we ate at the Boston branch. I get it that they just opened but they need to be honest about the wait. The food again was... Ok but not a restaurant i would go back to when i'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"One of the last places in town that can fulfill so many desires in a single visit. For me personally it's not just a restaurant where I can feel a hole in my stomach but there's times when I need to fill a hole in my spirit. And this place never disappoints. I can always come here and see friends that are open for conversation, helping me do what I love most, \"Making Cracker Barrel Memories\".

Just on a side note, if  you have never been there around the holidays. Or had the opportunity to see the unique gifts they have, you might not be aware of the gift wrapping that they offer \"FREE\" regardless of money spent. You are given multiple choices in regards to boxes, colored paper, bows, ribbons etc. Complimenting the season or occasion. Truly making the gift personal and unique."}
{"text":"you can't go wrong here, food was great the campfire chicken was very good. hope they keep this in the menu."}
{"text":"le'sigh. I suppose I had higher expectations for such a big restaurant. The food wasn't worth bragging about, but the staff was friendly. I did order the fried chicken BLT and it was good, I tasted other foods with the people who I came with and was unimpressed. Needs work..."}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I have had in some time, it took forever for our meal and when it finally arrived it was cold and was no better then a Denny's, tastrd about as bad I imagine dog food would taste like, I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"We went here yesterday, and was told by the server that there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. I looked through the window and the place was only half full. It turns out that a kitchen employee had called in sick, and instead of seating more people, they would make them wait until the kitchen could catch up. MMM, sounds like a bad management decision to me. We finally were seated, and our food was ' OK \". I had a Cheeseburger & Fries, and my Wife had Chicken Fried Chicken. The gravy tasted like it came out of a package, but everything else was OK."}
{"text":"The food was ehhhh at best,  service after the hour wait was slow and sub par. I was really looking forward to this place for the longest time. What a disappointment.  Food was reheated she forgot things. Bad bad bad experience. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I grew up on Cracker Barrel and missed it when I moved to Las Vegas. I wish I could give them a raving review, but unfortunately I cannot. I have had bad experiences almost every visit. the first was the rude hostess when I asked about our wait time. Another time, our waitress forgot about us, the entire meal and we had to ask for a supervisor. 2 different times we were missing items we ordered, and couldn't find our waitress to let her know until she brought us our check. The last time and why we have not been back is because we sat for 20 mins before someone came and took our drink order, then our food was not right and we had to flag down a manager to fix our order and again we never got drink refills because the waitress was not attentive at all. I would say it was because of it being newly opened and it was busy but that was not the case. I hope they get it together because back home i never experienced these problems at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really cool it has a home feel to it they have a store in the front with some really nice things some candy and games for the kids not
To pricey either I had dinner and had chicken fried steak it was great the Mac n cheese is the best I ever had and the hush puppies were really good too and the sweet tea was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Grand Opening Day on My Birthday!!!  I love it!  Hawaii should have Cracker Barrel all over the islands!  Awesome service and good!  Great Job Cracker Barrel!  
Mahalo Nui Loa!  We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 03/22/15 around 1400hrs.  About 20 minutes after ordering, waitress returned to inform us the Chicken Salad was sold out & there were no sweet potato's, so we would have to order something else if we wanted to eat.  We went again on 03/27/15, around 1030hrs. 30 minute wait for a party of 6, after an hour, we finally got our food.  Gravy was cold, sausage patties were WAY over smoked.  Never saw a busboy the entire time.  Both times waitress's were very attentive, but the entire staff seemed entirely over worked.  It is obvious this Cracker Barrel isn't managed correctly.  We'll visit other Cracker Barrel's, but never this one again."}
{"text":"Have eaten at many cracker barrels across the country.  Always good food.  This one we waited 20 minutes to get in for a 1:00 lunch on a Monday.  
Fried chicken salad did not disappoint.  Hubby's chicken fried steak was great as ever.  Try the creamy vadalia dressing for any salad as it is amazing.  
Will be back on our next trip through town."}
{"text":"Not bad. You get a lot for what you pay for. Fried apples are delicious! It had a very Southern feel to it."}
{"text":"We came, we tried, and it was barely average. Average food with a rude hostess (Megan) and I will not be returning. The servers and all the help we got after being seated were great. As for the food, I got French toast with eggs. The eggs were barely warm and French toast lacked flavor. The highlight of the meal was the crunchy ends on my sons pancakes which I liked, but the flavor of the actual pancake was just \"ok\". There are a lot better options that I will continue to go to."}
{"text":"We thought this establishment was everything we expected.  Good coutry food and friendly service.  The price was pretty good and the fireplace was huge.  The country store had a lot of cute knick knacks.  A nice place to kill a few minutes.  They did have some Christian inspired art that I liked."}
{"text":"This was the first time that my family and I had been to Cracker Barrel. I had heard of rumors of long wait times, but when we showed up we only had a wait time of 10 minutes. The time went by quick while we looked around their store. 

Once we were seated, we were surprised that the prices were reasonable. The staff had a southern hospitality vibe to it, and the nice country feel inside. 

The food was delicious and the portion sizes were very good."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant focusing on Southern comfort food, Cracker Barrel is as good as it gets.  You get quality food, reasonable prices, great service, a shop in the front where you can buy candy, souvenirs, and tchochkes, along with friendly,  sort of down home, roadside atmosphere.  Those of you from CA need to stop at a Cracker Barrel while you're in AZ as there aren't any at home.  Not every Cracker Barrel is created equal, and the service at the Buckeye location knocks the socks off the one in Goodyear.

 I had the grilled catfish, potato casserole (cheesy potatoes), fried apples, and biscuits.  Everything was excellent and the catfish portion was bigger than I've found at other locations.  If you open up your biscuit and put some of the fried apples on there you've made yourself a biscuit apple pie.  Oh yeah!"}
{"text":"Not very many food options! I went there at brunch time. I was feeling breakfasty but they didn't have many breakfast options so I got a cheeseburger instead. I would've definitely had something breakfast-like though."}
{"text":"Our first impression of the store when we walked was a very friendly environment. We were greeted right away, and promptly escorted to our table. Brittany asked us right away what we wanted to drink. She was very prompt to bringing our drinks straight to the table and extremely knowledgeable of the menu when we had questions. We had our food in very short time. The presentation of the food was excellent. The taste was hands down, probably the best crackle barrel we had in a long time. We never needed to ask for anything. They brought it to the table before we even had the chance to ask about it. The manager even stopped by to see how everything was. I would highly recommend to visit this restaurant if you're in the Chandler area."}
{"text":"We tend to dine at Cracker Barrel's all over the U.S. as we travel since there aren't any quite yet in California. We are pretty familiar with their food, menus and practices. This particular Cracker Barrel is uniquely out of touch with reality and company practice. Usually, there is a wait for seating most everywhere, but here it seems to be way longer than usual, even when it isn't all that busy. Why?  

Once seated, your server usually is quick to come to the table for drink orders and perhaps even food orders if you are ready. That was fairly true at this place, too, but then be prepared for an extra long wait for the now cold food to arrive. Managers start by using the \"that's just the way we do it\" defense - which doesn't work once you have been to several other Cracker Barrel locations. We waited some 45 minutes to get cold food that should have been hot. It appears that the biggest problem areas may be the kitchen and the management - why argue with customers when they are long time customers?  The same basic problems happened on our first visit here so we tried again. It was WORSE the second time. Finally a different manager tried to resolve the problem, but by then the die had pretty much been cast. We hope Corporate staff will intervene soon and fix this place so we can return pleasantly."}
{"text":"OK, I'm NOT usually fond of chains (In N Out Burger being the exception) but I have to hand it to this place - they have one of the best breakfasts I've ever eaten. I got the \"Uncle Herschel's Favorite\" with poached eggs (steamed, really, which is even better), grits, biscuits and gravy, and a nicely spiced grilled catfish fillet which had a nice crispiness on the outside but was still moist on the inside. The gravy was too much for me to handle, but I'm sure it's still good if you like such things - and the rest was happily eaten. My daughter loved her pancake and turkey sausage patty.

The food prices are astonishingly reasonable too. Of course, then they get you in the \"country store\" on the way in and out. I couldn't resist getting some of the sticker books and this very cute dress for my daughter - but even there, the prices weren't bad. 

Besides, this area is ALL chains. Might as well go to a decent one."}
{"text":"Wow....this was one time that you need to read all of the bad reviews. The service, the food, the restaurant itself were all below average. I have never been to a Cracker Barrel, and I can honestly say I won't go again. There were 6 of us eating, and nobody liked their food."}
{"text":"If you don't like a wait don't come here on Saturday or Sunday morning because it's inevitable. Other than that any other time you can pretty much walk right in without a wait. The food is average American Comfort with the huge Southern Hospitality portions us fat Americans have grown to love and expect. The service is usually A+ ( on average I usually tip the servers 25% because they are so nice and welcoming). I prefer the Breakfast menu over the Lunch & Dinner selection. My favorite breakfast is the Blueberry pancakes that's served with REAL blueberry syrup, I usually get bacon and scrambled eggs on the side. For dinner you can't go wrong with the Catfish or Chicken Fried steak. The price or the food and quantity/quality are right on. Don't expect fine dining here but do enjoy the fat induced food coma afterwards."}
{"text":"I wish we could give the servers their seperate rating cause our waiter, Darius, was perfect! He was casually informative, friendly, he refilled our glasses before we noticed they were getting low, he checked on us a couple of times and made sure to offer us dessert. BUT when I asked for a Cherry Coke, he said they don't have that and have no grenadine, he tilted his head to the side and with a wink offered to make me a Raspberry Coke. Darius brought it to me with our bread and it looked as unassuming as my girlfriend's standard Coke but one cautious sip in and I'm now hooked. My meal was made with this fruity syrup infused lovely. So, if not for Darius's personality and the Raspberry Coke I'd have almost nothing nice to say about our meal.   

The buttermilk biscuits were burnt, the only thing caesar about our salad was the dressing and maybe the cheese. My grits were cold and not cooked right, the noodles of the Mac n cheese were overcooked and it was about cold and our mashed potatoes (I wanted baked potato but they were out) with gravy were about cold and under seasoned. But the ribeye was pretty good, although also about cold. Everything was served fairly quickly, so we weren't sure how everything was hot warm or hot."}
{"text":"First time there and it was very crowded .. came for dinner but if you add your name to list online it's not that bad. They even text you to tell you what your estimated wait time is! I love the country store and there's a ton of seats for you to wait on. Once we got seated it was still busy to where it took the server a minute to greet us. Nic was our server and she was the sweetest!! She was very patient with all the guests around us and some of them weren't very nice to her. It was busy, cut the staff a break. When our food took awhile to come out, she went to check on our food and it came out within minutes. Food was delicious and I can't wait to go back! Ask for Nic as your server! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and was let down big time. Ordered a breakfast meal with all the fixens. Did not get any of them!  Silverware was dirty with crusty food on it. They even screwed up the bill by overcharging us. Will never go to this place ever again!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well...you just have to visit a Cracker Barrel once in a while.  We were driving from Phoenix, returning to California when the four of us decided to stop.  We hadn't been to one in awhile and it was that same as the others.  Friendly folks, good food and a good price.  I didn't care for their sausage that much, but their bacon was quite good. The scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly.  The shopping in the country store after eating is always fun."}
{"text":"They have really good comfort food at a very comfortable price! On the weekend this place will be slammed and anytime there is a baseball game beware. Even when its busy the service is really good and the food is always amazing. The pancakes are crispy on the edges =) Definitely try hash brown casserole. When I don't want breakfast I cannot resist the chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"I stopped in to this cracker barrel several months ago. I had a nice late lunch the meal I ordered was good the meal I ordered came with two side dishes so I ordered mash potatoes and a side salad. My family order the same thing which was a special her salad came before the meal well mine never made it out until the actual meal. 

     I have been to restraunts they bring the appetizers with the main food and their time I had to turn down the main food just so my party and I could could enjoy an on tray or appatiser."}
{"text":"Service was bad server kept avoiding walking past our table customer service should be taught."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel! It reminds me of my childhood and my grandparents. This location is conveniently located off of hwy 74 in Matthews and is a great meeting place for out of town guests. My family and I ate here today and had a wonderful experience with our waiter. His name is George and if you're smart, you'll request to be sat in his section! He was awesome! He made our dining experience wonderful today. I don't eat at a cracker barrel unless someone from out of town is passing through, but honestly, I might make an exception once in a while now! Their food is yummy and southern and it tastes like home :)"}
{"text":"Saturday morning was suppose to be a special day for my mother but it ended up being a disaster. We decided to bring my mother here for a healthy breakfast meal on her birthday. We waited 2 hours outside to be seated. It ended up being a lunch meal. Our server Amanda didn't make it any better with a bitter attitude as she would come and go. She forgot to take one of my guest order and forgot the half of another guest Order. When we noticed that one of my guest didn't get served, we told her. But her attitude was pessimist, insisting that my guest didn't order anything for herself. My guest was upset and didn't want to order anything anymore since everyone was finishing their meals. When Amanda turned around and walked away she rolled her eyes. Apparently, She guess she forgot there were 10 guest seating at that table besides the one she was arguing with. Very unhappy with this experience. Will never come back."}
{"text":"The food here sucks.  I will never come here again.  Food tastes like it was frozen and defrosted and they just microwaved everything.  The worst part was the turkey sausage I ordered was raw.  I literally took a bite and got a glob of raw ground turkey.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy and grits with turkey and everything was bland.  I'm sorry I waited 40 mins for cheap diner service and crappy food."}
{"text":"I had a taste for Chicken and Dumplings and this Cracker Barrel did not disappoint! I usually go to Cracker Barrel for breakfast, so this was my first time going for dinner. The dinners come with three sides and your choice of biscuits and i think corn bread. My boyfriend got the catfish dinner.. he got one fried piece and one baked piece. 

Our food was delicious and so were our sides. The Chicken and Dumplings took me back home to my great aunt's kitchen, like when i was a kid! I will definitely go back to Cracker Barrel for dinner in the future. 

We also had great service at this location in Robinson. Everyone was extremely friendly and our food was served quickly. 
(I was so excited for our food that i forgot to take a picture! lol woops)"}
{"text":"First time here with the family and the experience was great! The food was delicious as we came for breakfast and the atmosphere for the place was very home warming. When you first walk in it's a little store and then as you keep walking you will see the restaurant. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was only because it was cold throughout the whole place and while we were eating, but sure made it feel like Christmas was around the corner."}
{"text":"We have been to many Cracker Barrel restaurants throughout the country so we have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  This Cracker Barrel did not meet the service or quality of a Cracker Barrel.  Our waitress was very nice but not very attentive.  Our biscuits and cornbread came after we finished our meal.  The biscuits were undercooked.  So why the 5 stars?  It's the professionalism the cashier and manager showed us when we commented about our experience.  They both acknowledged that they needed to improve and welcomed our feedback. A lot of corporations will say they welcome negative feedback so they can improve but that's not always the case. In this case, the manager really listened and thanked us for our time.  I know this restaurant will continue to improve with strong leadership we personally witnessed.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cracker Barrel, they have delicious food amazing decor and a store that has such unique buys. I love going here for breakfast for the hash brown casserole and for dinner for their fried chicken. I also love biscuits they are so yummy with some of their apples. This location has great service they are very nice and it's also fast service. I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Breakfast is never disappointing! Hashbrown casserole is the very best along with the warm apples! So much food, I brought plenty home! The quaint country store is an added treat..!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and overall, it was less than ok.  I went during breakfast time so my food was certainly fair - I mean, its breakfast.  How can you mess up breakfast?

It was really the overall experience that I received with the staff that doesn't make me care to come back, but, it's a cool looking restaurant with a cool looking store upon your entrance.  I'd like to try lunch and dinner so I'll probably return hoping to receive a better experience."}
{"text":"I think I ordered the wrong item at this place.  They are known for homecooking, and now I regret ordering a cheeseburger (I'm a creature of habit) but the meat had a very very strange flavor.  My BF ordered a corned beef sandwich and that was very good.
The store has cool and different items, definitely worth a trip on your way out of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrels are not all created equal.  While the vibe at the Goodyear location is great, the service leaves a lot to be desired.  We were served by a \"Rising Star\" (he hadn't yet earned any gold stars for his apron).  He was sure nice enough, but kept coming back to clarify our orders, we had to go get our own napkins/silverware because he gave us our food but not with the necessary silverware, and he was very slow to come back to check on us and refill our drinks.  Worst of all, he brought AC's salad without the deviled eggs and didn't explain that they were out of cooked eggs until after we brought it to his attention.  He apologized and seemed sincere, but the service left a lot to be desired.

The food we did receive was up to Cracker Barrel standards, but the overall experience was really disappointing especially after looking forward to my yearly Cracker Barrel experience (they don't exist in California) since last spring."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Cracker Barrel esp. when we are traveling.  Have never had a bad experience , however we walked in, cashier said hello, we waited by hostess stand, and waited, and waited , saw no waitress, no hostess, finally a customer says you have to seat yourself.  He showed us where the menus and silverware were. Did not have to wait very long for waitress , food took a little longer to get. Talked to waitress a little bit. She told us that they do not have a hostess until 8:00.  Okay, why does the cashier not tell us that while we are waiting?  This same cashier was very pleasant when we checked out.
Maybe new management ??"}
{"text":"The service and the food was amazing! Michelle was our waitress. The entire staff was helpful and worked as a team. It was pretty busy we went on a Sunday during brunch. We had so much food we ended up taking home 3 carryout containers. We ordered pancakes, homestyle chicken and a steak/egg breakfast. Everything came with sides and to top it off they brought us a side of biscuits. Being from the midwest with a southern upbringing this place made me feel at home. I WILL be returning again."}
{"text":"This place has some rude and racist employees here! I kept saying nooo it's not jst that person but this has been my third visit and I will never ever return! After the old lady rang me up today I had an e gift card I wanted to use since I had 40.66 left on and she's like we dnt even take those ok tell me how was I able to use it last week and now this time was an issue?! So since I wasn't able to use it, I told her to cancel my to go orders and she yells out to her boss who was jst next to her Oh void THIS since she can't afford to pay for it! I didn't say I can't afford to pay it I wasn't going to waste my money since I had the gift card with a balance on it! Then manager says u need to print it out next time what's the difference of me bringing in a copy of the e-gift card when u could easily scan the barcode?! Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Blueberry pancake... 5 stars! Use of real butter and (mostly) maple syrup = excellent! 

Everything else is a one star or less.  While it's cheap and fast, and the service is very (surprisingly) friendly, the food is really average or below. In my mind, there is only one reason to go here: pancakes. I actually don't like pancakes anywhere else, but here they have a crispy outside edge that is just amazing. Couple that with real butter and real maple syrup, and I'm in heaven.

Don't even try to come on a Saturday or Sunday breakfast or lunch unless you want to wait over an hour. But those delicious pancakes are available anytime of the day, so hit them up on an off time or for dinner and you'll slide right in."}
{"text":"Anytime the wife and I crave for a good comforting breakfast, we always end up here.  When we go on the weekends right before noon, the place is usually busy.  With being only a party of two, we normally get seated pretty quickly.  

The staff here are always very friendly and on top of their game.  Never had bad service during the times we've went.  

The food is always good.  The wifes favorite is the roast beef dinner which is a MUST try!!  I like ordering from their breakfast menu.  The country fried steak breakfast is delicious!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what is going on with this location.  We were tired after some shopping and we looked forward to a good meal.  Overall the food was not very good and portion size was on the small size.  Too many things to complain about in a review.  I actually got my main mean on a side plate.  The waitress was great and even helped us pay for a older gentlemen's meal before we left.

My son said the bathroom was disgusting and opted to drive 20 minutes home to go."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain, but it's comfort food in large portions at a very reasonable price. The service was great and everything ordered was correct . This location has always been consistent!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and the patrons seemed moderately happy with the place. 
I ordered my eggs cooked over medium and they came out over hard. The waitress offered to take them back and get them cooked properly but I will never return food because people are a-holes and do nasty things to your food for complaining. Can't believe they charge 2.50 for a cup of coffee and won't offer flavored coffee creamer. They also offer toast but no peanut butter. 
It just seems that I should have stayed at home and cooked for myself because it would have been cheaper and it would have tasted better.

I may go back but it won't be anytime soon."}
{"text":"I do like their food, but why advertise a to-go option if you can't hold up your end of the bargain? I called to place an order at 9:30 am and was told to swing by to pick it up between 10-15 minutes. It's currently 10:55 am and I have yet to receive my to-go order. It wasn't like I ordered everything and the kitchen sink, I ordered two meals."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for breakfast,lunch,and dinners that I've been too and continue to come too"}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy here is the best. 
Breakfast or lunch is always great here. Butter milk Biscuits.  The service today here was great."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Staff is oblivious to customer needs. Food is overpriced and bland. I will only return to shop in their store but will dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came to this Cracker Barrel after hiking to the first saddle of the Cholla Trail of Camelback Mountain. I figured I earned the big ol country breakfast I was going to endure. 

I was seated pretty promply as I came in on a Wednesday afternoon. After perusing the menu and waiting a few minutes, my waitress came by. I ordered the chicken fried chicken with hashed brown casserole, scrambled egg whites, grits and biscuits. Everything and I mean EVERYTHING was slammin! I almost drank the spare gravy. The fried chicken breast was crispy, yet still moist. The grits weren't clumped. The casserole was so yummy and cheesy! Oh but the biscuits, the BISCUITS!!!! I ate one with butter and honey and the other with butter and preserves. Each were heaven and being that I ate them at the end my meal, I could only imagine what they would've been like hot.

I SO wish they had Cracker Barrel in CA, but until then... see you next Spring Cwacka Bawwal!"}
{"text":"Waited ten minutes and never was asked for food or drink. They were not that busy. Quite a few of the wait staff looked out of the kitchen, none came out to take my order."}
{"text":"We were staying in Buckeye while attending a regional sporting event with our Grandsons and their Mom & Dad. We saw this Cracker Barrel as we were driving down Watson road right off of I-10. My experience says Cracker Barrels are fairly consistent with their food - so we stopped. It was an early dinner, so not too busy. Service was quick & very good all evening. I had the meatloaf with mac&cheese, green beans, & okra. All were very good except the okra - usually very good, but this batch was not crispy and very \"blah\". Others had burgers (very tasty), open faced roast beef (just ok), and chicken and dumplings (very good). Most of the meal was true to form for Cracker Barrel with a couple of slips. Not major issues - so I'm sure we'll return to a Cracker Barrel near you soon !!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this spot well, it's the only one I've been to so I don't have another to compare it to. The first time I tried it I was ecstatic. The restaurant in itself is fun and inviting while the food is equally enjoyable. You can't beat the huge portions. The apples are a sweet treat and the biscuits are filling that come with breakfast meals. The boneless chicken breasts are very tasty and you get enough to feed two. A nice place for the family."}
{"text":"First time coming to this place and the food and service is terrible. Cold pork chops no salt on eggs rubbery pancakes."}
{"text":"The Sunday chicken dinner is very good. The store outside is someone irritating because they're trying to to sell Americana and everything is made in China. The food though is outstanding."}
{"text":"Always a good choice for breakfast(that's when I always go). It's always a wait but their service is great and browsing and buying unique and fun items at the country store is fun. The food is good and plentiful. A must try kind of place"}
{"text":"Went here once, never again. At least not this location. My friend and I went here for a dinner get together and her food was more cold than it should be and looked like a mess. I should have taken a picture, but oh well."}
{"text":"Really unprofessional management. Had the displeasure of coming to this location once, and never again."}
{"text":"Thank you for a fantastic breakfast before starting the trek west! Going to be hard finding better pancakes and thick slices of bacon anywhere!"}
{"text":"So happy they are here in Vegas. Great food, excellent service, and the atmosphere is so fun. Had to stop in the general store, too."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and the servers were very nice, we received our order in a timely manner. However if your going on a weekend your going to wait over an hour. I highly recommend making the drive to the buckeye location, you'll get seated immediately."}
{"text":"2 thumbs down!! This place is overly crowded with clutter! We had to wait 15 minutes to get seated which was fine but there was no space to wait, I think they need to put a clear waiting spot. We ordered and the food took 40 mins to come out. And I ordered the French toast... IT WAS BURNT!? Server also just took off after giving us our food. Didn't ask if we needed hot sauce or anything. Also when you check out the cashiers are rude and don't smile. If you don't like your job don't work there? And I will not be coming back here ever again. Also very basic!!"}
{"text":"Starting off we had terrible service. There were several groups of people that sat around us after we sat down they got there order in and food before us. Said ok cool I can be patient, I sorta lost my patience when my water remained empty no joke (20min) before I had to ask another waiter for a refill. Food comes and what do you know, not even hot it was barley warm like it was sitting, kids didn't get ketchup or mayo with there burgers, wife's sausage tasted weird, and no biscuits but everyone else got some.. I normally never leave a crap tip or complain seem that I am in the food and beverage industry but this crap here was ridiculous. Won't be taking my wife and kids here ever again. Bad choice to bring her on her 30th birthday hoping for a great experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service here. While there was no wait to be seated, we did wait for a few minutes before even being acknowledged. The food came out fairly quick. It was ok. What really put me off was that i had just barely got started on my food and the waitress brought the check. Asked if we needed anything else. We said no, but we just started eating. She made sure to say no hurry on the check, but it didn't fell like \"no hurry\".  After getting halfway through my meal, i needed a refill on my soda. I sat there over 5 minutes (not a long time) but 4 servers AND a manager walked by and not once asked if we needed anything. The manager however, did visit the same table behind us 3 times during our visit. Too bad we didn't receive the same attention..."}
{"text":"BEST PLACE TO EAT & SHOP!

Upon entering the store is like walking into your Grandma / or Country's friends home with that faint pumpkin spice / cinnamon / apple butter / bacon cooking / goodness aroma. This is truly a down-to-earth, family, home cooking type atmosphere. I love the warm feeling you receive from entering the doors. The hostess is friendly, the sales associates (if you have to wait & browse) are knowledgeable & outgoing. The layout, the items on display and for sale make this a cozy place to chill & walk around. If you want to extra chill while you wait, just sit in the cozy rockers outside. Note: If it's HOT weather in Vegas, they do have the \"water misters\" on to keep you cool while you wait.

WAIT TIME INFO: The store opens at 6am (no wait time) and probably starts getting busy at 9:30 am with a 1 hour wait time. As I'm sitting writing this, it's 11:22 am on a Wednesday, the wait time is only 30 minutes. YES, I've also been here at 6pm (duh dinner time) and had an hour plus wait time. Don't let the other reviews from people about WAIT TIMES scare you. 

There's a couple of factors that you have to consider when making a \"Cracker Barrel\" breakfast/lunch/dinner 'DO I WANT TO WAIT' decision:

#1: What time of day are you eating? If you want to save yourself some time, call them directly at the Dean Martin location and they will gladly let you know the current wait time. Their number is: (702) 474-1120 and PRESS #3 to speak to an Associate. I did this and they were so friendly! Challenge solved!

#2: They just opened THIS location on July 25th, 2016. Give them a break. You KNOW everyone and their Uncles & Grandmas families will be here PLUS all the tourists? WOW! This speaks volumes. I say they are doing their thing considering the 'craziness' that happens when a new place as great as Cracker Barrel opens. I understand employees that get overwhelmed and it's busy....stuff happens.

#3: If you DO have to wait, take the time to BROWSE the store. THE STORE IS AMAAAAZING!!! Seriously, not fibbing. You can spend HOURS just in their retail store looking at every interesting item like wood wicked scented candles, Burt's bees entire collection of awesome items, Specialty DAD's Sodas, pancake mix, bacon (have to ask them at the register to get you some from the back), cutest baby clothes & toys, women's clothes, UNLV merchandise, various sports team items, holiday decorations, old school & new school candies, kitchen decor, Yankee candles, & SO MUCH MORE!!! CAN YOU TELL I LOVE THE STORE!!

FOOD: Two menus to choose from: Breakfast OR Lunch & Dinner. I always get both. There are a myriad of items to choose from and although I haven't tried everything, it's always fresh and every location I've tried (Utah, Montana and now Nevada) never disappoint me. My favorites include, (Breakfast) Old Timer's Breakfast or Momma's French Toast and I always have a Biscuit WITH APPLE BUTTER and a side of grits...(Dinner), my fav is the Roast Beef Dinner with a side of OKRA, Mashed Potatoes & Grits (no cheese), can you tell I love grits? Btw, the cornbread is sweet FYI. I will come back later to update this area as I try more and more dishes. The Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes are awesome too! Yum, dessert CHOCOLATE COLA CAKE is UNBELIEVABLE! Wow!

TIP: While you are waiting, sit in a rocker outside on the front porch and look over the ENTIRE MENU. There are so many items on BOTH menus that you need time to look it over, seriously, trust me on this.

Overall, excellent experience. I personally love Cracker Barrel and this particular location is clean, friendly and the food (so far) has been a great for myself and my family. As you can tell by my review, I am a Cracker Barrel fan. They pretty much are all the same but since I live 10 minutes away, this can be dangerous for all of us. There is no such thing as 'portioning' here so I am forced to eat the great food.... Wish me luck and hope our paths cross soon!"}
{"text":"Visited 5/8/12...


What can I say, its Cracker Barrel.  Have been there many times.  Never reviewed before now.  Don't know why. 

Southern food.  Had country fried steak, mashed potatoes, fried oakra.  It all tasted very good.  

Went in for dinner.  But found myself very tempted when I was given a Breakfast Anytime menu.  Not too many places that I would try the breakfast menu in the evening, but this might be a place I will have to remember for breakfast in the evening fix."}
{"text":"Packed as usual on a Saturday morning. They have it figured out though. We waited less than ten minutes before our name was called. Our server came by almost immediately to take our drink order. Our order for food was taken and ready in under ten as well. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. I had the cheesy hash browns, apples and biscuits. I love their hash browns and the biscuits were fat and melt in your mouth. Our coffee was refilled promptly. 

Cracker Barrel has delicious food whether it's for breakfast, lunch or supper!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is just okay. Service was fast but was a little over priced for just me and my son. He got french toast I got pancakes and we spent over thirty bucks. kind of wish we would have kept lookin."}
{"text":"Sooooooo Disappointing was super excited to try this place since we have eaten in Arizona. We waited for 45 mins and then waited another 20 when we were seated to get any drinks or service. The service was horrible the food was even worse. The biggest waste of time will not be back."}
{"text":"This used to be my \"regular\" Cracker Barrel when we lived in Ahwatukee. Then I made the mistake of moving back to San Diego & boy do I miss this place! My whole family does,too! We were back for a visit recently & we were not disappointed,except for the fact that our favorite waitress was off the day we were there!
Great breakfasts...you won't leave hungry! I love their salads for lunch,but they have lots of good sandwiches,too! Dinners are good,too. We love their Chicken Fried Steak & Chicken Fried Chicken on the dinner menu & at breakfast,too! My husband likes their Meatloaf. Our son's fave is their Chicken & Dumplings! They make fresh dumplings throughout the day (at least that's what they say on the Food Network) & they always seem fresh to me!
I really hate to give you this tip,because I'm afraid that they'll run out next time I'm there! On Sunday they have a dinner special \"Homestyle Chicken\",2 Fried Chicken Breasts (boneless) with 2 sides & of course biscuts & corn muffins! These chicken pieces are so large (usually) that my husband & I would eat one for dinner & bring the other home for lunch on Monday!
Don't forget to have a piece of Chocolate CocaCola Cake! YUM!
Service is usually great,alot of the servers have been there at least 5 yrs & management,too...keeps the place consistant! 
I can't wait to go visit again...I miss this place!"}
{"text":"We come here every once in a while and I always enjoy the sides more than the main entrée.  Hubs and I shared the chicken fried chicken and it was waaaay to dry.  However, everything else about it was delicious - I love their biscuits!  Service is also pretty decent at this location."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas, where we have Cracker Barrel restaurants, but I can't recall if I've ever actually been to one. A favorite Yelp friend invited me to breakfast to check it out and we had a pleasant, tasty morning.

We tried a couple of the larger sampler plates and tried a variety of dishes- my favorite was the hash brown casserole (get it cheesy!), as well as the pecan pancakes. The grits and biscuits are solid as well. Most breakfast plates have eggs and at least one of the meats, and the chicken fried chicken is a good choice (only on the Grandpa plate!). Whatever you get, the portions are huge, so come extra hungry or expect to leave with a takeout box. 

The biggest tip I can give is to go early (~8am) or on a weekday to avoid ridiculous wait times. If you do end up waiting, browse the country store or grab a rocker on the patio to pass the time. Even at the table, games are provided to engage with your group!"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst Cracker Barrel experience I can remember. They are usually good and I'm a fan. We came o a slow weekend afternoon. The hostess was confused and slow to seat us. The server took a long time to bring drinks, take our order and bring food. She was only quick to bring the check and let us know her shift was done. The food was mediocre. My country fried steak was chewy. The poached eggs were overcooked and rubbery. The biscuits weren't fresh. My husband's sweet potato was burnt. We have young children and the slow service made them restless and a nuisance to other guests nearby. I will be back to Cracker Barrel but not this one."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here. I just went to the country store to buy a rocking chair but the girls in the shop were really helpful! The store smells like the holidays during this time of year. They have a huge selection of candles! I thought everything in the store was reasonably priced for a gift shop. You can find some pretty neat stuff in here. I will definitely be back to get Christmas decorations and candles."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times over the years. Last few times I came in was poor. Today will probably be my last visit. I sat and watched families who parked their car and we're seated before my family. Same size families I might add. Dirty floors, good ol country grandma's food straight out da box. The food is fine. If you are hungry with for kids don't come here. If you don't mind waiting for mediocre food and you are a patty of two, this is your place. It hasn't always been like this. Other locations don't have these issues. They must have had a management change in the past few months. Bye the way I haven't even gotten my food yet. Cracker barrel will have my business, just not this location."}
{"text":"From the check-in host to the dining room to the server and the leadership of Brian. Me being from hometown North Carolina this was the best eating experience I've had at Cracker Barrel!!! 

My 1st time at the new location as a homeowner 
in this area I'm glad you are here!!! Brian you and your team are awesome the food and service was remarkable!!! See y'all soon and have a pleasant day!"}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is very new but very good. I came on a Saturday around 9am with my family of 5. Our wait estimate was 1 hour but that is reasonable on a Saturday morning. The place was packet inside and out. The staff was amazingly courteous and helpful. They have a Frozen Apple Cider on their menu and when I asked the waitress if they could possibly heat it up for me (I love hot apple cider) she got it done! It was delicious. The food was also a bit of a wait but it was very good. I suggest their French toast, it's to die for. I would definitely come back, wait or no wait."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. The price is great for the size of your meal! I believe I got grandpa's favorite? It had grits, eggs, hash browns, biscuits, and fried apples. The grits were plain, everything was alright. The fried apples were my favorite since it tasted just like an apple pie filling. The store was cute and had a little bit of everything. The service was alright, but once you got your check, they were hard to flag down.  Wouldn't necessarily return here though"}
{"text":"My wife were very disappointed, going to the grand opening on Jul 25th. We arrived at 7:15pm, and waited for 1hr & 1/2. in 100 degree weather. We finally got called, we had Julian for a waiter. He took our drink and food order, that's all we saw of our waiter ,we had to wait awhile for both. Manager David Hankins came over to us, and asked us how was everything was. We told him that we were waiting awhile for our drinks and food order. He said we are still trying to work things out. It seemed like he was making excuses for his employees. When we finally got our food order, my wife's order was not right. She order, steak & steak fries. She did not receive steak fries with her steak. Since we waited so long for our order, my wife didn't want to say anything. My order was alright, I ordered the Chacker Barrel sampler. We decided to order dessert, we had more problems. They brought out my wife's dessert without mine. I asked, where is mine? They asked what did I order? I said peach cobbler. After waiting 20 to 30 minutes for our dessert, I received my peach cobbler, not what I expected. It came to me like soup! I told the manager David Hankins about my dessert, again he was making excuses for his employees. This manager, did not apologize for anything that went wrong. He didn't even offer to do anything for us, very unprofessional! He walk away saying if there's anything he can do. We should not have to tell a manager what he should do for unhappy customers! Also we notice employees standing around not helping customers . That could of been causing the wait time for people waiting for drinks & food orders. My wife & I never expected to receive the service we received. We went to a Chacker Barrel in Andover Mass and had Excellent Service and Excellent food. That's why came here, we didn't understand why we didn't get the same Service we received back east. It seems that all employees including Managers need further training on taking orders and having customers wait for a long period of time .We hope that things change around so we can come back enjoy our experience with good service and good food. It will be awhile before we try our experience again ."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and friendly staff. They worked hard to accommodate our large party and made sure our food came out right. The wait was long, but we went during the grand opening. Totally worth the wait. Tammi our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Good food, my husband loves the sweet
Tea and hash brown casserole! The yogurt parfait is delish! Our server was Cynthia and she is very sweet and helpful!  Always enjoy shopping while the food is cooked! True Americana experience!"}
{"text":"Yep, Cracker Barrel.  I still can't figure out why they don't have omelets on their menu.  If an omelet is pushing it then clearly Eggs Benedict is out of the question...huge menu, consistent quality.  Always busy"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best breakfast west of The Oak Table in Sequim. I've never had grits and found them to be a but bland, but the texture was excellent with a bit of soft crunch to go along with their creamieness. The biscuits were light and fluffy and I even enjoyed the gravy (and I never get biscuits and gravy) which was not too rich but very flavorful. I also enjoyed the home style potatoes, in fact they were the best I've ever had. I topped it off with some bacon which was thick cut and had a great smoky flavor. Overall, one of the best breakfasts I've had in quite awhile."}
{"text":"I love eating there breakfast here. Country boy is my fav. Love the steak and hash brown casserole. My order was almost perfect except i got wheat bread not white, i don't like wheat but no big deal. Mike my server was great, friendl, and nice"}
{"text":"The breakfast is so delicious!
Amazing customer service and friendly staff.
They are very accommodating and always so polite."}
{"text":"Waited 30 min, ok it was Sunday, waited 20 mind for cool over cooked eggs, paper thin fat bacon, listed as thick cut, and tuff pancakes, server was very nice  but not worth anything  for a mediocre  to poor quality breakfast"}
{"text":"Classic, simple, delicious food. Went for the Uncle Herschel's Favorite with fried catfish after a long draining day at college. Very good, service is friendly. Love the down home feel of the restaurant too."}
{"text":"Just took a road trip from CA to UT. to visit family.  Since we don't have Cracker Barrels in CA and had heard great things about it, we decided to try it out. We stopped in the St. George, UT and Springville, UT. and those Cracker Barrels were outstanding and the service was top notch. On the way back, we stopped at this location in Las Vegas. This place had the worst service of any restaurant we have ever been to. The food was good, like other Cracker Barrels, but it took more than 10 minutes to get someone to greet us after being seated. Once our order was taken by a manager, it took another 15 minutes to get our food. We never could get condiments as no one bothered to check on us and we couldn't get a server's attention.  I had to go to the hostess stand to ask the hostess for our check.  We will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the food and staff but this is retarded no WIFI we live in 2015 common people please add WIFI I GIVE THREE STARS because of no online connection other then that love the place"}
{"text":"This new Cracker Barrel opened recently in Charlotte on Independence.   It's the first one I've seen in the area that's not off a major interstate.  

Cracker Barrel has good breakfast options (although nothing fancy), so we decided to give them a try on Sunday morning.  For 9:30 a.m., it was surprisingly packed!  Usually crowds don't start for brunch until after church lets out in Charlotte.  Apparently there are many heathens out there besides us.  With the amount of cars overflowing from the parking lot and standing around indoors, our wait was only 15-20 minutes, as promised.  

While we waited for our table, we walked around their country store filled with...well, country stuff...and also old-fashioned candy treats.  With the crowd waiting, it was difficult to maneuver around, but we managed until our name was called.  

Once inside, we got excellent service.  Our server was very attentive, stopping by every few minutes to make sure my coffee cup never got empty.  My usual breakfast option (\"The Old Timer\") beckoned to me, so I ordered that.  Eggs, cheesy hashbrown casserole, and a choice of meat.  Not to mention biscuits (ask for apple butter!) and grits.  It's a very filling breakfast, and the coffee they serve is delicious.  

After we ate, I grabbed some Chick-O-Sticks and Clark's Teaberry gum (my favorite as a kid) in the store for the road."}
{"text":"Love Cracker Barrel. I've eaten dinner and lunch here and it is always good but breakfast is what this restaurant does best. If you eat at places like Denny's and IHOP etc. you'll love Cracker Barrel. So much better than other restaurants. Great service great food !"}
{"text":"I am a former fan of Cracker Barrel. Yesterday's meal tasted like the veggies had been dumped out of a can into a metal tray, shoved into an oven for a few minutes, then dumped on the plate. Absolutely no seasoning. The catfish was tasteless. Best part was the tartar sauce. Everything else was tasteless. Oh...and the restaurant smelled bad. Service was good. This was the same Cracker Barrel that, about 6 months ago, provided me with my worst restaurant experience ever. That time, on my first bite of dressing (thankfully a rather tender bite) I bit down on a jagged piece of glass. Caught it immediately and came away without injury. Called Cracker Barrel HQ on that one after conversation with the manager. I can forgive the piece of glass better 
than the consistently awful food. No more Cracker Barrels for me, anywhere, anytime."}
{"text":"I always love a Cracker Barrel meal and this was no different as far as the food was concerned. The crowd of people jockying for a place to stand inside the store for a table and the noise level of the resturant was overwhelming. I will chalk it up to being a Saturday morning and is probably one of their busiest times. We look forward to visiting Cracker Barrel since we do not have them in California. This is are second time at this location and we will be back just at a different time of day."}
{"text":"Bomb as f***!!!! Since moving to Arizona I been wanting to try this place again . Most of the location I been at are pretty much the same, great atmosphere, great service and food. I love how they have a little shop for you to. It's a great concept for when the wait time is long you can be looking around till you get seated. French dip was so good I love ah ju sauce and my bf had the trout which I picked at too . Lemon pepper always goes well on most fish for flavor ."}
{"text":"Food was okay, our server took forever to bring our drinks and food. The steak was dry. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a restaurant in probably 5 years. Started with server telling us about her tracheotomy. 30 minutes before we got our drinks. This  chain has went down faster than the Titanic.  Wish I would have went to a fast food burger joint instead. We were a party of six with four kids and kids eat anything!!  One son would not eat his omelette because it was over cooked and the sausage within taste old or rotten. My omelette was the same and I ate 1/4 of it then felt sick the rest of the night. Another sons burger was under cooked and raw with over cooked potatoes with it. Son only ate half because of its taste. Daughter ate pancakes and I was surprised they got those right. Another son ordered chicken fried steak which was over cooked and chewy and the gravy on top tasted a few days old and too pasty and tasted like flour. Server was one of the worst ever. Can't really blank her as the food was not her fault however she should have had some training. Was not treated for almost 15 minutes. She would only take our drink order when clearly we had been there long enough to know what we wanted. Waters came 20 minutes later. Food showed up 35 minutes after ordering. Clearly unexceptionable!!!"}
{"text":"All across the country Cracker Barrel is the go to place for breakfast! This one is no exception. Even in a busy Saturday morning in December our waiter is on it and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"We have been craving Cracker Barrel for years! Stopped here on our way to Vegas. OMG it did not disappoint. So so good. Chicken fried chicken. It's what i get, it's what i love. I was concerned after seeing some mediocre reviews...but i am here to tell you, come eat this Southern goodness."}
{"text":"The food here was ok. However I got some dinners to go and when I was eating my greens with my catfish I almost swallowed some green plastic. Gross. I couldn't bring it back since I was busy with training and I was visiting AZ. Don't think I'll be returning either."}
{"text":"I'm so glad there's a Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas, my food was good, I got the Tuesday Lunch special with country green beans and Mac & cheese, I added salt and pepper and my food taste good. My server Ashley was very nice, friendly and provided good customer service.  I will definitely be back and this time with my kids."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way from Chicago to Minnesota. I know that Cracker Barrel is not fast food, but this particular restaurant was extremely slow! We were told we'd have to wait 20 minutes for a table, okay, we can browse the gift shop. We got seated in about 25 minutes, all and I mean literally all of the tables near us were dirty! Why on earth didn't they have someone clean the tables so people waiting could be seated? Not only did this ruin my appetite, in addition, we waited another 45 minutes to get our food! So when we paid the bill at the register, we were asked if everything was okay...um...yeah..no! We asked if they were short staffed and were told that the \"kids\" they hire always call in sick! Hello??? Don't hire them and/or fire them and start over! And, yeah, the food wasn't worth the aggravation! Just drive on by this one...."}
{"text":"Have eaten at many Cracker Barrel locations over the years, always happy with the food and service. LOVE the chicken fried chicken dinner!"}
{"text":"What is the hype of Cracker Barrel?  I'm still trying to figure that out.  Packed parking lot, but a short wait to be seated for 3.  We waited no more than 15 minutes.  Service was definitely good here.  We were first timers so we rec'd some recommended selections.  Husband and I went with Uncle Hershel's plate, came with eggs, meat side and biscuits and gravy.  So strange, our b&g were served separately and with gravy on the side as well.  I was looking for it to be drenched with gravy.  Anyhow, decent food, nice service, some peg game to play while you wait for your food.  Oh! I did like the flavored iced tea...a squeeze of lemon, it was perfect.  I must say, prices were decent, good for traveling families.  

Id try them again if there was one nearby where I live.  I would try breakfast...maybe pancakes or waffles.  Worth a try at least once if you get a chance."}
{"text":"I was impressed with how good the service was. Wasn't expecting it, food was good. My opinion has changed about Cracker Barrel. Will return"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is consistently delicious & comforting. Breakfast is always my first choice here. You can't beat it. And I love the old fashioned decor. One of my fav places to eat."}
{"text":"We love coming here. We don't get to very often but when we do it's always nice. We've only had breakfast here 4 or 5 times, but we would go back any time. The food is always good and the service is always above and beyond expectations. Love the atmosphere and although it's always slammed and packed is worth it. The portion sizes are large, and you will never leave hungry. Love the little gift shop with all the neat things to look at. We always talk about buying little things but seen to forget after we are so full."}
{"text":"Was here for breakfast for the first time in years. No reason why, just a lot of other places to visit. Place was crazy busy like usual but they do seat quickly. Shopping in the store is always fun!"}
{"text":"There is good and bad about this restaurant. The good is that while you wait, there is a really awesome store to go through and shop. The bad news is that they are really busy during breakfast. This really shows in the waitressing. I have been to this place over 20 times and I have never gotten great service. Also, every time I order bacon, I have to send it back. This is after I warn them about making sure that it is almost burned. I still go back though because it is pretty decent food and because it is a fun restaurant to visit with your family."}
{"text":"This is a tough one to rate. I've been to a Cracker Barrel before and it was alright dining in.  

This time I decided to get a meal to go, since i was traveling alone, and my hotel room was ready with the a/c cranked up full blast I figured i'd just be comfortable and have my meal elsewhere.   I called ahead after reviewing the menu and I  asked if there were any specials, I was informed that the special of the day was a turkey dinner.  I thought about it and after looking at other options, decided to go with it.  The lady on the phone was polite and easy to understand and I was told that my meal would be ready in 5 minutes.  Luckily i was just on the other side of the shopping center and was there in 5 minutes.   The meal wasn't ready so I wandered around the gift shop part of the restaurant for about 15 minutes admiring the Christmas items for sale.. It's only September (too soon in my opinion)  

The person that brought out the food in a to go bag double checked the order item for item and it was correct.  I headed back to my hotel and laid out the items: corn bread stuffing, turkey, cranberry dressing,  corn bread and biscuit with apple butter,   mac   n cheese.  With all the items in their respective containers and sitting on my table the meal somehow lost its sparkle.  having a large plate with just a couple pieces of turkey, gravy and cranberry dressing just looked depressing, but if it all the items were together it would just be a mushy mess by the time i got to it. I picked through the different items, the cornbread dressing was good, the turkey was just OK,. the cranberry dressing was pretty tasty, the gravy tasted like something from the store, the mac n cheese was lacking flavor, the apple butter was good, but I wasn't sure where to put it so it ended up on one of the rolls.  

Overall i guess the experience was alright, and a meal for $10 isn't bad.  I'd probably go somewhere else given any options."}
{"text":"I tried this the other day with my hubby and a friend. I was not impressed. I had heard that this place, in other states, will get lines around the block of people waiting to get in and the only reason I can think of is that it's cheap. The food is just okay even for the cheap prices. I had a breakfast entree consisting of chicken fried chicken, eggs, biscuits, gravy, grits and hash brown casserole. The chicken was not bad. The eggs were cooked as ordered. The grits were bland and runny. The biscuit had no flavor and the gravy was thin and tasted canned. The hash brown casserole was all onion, you couldn't taste anything but. Our waiter was great and even what I assumed was a manager, came by to check on us. So the service was good. The country store is cute, as is the rest of the decor, however I won't be back to eat. There are just to many options in Vegas for comfort food that are much better."}
{"text":"There are only two reasons i would return to Arizona. 
1. To visit my cousin!! 
2. Momma's French Toast Breakfast 

OMG...this place is to die for! 

I came here for breakfast and ordered the Mommas French Toast. Seriously the best french toast I have ever had...even...SHHH don't tell grandma...but yes better than my grandmas! 
They use sourdough toast to make the french toast and omg just so good. I'm just sad they don't have them in California. 

Service was Excellent.. I think her name was Yesenia ...but yeah she was awesome! Our coffee and Ice tea was full at all times!! 

I am already planning my trip in December and Cracker Barrel is definitely one of my stops on my way!"}
{"text":"Good Ol Comfort Food. I like their breakfast better than dinner selections. One exception, Sunday night dinner special, fried chicken. Best I ever had."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant to go in Champaign, and if something particularly good happens to me, this is where we go to celebrate.  You have to order carefully, it is true.  The pork barbecue is good, the rainbow trout is pretty good if not fried, but the main reason to go is the GREENS.  They have flecks of meat in them which is what makes them good.  This is the reason that i like southern cooking.  The biscuits and cornbread are also very good.  I would avoid all other of their meat entrees, particularly their meatloaf which has a really weirdly fluffy and light consistency, as if meat had been aerated and transformed into a different substance with different properties, and the \"chicken n noodles,\" which is like condensed chicken soup from a can, but with extra slime.  Beef stew is a disaster; even the waitress described it as \"fatty.\"  

Desserts are insanely huge and can be shared if you are a family of 4.  Three of us all had a go at the apple dumpling and barely made a dent in it. It went back looking more or less the same as when it arrived.  The thing I like the most about this place is its multicultural democratic bent. Despite the downhome theme of this place, which might seem off-putting if you are not a white person from the midwest, I have always had excellent service here.  It is also the only restaurant in our town that I have seen that has both a white and a black clientele (I have never seen Asian people here, except for some people who were clearly part of a bus tour and therefore not there of their own free will)."}
{"text":"My daughter and i ended up here as a result of having to travel Easter weekend for Easter dinner. 

Our wait time was very reasonable . I think we only waited 5-10 minutes to be seated. 

Our server, Jamie, was great and very attentive from the start. Without being overbearing. 

I was a little disappointed that i could t try the southern girls because they were out of the hash browns. 

I ordered dinner and my daughter ordered breakfast and it was all delicious. 

We had the French toast breakfast and the country friend chicken and mashed potatoes. 

I was also disappointed that the cabbage had pork in it as i don't eat red meat. So i had to modify my menu selection again. 

We enjoyed our Easter dinner and it was truly as close to home cooked that we were gonna get. 

Because of the great service we weren't there longer than an hour and ready to get back on the road and head home!"}
{"text":"Nice that a Cracker Barrel opened not far from me. I've had no issue with waiting and been seated right away. That huge fireplace is great to sit near when it's colder outside and you can request to sit near it. I only eat breakfast here and the pancakes are good they have pure maple syrup to accompany them. If you like to eat meat like me the sunrise sampler is the way to go since you get bacon, sausage AND ham! The sampler also comes with eggs, hash brown casserole, grits, and biscuits with gravy. I don't like the grits but my wife does so she eats that. Their biscuits are bomb af and it was a nice touch when our server brought some complimentary at the beginning of the meal. Service and food has been good. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We are Cracker Barrel regulars wherever we travel in the USA, if there is a Cracker Barrel, we might stop in for a bite to eat! There are a few things you can count on.....ice cold air conditioning (even when you don't need it), which usually ends up cooling off my food before I am done eating. But on the plus side, we can count on a clean establishment at all Cracker Barrels and home cooking and a cozy homestyle atmosphere. We stayed overnight at a nearby hotel so this CB was our go-to place for dinner and returned at breakfast...so why only 2 stars? Well, at dinner one of us was served the wrong dinner, it was close enough to what he ordered, but not what he expected (he got chicken fried steak when he ordered chicken fried chicken which is his favorite) he is so nice he didn't send it back, he just ate it. We figured it had to be a fluke, so when we went back for breakfast 14 hours later we figured no chance for a repeat performance, but yet again at breakfast, another server delivered the wrong breakfast to one of us. So, sorry, your employees need more training guys! We will be back and we hope the girls are better at their jobs. We love this food. Oh, and one other thing, my all-time favorite thing is the side order of beans, my little bowl of beans amounted to about 2 tablespoons full of beans with no juice in them....hardly something I would be waiting to eat....At breakfast, my Uncle Hershel's platter had the toughest piece of country ham I have ever eaten, I could not eat it."}
{"text":"I expected to wait, no problem....after an hour and 10 minute wait, they called our party of 6 to be seated....a few of our party was at the bass pro shop, next door.  We told the hostess that part of our party would be right over and walking through the parking lot, currently.  We were told that none of us could be seated until the whole party was present.   They gave our table away and made us wait an additional 40 minutes until another table became available.   Furious!

After waiting such a long time, we were looking forward to the great service and yummy comfort food that we have had in the south in the past.  When we got our food, it was cold and bland!  There are so many other places that serve similar food around the Las Vegas area, with much better service and not the ridiculously long wait time.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place is freeway close, easy to get to. They just recently opened and are busy!  The wait was long for a weekday, but they try to get you seated quickly. The food was really good and they serve lots of comfort food.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just a little taste of home! 

Growing up with Cracker Barrel restaurants nearby, it was almost certain one meal during the month would be here.  I was happy one opened in the Vegas area.  The southern feel starts out with their 'front porch and rocking chairs.  The front of the restaurant serves as a gift shop full of treats reminiscent of the good old days.  

We walked up around 8 on a Sunday morning.  Luckily we didn't have any wait to be seated.  Being a new business to the area we weren't sure.  Fortunately good service prevailed during our breakfast.  Refills were abundant and done very politely.  

One thing I knew for sure was to order Mama's Pancake Breakfast. Why? For the Pecan Pancakes.  I have enjoyed them at various locations across the country and they have always satisfied.  Would you have guessed it? They were still great! They also offer sugar free syrup for crazy people like me.  

In addition to the pancakes, mama's is also served with two eggs and sausage how you want them.  It's really a complete breakfast for me.  

I enjoyed my trip down memory lane.  Ya'll check it out!"}
{"text":"News Flash!  Las Vegas has a Cracker Barrel! It's the first and only one on the West Coast!

So First Up!
CB is across from Silverton, on your right side coming from Dean Martin BLVD...just follow the signs. Make sure when you go in, find the hostess podium or there may be one right as you walk in, Leave your name and how many in your party.  They'll let you know how long the wait is. Make sure you are close by the speaker system so you can hear your name being called when your table is ready! 

Got two visits in, the first, on their grand opening day, the latter two weeks later.  Despite the wait times (1 1/2 hours and 45 min) Everyone seemed to be in a good mood. I killed time browsing thru the country store that was filled with boutiquey like stuff, kitchen goods, novelty foods and throwback candy. 

They have plenty of rocking chairs, fans overhead, two industrial electrical fans, a water cooler on the front \"porch\" to keep everyone as comfortable as much as they can while waiting,

Food
Just going to gloss over this part because not much to it.  I love Southern comfort- stick-to-your ribs and hips kinda food.  The biscuits are warm and fluffy, the corn muffins, buttery, chicken and dumplings, hearty, fried apples, yummy.  The open faced Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, was a disappointment. Not how Mr. B remembered having it when we dined in CB in AZ. The meat was tender, but they were skimpy on the gravy here.   

If you compare this place to Black Bear Diner (the West Coast version of down home cookin) you'll be disappointed in the portions and overall taste from here.  Cracker Barrel was more on the bland side.  

They also lack plating skills..lol...but that's just the foodtographer in me talking. Everything looked like it was just slung on your plate and moved down an assembly line. Nothing wrong with that, but my carrots looked lonely on that big plate.

Price
It's great!  Budget friendly. Young families, retirees on a budget, or travelers will appreciate this place more. That's what the clientele make up here was. 

Service
Our experience was awesome both visits.  ALL the staff were upbeat and confident! Our server and her helpers were pretty efficient. Despite how crazy busy it was, our drinks got refilled, plates cleared out, no long wait on orders on both visits. The line was long on both times when we went up to pay, but we got thru it pretty quickly. 

While we enjoyed the nostalgia and downhome aspect, for locals like me it's a one and done thing for now. It is a nice place to bond with fam and friends though, they 'll keep you occupied if your wait time is long!"}
{"text":"Usually a breakfast goer here, but today I decided to try lunch.. And I regret it. I ordered the half pound bacon cheese burger medium well with a side of steak fries and a root beer. The root beer was Stewart's brand straight from a fresh bottle (though it wasn't opened in front of me) served in a frosty mug. Love it... However things really too a ton when I got my burger.. It was beyond well done its was completely charred outside and had hardly any mayo. The steak fries were lukewarm and the  coleslaw (a side you have no choice on it comes with the burger)  was disgusting (I'm not a slaw fan myself but I do know what it should taste like)  the country atmosphere is honest and not super in your face or superficial (the waitresses aren't dressed up like cowgirls or any such nonsense) but if say stick to breakfast with these guys.. It's what they do best"}
{"text":"So excited that Cracker Barrel has opened. Had to wait about an hour but once we were seated our food was served quickly. Brian is one of the managers at another Cracker Barrel opening at North Las Vegas, super guy, stopped by twice to check on us to ensure we were enjoying our meal. Will be a frequent stop for our Vegas trips!"}
{"text":"Came in 30 min before close and got exceptional service and our food was delicious and fresh :) there chicken fried chicken was to die for"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sit down,affordable, soul food kinda place. So so good. Chicken friend chicken is so yummy with some slow cooked greens beans and mashed potatoes.  I cant even...."}
{"text":"First time at a cracker barrel and have always heard great things about it. Went to opening day at this Vegas location since I was there on vacation for my birthday and all I have to say is AMAZING!

When you first walk up you see 2 long rows of rocking chairs on the front porch to sit at while you wait and is so inviting and homey feeling. When you walk in it takes you to the store where you can purchase items and check in to the restaurant. Since it was opening when I went yesterday it was busy BUT worth the wait. They said about an hour wait but only waited 30 minutes so in the waiting time I rocked my way on the front porch until they called our name. 

When I got to restaurant portion it was so neat with country feel and signs and decor everywhere. They serve breakfast all day but I had dinner since it was dinner time. I got their grilled marinated chicken tenderloins with 3 sides that you get pick from a nice list to choose from. My three sides I picked were Mac n cheese, broccoli and mixed green salad and some biscuits. It was delicious!!!! Portion sizes are perfect size and the prices are good as well. I even caved and got a peach cobbler for dessert. For my drink I had a raspberry lemonade and it was so good it was like candy.

Our waitress was pleasant and so was the staff. The manager came by to check how we were doing and our experience. All the staff were friendly and came by to help. Over all the experience was AMAZING and they did a wonderful job for opening day. Keep it up and can't wait for one to come to California!!"}
{"text":"I found this establisment outstandingly subpar. As i always review, i ordered the cheeseburger with bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonaise, and ketchup, with a side of fries. As my order arrived, i noticed a plate with little to offer. As i examined the burger i noticed a few things; the bun was flat and soggy, as was the lettuce, the cheese was astoundingly cheap, and lackluster in taste. Their \"thick cut\" bacon was almost a half millimeter thick, and the fries were extremely oversalted. The burger and fries were extremely disappointing, though the service was great. All in all, crackerbarrel is nothing to get excited about, and was quite a letdown."}
{"text":"First time here.. awesome service, no wait and the food was good. Nothing crazy but it was good. And the store was super cute!!"}
{"text":"I've only had one bad time at Cracker Barrel out of the hundreds of times I've been there, for breakfast/lunch or dinner. Even the day my friend and I dealt with the awful experience, they rectified it promptly.  I will always be a loyal Cracker Barrel patron :) They have a great amount of options, the price is great, and typically fast service at this and other locations."}
{"text":"I've been a Cracker Barrel fan since my time in Florida, so I was excited about the new store opening here in town.

We went early today around 7am and just made it before the mad Saturday morning rush.  Our waiter, David, was a very nice guy who made sure we had refills and were taken care of.  I ordered the Momma's French Toast breakfast, which was good, although it says topping of your choosing, but you're limited on fruit toppings (blackberry, apple, and peach).  

There was an issue when paying, they charged me extra for my meal when the extra charge (Turkey Bacon) was supposed to be included with the meal, but they fixed it for me.   Not sure if they did that because it was busy and just opened, and it was only a few dollars, but I know I was right.

Didn't have a chance to peruse the store area, but it looked like it had all the classics: old school candies, merchandise, everything you'd normally find there.

Overall, it was a good experience.  I'll go back when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"We loved the ribeyes at the Cracker Barrels back in Ohio, and we had some time today to check out this location at Craig and I15. Service? Outstanding. Food quality? Mediocre at best :( My husband's order included an order of turkey sausage, which he found inedible. He told the server when she asked about things. She didn't know what to do with a complaint. She just took it away. Didn't apologize. Didn't get a manager. A mgr-type did stop and asked how things were. He even prodded my husband who wasn't going to mention it again. So he told this person that the quality was lacking and that he couldn't eat it. He was like \"oh ok\" and walked away. Totally incapable of resolving the situation to turn things toward the positive. So we paid $3.29 and never plan to return. My steak was wayyy over-seasoned with salt. Hash brown casserole was bland. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I am from Ga  I have been going to Cracker Barrel across the country since they opened. I was so excited when I heard they were coming to Vegas . Yesterday was our third and last visit to this location. My husband and I both were extremely disappointed in our food. Terrible mashed potatoes (like glue) the okra was horrible. I know my meatloaf was Day old and reheated. The coleslaw was really nasty! The sweet tea was sooo sweet I couldn't drink it! We go to St George and it's great . No excuse for lousy food!"}
{"text":"Was seated in back room and never served as an African American it looked suspicious.  I left after a white family came in and was immediately served"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I love cracker barrel.  That said this was my first visit to the new cracker barrel in Las Vegas.  It will be my only vist.  While the wait time was long, I expected that.  It was fine.  It's what happened from the time we were called up to be seated that things went downhill.  My wife asked for a gluten free menu.  They didn't have one (despite every other one we've been to having one).  So she looked it up online and we moved on.  We ordered drinks and then shortly our food.  We thought things were going fine.  Alas...45 minutes later...no food...no check backs to offer to refill our drinks (even the manager who was table touching at every table skipped over ours...presumably he didn't want to actually be told anything was lacking...or he's blind).  So then our food comes.  My wife ordered her dressing on the side of her grilled chicken salad....only to be told it was already tossed in.  I didn't get the biscuits or muffins that came with my meal. I'd have complained...but at this point god knows how long that would have taken.  At this point, between the long wait and the slow crappy service...next time we'll go to the one in Utah or Arizona...it'll be faster and better service."}
{"text":"Absolutely ZERO improvements since the last review. Service is still poor, wait times are off the chart. orders are constantly screwed up. Take out orders are not even started until you get there to pick them up. Food is served cold, portions are small.Trying to get a beverage refilled is like asking for a free ride to Chicago.Noise level inside the dining area is deafening.You have to yell across your table.There are people PICKETING outside the business about a labor dispute.When we asked a employee about it she said she is not allowed to talk about it.The manager on duty will stop by and ask you \"hows things are going\". When you tell them you are not happy, they too disappear like the servers, never to be seen again.If they offer any kind of compensation it will be a free drink.It's become apparent that this is indeed the business model for this location. We feel there will not be any improvements. Why should there be? The place is packed with tourists.Were done with this place, you win. We have taken our dining business to other eateries"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, great service- Courtney was wonderful! Food great too! Thank you! Don't live in this state but would've back if we did"}
{"text":"***Cracker Barrel is a countrified Denny's, but the food is better than that chain and their lack of presence on the West Coast makes their Arizona location feel different and more unique than some of the other big chains you'll find there***

When I was a kid, I used to eat at Cracker Barrel a lot (Cracker Barrel is a combination of a touristy general store and a countrified restaurant focusing on big breakfasts and home-style lunches/dinners).  Cracker Barrel is very popular in the Midwest and it is also a popular along-the-highway-stop in the Southeast.  I remember enjoying it, but my fondness for it has decreased over the years.

Every Cracker Barrel looks the same.  They have a faux rustic outdoor cabin-like exterior with a faux porch lined with rocking chairs that you can purchase.  When you enter, you are immediately in a pseudo general store that offers touristy souvenirs and a lot of food items.  Not really pantry items.  Instead, you will find a lot of sweets like nostalgic candy, chocolates, caramels, syrups, jams, apple butters, candy sticks (15 cents per stick), Jelly Belly jelly beans, etc.

Just past the general store you will find the restaurant.  The breakfast (which I believe is served all day) is a mix of your standard stuff like pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits, etc.  Bob Evans is a lot like Cracker Barrel and I think Bob Evans' breakfast is far superior.

I went with a dish I have always ordered--chicken and dumplings with mashed potatoes and corn niblets.  The last time I had this dish was in Ohio and the dish was quite oily and bland.  The dish was still on the bland side though the dumplings/sauce were less oily (there was a much creamier base).

The dumplings were a little bit too thin, but they were mostly fine and enjoyable.  The chicken was a relatively small portion and it was a little dry (but not too bad).  The chicken and dumplings could have definitely used a lot more seasoning (though places like Cracker Barrel tend to have to please an older clientele, who may have more sodium restrictions).

The mashed potatoes were okay.  Not the creamiest or smoothest texture.  Very hot.  The corn was okay.

I had the hot fudge sundae for dessert and it was not that bad of a deal (it was under $3).  Served in a frozen mug, the sundae consisted of two scoops of Blue Bell vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry.  The whipped cream was of the canned/aerosol variety, but the ice cream was decent.  It had a good flavor and was firm and creamy.  It was also not too whipped or airy (which you get at a lot of family restaurants).

The hot fudge was also good and warm.

Service was fine.  It was pleasant and quick.  I do not think I would classify Cracker Barrel as authentic country cuisine, but they definitely achieve a consistent look and personality with all their waitresses (no matter what state you are in).

Pricing is more than reasonable.  You get a lot of food and you do not have to pay much.  Most of their entrees are below $10 and desserts run about $4 and below.

You could probably do worse than Cracker Barrel on the road.  Still, I think the food was pretty average at best.  But if you find yourself needing to stop somewhere on the road in Arizona, you will come across a lot of chains you can find in California.  Cracker Barrel is a big chain too, but their lack of presence on the West Coast at least makes this restaurant feel somewhat different and unique.

This Cracker Barrel is in a seemingly new shopping development that has a huge and free parking lot."}
{"text":"Serving staff is horrible.  At this location off of the 101 and Bell.

Arrived and got seated right away, sat at my table for 15 min.  Place wasn't too visibly busy for a Saturday afternoon.  Our server walked past our table 6 times.  I had to go the seating person who our server was.  When they came by they said they where going to go set a tray down.  Waited an additional 10 minutes.  At which point I decided to leave.  I asked for the manager and I expressed my frustration about it.  He didn't try to fix it, he just nodded and said sorry."}
{"text":"Typically love this place.  I have been coming here for 10 years.  Probably two times a week.  Just recently on our last two visits we noticed a terrible taste in their water. The ice tea is obviously uses the same water source.  It tastes like \"lake water\".   My daughter first noticed it, then me.  My husband thought we were nuts. Then he tasted it.  None of us could drink our water or ice tea.   I reported it to the manager, and he said he would check the filtration system.  We came back tonight, about a week later and you can still taste it in the water and tea."}
{"text":"So I gave it try again after quite some time. The last trip was less than fun. Just couldn't resist those pancakes. Wow what a turn around from my last visit!  I was seated straight away and water on the table within a minute. Cynthia waited on me and was very friendly and attentive. My food was out in minutes. Great job by all. Thanks for the great experience."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. There pancakes are huge but it's very filling. I would recommend his place to anyone for a good big breakfast."}
{"text":"Came here for Breakfast while in Vegas. Great food, good price, great atmosphere. A nice change from the Strip vibe. Pretty cool Country store as well"}
{"text":"I have only had Cracker Barrel in Louisiana prior to this location. I loved it in Louisiana but will never eat  it again in Vegas. Coffee was watered down. Biscuits were not even browned. French toast was basically sourdough with maple syrup. All of the meats were dry and tough. Honestly almost inedible."}
{"text":"We called in for a take out order and we're told that it would take 20 minutes. It took my husband more than 20 minutes to find parking. Once he was able to find parking, he was told that our order wouldn't be ready for another 40 minutes. So he told them to cancel the entire order. We thought we would give this place a try since we are locals. We don't recall another place not having assigned parking for take outs. Never again!"}
{"text":"In the grand scheme of things, I have only recently discovered Cracker Barrel in the past couple of years.  I visited my first and only in Utah.  I had heard many tales of Barrel of Crackers.  With each story, I could not wait to visit, hoping everything positive I had heard was true.  It met my expectations.

Now the franchise has moved into several locations in the Vegas valley.  This would be the first I would visit, when the GF's sister rolled into town.  She had never been to a Cracker Barrel Old Country Store (CBOCS).

It was a bit of a drive to reach CBOCS.  I did not mind because, if this relatively new location was anything like the one previous it would not disappoint.  Having properly orientated myself to the intersection of Craig & Losee, given that it was a Sunday during the hours most travelers are heading north, I also prepared myself for a crowd.

Pulling into the parking lot, there was some indication of a possible crowd.  No worries...I was prepared.

Hot was the wind that blew into my face like an oven as I took note of rocking chairs on display outside.  Just like another more northerly location.  Into the breech we went...leading into CBOCS version of a gift shop.  No line?  Immediately seated?!  Yes!!  Taken to a spot in the corner, the ambiance was everything I knew CBOCS to be.  There was one exception, that being enormity of the dining area.  This location can feed a bunch a people.

Our incredibly magnanimous server (who's name, sadly, I do not remember) made for an amazing down home dining experience!  Though there were times when my raspberry iced tea ran dry for awhile, when her bright and happy face arrived, all was forgiven.

I settled on a \"Maple Jam N' Bacon Burger.\"  According to the website, \"Two patties* topped with maple pepper bacon, Colby cheese, maple onion jam, and finished with lettuce and tomatoes\" (Retrieved from https://www.crackerbarrel.com/menu/lunch-and-dinner/country-sandwich-platters).  I took it with fries and a side of delicious cabbage with pork pieces in it.  Everything was delicious.

This CBOCS, was solid.  The service was four stars, and the food was absolutely a four star experience."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cracker Barrel since I was a kid.  Amazing that I've never written a review.  The location in the NW part of Mesa AZ is relatively to my house so I find myself there usually a few times a year to eat breakfast or as in my visit tonight breakfast for Dinner!  My go to is Mama's Pancake Breakfast which comes with three awesome pancakes, two eggs and bacon and sausage.  A ton of food for $8.29.  The star deduction is because my eggs were over cooked tonight, but I didn't complain as I was hungry and in a hurry.  My server Lauren was awesome, friendly, personable, great smile.  She noticed that my eggs were over cooked and insisted on bringing me new one's, but I wouldn't let her.  I genuinely appreciate her attention to detail, but again was in a hurry.  Great Place, fantastic gift shop, always a pleasure for me anyway, to dine here!  Management at this location seems pretty solid, and as a former restaurateur always catches my eye!"}
{"text":"I used to love cracker barrel. However this location is not the greatest. Went there this weekend and waited 40 mins to get a table. Then we waited another 10 minutes before we were even greeted by the waiter. The food was cold when we got it. We asked if we could sub out a side with a burger and the waiter laughed at us and said no. Had to ask 3 different people for ranch! Our table was right by the kitchen so I am not sure how it was forgotten so easily. Also my meal came with biscuits\or muffins... we never got those either. I usually don't complain but this is the worst service we have ever received."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great down home cooking and a fun store to shop in while you wait... what more could you ask for! Love this place and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Coming from out of town, I take every opportunity I can to come to this place. Showed up on a Monday morning, and the wait seemed fairly long for a late morning. Took about 20 minutes to seat 2. Waitress was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and was on top of everything. It's always worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I came for breakfast around noon on a Saturday and were happy to hear there was no wait time. We were quickly seated. Our waitress took our drink and food orders within 5 minutes and was friendly and prompt. We were served coffee however; 40 minutes later we were still waiting for food. Our waitress stopped by our table twice apologizing for the wait and even brought biscuits the second visit. She told us to complain to the manager later if we wanted. But then... we waited another 15-20 minutes for food that never came. So after wasting an hour of our Saturday we walked out, with nobody to even ask if everything was okay. Goodbye Cracker Barrel forever ! Dramatic but true. How hard is it to fry a couple eggs. I would have given 0 stars but Yelp won't let me post without at least 1"}
{"text":"Service was fun the store was cute This is a great place to stop in and eat when you're out of town and away from home great cooking all the time and pretty consistent the catfish single piece with two sides for 799 is great if you need a little bit more there's a three side to piece catfish for 1049 all-around good 

the server was great his.name was  Daniel young man kept my drink full and had a great positive attitude.  Had a great food experience.  Nice"}
{"text":"I purchase the Mama's Breakfast which is my favorite however this time I sent it true that the regular pancakes with blueberry pancakes. Needless to say I do not like the blueberry pancakes it doesn't have any flavor although I love the fact that each pancake hat a lot of blueberries in them however the flavor of the pancake itself needed some work. And one thing I I love about Cracker Barrel's is their pancakes they are the best hands down however this one not so much."}

There were 2 people at the registers who resolved it for us. We love you guys and hope this never happens to us again when we eat with you. Thanks, Carolyn Keegan"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Robinson Town Centre!

A thousand times better then the nearby IHOP! We have been to a few different Cracker Barrels while traveling on the Turnpike. This location is pretty much just like all of the other locations. I just wish there was a separate door to bypass the gift shop as it is always packed and hard to navigate through to get to the actual restaurant.

I have tried quite a few different items on the breakfast menu of the years but my favorite has to be Uncle Herschel's Favorite. It's my favorite as well. It comes with two eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, buttermilk biscuits, fried apples or hashbrown casserole and your choice of country ham, a grilled pork chop, sugar cured ham or a fried chicken tenderloin.  I usually go with grits, biscuits and gravy, hashbrown casserole, a grilled pork chop and I substitute the eggs for buttermilk pancakes as I don't like of eat eggs.

The pancakes are soft and fluffy, same goes for the biscuits, the gravy is delicious,  the hashbrown casserole is out of this world and the grilled pork chop is cooked and seasoned to perfection.

Service is always good and we always leave stuffed and filled to capacity. After we eat we look around the gift shop for a while as you never know what kind of little trinkets you will find.

Then we usually then go over to either IKEA or the nearby Giant Eagle Market District to walk off our food comas.

If you're ever in the area this place is a must stop!"}
{"text":"Server was irritated that we were there, she must've had other things to do. She was slow and rude. Dropped our food and never came back. Flagged others down for more coffee and water. Also had to wave her down to ask for check. Service not good, food mediocre. Hash brown casserole is gross."}
{"text":"I've gotta say....when I want to splurge on breakfast, i love cracker barrel...and they always have the happiest service   consistent and they do a great job."}
{"text":"My mother in law has been raving about CB forever and had to try it.  We came for breakfast on a Sunday morning.   Check in is at the front outside and it looks like a porch with rocking chairs that are for sale.  It was busy and wait was 30 mins but we got in about 20 mins.  You walk through the country store before the dining room so it was packed.  The dining room is cutely decorated.  Tables are neatly placed but very close to one another.  You can reach over and touch the person next to you.  

Service is on point and we never had to wait very long for anything.  We got our food within 10-12 mins.  I ordered the country boy breakfast with steak that included a sample of everything.  Hubs ordered french toast.  Very tasty well seasoned steak although a bit tough but for $12 didn't expect high grade. BEST hash browns that have cheese mixed in. Good grits and apples.  French toast was also the best.  You can taste how much egg is inside.

You pay for your meal in the store and you can add your purchases to it.  The store is surprisingly very reasonably priced.  We spent about $50 in there.  

We enjoyed it here so much that we came for lunch the next day.  Lunch was not as good.  The corn bread was so dry and hard it was not edible.  My chicken strips were on par with Denny's so it tasted like frozen.  

I still give it 5 stars because there is so much I Love about CB.  I would not hesitate to go again.  They different than anything in its class (breakfast places) that I enjoy the nuances."}
{"text":"The only thing good with this store is the ambiance.  The steak was tough and stringly, utensils are dirty and hard water stains on all of them.  The service is average, not good but not so bad either.  Food is ok.  I regretted going here.  There were other breakfast place I could have gone to with much more better quality of food and service.  I guess it satisfy the curiosity of these place, but never again.  Hope it helps other Yelpers.  You will not miss anything by not coming here.  I wonder why this place is packed all the time???  Nothing good to offer for repeat customers."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was quick for how busy it was. Only complaint is the women who cashed us out was rude. No \"have a nice day\" or \"thanks for coming\" she ended our conversation by saying \"here you go\" and handing us the receipt."}
{"text":"***Cracker Barrel, a popular country kitchen restaurant chain in the Midwest and the South, now has a location just off The Strip; the food varies from okay to satisfying, but the portions are incredibly generous***

Las Vegas has brought in many big brands and chains recently.  There is a White Castle now.  A Shake Shack.  Now, there is a Cracker Barrel, which is located just off The Strip next to the Silverton casino and hotel.  Cracker Barrel is a chain business that features a restaurant and a faux general store selling dry goods provisions and seasonal items.

The general store offers several items that are probably a waste of money (or at the very least, just items you probably do not need).  The general store though makes the potential long waits you may experience at Cracker Barrel more tolerable.  It also does feature a few fun things like a variety of packaged snacks and sweets, which includes some hard to find and nostalgic candy options.  Cracker Barrel always features seasonal decorations.

The restaurant at Cracker Barrel offers great value.  You can get breakfast all day.  Lunch and dinner are also served.  Most of their lunch and dinner options are in the $9 to $14 range and feature very generous portions.

I had the chicken n' dumplins platter.  The portion of chicken n' dumplins was very generous--lots of chicken breast meat and a fair amount of dumplins.  The chicken breast was fairly good for chain restaurant chicken (it was not too dry).  The dumplins were good.  They had a good chicken noodle quality even if the dumplins themselves were a little doughy.  Unfortunately, the chicken n' dumplins as well as the standard offering of mashed potatoes and gravy were both lukewarm in temperature.

The platter came with 2 additional sides.  I had the turnip greens with ham hock.  The ham hock was a tad salty while the greens were quite bitter (even more bitter than I was expecting).  The fried okra was decent.  There was definitely quite a bit of fried batter so you kind of lose the okra flavor.  The platter was finished with 2 mini cornbread muffins.  They were quite crisp on the outside.  I wish they were a tad sweeter.

Service was very friendly and quick.  Prices are good as they are not too expensive and you get very generous portions.

In terms of décor, Cracker Barrel has a faux old timey look.

Cracker Barrel is not a bad option for large families looking for a lunch or dinner before they get to The Strip or after leaving The Strip.

Cracker Barrel offers free self parking.  The lot is big and it is easy finding and open space."}
{"text":"Cracker barrel is definitely one of a kind. I want to always be able to bring my son for a Sunday breakfast or any time I need some good Ole country cookin.  Fish fry Friday is great, the lighter menu chicken is great, the yogurt parfait, breakfast... pretty much everything."}
{"text":"I really love the fact that they have no gender neutral bathrooms here. I also quite  fond of the food, especially breakfast, lunch and dinner. But I really, really love the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite places to eat when I travel, I had to give this location a bad writeup as they did not have vegetables ready in the AM and when I returned my steak to the kitchen to be replaced the manager came out and put me on trial.  I have met many cracker barrel managers and you would expect them to come out and say they are sorry that you had to send something back, no not this manager.  Got my steak, but after about 7 minutes of talking about the issue and why I felt this was not something I was going to eat.  Besides that great place to visit and the food is good.  Love the staff in general minus the one manager."}
{"text":"This location is inconsistent. Sometimes great and prefect like the reason why I like Cracker Barrel. Other times, horrible and the reason why I only go to Cracker Barrel when travelling. Mostly, this place is in the middle not really good and bad. 

Thus, to pricey for breakfast to get decent or bad food. Too disappointed at dinner when the miss so often...."}
{"text":"We drove here (five hours) just so I could try the white berry and white chocolate french toast, which is only at Cracker Barrel through the holidays.  Unfortunately, since this is a new Cracker Barrel, they don't serve it (or other things on their Seasonal menu), and likely won't.  If I had known this, I would have asked my friend to go to one of the Arizona Cracker Barrels, instead.

Since we had driven five hours just to eat at CB, we decided to stay, because, after all, there is no CB in California, so it was sort of a treat.  I ordered the chicken 'n dumplings.  They (like the rest of my food) were good, but not great.  The service, however, was awesome.  Our server, Stacy, was friendly, and either she, one of the bussers, or the manager would stop by and ask how our food was or to refill our drinks.  My only complaint service-wise was that we were never asked if we wanted dessert, or anything else.  I wanted to take a piece of chocolate Coke cake home with me, but we were never given the chance to ask for it, so I didn't bother bringing it to her attention.

Would probably stop here again if driving through Vegas... but if we're actually staying here, I wouldn't go out of my way and would likely just stick to eating on The Strip."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waited over 10 min for water and coffee despite two separate servers asking if we had been helped yet."}
{"text":"my family and I went last Sunday, 8-15-15 with a party of 11 at approximately 8:15 pm. My son arrived first and told the hostess that there was a party of 11 coming in about 15 minutes so they had time to get set up. I arrived around 10 minutes later and was thankful that they were not busy so a big party would not be a problem. We checked in and told the hostess the party was complete. They have a nice store you can browse in so we shopped and looked around for about 15 minutes or so. I thought it was strange that we were not seated so I walked out into the restaurant to see if maybe they were busier than I thought- they were not- empty table everywhere- ones that could be simply pushed together so that we could be seated. I approached the hostess and asked her how much longer and in a snooty attitude I was told that \"we have to arrange the tables\". Heck,  I could have pushed them together when I walked through as it would only take a few minutes. Another 5 minute wait and we were finally seated.  No personality or sorry to make you wait from miss snooty so we get to the table and begin to seat and she talked into her ear microphone that \"she's working on the party of 11 now\" with a worse attitude. I said that's enough of this and told her we were leaving and asked to see the manager- I explained the horrible service and he said he'd talk to the hostess- pretty much that was it.  What is customer service coming to?  A party of 11 would have been a nice size check for them and no one seems to care- unbelievable!  We went to in and out on 83rd and bell and got a good meal with good service. So if you decide to try this place be prepared- they could care less about your business."}
{"text":"Worst Cracker Barrel I have ever been to.

Tried to order on the phone - got put on hold by two different people then got hung up on. 
This is usually a bad sign, but I went in anyway, to place an order to go.  20 min later the manager, after dealing with someone else's complaint, realizes that there's no way my order wasn't ready by that point.  I poked my head into the dining room and there is one customer there.  All the waiters are shouting to each other while cleaning up after their shift.  My waiter was too busy talking and forgot to place my order despite the empty restaurant.  The manager took half off my meal and I waited another 10-15 minutes.  

The staff is in their own world - they all knew I was waiting for a to-go order and no one checked up on it; waiters are too eager to check out.  Manager didn't even offer to buy my 8$ meal."}
{"text":"Though it's a great distance location for a stop from to tucson to Cali. I wouldn't stop here again.

Food wasn't too good. The best thing we ordered was the parfait. 

Biscuits & gravy... The biscuits were so hard.  Not worth ordering.

Eggs, scrambled were way over cooked & rubbery. 

Bacon was ok not amazing but not terrible.

Customer servers were awkward & slightly annoying. Standing close & Listening into our conversation that has nothing to do with food.  

I went into bathroom. Hostess looks at me like I am stealing something. Shortly after a worker stands in the bathroom to \"check\" on me. I felt every unwelcomed here.  

Also, Homeless guy sobbing in front of restaurant."}
{"text":"Waited an hour after being told we had a 15 minute wait. Given the wrong drink order, had to ask every time for a refill, they then ran out of the drink and our food took 45 minutes. The girls seating people had an attitude problem.  Highly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere, which is casual and homey.  Food is good along with the service.  I like and would recommend the chicken fried steak."}
{"text":"Not sure what is with the bad reviews below but our first time here and the food was fantastic!

Our serve GeeGee I believe was her name was wonderful, she checked on us through out the meal and even refilled our drinks without having to be asked and gave us to go drinks!

I had the sampler platter of Meatloaf, chicken and dumplins and honey ham---wonderful, LARGE portions and it makes you think of Grandmas house where you never leave hungry.

The restaurant was clean as well and we wanted to buy some Blackberry Jam at the little store but they were out, the waiter ran into the restaurant and got us some small samplers to take home, wow!

I wish they had booths though but you cant have everything!

Planning to return for breakfast tomorrow!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with a little Cracker Barrel. I got the chicken fried steak and it was great. My friend had the pecan pancakes and I don't really like pecans.. But they were tasty!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite stops on the way to Utah...first time at this location and it is very noisy...full room of very loud people. While we wait for our order I shop...good for me...Steve looked shell shocked when I got back to the table. Next stop St George...don't know if I will get him to stop...his hearing might have returned by then"}
{"text":"NUMMMY!!! The best breakfast in town, great service, ambiance and shopping! 
May be bad for your diet, but aren't most things so delicious!?"}
{"text":"Love the food, could do without the crowd. I like it that a spot can be reserved online. Cracker Barrel should definitely think about opening a few more places nearby."}
{"text":"Terrible service. In fact, no service at all. I was seated this morning, then sat at my table for about six minutes without ever seeing a waiter. Eventually I just got up and left. It wasn't even busy."}
{"text":"The corn was bad, country fried steak was not very good. The white gravy was cold and nasty. The chicken was good. The pancakes were good. The service wasn't bad. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Went in today for a late lunch. Bella was our server she was great. I had lunch salad and potato special (I got French fries). Great special for 5.99 house salad was big and tasty with grilled chicken and bacon. Balsamic vinaigrette is so good. We also order Turkey dinner special and kids Mac and cheese. Both yummy and a great value. Only down side no drinks refill and had to wait for Togo box. Don't forget to stop at the Country Store on your way out!"}
{"text":"Boyfriends baseball team waited 2 hours to watch tables sit around after eating. 

Absolutely nothing going right here. They placed their name down at 1130 then they say it will be ready in 10, then again in 30, then again in an hour, then 2 hours, that's enough. Sure, they shouldn't have waited that long before leaving but because Cracker Barrel is GREEDY, they kept giving them hope that they will be seated. 

I feel bad for everyone who has to wait because they cannot run a restaurant correctly. 

Wasn't able to try their food. Aware of long lines. Also aware that I will never visit this restaurant due to the monkey team running it."}
{"text":"Always a congested place but great place to eat. There was at least a 25 minute wait for a Sunday lunch. Rocking chairs run alongside the porch for people to bask in the sun and shade. A retail store of trinkets and the sorts was a good way to keep the kiddos occupied, as well as adults. They have a breakfast menu plus a lunch and dinner menu. I decided to go with the breakfast healthy plate of egg beaters, turkey bacon, a side of fruit and cheese and grits. Just enough for me since I know I'm saving for dessert and some Starbucks concoction. 

Lunch time was so busy that there were no high chairs. However they did have booster seats. The cleanliness of the entire restaurant was mediocre. Could've been some improvement that goes for being super busy. It's a little bit too loud to have a conversation unless you're by the window or a corner."}
{"text":"I was BEYOND excited for this location to open. I have the fondest memories of Cracker Barrel from my family's cross-country trips. Couldn't wait to have breakfast with my dad and reminisce. 

It being opening week, I knew it would be a LONG, CROWDED wait!! Came prepared for that. What I was not prepared for was (once we were seated)

1. Waiting 25 min JUST for our coffees 
2. Having the kitchen tell us they are OUT OF GRITS....AFTER our food was brought out!!! That's 80% of the reason we chose Cracker Barrel for breakfast. Those grits are amazing and I CANNOT eat biscuits, gravy, casserole, etc due to food allergies. Maaaaany others in the restaurant were pissed as well. Manager came an apologized, but too little too late. 
3. Getting our side orders of food AFTER we got our bill...what? Server was completely confused the entire time.

I'm really hoping to amend my review next time I come. I'll chalk it up to opening jitters this time."}
{"text":"I have been to many cracker barrel restaurants across the country and I will say I am let down by this Las Vegas one. There are far too many tables and not enough servers to make the establishment run right. Not only that but the quality of food compared to the standard of CB is 'meh' at this location. The only reason I give this as many stars as I do is because I never have trouble with wait times."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of Cracker Barrel's over the years and this one is just like every other country style store/restaurant,it was fairly clean,extremely fast service,and friendly staff. I was especially happy because I found a couple DVDs of old 60's/70's shows that I had been looking for and even though they were a little bit more expensive then what they should have been I was still glad to have found them. All in all our experience was good at yet another Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"A great spot to grab breakfast... very crowded on a Sunday, despite the throngs of people, the staff was still very upbeat and nice... had to get the Uncle Hershel's favorite so I could cover all the important \"bad for you\" breakfast items: grits, biscuits and gravy!  Once we were seated, it was still very crowded - but our server did an excellent job!  My coffee and water were never lower than half and she was very attentive and pleasant.  A solid restaurant, run by friendly people!"}
{"text":"I was sooooo EXCITED that Cracker Barrel had made its way to the valley. Since I grew up, this has been one of my all time favorite places to eat. 

Over the years, I've ONLY eaten breakfast here regardless of the time of day. Pecan pancakes, eggs, bacon, hash brown casserole....YUMMY!!!

I knew that by this being a new location, the wait would be long. Hopefully it slows down over time."}
{"text":"Great servers. Fair prices for good tasting food. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was excellent. Wait time to get seated- 1 hr. 50 min.  Can't believe we waited this long, but that shows how popular this restaurant is! Just a tip,  go to Bass pro or go to Silverton Casino while you wait."}
{"text":"Don't come here hungry! We waited an hour to be seated and 40 mins for our food to come out. Mind you since we had an hour to wait we looked at the menu while waiting so we knew what we wanted as soon as we were seated! So we still waited 40 mins for our meal. Because we waited so long for our food our food was cold when it came out . Just when you thought you were done waiting you have to wait in another line just to pay for your food.
I love Cracker Barrel and have never had this bad of an experience at any of the other locations. This was a 2 hour dining experience ! No thank you . Anyone reading this review plan ahead if you really must visit this location."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am visiting from California and when I found out there was a Cracker Barrel I was set for the rest of my trip. They have the best food ever! Great service is a huge plus! After eating here my favorite thing to do is shop the gift shop! They have Yankee candles, Sock monkeys and cute little nic naks! They also carry nostalgic candy . You can not go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke! The service is horrible. I tried placing a carry out order and sat on hold for 10 minutes. When I finally hung up and tried to call back, there was a busy signal for the next 20 minutes until I decided to give up. I will NEVER order or eat here again. I hope management sees this and does something to prevent this from happening to someone else."}
{"text":"The food was typical for a Cracker Barrel but Maureen the waitress was awesome. Every server could learn something about good service and doing it with a smile from her."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced.
Marsha our server was AWFUL!  I will
Never go to a Cracker Barrel ever!"}
{"text":"Great little chain store/restaurant to make you believe you are in 1940's pre World War 2 innocents. The place was clean and seated fast. The waitress was nice, helpful and had the order correct. The food was a 7.2 out of 10. Great cup coffee."}
{"text":"My husband and I have gone here a number of times even though the food and service were so-so.  It was just convenient for us but, after our last visit, we are done.  We were there around 2pm, it wasn't too busy.  We ordered drinks and eventually got them.  Then we ordered our lunch.  I asked for a side salad.  That never came.  We drank what we had and wanted more.  Servers came around and served every table around us but refused to even look at us.  My meal came, salad never did, and the mashed potatoes were dead cold as was the gravy.  Up side, meat was hot.  By now, I was irritated and put the plate to the side of the table.  STILL couldn't get service.  They just walked on by.  I finally went to the cashier and asked to speak to management.  I never did eat but they still charged my husband for his meal even though he never got a drink refill (even asking TWO servers for one) and they never brought him catsup.  HORRIBLE service.  Will not be going back...to ANY Cracker Barrel.  We're done."}
{"text":"I've always gone to the Cracker Barrel in the south. To my surprise I was driving into Vegas and see a sign for a new one here. AMAZING. You can tell they are still new and working out the kinks but overall the food was exactly as I remembered it. And my server Gaye was so funny and sweet. Thanks for curing a little bought of homesickness."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning and I am STILL full!! :-) Plenty of food for the price and they have AWESOME old school candy!  There were a million and 42 people there today and we were seated in good time. The service is always good...even if they refill my coffee just after I got it the way I like it with 16 sugars and 6 creamers!! 

Good service will make or break it for me and these folks are on top of their game. 

And I only had to kick one little old man outta one of the rocking chairs so I could have a turn! :-)"}
{"text":"This place could be great, heck it use to be. I like Cracker Barrel for the simplicity and the food is good as well as the price. But lately I don't know if its management or the cooks or both, but it's bad. Like super bad. So last time I was there on a Sunday and my friend ordered the home style chicken which is really good and I ordered some seasonal 3 piece chicken kinda of like the home style just not as much breading. So she then comes back like 5 mins later to inform me that they don't have the one that I ordered anymore, so I get it and I understand, would've been nice to know when I ordered but whatever. So I then say just give me the home style chicken as well. She says okay and about 20 mins later she brings my broccoli and bread. I'm missing my chicken and my Mac and cheese which proceeds to come out another 8 mins at this point. Oh yes I am timing at this point. Long and behold she brings my friend and I this breaded chicken that looks like a lightly breaded pork chop. I kindly explain the situation and why these aren't even close to what we ordered and here is the best part. She then goes on to tell me that the homestyle chicken has been sold out for a while and continues to say \"I'm sorry about that next time I'll make sure I'm listening\" never again. I wanted to not tip her but my friend is a much better person than I am. I won't be back for a while to say the least. In the past the manager use to walk around and check on customers without even asking for him, he remembered people and was very thoughtful. No idea who this new manager is or what they look like. Nope not a fan."}
{"text":"I do love Cracker Barrel's biscuits and gravy with bacon. Not only is it good, but it's also cheap. There was a line on 12pm on a Saturday, but my friend and I didn't wait long. Long enough to walk around and peruse the store. 

We were seated at a table right next to the hostess booth. Not ideal, but people tried not bumping into us. Like I said the place was packed, so we didn't really have much of a choice. Marilyn was our waitress. She was nice and quick. After we ordered it only took about 10 minutes to get our food. I ordered my usual, which was actually better than it normally is. Score for me! My friend ordered the \"vegetable\" plate. I put that in quotes because you can order mac and cheese, fried okra, and other sort of vegetables but not really vegetables. 

In the end, my bill came out to $5.02. Not shabby for an awesome brunch."}
{"text":"Took about a half hour to be seated, after being told only 20 minutes. 3 orders of pancakes and a salad took about a half hour to come out. When speaking to a manager, he said \"we've been backed up on food all day,\" and proceeded to mumble something additional under his breath. Very rude. As a manager, you don't speak to customers like that. I don't care if you are backed up. When there are people he came  in after you did leaving before you even get your food, clearly that's a problem."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of those places I have been eating at for many, many years, but unfortunately, I feel their quality is going down and their prices going up.  On our last visit, the service was as good as it gets - they get an A+ on service.  I ordered the 4 vegetable plate and substituted 2 veggies for a baked potato and a dinner salad.  One of the veggies was green beans - the bowl was not heaped high like it used to be - I ate the entire contents with two bites.  The potato came with butter and a packet of sour cream - no bacon, no chives, no cheese - this was a big change from the past and I felt like I was totally ripped off.  Wendy's has a sour cream and baked potato for a buck.  The salad was small and had lettuce, tomato and that's it.  No onion, etc or anything - plain.  My total bill for my plate was 12 dollars.  I won't be going back anytime soon, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. We've been a couple of times now that they've been open a little while and their service and food is wonderful. And their waiter Zachary that we had today is amazing"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch place! You can have breakfast at noon :)) beware, however, the quality of food and service decreases 10-fold at 1pm. Do not come here at 1pm!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast this morning and I was very disappointed got coffee as my drink had my first cup and waited about 15 minutes for another host/hostess to ask me if I wanted a refill my hostess never came around and asked me when I got my food I proceed to eat it and my hostess never asked how the food was but I could hear the other hostess asking ppl across from me how was everything and right before I left I asked my hostess for a to go box she said sure I will be right back with it I waited for 10 minutes for her to get me one she never showed up with one as soon as I was leaving I noticed my hostess had other ppls food that she was giving them and to top everything off my wife went to use the bathroom and to her surprise the toilets where disgusting thinking the IHOP what have probably been better place to eat and this will be the last time I ever eat at this Cracker Barrel location FYI Cracker Barrel train your host/hostess better."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. The cat fish is delicious too. You won't go wrong to pay this place a visit."}
{"text":"I love these restaurants in general but this one was subpar. I got meatloaf which was warm not hot. I also ordered a sweet potato and after 30 minutes of waiting was informed they were out unless I wanted to wait an extra 45 minutes. Green beans were very bland. Just not the experience I normally have at this great restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like homestyle cooked country food!!!? I'm so glad we decided to give this place a try Sunday for brunch! 

When we arrived there was a line going out the doors, but thankfully our party was already seated when we arrived. We sat down and the waitress came over quickly to take our drinks. The lemonade is so GOOD! It comes it you in a frozen mug and the flavor is just right! We had the option of the breakfast menu and or the lunch menu. I went with the lunch menu and decided to get the Sunday special. The Sunday special consisted of two pieces of boneless chicken breasts, mashed potatoes, steak fries, and a biscuit! The chicken pieces were huge and flavorful and the biscuits were hot and fluffy!!! The mashed potatoes were a little on the dry side (even with gravy) and the steak fries had no flavor. 

Our server was great and very friendly! Definitely coming back! It does tend to get VERY crowded in the gift store part of the store (you have to walk through here to get in or out) so beware of kids running around, people trying to shop, and people trying to get through you to get out of the store."}
{"text":"Beautiful store, bad food.  Our kids mac n cheese was burnt. My steak was cold almost frozen in the middle. Very odd for being \"well done\". The food was not well seasoned and very plain. My worst experience of this chain.  I go twice a year to Arizona's Cracker Barrel.
Waited for 40 minutes for our food to come out and it was cold. The service was average at best. The store experience was great. Very nice and pleasant people working the store. Saved my experience some..."}
{"text":"Since there are no cracker barrels in CA, I must stop at one if I'm in an area that have them. To my surprise, AZ has an abundance of cracker barrels. This location is very clean. Our server was very friendly. I love the country store area where you can find knick knacks of all sorts. Get the hash brown casserole!"}
{"text":"Will not ever be back. 

The store was over-packed full of people wandering around touching dust covered, American flag themed junk. There's no organization or actual waiting area. It's hard to even try to stand out of the way with so many people jostling past you. 

After waiting 25 minutes for a table, we were finally seated and waited another 20 minutes to be acknowledged. Finally had to waive someone down and ask for service. When our waitress finally decided to arrive, she took our full order and then we waited yet another 15 minutes for water and a cup of coffee to make it to the table. 

No apologies or acknowledgement of the terrible service, food came out cold, and we wasted well over 1.5 hours there for what should have been a quick trip. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend and won't be back myself."}
{"text":"First time to a Cracker Barrel, so I'm not sure what the norm would be. The service was friendly. We enjoyed that they offer a sling for car seats; that made it more comfortable to watch our little one. The food was about what I expected. It wasn't the most phenomenal, but it wasn't bad either. Just some nice, simple, comfort food.
I'm only docking stars because I thought the dumplings would have been a little bit better, but they seem very mass produced. Mine also had a fairly large clump of \"dumplings\" stuck together. Also the cornbread was not sweet like you expect cornbread to be. It was almost like the mix was off.
Other than that everything else was great. I suggest the biscuits over the cornbread though. They taste like they are made with a stick of butter each. Paula Deen would be proud."}
{"text":"This is true mid-west fattie food, and I love it! The best: thanksgiving dinner, on thanksgiving!

The food is always mid-west heavy, it is the food I remember eating in WI. They serve breakfast all day and there are different specials running through out the year. I cannot eat enough of the thanksgiving dinner, which runs though the weekend of the holiday. How can you go wrong when you can over eat just enough not to feel sick (which includes dessert) and some one else cleans the dishes for you?!?  

Oh! BTW, you can now order a whole thanksgiving meal carry out here!

They also at times have this chicken wrapped in tin foil cooked in all the veggies, it is a special, but when it comes around, GO FOR IT!!!!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at a Cracker Barrel, to me it is simply good Homestyle food I can always count on and this visit was great. We stopped in for lunch and had an excellent meal. I had the fried catfish with hash-brown casserole and fried okra.  Oh my stars was it good.  I just thinking about it makes me wanna go there for dinner tonight!  Any place that can make my mouth water just thinking about it is a winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Asked for my steak to be medium rare.. I got fully cooked! Where's the pink? Asked for apple butter got regular butter.. the only thing good was the pancakes and lemonade.. and the service was horrible.."}
{"text":"Not like the one on SAT. You guys Embarrassed meIn front of my colleagues in front of my family not cool"}
{"text":"I'd like to give this place at least a 3 because the hour was late but the staff that we interacted with were wonderful. Very friendly and proud of their food. However they should contact Bisquick and at least make the dumplings on the back of their box because really what they served was a poor excuse for a dumpling. Also to call it chicken and dumplings is not a lie. It's a few pieces of albeit tender chicken covered with a scant beige gravy with copious square pieces of noodle dough. Yes, I realize that this is more of a Pennsylvania Dutch dumpling but this was bad. We won't order that again. Ever."}
{"text":"Food was great as usual however we had a 24 minute wait.  Luckily the crayons and coloring book kept my 6 year entertained while we waited. When the food came it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I have ever experienced. Cold and doughy pancakes. Service was slow and couldn't get the order correct. All around bad experience. I found the only Cracker Barrel in America that did not give a military discount. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My fries were barely warm even though I asked for well done fries, and my burger was similarly barely warm (wouldn't melt the cheese). My wife's cobb salad had a bad piece of meat too. None of that was the waiter's fault, so left him a good tip. The cashier complained because I wrote it for an even amount, so now she had to do the math."}
{"text":"This is a review for their breakfast menu, which I highly recommend. I've never been disappointed ordering breakfast here. My favorite plate is the mama's French toast with the hashbrown casserole (delicious.) I always add cheese to my eggs too. The only thing that was a bit lacking was the waitress. She wasn't very attentive. Def give breakfast a try here!"}
{"text":"Great place! Fresh coffee! Well staffed; makes a huge difference! We were seated immediately upon arriving; 8:30am shift. Loved the decor and the little store they have; you can shop while you wait to be seated. 

The food was nothing special, but I love their normal size portions. Prices are affordable. Would come back."}
{"text":"I didn't get a chance to eat here but the store was amazing. Def going to eat hear next time I'm out this way."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has great decor to keep you occupied while you wait, or you can shop in the store or before you leave. I've been to this restaurant type establishment many time. Good ole country food. The service was slow, waitress wasn't somewhat okay, food was luke warm. I'll be back, but this place is just a bit above going to Denny's."}
{"text":"Simple review...

Typically great food, nice atmosphere and attentive wait staff. A favorite of our family.

Occasionally, the food is a bit \"off\" but no more so than any other restaurant that I frequently eat at. Nobody is perfect. 

The key is customer satifaction. This location does an excellent job of making things right if things are not up to par (a rare occurrence).

If you're a fan of Cracker Barrel and/or the type of food they serve, give this location a try.

I think you'll be glad."}
{"text":"Food is always consistently good and service is quick. Good comfort food on a snowy day."}
{"text":"I am always satisfied and leave happy with a full belly and a smile on my face! The pancakes are always a hit! The granola and yogurt is fantastic! Along with the blueberry muffin and what a great start to the day! You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"It's a homey, country atmosphere,  the waitresses are friendly and the shop is fun to walk around. I absolutely love their hash brown casserole. It's the place I love to go to when I don't feel like cooking. Their gravy could use some salt but their biscuits are incredible :)"}
{"text":"Food has steadily declined over the last six months or so. We used to eat there  at least once every two weeks,  if not more. We really enjoyed the attention to the little things. Like the butter melting on the French Toast (not coming out frozen and making your food cold). We would go there for a hearty wholesome meal that felt like home cooking only none of the work. Unfortunately in recent days at least one of us has lost our appetite due to food that was less than appetizing."}
{"text":"Karen was awesome!  After a very disappointing start, due to lack of appropriate customer service from Liam, Karen was an amazing bright light!

The food was great and aside from the rough start!"}
{"text":"I have had hair in my salad, raw haddock, watery chicken and dumplings, and rock hard biscuits.  Too many places to eat in Las Vegas to waste any more time here."}
{"text":"Our server was genuinely friendly and helpful, food as always was amazing!!! I love the hash brown casserole. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel, we were excited to see that this arrived in Las Vegas. We had this before when we were in Indiana and it was just good ol traditional American breakfast. It was a wonderful experience in the Midwest, but out here it's meh...

Out in the Midwest some chains are real good as well as the experience, but that's because they been doing it for years. When they bring it out here in the West people get excited, but  it's all hyped up the experience and is not the same. 

Just like your typical popular restaurants and chain out here expect to wait up to 1-2 hours depending when you arrive in the morning. We arrived at 7:15am on Sunday and we still had to wait 30 minutes. Once we left it was 8:50am and we over heard the wait was two hours or so... 

The food was decent and service was so so. Like I said it just open and of course it is going to take sometime until they have all the cogs working in unison. We had some eggshell residue on our eggs, we did bring it up to management so they know. They did offer to give new batch of eggs, so that was good of management to try to rectify the issue that had occurred.

They also have mini store in the front, it will be very crowded, seeing there plethora of people waiting so they are just walking around site seeing until called upon. Once done the payment option is very inefficient. You have to pay your tab while waiting in line with the rest of people shopping at the mini shopping center. So it can take a while.

To be honest with you it's not worth the wait and crowd to have to wait just for bacon, eggs, grits and other breakfast items typically served everywhere else. We ate at the Cracked Egg and it was exceptional breakfast almost similar to Cracker Barrel. I'm sure there are plenty more breakfast joints, but we thought we try out Cracker Barrel because we had a great experience dining and customer service out in the Midwest.

We probably will not return to this place, seeing how saturated it is with hype and people wanting to eat there."}
{"text":"This is one of the rare situations where I review a chain restaurant. This is an awesome Cracker Barrel location. The service is impeccable and super friendly every time that I go whether it is for breakfast, dinner, or carry-out. My personal favorite for dinner is the chicken and dumplings, roast beef dinner, or meatloaf. They are all so yummy and you get SO much for for such a low price. All of the breakfast choices are great as well. I love the cheese potato casserole. I also love that they will poach your eggs for you. Same greatness you would expect from cracker barrel without the bustling interstate nearby!"}
{"text":"The waitress MARIA ROSANNA was horrible come on now? She act like she don't care about her job and I don't recommend her to anybody. MARIA ROSANNA find a different job because you SUCK"}
{"text":"This place is just weird. It's very crowded, other people seem to like it a lot, but not me. The whole \"Country Store\" theme throws me for a loop. It's strange. I had some egg-sausage combo for breakfast, that I thought would be a casserole-type thing, but turned out to be just 'taters and tiny pieces of sausage cooked together. Eggs were plain as can be, overall experience was a giant MEHHHHH. No thanks."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel very rarely gets a complaint from me! Everything is great. The service is 99.9% perfect. The staff works hard and they are exceedingly friendly. They have a new item on the menu since I last visited. The Brussels sprouts kale salad is my new favorite item. I couldn't get enough of it when I was there. The store is great. We stock up on the little bags of peppermint sticks when we head home. My son loves to try all the unique bottled sodas. (12 oz in glass bottles) When we are on vacation we eat there multiple times. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy, I stop here every time I am in the burg.  Good location, good food and a fun store to check out!  Best Dumplings!"}
{"text":"Greetings,

We ate at this location for dinner in July 2017. The summer special, roasted chicken with corn and carrots, was excellent. We also had the Cracker Barrel sampler, which had great seasoning and flavor. Our waitress was nice and did not rush us out. She also came by 3-4 times to check on us during the meal. This was our first ever trip to a Cracker Barrel, and we were very happy overall in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"My 10 year old son chose this place last night to celebrate his birthday. We hadn't been in a while so that's where we ended up. It was busy, as most Friday evenings are at any restaurant in the area. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated. We had to wait about 10 minutes after being seated for our server to come and ask for our drink order. When I ordered a diet Coke she said, \"It's broken and gross.\" Ok - so I got a lemonade instead which was good. We waited forever for our meal. She only checked on us once the entire time. I think it took 90 minutes from the time we got there until the time we checked out. Lovely little place, but will not be coming back until they get it together."}
{"text":"Christmas Bacon!  

Second time we go through this! We asked our waitress for our bacon to be extra crispy, she replied we don't do that here! We asked again, we request that it be extra crispy please telling her we are the customer and she replied by saying,\"we will try.\" I do not know what's so hard about leaving the bacon an extra minute on the grill? Also we wanted to substitute the toast for pancakes and told her we didn't mind an extra charge. She replied by saying, \"we don't do that this ain't iHop.\"  Other than that, the food is delicious too bad the experience with the waitress wasn't equivalent."}
{"text":"Always good for breakfast. The service is quick and efficient. They make amazing grits. I can't speak to the rest of the menu so much as I tend to get breakfast any time of the day there. 

I absolutely love the little store that captures you at the front end of things. Even if I don't buy anything it's fun to look around and wish or reminisce about childhood toys and soda."}
{"text":"Watson Road is one of the last stops on the West side of Buckeye while heading towards California so I knew I should stop for a bite to eat (or wait over an hour til the next town). 

I saw the signs for a Cracker Barrel and my memories of a good 'ol hot country breakfast sounded real good. When I got inside and realized how packed the place was, I decided to order the food to go. 

So, based purely on what I could eat while driving, I had to say no to the biscuits and gravy I so love or their fluffy pancakes. I narrowed it down to handheld food; sandwiches. Almost went with their catfish or grilled chicken, but ended up with the meatloaf sandwich (hoping for a lil bit of comfort with each bite). 

The sourdough bread (which had some sort of glaze) was really good, but it wasn't toasted so the meatloaf started to make the bread soggy. And their meatloaf wasn't thick and generous like I've had at BJ's or other restaurants. And because it wasn't made too firm, it kept falling out of the sandwich and onto my shirt (lucky, no car accidents). 

The store had neat stuff (bought a cow mug that had utters) to browse while waiting for my meal and the servers (thanks Jenifer) were great. But if you want to eat and enjoy their food, don't get it to go. My biggest mistake."}
{"text":"went recently for dinner, and must say was not happy with the meal.

service was ok. lacked certain things like the bread to come out before the meal, or refilling the 2 drinks we had. 

my issue was not just with the service, but the food. I ordered the meatloaf. it tasted just warm. not hot at all. same with the chicken fried chicken, was just warm..or not hot.

also noticed the portions seemed much much smaller then previous visits. not sure if that is due to portion controlling, but it definitely seemed like it was portion controlled with a scoop of each side dish.

not interested in going back to this location."}
{"text":"11/25/17. 
Food was OK not great. 
The way the tables are arranged felt a bit like a cafeteria.  People like to have a sense of their own space. 
We were there at a busy time and the restaurant seemed dirty. 

The country store was cute.  The lady helping out on the sales floor was great."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast. After being seated, we waited 8 minutes before waitress showed up! Took our order and another waitress brought our food in just a few minutes. After she left we discovered, no butter! At this point we tried to get a waitress. There were many and few customers. Of course not one would look at us. Finally we flagged down a server. Asked her to get our server to bring us butter. After a few more minutes our server brought the butter. No \"I am sorry\" or nothing. Just put it down and walked off.
 I don't know what has happened to customer service here. There had to be 8 servers in our area and 9 tables with customers. All the servers seemed to be hanging out in kitchen. 
 Come on Cracker Barrel get with the program! The program is customer service......."}
{"text":"Review not about food but just watched a couple walk out after speaking with the manager about how they received no service. We sat in the table next to him and was served right away. So this yelp review goes out to the manager here that you need to go back to management school. You looked upset and even argued with the poor customer. You should have made it right!"}
{"text":"Had to wait to order while waitress cleaned tables,  steak  was supposed to be well done  it was still bleeding  to death on my plate and rest of food was cold ,  want good service  and food look elsewhere"}
{"text":"The sad thing is, I didn't even get to eat anything from this Cracker Barrel because no one would bother to take our order.

My family and I had been on the road for several hours driving from a Washington, DC vacation back to Alabama. We probably spent 2 hours in DC traffic. All total in the car about 7 hours. We decided to stop in Charlotte to spend the night to break up the trip. 

The hotel we stayed at had room service but it was pricy. My hubby offered to go pick something up (even though he just drove forever). There was a Cracker Barrel close to the hotel (.5 mile) so he was going to order and pick up.

Now granted it was 10 pm but the restaurant was open until 11. He called and said he'd like to place an order for pick up. They transfer him and he again says he'd like to place an order for pick up. He's on hold then someone just hangs up on him.

So he calls back and the person who transferred him asked \"did they not pick up\" and he told them no. So they transferred him again. They pick up and he again says he'd like to place an order for pick up. Then he hears someone in the background yell and I quote \"tell em we closed!\" 

So he just hangs up and tells me we probably don't want to eat there. If they don't even care about taking our order then what in the world could they have done to our food.

This place could be a great establishment but don't ever try to place an order for pickup after a long tiring car trip... All we wanted were two salads and a kid's chicken finger meal... I don't think that would've been too hard to throw together..."}
{"text":"Back in old Cracker Barrel had a great breakfast 
Just little syrup for the pancakes 
But very nice people 
Can't go wrong 
Always make me happy to be here"}
{"text":"My husband, our friend and  I stopped here for lunch on our way up to the U.P. on Friday, Sept 14th.  We were quoted a 15 minute wait by the host.  Odd as it was apparent there were several open tables in each of the sections but OK, we will look around the store. We were seated in 15 minutes in the back section of the restaurant.  After waiting several minutes to be acknowledged by anyone I started looking around and a server Fran came to our table. She asked if we had been greeted and we told her no. She said our server was stuck at the window, but she would take our drink orders and get them to our server. We gave her our drink, food orders.  Now, another 10 or so minutes pass and we still do not have our drinks or have had our server come by the table.  I look around and see the seating host and tell her that we are still waiting for our drinks and our server has not stopped by ( except Fran). Fran at just about that moment comes out with our drinks and we ask if she is going to be our server and she said no that Ciera would be with us.   

Shortly thereafter Ciera stops on her way to another table and says in a flustered way that she would be with us shortly and at least our orders were in.  Really?  No apology or explanation,  She knew we were not pleased with that and did not see her again until the food arrived.  It was a horrible start to our visit and had it not been for Fran greeting our table we probably would have walked out.   The place was a mess. Lots of open tables but several not bussed for the entire time of our visit.  We are restaurant managers and 'get\" that sometimes there are staffing issues etc but it was apparent there were major issues that day. Ciera had a 9 top, 6 top and several other smaller tables and it was clearly beyond her ability to handle the volume.  We did not tip our server but gave a tip to Fran who deserves some kind of acknowledgement for recognizing a problem and addressing it with us.  When we left the two sections of the dining areas were about 1/2 seated, yet we heard the host quoting a 20 minute wait, which again leads us to believe their were major issues with either the service or kitchen.  Our food was correct and was good but the service was horrible.  We will not return to this Cracker Barrel again on our monthly trips."}
{"text":"I have been waiting to try Crackerbarrel for years as they always play commercials in LA but fail to put a location close enough to go to. (Boy, what a tease!) I had high expectations and luckily they were all met. I was so happy it was as good as I expected. 
The wait for two was about twenty minutes on a Wednesday late morning. The inside is big enough to sit a decent amount of people but small enough to feel \"Home-y\".
Because it was my first time there and knew I wouldn't be back anytime soon, I got a sampler breakfast plate of eggs any style, ham, sausage and bacon, grits, hash, fried apples and biscuits. Yum yum and yum. 
The biscuits were soft and warm, the hash brown casserole was seasoned well, the grits were solid, and all the meat was good. The sausage was my least favorite, though. I also didn't like the fries apples which actually look like basic baked apple pie filling. I am not a huge Apple fan period so that was no loss. 
All and all it was delicious. For me, in order for a place to get five starts they need to live up to the image they present. Cracker Barrel prides itself on being an \"old country store\" and that just what it felt like. A comfortable atmosphere to get quality all American favorites and friendly service."}
{"text":"Traditional American southern breakfast fare done right. 

We came here before watching the LA Kings play the (then Phoenix) Coyotes for Game 1 of 2012 WCF. 

The restaurant was huge and there was no wait. There are plenty of choices to choose from in the neighborhood. We were just across the street from Jobing.com Arena and the outdoor mall it's attached to, but we wanted breakfast and were eager to try Cracker Barrel. I've had their toad in a hole, grits, biscuits, and sweet tea. The hash brown casserole is really good. It was like a baked scalloped potato dish with a different cut on the potatoes. The boyfriend had chicken fried steak and loved it. He asked for an extra side of the gravy for his biscuits. 

The register where you pay for your meal is attached to a cute gift shop. There you can find retro memorabilia. I grabbed a couple packs of Black Jack gum because it reminded me of Seinfeld. 

This location is perfect if you are trying to catch a hockey game."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Cracker Barrels in Utah and I love this one just as much. We did have a wait but we didn't mind- going through the gift store works for me! Our server Michael was great- we appreciated his recommendations for today's special their buttermilk chicken- way too good! Food was hot and tasty and came out in record timing. The coca cola chocolate cake is amazing- I definetly recommend sharing or not if you're feeling extra selfish  . The table next to us ordered the same thing because how much we went on. Great Job!!"}
{"text":"The place was easy to find this was my first visit but trust me won't go there no more the food was ok I ordered grits eggs over easy bacon and pancakes they gave me a very little bowl of grits I had to wait on my grits cause she forgot to put it to order only thing that was good was pancakes and lemonade won't go there no more it was expensive wasn't worth it at all"}
{"text":"I've gone there several times just for breakfast and have never been disappointed. I love the service. They are very friendly and thoughtful. I love the hash browns  and the grits. Seems like a old fashion combo. The food is always warm to hot when I get it. The coffee is always full and I don't have to hunt down the wait staff to get my coffee filled. My mom came down from Montana and she loved the wall decorations (she could relate) and the over all experience."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has a cool southern genre that attracts many of us to visit regularly to hit up our favorites.  

While staying at Nellis AFB, my friend's graciously took me to dinner at CB. The food was righteous in an average way. Our meals and drinks were what we had before. No surprises, no disappointments. Well the bread was delayed and our waitress a little flighty but ultimately proved competent. 

Even though their boring, CB holds a place of decent Southern Chow for the masses. You get the same flavor in Vegas as you get in Atlanta. 

Ultimately, 3-Star righteous chow. You won't lose sleep if you drive by. But you'll be full if you stop.  Check them out!!! I mean if you want.  Starbucks is next store for an after dinner Coffee."}
{"text":"I realize this location is brand new and super busy, but that is no excuse for serving cold food with rock hard biscuits.   Been here twice since they opened, once for breakfast and once for lunch, and food was cold both times.  I am fine with the long wait and the slow service, but can't tolerate cold food.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel offers a good country style food.
It's better than cafeteria food with a country store attached to the restaurant.
This is not a high end but will fill your gut."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is friendly and the food is delicious! They definitely aren't skimpy on serving sizes! Love that I can shop here before or after I have eaten. Nice friendly family environment!I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had not been back in over 10 years since a bad egg sandwich at a location in the south I can't remember. It turns out that I should have returned sooner. At least on this visit, my meal was top notch and under 600 calories. Yes, a diet menu of sorts at the home of country cooking. Trust me, I saw alot of people dining that day that probably have no clue that Under 600 calories menu even existed. They missed out on a large chicken cutlet breaded in corn flakes and served with mixed veggies and your choice of a healthy side. My sweet potato with butter was an excellent choice to complete the meal. Of course, more than 600 calories was consumed due to good biscuits and corn bread, but gotta eat those right?
You still need to do the gift shop shuffle to eat and exit, but I will no longer scoff my nose at the next Cracker Barrel I pass on the freeway."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel at Sheffield Village: nightmare experience at 2:00 in the afternoon today. Sat and waited at a table for over 20 minutes. Multiple servers passing by and not one stopped to take a beverage order, explain the delay, or offer to be right with us and take our order as soon as they could. The restaurant was not busy and appeared very well staffed- inexcusable for such horrible service."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight. Ordered the fish dinner and asked for cod. Got 3 catfish and 1 cod filet. Complained to the manager and he informed me that they didn't have catfish which I found very strange since it is on the menu! He did everything but come out and call me a liar. He took my drink off the bill to \"compensate\" for it. Needless to say, I won't be going back any time soon and it was one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We went in at 7:30 pm on Saturday, 6-3-17, and sat in the main dining area. There were see-through shades that were pulled down to minimize the late afternoon sun coming through the west windows, but they were not enough. It was blinding from 7:30 pm to 8:30 pm. I think they need to replace them with something more effective.  The breakfast was great. I had French toast, bacon and scrambled eggs. My companion had roast beef, stewed apples and a salad. The meat had a lot of fat and the apples had too much sugar. He told the manager that he'd never come back. I would, but probably just for breakfast."}
{"text":"Standard cracker barrel.  Solid food, friendly service.  They did mess up an order (brought bacon instead of sausage) but remedied it immediately."}
{"text":"I always love Cracker Barrel. I love the general store ... I must tell you to try the Coca Cola double chocolate cake . Trust me. The rib eye was good"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is my favorite restaurant, but this was more of an average experience for me. Our waitress was clearly in training, as at some points she seemed unsure of what she was doing, and she didn't check on us as much as I would have liked. One person in my party also asked to have their food separated, and it all came on the same plate, making them unsatisfied, although she enjoyed the food itself. The biscuits and cornbread were very good, even if they weren't warm or soft.

I paid $8 for four pieces of french toast with cinnamon apples, with bacon and eggs on the side, though, so I was happy with my meal."}
{"text":"ALL sorts of emotions here. 

If you KNEW the journey I have been through for Cracker Barrel, only THEN would you understand how excited I am that they have a location in Las Vegas. Yeah sure, it's about 4 hours away from home, but it's closer than Chicago -- which is how far I flew out the last time I wanted their deliciously fluffy pancakes.

So if this isn't the only review you've read on Yelp, then you know that there is probably going to be a wait. And if you are one of those lucky people who didn't have to wait at all, then you're in the right city - the city of Lady Luck!  I am assuming, like many other things in this town, you are taking a gamble when you choose to dine here.  We went on a Saturday morning and we waited an hour for breakfast.  Our breakfast ended up being our lunch, but thank goodness they serve breakfast all day!

To be honest, it's just breakfast food. So why wait an hour? Because it's nostalgically delicious breakfast food.  
Here are some things that you must order: pancakes, biscuits and gravy, cheese hash browns, and their corn bread.  You can get their eggs, or grits, or sausages... those are common place... ohhh but something about their pancakes, makes an hour long wait almost worth it.

That's about it, really.  I can see why people are so angry after waiting a few hours for food.  
I get it. 
But for me, nothing says \"I love you\" like syrup and melted butter over a nice stack of hot cakes.  Am I coming back? Oh yeah..."}
{"text":"It was busy when we went but what do you expect when going to a well known place on opening week. But the service was good and prompt. The food was great."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and cooked to perfection. Unfortunately it took a while to place our order and get our food. They were completely understaffed and while the girl was trying her hardest it was too much fit her to keep up with."}
{"text":"I have no idea where to start on this review. How about the wait time? I think so. So we walk up in front we see a lot of people waiting which is reasonable knowing it's Sunday morning. I tell the girl I need a table for 7 and she said about 35 minutes or any time before that. That's not a bad wait time to be honest so we sat down and waited. I wanted some coffee so I got into the car and went and got coffee and came back and my friends were still sitting outside waiting at this time it's been about 45 minutes so I go up and ask her how much longer and she say 5 minutes. Another 15 minutes passed by before they call our name so over an hour of waiting time... Table and terrible you're so close to other people's table there no sense of privacy and you can hear everyone's conversations. How about they make the gift store place smaller and give more room for the restaurant itself. I ordered some meat thing and asked for only bacon and scrambled eggs. It was good for like an appetizer. I ate it in like 2 minutes all of it. Kinda sucked. The corn bread is gross. The waitress FLO was legendary made us laugh that's the only reason I gave this place 2 stars. Haha. Thanks for a good time FLO but I won't be seeing you anytime soon."}
{"text":"So... Cracker Barrel. It's industrial. It's country. It's kitsch. It's formulaic. It's rocking chairs on the \"front porch\". It's also Goldenberg Peanut Chews. On the road, it's a decent place to stop for all-american comfort food. Not too far off the highways So, you foodies may stick your nose up at this place, but I'll stop here and eat."}
{"text":"I am guessing they are not equipped or trained to handle this many people. We waitied about an hour and half which is fine. We expected the long wait but once we finally sat down and ordered we then waited and waited and waited. The two tables that were next to us that were seated after we were, and had finished thier meals when we were just receiving the first half or our order. 
The waitress obviously had gone on break and the manager does not know how to notice many plates of food not going out. The food came out dry and hard. After explaining to the waitress twice which plates we were  still missing they finally got all of our completr order on to the table. It had now been about 2 hours and 15 min since we arrived. 
The fist table that was seated after us now had been cleaned with new patrons ordering but we were just grateful to have something hard and dry to crunch on.
Had to flag the waitress down for drink refills the rest of the dinner.
All my previous visits to other locations were great and I really hope Vegas gets things straightned out."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with the family. Our server was very friendly and brought us our drinks right away. The food was good, the only neg would be that the oil used to cook our food tasted old/overused. My son still gobbled down all his pancakes. Staff in the front store were friendly and helpful as well."}
{"text":"Ok so this is an amazing place for Breakfast! If you love country styled comfort food then you picked the right place! 

3 stars for over all food and price

If I could score the bathrooms here at this location it would be 1 star. I'm not sure if they were overly busy in the kitchen or on the dinning room floor but they neglected the bathroom while I was here. 

It was gross! 

But like I said the food was great but not the \"truck stop\" bathroom"}
{"text":"I dined here while on vacation in AZ. It was my first time and I had high expectations but it was just ok. I really wanted a steak for breakfast but it wasn't on the menu which is a little strange to me for a place that specializes in breakfast.  Catfish is on the menu and it was stinking up the joint and not really the food I want to smell when eating in the morning. I had the french toast and it was just blah...nothing special. They give you little individual bottles of syrup that are so cute but unfortunately the taste isn't that great. CB has great ambiance and that's about it."}
{"text":"Oh Cracker Barrel...How do I love thee? Let me count the ways...1) Your pancakes are always delicious with a slight crisp to the edges. And a little birdie told me it's because they cook them in...(wait for it...WAIT FOR IT...) margarine! *GASP!* The condiment snob in me is slightly disturbed that they don't use real butter to cook them, but it's still delicious. 2) I love that I get syrup in cute little glass individual bottles that are warm and ready to drizzle on my carbolicious plate. 3) It's simple, cheap eats. I pretty much only hit up this location because it's literally 5 minutes from my mom's crib in the great city of Buckeye. And they pretty much know me and my family here by name. We're kind of a big deal here. And by big deal, I mean we're fatties who love to eat. But more so probably because my sisters used to work here. Any who, if you're in Buckeye and want some grub that isn't fast food, stop here."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Cracker Barrel restaurants for over twenty years, and with the exception of a handful of meals and locations, I've relied on them for road trip meals due to consistency and quality.

Living in Buckeye, I'm sorry to say that this location is not one of the better restaurants. The only CB worse than this is the one in Clinton, NJ on I-78. That one downright bites, and I've given them several chances.

No, if you have a yen for one of CB standard comfort food dishes, I'd say go to Litchfield Road at I-10 in Avondale and pass on this location in Buckeye. Must be the management......................"}
{"text":"Oh, the horror, the horror..............

Okay not really. More of a disappointment and a bummer.

In a nutshell- apathetic General Manager acting as expeditor sent out food that should not have gone out to clients. He should have looked at it first- nothing major, a baked potato cut down the middle with a large black \"tumor\" of rot hidden beneath the skin at one end. Could happen to anyone at home, I didn't want a free meal, but I thought that as expeditor he should be more alert.  His response was no response until he waited on me at the register, where his comeback to the issue was \"it was an eye.\"  No, it was not a potato eye- they are external root sprouts and not black- and even so, what restaurant serves potatoes without trimming eyes?  He proceeded to grow increasingly more condescending, apathetic, and overtly rude albeit being rude using \"kind\" words- the dismissive \"thanks for coming and you have a nice day\" said in a tone of voice that essentially translates to \"F off.\"  He just would not take ownership for the oversight, and obviously is not a person to learn from his mistakes. He's in the wrong business.  I have had salads served to me with the huge copper staples from the lettuce crate in my salad and expected nothing but for the prep cook in the pantry to use more diligence when washing and chopping lettuce. I didn't even want an apology, just a simple acknowledgment that there was an oversight that needed to be more closely heeded before sending food out from the line. All I got was attitude from a young man whose age I double, but who believes that he knows much more than I do and whose authority is not to be challenged. 

My server Emmy was great, she got a 30% tip from me. That manager netted a phone call to Cracker Barrel customer service. I've eaten at Cracker Barrels all over the USA for 21 years now, and have never been addressed or treated so rudely as my experience today.  Hopefully corporate in Lebanon, TN will sort this fellow out."}
{"text":"service is decent its really slow tho drinks are ok the food is good anyway place is ok over all probably top thirty places to eat"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the 3rd time. The first two visit was ok but this time not so good. Me and my wife was seated near the entrance and we could see people coming in and get seated. A couple was seated about 7 min. after us and then I observed another couple get seated 4 min. after that. After waiting 15 min waiting for a waiter to just get us a drink order then it took another 7 min. for waiter to come back to take our order for our meal. It was about 30min. now and I see those who were seated after us getting served before us and I asked my wife,\" what is going on\"? I notice a guy with a tie walking around so asked him, \"why is it taking so long for my meal to be served\". I also told him that the couples seated at a later time are already being served. The man commented by saying, \"it all depends on your order\". I said, \"well I didn't order anything special\". He said, \"I will look into it\". This guy showed no immediate concern. Minutes later our oder came and but it was missing a few orders so they went to get the other orders one at a time. We had to ask twice for things like bread, butter etc. we never saw the waiter come back to ask if we needed refills for our water. I did leave a tip because I don't believe in Not leaving a tip. The food was ok when we finally got it. The service was Not so good. When I paid the cashier asked how was the food, \"I said it was good but the service was not so good\". He said, \"would you like to talk to someone about that\"? I said, \"I don't think it's going to make a difference now\". My wife really likes this restaurant for the food but for me I'd rather have good service. It will think twice when my wife ask me to come here."}
{"text":"I will start by saying this place is HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. If I can leave a review with no star then I would. Save your money on this one buddy! Food portions are small skimpy small and the food is disgusting! We had a party of several people and all several people had bubbly guts or super bad gas! Your better off going to Black Bear Diner a few minutes drive away or Denny's or IHOP. Oh yeah and over priced too a kids breakfast not including a drink was about $4.50 for a small azz pancake just one pancake not even medium sized. The same price for a yogurt parfait, I could've got a better meal at McDonalds for cheaper"}
{"text":"Fred's Playland gives them two thumbs up. Great overall experience. Especially considering we brought them a bus load. That can be extremely challenging. The service was impeccable, The food was served quickly and it was delicious. I especially enjoyed the new Salmon Patties. They got us in and out and we were happy, full and on time. We look forward to visiting again next year on our annual Salt River Trip.

Last year we had a less than grand experience at The Cracker Barrel. They totally redeemed themselves on this visit

Good Job Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Worst. Visit. Ever.

I ordered chicken fried chicken, I got country fried steak. Once that got corrected, my chicken was burnt and dry. My corn was mushy. 

My mother's country fried steak was dry. 

My brother found an eyelash in his eggs. 

My sister in law had old vegetables. 

Our server was great, no complaints there. The kitchen needs to fix it up though!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Arrived roughly 25 minutes after placing the order and still waited 20 minutes after paying. It would have been faster to just eat there. No apology from the girl who brought out the order, however the girl at the register (Angelena?) was very nice."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel I'm so so happy your getting closer and closer to the west coast! I'm a California native but as a moderate traveler I've been around the different states and going to Cracker Barrel and it never disappoints! I always try something new and different each time I go and it's always good. This location and like all your locations I've visited the employees are above average nice and positive attitudes. It puts a smile on my face. As for the food this time around I went with the Meat Loaf dinner which came with meat loaf and 3 sides all for 10.99$ what a deal! As always it tasted really good. For being very packed the service was fast and efficient! Of course I'll always be a customer to your amazing chain. Just open in California so I don't have to be in another state to have such a fantastic meal! Always recommended!"}
{"text":"Had the Tuesday special of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. It was great! Super fast and kind service. Loved it, and their little shop is very fun."}
{"text":"Just ate there tonight. I never felt so jipped in all my lift. I got the roast beef it came to the table with 2 little pieces of beef. I said something to the waitress, and all she said that it is measured out in proportions. I have eaten there many times before, but tonight was far worse that any I have experienced."}
{"text":"I love coming to crackerbarrel cause it's close to where I live. The food is great but I have been here many times and have had horrible service the waitress look like they don't wanna be there. Food is great with lousy service."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years. Their food is good,  the prices are great. The last time I was here I got the country boy breakfast for $9.99. With this amount of food I had some for later."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw this Cracker Barrel in Vegas! I am a big Cracker Barrel fan just because the food is awesome and the store inside is cool to look at.

This location I noticed wasn't as crowded as the other locations that I have been to and wasn't as friendly as the other ones either. The waitress was still nice, but didn't seem happy that she wanted to be there. 

Their food is always awesome though! I love their chicken 'n' dumplings! Fried apples and fried okra are a great complement to the meal for sides. I also love their baked potatoes but you have to pay extra if you want to get that. With your meal, you get cornbread and buiscuits. Their buscuits are yummy! After your meal, you pay up at the front in the store. 

There is plenty of parking and seating inside the restaurant. It is next to Bass Pro Shop off the 15 freeway. As you wait to get seated, you can look around their store. The store has vintage sodas and cool toys and trinkets that you can buy. I would still recommend this place to other people because I love Cracker Barrel and I love that it is always near Bass Pro Shops."}
{"text":"Had their marinated and grilled chicken tenders with steamed broccoli, rice pilaf and tomato onion salad.  The meal was large enough to split and we were both full.  The chicken had a great flavor and was moist.  The rice had a great flavor but was a little aldente.  The broccoli was steamed perfectly as it still has a slight crunch.  The biscuits were also very good.  It was a great value for price."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel has to be the worst location for customer service. We came for dinner last night and ordered or meals. After ordering I flagged our waiter down to do for biscuits and cornbread, he responded that he has an order for them already in, 10 minutes go by and still have no biscuits. The waiter brings out our food after about 15 minutes and along with biscuits and cornbread. Along with our food he let's me know that they are all out of the Mac n cheese side I ordered. Instead of coming out to let me know that they were out before bringing my meal. 15 minutes into our meal a new set of customers came in and were say right behind us I listened to them order as I heard them ask for Mac n cheese . Their waiter did not say they were out of Mac and to my amazement their food all came out with a side of Mac. I asked to speak to a manager as our waiter never appeared after dropping the bill off. The manager had no apology nor one time did he say sorry for the inconvenience and after he went back to tell kitchen he came back and states they came in 30 minutes after you thats why they got Mac n cheese. This is by far the worst dining experience I have ever had and the worst experience I have had with a manager."}
{"text":"We always make it a point to eat at any cracker  barrel that we come accross. We really love their  food, gift shop  and their  service.  But this past experience  with them was not so great. Breakfast weren't  too impressive."}
{"text":"In general I love visiting cracker barrels when I am in a state that has one - this location is totally sub par in comparison with others. The gravy brought to the table looked as though it had been sitting under heat lamps. It was cold so I asked the waitress for some hot fresh gravy. She took it and returned about 10 min later with the same two bowls and said she microwaved them. In addition no jam or honey on the table - had to again ask and again it took a while for the server to return only to have 4 jam packets thrown in the table. 

I won't return to this location - probably explains why this one wasn't too busy on New Year's Day"}
{"text":"Never again.
They lost our order. We have to wait 30 minutes for our food. Got an apology at the 30 minute mark. We were pretty much sitting there for 30 minutes and no one telling us a damn thing. 

Our food came. It was cold. I was so damn hungry I just ate it. 

Didn't comp a single damn thing. Not even a drink. 
Goodbye this location forever."}
{"text":"My finicky four year old says its the best food shes ever had. I had to scold her to stop yelling \"yummy!\" at the top of her lungs to everyone passing by the table."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Reasonable prices. Clean restaurant. Not disappointed with the food. Had the old timer's breakfast. Plenty of food to fill my belly. Apple butter was good, so were the biscuits and hash brown casserole."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars here. Rare for me.Likely would get 4, which is still a Gr8 rating.

They R getting 5 simply due 2great food & great customer service.

Prices r a bit high for breakfast, but GR8 4 dinner. This isnt your local diner food. Its eating in grandmas kitchen, well worth a buck or 2 more.

Extensive menu, breakfast lunch or dinner. daily specials. Grandma's home cooked type meals.

For me a 4 star review because they do seem 2screw up orders more often then they should whether eating in or taking out. If U get Meatloaf, why is it sometimes a huge slab & other times its half the size?Ditto for their sides.Sometimes U  get a huge side order portions, sometimes U get a baby ones.No different w/any item,breakfast, lunch or dinner or side item. 

Frustrating to order XXXX w/3 sides of xxxx, xxx and xxx, & U just never know if ur getting the same size portions, of the exact meal(s) U always get just a few days ago/or today...whether eating in or eating out. If this occurs, which is more often then I would like, how do u explain why1 kids xxx is twice the size of others, same age, same order? Easy to deal w/if eating in, but vry hard if its a takeout, which for several people is several bags of food & plenty of room to screw up, leaving kids upset cause his/hers is more then theirs, when it should be the same.

Regardless, whether eating in or takeout, or breakfast lunch or dinner, the food is always gr8. many, many meals, covering their entire menu have been eaten and enjoyed by myself & my own family as I got older.

They could almost throw any price on any item, and while you may not like the price, you will love the food....No matter what it is, its as good as sitting in grandmas kitchen.

Loaded breakfasts are extensive, hard to navigate/figure out what you want due to the large and extensive items available. Similar for lunch and dinner, but lunch an dinner are still easier to navigate.

The 4 stars I say it deserves is based on one thing as stated above...When you order xxxx with sides of xxx, xxx and xxx, it will vary greatly sometimes. They are a chain. You'd think it would be easy to ensure 1 serving of xxx is going to be close every time or sides of xxx, xxx, or xxx will also be very close in proportion each time. Thats not the case many times and no, I do not understand why. I know the food will always be good, but I dont get the large variances in the proportions they serve. Thats why I would say 4 stars..or maybe even 3.5 cause lets face it, if you order the exact same items time after time, and while you know it will be good, you shouldnt be left wondering why you got twice the size of meatloaf or any item, then you did the last time.

The reason they are getting 5 stars is cause again, the food is great. And while its frustrating to get the same food items that always vary greatly in proportion, the customer service makes up for it. Many times, eating in, after food is delivered, we are all happy...dont say a word. No need to. But the server will look down and say 'Hmm, thats a smaller slab of meatloaf...a smaller portion of this, that or whatever..then you should have gotten..Im going to take care of it'...and she comes back with extra xxx, xxx etc....And take in to account, we were happy and content...didnt say a word, wasnt going to say a word...perfectly happy...ready to eat, nary a single complaint.....Yet without saying a word, the server notices it and is back with xtra xxx, xxx or xxx.....

How many places do this? Not many. Heck, most places even if you did complain, it would be like pulling teeth and likely get you nowhere...Here, while I notice my meatloaf is smaller then last time or my potatos, greens, anything at all is smaller then last time...Im happy...My family is happy...we are ready to eat...no need to say a word....Yet the server looks & says 'you should have gotten more meatloaf then that...you should have gotten more xxx or xxx...I'll be back..'...& before we can even say 'hey, dont worry about it..its all good..we are fine'...she (or he) is gone & then back with more food.

So, with great food, & that type of service, how can this not deserve 5 stars? Typically, I & my family do not do lunch here unless on the road..If on the road, its the first sign we look for as again, terrific food, impossible to not be happy with & they smartly locate themselves directly off of hwy exits. On the road...easy in, easy out for grandmas home cooking. Hard to beat. 

This particular location is like a g-dsend. All the years of only getting to enjoy CB if ur on the road...I, my family and anybody I/we know have always said/asked..'why dont they open spots we can enjoy everyday, if we arent travelling down the hwy'. 

Thankfully they listened, at least here in my area. 

And grandmas cooking is now only a couple miles away. 

I highly rec CB, but be prepared, especially with breakfast, U will have a hard time deciding but whatever you decide will be worth every penny & then some!"}
{"text":"Good as other crackle barrels which is natural.
The only problem I have the noise level..."}
{"text":"I used to go to CB back in Illinois and it was good.  Went there tonight for Thanksgiving and very disappointed.  I had chicken and dumplings.  Chicken was like the chicken you would get from a can at Sams club. The dumplings were good though. The gravy was plain with no flavor at all.   Making everything else just bland.  My brother had steak that again was dry and tasted like something you would get at the store.  

The waitress Daniela was awesome. Not her fault the food was bad.  Small portions too."}
{"text":"It had been quite a while since we ate at a Cracker Barrel. We stopped there when shopping at East Towne Mall. I ordered the pot roast and my husband ordered chicken and dumplilngs. Yuck! It had more salt than you'd find in food at McDonalds. The meat in the pot roast tasted processed. The dumplings were slimy. The vegetables were so salty, they were inedible. Pros: The shop is very cute. Cons: Don't eat the food."}
{"text":"Great place! Food was very good, seemed like I blinked at the food was at our table lol. Our server Courtney was very hospitable and good, she was a Rockstar! Loved the store, and my boys had to stop and play a game of checkers on the way out.  
Will be returning for sure!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, it brings out my inner fat kid. 
I always get the Old Timer Breakfast and finish it all (which is shocking because I never finish anything). The staff is always super friendly and the food always comes out hot and fast. Their bacon is amazing-soft and chewy and their hash brown casserole is excellent. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Aaron was a wonderful server! I would highly recommend requesting him at this restaurant. He made our meal very welcoming and I am glad that he was so understanding of our needs!"}
{"text":"Cracker barrel is amazing...period. Peple are complaining about the wait. It is brand new place. It's going to be busy for the first few months. Solution: Go on a weekday in the morning or for lunch and you won't have to wait. Others are complaining about the mediocre food; Solution: don't get fish at a place that is known for its southern food and its breakfast. I also saw a review about someone not liking the restaurant/country store combo.....umm hello?! It's called Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, the restaurant is just an added bonus. The food is yummy. The service is great (Our server Ashley was awesome and the manager was walking around helping to clear tables and bring people whatever they needed). The store is cute and has one of a kind things you can't find anywhere but Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Went here a lot in New England. The experience doesn't carry over.  Almost empty restraught ( for a Cracker Barrel). Yet our breakfast took a half hour to get to the table and my wife's food was over cooked.  My over easy egg was ice cold.  We left and went to the omelet house.  So at least in Las Vegas Cracker Barrel, known for having a great place to eat breakfast doesn't hold true here.  Was super bummed.  I would avoid dinner at any of these but to miss on breakfast?  Man I was bummed"}
{"text":"Great service! Sunday morning and we still had awesome service. Our waiters name was Ryan. Good job Ryan!"}
{"text":"Go to spot for my kind of food.  Great service includes managers here, thx guus.  Would recommend the hash brown casserole at any cost."}
{"text":"Food was just ok.  Service was lacking big time. Weren't checked, had to catch people. Manager checked on tables around us, but not come to our table. Very surprised!!!"}
{"text":"So I go to this place whenever I reminisce about my hometown in the south.  They have descent comfort food for really cheap price.  

*Food = descent comfort food (Fried okra mmm yum)
*Price = REALLY cheap
*Service = very nice, welcoming
*Atmosphere = interesting...they have really cute shop attached to the restaurant."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is the nearest location to my house in Matthews.  I've been at least 7-8 times since it opened and have never had a negative experience.  Never have I had to wait for a table, and my breakfast (all day, baby!) is usually served in  less than 10 minutes.  Jeremy is one of their best servers.  He is very attentive and helpful; overall, a really nice guy.  I request him each time we visit for lunch.  I love this place!

The worst part about going to this Cracker Barrel is making a left turn into the place on HWY 74.  Just kill me."}
{"text":"Other than the wait (because it's a new location) the food and service was excellent. Our waitress was super nice and friendly. The food came out in a timely manner and was excellent."}
{"text":"2 good things friendly staff and great bacon.  pancakes were like rubber, gravy like paste. If you like blueberry hill or even Dennys don't go here. food was so bad we left without eating anything"}
{"text":"This place was really good! I came here for breakfast with my dad and my niece on Memorial Day. I was happy that they were open since many places were closed for the holiday.

There was a bit of a wait, so we killed time looking around in the shop and sitting on the rocking chairs in front of the restaurant.

Once our name was called, we were seated in the very busy dining room. Our waitress was pretty good, although the food was slow to come out and we were starving.

I ordered Eggs in a Basket with over easy eggs and bacon. My meal also came with a hash brown casserole.

All the food was really good. The bread was toasted and buttered and had a good flavor. I actually ate one piece of bacon (I never eat pork) and it was delicious. Not greasy at all, nice and thick and yummy. The hash brown casserole was really good. Super oniony, but I love onions so it worked for me.

My niece had pancakes and I tried one. They were really sweet and they had a crunchy crust on the outside that was different than pancakes I have had. They were definitely good though. 

Too bad there isn't a Cracker Barrel in California!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Cracker Barrel, the food the store, the atomosphere! I took my son for a Mom & Son time, no complaints from him it's one of his favorites as well! It takes alot of food to fill my son's stomach but he had the pancake breakfast and finished every crumb, said he couldn't eat another bite. Brionna was our server, we never had to ask for anything, except for the yummy apple butter given upon request. My boy had never tried it, imagine that! He'll remember to ask for it now, loved it! I had the meatloaf sandwich, so good and cooked to perfection! Of course made a pit stop in the shop and picked up the cutest coffee cup at a great bargain! 
The perfect way to spend a day! Great food and great company!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location 7 times in the last 2 years. Each visit has been terrific. The staff was friendly, efficient and the food was delicious. The price was reasonable and the ambiance is country. This is one of those establishments that swims in warm and positive nostalgia. I love the country, farms and freedom. Cracker Barrel attempts to bring Old Country Amerciana to a suburban audience. I think it's fun.

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the homestyle cooked food and the great service the displays are lights. Three people can eat for reasonable price and walk out very full. Never disappointed with anything on the menu and a hash brown casserole is amazing. A must for breakfast."}
{"text":"Are server  Mandy was amazing. This was our first time at a Cracker Barrel restaurant and the food was wonderful and loved the atmosphere.  Mandy was very friendly and made our first visit very welcoming  and can't wait to come back going to try the breakfast next time"}
{"text":"Ahhh Cracker barrel. you know what you might get if you ever get in, so you look online and it says '5-10 minutes' - yeah right, but you put your name in anyway... and wait outside. and wait. and then you approach the outside hostess to inquire about an ETA and the clueless high school kid says 'they've already called for you, go inside and they'll seat you'. So when in the 20+ minutes that we had been sitting there did they call our name? They didnt. the inside hostess, a snide college kid says bluntly that she called us, so we advise her that we've been listening and did not ever hear our groups name, to which she insists that she did and that we will be seated. no clear apology even when both my wife and I couldn't have been more clear that that was all we were really looking for. flat-out refusing to apologize as if she was somehow in-the-right to just not listen to the customer.  we left. I may never feel the urge for a country boy breakfast ever again, and I'm oddly OK with that.

I know it is summer and the workforce shifts to kids who probably think they have better things to do, but no matter how popular a restaurant brand is, you can't ever forget customer service and its importance today. brands ebb and flow in popularity and kne day you may just need this customer again. 

also, if you have an online system, it should reflect in near real-time what the wait is or like and tell people it is longer. under-promising and then giving yourself the chance to over-deliver is always appreciated from the customer's perspective. 

I know that cracker barrel prides themselves on the old-timey country store, but it just creates a cluttered mess you have to wade through and gives you no good inside waiting option, unless you want to be part of the clutter others are trying to get through to do anything (restrooms are also tucked into this mess)..."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i have been here. My last visit here was much more pleasant than tonight.  After being seated, my boyfriend pointed out how filthy the floor was under most of the tables around us.  It was unacceptable, almost to the point of making me sick!  When I used the restroom, the theme carried on.  I know Easter Sunday is a busy day.......however......sweeping under tables between patrons shouldn't be difficult. Chances are I will not return here, well, maybe to sit outside on one of those comfy rockers! LOL
The one positive is...........my cornflake baked chicken was pretty tasty and the biscuits with apple butter were Delish! I may be tempted to return just to eat up some of that wonderful apple butter delight."}
{"text":"Old Timer's Breakfast hit the spot after a hike in the morning. For full breakfasts under $10 per head, what's not to love. We love the flavor of the hash brown casserole but the portion is small. Biscuits were great. Tip: ask for Apple butter to go with the biscuits. The sawmill gravy is okay, salty. If you are hoping for chunks of sausage, this gravy is not it. I asked for one egg over easy and another over hard. Eggs were perfectly done. Of course, I come here to enjoy their unlimited freshly squeezed lemonade served in a frosty mug. I tried my daughter's French toast. Yum with berries. If you like sourdough, their toast is great with jam and butter. Pancakes here are fried in bacon fat and crispy on the edges served with warm maple syrup in their Cracker Barrel bottles."}
{"text":"Great Party Room! This is why the staff of my school gather here for our year-end celebration. It has a great room that accommodates all of us in a private setting. The service courteous. I don't enjoy all the servers that had to keep our orders in order. The manager came by a few times to check-in. I wasn't particularly peckish so I had the Bacon with Hashbrown Casserole for $4.99. I enjoyed my lovely lemonade in a frosted mug. My first two were in a frosted mug. The third serving came in a regular glass with ice cubes (not cool). Were they trying to send me a message? Hint, hint, we don't want to give you another refill. Plus the ice diluted the lemonade. My colleagues ordered some beautiful meals which I photographed as well. The rating was lower this time because of the lemonade incident and the fact that they had only one cashier staffed for the morning. She complained that she had to fly solo until 11 am."}
{"text":"This place is a complete rip off!!! I was just handed a check for $19.37 for an omelette and a soda. It came with a fruit cup that was the size of a thimble. They charged me an extra $5.50 for the chicken. And of course, everything you add to this thing is an up charge. I have never payed anywhere near this much for an omelette. This is absolute theft!!! And I'm guessing by the fact that the waitress just told me to have a nice day while I'm still at the table means there's only one refill on the soda. I will NEVER come back here ever again!!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter here for our lunch date.  We were  seated directly across from the entrance into the kitchen.  Our food came out promptly and the orders were correct.  My one complaint, however, is that from I was seated I blatantly witnessed a couple of servers pointing and talking/laughing about other customers.  That should never be seen By a guest.  It is rude, and it's disrespectful.  Other than that we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"If you are only interested in the food, stop there.  Love the food.  Tonight the service was atrocious.  Never took a drink order. Gave out breakfast menus to some of our party and then took forever to come back.  Had to ask for salad after waiting too long.  the orders came and no one got what they ordered.  We all had to switch our plates around.  Three of us didn't have silverware.  Didn't bring out biscuits and corn bread.  Had to ask for it.  Had to ask for water refills because we didn't get to order drinks.  Brought check without asking if we wanted dessert.  She's was plain horrible.  The food is very good and if that's all you need them you'll be fine but if you want service don't go to this location."}
{"text":"Fish Friday.  For lunch Cod fish fry with green turnips, and corn bread. Amazing. Yum."}
{"text":"Mmm, Cracker Barrel.  The thought of it makes me nostalgic about cross-country road trips - east to west and north to south.  Driving back from Cali a little less than a month ago I noticed a billboard stating the grand opening would be July 25, 2016, so I immediately got excited.  IKEA can wait but Cracker Barrel couldn't, so I stopped by for an early dinner today only to see an expected line of people outside awaiting their turn while rocking in wooden rocking chairs under misting fans and hanging/shading burlap - although the entrance faces east.

I knew I didn't desire to wait two hours to be seated, so I searched on their website for online ordering or perhaps telephone ordering.  The wait for an online order was two hours as well; but, fortunately, I called and the wait for a telephone order was only 30 MINUTES!!  So, pre-order by calling ahead, but be sure to eat it right away - we wouldn't want all that yummy country goodness to get cold.

I ordered Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast which is two scrambled eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, homemade buttermilk biscuits with real butter and strawberry preserves, fried apples, and Country Fried Steak.  Mmm mmm, breakfast for dinner, $11.13.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is horrible. I would give the food a 4 and the service a 1. I absolutely love CB but its so hard to go when you know the service is going to be so bad. It just seems like the waitress is on her 1st day and has too many customers. I always get the french toast and its amazing every time. If only I could get a good waitress to go with the food and this would be a 5 star. Please CB- Hire some good waiters and crack down on the bad ones."}
{"text":"Breakfast is amazing and the menu is excellent.  I wish I lived inside the barrel and eat this everyday."}
{"text":"Love this place great service even with a party of 24 they were fast, patience and extremely pleasant. Everything was so good especially the pan cakes. I got the Sunrise Sampler and order the sweet ham not salty you will not regret it. The cheesy hash was oh so good and of coarse the Apple Butter!"}
{"text":"Ordered Uncle Hershel's an wife had the Sunrise Sampler. Didn't want the grits, but she brought them anyways. Only got one cup of coffee even though I had the creamer sitting in the cup waiting. Wife ordered sour dough and got white instead. Only one choice of jelly for the toast. So basically the food was what I'd expect from a Cracker Barrel and gets a 3  rating. Gina the waitress however gets a 2."}
{"text":"YUM! Only word that describes Cracker Barrel food. The pricing is low the plates are large the value is insane. The rustic feel is authentic the menu items are perfected and or server Kathy was awesome! Thank you! I would come back here over and over again! I wish they would open a location near me as I would be their best customer. I absolutely love their sweet tea and grandpas country fried steak breakfast"}
{"text":"We decided to try this after basketball is not open till 10 bass outlet.  Excellent serving sizes.  They have  variety which was nice because we weren't really that hungry and then some of were hungry.
Great service..sorry forgot her name"}
{"text":"For a chain I have no complaints.  Service is always friendly and uber polite. 

The French toast is delicious, the hash brown casserole savory and let's face it who doesn't love to eat the inside of an apple pie as a breakfast side! I prefer breakfast here but that's just because the bacon is always diner style CRISPY - another WIN.  Oh and did I mention you get your very own warmed bottle of pure maple syrup! 

I definitely do not come here often to eat - but I know what I'm getting if I do before I hit the door. 

The gift shop I utilize for unique gifts with that country charm, to purchase my favorite candy on the planet (Goo Goo Clusters) and look forward to the holiday season when the chocolate pecan pie is available to go."}
{"text":"My husband and I just went here for dinner. Unlike on a typical weekend morning, we were able to be seated right away. Which was great! It took quite a while for our server to come over so when she finally did we placed our food order with the drink order as well. 
She brought our drinks pretty quickly. The food also came out quickly and taste good. 
No issue with the food but our waitress never introduced herself, never made eye contact. She had no personality or sense of connecting with her customers. And I had to call her over to get a drink refill. Along with my refill she brought the check. Soooo food good but service leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"We've been waiting here for 2 1/2 hours.. And the table is not ready... This place is ridiculous... The management needs to fix their system in arranging the people's table.."}
{"text":"Great Home cookin' and excellent world class service from our waiter, Kevin. He was the most attentive  efficient, friendly, hard working waiter i have ever had in my 30yrs if dining out. The food was very very  good. Corn muffins and biscuits  were warm and delicious, meatloaf was tender and flavorful, greens perfectly cooked and seasoned, mac n cheese, yummolicious,  chicken n dumplings moist and creamy and tender. Country fried steak was thick n juicy. Greaaat overall experience, excellent location, just outside of the Vegas strip, sourh. A must stop before the drive to LA. The nostalgia gift store, is great for last minute souveniers and fun snacks or gifts."}
{"text":"Got a to go order, they said it would be ready in 15 min. So I get there then, pay for it, and proceed to wait 25 more minutes. I asked the worker to make sure everything was hot and fresh since it had been so long, she said it was. I get home 8 minutes later and the fried chicken was no longer crispy and the fries were cold."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I have been to this place but the one thing that stood out for me when I was younger was the gravy and grits. I have to honestly say that most of the food was pretty bland. I was disappointed to say the least. Service was really good though. Everyone was in a great mood."}
{"text":"We don't have Cracker Barrell in CA so we always stop in for some country cookin' while visiting AZ.  Today we learned they changed the menu and removed some of our favorite items.  They added a few menu items that do not compliment their \"country comfort food\" theme.  I guess their executives don't know who their customers are or why people choose their restaurants."}
{"text":"Good ol' Cracker Barrel. This is definitely the place to hit up when you want some comfort food. It's usually packed at this location before 1:00 p.m. on the weekends with an average 10-15 minute wait, but the food is so worth it. My all time favorite is the country fried steak. Old fashioned and just plain tasty. With their main dinner dishes, you also get three sides. With choices like mashed potatoes, steak fries, hash brown casserole, sweet baby carrots, and fried apples, you definitely can't go wrong! You're definitely going to leave her feeling stuffed if you finish your whole plate. 

Their gift shop is also fun to look at while you're waiting. They have tons of old fashioned treats and seasonal decorations. The only slight hassle is having to pay for your food up front which can be annoying when there's already a long line."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We had chicken fried chicken and our choice of 3 sides and there is a wide selection of sides. The fried apples are great, and the mashed potatoes are good too. I liked the sweet potato.....it was good too! Shanelle M was our waitress and we got great service. She was funny....we really liked her. This is a great place to come for comfort food and the service is good and we didn't have to wait long for our food considering how busy they were....I would for sure recommend this place."}
{"text":"My family had no wait times for our table. The servers were very professional and attentative. We didn't have to wait too long for the food either. It came out exactly how we ordered it and was very good. The atmosphere reminded me of the Crackerbarrels I used to eat at with my parents as a kid back on the east coast. Great atmosphere, not too expensive and a staff that is on point. I will be coming back when I get the chance."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We were here for almost 2 hours. Server didn't wait on us for 20 minutes. Finally when we did get help, our order came to the table incomplete, and then got no refills etc. We talked to the manager who was apologetic but did nothing to \"make it right\". Worst Cracker Barrel experience ever. Skip this location if you can!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast.  Seated very quickly and food came out quickly.  The breakfast was as tasty as always.  The only thiing I didn't like was how the server had her thumb all in the food as she passed me my plate.  That totally turned me off.  And she overcharged us and we had to have our bill corrected.  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"We usually love Cracker Barrel!  We are from Idaho and go to Cracker Barrel all the time.  This one was very disappointing!  Our waiter took a while to get our order.  Then, he kept coming back and saying \"I'll be bringing the biscuits and cornbread right out\".  Finally, he came back and said \"Oh, we've had trouble with our oven...but your biscuits and cornbread will be right out.\"  Meanwhile, 3 groups of tables around us (that came in after we did) had the biscuits and cornbread delivered.  Our food finally came, I requested A1 steak sauce and waited...and waited..and waited...someone else finally brought it out to me.  My steak was completely cold.  I couldn't eat it at all.  I took 2 bites and pushed it aside.  The waiter asked if something was wrong...I told him the steak was cold.  He said he would get the manager to take my meal off of our ticket...manager came over and talked to us and apologized...when the waiter brought our ticket he said \"The manager only took off half of your meal!\"  So I was left with paying half of a meal that I only ate the veggies.  That was the most expensive corn I think I've ever eaten!  We will NOT be back...and my sister-in-law (who lives nearby) said she will never return.  So...Cracker Barrel...you've lost more than the cost of 1/2 of a meal..you've lost 3 customers...and probably more, because a lot of our family lives here, and we visit as often as possible."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.

Was just like any other Cracker Barrel. 

The waitress was very polite and helpful.

The food took a little long to arrive. But once it did it was pretty good. 

Would stop again if was in the area."}
{"text":"The customer service here was amazing! I had no problems, my drinks were always full. I never wanted or needed for anything, anytime we needed the waiter was always available. My only regret is that I don't have his name to put on here. It was amazing, the food was good, the desert was good. Everything there was amazing."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel, why have your let your standards decline even further?  Grade of D overall on breakfast.  Dry and tasteless biscuits; sausage flavored with artificial smoke; disgusting glop of gravy. Eggs okay and hash brown casserole marginal.  Not worth the trip."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not memorable.  I'd expected alot more for Southern comfort food with a name of Cracker Barrel.  Chicken fried steak was ok, while biscuits and fried apple didn't seem the home made variety, but alas coffee damn good.  A modest effort on the food vs. the ambiance and docor."}
{"text":"I'm normally not one to complain, however, I just had a breakfast at Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas and it left a lot to be desired. My eggs that I ordered over medium came over hard, my pork chops but which I have eaten at a different Cracker Barrel before and enjoyed very much ,we're very dry. I know this is a new Cracker Barrel and it was very busy but the quality of the food was not up to Cracker Barrel's normal standards."}
{"text":"Been here about hand full of times. My other family members are there a least 3 times a week. Just went to this one yesterday and had very good service... The bold manager that was there was not very friendly at all... I felt like he was making a very hostile work environment for the other servers due to supposably High management there that day reviewing them. You could see the tension on all the servers faces me as a customer felt it also. Seeing him yell at 2 servers that we're walking in to their shift telling them to get to the bathrooms and get themselves ready before they come back to do that in front of customers was very rude I didn't appreciate it there's a place in time you can do that not in front of customers. Our server was also told they couldn't bring a picture of Ice-T to our table due to him being there. There was 8 of us at the table all drinking iced tea made it very difficult for the server to have to come back and refill every time. So service was awesome... Mang made it bad. Food was ok. Stake came out still mooing was asked to be cooked medium rare.."}
{"text":"I was disappointed to find that they didn't have liver and onions. When I put in liver and onions on google when I was looking for that specific dish. Aside from that, service was okay. Food was cold when it got to my table. That's
Good for coleslaw, but when the butter on my baked potato won't melt,or on the corn on my main plate. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"had the baked apples on French toast, scrambled eggs & turkey sausage and all were very good.  server wasn't overly friendly, but by the time we left he was smiling and making jokes.  everyone else was extremely attentive and friendly.  food came out faster than I was expecting for a Saturday morning w/a packed house.  pleasantly surprised and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"There is nothing bad to say about this place it's definitely food that reminds you of your childhood... prices are not bad and it's always fun to look around the store to see all the unique things that they have we waited about 15 min for seating on a Friday night. Service was okay they did take a bit to bring everything out but with time I'm sure it will get better... plus bring a sweater it's so cold in there!!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel serves old fashioned comfort food and sells old fashioned candy and toys in its attached gift shop.   Both are a treat.  They are well known for their chicken and dumplings - you can order them as an entree or as one of the two or three vegetables you get with your entree.  I always order as an entree because they are so good.   Green beans are also good - and on Thursdays sweet potato casserole is one of the many vegetable choices.   The gift shops sells pretty much every old time candy you can think of - this time I bought Clove gum and Mallomars.   We also found old fashioned toys like balloon-powered trains.   All in all, it's fun to eat and shop there.  My only complaint is that they only serve the sweet potato casserole once a week!"}
{"text":"Dont know why I have the best memories of this restaurant. I decide to go for lunch with my mom whos visiting we tried one long time ago the wait was over 2 hours we decide to leave. This time we said well... we are here lets give it a try. Well i tought probably is worth the wait, sadly it wasnt... I ordered a chicken salad which was bland... I could probably make this better at home. Chicken has no flavor, dressing either, also the raspberry tea was awful.... my mom ordered fried shrimp and it was the smallest breaded shrimp  ever.... the batter was on the burnt side and thick no flavor .... we wont come back.  Food is not good at all"}
{"text":"Didn't even get a chance to eat because no one had come to seat us after waiting 6 mins at the host stand. Not a \"someone will be right with you\" or even a greeting. Disappointing because I love Cracker Barrel but I will now drive 20 mins to go to a different one."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here twice but both times the service was great and the food was delicious. American comfort food classics. They have the best homestyle fried chicken I've ever eaten and I'm not even a fan of boneless fried chicken but this is excellent. Highly recommend the country fried chicken as well. That gravy is awesome."}
{"text":"Was very glad to find a Cracker Barrel when passing through Phoenix as it brought back great memories from my childhood in the Midwest/South.

This Cracker Barrel did not disappoint:  the service was great, the food was tasty, the portions were just right.

Upon entering this restaurant we were greeted by friendly staff who made us feel like we were family and that they were glad to see us.  They seemed so genuine because everyone (the server, the receptionist, the cashier, even the bus boy) all greeted us with a warm smile and engaged us in conversation.  We left feeling full and we left feeling valued.

Those who stop by should definitely take the time to peruse the gift store as well:  it is stocked with a variety of unique gift, clothing, and food items (even candies I remembered from the 60s).  

Cracker Barrel is not just a restaurant with an attached gift shop:  it is an experience."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Cracker Barrel! Consistently great service, large portioned food, and at a great price! My hub and I only eat their breakfasts and always leave full and happy. We have tried many breakfast places around town and always end up back at CB. Never change!!"}
{"text":"Food was great and the service by Kenyatta was amazing. Reasonably priced food, nice decor, and the store has the best choices for candy. Everyone is so friendly. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Waste of time. We came about 4 p.m. on Friday with my friend and two 4-year old kids. Waiting area looked ok and we were told it will be 20 min waiting time, so we decided to give it a try. I loved this restaurant's food on East Coast, so was expecting yammy food. By some reason so many people, who arrived far later, passed ahead of us and our waiting time was about an hour! It was sooo loud inside, we barely headr each other, kids were so hungry and tired, so started to cry. We learned menu while waiting, so made an order right when were seated, food arrived after 40-45 min. Food was very average, though, exactly what it cost, so unfortunately we will not come back."}
{"text":"So, it's a Cracker Barrel. Like aaaall the other Cracker Barrels... and lucky for them, I love Cracker Barrel! Yummy food, friendly service, and I always leave feeling like I ate an entire water buffalo. It's pain, but good pain. Maybe I shouldn't eat so much.
(By the way, I love the \"healthy\" options they have now- ham, egg whites, sugar-free syrups, etc!)"}
{"text":"The food is great, always fresh and hot! Staff are always friendly and welcoming! The price is right too! I wish they had a location in Surprise or El mirage, I'd be there everyday!!"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious no matter what you get. The service can be very spotty as far as quickness and attention but are always friendly. It is just amazing how they are always slam packed no matter the time and which location you are at. I credit that to the real fresh made comfort food that is fairly priced with dishes that is hard to find in most restaurants."}
{"text":"Restaurant was crowded but my party of 2 was seated right away. The staff was very friendly. They serve country style food (chicken & dumplings, fried chicken, greens, meatloaf, grits, Mac n cheese, etc.). Very generous food portions. Some of the food is bland tasting so you have to add some seasonings to enhance the flavor. Overall the food was good and reasonably priced. We will be returning."}
{"text":"We were seated right away. There was a little bit of a wait to put in our order but when the waitress Taylor came she was great and knowledgeable about the menu that helped us decide what to get. The food wasn't out very fast but worth the wait and atmosphere was good. Food was really good and very reasonable priced. Will be back here again."}
{"text":"My visit to this establishment wasn't pleasant. The food is not appetizing, but the service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Ironically, this restaurant totally lacks the southern hospitality they claim to represent.  Being vegetarian,  I asked what can I substitute instead of the accompanying \"thick sliced bacon\".  Their response:  an extra biscuit or extra gravy (which is also not vegetarian).  May not substitute potatoes (which turn out to be not vegetarian either).
     I also don't care for grits (sorry...).  What can I substitute for the grits?  Same answer:  a biscuit (about as unhealthy as it gets...), extra gravy (not veg).  May not substitute potatoes (not veg) for the grits.
     Excuse me, but true southern hospitality would give me a little flex on what I order.
     Second, I have been vegetarian for over forty years.  THIS IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MOST VEGETARIAN UNFRIENDLY RESTAURANT I have ever been to.  Steak houses show more flexibility and hospitality than Cracker Barrel.
     Well, I eventually went with the blueberry pancakes.   A little disappointing.   They were cooked at too high a heat so the outside was over cooked.  A bit greasy too.  Geeez...  I would have been better of at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Growing up we used to Cracker Barrel a lot. Even as I got older I remember traveling through Indiana and going to a Cracker Barrel. Moving to Minnesota there used to be a Cracker Barrel not too far from our house that we had visited before they closed. If I remember correctly all of their locations in Minnesota closed.
The one location that we have known over the years that was still open was the Cracker Barrel in Madison. We drive by several times a year when we are traveling south. This evening we were staying in Madison and we all decided to go to Cracker Barrel for dinner. 
One of the memories that we all shared from Cracker Barrel is the shop full of goodies inside and that you can order breakfast all day. Our family loves, loves breakfast so we were pretty excited to check this out.
My nephew ordered the sunrise sampler, I ordered the country boy breakfast, my brother had biscuits and gravy, my wife is weird because she orders chicken fingers EVERYWHERE but we still love her anyways, and my sister in law ordered eggs and bacon. I ordered ham with my country boy and received a couple of very large pieces with my order. We all had grits and biscuits with our meals as well as their famous hash brown casserole. Well our taste buds and memories must have changed. We all felt that our meals were ok. My ham while I had plenty of it was a bit dry and salty. The grits were lacking in flavor and really needed salt and butter. The hash brown casserole was not hot and also just ok. It was just warm. They actually forgot the sausage for my nephew. When we asked about it they did cook it and bring it out right away. Unfortunately it was cooked so much he couldn't even cut it. We were all hungry and did eat our meals, this was just not what we remembered or expected. The meal was good and Cracker Barrel is affordable. They are in a convenient location right off of 90 and provide a good meal at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Being a native Californian-I never knew these existed till I drove from Los Angeles to Charlotte, NC in 2005 and realized they are everywhere!!! I kept seeing these bill boards every few miles and finally decided that I had to try one. Fearing it was something like a \"Waffle House\" which I'd had the misfortune to visit once at 3am, I was prepared to turn and walk out if it was disgusting. My first experience was a pleasant surprise and this location is pretty much the same, in fact, every location is the same, which is a good thing when 
you are on a road  trip and looking for a clean bathroom and somewhere to grab a bite, maybe get some entertainment for the road.

The front entrance is lined with rocking chairs and this location has water misters out there, which is good because the only place I have been that is hotter than Buckeye is Needles, Ca and i think Needles, Ca is right underneath a hole in the Ozone!

Anyway, inside they have a little country store with every kind of candy you can imagine and seasonal cute stuff along with books, toys, gifts and such. The bathrooms are usually way cleaner than you'd find at a truck stop, rest stop or gas station and they have a full service restaurant with a \"down home\" menu. 

Best thing is breakfast all day long and they make great breakfast! 

If you are on the road and looking for a clean, pleasant pit stop. This is a great place to spend some time and re-charge for the road."}
{"text":"Never a problem with this location. The food meets the standard of previous cracker barrels that I've visited and the staff is friendly as well. There is another CB further west but this location is much better."}
{"text":"Eating there made me feel uncomfortable. The waitress was kinda bitchy. I didn't get my side of okra. The elderly, caucasian couple next to us got their food faster than we did. Oh wells. Vegetables were overcooked imo."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Visiting from LA, we were looking for a breakfast spot to quickly eat before we head back as we had a family emergency that we needed to hurry home to. I've heard amazing things about Cracker Barrel, and I was down to try it. 

Seating was quick, BUT we didn't even get to eat. They seated us in the back of the restaurant next to the back door in the corner. We waited 20 mins without any offer of drinks or to take or order. Waitresses and waiters both walking right by us, like we didn't even exist. Made eye contact with what looked like the manager, even raised our hands a couple times and got his attention. But, nothing. It didn't even look like they were concerned. 

Ended up walking out pissed and hungry. Even other patrons noticed and vocalized how long we were waiting with no water or anyone coming to our table. As we walked out, we walked right by the manager - did not make eye contact, no apology or contact. 

It's sad, because I have heard amazing things about this place and now I am skeptical to ever go back."}
{"text":"ARRIVAL : Around 940 I checked in online to make it on the wait list. It said the wait would be 30 mins upon arriving and checking in. Got there 10:20 am checked in and the hostess outside said it would be 15 min wait. 20 mins passed. Asked the hostess inside and said it would be another 10 mins. Another 30 mins passed and we were finally called to be seated. Overall I'd say the 50 min wait was fine compared to the hour and 45 mins the other people had to wait who didn't check in online. However they do need to update the website wait time. The hostess outside was super sweet. The hostess inside, Maka... she was ok, but I sensed her irritated vibes. Understandable considering people checking in were a bit hostile. Not everyone but there were a few that I seen. Though she could of put a smile on here face since she is the first person we interact with. 
* My tip would be is to arrive early say 6 or 7 to avoid the crazy wait * 

FOOD : *We ordered our food at 11:10 and got our food at 11:40*
Anywhere I dine for breakfast I usually tend to get either eggs Benedict or country fried steak. So when I saw Grandpa's Country fried breakfast I knew had to get it. My dish overall was pretty good. Although I do feel like the gravy needed some sprucing up and it lacked a little flavor. The fried steak was good but that also needed some seasoning. Grits were yummy. The fried apples ... mmm... the fried apples! If fall had a flavor, that bowl of fried apples would be it! The apple butter was divine on the biscuits. My husband got The Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast w/ steak. His steak was cooked perfectly. He really enjoyed his meal. We got our boys blueberry pancakes that came with blueberry syrup. They devoured them. 


OVERALL ... Everything was good minus the wait for seating and food. I feel once the hype of cracker barrel finally being in Vegas dies down we would come back to dine. We love the store part of the restaurant! So many good finds there! Old school candy, games, home decor. I can go on and on. I really recommend the store to anyone who adores anything country chic stuff. I'd also like to point out that the employees there are tremendously kind. Minus the hostess inside i mentioned before."}
{"text":"Food was great. Did not have to wait long to be seated. Our Sever Julian was awesome. Great customer service by our server Julian. Thank you"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast. Our server Amanda was great. Her customer service was impeccable & took the initiative to take care of our table & party. She made our experience at Cracker Barrell fun with her awesome personality. Thank you Amanda for your 5 star customer service! Oh and also, food is always great at Cracker Bearrel"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely hopping tonight! Everyone loves Cracker Barrel and we're showing the love. Porkchop special for me with coleslaw and greens while the kids are going in every direction... A perfect family meal!"}
{"text":"3 hours after breakfast, i'm still paralyzed in bed and too lazy to get up and check what those things we bought were. Not sure, what they're called, but it's like a candy cane basically, a thin stick I think? We bought 8 of those for $1 after our meal, it was supposed to be 20 cents each. But anyways, you get there, and there are a bunch of rocking chairs for you to sit on and play a game of giant checkers, and you can even buy a rocking chair if you'd like.

You get in and, like other reviews, it really is like a gift shop, and then you walk into the back which is a HUGE and clean restaurant that has a great atmosphere and seats plenty. We immediately got our table for two and I ordered the Country Fried Steak Breakfast platter that also came with 2 eggs cooked by my choice, 2 biscuits with gravy, grit (which was sort of plain, but I threw some gravy in to try to make it better, it was my first time trying grit), and hash brown casserole. ALL THAT FOR $7.99!? What the hell, I've never seen a price that great for that much food. My brother got something similar and then ordered a side of sausage patties, which went perfect with my biscuits. I got my order and the first thing I did was make a sausage mcmuffin, the country fried steak was good and so was the casserole, though it coulda been hotter and crispier, but it was still great.

Great food, great price, great service. I won't be eating for another 5 hours probably. Food Coma time, goodnight!"}
{"text":"Food is always good but Melissa did not greet us until 15 mins later until the hostess had to get her. 

Grits is always good and bacon was good."}
{"text":"I have a gluten allergy and I asked for my meal without grits and to substitute anything in its place like fruit or extra bacon or cheap eggs. The server was extremely rude when I told her about my allergy and told me that she couldn't substitute anything. I felt like she didn't give a shit about her job. 
Basically reminded me that I shouldn't be eating anything at Cracker Barrel again. Will not be returning to any Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Went out for dinner the day before Christmas and found a 15 to 20 minute wait to get in. After 15 minutes we got in we're seated and within about 15 to 20 minutes we had our food. Good food, good price, will be back again. Oh, and Olivia was a gem."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Cracker Barrel and it did not disappoint! From the cute old country store when you walk in, to the kind and hospitable wait staff, to the delicious home cooked food! We were greeted by the manager on duty and told him it was our first time and he was kind enough to bring us a small portion of chicken and gravy to taste. Our server was Gabriel (I think?) he was so friendly and attentive even though it was a busy evening. Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"ZERO complaints over 15 years and dozens of locations across the US. Was looking for that southern comfort warm and fuzzy feeling.

BUT IT WAS NOT HERE

After the first waitress was unfamiliar with the new menu items (not too terrible)... another person brought the food out and slammed down every item onto the table, and to the wrong person despite my reaction and attempt to move them over to my girlfriend... lucky guess she got the childs order to the right spot. Then got attitude like we had done something wrong like switched seats or something.

Did not get all items out at once, which made my plate look stupid because it was only half full. In addition to giving the wrong plates out, since it was a different person we didn't get the requested ranch dressing until prompted with an attitude 'do ya need anything else?'

The ranch was brought out by the initial waitress and the check dropped off... kinda early? And we were never spoken to again! We sucked all first round drinks dry, left food on the table... especially our 4 year olds uncooked pink hamburger which had 0% chance of being rectified because we no longer existed to anyone.

AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE NEVER TIPPED.

I've always left SOMETHING to at least reflect the performance of someone on the staff, but I have nothing good to say about this visit. The cashier asked how everything was, but was clearly unequipped to handle a negative reaction. I didn't spill the whole scoop, merely shared my disappointment to no empathy or effort to make resolution. So I paid cash and took my change, leaving nothing and heading straight for the exit.

I feel bad for how a couple people representing an entire nation wide chain can impact a faithful customer in such a way, and the reaction they forced out of me to leave no $$. Sadly it's true that bad service can ruin everything, the food didn't taste right, there was no warm fuzzy comforting feeling, and I looked at and bought nothing in the shop out front. Sad day, it was a very sad day but due to a great record in the past I can't hit the 1 star. 

Better luck next time CB but it will probably be a long time because I dont want to risk another awful experience when Im looking for something that should feel familiar."}
{"text":"Blech...why is this place so crowded and popular? Went there on the invite of friends. Crowded and busy it was, but was it worth the 30 minute wait? I ordered what should have been simple: eggs over easy and bacon. Cook didn't get it right - how hard is it to do eggs over easy. Well, they were overcooked. The eggs were obviously cooked together and separated with a knife. The yolks were medium hard. The worse thing was to come: biscuit and gravy. The biscuit had an overwhelming baking powder taste. The \"gravy\" was disgusting. A thick, gloppy mixture of water and flour with some salt for seasoning an a few bits of sausage. It was inedible. Just gross. The coffee, while abundant, was thin and a pale imitation of real coffee. But the other customers just ate it all up like this is some 5-star joint. It's lousy, poorly cooked garbage. There are some places in town that do breakfast so well, and make real homemade biscuits and gravy. And some of the customers at CB are so effing fat - I mean whales! The probably eat there too often - the processed food and starch shows on their guts. Go elsewhere. Cracker Barrel needs to completely revamp its product. BTW, waitress was great and the shop out front interesting, especially if you like Christmas when Halloween hasn't even arrived."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Cracker Barrel and although my friend was raving about it- I'm not sure I felt the same. Everyone is super friendly but I'm afraid I'm not crazy about it. 
Upon entering we were greeted immediately and we put in our names for a table. The waiting area is a gift shop so its nice since you can browse and be occupied while waiting. We did't wait long at all- not more than 5 minutes!
I ordered the Cracker Barrel Sampler, since I was a bit overwhelmed with the menu. It came with chicken n' dumplins, meat loaf, and your choice of sugar cured or country ham. I opted for the country ham and also got buttermilk biscuits on the side. Our friend ordered corn bread for their side and it took a while to come out since they were baking- but still nothing amazing. I wasn't crazy about the dumplins. It had gravy over it but I felt like I never got a bite of chicken. Just the soft dumplins. Then the meatloaf was okay but underwhelming whilst the ham was a bit salty. 
Overall, the food was quite subpar. I most likely won't return- not really my cup of tea. I love comfort food but this did not hit the spot."}
{"text":"Dear Cracker Barrel,

Where have you been all my life? 
Love,
Jen

This has got to be one of the best finds in a long long time. I've been told that they don't exist in CA so I had the pleasure of dining here on a work trip. Talk about good ole home cooked meals with a southern taste. This place not only has fantastic and affordable dishes but they are delish. Their service was impeccable and I had such a great time wandering the fun lobby filled with candy and toys from back in the day. If you love comfort food don't pass up this place."}
{"text":"This location doesn't seem to be up to par with other Cracker Barrels. They seem to have only one or two harried waitresses working when there are large crowds of people. On a Thursday evening we were told that the wait would be at least 40 min and this was after waiting a long time to put our order in. Apparently they had several call in orders that left the kitchen backed up. After seeing the waitress apologize about the wait to several other tables we decided to try dinner somewhere else before we put our order in. I have tried the Coca cola cake here before and I agree with other yelpers that its just not what it used to be. 

They still have the store side which carries all of the usual Cracker Barrel items if you want to stop and shop."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is still a decent place to eat but not nearly as good as it was two decades ago.  It used to be standard operating procedure that the biscuits and corn muffins would be replenished without asking.  Now patrons have to request a refill from their server.  Items such as the veggies have remained consistent.  Their Crispy Country Buttermilk Chicken was tender and tasty but the potion of chicken amounted the size of a couple of saltine size, square patties.  One piece was nearly one fourth breading over fat.  I'll give Cracker Barrel credit for creativity with their honey pepper sauce but I still haven't forgiven their bean counters and their marketing department for the underhanded way they switched their signature, 100% maple syrup with inferior sugar syrup.  Shame, shame!

Our waitress was very friendly and overall attentive.

Though Cracker Barrel excels over many other fast-food type of restaurants, value for the money is slightly below average."}
{"text":"Very busy and noise but it only took 20 mins to get seated. Server took our order pretty quick, but it took 20 mins to get a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"I'm not a breakfast person it's usually my least favorite meal and I don't usually mind skipping it......but this place makes me LOVE breakfast. Great food great service and not over priced and I love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"my wife has always talked about this restaurant and when we saw one on a road trip we stopped for dinner. The fried chicken was great, and I loved there was no bone. The hashbrown casserole was pretty good to boot. It was full of old timers. The younger folks are missing out."}
{"text":"Greatselection of breakfast foods, southern style, and great service"}
{"text":"Note~~ 2 stars regarding this experience ONLY. Other times have been great service/food. 

My mother and I ate here last night after a very long day of not eating and volunteer work. First of all, it took us 10 minutes to be sat. The cashier (Paige) was AMAZING. She was very tentative to us and made sure someone eventually came, after numerous times of trying to 'radio' a hostess in.

When we finally got seated, our server was not very personable and seemed like she just wanted to leave. She got our drinks and everything in a little more than average time, but seemed quite careless. We also felt she rushed the check on us as she proceeded to clean her section, provoking me to ask for a box. 

Now the food. mind you we came in an hour and a half before close so there was no need for the half-ass meal. My country fried steak had a film over the gravy, Mac n cheese was cold and stale, and my mashed potatoes consisted of about 2 and a half spoon fulls. Not to mention it was quite apparent I got the last of the friend apples. Now I understand people wanted to get out of here as it as approaching close (still had an hour) but that was just a terrible experience with service, food, and portions. If it wasn't for the amazing customer service from your cashier and her sincerity, I may have complained at the store. You should be treated and served the same at all hours of the day, regarding the time. I found this was a total waste of my money. I will return, but defiantly not at this time of the day and will be sure to notify my friends and family of this terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food was good but was delish with great service. Just wanted to rave about a waitress at this Cracker Barrel. Her name is Ashley and she is the best server I have ever had. I am from out of state here for a soccer tournament and my family had her the first day we arrived here in AZ, which we told her all about. Two days later we came for lunch and requested her but she was busy. BUT she noticed us eating and came to ask us about the results of the tournament and asked how we were. It felt amazing for a server to take so much care in customer service to remember us after just ONE visit. If I had a company in AZ she would be someone I would want to work for me. 
If my family and I lived here I would come back to this location just for Ashley!"}
{"text":"Same menu so the only thing you can review a CB on is service.  Service was great in this store.   Glasses of tea always full, food was lightening quick, and al around very good.  THANKS CB."}
{"text":"I love this location and will be sad when we move to Cornelius. They are always so friendly and hospitable, just like you're walking into their own home. Even when I have a major blonde moment and spill my sweet tea all over the place, they still smile and laugh. The chicken and dumplings are beyond amazing and are the perfect cure for a cold winter night!"}
{"text":"The good- booking online, so 30 minute wait became 5. And the servers were attentive and friendly...The bad - the food...over easy eggs a little bigger than a half dollar (same size as dried out and thin sausage patties) ...2 spoonfuls of hash brown casserole ( keep the casserole and just do hash browns) and tasteless gravy and grits...1/3 portions of Black Bear Diner...Denny's is better at half the price... not big on \"plating\" but minimal is the style here...didn't look appealing and it wasn't... will check out store again but not the restaurant"}
{"text":"I eat a Cracker Barrel all over and never had any problem except the one here in Las Vegas on Craig road. I like to have my eggs country scramble but was told that don't do that and don't know what that is. After explaining what country is I was told that they don't do that because they crack and beat there eggs for the hold day. So they are not fresh made but for the hold day. they offer fried eggs and that is the way you make country scramble. To many other issues with service maybe in time they will get it for now I will be going to other locations."}
{"text":"Greeted in true fashion. I absolutely adore this chain! The atmosphere is most always charming and the food is consistently good. 

Our server, Nate,  was kind with deliverable expertise. The food was prepared nicely, and prompt. Only tiny complaint...the tea was not brewed strong and dark. My specific preference, obviously. 

All in all a wonderful visit that kept up traditional tones when dining at Cracker Barrel. I will continue to visit this one and all the rest in the future!"}
{"text":"I was super excited to eat here, but the experience was just so-so. Our server was great, and the food was great. But man... the people running the store were a bit rude and condescending. It was also incredibly crowded. I suppose that should be expected. But over all the experience was just average. Too bad. Maybe in time it will get better."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel.

Anyplace.  anywhere.

They served my to go dish quickly, but they forgot to add the muffins :-(  That's ok.  Cracker Barrel is great :-)"}
{"text":"So I had dinner on Sunday at 6:00pm...no wait...very busy but I had a great waiter and delicious food. The Sunday chicken is a 10+...loved it. The manager stopped by to check on the status of my meal and satisfaction with my experience. It was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the prices, the food, their biscuits - oh jeeze!! I love the consistency with in this company! Great place, dinner- fried chicken or blackened catfish is my fav. I love the specials too! Breakfast is my favorite at any meal. All is so so good!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here just after opening on a Sunday morning during a layover to Savannah. My first time to a Cracker Barrel and the service was very quick and friendly. I ordered Uncle Hershel's Favorite breakfast and was satisfying. The biscuits are obviously baked fresh and the coffee was very good. Decor and music were pleasing and the rocking chairs on the porch were quite comfortable."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated store for the Holiday Season. Good food in the restaurant which is attached to the store. Very good down home food at reasonable prices. We really & truly enjoyed the food & shopping afterwards. The restaurant has food for the person who is carb conscious. I think that is a plus right there because of so many people that have diabetes & heart problems. I also think if is very thoughful of the restaurant to think of people on diets of some sort. Good salads,chicken,fish & whatever you so desire to eat or feel like. You can order breakfast food at anytime of the day, which is also nice to know. The store has a good variety of things to choose from including  candy,apparel,toys,& anything else that you might want to purchase. This was not our first time there. We have had wonderful tasting chicken in Indianapolis IN. My husband says that he thinks that Indianapolis had the best chicken, good coating on the skin & very juicy. We had Darrahde as a waitress, & she is a very nice,sweet lady that will help you out with any questions or bend over backwards to help you. She is one of the best waitress that we have had in a long time. You can't go wrong with this restaurant or store."}
{"text":"Probably out of all the places we ate at on vay-cay this was probably one of my favorite destinations. Right as we pull up the restaurant had a real vintage feel and life to it. Alongside the metal advertising signs and bottled soda in the general store it also contained a genuine wooden porch, complete with big wooden planks, rocking chairs, and cracker barrel's (obviously) 

We put our name's on the list and proceeded to take a look around their store, it was a really interesting range of merchandise from all american apparel (trust me I felt really patriotic there), to toys for the kids, and ASU apparel for the college kids. 

We sat down and took a look at the menu, everyone in my group kept telling me how great their Chicken & Dumplings were but I figured everyone was gonna order it so I could always try it from their plates. I decided to go with the Chicken-Fried Steak  (which came with 3 sides holy crap), sided with: Mashed w/ Brown Gravy, Mac'n'cheese, and Steak Fries. 

When the food came out I noticed my Chicken-Fried Steak was about 60% of the plate.....like disgustingly huge. The sides were a little on the slim side but then again I had 3 of em. A side of cornbread and biscuits & gravy were also provided for us. The steak was a little overdone in my opinion, don't get me wrong it had great flavor but it was a little too crispy for my taste. The mashed w/ brown gravy was tasty. The mac was pretty solid, but the steak fries were bland......had to use quite a bit of ketchup for those.

However the biscuits were super delicious, really fresh and puffy on the inside with a slight hardened outside, dunked with the white sausage gravy and life was good :) I also had a bite of my buddies Chicken & Dumplings which honestly tasted really close to a home made casserole and the chicken was a bit dry, guess I'm glad I didn't order it :) I guess I missed out on their breakfast menu so I'm definitely going to have to try out their breakfast next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of those places I would  try and live at if they let me.
I live in California, so I have to cross state lines to get to one, but we do it.
It's just that good.
The lumberjack breakfast is one of the best country style breakfasts I've had hands-down.
This is a great place to go in a large group, and we often do."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Cracker Barrel experiences I have ever had. The staff was so friendly, we literally felt like we were right at home, even though were were states away. 
It started with the Manager, Ken, who immediately greeted our family of 5 (with 3 girls from 1-6 years old) and got us seated right away. He was so friendly, outgoing, and personable - my girls just kept staring at him because he was so nice. 
While seated, we had an excellent waitress, Treva, who was again very sweet and talkative with our family. She even changed our order around to get us the same food and same amounts, but ordering differently to save us money. 
Also while seated, another waiter, Mark, kept interacting with our young children and playing with them with toys from the store. He was just great interacting with our kids even though we weren't \"his\" to take care of. 
The food was great and quick, as a typical Cracker Barrel is, but the staff here made my experience top notch."}
{"text":"Maybe because my families Southern, maybe l just like old timey but whatever it is, l just love any Cracker Barrel!  Wish they would open in CA!  Get breakfast no matter the hour and split the plate unless you want to be as big as some of their regulars!"}
{"text":"Although I usually like the food and atmosphere at Cracker Barrel, this visit with my wife and daughter did not end well.
I had the country fried steak dinner, with greens, Mac and cheese, and okra. The flavor was great, but within an hour after leaving the restaurant, I was hit with some serious food poisoning. Luckily, neither my wife or daughter ended up ill, but I am dealing with the after effects today with severe abdominal pain and most of my day spent in the lavatory.

Never again."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is always a safe bet for the family and myself. Service is usually great, food quality is good, and price is right. 

I've been to many different CB locations throughout the US. And the buckeye location is average in service."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Cracker Barrel, my first intro to it was back in Roanoke, Virginia where I had the chicken fried chicken, and had their fried apples. I really like their fried apples coz it reminds me of the wholesome, and slightly sweetish tart of an apple pie filling. 

Anywho, recently went to brunch at the Cracker Barrel and ordered the Country Boy Special, an $8.99 deal with 3 eggs, a choice of country ham, pork chops or sirloin steak. I chose the pork chops. It also comes with the hashbrown cake, fried apples, grits, gravy and two biscuits. A whole lotta food but worth the deliciousness and calories. 

I have to admit their pork chops are tender and yum, I've always heard good things about the pork chops in the past. Apart from that liked the gravy and their soft and warm buttermilk biscuits. I was stuffed, and had to take home my fried apples which i do love alone or with some vanilla ice cream, the perfect afternoon treat! Overall, if you'd like yum country food, this place is good even for a chain!

Oh and depending on the month, ask if they have their awesome coca cola chocolate cake... it's YUM!"}
{"text":"Excellent service made for such an enjoyable breakfast this morning. I had the pumpkin spice pancake combo which was plentiful and so delicious! I Highly recommend this cracker battle for its cleanliness and five star service. Browsing through the country store is an added bonus, you can find unique gifts."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there this morning and really enjoyed it. Great food, but a little hard to find."}
{"text":"Typically, I am not a Cracker Barrel fan. This location changed my mind!

The server was fantastic. He was super nice and extremely attentive. The food was better than any Cracker Barrel I've ever been to. I usually find their biscuits to be dry, but these biscuits were amazing! Maybe I was so hungry from travelling all day that average food tasted wonderful, but I honestly think they just have really good cooks at this location. I even saw an employee cleaning the already clean bathroom! That makes me feel good about sanitization, for sure! If I am ever looking for a Cracker Barrel in this area again, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, but we don't have it in my state.  I was delighted to find it in Las Vegas because I visit relatively often.  That being said, this location is not nearly as good as the locations I visited while living in Florida.  I still make the trip out for the Sunday chicken dinners though.  I always have to get the hashbrown casserole.  Beware the candy sticks labeling though.  When they run out of a certain flavor, they fill it up with a different flavor but keep the original label.  Ex. Last time I went they had run out of watermelon.  I didn't realize until I got home they replaced watermelon with bubblegum but kept the watermelon tag on it.  I was bummed to end up with 5 bubblegums when I thought it was watermelon."}
{"text":"Wife and I have been here a couple of times and have even picked up food 2 go.  The food is consistently good.  Sunday night fried chicken special is really good.  Add a pancake and it's awesome (Jasmine our waitress suggested this and it was really good).  You should really try the country ham and hash brown casserole."}
{"text":"The food is okay and portions are big, but it's the blandest place I've ever eaten. I'm sure this is due to the mostly senior clientele."}
{"text":"I had never been to Cracker Barrel before so this was my first one. Of course I was in love with the rocking chairs on the porch and the store that has so many adorable items- although all ridiculously over priced. 

I was trying to be healthy so I got the salad. It was average but the Cesar dressing was quite good. I also had the fried apples, which were delicious - like the center of an apple pie, not at all breaded. I also had the kale and Brussels side, which was small but delicious. 

The breakfast meals come with warm syrup which is a nice touch. And for two meals and two sides and drinks it was under $30 which is a steal. I'd return, and it's certainly possible I ordered wrong (so I've been told) but not sure I get the hype of this chain."}
{"text":"Heading back home and there is nothing like a Cracker Barrel breakfast to set us on our way.  We arrived early and to our surprise welcomed at the door and then greeted by Chris who set us, got our coffees and our orders and then brought us our food...Amazing"}
{"text":"The line is ridiculously long. Wait is average 1.5 hours it's a complete cluster-Fk inside. The people are nice and helpful but very disorganized. I will wait a few more months before I attempt to dine in. We opt for a carry out. The server that took our order saw that we were a bit irritated already for the previous guys telling us to go in 4 different lines to place an order so he was extremely attentive and nice. Our order came out in a or 25mins. The food was extremely dry and bland. We ordered 2 chicken dumplings with sides and country fried steak. Biscuits and corn bread were dried out to the point where it gets stuck to your throat when you try to swallow it. The portion of chicken and dumplings was half the size it usually is in the Midwest locations that I'm use to. Definitely wait a couple months before coming to this spot."}
{"text":"My first visit. I ordered chicken and dumplings with fried okra and country green beans. The fried okra was fine. The green beans didn't have much flavor and the chicken and dumplings were disappointing. Our waiter was exceptional, but the main thing you go to a restaurant for is the food. Probably my last visit."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on Father's Day morning. I'll give two stars for the service and coffee. The quality and portions of the food doesn't deserve one star. I wanted an omelette. They don't do omelettes. What? Really? I ordered the \"old timers breakfast\". A young boy could eat that and leave the table hungry. Eggs weren't cooked as I ordered. Biscuits were small and hard as rocks. Gravy was cold. Total crap....way overpriced for what you get. I've eaten at Cracker Barrel all around the country. This is the worst. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I seriously had the best waiter last Sunday and need to give 5 stars! The customer service was hands down the best I have had in years! He was so super patient and got down at eye level when listening to my mom making her different requests. I love this place, good food and the shop is always entertaining! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Alright you guys. If you haven't been here yet, go check it out. I've had a lot of complaints when I was working here so I found different employment but I'm not going to bash anything about them on here. The food is very good, depending on what you get. I was born and raised in Vegas and I've heard of Cracker Barrel but never expierenced the food or the \"southern comfort\" as we called it. This location first opened up back in October of 2016 and the food has come a LONG way since then. Our cooks have become more defined with their skills and our servers have gotten a lot better with the menu choices and how to treat our guests, you guys.! Of course I understand all of you guys are used to other Cracker Barrel's across the United States and call yourself \"experts\" but you probably don't remember what it was like when a chain FIRST opened up. That's what you had to do for our 2815 E. Craig Road location. When I left, as far as I was aware of, we were the ONLY store to do the Online Check In and yes it was not only a beta test but a hassle all the way around. But just like anything that is a beta test, it takes time to get to know and understand the system. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do have a problem, speak up and say something to the server or cashier that is assisting you.. Our job is to correct your expierence so you WANT to come back. If you don't want to talk to us and tell us what's going on because you have a bone to pick with us, at least tell us so we can get a manager involved so they can do something to help you. How are we supposed to give you that Southern Hospitality like our sister stores if you don't communicate with us..? Our Silverton location has been opened since July of 2016, so not much longer than us. And we even heard from guests that they didn't like their food when they first opened.! Just give us a chance and communicate with us. We want you to come back and to tell your friends about us."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning and had to wait only about 20 mins.  Service was horrible. We asked for refills on soda and the waiter kept saying ok one minute. Let's just say it was the longest minute as we never received refill. Also asked for hot sauce, again waiter said I'll bring it right back. All he brought back was the bill. I guess since it is open for a few weeks the staff rather get you in and out instead of making sure you'd want to come back. Not worth the wait or drive there."}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Cracker Barrel for over a decade. From Arizona, New Mexico, and Ohio. I am pleased to say the First Las Vegas, NV location didn't disappoint. I needed some comfort after a tough couple few weeks and I've been looking forward to the grand opening. Six days open and the wait was really long. We got there at 5pm and weren't seated till 6:15pm. I expected a wait but this was a little extreme. Luckily my six year old and I did a little shopping in there country store something we always enjoy. However due to the tremendous wait it was practically shoulder to shoulder in the store. We purchased a few goodies and there was a zero wait for the cashier who were all very pleasant and accommodating. By the time we sat we were hungry. Our server Julian was hands down exceptional. I have been a server for many years in my life and I know how a hectic environment like that can be draining and effect your behavior. However this man was a pro and he had such a wonderful positive demeanor. You knew he was slammed but he made sure our drinks were always full and we had everything we needed for an enjoyable dinner. The food was delicious they did run out of mashed potatoes; but as soon as they were ready Julian hustled them out to me, and they were piping hot and yummy. I made a point to compliment our server to the manager when he came over to check on our table. This is also why I emphasize his name. It is extremely rare especially in Las Vegas to receive such superior customer service from a server at a restaurant of this caliber. The next time we go back I'll definitely ask to sit in his section. We look forward to returning and hope the next time the wait won't exceed an hour but again understandable for it being the first week."}
{"text":"The service was great hence the 2 stars but the food not so much.  The \"meat\"loaf seemed a bit raw except for the outer edge and I put meat in quotes because I'm not too sure how much actual meat was in it. Needless to say, for me I found it to be inedible and was left on my plate.  The corn muffin was dry and tasteless lacking that sweet cornbread flavor.  The waitress must have known because she brought us some apple butter to go with them.  I mistakenly ordered the cornbread stuffing (wish I had the muffin before I ordered) because it too was very dry and crumbly.  Thankfully the corn and mashed potatoes were okay.  Now the little Country Store connected to the restaurant is another story; it is fun to check out all the old school candy."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dessert when I was staying in Westlake.  The apple dumplin was great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible meal. Probably worst of my life. THAT is considered thick bacon?! Lucille's biscuits are FAR better. The people are awesome and it's cute and we didn't wait but if you want quality food this is NOT the place!"}
{"text":"Great service and great waiters and waitresses every time we come. They know our orders by heart."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed the experience every time. I've only gone for breakfast.

Staff is always nice and accommodating.

Here's what I've had and how I feel:

Biscuits & Gravy: Delicious.
Hashbrown Casserole: Also delicious.
Fried Apples: Taste like your typical fried apples, which means it's delicious.
Country Fried Steak: Cooked well, crispy, and the added gravy makes the dish
Country Fried Chicken: Just as good as the country fried steak
Eggs: I mean, eggs are eggs. Just order them how you like. 
Steak: Cooked well. I'm picky with my steak so the fact that we paid the cheap price for this steak and I enjoyed it, means something.

Apple cider in a Frozen mug: Get this EVERYTIME. Breakfast, lunch or dinner. It's refreshing and works great with any meal.


Disclaimer: I may have been hungover or beyond ravenous upon my visits here, so this review may be a bit exaggerated.

All in all, it's a great, decently priced breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of people talk about how they love the Cracker Barrel, but in all honesty it was not that great. I really did like the feel of the place though. Customer service was horrible, and the food was honestly ehhhh. 
I ordered eggs, bacon, sausage  and biscuits with gravy. The bacon was burnt, and the sausage was gross and beef jerky like. The only thing that was pretty good was the biscuits. 
I have definitely had better breakfast in town. 
I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. There might be better locations in the country, but this Las Vegas location sucks. 
Spend your money else where, or make your food at home, it'll probably be a lot better.  Plus it's way to loud in the restaurant to even hear yourself think. 

Oh and I asked my server for a side of butter, and he grabbed someone else's and gave me theirs! Like i don't know about you, but that was a little weird."}
{"text":"Terrible Service. Had a party of ten, waited 35 minutes. Watched them put the number 10 in the wait list. Then tried to say we only had six when we clearly had 10. Then wanted to split us up into two
Groups, when we came with family from out of town and we're leaving right after the meal. When we didn't want to split up the party, they said it was gonna be ANOTHER 35 minutes. Awful. Don't come here."}
{"text":"It's not a great place to have breakfast with family. Nothing spectacular , food is not great ."}
{"text":"Man the food and service was awesome.  Ordered the ribeye steak.  and tasted so good."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with Cracker Barrel. I was actually disappointed after all the hype I had heard from friends and family. 

The only thing that I would say was delicious was the southern green beans. The part I loved the most was the gift shop which had the coolest decorations ever and really awesome old fashioned soda pop and candy. A nice touch was the golf tee game on the table which kept my mind busy as I waited for my food. 

On the down side the service was mediocre, the wait was ridiculous, the biscuits I had heard which were flaky and homemade were dry, the grits needed more flavor and salt, and lastly portions left me hungry. 

I'm going to come back again and just make sure it want an off day."}
{"text":"We got there at 9 am with 8 people. We didn't get sat down until 10:30 am. We waited another 30 minutes for someone to take our drink order, then  another 20 minutes for our food order to be taken
 We finally got our cold, died out, little portions of food at 11:50 am. Worst service and food I have ever had at a Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"This is the best place for breakfast! The prices are reasonable, the portions are big, and the food is delicious! The hash brown casserole is a must! Their Country Boy breakfast is enough food to appease any large appetite. There are many options and they are flexible with substitutes. I always get the Country Boy with steak. It's the best steak and egg breakfast you can get in the valley for the price. The only negative I can think of is that the wait can be long at times but you can browse thier little country store while you wait. However, if you go at the right time you can get seated right away."}
{"text":"Just like mama's cooking except faster and more convenient! Reasonably priced, high quality ingredients, made with love!!!!"}
{"text":"This is about the 10th time we have been here. So I cannot believe that I have never written  a review, so time's a wasting.
Every time we have ever come here it has been really good. 
For starters Hot Tea and Ice Tea are only $1.99. That is a good price. Every where else we have gone lately it has been $3.00 or more.
The food is really good!  Every single time. We ordered dinner and it was pretty busy being Friday night.
Every thing was good and came out very fast. Steak was cooked perfecty and The Rainbow Trout was really good, it even still has the skin on it. So it was really moist.

Prices are super great here and service is always good. 
The food is a lot , and it tastes great!
We really like the little store in front as well. They already had the Halloween stuff out for sale. 
Halloween is only 3 months away."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to my first visit to the Cracker Barrel. We arrived Friday night at 5:30 and were surprised we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated, but that wasn't so bad. My first impression when I entered the dining room was that it was like a school cafeteria with rows of long tables. Turns out there are separate tables but jammed so tightly together there's barely room to walk.
     What impressed me the most was the horrendous noise. We couldn't talk, we had to shout  at each other. With wooden floors and wooden ceilings there's obviously no effort made to reduce the sound. This is a brand new building, and you would think that whoever designed it would have considered the noise and crowding factors, but apparently not. Seems the plan was to jam as many people in the dining room as possible and forget about comfort. If you're looking for charming ambiance and \"a fine dining experience,\" do not go here.
     I liked my chicken fried chicken, and our waitress was fine. We didn't have to wait very long for our food, and it was warm upon arrival, but because of the noise, we'll never go back."}
{"text":"My ABSOLUTE favorite.

Came all the way from LA CA just to have some delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"My spouse was excited as we approached Cracker Barrel on our drive, and what we found was classic, stick-to-your-ribs foods, served nicely, but not particularly exciting.  The food was good, it wasn't great."}
{"text":"My wife and I try to get to Cracker Barrel whenever we are in Arizona or New Mexico.  The blueberry pancakes and the hashbrown casserole are a must for breakfast.

We have had lunch and dinner here also and the food never disappoints.  Be prepared to wait a while to get seated on Sunday mornings since this place gets packed."}
{"text":"Ok, if you know me you know that I am willing to drive outta state for food. The first time I had Cracker Barrel was in St. George, Utah. I've been hooked ever since. I was so excited to hear that they were opening here in Vegas. Since I don't review off of one time I'm reviewing off of multiple visits to this location since they have opened. 
My first experience was not so great. (They made it right, right away too.) But every time since then has been amazing! Great staff and service, most of the time. The food isn't as always consistently the same but it's still delicious!! My favorites are the hashbrown casserole and chicken n' dumplings. My boyfriend got me to try the greens and I'm so glad he did tender and cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"I generally love Cracker Barrel. This one had a musty smell. The young man that seated us was very pleasant and extremely nice.  
Our Waitress must have had a bad day.  Never brought out part of the order after numerous reminders and stating she would.  Got a couple of orders wrong. One completely wrong.  The overcharged us.  Even with that service was slow.  To make matters worse this was the least busy Cracker Barrel I have been  visited in forever. May there is a reason."}
{"text":"Great place just the parking is really bad I think the guest at the hotel uses the lot to park 
As well"}
{"text":"I've always liked this restaurant, and I go there sometimes for comfort food. The food is usually very very consistent. I especially like the fried chicken breasts on Sundays.  

Today however I was a bit disappointed. The food was average at best. I had the chicken and dumplings and my partner had the turkey with dressing. The turkey was very dry. The chicken and dumplings was excellent. But my biggest problem overall was how slow the service was.  it took them a long time to find us a seat, and it wasn't because there were too many people there.  We had to ask for drink refills about three times. The beef stew soup was really bad. Just didn't have any flavor.

What I still come here? Yes I probably would. But I don't have high expectations anymore."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst breakfasts we've ever had. Everything was cold. The service was terrible. Had to ask 3 times just for water. The biscuits didn't come with the fixings and when we asked for them...twice...they never came. I almost choked on an apple stem that was baked in my apples and my mom found some plastic substance in hers. Needless to say we will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The customer service is outstanding and the food is actually really good close to homemade! Will def be a to go regular!"}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast.   Had good service and the people were very friendly.    Always have good old fashioned food.  Love the breakfast menu"}
{"text":"Do not come here unless you like hair in your food, inattentive servers, and food that will make you feel sick!!!

I came here this morning with my sister and my mom. We were excited to come here because there's finally a Cracker Barrel in Vegas. 

There was no wait time since it was an early Monday morning. We had no problems with the service until our food arrived. There was a long hair in our biscuits so we notified a server passing by right away. All he could say was, \"Ew, that's nasty!\" and took the plate away. The manager came by to check on us after that but there was no apology from him. Shortly after our food arrived, our waitress, Michaela, gave us our check and that was the last time we saw her. My family and I were waiting on a to-go order that was taking forever. We also wanted drink refills and to-go boxes, but we never received those. 

Another waitress told us that she would grab our server, but she still never arrived until the very end with our to-go order. Just because you gave us our check at the start of our meal does not mean that you shouldn't tend to us for the rest of our visit. I believe no one showed up because they were embarrassed about the hair in our biscuits. 

Not only did our service end up being horrible, but my family and I felt very sick after our meal. It wasn't just one of us - ALL of us felt ill! Unfortunately this is the last time I will ever visit Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Good ol country food. They have great lunch specials !! My bf and I eat for $25!!!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say......never been to a Cracker Barrel before and always wanted to try it. My family and I went this evening, I must say it did not WOW! Me. My expectation was not met and really feel I should have gone for the breakfast that everyone always raves about instead of dinner. The prices are fairly good for the amounts of food you receive and the service was okay. Nice little peg game at the table and a neat store at the entrance. My wife's fork was dirty, but the waitress quickly apologized and got us a new one immediately. My wife had the cheese and broccoli chicken and she loved the mash potatoes. I got the rib eye which was fairly good and tender. I was not to fond of the dumplings which I did not finish and the biscuits were hard. I love biscuits and gravy and Cracker Barrel did not deliver. I had better biscuits and gravy at the Waffle House. The overall appearance was great, loved the store, rocking chairs and chess tables. I would have gave this a three, but I usually base my decision on the food and it was mediocre. I need to try the breakfast next time and maybe I'll change my mind."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Cracker Barrel ever! Being that Las Vegas didn't have one until recently, I make it a point to go to a Cracker Barrel every time I travel and it is always amazing. 
The service, the food, everything at this location is nothing like ANY other location I have been to. 

The fact you can check in online and get an estimated wait, only to get to the restaurant 10 minutes before the wait is \"suppose\" to be over- to find out you'll be waiting an ADDITIONAL 45 minutes is ridiculous. 
And when you're called to the host stand? 
You'll have to wait again. 
And when you're walked into the dining room by someone who seems LESS then thrilled at their job and blandly states their name at the host stand (Ashley) 
You'll be asked to wait AGAIN by the fire place while they wipe your table. 

That happened both when we dined there on a Saturday afternoon and a Wednesday afternoon. 

After an estimated wait of 20-25 minutes, getting sat at an hour and 10 minutes... we received our food at an hour and 45 - not bad (35 minutes) considering the wait time.  Not bad if our food came out right! I had NO hash brown casserole- my medium steak was WELL WELL done, and my EGGS (this is the best part!!) REAKED of fish. And in case my nose was just throwing me off, I tried them~ sure enough- straight FISH taste. They had clearly cooked my eggs next to or in the same pan as fish. I about threw up. 

The manager came over, took and smelled my food, and brought me back another steak and eggs 15 minutes later (for medium steak....) guess how the steak was cooked? Well done. And I got to eat alone because my fiancé had obviously long finished his food (took a good 10 minutes for the manager to get to our table... so about 25 in all for the second go round of food!) 

Absolutely horrible. When my hash browns finally came out, they were burnt as heck on top and nothing like any other location. 

Seriously. The worst. And I am not generally a complainer. 

Save yourself the hassle (and 3 hours of your day!!) and go to a cracked egg."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and so was Dominique. The environment was overall great. It did feel strange when the other guy kept coming to check on us behind Dominique. It just seemed like she had it under control so I was just curious why he would walk up less than moments after she'd walk away consistently to ask if we were good. Pancakes were perfection (crispy edges), price was affordable."}
{"text":"No matter what I order here, I am always satisfied with my meal :) I came here for brunch on a Saturday. There were not too many people to my surprise, so we didn't have to wait at all. I keep hearing my friends rave about the country fried steak, so I ordered that along with some eggs and hash brown casserole. Best decision ever! I love the crispiness of the steak. I also ordered their bottomless strawberry iced tea. For some odd reason, each new cup of iced tea got sweeter and sweeter. I wonder if that's CB's way of making us stop getting so many refills :P After every hardy meal at CB, I love browsing around their store. They just have so many fun little things here! 

Cracker Barrel is one of those restaurants that never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I always feel bad to go out on a Holiday. My girlfriend really does not like to. Because,she says it makes the stores be open and people have to work on the Holiday.
But, Today,(New Years Day) we went to Cracker Barrel.
My girlfriend tipped very well because of the guilt.
They were packed! 
We got a table just at the other end of the Fireplace near the window. It was freezing. I think because, they had all the fans on and it was only 52 outside. This is why only 4 stars,it was sooooo cold.
Anyway, our food was excellent! Stephanie was our waitress, she was great!
We ordered Breakfast even though it was 1pm. 
They will give you either one,breakfast or lunch. Another great thing about them.
Even though they were so busy we still had great service and our food was awesome.
I really wish they did not have to work on a Holiday, But, it was great so Thank you employees of Cracker barrel.
Also we bought some stuff from the store they have some cool items in that little country store."}
{"text":"Giving the dinner menu a try...and sad to say that I think we're done with the Las Vegas Cracker Barrels...both have been disappointing several times compared to those I grew up with in the Midwest. 
Grace had chicken livers and I had the haddock dinner..the haddock was good even tho over cooked and dry...cornbread was greatly over baked and hard; we replaced them with some drier and harder biscuits (both were probably better at breakfast time, as well as the crusty grits). The table next to us got beautiful corn bread. 
Feels like losing a long time friend.."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, Cracker Barrel, no matter which location, is my favorite place to visit when I travel.  Not today. 

I ordered the Rueben to go.  I have ordered this from other Cracker Barrel locations and have always been thrilled with it. Not here. Contents of sandwich are spilling out of the sandwich, the cheese is over cooked and the grilled cheese was pulled off of the grill and served still attached to the sandwich. So okay, the cooks are busy or having a bad day.   Fine, but when I finally head to the cashier, she is so obsessed with high pressure up sales, that an already very long wait for food took way way longer. She just would not stop having ideas about things I surely must need. I needed none of them...I needed my lunch!!!!  By the time I got my lunch to the car, the sandwich was mushy and the fries were cold. 
  Very disappointed in this new location."}
{"text":"Worst Cracker Barrel experience, when we got here we were rushed to order,our food wasn't good and my husband found a huge piece of plastic in his food that he almost ate . And when we let the waiter know, she didn't act like it was a big concern and when she went back to show the cook she came back to let us know it was just a piece of there plastic labels and told my husband he can get a free pie. the manager was there and didn't even come to us to apologize. Not to mention our waiter wasn't nice either ....So I for sure wouldn't recommend this Cracker Barrel to anyone and we won't come back here,because obviously to them, eating plastic is ok.........Also we had our 3 kids,so it could've been them that almost ate the plastic, luckily it wasn't !!"}
{"text":"Starving after 4 hours on the road but not wanting fast food places attached to gas stations Donna and I settled on Cracker Barrel. 

It's like every other Crack Barrel where you enter and exit the restaurant through a enormous gift shop full of surprisingly well prices candies, candles, knick knacks, toys, etc, etc. 

Food is comfort foods such as chicken fried steak, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings, ham, fried chicken, catfish, and other stuff. They even have breakfast. 

For my meal I had the hickory smoked bone-in country ham with fried okra and turnip greens for my sides. The ham was very smokey and tasted great. The greens were actually some of the best I've had. Chunks of ham hock all throughout the tender greens. Okra was fried perfectly and steaming hot. For $7.39 this was some good eats. 

Donna had the chicken and dumplings with \"hashbrown casserole\" and fried okra. Her meal didn't look good to me but she said it was excellent. Her meal was also $7.39. 

Very efficient and friendly service. Since you pay in the gift shop we couldn't resist and impulse bought some stuff. Their mission was accomplished!"}
{"text":"Oh Cracker Barrel, where have you been in my life? I tried this place for the first time last week and enjoyed everything I ate. The place reminds me of a home in the country. Our waitress was a total doll and one of the cutest old ladies I've ever met. The plates are large and affordable and of course delicious. I had the spicy grilled catfish with green beans, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes and my friend had the country fried steak and eggs. It's home cooking at it's finest. They also have a cute little store up front with nick knacks and old school candy. I don't know what kept me from trying this place sooner, but I'll most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything you can think of and more is on the menu.... If it's not simply ask .... Yummy food affordable prices lots of homemade choices..."}
{"text":"As far as Cracker Barrels go, I have definitely been to worse. I am originally from WV and lived LITERALLY across the street from one at one point. 

My husband and I used their online wait list option to get on the list before we left our house - it was a 30 min wait, but we had to drive across down so it worked out well. We found a parking spot pretty easily but there were droves of people waiting outside. We checked in and still had about a 10 min wait. No biggie, I'll check out the shop - one of the big highlights of Cracker Barrel for me because I love their Christmas ornaments. 

This is where the stars starting falling folks, and I don't mean across the western skies. This is absolutely the most congested CB store I have ever experienced. It was impossible to look at anything without being stuck in a corner. It simply isn't big enough. I realize they just opened recently, but my issues weren't with the service, everyone was super polite. 

We were seated and ordered and received our food quickly. I took zero food pics because it honestly looked like slop on a plate. It was the chicken and dumplings so that is part of it, but it was all blended in to my Mac and cheese...how about putting it all on the side like every other CB I've ever been to? It was good and tasted as I expected, just very visually unappealing.

Checking out was very confusing, the carry out line is in the corner beside the cash registers, and I didn't realize it was actually one line for both. Again, super congested area. I'll be back because, duh, dumplings, but there is some room for improvement when it comes to layout efficiency.  3.5 stars would be most accurate."}
{"text":"Tried it for breakfast today.... after I left I drove next door to eat because I was still hungry.  My sampler breakfast sucked!! The grits under cooked, hash brown tasted old and stale, eggs mushy, and my husbands turkey sausage dry,  and our server was slow but nice"}
{"text":"YES IM A FAN. Thx CB for being there during my biz travels. U have saved my palette more than once. Food and service is good and very consistent as I travel from coast to coast. Way better than Denny's. Keep up the good work. Orale (from the Republic of California)!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places ever!  Great service, great prices greet atmosphere and last but not least, delicious food!  The Grandpa's country breakfast and Mama's pancakes are my favorites!"}
{"text":"Who fired Brad's wide? Employees are what makes a great restaurant, certainly NOT your bland food."}
{"text":"We came on the second day it was open at 6am. The server we had was new. We were literally his first table. He was very nice, and attentive. In fact everyone was very attentive. If there weren't so many people training and it being the second day it would have been too much. The food came slow, but it was the quality you expect. Everything was in line with the one we go to in Saint George, UT, including the gift store."}
{"text":"Two stars only mainly for take out.  Ordered half hour before arriving to location to pick up order, waited a good 40 mins before food was ready to go.  Got food, noticed everything was verified by the checker., so, didn't think of checking my order.  Got home 15 min drive, had three missing meals.  Called it in, they said to come in, sorry the checker forgot to give me the other bag.  I arrive, waited another 15 mins.  REALLY!!! oh I was beyond floored.  Manager came apologize, offered next meal for two would be on them.  it's ok.  BUT, this is the second time my order to go to 40 mins in waiting.  My advise, is if you really enjoy Cracker Barrel it would BEST to dine in. Don't think I'll be doing the 'To-Go' again."}
{"text":"I've been to many a Cracker Barrel, in many states and my family and I love Cracker Barrel! But this restaurant was by far the worst! The service was slow and I had to track down a waiter/waitress for drink refills. We had two servers and neither of them were around much even though the server in the next section was around all the time and taking care of her customers. 

The corn bread was horrible and dry with little taste. The butter was frozen and wouldn't spread so basically it was worthless. When our food finally arrived my chicken and dumplings was a lump of tasteless dumplings in a sea of gravy with NO chicken. I don't like to send food back or complain about it because I'm scared that the server or cook will do something to my food. My wife just gave me the cold chicken from her chicken salad to add to my Chicken-less chicken and dumplings. 

After receiving a check where they messed up the charges, I waited in line for 10 minutes to pay the check while the only cashier endlessly talked and chatted with the two customers ahead of me. When I finally got to the cash register I didn't yell, I wasn't rude or upset but when the cashier asked me how my experience was I told her the truth, it was horrible. When she asked if I wanted to speak to a manager I told her I didn't have time since my family had been waiting in the car, in the 111 degree Las Vegas heat, for the last 10 minutes while she chatted with the previous customers and I told her that I doubted waiting any extra time for a manager would help the situation. Now she just became the cashier that just wanted to get an unsatisfied customer away from her cash register. She didn't even fix the charges when I brought them up. The food and experience wasn't worth the overcharged $53 bill, which was reluctantly paid. This franchise won't get anymore of my money."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is one of my most favorite places. This one makes me sad. Biscuits were dry. Hash brown casserole was meh. Country fried chicken barely had enough gravy to cover the middle. The only good thing? We were seated within about 5 mins."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after a nice morning workout. She suggested we try this place as with both were first timers. I had the Uncle Herschel's favorite with overeasy eggs and smoked ham. The meal came with biscuits, gravy, and grits. The total was around 10 bucks. Everything tasted decent. I wish the ham was more tender however. Overall, I thought it was your basic comfort diner breakfast. I wouldn't say I would come back again bc the drive is quite far from where I live and it can get quite busy."}
{"text":"First of all if you're watching your weight, this is not the place for you. Otherwise, you'd feel guilty eating everything. The biscuits are warm and moist, and taste so delicious spread with apple butter.  The pecan pancakes are nutty and so tasty that you wouldn't need to spread syrup. The country fried steaks was a little dry, but saturate it with gravy made you forget the dryness of the beef. The country fried steaks was served with two eggs and hash brown casserole, which hashbrown baked in cheese..and was pretty good...its like potatoes and cheeses. Best part about this is that its served in large portion and the price is reasonable.  Now after eating go shooping for cutesy stuff like baby or toddlers outfit or country style rocking chair or candies. .or whatever you need in general store. Cracker Barrel is not only a restaurant it's literally a country store ."}
{"text":"I'm a Cracker Barrel fan. Doin' turkey and all the trimmings for lunch in Gilbert, AZ.

STOP THE PRESSES, HOLD THE MAYO. The Cracker Barrel in Gilbert is a winner. My server Timothy added"}
{"text":"We come here whenever we're in town... Love the rocking chairs out front... And the store at front as well, with all it's random items.. 

Came here on a weekday, late breakfast, and we were able to be seated right away. 

The place has a southern, casual, backyard patio type feel... Large dining area, clean... 

The few times we've gone here, I've only tried their breakfast items. Their menu is a bit large... 

So this time I opted for a healthier option and ordered fresh fruits, tomatoes, and scrambled egg beater.. No complaints, it is what it is.. But I was disappointed that their fruit bowl was soooo TINY!... I did try bites of their biscuits and pancakes, now those were tasty. Both light and fluffy. Yum! Try their hash brown casserole. It's cheese and yummy. 

Service was friendly and timely. 

In conclusion, the food itself is good, but the atmosphere is what makes this place worth trying."}
{"text":"The manager Corky was very active visiting tables and very impressively managing.
This is very unusual at most Cracker Barrel
Units.
My chicken tenders were perfect.
The server was just ok. She forgot the straw and never offered a refill on my drink.
Also forgot one of my side items.
I was also amused by the hostess- 
The entire restaurant had 10 tables occupied. She spent an inordinate amount of time staring at the I -pad  system of where I should be seated."}
{"text":"Noon time, sitting in rocking chairs on the front porch of the newest Cracker Barrel (North Las Vegas), we strained to hear our name called against the noise from eight lanes of Craig Road traffic twenty yards away. After a 30 minute wait, we were seated. As with all Cracker Barrel's, the food was very good but the air conditioning was so cold, many diners were wearing jackets. The gift shop was bustling with many shoppers.
This new property is lacking adequate parking being neighbored with an In and Out Burger and located near the Craig Road on ramp to I-15 South just east of The Cannery Hotel Casino...access is a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"Well, I've heard a lot about Cracker Barrel, but to be honest I wasn't that impressed. The prices are reasonable- plates start at about 9 dollars for a plate. I ordered lemon peppered trout and it was tasty, but I was unimpressed with the sides. The potatoes were rather bland, the Mac n cheese was watery, and the cornbread was dry as a bone. My other complaint (and perhaps I'm weird for this) but I'm one of those people who doesn't like their food items touching each other on the plate. I mean, if they touch each other, that's fine. But my fish was half covered with gravy and half covered with cheese sauce. My plate just looked sloppily thrown together when it was brought to me. The service was good though, no complaints there. I might come back to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"1st time here. It's really good. Definitely will be coming back to try out more stuff from the menu. The price is not to bad for how much food ur getting. It's like eating soul food. The soup & chicken was amazing. The Sunday chicken was really good but felt a little dry like it needed some gravy. They have rocking chairs to sit outside & play checkers. You should definitely try it out. They also have breakfast."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is, usually, a favorite of mine. I love the tacky store out front with all the silly gifts, decorations, candies, etc. I love the environment inside, with the fire place, checkers, and little triangle game on the tables. But #1 is the food. I love good ol' Southern food!

This Cracker Barrel's food was lackluster, at best. The food wasn't even particularly hot. Their sweet tea was a disgrace in the name of sweet tea. The grits were absolutely disgusting and an embarrassment to have been served.

I have to admit, I wasn't totally surprised - we're nowhere near the actual south. But nevertheless, I came in hoping for a tasty delicious southern meal, and left hugely disappointed.

On the upside, the service was fine. Nothing spectacular, but not a huge letdown either.

I won't be revisiting this Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I'm here right now just leaving and am overwhelmed with how nice the staff were here. I'm a newly single mother with a 6 month old who likes to grab everything off of the table and managed to get ahold of my milk glass and spilt it everywhere. The staff helped me out so much and it brought me to tears. Unknowingly to them, fiancé and father of my son passed away 6 weeks ago and I've been having a sad day today. I wanted to cheer up so I drove myself and son all the way out here to cheer myself up and start the day off right and I'm glad that I did. I was clearly struggling and the woman behind me happened to be a staff member as well and cleaned up the mess for me. They also comped my meal, which was as always amazing. I didn't get a chance to thank the manager on duty but will be writing them as well to let them know that they were so kind to me. This place deserves 10 stars. Thank you so much"}
{"text":"The food was semi warm... I think they had a new cook tonight? At 6pm they were out of baked potatoes and mashed potatoes!! Really. I was a bit dissatisfied tonight. But for the price I guess it was ok. I also felt the catfish needed to stay in the fryer longer. The food needs to be served hotter and brown the biscuits. Our waitress was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"Looks like they broke a plate and a part of it went to my mom's coleslaw. It cut her gums, it bled so much, it was throbbing and swollen the whole night. Manager filed a report and we didnt have to pay the bill, but we have yet to hear from corporate."}
{"text":"This place is one of my all time favorites. The staff is always friendly, the service is efficient, I never run out of coffee and the food is consistently delicious. A great place to bring family!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time, this past weekend with my Girlfriend.  She has been to this location before with family.  However, I had heard great things about the decor and food.  In short, I was very happy with my visit.

The food was simply good old fashioned, country, comfort food in every way.  Everything was excellent in preparation and delivery.

The customer service by the floor staff in the general store, our waitress, and the cashier were simply amazing.  They really went out of their way to make us feel at home, comfortable, and happy.  The general store, was simply a place you wanted to take your time shop.  They have some great little treasures from times gone by."}
{"text":"Can never go wrong with Cracker Barrel. I always take my CA family here and they've come to request it on every visit. For the most part the staff is friendly and the food is always delish! They have the best pancakes ever!"}
{"text":"Been twice. Both times extremely busy, but it was new. Service was fine. Food was great. Atmosphere was nice. Prices were acceptable."}
{"text":"The worse Management service today i waited
70 min for a party of 9 which we were skipped
We were told that it would be 35 min by the host. Then they squeezed us in like sardines
Management (Chis) argued with us and told us you can go back outside and wait (RACIST) jerk
As a manager you don't treat your customers like that ESPECIALLY U.S CITIZENS. .the food was ok and waitress staff was also okay. We had to be seperated so we didn't eat as a family
Like most customers there . MANAGER NEEDS TO BE FIRED AS RESULTS AS SHITTY CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Me and my co-workers go here for breakfast every week and we love it every time. The food is great and the staff is very friendly. Ashley is usually our server and she is great. She is funny and takes good care of us. It is also a LGBT friendly place which is very nice to see. You can't go wrong from having something to eat here."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for Thanksgiving.  The place was pretty busy.  And was fairly clean despite that.  Our server was cheerful and mostly on top of anything we needed despite the chaos.  The food was, well it's Cracker Barrel.  It seemed like it was processed turkey and was mostly flavorless.   Although it certainly beat cooking and cleaning up at home lol.   Although it was extremely busy the staff was very friendly and that is the 3 star rating on this one."}
{"text":"I been to this location plenty of times since it's right near my house. It can get very very busy so if you don't come early enough on a Saturday or Sunday morning then you are waiting an hour or more! 
The service can be pretty slow, but then again it is because they are always so busy. I've always had nothing but nice waitstaff every time I go. On a cold day get a seat close to the the fire,it is life! 
I must admit, I've only had breakfast platters here. They are just so good i never want to get anything else. I enjoy the big boy platter with their yummy country ham, fried apples, eggs and their, to die for, hash brown casserole. I hope to eventually try a lunch and dinner item soon!"}
{"text":"I just moved from out of state. So glad that this place is just a couple of miles from my new home. I went here for lunch by myself and ordered the aged rib-eye. I thought the food was really good and had excellent service, I was waited for 3 different people, how awesome is that ?  I honestly had a better meal and better service than freaking Gordon Ramsey steak."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT IF YOU ARE A PERSON OF COLOR.  The manager, I believe of indian or Syrian decent is one of the most prejudice individuals I have ever met in my entire life.  His attitude is discussing.  Please join me in boycotting this establishment.  I will never, ever eat here again.  Nasty, despicable place. I will forever let any person who will listen to me know that this place is a throwback to Jim Crow days."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has never disappointed.  Great food, Service was good, our waitress was polite and attentive. We ordered the Country Fried Steak and the Chicken n' Dumplins. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Standard Cracker Barrel design.
Nice and clean, friendly service and the new breakfast item was incredible."}
{"text":"California we are missing out. We stopped here for breakfast on our way to Camelback and I am so happy we did. I was a little worried because we were short in time but the wait went by pretty fast.

You walk along the front porch and it is lined with rocking chairs, giant checker board games and tables. So if you have to wait at least your comfortable. You walk in the store and it is wall to wall trinkets and treasures some things are stuff I have never come across before. Great little gifts for the person who has everything. I had a little trouble getting to the check in, I couldn't find it (I am short and it's all the way on the other side of the store). Everything in the restaurant is decorated so cute, reminds me of grandma's house.

Service was quick and they work together so there isn't a delay if your server can't get to you right away. Food-I don't even know where to start. They got a little of everything so you know you will definitely find something you like. I had the mama pancake breakfast. These pancakes are just like I had as a kid. Crispy around the edges and served with the cutest little side bottle of syrup. My bacon was crispy just like I ordered it and scrambled eggs were perfect not over or under done. My son had the pancakes and he thought they were also the best ever. I can't remember what my husband got but I know it came with everything-eggs, biscuits, gravy, grits, bacon, sausage, hashbrowns. I stole a taste and it was delicious. And good sized portions, basically come hungry and be prepared to take home leftovers. And for the price it was perfect. Side note, you pay at the cash registers in the store area.
 We will definitely be back on our next trip."}
{"text":"On our way home from Vegas we decided to stop cause we never had been but didn't get to eat cause I wasn't going to wait 50min especially with kids."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place.  Love the cheesy hash browns & apples.  Server was super pleasant."}
{"text":"I went here with my family birthday dinner really great food really great service overall great experience very well priced I would recommend going here to anybody"}
{"text":"First time at Cracker Barrel. Brought three others from work for an anniversary celebration. 

We entered thru the store and gave our name for the list. We were seated 10 minutes later. 

The potions and the menu selection were huge here, make no mistake. I had a hard time choosing. I settled on a chicken fried steak. Other choices selected were rib eye, chicken fried chicken and a big meat breakfast. They all came with a couple of sides, bread/rolls and veggies. 

The food was comfortable but not great. My CFS was not very crisp and the gravy was bland. My sides: fried okra and mashed potatoes, were very boring. 

Even my iced tea was left mostly ignored due to the calamity that is Cracker Barrel. 

I may be back but I doubt it. I always like to give a place a second chance but they really didn't do anything great."}
{"text":"Everything was great I especially loved the Loaded hashbrowns casserole. Everyone was very friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"This seem to be my go to when I'm looking for certain comfort food and not trying to be fancy. They alway delivers all of my go too. 

Steak and eggs with French toast
Fried catfish with corn, fried okra, corn and salad 
Fried pork chops special

These are my usual. I don't go often. Lawd knows if I eat this every week. I'll die by 2020. Their
food is consistent. Haven't have a bad customer service yet. But from time to time. I see how these poor waiters and hostess get mistreated. 

When there's a wait I get to relive my childhood. Looking at the Dots candies? Remembering I ate most of the papers instead of the candies itself. Or the toys I wish I can buy when I was younger. So this is NOT just a comfort food place but it's a place that bring me happiness with those little memories."}
{"text":"Yes!  I finally got to try a Cracker Barrel!  When I first entered the store, I already knew this was my kinda place.  Touristy and homey at the same time.  I love browsing through gift shops and boutiques when I'm out of town.  As for the restaurant part of it, I knew nothing could be worse than what I had the day before at the Original Pancake House (unless we went to Denny's), so I was looking forward to a REAL breakfast.  I was not disappointed!

I had the chicken fried steak, eggs, biscuits and gravy, and hashbrown casserole.  Everything was delicious and about $8-$9/plate.  Lots of good food for under $10!  

Service was extremely enjoyable, attentive, and friendly.  Loved the whole country atmosphere of the place.  We sat in their famous rocking chairs at a checkerboard table and played a game while we waited for our food.  

California needs a Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"It's just a sub par restaurant. Expected much more but the quality of food is just bleh"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend. I was excited to go since I haven't had their chicken and dumplings since I moved to Vegas from Illinois.
I suggest going to their website and doing the pre check in first. The wait can be long.
This place is packed, so I can see a few hiccups happening still. 
Our food itself came out late and the people next to us who were seated after us got their food first. Not sure if this was a kitchen error or if the server forgot to put our order in.
A manager came up right away and said the food was coming out soon.
A minutes later is when we got it.
Food was good, but the sampler entree platter was a bit.... sad, the ham was cut deli style with only one small slice and the over all presentation of that dish was lack luster.
I got the chicken and dumplings and it was great.
The server dropped the check before we finished and we kinda just stared at it since we had planned to order dessert.
Saw the server some time later and informed her that we wanted two slices of pie.
She came back with them and informed us the pie was on the house due to the mistake. Which was a good thing since the slices were cold with cold icecream on top. I suggest requesting it warmed up since it ruined the dessert all together.
Most like just order take out for the dumplings but not going back there for dine in."}
{"text":"All right! First time at Cracker Barrel and it was good! Country flavor and service! Rainbow Trout was delicious! As was the Mushroom Pot Roast! Fried catfish, turnip greens, mashed potatoes, chicken dumplings was the bomb! (great tasting). Peach cobbler on point! Biscuits and cornbread too! Can you tell I'm full?! Yep, will be back for many a dinner here!"}
{"text":"Best food ever here the wait is a bit long sometimes by totally worth it! The portions are great the prices are GREAT. The place is so cute and everybody is so welcoming, my family and I go almost every Sunday and we just LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Got told by a friend to add myself to the waitlist before we got there and glad I did! Only had to wait about ten minutes and it was crazy busy. Our server, Karen was so much fun. We got to learn a little bit about her and she made us feel like regulars even though it was our first time there. Thank you Karen! -\"Strawberry\""}
{"text":"Loved the pancakes & hot maple syrup. The little store had so many interesting stuff I kept buying more and more. Will be back soon and plan on eating here again"}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place. We don't have them in California so I make it a point to eat here every chance I get. 

Every location I've been to has always been pretty busy. This was no exception. 

I love going through the store and checking out all of the neat decor. 

The staff is really nice and helpful. I witnessed 2 employees assisting an elderly woman. They take care of their patrons. 

And the price can't be beat. You get a good amount of food."}
{"text":"Service was ok but the food my eggs were cooked like I like them medium to medium well just in between my bacon was good but my pancakes when they brought them out looked very light like they weren't done so I sent them back and when they returned with new pancakes they were just ok they don't bring u warm syrup anymore apparently because it wasn't warm and I remember about a couple of months ago the syrup wasn't warm unless u ask for them for warm syrup and that took seem like forever to bring warm syrup..."}
{"text":"We truly enjoyed our food this morning at the Cracker Barrel in Vegas the service was excellent our server Shandi was very attentive the restaurant is warm and cozy the staff was great. The best food we had in Vegas the entire time we were here. Hopefully we get one in California but please don't alter the receipes."}
{"text":"Katherine Torres. Supervisor and manager she says she is. I came off strong ; this I know. But the fact that \"corporate \" as she says, the website is NOT apart of Cracker Barrels ( near Silverton casino) problem is pretty weird.  

-I RSVP'D online which only gives me option for 6 ; needed 8 option. 
- Told us we won't be seated until 45mins. (What's the point of your online wait list.  )
- I cussed. She didn't like like that so I apologized and I toned it down. 
- fix the number of guest option so that you guys won't have this problem in the future.  

Katherine Torres did not do a great job to distress the situation.  She did not take responsibility and blamed corporate.  

I will be back because I love the food served here, but you can find a better employee."}
{"text":"Have come here a few times. I love the chicken fried chicken it is delicious.  The hash brown casserole is too. This time I had the chicken dumplings,  and it was not great at all. It was bland and hardly any chicken in the serving. My son enjoyed his salad, and mac and cheese. The waiter was friendly and did check on us. I will continue to come here, like I said the CFC is delicious.  Lots to choose from. If one item is not great just try another."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in this afternoon. It is a little confusing, the sign above the entrance to the restaurant said exit, then we noticed the menus on the stand. Once seated our server was right there and took our drink order. My husband decided to get the special of the day which was chicken pot pie. I ordered the chicken BLT. I looked at the pot pie as it was being served and the crust on top did not look like it was flakey or cooked. As my husband dug into it, he said he had 4 1/4 carrots 2 potatoes and a ton of peas. The gravy was just ok, no real flavor to it. He ordered biscuits for his side, which were dried out. As I stated, I ordered the Chicken BLT. The sourdough bread was barely toasted, the chicken looked burnt but actually tasted slightly rubbery, like it was microwaved. I had 2 pieces of cheddar cheese as advertised, however the cheese was not melted. I don't remember the menu stating the sandwich came with pickles although it had bread and butter pickles on it (I dislike bread and butter pickles). I had to cut the sandwich in half in order to try and eat it. Cutting it however, was a mistake. The bread not being toasted was getting near soggy and fell apart. I ended up eating a deconstructed sandwich. This is our second so-so experience at Cracker Barrel, I do not see us returning unless we have visitors who want to go."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, nice atmosphere.

One time we had a server who was messing up our order, but they were polite, and likely new.  This is a good restaurant to stop by at."}
{"text":"Hasbrown Casserole is killer! We've always had great service. Delicious food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time at a Cracker Barrel restaurant. Went to Cracker Barrel at 7 am on Sunday morning before heading back home to California. It was not busy and we were seated quickly. The service was great. The food was delicious and fresh!! Had the Mommas French Toast breakfast (4 slices of french toast, bacon and eggs) and I have no complaints at all. Will definitely be coming back next year when my family and I are back in town ... Or I'll just have to wait once the Cracker Barrel opens up in Victorville, California."}
{"text":"Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more could you ask for. Staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Dumplings, Chicken fried steak with gravy. What more can you ask for. The satff was friendly and fast, Cant wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Whether I order To-Go or dine in, this location has always upheld what I can expect from any Cracker Barrel. Great food, great service and good value. I keep going back."}
{"text":"Never a bad meal at cracker barrel. Our favorite breakfast stop. Price isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"First time at this Cracker Barrel. I arrived at 9:40 on a Friday morning. There was a huge party waiting outside but otherwise there were plenty of tables. 

Angela greeted me right away and got my order. I tried to order alacarte but she couldn't understand so I just ordered a Biscuit and gravy plus sausage for $5.99. The menu at CB was way too big to make an educated order so I just winged it. 

My breakfast arrived in eight mins. The biscuits were small but fluffy and the gravy was average. The sausage was really good and added a nice flavor to the meal. 

Cracker Barrel prides themselves on old, country atmosphere: slat wood walls, oak tables and brick floors. They've got that piece down, to a ridiculous point."}
{"text":"I was excited to go eat at Cracker Barrel but it crashed and burned quickly.   We had to wait an hour and a half to be seated.   Once we got seated we waited 20 minutes just to get water.   We are still waiting for food and it has been over an hour.  Manager and waitress need to seek employment somewhere else.  This is an utter joke.  Food is mediocre.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.

We are seating here watching other people get their food who came 40 minutes after we did.  Still no food 1 1/2 hours later."}
{"text":"First time ever being here. Really good food and awesome service. Everyone was so friendly! Prices weren't outrageous either. Ana was our server and she was so sweet and made sure we were well taken care of."}
{"text":"I have no Clue why people this this place was good. It was bearable at best.  The food was not awful, but not anything to jump up and brag about either.. The Store is interesting and I suggest you look through and browse."}
{"text":"It seems the quality of the food has really gone to bland and cheap.  I got a very tough country fried steak that had a blob of gravy on it. My daughter got the chicken and dumplings and it looked watered down. What ever happened to plate presentation.? The floor of the restaurant was dirty and don't get me started on how nasty the restrooms were. Our table was crammed in a tight area. My husband by no means is fat but he is very muscular. We barely fit on our side of the table. He was served his milk in little cartons. Honestly I doubt we will return. Our server was pleasant enough. She lacked skills in the details.  But I am
Assuming the lack
Of details of the floors bathrooms etc probably come from
Management down. I had to wait in a long line to pay my bill. Not enjoyable standing with a bunch of strangers trying to make small talk to you..  Cracker Barrel I used to enjoy my meals there but now I will look at what else is in the area."}
{"text":"Love Cracker Barrel, visiting the in-laws and they brought me here. Always good, got my usual Grandpa's Country Breakfast!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late breakfast and this place did not disappoint.  Those in my group had breakfast while some had good from their lunch menu.  Everyone has enjoyed their food and hands down, the best pancakes anyone has ever had.   The service was excellent and our waiter was awesome.  You will not regret checking this place out."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner on Friday Dec 16, 2016. Had the worst service ever, the crew that brought our food out spilled on my shirt, did not ask if we needed anything else like condiments for our French fries, waited almost 20 minutes before we were offered a refill on our drinks, spoke with manager and the only thing they offered was a free dessert and at this point none of us 5 at the table wanted anything else. Will never go to that location ever again."}
{"text":"Good ole' Cracker Barrel. They make the kind of food that you say is \"just like mama or grandmama used to make.\" Which you know isn't true because you realize they were never really that great to begin with. 

The country food here is good, which I'm sure you guessed. I love coming in during winter months and sitting by the fire. 

The biscuits, gravy, hash browns, catfish, apple butter, grits, pancakes, sour dough bread and sweet, country conversation leave nothing to be desired. 

In the summer you can rock in the chairs on the porch and pretend you're Andy Griffith until the elderly lady next to you slaps you in the face for repeatedly calling her \"Aunt Bea\". 

I won't do that again... :/"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is coming to Bakersfield! in the meantime, I like the one in Las Vegas. Forst, it is close to Bass Pro Shop so there's that.  Second it is close to the South Point Hotel and Casino, our fave place to stay.  Third, it is soooo country style! Food like my mom used to make when she felt like cooking! It is all country style and I love it.  I hate grits, but even those aren't half bad at the Cracker Barrel.  

I love breakfast best there, but lunch and dinner are smoking good too, I am told.  After eating, check out the gift shop.  There are bunches of really cool Americana and country style items there. They also sell things like their pancake batter, syrup and other items you may have sampled and liked during your meal.  

I just love Cracker Barrel since my first time there with my wife's Auntie Ambie in Virginia! I can't wait to make it a breakfast hangout when they open here in Bako.  I promise I'll get in early and give you Yelptastic folks my review on the local location when it opens!"}
{"text":"When in Vegas, the BF insists on coming here. I feel like when you're craving some good comfort food Cracker Barrel delivers. The food is good and cheap. The service is also good. It just amazes me how busy and how much of a wait people will do to get a meal here. It helps to have a gift shop to look at stuff to make the time pass but Southpoint is literally a hop, skip, and a jump away from CB and I know you'll get their food faster.

Luckily, they've opened another location in North Vegas so if you needed to get your CB fix you can travel there if the wait time is too obscene at this location. The Sunday fried chicken special is good and the chicken and dumplings are also good and filling. The hash brown casserole is a must try. 

I recommend getting here when they first open otherwise, look to wait a minimum of an hour on the weekends."}
{"text":"Tradition to bring my kids here after a Doctor appt or after a school event. we have breakfast no matter the time and then we go into the store side and play with all the toys until we find something we just must have. It's so much fun and the staff is always friendly. We get to get some candy and silly toys. Sometimes even mommy finds an item that wants to come home to my kitchen."}
{"text":"Well.. Amy the waitress From Houston Was the BEST part About this Experience!! We have been waiting  for cracker barrel to come to the west coast forever and Soo disappointing! The sausage was raw and the hashbrown casserole was cold!  Service was Superb!!  Seated quickly.. Everyone was friendly. Will give it another try however.. Everyone has an off day"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food and outstanding, friendly service. There isn't a long wait, even when it is busy, and the waiters make sure you are comfortable and alright. Real quick on their feet and comforting in spirit. 
I love their salads, as they are so fresh and a reasonable size. Delicious delicious! The only thing that gets me a little upset is how LOUD it is inside the building. Other than that, everything is near perfect!"}
{"text":"We noticed they had a low rating and the violations were food health safety issues. The broccoli was cold & trout a little cool. The sweet bake potato needed another 15 min of cooking. They seem to be happy with this score as it's becoming the average. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=128437&esttst_cty=60"}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.  

The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!"}
{"text":"Fürchterlich lieblos angerichtete Frühstücksspeisen und dann auch noch Zimmertemperatur bei den Warmspeisen. Service unaufmerksam. Manager bot Rechnungsstorno an, was wir ablehnten, dafür aber keinen Tip gaben. Nicht alles was sich gut ließt und nett aussieht (Interior) ist auch beim Essen gut.

Terrible served breakfast dishes and nearly cold. Service not very attentive. Manager offered cancellation of cheque but we declined, but we gave no tip. Not everything good looking is a good place to eat. Stay away!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I decided to try it out because it seems to be a very popular place. At arrival, it was very full and the wait time was about 45 minutes. I ordered the grandpa's country fried breakfast. It was pretty good. The hash brown casserole was my favorite along with the pancakes. My plate didn't come with pancakes but I got some off my parents and I highly recommend. The food was a 4/5 but the coffee was WATERED DOWN!!!!! I love coffee and making a pot of coffee is NOT hard. We got our coffee and we noticed it was very watered down so we ordered new coffee, our waiter said she'd be back with a fresh pot. SHE WAS NEVER BACK. It took like 25 minutes to get the attention of another server to get us coffee and she said, \"We've had a lot of complaints on the coffee, I apologize\". They brought out our food before they brought out our coffee. We were halfway done with our food when we asked ANOTHER server to bring us coffee because the other two didn't. She brought us coffee but spilled some on the table. She didn't apologize or clean it. DON'T GET COFFEE HERE. Our server never showed up again. We had to get the attention of another sever for the bill. POINT IS: FOOD WAS OKAY, SERVICE WAS AWFUL. I'm sure there are other similar places with better service in Las Vegas. My experience wasn't great."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is about as 2 stars as it gets. They don't do anything bad, but they really don't do anything good either. They're kind of like the middle brother of restaurants. It's just...there. 

So I've eaten at Cracker Barrel on two different occasions many, many years apart. I vaguely remembered the first time around that I thought they had really good syrup. Why syrup would stand out and not the meal? Not sure. Well, fast forward like 7-8 years, and I think they still have good syrup, and my entree was highly forgettable. For my entree I went with pancakes, eggs, and bacon. Kind of a staple breakfast for a place that caters to breakfast connisieurs. The pancakes were overcooked, and not just a little overcooked, like dark brown. The bacon was good, crispy just like I ordered it. The eggs, which I ordered over medium, were clearly cooked on way too hot of a griddle and closer to over easy. Pancakes had a decent flavor had they been cooked better.

My wife ordered the chicken fried steak dinner. Another blah-zay option. Gravy didn't have a ton of flavor. The meat did taste a little funny. Again, as a place that is comfort food city, you expect these meals to be decent, and they weren't.

The service also left something to be desired as well. We went on a Friday night, so we expected it to be busy. However, when the third waiter came over to help us, after placing our drink order two prior times it got a little frustrating. We also were dining with our 18 month old and always place his order with our drink order. We asked if we could get some of the biscuits they offer so that the little guy could get his eat on sooner than later. After 15 minutes, asking 4 separate people, we finally got the biscuits, followed by his meal about 30 seconds later. Our meals took another 15 minutes to come out. By the time we got our food a good 40 minutes had passed, we had an antsy toddler, and we were done. When the food comes out and it's less than desirable, it becomes Jason's Series of Unfortunate Events.

PS - the biscuits we eventually got were the most tasteless things I've ever tried in my entire life. Pillsbury canned biscuits are like 11x better.

Slow service, mediocre food at best, and wait times that make zero sense for what they offer. Likely going to pass in the future, which is too bad, because I want this place to be good."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way home to So. Cal.  The time was 2:00 well after the lunch rush.  Food was decent even though they need to do a better job of presentation.  Service was lousy.  Our waiter acted as though he did not want to be at work that day.  Water glasses were never refilled.  When I asked for honey he never brought it or came back out of the kitchen.  There were only two other tables he was serving.
When we went to pay the cashier was more interested in answering the phone rather than taking our money.  There were two others standing there who could have answered the phone.

Had the same experience at the Yuma restaurant.  Must be company policy not to focus on customer service.  Needless to say I won't be returning to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"This place is known for their rocking chairs, cute little country store and huge portions of ridiculously unhealthy foods. It's not gourmet dining so it's probably best to leave any high expectations at the door. 

I had only been to a CB once on the East Coast and was  excited to bring the hubby. We went on a Saturday morning on our way back to Cali so the wait was a good 20 mins. 

We both enjoyed our meals, we were definitely full and a bit bloated from all the salt but that's to be expected. My only regret was not getting a frozen apple cider...what's a little diabetes when your sodium level is already through the roof. 

I also attached photos for your viewing pleasure..."}
{"text":"Country Store  and Great Southern Style Food!  Service is also Excellent!

Pecan rolls are tasty and not expensive!  Item on sale can be temping"}
{"text":"Good value for what you get. Specials everyday. One of the few places I see chicken livers with mashed potatoes on the menue"}
{"text":"Yum and friendly. We just arrived in Charlotte and stopped here for breakfast. The staff was so friendly. They were fast and attentive. Very hard working. 

The food was excellent. My kids said the best pancakes they've ever had.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Very good and at a great price.  The bacon was thick but cooked to perfection.  Everything was tasty. 

Cute general store.   Very charming place and great for people with kids."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel as I am from out of state and I don't get to eat it very often but this particular location had HORRIBLE staff.  We sat there for at least 10 min without drinks.  We saw our server twice, never got refills and were basically left to chance.  I would not visit this location again."}
{"text":"Pros: Cute Kitschy decor, nice gift shop

Cons: Service

We had absolutely horrible service, which is mind blowing since all our server had to do was take orders and check on us, someone else brought out the food. It took 15 minutes to take our order. The coke was flat, so we gave them back. And that was it for our waitress. Not just for us, she was only in the dining room once maybe every 10 minutes, and everyone near us complained to each other too. When we did ask for napkins and jam, she brought the napkins. When we asked for the jam again it took forever. And it was like that with everything. At the end of our meal we asked for more water, since it was never brought without asking, and a to go box, so we got the to go box only. It was painful to ask for anything we were so frustrated. And really it's not like she was busy doing anything else. We regretted tipping her. Can you imagine!!! Feeling like you shouldn't tip your server, it goes against everything we know. 
My mom and Grandma enjoyed their Country fried chicken. I had some too and it was very good. But I had biscuits and gravy and didn't like the sausage, it had no sausage seasonings, it just tasted like plain pork. This was my first Cracker Barrel experience, and I will not be going back. Well, maybe to the gift shop."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Cracker Barrel for breakfast today. We arrived at 9:00 am om a Saturday and there was no wait! The place was busy and by the time we left there was a long line at check in. There was a roaring fire in the fireplace and that was welcome on a super cold morning. 

The place seems to be well staffed with what appeared to be more than one manager walking around to check on tables. However, they would walk by and mumble \"is everything ok?\" and they were gone. So, really there was no opportunity to say anything other than \"fine\". They should have slowed down to listen to their customers like they were actually interested if everything was satisfactory. 

Our waitress arrived quickly to take our orders. My husband and I both ordered breakfast combos. My husband asked to substitute an item and the waitress seemed confused if this was a possibility, so he said forget it. 

Our food came in about 15 minutes and it was pretty darn cold! I would have told the manager, but he walked by so fast I wasn't able. Cold food is the worst! The hash brown casserole was under-cooked and the potatoes were crunchy. The gravy tasted like a fireplace or liquid smoke. Which is weird. We asked to have it replaced because it was not eatable. The waitress happily brought another one and it was still very funny tasting. 

Despite all the managers on duty \"checking\" with customers, no manager came to check on our complaint or returned food. This is also weird. 

Finally, when I went to pay I asked the cashier if I could leave my cash tip for my server at the front (I needed change) because our table was all the way across the restaurant. She looked confused starting bumbling around a bit and I said never mind and walked it back myself. 

Overall, not a great experience, It is unlikely we will return."}
{"text":"Came to visit my pops and he suggested this place, well done, well done. . I recommend the campfire beef,  seasoning was exquisite on the meat and veggies.  My dad got the granola pancakes I was impressed. The decor is lovely,  antiques everywhere and cozy ambience. I also like their little store good knick knacks and candy. The only bad thing was we waited a while for our food, the waitress was nice it just seemed a forever wait to indulge our food. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Always awesome.  Been going to locations in Utah for years- I don't think we have had a bad experience yet.  Thank you Cracker Barrel for never disappointing!"}
{"text":"Never liked this place but others in my family love it. It's okay but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"4stars for consistency, good service and wholesome food. Not a gourmet restaurant just a great place with great food. Have eaten at many of these places and all have the same quality. Just a great place to fill your belly with a home cooked meal. Over the number if years I have stopped the portions have gotten a bit smaller. But then again all restaurants have either raised their prices or reduced the food quantity. 
When traveling, when I want a quick good meal, I stop at a Crackle Barrel if it is on my route."}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel in Indy, Dallas, Atlanta and Florida. This is by far, the worse one. 
No one was happy with their meals. The ham, chicken and fish was dry. The eggs were runny. The pancakes were flat and crispy. The only thing that was good were the biscuits. It was such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Just found out today they have poached eggs. The food is soo good for the money. Surprisingly, I asked the waiter if they served Voss water and he said no."}
{"text":"Went for fish fry last friday night. It was cod. It came with frys and coleslaw. It was very good and the portion was large. You also got a choice of biscuits or corn bread 1 of each or 2 of the same. The best biscuits I've ever had! The tarter sauce tasted homemade and was really good. 
Our waitress was super nice. She was so busy but was calm and gracious. We waited longer than usual for our food but noticed she had several tables and 2 large groups and she never ignored us. Kept our drinks full and food came out hot. If she felt rushed she didn't show it, thats a professional!  
Went there about 6 months ago for breakfast and it was very good. Came with grits and biscuits and gravy. First time for biscuits and gravy omg so good. 
Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"My brother dragged us to this place because he heard alot of great things from his friend. 

It did not disappoint - except for their cornbread which was so dry it tasted like foam. 

Try the blueberry pancakes - they are to die for. 

Also the sweet glazed chicken something - meat just falls off the bones. 

Their corn is good as well. 

Smores latte is okay. 

Service was a little slow. Given we were there during lunch on a weekday, they were pretty busy. 

Will be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is fun place to go to for north side of town.  Good place to take families and visitors , but I would not consider it as a regular go to place.  It was packed on a Saturday morning , service was slow for a party of 2.  The decor of the restaurant is very thought out, however the food was pretty basic .  Portion of pancakes were huge compared to my eggs and turkey bacon.  Hot coffee taste fresh.  Pancakes tasted like it was cooked In more oil , has a crispier taste which made me little queasy.  Overall it wouldn't be a top pick for me for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and won't be back! Coffee pretty much like water, biscuits were hard as a ROCK, eggs were gross, ham tasted like blood! Our food was down right horrible!!"}
{"text":"The hostess was quite rude, to us and multiple other guests she seated. 
Our waitress however, was very pleasant. The food was pretty bland cold and mushy."}
{"text":"To; The Buckeye, Az location off Watson..This had to be the worst dining experience ever! Don't get me wrong I love the shop connected to the Resturant and all the cute toys and clothes and stuff!! However, got seated wasn't busy at all. 3 adults 2 kid, my 16 yr old daughter almost sat in a chair full of water. On the ground was water everywhere. Server came over took our drink order and proceeds to tell us everything pretty much on the menu she never tasted except the mac and cheese, if that can gauge this girls age. She comes back and took food order and leaves and we never saw her again until the food came. I made the comment did you forget you had a table out on the floor. We have all been sitting waiting for drink refills for about 30 mins. She was yeah I'm sorry. Comes back with a pitcher of tea without any ice and fills our glasses with it. (No ice!) I made the comment, is that unsweetened ice tea, with No Ice? She said oh yeah I forgot the ice, do you want ice? I was like OMG we are seriously dealing with someone who hasn't been trained hasn't been taught and was clearly ignorant to the situation.
I did not get mad or upset just I won't ever go back to that location. Our food wasn't that good either. My daughter got the fried shrimp after removing the bread they were actually popcorn shrimp not full size shrimp. My order was dry and cold. My boys didn't eat the mac and cheese she suggested it was so salty. But as I said this location is a No Go for me!! Happy travel and Eats!"}
{"text":"So good! Wait is always a little longer than we would like but the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"We got here about 4pm and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. This was fine, as they have rockers and fans blowing out front. We actually went over to the Outdoor World for a bit. Basically they just call your name, so you must be back to hear your name however. The wait was a lot longer than 45 minutes. We ended up finally getting called around 5:15, which was 30 minutes longer than what they told us. We walked inside and had trouble trying to get to the host/hostess desk to be shown to our table. The store area when you first enter was way too crowded. Then we had to stand there for a couple minutes while they got the table ready. We finally got to our table and the place is extremely loud. The waitress was very nice and did a good job. They took our order quickly, however, again, we waited almost an hour for our food to arrive. The food was just ok, nothing to rave about. My wife's eggs weren't cooked enough and were runny, so we had to send them back. By the time we finished eating and were leaving, we had spent roughly 3 hours for dinner. Probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Not real eggs. This chain needs to die fast. Their food is not for humans"}
{"text":"Chicken and dumplings. Pure Southern Comfort! Try to get seated in Antoinette's area. Best service ever!!"}
{"text":"Suggestion:  be on the waitlist via online through their website.  There's always a long line but being on the wait list lessen the stress of waiting.
This is the first time we've been here, heard a lot of good things about this restaurant. We find this a little weird, there's a grocery type store before you go in the restaurant.  I guess this helps to keep your mind from the wait.  
We finally got called and got seated.  Amanda is our friendly server, we ordered big momma's breakfast and the sunrise sampler.  Everyone is happy and hungry. However, the pancake on the big mommy's breakfast is plain, they gave my youngest  the pecan breakfast.  Told Amanda, asked and made sure that we don't have to wait for that new pancakes. 
Overall I give this place a 4 star because of that mistake. Amanda, the one who serve us is AWESOME.  She made you feel at home
The wait is crazy though!!!! Be on the waitlist"}
{"text":"Good home style cooking with plenty of comfort foods. Breakfast, lunch or dinner, the have many choices to choose from. Lots of options for sides.  My moms favorite is the fried okra. We always go home with leftovers. My husband thinks the chocolate cola cake is crazy good. Service is always friendly and the place is hopping."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy this location but it has seriously gone downhill the service is sub par the food is cold and bland and the manager is a jerk. We came in on Wednesday night at 6pm there 
was no wait we were sat immediately and it was not busy we sat right by the entrance there was never a wait the restaurant was pretty empty. There were 6 of us 3 adults and 3 children they were out of crayons ok
so 3 Super bored children, the waitress took our drink order and which took a while to get then we placed our order and waited with 3 hungry bored kids when the food arrived it looked like crap on the plate there was nothing about it that was appealing and everything was cold especially the eggs they were like rubber. Any time we needed a refill or extra napkins we had to track down our waitress and when she brought the bill it was $71 dollars. I looked at the bill and could not figure out how 3  kids breakfast meals and 3 adult 1 breakfast, 1 dried up hockey puck Swiss steak and one fish dinner added up too 71 dollars. After I got home I studied it closer and decided to call and are if the manager could explain. He was SO RUDE he told me we ordered the wrong stuff it was not on the kids menu and I said ok well I must have misread the menu but the waitress could have told me or mentioned I ordered it differently so they were charging me for adult meals. He again said it was my fault and hung up on me. Yep I am calling corporate a dinner out with family turned into a ridiculously expensive mess!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast last weekend at Cracker Barrel.  I could eat their hashbrown casserole everyday!!!  It makes my mouth water to just think about it!!  The pancakes were delicious--nice crispy edges.  The eggs were perfect (hard to mess up scrambled eggs, but, it happens so often!) and the bacon was crispy just like I requested.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the \"country\" store that spilled into the restaurant.  The grits were bland...but, I have never been a grit-person.  And, the gravy for the biscuit was not the best, but, again, those could be overlooked because I was already pretty full with what I had ordered.  The biscuit, however, was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service!!!!! Everyone worked together which made my experience so much more comfortable!!! Although the food can be a lil simple, it's definitely comfort food"}
{"text":"Food was good. Manager and staff were nice but what I loved most was there gift shop. Only problem was the long wait on one of my food items they forgot it but were very apologetic about it so that was nice of them."}
{"text":"Most expensive breakfast in town. $160 when all was said and done! 

This isn't because of the food, it's because of that awful gift shop that just has so many things we absolutely loved and dresses for my wife, jars of goodies, candies, toys, knick-knacks, rocking chairs, games, oh for the joy of stuff stuff stuff!

We'll be back, Cracker Barrel, and will use your plentiful parking, easy access off the road, to have more yummy food and buy more goodies afterward! 

Men (or equivalent other half thereof), guard your wallets! :)"}
{"text":"Tried the grilled chicken tender dinner. Cooked perfectly. Grits were wonderful! Hard to find grits after 11am they have you covered. The baked potato could have cooked a little longer but that's my own opinion."}
{"text":"It was not my choice to come here, but some family was visiting and this was a place they recognized so they picked it. I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before and was slightly applauded that you had to walk through a gift shop in order to actually get to the \"restaurant\" part of the building. Why does a chain \"restaurant\" like this need a gift shop?? Have any of the people who go here actually been to an old-style country store? Highly unlikely. The people filling this place also were loud and obnoxious. I was not able to eat in peace or even listen to the people across the table from me in peace. 

The only reason that this place didn't get one star is because our waitress was really nice and attentive. The two eggs, bacon, and potatoes I ordered were decent and on par with Denny's or whatever. So that wasn't bad. 

There was a Panera Bread just across the parking lot from this place and I was just staring at it and wishing I was there..."}
{"text":"Mothers Day 2017, arrived at 8am before the big rush. Seated immediately ,waited 5 minutes before any waiter or waitress came, the manager stopped by and asked if we had been helped
when we said no he got a waiter who took our order ,the waiter came back with our coffee, but no place settings. wife went and asked for them. Then we sat there waiting while other people who had came in after us had their meal and we were still waiting for ours, ( this was embarrassing people looking at us as if something was wrong). finally got up and asked for the manager and explained the situation to him he apologized and at that time our meals arrived and the manager said he would pick up our bill for our inconvenience. by this time we were to upset to eat a meal after being embarrassed by all this.  went to IHOP great service there"}
{"text":"Place gets packed on the weekend.  Canes and walkers everywhere!  If you order food over the phone and pay at the counter and wait for your food by the hostsess. Also, if you have a weird last name like mine, the person bringing your food out going, \"oh fuck no this can't be a real last name\""}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel so many times I lost count. I love the store attached to the restaurant. From house decoration to clothing they have a bunch of unique cute options. I also love all the candy option they have, specially the ones that are not that easy to find anymore. 
I love everything on their menu, everything! But what wins my heart is their biscuit! I am not a huge fan os biscuits but the ones that they make I can't stop eating, they are just marvelous.
This time my husband and I decided to go for brunch. Even though we got there before the church crowd the place was pretty busy but nothing bad. Our table was ready 10 minutes after we arrived. 
We got both menus, breakfast and lunch so we could decide what to eat. 
My husband and I decided to get the same dish, two eggs, grits, bacon, ham,hash brown casserole, biscuits, gravy and fried apples. Yes, all of these was just one meal for less than $9!!!
The food came fast but was not the way we were expecting. Our eggs were not prepared the way we asked for. Our waiter in the beginning was really attentive but after he brought our food he disappeared, we asked for boxes 3 times and my husband had to go to the kitchen ask for it for the forth time. I will give this location another try since they are the closest one to my house but if we have a bad experience again we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch yesterday with my boyfriend. 

We thought it was hilarious that every handicapped parking spot in front of the place was full and that some of the other cars in the lot had the handicapped stickers hanging from them. No, we don't think its funny to be handicapped. We just thought it was hilarious that we'd never been out this early in the day together during the week for lunch. 

Aside from being the youngest people here for lunch, we were seated quickly and our waitress popped over to take our drink orders. She was very nice and though I don't drink lemonade, I thought about ordering it the two times she asked if I wanted one (haha). 

Our food came out relatively fast (a group of men across from us started up with a, \"Did we have a special order? They got here after us!\" then 30 seconds later their food for four was at their table).

Of all the Cracker Barrels I've been to, this was probably one of the nicer ones. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to find this Cracker Barrel here in Las Vegas, Nv.  It just by chance as I am not from Las Vegas and was here on business! Cracker Barrel was to open a few restaurants in California but have t yet! \"Too sad\"! But as normal for every time I have had the opportunity to eat at this restaurant I jump in with both feet! The only reason for no fifth star is the biscuits and corn bread was really dry for some reason?"}
{"text":"Nothing like Cracker Barrel. I haven't been here in a long time and I don't know why. I used to go to Cracker Barrel all the time when I lived in another state, but this is my first time to the one in Mesa.  You walk in through a fabulous old country store with old candies and clothing and all types of glassware's and pottery.  You can spend an hour just looking in the store.  Today I am having breakfast for lunch.  Okay they don't have eggs Benedict which is what I'm addicted to. Today I am going to try the pecan pancakes I'll let you know. OMG they are not skimpy with their pecans in the pancakes and the portion  size is huge.  The wait staff are courteous and very attentive. The facility is clean as in all the ones I've been to. Would I come back here again maybe  this Saturday."}
{"text":"The Cracker Barrel in chandler was nothing short of tasteless...grits were like runny snot,  tough... the country ham was paper thin could hardly be cut with a knife, not made to specifications....I asked for  over medium and received over easy and highly overpriced....bums eat better out of mc'd's dumpster"}
{"text":"Food was good. Got the biscuits and gravy but, maria the server was one of the worst waitresses ever.  Would have been 4 stars but service was not good at all."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and my waitress Patrice was warm, attentive  and genuine. She kept the coffee full and was quick to follow up with us after the food was dropped off. Definitely a welcome experience after a morning at the DMV!"}
{"text":"Have been to many Cracker Barrel restaurants over the years and this is a HUGE disappointment. Arrived on a Wednesday morning and had a fifteen minute wait. That is pretty good for a Cracker Barrel. 
Finally got seated and waitress took drink orders. It took a while for the drinks to get delivered and when they did the waitress said she would be back to take our food order. After a long wait another waitress finally took the order. Not sure if she was covering for the other waitress or vice versa but another long wait ensued for the food. When it finally did come to the table it was the worst Cracker Barrel food I have sever seen. Scrambled eggs were slivers of eggs and the eggs over well I ordered were over medium at best. They were flat and about as thick as a quarter. 
I think the oddest thing about the experience is I decided to fill out the online survey - which I normally don't do and it seems like all they wanted to know about is how was the gift shop experience. 
A gentleman assisting the servers, (Manager maybe?) seemed to avoid our entire row of tables. 
Definitely not like my visits to other locations but based on the other reviews for this location it should be a fair warning."}
{"text":"I was on a trip with my husband and the in laws as we made our way to St.Charles, MO for a wedding and we somehow managed to eat here. Twice. Yes, twice. So, the service is charming and friendly. The menu is chock full of traditional Midwestern fare (aka, everything has some surprise chuck of meat in it). I'll explain. 

On our first breakfast visit, I ordered the oatmeal and blueberry muffin combo and coffee. The muffin was nice and warm was meant to be shared. The oatmeal was really good, no quick oats here. And I ended up buying a \"ChiChi the Chihuahua \" dog for the car trip. Trust me. It was a good idea.

The second trip was more of a brunch and I ordered the \"Midwest Veggie Plate\", with my choice of 4 sides. I chose brown rice, turnip greens, potato wedges and beans. How 3 out of 4 of those dishes had shredded meat that was certainly picked out, will be a mystery to me. Brown rice with shredded meat? Beans with bits of ham? Turnip greens with a sliver of meat. It was like a demented macrobiotic plate. I kind of ate my meal, but with scrutiny. 

You don't really go to Cracker Barrel...you just kind of end up there. Best enjoyed on road trips with family."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at Cracker Barrel for the first time today. The experience my dad and I had was above and beyond. The food was phenomenal. Karen took care of us and we were blown away by her fast and excellent service. She loves what she does without a doubt. We will be coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"The Dean Martin location is always fantastic, wait is sometimes long but still not bad and the food always the same and always good. We love walking around the gift area at front before we eat."}
{"text":"Horrible. Food was bad, dry, tasteless, cold, stakes were cooked wrong & disgusting!!! There was one host name Juan, who felt the need to inform us of so many different things then when we asked for something he backed away & said he couldn't do it because he wasn't a server.... He was very agitating, & didn't know when to stop talking. 
& The MANAGEMENT SUCKS!!!!! They wouldn't do anything to make there mistakes right, didn't offer to discount the meals that were wrong & WE PAID FULL PRICE FOR ALL OF THERE MISTAKES!! NEVER WILL I RETURN HERE!!!! Your manager was so rude!! It's unbelievable!!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the breakfast at Cracker Barrel! 

The store is always so homey looking and smelling with a fire burning and the smells of delicious food cooking. 

The Grandpa's country fried steak breakfast is something that you need to try if you haven't. You will use up about all of your calories for the entire day but it is worth it. The portions seem to have gotten smaller but are still pretty good. 

The pancakes are great and the syrup is even better. One server warmed our syrup up before she brought it out and it made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"Boy, what can I say about this restaurant. I'll just leave it at disappointing. I've heard a lot of great things over the years about Cracker Barrel so decided to try it for the first time and I was really looking forward to it. 

I'll get the positive stuff out of the way first.  Staff are super friendly, attentive, and always smiling.  The restaurant itself is pretty neat and the storefront is fun to look through.

Now, for the food. Just...meh.  I had the country fried steak and eggs and it was just ok. I've had far superior versions of this plate in several other joints in town.  I felt the serving portions were relatively small compared to what you'd expect for southern cooking.  Same applied to my wife's order which was scrambled eggs and turkey sausage.  Eggs were over-cooked and the sausage dry.  Both dishes came with grits - this was the lowlight of everything - absolutely bland.  We both had to load it up with some salt and pepper and still didn't bother finishing it.  If you have to salt and pepper what you are eating, things ain't right.

If I have to pick some highlights, then I'd say the pancakes we shared were pretty good.  The biscuits were alright as well as the hash brown casserole.  Oh, and good coffee.

Safe to say we won't be returning since there is nothing to merit such. Besides, there are too many other really good breakfast joints in LV to go to.  And the location is kind of out in the middle of nowhere.  If you live near Nellis AFB, then I guess you're good to go."}
{"text":"I've grown up with Cracker Barrel, so as many Vegas locals, was excited to see a location finally being built near the Silverton. We did decided to wait a little bit before visiting allowing them to work out the \"kinks\" associated with opening a new restaurant. This seemed to be the right idea as many who have dined at the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas were unhappy the location didn't live up to the Brand's renowned country-style food and service.  After our visit, I can assure everyone they are working the issues out and are beginning to resemble to comfortable, easy eatery and general store I remember from childhood.

We actually attempted to stop by Cracker Barrel a week prior, but left after being quoted over a 2 hour wait! Granted, it was a Sunday morning, but 2 hours later would have been lunch time. This time around, our wait time was quoted at 40 minutes (which was almost exact). It was a chill day, so we waited. All of the signature rocking chairs on the porch were taken, but they had a nice shade and mister system and you could browse the general store. When our name was called we proceeded to the desk to be seated.

The restaurant was very busy. There was a lot of staff including corporate trainers to ensure everyone was adhering to the company's standards. Our server was on the slow side, but not horrible. I ordered my favorite biscuits and sawmill gravy with their delicious smoked sausage patties and fried apples (also asked for some amazing apple butter for one of my biscuits).   Everything was as expected, other than the coffee which wasn't the best. 

Until there are a couple more locations built in the valley, this one is going to be very busy most of the time. Although we will be back, it will most likely be on days where we have the time to wait the long list for a table."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: We love Cracker Barrel. We've eaten at them all over the USA. Been to this one multiple times, EVERYtime the food is hot, tasty & made just like we asked. The servers are nice, attentive & friendly. They have a new seasonal menu addition that has several great choices. At dinnertime, the noise level goes up from all the folks laughing as they enjoy time with their families. Bring your Loved Ones for good food & a good time. Plus the Country Store is fun shopping."}
{"text":"My first time here. Everyone kept saying I had to try it. So finally I was able to stop and tried it. We ordered breakfast. I had the country fried chicken with scrambled eggs. It was very good. Others had pancakes which very delicious. We asked for fruit in some plates and some of the fruit seemed spoiled. We ordered supreme coffee but I really don't know why they called it supreme, it was regular coffee (light) nothing special. I really don't like the small half and half capsules. We got our coffee with no spoon to mix it. I had to ask for a spoon.. I had to ask for napkins. I had to ask for more coffee. The overall service was lousy. Recommend it for the food but that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"The food is usually decent. The service is pretty bad though. We have had to ask to move tables to get different servers, on multiple occasions. We go because we enjoy their breakfast. Sadly, the last time we went, we had to wait an hour after ordering. We should have left."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED???  

Been coming here for about 5 years.  You used to come in and get waited on in 5 minutes and get your food in about 10 minutes more regardless of how busy they were!

Now you come in and get waited on within 30 minutes and get your food within 30 minutes more if your lucky!

Today I was given coffee and water in about 5 minutes and was told by the waitress she would be right back to take my order.  A half hour later she showed up to take my order.  45 minutes later my food arrived!  Yeah, I did get my coffee refilled, but no more cream... and had to ask for bill 5 minutes after finishing breakfast!

Recently came in with friend and after not be acknowledged for 15 minutes... went to another restaurant!

While waiting for my breakfast, an apparent manager was asking 2 guys if he could give them free desserts for the bad service they were receiving.  He should have been giving free dessert to everyone  in the restaurant from what I saw.

He also passed my table and asked \"How is everything BOSS?\"  If I were his BOSS he would not be giving away free dessert... He would be out!  

The food is great but who wants to spend there day waiting."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to cracker barrel the other day for dinner. It was our first ever visit a cracker barrel, we honestly loved everything about it! Everyone was so friendly and helpful. They were super genuine about it too. (because you can totally tell when someone doesn't enjoy their job and is just there to receive a paycheck everyday.) Everyone tried to answer our questions about the shop and were telling us the types of deals they had, like the 3 bags of gummy candy for $5. Even the cute nostalgic games and sodas that had, it felt like a blast from the past almost, especially with the different artwork on the walls and the color posters and knick-knacks scattered around. I also like how before you enter the shop there are all of these rocking chairs you can sit on. I enjoyed the atmosphere a lot.

As for the food, in my opinion was delicious. Everything came out hot and fresh, well seasoned. There was actually a lot of food. Ha, my boyfriend had the french toast with sausage patties. He liked that they were actual sausage patties. He also enjoyed the mini bottle of syrup it came with. I had the country fried steak with mash potatoes, mac and cheese, and corn! With the dinner course you also get a choice of a biscuit or cornbread.. I couldnt' decide, so our waiter gave me one of each. We actually shared our meals together and we were pretty full afterwards. For drinks we had a sweet tea and raspberry lemonade, they were so yummy! They were not that sweet at all and they were super refreshing to drink. The food came out pretty fast and the place was pretty packed when we went in.

I will definitely go there again. Everyone was so pleasant and the food was yummy! I would recommend coming here if you want to just relax, enjoy some dinner, and do a little shopping too!"}
{"text":"It was the mother-in-law's birthday brunch.. and she wanted to go to the new Cracker Barrel that opened near the Cannery on Craig in North Las Vegas. Although this is on the completely opposite side of town from which we live, obviously we had to oblige her for her birthday. This location has a long way to go until it reaches the standard the popular chain has set for service and food.

One positive thing I learned from this visit is this location allows you to check in online to avoid the multi-hour wait at the store. When the location near the Silverton opened recently, there were long waits for at least 2 weeks after opening. This allows you to avoid being in the crowd for extended periods of time. This system worked great and we were seated within 15 minutes of checking in with the host after arriving at the restaurant.

The service and food at this location is what warrants the 1 star rating. Although they have been open about a week, this staff is uber amped up with loads of servers, corporate trainers, and managers. Our server was completely clueless, forgetting our orders for our drinks 3 different times and only finally brought out the correct drink for the 2 year old at our party when the food arrived.  A trainer took our food order and I held my breath that she would make sure our order was correct and come out timely. Our order took well over 40 minutes, came out in pieces, and missing important accompaniments (e.g. Syrup for French toast and pancakes, apple butter for biscuits, etc). Our incompetent waitress failed to come back and check on us, leaving us with empty coffee cups,
Cold food to send back, and NO SYRUP!!  There were so many people running around this place and no one came to check on us or to make our order right. Finally, when leaving, I refused to pay for the French toast we did not eat because of no syrup being delivered and spoke to a manager.

As I waited for the trainer I flagged down to get a manager, I realized the biggest issue this location has to fix. The management need to touch the tables, engage them with light conversation to make sure everything is ok. Along with some staff members that definitely need to be let go, the management needs to do more than stand around and actually talk to the customers to see what they can improve."}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be 30 minutes. We waited an hour and a half. It was extremely packed so I'm sure that's why the service was subpar. We ordered the catfish special. The catfish was really dry. We also ordered breakfast...French toast was really good, cheese grits were okay, the hash brown casserole was really good. You have to try the raspberry lemonade--by far the best I've ever had. The hush puppies were amazing as well. If I ever go back I would just get hush puppies and lemonade."}
{"text":"Our dining experience here was disappointing. We finally decided on eating here due to lack of non fast food restaurants in the area. Order came out semi warm not hot. My chicken fried steak was soggy, not cooked right and I'm thinking it might've been microwaved. Had it sent back and ordered something different. After complaining about it the staff ignored us and we had to constantly get someone to wait on us. Instead of the waiter checking on us for refills or condiments. Will not return, staff could use more training and line cooks need to work on their skills in the kitchen. I think we were treated better by the hostess in the entire restaurant. Wish we would've picked a different place to spend our money."}
{"text":"Great place! I'd never eaten at a Cracker Barrel before (we don't seem to have them out on the West Coast) but had always heard good things and I wasn't disappointed!  Two of us arrived just past the dinner rush, the place was still quite packed however we were seated within ten minutes or so.

Our Server was quite friendly and upon hearing that my friend and I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before she patiently explained all of the menu items and specials along with the Cracker Barrel specialties.  Our food arrived quickly and was just what we ordered.  Portions were generous and we both left with full bellies.  Now if only they would expand to the West Coast!"}
{"text":"Just had an amazing breakfast. Service was great. Not bad for being opened one day. Only negative is the small parking lot."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars for this restaurant, I would. The wait was over an hour just to be seated, but we waited nearly another hour after we finally ordered our food. And when the food came, it was tasteless and barely warm. I later emailed a complaint to the company's website and was promised that the Las Vegas manager would respond to me, but no one ever did.  Not a surprise considering the terrible service and food at this location. That was my first time dining at Cracker Barrel and it was my last. Save your time and money and avoid this place."}
{"text":"I am one of the commoners on Yelp who actually does enjoy some chain restaurants.  I do support local businesses, however sometimes I just need a biscuit, some country fried steak and a Yankee Candle - so the Crack works for me.

This Cracker Barrel, located just off of 77, across from Carowinds, has been a go-to for several years, as my love handles can attest to.  The wait staff is generally friendly and attentive, I usually get there around 11:45 for lunch, so there is rarely a wait to be seated, although towards the end of my lunch, folks are usually starting to line up.  It's usually busy during lunch time, but not in a crazy way.  But if you do have to wait, I love the rocking chairs out front on the \"porch\".  Parking is plentiful and they also have spaces for RV's.

My typical order is the country fried steak with the gravy on the side, corn, green beans and hashbrown casserole, and biscuits (the corn muffins are fine, but I always end up choking unless I drown them in butter).   CB has also added sweet potatoes and other \"healthier\" side items to their menu so it isn't ALL just grease and butter.  (mmmmm butter).  Salads, pot roast, chicken and dumplings, greens, baked chicken, fish... you can find just about anything you want here and many things you don't need.

The general store out front always has some interesting things for home or to wear, they usually have a good rack of sale items as well - yesterday I picked up a pair of UNC lounge pants for my dad that were 25% off - yay!  With every kind of candy you can imagine, if you are wanting to get the diabeetus, this is the place for you.  The bathroom is usually cleanish and checking out is easy enough."}
{"text":"Great food and cute store. Service is good but it seems like we always have to wait awhile to be waited on. I know my parents have left due to never being greeted, but I just wait it out. Once a server has come over we have never had a problem!"}
{"text":"awfull!!! portions are small, its not too expensive which made me feel happy at the end of the meal cause i would be really mad if i had to spend more than $25 for that awfull meal!!!
this place is for old people! nothing exciting. i had fish sandwich on a very soggy bread, sides were very small, mac and cheese i had better from the box.
the food is very southern style, not much of a healthy stuff on menu and for sure no choice for vegatarians or health concious, maybe thats the reason why everyone thats overweight is there.
no! we will not be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was a very subpar experience I have ever had at any Cracker Barrel!  my husband and I called ahead for our to-go order. We were told that it would be 10 minutes to make our orders. We arrived in 11 minutes and took our time to grab some candy and proceed to pay. 

We heard the woman ringing us up request for our to go order. We waited for an hour and asked numerous people about our order. I finally asked for a manager and he didn't want to stop and actually listen to my concerns. All he wanted to do was shut me up. He went back and returned with someone with our order and continuing to talk over me not fully understanding my concerns  

Mind you this was my birthday and we called our order so we could pick it up and go!! It took so long that we could have sat down and ate being that it wasn't even that busy 

All the manager did was give me a \"Birthday dessert\" which is already free  An experience no one wants on their birthday  I will not be returning to this location because there is another location that takes the same amount of time to get to"}
{"text":"This CB use to be our ultimate b'fast stop on the way to Lake Pleasant or driving out of town. We were there so often that one yr they sent us a Christmas card - so I know what I'm talking about. The quality of food has slid to the very depths of the barrel. Once delicious, warm bisquits are now hard as rocks. Ask for crisp bacon and you get wiggly hunks of pork. Their eggs are rarely cooked as requested by the customer. Hot cakes couldn't be cut with a knife and fork (last time there). However, my biggest complaint....soft drinks have NO carbonation...EVER! If you mention this to your server, they say I'm sorry, and bring you another one....the SAME WAY!! WE'VE MENTIONED THIS SOFT DRINK PROBLEM FOR AT LEAST 10 years, and it's still the same. So, although I'll miss my waitress Norma (excellent by the way), I won't be a Cracker Barrel customer any more."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel USE to be our favorite place to eat - especially for breakfast, not so now.  Why, you ask?  Let me tell you.  The food is WAY less than stellar!  The biscuits, which use to be light, golden brown, and fluffy, are now HARD, over-done, and inedible (not to mention they're extremely stingy with the jam).  The scrambled eggs (which I have) are hard, over-cooked, and cold.  We ask for crispy bacon and it comes out limp (and once again, cold).  My biggest gripe is the Diet Coke!  The Diet Coke at Cracker Barrel is ALWAYS FLAT!  Not sometimes, A L W A Y S!!!!!  I think the warm liquid is poured over the ice, which makes it flat - just a guess.  In short, my favorite place has turned into the worst.  We won't take friends there any more, and we certainly won't be going back."}
{"text":"We went there for a late breakfast. I had the Smokehouse breakfast. The sausage links were good, the scrambled eggs not so, VERY bland, I told my wife \"even the scrambled eggs I 
make at home are better than this\". The biscuits and gravy were good. Our granddaughter
only had yogurt parfait, we tasted the fruit, it had a more sour taste than usual. My wife had the old timers breakfast...the \"over easy\" eggs were runny. The service was slow, and the restaurant was only 50% full. We were disappointed."}
{"text":"I finally made it to this location after months of being open. We came on a Tuesday evening so it was not as busy and we waited 10min at most. The location has the same setup as all the other locations around the south with the rocking chairs, retail shop and the table seating and menu. I ordered country fried chicken with baked beans and a hash brown casserole. Everything was up to par with the other Cracker Barrel's I have been to and I will gladly come back again as long as the waits aren't ridiculous."}
{"text":"Last year people were talking about cracker and barrel. People was so excited about it. So today after tennis, told my friend to give it a try. When we got there, first thing we saw was a dry good store( similar to cinnamon girl in Hawaii)and we were ushered where to go.and we reserved our table and told us to wait for 20 minutes. Lo and behold got called after. 
Whoa, the place were packed,and so I thought they must have a good breakfast. 
While we were waiting for the waitress/waiter, my eyes were rolling and seeing those decors on the wall. Whoa, soooo much decors. The ambience is nice and clean. Staffs were nice and presentable. Very attentive but they don't really good in looking what you've ordered. Plus, food was bland although condiments are available at the side. I ordered a over well eggs however they served me an over easy which my friend ordered that. So we had to switched our eggs of course. Coffee wasn't taste good, can't really taste the coffee:( .
Overall, an experienced to eat there ."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I LOVE this restaurant so much. We visit here on a weekly basis and I am constantly raving to my friends and family about them. My husband and I were out with a few co-workers yesterday (April 16th 2017) and decided to treat them to lunch. I checked in online for 6 people and saw there was an hour wait, which seemed reasonable considering it was Easter Sunday. On our way to the store we had one additional person agree to go, so when I got there the girl added the other person to the waitlist for us. She told us there would be a 50 minute to 1 hour wait which is what we were expecting. We went to the gift shop, bought some drinks and snacks then headed outside and sat on the porch to wait. After an hour I went back inside to check on our status and the girl told us it would be an additional hour + wait. Mind you, I am here with friends and have bragged about this place to no end. When I asked her why we had to wait another hour she said it was because the size of our party and they could not accommodate us. Meanwhile, there are plenty of smaller parties of 4 - 6 being called over and over. The staff basically told us too bad, just wait. After hearing of the additional wait time a couple of people from our party said they couldn't wait the extra time so we all went our separate ways. This was extremely disappointing. I'm pretty sure after this my friends won't be back and I'm not sure I'll be going back either. 

I am giving 3 stars because normally I love this place. The food is awesome in my opinion and the staff is usually great. Maybe they just don't do well under pressure."}
{"text":"To be quite honest, I was more impressed with the vintage decor throughout the restaurant than I was with my actual meal. Since the opening of this location last year, my parents have been wanting to bring the family here because it was one of their favorite restaurants when they lived on the East Coast years ago.

Cracker Barrel definitely gives me that mom-and-pop feel. You walk up to the restaurant to find a long porch lined with wooden rocking chairs from beginning to end and as soon as you go through the double doors, you'll find yourself in well, the \"Old Country Store\". There are a lot of novelty items for sale such as sodas in glass bottles and old fashioned candies and snacks that are sure to get the nostalgia flowing. Our wait time for the table was about 15 minutes or less and it went by fast since we were all browsing the gift shop.

The dining area of Cracker Barrel was a lot smaller than I had imagined and the table we were at was a bit close to the party next to us, so it was difficult to get in and out of your chair without bumping into someone. Our server Jeff was very friendly. He took the time to explain the menu to us as well as what specials were being offered. We all ordered a meal from the Fancy Fixin's menu. It came with your choice of any three Country Vegetables N' Sides and two made-from-scratch Buttermilk Biscuits or Corn Muffins.

I went with the Chicken Fried Chicken and chose mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes with brown gravy, and whole kernel corn. I also opted for one buttermilk biscuit and one corn muffin since I couldn't choose between the two. Our meals came out in a decent amount of time. I looked at my plate and was reminded of those TV dinners that my mom would tell us to nuke in the microwave when she didn't feel like cooking. The chicken fried chicken was nice and crispy. I like that the sausage gravy didn't make it soggy. The portion was huge! I could not finish it. My sides were okay, nothing special. I'm def a fan of the buttermilk biscuits though. Corn muffins were a little salty and didn't really taste like corn bread.

Everyone enjoyed their meal. Service was good and prices were great! We will be back again soon, but for breakfast! If you're looking for a decent, filling, homestyle meal, Cracker Barrel's got you covered."}
{"text":"The only place I enjoy coming for breakfast. I've never dined at this location but I must say the service was slow and that's why I only give it three stars. I'm going to assume that because I came right at noon may be the reason for delay? But knowing how things get busy in the area for lunch time you would think the property would be better prepared. I was part of a party of 3. It took us a bit over 30 m to get our breakfast. 2 French toast platters, a side of fries and a small thing of grits. The grits btw are ridiculously overpriced, the is not even a small bowl, more like the size of something you would feed a less than one year old baby. Not sure why they charge $3 for that. The food was still good, don't get me wrong, but for simple breakfast items the wait was too long. I think next time I'll go to the one off Billy Graham in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for years to try Cracker Barrel...finally I took my family and was so excited for the whole experience. I was sadly disappointed....very disappointed. The service was slow, so slow and the food took a long time to come out. The eggs were cold and dry, the bacon was OK, the pancakes and biscuits were good when we finally got them. When we asked for ketchup they brought us ketchup packets because they were out of bottles. I would understand if they were super busy but when we got there they weren't busy at all. I'm so bummed. I gave them one star because the biscuits were good."}
{"text":"Ok.. since the last time I was at this Cracker Barrel (on June 7th, 2012 ... with it's respective awful experience with of not getting a Rib Eye steak cooked to my liking) ... I tried several times over the course of two months following my last visit to register a complaint at the crackerbarrel.com feedback page .. that .. when submitting the feedback.. threw a 'web server 501' error (likely meaning a programming or setup error malfunction on the server prevented the operation from finishing).  Finally, in August 2012, the 501 error was fixed and they received my feedback .. albeit 2+ months late.  They promptly responded in snail mail a FREE 1 PERSON MEAL coupon to be used sometime before 1-13-2013.

Well ... today ... Nov 24, 2012 was the day I returned to Cracker Barrel to give them another chance at making a Rib Eye dinner for me.  My girlfriend ordered a Meatloaf meal.

Our meals were .. .much much better (at least mine was) than last time.  The Rib Eye was cooked to medium (as I like).  I could use a steak knife and cut it rather easily.  It had good flavor.  I also had cornbread muffins and a baked potato with butter.  Cornbread muffins *always* tend to be a little dry and tend to clump in the back of my throat. Usually I need a drink handy to wash it down as it clumps.

My girlfriend really like the meatloaf meal she ordered.  Thought it was a good change from what she considered to be normal.  It was quite tasty and the vegetables she selected were also very good.

The only chink in the armor of my meal was the baked potato.  It was very very well cooked (or nuked.. not sure if they use a confection oven or a microwave oven) with the ends of the meat of the potato being very hard (like an over nuked or over baked potato gets) and the skin (which I do eat) was extremely tough.  When I asked the server for a new potato, I said \"the potato's skin cuts like leather\". When coming to that conclusion, it took quite a bit of downward force on the knife to cut through the potato.  A baked potato shouldn't offer so much resistance to being cut.

After the server replaced the potato, the replacement was absolutely fine. No problems.

The only other chink was service.  Service wasn't spectacular. Generally, I give servers a standing rule that if they see my drink nearing or beyond half full, bring another without asking me.  Eventually, I'll slow down and on my last drink it'll take a long time for me to get down to the halfway mark.  This particular server had a hard time keeping me well lubricated with my Coca Cola. There were many times I waited for the next Coke to arrive for a few minutes.

In general, this visit to Cracker Barrel was somewhere near average.  Not great. Not awful.  Had my first baked potato been edible an the server kept me sufficiently lubricated with a constant flow of Coke .. they'd have received 4 stars.  Because it didn't .. this was a great improvement over the last time .. but didn't WOW me.

3 stars."}
{"text":"We were surprised at how good the food was and how generous the portions were. 
I had a country fried steak. I can't belive it's served it 3 side choices. It was really good, however I'm not a huge fan of country gravy so I ate it with their brown gravy instead. 
I started off with their vegetable beef soup and it was also really good."}
{"text":"My husband & I ordered chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken with sawmill gravy.  Waitress brings the meals out without gravy and said it would be a wait until the gravy came.  9 min later she brought the gravy for our dinner.  My meal wasn't hot to begin with.  9 min after she put it on the table it was cold.   On the way out, the manager was standing right there so I told him what happened.  He apologized and took $1.99 off the bill.  Are you kidding?  He was $1.99 sorry they thoroughly messed up our meal."}
{"text":"Husband & I are huge fans of Cracker Barrel & love hitting up different locations on our road trips! However, our local cracker barrel has really dropped the ball this morning. My hamburger patty was so over cooked I needed a knife to cut it. I couldn't actually imagine the same meat in an actual hamburger, it'd break someone's teeth! My husband's fried apples had a total of 4 measly apples included, I had to actually take a picture of those! 2 tabs of butter couldn't rescue the dried out grits either. 

After we were finished with our meal we waited quite a while before the waitress finally checked up on us so we could ask for a to go box. In the meantime, I might have been able to ask the manager for a to go box instead but he COMPLETELY skipped over our table during his \"rounds\". Like literally asked the table in front of us if everything was ok then walked past my husband & I & proceeded to ask the table behind us if everything was ok. Looked like he asked the whole restaurant before returning to us AFTER the waitress had finally been around. 

Overall the Vegas local just doesn't seem to really care like the other locations we've stopped at had. The food is sub par & the service is always lacking. Really disappointed I waited years for a local location to be so let down."}
{"text":"\"The things we do for love...\" 

Ordinarily on my Boycott list due to discriminatory Corporate policies, our visit was prompted by a search for specific Beanie Boos my niece wanted for her seventh Birthday which we could not find elsewhere. My SIL frequents this location and advised that the desired stuffed animals were indeed in stock here. 

Begrudgingly, we headed over to the 'Country Store' side of this chain, Sysco-to-table sourced restaurant. They did have the most extensive selection of Beanie Boos we have seen, and were offering a \"buy two, get one 50% off\" special. 

Because of the special, we purchased more than two, receiving excellent customer service from a girl who noticed us searching, she checked the computer and brought the wayward \"Tuffy\" to us from the stockroom. We were rockstars in the eyes of our niece at her party, but the tea set we purchased at a locally owned \"paint your own pottery\" shop made us feel better as educated and socially conscious consumers. 

Even the cashier was very friendly, thanking us for our visit and inquiring if we found everything ok. But, none of this pleasantry is enough to make me patronize this chain which discriminates against basic human rights whilst billing itself as \"All American\" = duplicitous at best. Two stars are for the helpful associate and friendly cashier.

* extensive inventory of Beanie Boos in all sizes *"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food wasn't bad but nothing I'd write home about.  I can honestly say I've had better, in a lot of places, as the pancakes were average and the sausages were just standard run of the mill.  Sausage and biscuits were a bit too runny for my taste, hash browns were a little burnt and the pancakes were ok. I did, however, enjoy their blueberry syrup.  All in all, I would come here in a pinch but not something I'd go out of my way to try."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for just a quick dinner tonight. We were greeted by multiple people when we walked in and were seated right away. Our waiter was Kevin and he was awesome. Incredibly friendly, very attentive and knew the menu. I'll be honest, I've been to other cracker barrels and although I've never had a bad experience it wasn't anything great. Tonight, changed that and I can say that I would definitely consider going back to this cracker barrel based off the service that Kevin provided and the overall friendliness of the whole staff."}
{"text":"I LOVE there small little shop! So many unique knickknacks! Food is okay,very greasy I would say..nothing special...great service! Very friendly so that's a plus! I'm giving it a 4 star for the shop and service,not so much for the food..."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on my way back to Los Angeles, had Sara as my server she was very nice and checked on me often. The meal was very good I had Grandma's pancake breakfast it was cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I have been enjoying Cracker Barrel for many years.  I brought my dear friends who had never been to one before.  Sadly, I wish I had not.  

The initial order was pleasant.  As the food arrived it was clear that was not up to the standards I have come to know.  My order was not correct.  The yolk and white of my over medium eggs flowed like a beverage.   We all thought that there was something wrong with the sausage as it refused to be cut and chewed.  The replacement gave us the same challenge.  It was dry and tough but at least warmer.  One diner had to wait more than 7 minutes for 2 little bottles of syrup.  The biscuits were tinier than most Cracker Barrels.  We had to beg for refills on ice tea and soda.  The manager was sorry.  I think we definitely were sorrier.  I was so excited that we finally had a Cracker Barrel here.  I'll continue to go to Kingman."}
{"text":"This is the third time we have received poor service from this restaurant. We went in at 8am this morning, they were not busy(please note this). Could not get a waitress to take a drink order for 15 minutes. When it was taken it took another 10 minutes to get our drinks (Coffee, Decaf coffee and Ice tea) Got breakfast 10 minutes later. Asked for more coffee. Never received. Stopped another waitress and she said she would have it right away, never received. Had to ask third waitress and she filled my coffee but not the decaf of my friend. Had to track down yet another waitress to get his and they never refilled my wife's Ice tea. Brought two jelly's for three people and had to ask 3 times to get more and it was just another two. Our waitress was more concerned with the table of 5 that came in after us. I have not received service this poor in years and it is the third time at this store. Will not be back soon....."}
{"text":"Our server was BONNIE. She was not very good nor professional. The food was good but the service was less than acceptable. Management was indifferent to the customer service provided by their staff. I am going to follow up with a letter to corporate."}
{"text":"I love the gift shop.becor is wonderful. 
Side at lunch yummy. I had chicken fried steak, sawmill gravy is great. Pancakes ,eyes,bacon perfect.
Very nice service,good food and had to take home left overs, .Spent over an hour in gift shop and spent some $$$.
Just a nice meal and visit."}
{"text":"When we first got to the restaurant there were people waiting so we knew there would be a wait. We told the lady that we had 9 people (not everyone had arrived yet so we knew we would be waiting a bit anyway) and she said it would be a 35 minute wait. That was fine because it gave everyone else a chance to get here. Finally everyone arrived and we ended up having an extra person, so I went up to the podium and let them know that we needed to add an extra person (so we had 10 people total). I watched the girl change the number from 9 to 10 and then asked how long it was gonna be and she said an additional 15 to 20 minutes. We continued waiting  and then they finally called our name. We went up to the podium and they said that we had changed from 6 to 10 (which was not true) and they only had a table for 6 available, and when we said \"no, we had 9 and changed to 10\" they were able to get us a table for 4 as well, so we said that was fine. They went to seat us at the tables, but they were far apart from each other. This was not gonna work for us because we are all family and needed to be together. So we told them that we would wait for the table for 10 but then they then said it was going to be another 20 to 25 minutes for the table. We were outraged so we left because this should not have happened. This was terrible service! Do not come here with large groups of people!!!!!"}
{"text":"I experienced my first Cracker Barrel in a cross country drive from FL to TX, years ago. Not much has changed except for the year on the calendar. Great back then and still great now.
I love the rocking chairs and super-sized checkers to play while you wait out front. You get a feeling of nostalgia like it is based on how old General Stores used to be run back in the day. Especially with the decor items as they use a lot of antique items and signage. Lots of fun items to peruse and buy. I love that they have old-timey candy in stock. Great selection of holiday gifts that aren't too common.

We checked in at the hostess station. There was a little bit of a wait for those who had 3 or more in a group. But we, the dynamic hiking duo, were seated promptly.
Our waitress, Lorena, was fantastic. Super helpful, quick and efficient. She made great recommendations. Brought our drinks and I would say breakfast came about 15 minutes later. Piping hot and just what we ordered. Everything was delicious. Large portions, too. Enough for two meals and that's what I did. Had a to-go box. Lorena kept my friend's coffee cup topped off and got me an ice tea to go.  
This is a busy place and definitely favorited by the elderly crowd. It is very accommodating and easy to get around if you have mobility issues. I was nicely surprised that everyone was conversing with each other and didn't have their faces buried in cell phones!
The hostess and wait staff is wonderful. Their bussing staff, efficient. The managers, I spotted at least two, were jumping right in, helping out, and keeping everything running smooth.
You have to take your check back out to the  cashiers by the hostess station. And yes, you will have a look-see one more time at the consumables. lol 
I look forward to my next visit in the near future.:)"}
{"text":"I don't care, I love Cracker Barrel.  Hardly a thing on the menu that I wouldn't eat.  Its just regular food, but stuff I can't be bothered to make on my own.  I usually get pancakes or their dinner special of the day.  The butter baked chicken is out of this world and the Sunday Fried Chicken was super good.  
Don't hate."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!! The waitresses all help one another and share tables. Wonderful staff!  If you look up from your table three would come running to ask what they can do to make it better.  Finally somewhere you can go and there is ample parking in Las Vegas!!! This place is the best!!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed i waited 6 weeks to try this place the food not fresh the servixe gowever was really good however i wont be back."}
{"text":"This place was so cute! The food was so good! The prices were amazing! Came here for lunch and ordered the campfire bbq chicken. It was amazing! On the table they had these peg board games you can play and also purchase from their huge store that you enter through. This place was so big and filled with so much novelties! The waitresses were super friendly and provided great service! Definitely enjoyed my first experience here!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, but I was skeptical about trying the Vegas location after only having it in the South. Well it was just as great! We came for an early dinner with the kids. Our waitress was so patient, helpful & sweet! The food was as delicious as ever, and of course we had a great time shopping afterwards in the gift shop! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great and some of the food was really good. However some of the food came out cold and missing items despite the fact that they were not busy.  We were going to tell the waiter, but he never came back to check on us.

We'll go back and try it again though because of our better experience elsewhere. The store inside was also wonderful. I just wish all of the food was consistently good."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight. Got seated by Alexis M who was super friendly and suggested the chicken and dumplings. I'm was very good.  All the servers that served our table were extra friendly.  Love this southern comfort food and all the sides.  Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this restaurant and finally did while traveling. I was so disappointed. There food is greasy and so unhealthy. The chicken was equivalents to a fried chicken Pattie you can buy a bag of 10 for 6 bucks in your local grocery isle. The corn muffins were tasteless. Coleslaw was ok but you get a tiny little portion. I will never go back. The music was annoying too, some gospel, some old school country."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great here...very country. The service was awesome and the food was piping hot!

The quality of the food was very generic though. I don't think the cooks are at fault here, it's just the way the food was bought. **Think cafeteria food... no flavor, bulk items, and pretty....well generic.** 

Keep in mind, you're paying for the experience, not so much the food. 

Try Bill Johnson's, they seem to have a better food."}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel several times before, it's never been a particularly amazing experience just solid chain restaurant comfort food. But this experience was particularly unenjoyable because my order was messed up twice. It was pretty simple, the Old Timer's breakfast with bacon and over medium eggs. The bacon came almost 10 minutes after the food arrived initially and my eggs were cold when they arrived. I don't mean luke warm, I mean they were so cold they got to that weird rubbery consistency eggs get when they've sit too long and there is nothing worse to me than cold eggs. So I asked if I could get some new eggs and the waitress was very nice and put in another order. They took 10 minutes so I was almost done with my meal and when they were brought out they were sunny side up and barely cooked through. I had an eggless breakfast which isn't the worse thing in the world but after the incredibly long wait and considering it was Father's Day it would have been nice to the meal go on without a hitch. Overall it was a mediocre experience and hopefully next year my dad will pick somewhere else for Father's Day breakfast."}
{"text":"Sad to see the manager doesn't see or read Yelp.  Look how little people are giving reviews now.  The bad ones are still up and no reply to them.  Not what you expect from this company."}
{"text":"Home country feeding as usual. From the grits, biscuits and gravy, chicken fried chicken, cheesy potatoes, Mac n cheese, mash potatoes with brown gravy, rainbow trout, dumplins, steak big breakfast, corn bread muffins... It's as good as it gets! Good ole country eats. When in Buckeye, Arizona .... We'll definitely stop by again. Thanks for the good eats!"}
{"text":"Southern hospitality at its finest can be found at Cracker Barrel. I actually expected a few shocked stares (being Asian and all), but the servers moved right along and treated us with amazing service.

They're buttermilk biscuits were heavenly - they came out flaky, warm, and utterly soft. Chicken Fried chicken was fried deliciously, and came with three sides. I had Mac n' Cheese, steak fries, and steamed broccoli to make myself feel better about the heavy meal I was eating. 

Cracker Barrel isn't the place to go for gourmet meals, so don't expect anything but good ole fashioned Southern comfort food. SUPER filling through, so expect nearly 1.5X of your daily calories to be consumed in one meal."}
{"text":"The location is fantastic since my friends live right next door, but I wasn't a fan of the food and service. I've been to other Cracker Barrels throughout Phoenix, and I was looking forward to their sweet tea and biscuits but this place didn't cut it. Service was terrible! We asked for refills, never received it, asked for napkins, nada. Food wasn't great, we ended up leaving without finishing up our breakfast, and that's a first at CB! I still love CB and hope the next time I'm in the area, I'll experience the same o'l service I always look forward to.  Oh, you have to stop by the store, their apple gummy bears are yummy!"}
{"text":"Have been to this location several times and twice with the same server who is just awful.  Older woman with long brown hair named Beverly.  If you get her, ask to be reseated or you will be forgotten about, get cold food delivered and extremely poor service.  i'm actually quite surprised she still has a job.  I usually don't like to complain but had to let the management know what poor service in her section and it wasn't the first time.  Never again... Will go to Culvers and get better service and a hot meal with a smile."}
{"text":"Bleh.  How do I describe - it's like a cheap museum with the gift shop at the end that you have to go through to get out.  The eggs were greasy.  The sausage was greasy.  The toast was not toasted completely.  The service is right out of the TV show Alice - \"kiss my grits, mel'.  Don't expect great service or even digestible food.  Pass on this one.  Not worth the time it takes to park and get through the gift shop."}
{"text":"I went here for my very first time on a Sunday afternoon with my husband. We knew they were going to be busy since it was the Sunday brunch crowd. We waited an hour and thirty minutes for a table just for the 2 of us. The wait wasn't too bad, we looked around the store and sat on their rocking chairs to kill some time. After our long wait, we were called on the overhead and got seated right away. They have a fun little game on the table to play to kill more time while you wait for your food. The service was good and the food was even better. My husband got the French toast and I got a children's chicken and dumplings and biscuits and gravy. I defiantly recommend the chicken and dumplings."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. We were eating late so the restaurant wasn't packed. We were seated immediately and received our food quickly. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. The store staff was friendly too. The hostess was rather unpleasant. For some reason, she was hesitant to provide us with individual breakfast menus, but that was the only bad part of our visit."}
{"text":"My CB review, I went in and signed up for a table for one. One hour and ten minute wait, to be expected around 2ish pm on a Sunday! I wandered around the retail store as it was hot outside. I was standing by the food items CB sells that they also serve in the dining room. A retail employee named Kathy approached me and asked if I had questions about the food merchandise. WOW, was this lady knowledgeable about every product we discussed, and even had tips about what goes best together. Next thing I know, my name is being called and I have a vast knowledge about the retail food than I did before my interaction with Kathy! I went to the host stand and I was immediately seated. The dining room was packed with parties of every size. Lisa took good care of me. She was prompt in coming to my table and then bringing my sweet tea. I ordered the Sunday special which is yummy boneless fried chicken. My sides were Hash brown casserole and mashed potatoes. It was excellent. Oh, plus corn muffins, too. A manager stopped by my table and checked to make sure my meal was good, my only negative comment is the noise level is very loud. I am happy CB has made it to Las Vegas! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"What's the best part of going to Costco early on a Sunday mornimg?? Breakfast at Cracker Barrel!!  Yum! Never a bad experience or meal here. We got Grandpas fried breakfast, one with country fried steak., the other with the chicken fried chicken. Both were delicious, but i think the chicken was a smidge better. I love the grits there. Little butter & salt is heaven.  Our waitress was great as was the service. I can't wait til our next Costco visit"}
{"text":"I worked at a Cracker Barrel in Ohio back in 97', loved the job, the food and the atmosphere.  Moved back to California in 98', and as we are Cracker Barrel deficient in Cali, I longed for it.  Every time I visit my Dad in Arizona first stop is always Cracker Barrel.  Last years experience was a little disappointing, but this year takes the cake!  Our server was very sweet, but either very overwhelmed or not very good at her job.  We arrived at noon today and met my father on his lunch break, it was not busy by any definition of the word.  It took forever to get anything and everything.  My Dad ended up 20 minutes late getting back to work just waiting for the food.  I had to ask for ketchup, jam, extra ranch, silverware, etc.  I get fries, no ketchup, ask and it takes so long the fries are cold.  Ask for jam, again, takes so long the biscuit is now cold.  My daughters food came out covered in sauce even though we asked for it on the side and didn't bother saying anything because we literally didn't have all day to wait for it to be fixed.  I would have loitered and had coffee and dessert,  but was so disappointed that I decided to leave.  You need to pay at the cashier on the way out and as I was giving exact change I just left it in front of the cashier on the stand and told her it was exact, which then elicited a dirty look from the manager, who by the way I hadn't seen once in the dining room while everyone was needing and waiting for things.  I'm sure I will give it another shot as I'm addicted to the biscuits, but I'm pretty much over everything else!"}
{"text":"Food is just like I remember. Fun atmosphere. But make sure you have carved out about 3+ hours in your day for this experience. No points against for the wait time at all, it's just that Cracker Barrel is and never has been a five star experience. If you are ticked off about waiting then I'm sorry but it is the only one within 300 miles so wait do you expect? The only thing I can say is that they should have made the dining room much bigger than the other traditional stores. Other than that, a fun time and good cheap food!"}
{"text":"Last time I'll be here for a while. My wife and I have a four month old and since we had him we would come here for breakfast every other week or so. Today, there appeared to be a new lady at the front who just seemed dumber that dog slobber and she was clearly having trouble getting people checked in. We told her that we have a baby with a stroller. Even though we checked in online we still had three group seated before us that had just walked in. She insisted that we had to be shoved in the back corner of the dining room because of the stroller. I told her we have sat other places before and she said that we are a hazard and need to be out of their way. This is the most inconsistent place I've eaten at too. The food is hit and miss, they normally forget some part of our very basic order, and when this place opened it was originally packed but now on a Sunday morning at 10:00 the dining room isn't even close to full. The issue is the service and attitudes of the people that work here. The management needs to be replaced ASAP."}
{"text":"Great place for a southern breakfast.  Staff is pleasant, however long waits for seating."}
{"text":"Awful 45 mins to get eggs. Waitress never came by, stole a waiter to get drink refills. Told her we didn't like biscuits and gravy never offered toast to Don, brought b&g anyway, then told the people behind us they had just ran out of biscuits..SMH..  the sausage was off, spoiled, I hope I don't get sick, ate half a peice B4 I figured out what the taste was. (Don ate all his, but his might have been ok) Out of toilet ppr in ladies room, and men's room was apparently filthy. Was early & they weren't busy when we got there. We're getting busy by the time we finally got food. Now I know why it's been years since we ate at a cracker barrel. Dennys next time for sure. 

Should have not went in when we saw a nearly empty parking lot on a Sunday morning.."}
{"text":"Yuk... I'm from the south... Crap food served here to ignorant public. Cold and dry for breakfast? Coffee was OK. Horrible grits, served cold. Horrible white gravy, cold and tasteless. Dry ham.. Dry sausage patty... Over easy eggs were served cold too. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Ambience?
You can hear the screams from the roller coasters across the street.
Location?
In front of Carrowinds Amusement Park.
Food?
Dude, it's Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"A really great meal!! I had the grilled chicken tenderloins with hash brown casserole and green beans.  I was trying to be good by getting the grilled chicken and expected it to be meh but OMG they were so tender and flavorful and juicy.  Better than prob the fried chicken! The hash brown casserole is always a hit and I am glad they offer it all day, it is the side I never ever switch up.  The green beans were seasoned perfectly and I had some the next day for lunch and they were even better.  Husband had chicken fried chicken and it was superb. I like the chicken fried steak a bunch too.  For breakfast their pancakes are soooo good.  Good service and I was glad the sales people in the store didn't push product in an annoying way that I have seen in the past.  Always a hit for breakfast lunch or dinner!!!"}
{"text":"This is very good \"cafeteria style\" food. The store provides a very nostalgic feel and waitstaff is very courteous,  We went on a Sunday early afternoon and the wait was not as long as expected.  Food quality was good but obviously pre-prepared."}
{"text":"Against my better judgment, I gave this place two chances. The first time, the steak was overcooked. The second time I tried the country fried steak. I figured with it being a specialty of theirs it would be cooked properly. I was wrong. It too was dry. The hash brown casserole tasted more like rice than potato. I asked for jam for the biscuits that never came. The saving grace was the fried apples. They would have been better if they had been peeled though. Overall, I would say the problem is that their menu is so large that they don't learn how to execute any dish properly. As a positive, I would say the place is good if you have someone who has a sensitive stomach. Their food is bland so no irritation happening there."}
{"text":"Sunrise Sampler...always have this when I go.  Always good, always the same. A back to basics style of breakfast x10.
Just know there's usually a wait on the weekends...duh, put your name in and look around there store."}
{"text":"After a few years and maybe six visits I won't go back. It's easily noticed the quality has cheapened up and just not same. The chicken fried chicken, no where near as good as years ago. First hardly warm and on this huge oval plate by itself with small amount of already congiled gravy. Just not appealing...We had a party of ten easy orders and two waitresses didn't quite nail it if you know what I mean. I was obviously paying bill and my service was terrible not even a refill? Until I asked! 119.99 for ten to eat is OK with half ordering water but just not same food quality... Sorry!"}
{"text":"Jesse the server is the best server Cracker Barrel has ever employeed! Jesse goes way above and beyond for his clients. Very professional and greatly personable!! Way to go Jesse!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch with my mother. The beans and turnip greens were good and flavorful. Our waitress was attentive and helpful. The restroom, however, was NOT clean. You could see that it had not been thoroughly cleaned in quite awhile. That should be a nightly job for staff."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times.  I can't say it has been consistent.  There are alot of options and I believe the menu was recently upgraded.  The service was good despite appearing to be short staffed.  The server graciously fixed a small mistake with the order.  My plate was missing my side of hashbrowns.  She handled it well.  I will go back and hopefully have a more detailed review to update you on."}
{"text":"Great customer service!! Had the steak was cooked perfectly. The fried apples are killer good i could eat them all day. Took my kids and the quickly brought me a high chair and a place for the infant carseat so A++ on that. The store was a bit pricey for my taste wanted to buy my 2year old a shirt and it was 25 dollars. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We have only been to this location once. The server was very friendly, but seemed slightly rushed and behind. It took about 45 minutes for our food and half my order was forgot. I honestly think when we had visited the location had just opened and staff was still training."}
{"text":"I've had several meals here over the past few years and its always a favorite stop when I come to town.  Great service and food.  Priced right with good value all around.  Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Please don't waste your time or money here. The food quality is really poor. You can find much better breakfast places in town that are worth going to over this place. It's crowded and you're forced to wait around either inside their gift shop or outside on the patio before your table is ready. My biggest concern with them though is how cheap the food tasted, like nothing there was made by hand. It all tasted either store bought or frozen and pre-cooked, like they just reheated the food. It was really unpleasant."}
{"text":"This place always the best. The food awesome.  The service great. Perfect! And even on sunday we don't have to wait too long to got sit. Better than than the one in Glendale area."}
{"text":"My friend says he LOVESSSS this places and wanted to go so I said ok....

The wait was told to us 20 minutes but was less not bad didn't mind.... out server was GREAT no complaints on her she was AMAZING 

I ordered the meatloaf with Mac n cheese greens and a side salad my side salad came out first was normal for a side salad no complaints 

I guess they don't give out complimentary bread you HAVE TO ASK so make sure you ask if you are not given any!!!!! 

The wait for food is LONGGGGGG.... I got my food and tried the greens first I'm a greens lover .... blahhhhh NO FLAVOR WHAT SO EVER AND COLD...I tried the Mac and cheese next it was \"ok\" wasn't amazing but wasn't bad.... 
my meatloaf was barely warm :( I took two bites and couldn't do I would rather feed it to my dog honestly!!! I won't go out of my way to visit here again! 

My service again was GREAT And the people working were AMAZING but the food got to step it up no one likes tasteless food and cold ....."}
{"text":"Service was great - really friendly server. Food was good. Enjoyed lunch and will be back again.  Thanks for a nice meal!"}
{"text":"Sitting here 30 mins before waitress says they are out of chicken salad and it will be 10 more mins.  That was 20 mins ago.  Then they bring food and they are out of cornbread.  Food was mediocre.  Manager comped entire meal."}
{"text":"Family tradition to eat at Cracker Barrel on the road trips. Always something for everyone. From breakfast all day to traditional southern meat and twos, it's hard to beat the Cracker Barrel.

This location was solid and quite busy as are most of them around the country. Service was prompt and courteous with food quality on par with other locations. Great location just off Billy Graham Parkway and 85 on the west side of Charlotte near the airport."}
{"text":"Sunday morning early... most of Twinsburg doesn't open until 8 or 10 on a Sunday... this is one of the 2 options for breakfast early.

If you have been to one of this chain... you have been to all of them...

Register / store staff - seemed to be distracted / confused... asked us if we needed help when we were standing at a register with items on the counter waiting to pay... and then walked around the counter and rang us up.

Waitress - refilled our drinks in a timely manner... there was only 1 other person in the whole restaurant so there wasn't much else to do but keep our glasses filled.

Food - Hashbrown casserole is supposed to be the calling card at breakfast... this version was bone dry.

They don't serve maple syrup anymore... they serve \"Natural Syrup\"... huh? 55% maple, 45% corn syrup... barely could taste any maple... I guess we haven't been to a  Cracker Barrel in ~ 3 years... this is a sad turn of events.

French toast was over coated with egg... I wouldn't have gotten the Mama's French Toast combo thing with over easy eggs if I knew that the french toast was basically scrambled eggs with a gummy bread filling... and syrup with barely any maple taste? Not good.

Bread for the Egg Basket (aka in a Frame) was really dry... the butter like mounds from the French Toast helped.... but not much.

Given that we didn't enjoy our meal when there was no one else ordering... we won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing I loved the biscuits and corn bread and my plate of chicken fried steak with Mac and cheese and fried apples with a side of the most amazing chicken dumplings I have ever had it was my first time here and I will defiantly be back here our waiter was awesome to the service was great"}
{"text":"I have always loved cracker barrel as my choice for breakfast.  I always get the chicken fried chicken breakfast or the dinner with fried okra & corn. Combine it with sweet tea & its just like being back in the south. This location is hit or miss with the service but the food is pretty consistent."}
{"text":"#1 the prices are reasonable....menu is large....food is very good....We were greeted in a very friendly manner with a very exuberant and lively host...the manager greeted not only us but many diners....several servers that were not our server offered us more coffee...But our server also offered VERY good service...his name is Seth.  Seth is new to Vegas and the West in general.  He is 20 years old and from Kentucky.  I am sure this is a big deal coming west and getting a job with so few hours.  So anyone lucky enough to be served by Seth, please give him encouragement and a hand up.  If people did that along my sons path in life....I would surely appreciate it."}
{"text":"Eating dinner here and I had to stop eating my pie to let the internet know how awesome our server, Laura g, was!"}
{"text":"I really love this restaurant. I'm so happy we have one in Las Vegas now. The service is always great and the food is consistently delicious. Today I wasn't asked if I wanted sweet or salty ham which was a bit disappointing.
We realized that corporate was in the building which was presumably making everyone nervous. My boyfriend and I have worked in restaurants for many years when we were younger and it's clear that the corporate suits do not belong in the restaurant, or the kitchen. As we ate we watched these guys literally standing in their suits in the doorway of the kitchen. If I was a server I would have \"accidentally\" spilled a tray on them. If you're not helping get out of the way. This place is always packed and the staff is running it like a well oiled machine. Just let them do their job!"}
{"text":"The wait was a little long but they were busy. Food was very good. I appreciated my server  helping me decide what to order. The food came out fast and hot. The only negative things are I asked for water no lemon but they brought me water with lemon anyways and they did not check up on us enough for refills."}
{"text":"Came here expecting the food to be horrible cuz all the bad reviews.. so it turn out better then what we expected.. thank god!! Hehe ..  

Not the best breakfast we had , but the atmosphere is nice and their little shop that's attached to the restaurant is cute.  

We came here at 8:40am so there was only a 15 mins. Wait time.. phew !!  The food took a long time to come out.  

My hubby had the country fried steak and that was alright, it comes w a side of gravy, two biscuits and grits(not a fan).

I got the sampler platter.. IDO NOT like their sausage patties.. weird taste and texture, never had that kind of sausage before, but their shredded potatoes w cheese taste good.

Average price for any breakfast restaurant, my first and last time coming here !!"}
{"text":"This place has some serious down home cookin! Everything was fresh, hot and delicious. The blueberry pancakes were to die for. Nice, unique, ambiance with smiling attentive staff everywhere.  Prices were fair especially for the quality. My new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic place to go with family or friends for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Great place to go with a group or party too. They have a nice store too for gifts."}
{"text":"Can't even review this place.  Love this place when visited in Arizona and were excited when one opened up here near son.  Many visits...then this time, family reunion vacation they could not accommodate us.  13 was too much and we were willing to wait.  Also second time they said someone in wheelchair was a fire hazard because sticking out.  They could seat us at 2 tables but not at same time but still special request.  So it's ironic that my son who works for big company nearby can get a big group seated for meetings?  He won't be back, I won't be back.  Hopefully the new one by us in California will be much nicer.  I'll book my meetings there!  Sorry Cracker Barrel that we love you so much and my family is too big."}
{"text":"We went to cracker barrel on 2815 E Craig road today on 11/10/17 for lunch it was very cold inside the restaurant plus my lunch order was hot roast beef sandwich they had hardly any brown gravy on my plate they get a D grade from me today on friday11/10/17 We never got our fresh biscuits too I hope it's better next time"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I first had it in Nashville and when I saw that there were Cracker Barrel's in Phoenix, I almost did back flips. They offer good food, for great prices. This is comfort food, people, Mama's home cooking kind of food, probably made with Crisco and coffee that only needs 2 creams and a sugar. I appreciate the \"store\" part as it keeps me from trying to sit with strangers in my haste to eat."}
{"text":"Poor customer service here. Every time I come here it gets worse and worse and worse finally we just had enough of it we got up and we left and we're never going to come back"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we have a Cracker Barrel here! I had one back when I lived in North Carolina and I missed it so bad. I was overjoyed when I found out about ours here in Vegas. It taste the same too!"}
{"text":"The service is wonderful and the food is great! The price is good for the portion size and the amount of items in the meal. My favorite is the Grandpa Fried Breakfast! Fried chicken, eggs, biscuits, grits and hash brown casserole all for $8-$10. (i don't remember exactly)"}
{"text":"Service is extremely poor. Waited over 10 minutes and never was asked what we wanted to drink. There were four other tables waiting ahead of us without drink orders. We left and nobody stopped to ask why. The cashiers just stood there and watched people leave. If you have no place to be this is the place for you.  I won't be going back to this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"Pros: Clean, great service, good prices, and nice country store with neat stuff to look at. Coca Cola Cake!

Cons: The food was equivalent to Sizzlers salad bar. Even the cornbread was a little dull. It was somewhat dry and flavorless. I expected fried chicken breasts and got some weird boneless chicken leftovers fried with a side of overly sweet syrup. There was an odd taste to the country friend steak and the gravy on the mashed potatoes. Their mac n cheese and hashbrown casserole weren't bad but definitely bland and store bought. 

We were pretty let down by the food, but I will say, The Coca Cola chocolate cake was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for my first time. Everyone told me to try it..I was so disappointed. I got biscuits & gravy and the gravy taste like flour. Their was a hair on my plate my French toast was not cooked all the way. And my bacon & eggs were cold. I won't ever come here again."}
{"text":"The Cracker Barrel's Country Boy Breakfast and Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast are the best!!!"}
{"text":"Been to Cracker Barrels from \"sea to shining sea\", this Las Vegas, NV , store is the closest ...to the Pacific Ocean...and it should be \"deep sixed.\"

The worst service, I have ever received at this confused, excuse laden, unexcusable mess, called a restaurant!, I was so excited that CB had come further west but alas!  Not a good location. 

 In Las  Vegas, there are 1000's of restaurants and buffets....why do you suck?????

The first waiter disappeared after she brought biscuits and touched them with her booboo, bandaid, hand.. another waiter and another waiter, topped off by snotty manager, D@#e, who villified everything I told him about our lackluster disaster of an experience.... (the 4 different wait staff asking me, \"what dressing do you want again?\")  

ME:  FRENCH.
WAIT STAFF:  RANCH?

My salad comes after my meal, no dressing on the side, 2 tablespoons of green beans, argumentative D@#e, the manager,  likes to tell customers\" what is\" and \"what is not\"...bossing customers around like bad, little children...so no napkins for you!!!

Then he accuses me of calling him an idiot....whaaaa???? 

Do not clean up the restaurant and tell us why we have no salt, pepper or napkins, because WE DON'T CARE!!!...YOU ARE OPEN UNTIL 10 p.m. SO GET ORGANIZED!!"}
{"text":"Anyone familiar with my reviews knows that I'm a big fan of Cracker Barrel and usually find most all locations to be consistent in their food quality and service; however, this location is an anomaly in that it falls somewhat short in both areas. Of the many that I have reviewed,  it is actually the closest to our home, but on our three trips there we have had issues during each. Sadly, I can't recommend this one. 
."}
{"text":"This location has always been a reliable location for a good meal and a welcome respite on our frequent travels between Charlotte, NC and Virginia. The staff is always friendly and attentive and the meals are always prepared well, both signs of good management. Of course we especially like the General Store area which makes waiting a lot less painless and dessert-to-go (from its old timey candy collection) a lot more challenging to pass on. Our family has been stopping here for years."}

I am always amazed they can serve as much food as they do for under $15. The portions at this one seem to be bigger than usual. The wait staff was extremely friendly. The only complaint was my salad came out and then two minutes later the main course."}
{"text":"I really like the breakfast here at Cracker Barrel. It has plenty of items and you can make changes if desired. The last couple of times though the service was somewhat slow. It took a while to get our food on both occasions. The last time the server never brought out the coffee and we waited for her to come back to the table. She brought out our food order and we asked again about coffee. She apologized that she had been waiting for our food to be ready and didn't hear us order the coffee. You know how it feels to really want that cup of coffee and you are waiting and waiting! Other than that the breakfast was great and just what we wanted. So there are some improvements that can be made but I will still go back."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has some great food at reasonable prices.  

If you are used to southern cooking like I am ( My Grandma ) then this is the place for you.  I love their Chicken N Dumplins !

You can not go wrong at Cracker Barrel.  Yes, I'm a fan !"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW it is so great to have Cracker Barrel here in Las Vegas. 
Normally I don't go right in a new restaurant opening because there is so much chaos however we couldn't wait. 
So we went of course as I knew there would be a wait one hour and fifteen minutes however it was worth the wait, we kept busy looking around the store bought a few items the time went quickly. One hour and ten minutes later we were called spot on time they seem to be very good at judging their times.  
We came in on the fifth day of the opening this place was packed. All the employees were very upbeat smiles eager to help even with all that was going on the employees would take time to make sure you were comfortable and could help you in any way.  
We were seated server came over right away introduced her self with a beautiful smile very positive attitude her name was Sarai R. Even though she was very busy she came by checking on everything food coffee etc. she did an excellent job we could not have been happier with the food and service.  
Even though it was the fifth day and the restaurant section was moving like a well oiled machine the corporate staff ( red shirts) were working harder than any I have ever seen no one missed a move if something needed to be done it was done it didn't make any difference if it was your job or station or not it was it was taken care of by every employee regardless of station. 
I n my forty years in the food service industry I have seen very few openings this smooth 
Thank you for a job well done. To all employees THANK YOU FOR A JOB WELL DONE.
Will see you in the future.
Harold and Renee Christian"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times.  It's a favorite of our children.  The wait staff is a bit iffy sometimes, but the food has always been consistent.  They have the cutest gift shop and their prices are great!"}
{"text":"Country store is nice. Service was good.  Food continues to go downhill."}
{"text":"Walking into this place feels like walking into my home. You might be wondering why it feels like my home, and that's because I used to live in a barn. No, really, I did. The best thing about coming here is the cookin'. If the wife could cook this good, she would probably get more kisses from me. The pancakes taste like pancakes. The bacon is very crunchy and thick. The hashbrown casserole is very hashbrown casseroley. It tastes the way food should taste! I would recommend this place!

A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN!"}
{"text":"When i first heard of this place i was a little disturbed by the name, but once i got the nerve to go inside  i was impressed. They have yummy pancakes. They are diabetic friendly and they offer Sugar Free Maple Syrup. I didn't see many crackers around, but they do offer soup, so they might have them in the back. They also have a store area where they sell interesting knick-knacks and other strange items. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that a Cracker Barrel opened up in Las Vegas, especially on my side of town. Regardless of the fact that there is still a 45 minute wait, I love this place. Now my bf and I don't have to drive to St. George, Utah when we want CB. 

You know all the food that makes America obese and is bad for you? They have it all here!! Biscuits, grits, country fried steak for breakfast and fried catfish, burgers and mac and cheese are some options offered on the menu. Breakfast is served all day and they have daily specials for lunch and dinner. The breakfast and lunch/dinner menus offer an extensive amount of sides to customize your meal. 

I'm pretty basic and always opt for breakfast items. The sausage, eggs and bacon are pretty basic and nothing to write home about. So why do we keep coming back?! I love the PANCAKES and biscuits. Omg the pancake!! They are fluffy and buttery. What makes these stand out is that they cook them in a way where the edges are crispy. I freaking love it. And no matter what time of day we go, we always get the biscuits. They are warm and soft and are delicious with apple butter. 

And once you are finished with your 1000 calorie meal, walk around the country store to look at all the little knick knacks and candy they have to offer. All of the employees we have encountered have been warm and friendly. And despite the longer than average wait to be seated, our food has always arrived in a timely manner. 

I am definitely a fan!! Already craving another pancake!!!!"}
{"text":"Their buttermilk fried chicken is the special on Sunday. I ordered it with two sides, one with mashed potatoes the other corn. The breasts were too large for me to eat the whole meal, & I ended up taking 1/2 of everything home for round two! The coating on the fried chicken is delicious and has a little bit of a spicy kick to it, which I can't describe from what. I love the cornbread muffins here! This place was worth the wait. I suggest you put your name in two hours ahead of time before you want to eat. Then go shopping at Bass or the Premium Outlet stores and come back when your wait time is up. We were told two hours, came back & were seated in 5 minutes. Stick with the chicken finger dinner for the little kids. If it doesn't look like a chicken finger, they probably won't eat the delicious fried chicken and you will waste your money! The chicken fingers are good. My 9 year old ate them with a side of fries. He also had left overs for later. I only wish that locals could call in reservations instead of driving down there! I think management should consider this. They could also take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready."}
{"text":"This is a newer store, and they need to fix a few things! It's my understanding that this store has been so busy that they have set several records with the company!

This store is much smaller than the others. The wait times are lengthy. The food is great. Service could be better. Get rid of this rectangular serving trays and get the ovals with some tray jacks! The servers also need to be able to be able to cash people out. This will eliminate the long lines in the store. 

We just weren't impressed. Sorry folks, gonna have to give them a few months to work out the kinks before I try it again!"}
{"text":"Completely overrated! Went this morning, for the first time. My friends have been raving about Cracker Barrel, for years, in the states that they live in. Worst chicken fried steak, I've ever had. Potatoes were stuck together, and hard. The runner rolled her eyes when I asked for ketchup, Chalula, napkins, and pepper, but there was nothing on the table to dress your meal. The meal was lukewarm, and forgettable. The server was nice, and the store was cute, but unfortunately, didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"I am always happy with the food here! Love coming with my sig other when it's not busy. Some of the waiters could do a better job of looking cleanly though I must admit."}
{"text":"I can honestly not remember the last time that I had been to Cracker Barrel, so I was not quite sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed lunch there. I was surprised that there was a wait at 1pm on a Thursday afternoon, but the store definitely helps with the wait. It was fun walking around and seeing all of the interesting stuff that they carry. My two year old loved the Christmas decorations and of course the toy corner. We were seated after about 15 minutes and were immediately seen by our server who took our drink order and offered us biscuits and cornbread muffins. Their menu was quite extensive and I was pleased with quite a few healthy options. My one warning on the menu is to watch out on their sides, there is a lot of hidden sugar in items you don't expect to find it. I was immensely impressed with the service. He was very attentive and our drinks were never dry. He even offered us drinks to go! Best service I have had in a long time anywhere! My main complaints are that the restaurant is very loud and the deceptive menu items, otherwise it was great."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Host made us wait and the 7 person group ahead of us wait. There were about 6 tables total with people seated at them. We were seated, our waiter had no personality, not even a smile, didn't even tell us her name. Took our order, didn't bring entire meals, the second time she came out we weren't even a quarter way into our meal and she gave us our ticket/check. Personally that's rude, makes me want to hurry up and eat then jus leave, she came a total of 4 times. The last time to pick up our plates. Never coming to this Cracker Barrel again, and it is the closest to me, but I'd rather drive the extra 10 miles to the one with better service and a smile!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is my safe place... this place is the mother fucking best!!!!! Love the games, love the food and love the hunnies!!! Keep it up my dawgssss"}
{"text":"Good 'ol fashion home cooked meals served here!"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out cuz I heard it was good. Thank goodness there was no wait being it was lunch time on a Friday. Waitress went missing in action  for a bit we had to flag another waitress down to get what we needed. I ordered the Mama's French toast it was yummy it came with eggs and choice of bacon or sausage I got the bacon of course. Tried the biscuit & gravy ugh I am no fan. Fish & chips on the other hand was deelicious my sister & bro in law reaction said that much. I'd definitely go here again just to try another dish lol."}
{"text":"Love the biscuits and the apple butter on the side. Their take out is pretty good and fast. However if you get eggs or pancakes I suggest you eat in. 

The smokes sausage patty is not my fav but that's the good thing about getting their breakfast sampler, you get every meat to try along with biscuits/toast, hash brown casserole/grits and apples."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed eating at Cracker Barrel. Their location in north Phoenix is near Interstate 17 and Loop 101 near the Castle. You need to drive around the freeway to access the large parking lot.

This location is similar to most with a large country store and restaurant. Even on a busy Sunday morning, our party was seated fast. Very hot coffee came fast with a huge menu full of very reasonably priced Southern food. The dining room is very country and very loud.

For breakfast I had biscuits and gravy with Bacon and fried apples. This large meal was on the \"lighter appetites\" menu and was very delicious and filling. My friends enjoyed their large breakfast plates. Service is fast and friendly even with several young and very picky eaters.

You can buy a lot of country stuff in the gift shop, although most of it is pretty overpriced. They have a great selection of candy and soda too. Overall it's  a great place for a meal on your trip or just after church."}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to go when I am back home with the family for breakfast. I'll make this review quick. You can't go wrong with any of the big breakfast meal. The Old Timer is my favorite. You get your choice of eggs, hash-browns/Apples, biscuits and gravy, grits, and your choice of meat all for under $8. 

Went this morning and had great service especially for such a large group. The waitress was really nice and attentive. The food came at a great time. We didn't have to wait to long after we ordered to receive our food."}
{"text":"I'd give It a Most Improved Rating for Service

My wife and late Sister-in-Law loved this place for brunch after Church on Sunday.

I hated it because of the Service, Food was always good but service was exceptionally slow to where it was painful just to go.

Finally relented and went back last Sunday for Brunch.  It was crowded as usual but the appear to have learned how to better manage the crowd.  When I walked in and looked at the crowd, I expected at least half and hour wait.  

We were seated in just over 15 minutes and our server was right there to give us menus and take our orders.  I had the Steak and Eggs and they came our perfect in a very reasonable amount of time.

Too early to give them an approval rating because this could have been a aberation but if they continue like this time, they are well on the their way to getting just that."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and helpful. The food is very good and there is not one bad choice on the menu. I'm more of a fan of the lunch but the breakfast is very good also. I've never had any complaints about this restaurant and it feels very homey. COME TO CRACKER BARREL"}
{"text":"My parents and I stopped in to eat dinner after flying into the airport, but sorry we did. The waitress (Carissa) seemed to take awhile to come back and take our order after bringing us our drinks, then we proceeded to wait about 30mins in which our meal never came. We never even got the biscuits/rolls and the waitress only came by once to say \"our food should be out shortly\"--that was 15 minutes before we left. Still wonder if our food ever got cooked before she realized we had skipped town. 
Have had great food/experience with Cracker Barrel, but this was not excusable (especially since it was a Monday night and the place wasn't busy)."}
{"text":"This location is a dumpster fire. I'm pretty proficient in Cracker Barrel culture. One would say an enthusiast, even. Before they opened in Vegas it wasn't unusual for me to drive to the St. George or Kingman locations. I drive across country every year and have stopped at almost all of the Cracker Barrel's along Interstates 40, 75 and 95. I choose to stop at Cracker Barrel in my travels because they are generally clean, safe, consistent and an excellent value. It's a simple formula. We're seated, we order, our food comes and so does the check. It's usually a 25-30 minute process. There's usually a person running around refilling drinks. This location is hands down the worst Cracker Barrel I've ever encountered. I've never spent less than an hour here, not including wait time to be seated. The food takes FOREVER. Every waiter or waitress I've encountered takes the order and then dissipates into some vortex, never to be seen again. You're lucky to get a refill on a beverage. I've always had to hunt someone down so I can get my check after sitting a ridiculous amount of time with dirty dishes and empty drinks. I've been to this location about 10 times. 10 times hoping they're working out their kinks.  10 dumpster fire type experiences. It just seems to get depressingly worse every time I go. Needless to say I will never set foot in this location ever again. I'll also encourage others to avoid this location like the plague."}
{"text":"It was just okay. The food didn't taste fresh and was only lukewarm.  I used to go to another one back east and i remembered it being so awesome- I brought my family boasting about this place and everyone left disappointed."}
{"text":"Generally Cracker Barrel is a decent restaurant to grab some good fake American food with good service. I'll keep it brief. I came on a Tuesday evening around 645 and informed the host that I would have a table of 10 around 7PM. He told me that it may be about 5 to 10 minutes so not a big deal. I gazed in the dining room and could see it was fairly empty. Some time went by and soon it was 715. I asked the host how much longer it would be and he clearly had forgot about my party as he was busy doing side work. I reminded him that we had been waiting and he assured me there were not tables. The dining room was still sparse and other smaller parties continued to get sat. Finally around 730 we got sat. However, the server originally tried to sit us at three different tables because they didn't want to get the completely open dining room dirty. Again there were other open, but dirty tables in the main dining room but they didn't understand how to coordinate that. I asked to speak to the manager and was greeted by someone that did nothing but give excuses and informed me that generally the customer was wrong and he had a hard job. My intent was to make him aware of the situation but after hearing excuses from him and no solution I informed him my family and I would never be back. Unfortunately my family had a lot of old people with us and wanted to stay. The servers were adequate but not great and kept forgetting about who ordered what. The food wasn't bad but horrible customer service and completely incompetent management."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel !

But I've come here several times and been forgotten about. The wait staff is always nice though.

They're food is always good I love Sunday fried chicken :) yum"}
{"text":"Waiter is terrific, however, the chef cannot inform customers sooner about sold out items on the menu. My family & I waited for 25 minutes for our meal. Then had been informed about the sold out item for my grandmother who then had to reorder and continue to wait longer for her food."}
{"text":"Awww man, we were looking forward to the grand opening of this place because we would go to it often back home but unfortunately we're left disappointed with the food and service.

Our order was wrong and the incorrect  food was brought to our table twice before they finally got the order right. The food was tasteless, small, very small portions and cold. My husband did not receive his order until the rest of my family had already eaten."}
{"text":"Excellent staff. Zachary very professional and attentive. I believe Janie was working register, and she was very sweet and personable. Food was well prepared and prompt."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Nice relaxing dinner after a day at Carowinds. It's convenient to the park and we know it will be good quality food"}
{"text":"Big Change for the Better

Have dined here many times heading to the airport with a bit of time on my hands. Biggest complaint was lack of service, particularly if I was pressed for time.

Things have changed and I suspect new management. 

Coming back from a long Thanksgiving Weekend in Marietta GA, we decided to grab a quick lunch before getting home.  My wife likes Cracker Barrel and it was with some reluctance that I agreed. Reluctance was from issues noted above.

We arrived a few minutes before 11am and the lot was packed.  I'm recovering from a hip injury so my wife left me off a the front door while she parked the car.  Walked in and put my name on the list and was told it would be about 10-15 minutes to which I said fine.

Went back outside and sat down in one of the rockers when my wife came up, I gave her the time estimate and she went inside to brouse and shop. No sooner that this had occurred than they called our name.  5 minutes at most.

From there, the service continued throughout our visit.  Watching tte dynamics, even the manager would jump in and bus tables to keep it moving.

My wife ordered the Roast Beef Dinner with Mashed Potatoes and Fried Okra. The Roast Beef is one of her favorites because it reminds here of the Roast Beef  her Mother used to make.

I had the Chicken Dinner which was two boneless Fried Chicken Breast with sides of Fried Okra and French Fries.  The Chicken was excellent as was the Fried Okra but the French Fries were raw in the middle.

Still on average, plentiful portions and except for the Fries, well prepared and tasty.

Big improvement and just off I-85 on the North side of Exit 33."}
{"text":"Can't never go wrong at a Cracker Barrel. Especially for breakfast.

Not a one in California so I have to stop at the first one I get to whenever I leave the state. Obviously this is not the first one out of California but it's the second day on my road trip and my second visit this weekend.

I like Cracker Barrel because of the big ole, manly breakfasts's (is that a word?)

I like to start off with a cup of coffee and I usually go for the same breakfast I always get: The Cracker Barrel Country Boy

This here is a MAN's breakfast : Your meat is a choice of country ham (super salty if you're not from the South), sirloin steak, or pork chops. Then, it is accompanied by three eggs, hash brown casserole, fried apples, grits, gravy, and plenty of buttermilk biscuits! 

Honey Hush!

This is the reason I only eat here 4 or 5 times a year. I've never encountered an establishment with a bad wait service so that's another reason why I love this chain. The wait staff never lets you see the bottom of your cup or glass. 

Like the menu says, sit back and loosen' your britches whenever you dine here. You'll leave miserable but you'll die happy!"}
{"text":"Came to Vegas and had to stop by for cracker barrel. I have been to several of these restaurants through out the country and I am so glad that as they make their way west (soon to be in Victorville ca) the quality has not changed. The wait for a table in a busy Saturday morning was 45 minutes,  I need a cup of coffee while I waited so I ordered one at the to go counter. I was helped by a gentleman named Lance,  he was happy to oblige my caffeine craving and when I tried to pay, he said it was on the house.  Our server was a gentleman named Uly,  again very nice and helpful. If management reads this,  I hope Lance and Uly get the credit they deserve. Thank you for once again providing good service and great good."}
{"text":"I missed cracker barrel so much! The pancakes are the best..it's soft on the inside and a bit crunchy on the outside. I tried their sweet potatoes for the first time and I think I will be getting them regularly from now on.

Their decor is super cute as if you were walking into a 80s farm house. You can grab sweets on your way out from their store for the road. Don't forget to take a couple of minutes to try their rocking chairs outside :D"}
{"text":"Other than always being busy and crowded, the good is good, service was great and the environment is welcoming. All the staff are very friendly and I love the store."}
{"text":"we came here for dinner and I really regret this decision. the food really sucked. I got the chicken and dumplings with macaroni and cheese and french fries. when it came out everything was cold and the macaroni and cheese was very dry sent it back. My GF ordered the country fried steak with macaroni and cheese and fries. Her food was hot but her country fried steak was very dry tough and full of nasty gristle. The service was very good but food needs major help. I/we will not be back.."}
{"text":"Stopped by on our way back into Las Vegas for breakfast. It was very busy. Love the little shop that is at this location. Have heard from several people that Cracker Barrel was soooooo good but I found it to just be an average Resturant. I can now say that I have been, and I think that I will only return if I have family visiting and they want to go. Prices were reasonable and food was descent."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the CB experience you get back East, pass on visiting this one. The wait is long, but I can't get mad about that. When you are seated, the obvious difference is they are trying to get you in and out as fast as possible. Servers are ok. Chances are your order will be wrong, so be ready for that. They can't hear over the loudness of the place. Servings aren't as generous as back East but prices are the same. Manager came to certain tables to ask how patrons were doing but didn't come to ours. All in all, I give it a C-."}
{"text":"Just bring a sweater because it's freezing inside . I went in from one extreme temperature to another and now I have a cold."}
{"text":"Went here around mid-day with the wife and kid. Got the cracker barrel country boy family favoritr. She got the fried chicken. Reasonable prices and reasonable quality.  I have had better at other locations around the country. Service was what is to be expected of a week old restaurant. But overall it was good cure being from the east coast."}
{"text":"If you went to one Cracker Barrel you've been to them all. I enjoy the pancakes the most. Always great, all the time. This was my first time getting dinner here, not bad. I don't recommend the Mac and cheese but it's not bad. Servers were cool and casual. I think Cracker Barrel has the monopoly on breakfast for sure but dinner is cool too !"}
{"text":"Well where do I start we went for breakfast and I ordered. Eggs in basket. Not realizing that my toast would have hole in it and. The scrabble eggs be in middle .not what I wanted. The sausage smelled. Funny. Looked funny so I asked the waiter abt it and what did he say well that's how are sausage is did u want turkey sausage UM NO.  I asked for toast with no holes so he says ok. I wait and wait remind u my eggs are getting colder and colder. He finally brings the toast. What a surprise NO  BUTTER, really! So he goes gets me butter  I eat my food drink coffee. 

Chris ham with his breakfast was the wrong ham.  Ugh so he brings the right Ham. But ends up being too salty . At the end the manager comes over asks how the food was and we or I  explained it all she says oh I'm sorry I'll be right back.  She doesn't come back but the waiter does with the bill and mine is off the bill.

Now will I eat there again probably. I always give places 3 tries. Plus I love the gift shop with the goat lotions. My favorite"}
{"text":"Worst cracker Barrel I have been to ever. I have a very bad habit of wiping off my silverware but this time it was a useful habit. The silverware was a filthy, as I was wiping there was dirt and grease coming off each piece and onto my napkin. When I tried to discuss it with the manager, he could've cared less. I would never eat in a place that has dirty silverware like this, who knows what their plates and glasses are like."}
{"text":"Placed an order for grandmas pancake breakfast and 2 mommas pancake breakfasts with my family. Rebecca was our waitress, and she was ok (at first). All of our pancakes came out extremely tough (tougher than a well prepared steak) . The kids had already started eating, so we asked that only our pancakes be remade. We were going to keep our eggs and sides, until my husband took a bite of his eggs and ate an egg shell. So she stated they would remake those as well. Our remake took another 20 minutes to come out, when it came back out, our pancakes were still tough, tasted as though they never remade the batter, just used the same over mixed batter. They actually remade the wrong breakfast because I never received the 3 pieces of meat, my eggs didn't have Colby cheese, and no hash brown casserole. The rest of my meal came back out about 5 minutes later, and the eggs were AWFUL! They looked as though they re-used the same eggs that were on the plate when they brought out our remake, dumped cheese on top, and put them in the microwave, there was no cheese cooked into the eggs, all of the cheese just on top. The eggs were not fluffy like my husbands either but very dense. The waitress came back out and I told her of my concern, and she immediately became defensive. If you are looking for less than mediocre breakfast, then by all means go here!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong eating here for breakfast. Everything is good and the people watching is entertaining. It's always loud but that's expected."}
{"text":"20 open tables, with a 5 minute wait that turned into 30 minute wait.  Food is good,  service is good but i dont get what the issue is today."}
{"text":"Normally I really like breakfast here. Not today. Server dropped off my coffee with no cream, took so long to bring it that the coffee was cold by then. Server brought my food, didn't ask if I needed anything when I wanted tobasco for my eggs and country fried steak and apple butter for my biscuit. When he did come back to check on me I told him what I wanted and he never brought it."}
{"text":"I used to live in the Deep South and miss the food.

Sadly, this Cracker Barrel is not the place to go for authentic Southern food.

I ordered the chicken fried steak breakfast with biscuits & gravy. The eggs were OK, the biscuits were subpar, and the steak itself wasn't bad--though it seemed more microwaved than fried. 

However, the country gravy was truly unfortunate. I like thick gravy. However, it is possible for gravy to be too thick. When I tried to dump the little bowl of gravy on my biscuits, the gravy didn't pour out; instead, a gelatinous slab of albinoid gravy slid out of the bowl and settled atop the biscuits, admirably retaining the cylindrical shape of the original vessel without so much as a wobble.

Even this could have been forgiven, if the gravy had not been utterly bland, without a hint of savory, sour, sweet, bitter, umami or any other scent or flavor detectable by human taste buds or olfaction. It was the gustatory equivalent of white noise. In terms of texture, imagine a mouthful of smooth yet flavorless phlegm.

The pecan pie was acceptable, but we made the mistake of ordering it a la mode, so it came with a little ball of freezer-burned ice cream that hinted at artificial vanilla flavoring.

The kitschy decor reflects nostalgia for the rural South of past decades, though without any representation of African American people or culture.

The place is soulless in every sense.

Country & western music plays constantly."}
{"text":"Absolutely 100% disappointing . I have been to other locations in the past and this one didn't impress us at all. Coffee is weak, tasted like tea. Over hard eggs were not even over easy, the yolk slid out almost raw! My scrambled eggs and hashbrowns were lukewarm at best. The gravy with the biscuits was lukewarm. The french toast lacked flavor. Completely unacceptable. We won't be back. They need to get this temperature issue taken care of for people's safety. The temp control back there is all off. And we weren't the only ones who have had these issues. I don't know why they are struggling so bad. I don't mind a 45-50 min wait for amazing food and service, this wasn't worth it at all."}
{"text":"The hype has finally died down a bit. Waited 20 min for dinner. The set up is nice. You wait while you look around in the store, they call your name overhead. Food was decent. Nothing special, but consistently decent throughout the meal. Lots of friendly staff, but our waitress was bad. No personality, I felt rushed to order. Very monotone like she was just not happy to be there. Although it seemed like she was nicer to her other tables. Don't know what we did to put her off. Only refilled our drinks once and that's because her manager said so. He seemed on top of it and he was friendly. Right after we finished our dessert, she looked right at our table and I'm pretty sure she noticed our drinks were empty and she just walked off. Then asked the table behind us if they needed refills. So I think that was the worst part. I did enjoy the peg game tho."}
{"text":"Our meal was terrible the pancakes were ok but the meat was greasy and not done.The sausage was standing in grease."}
{"text":"Delisious food! The country store is super cute too! Great service by Savanna! We stopped on our way home from Spring Training in Arizona, perfect location off the 10. We had French toast, it was big enough for two!"}

{"text":"It was a 15-minute wait to get an order taken for our drinks by another waitress not our waitress and then orders came out they were wrong the waitress was taking plates off of our table before we can even finish basically trying to grab the worst service I have saved for my Cracker Barrel yet recommend not to come to this one ever again"}
{"text":"First of all...
I don't even LIKE Cracker Barrel like that. 

But today I was hungry and after an unsuccessful morning of trying to get my savings on at the local GNC (another time and review smh) I HAD to eat. 

Paul was attentive, courteous, and accommodating. He kept my coffee hot and wasn't too clingy. He even had a sense of humor. 

 I ordered turkey sausage, scrambled eggs, and pancakes with hash brown casserole. My food was delicious and the perfect temperature. He didn't forget a single detail all the way down to my sugar free syrup. I'm not sure what's going on the the poor reviews but my experience was great from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Breakfast has always been decent at all the Cracker Barrels but dinner at this one was terrible. My meatloaf came out Luke warm. I sent it back and it came out slightly warmer. The vegetables were overcooked. My wife's pork chops had no taste. Overall it reminded me of cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Silly me. Forgot I had given only one star to this place.

Went back for dinner a couple of times and it was OK. Then I ordered peach cobbler to go. 

Here's the picture, not Photoshopped. This is actual size! 

It's about one third of the small cup! And they're getting $3.99 for this. Totally outrageous.

NEVER. GOING. BACK. 

NEVER!!!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is an old reliable - always good service and good food. Wait times can be long on holidays (as it was on New Years Day - but we knew that) - cannot complain that everyone wanted to eat at noon time, now can I?  On a follow up visit a few weeks later with another couple, we were seated within fifteen minutes. The hostess was pleasant, the waitress was pleansant and the food was like it always is - good and warm. No complaints here - bacon and eggs and toast and some kibble just to keep me happy (after all my wife tells me I'm a dog). This is a happy place where everyone comes to get theri happy on - one success after another. Here I just sit and enjoy - mommy says I'm a good boy!"}
{"text":"Great place for southern style cooking. Old Style store has nice holidays themed item for each different holiday. Lots of older candies and southern based food items also. Service is always fast, wait time are normally quicker than what they tell you. They can work in larger parties faster than most place. Be going to Cracker Barrel store nationwide since mid 80's so I really do go out of my way to visit them."}

{"text":"My wife and I love Cracker Barrels and have visited many on our trips around the States. There are none in California where we live so on hearing that two were opening in Las Vegas, about four hours drive from where we live we decided to drive up there this week. We stayed at a cheap Casino in order that we could eat  dinner at one and breakfast at the other.

The food was excellent! No complaints! However the shopping side at both were well below our expectations. One of the things that we like about Cracker Barrels is the excellent line of Christmas decorations on display even in the summer. We had recently been in New England and seen some pieces that we liked but were not able to bring back on the train. The Las Vegas stores didn't have any of these pieces and the associates had blank looks when we described them.

Perhaps in time they will fall in line with the rest of the country. We hope so. To repeat myself on one point however, they're worth a visit for the food."}
{"text":"Worst experience of my life. The staff was extraordinarily rude, and when i complained the waitress got an attitude and smarted off to me. The manager was an cocky arse. For my money U will go to First Watch. They have great food and outstanding service."}

I ordered a big ol' breakfast that came with eggs, grits, biscuits, gravy, sausage, bacon, hash brown casserole  and coffee.  I was with a large crowd and the wait really was not that bad.   My dish came out last and was lukewarm at best.  Everything was OK...'ish and I must have used half the salt and pepper on the table.    I really don't have anything too positive to say about it.  It was like after thought cafeteria meets soup kitchen.   I know they mean well but it's just not my soiree.

Staff was very nice.  Please was clean.   Service was good.  Interior decor was amusing to stare at.  Coffee was good and they gave me a cup-to-go.   All of this was worth an extra star."}

{"text":"Let me say that I've never been to a Cracker Barrel. There just aren't any where I live in California.

When I came to Phoenix for work, I made a list of all the places I wanted to eat. The place that made it onto the list included Culver's, Waffle House and Cracker Barrel.

I came on a Sunday and on Sundays they serve a home style chicken aka fried chicken. Having done some research, I knew that I needed to order the hash brown casserole. I also ordered the mashed potatoes, a side salad and peach tea. The chicken was definitely the highlight. I've never had a more tender fried chicken breast. The breading was also perfectly seasoned and crispy. I love my fried chicken, and this was pretty darn good fried chicken. The casserole was the biggest let down of my Sunday dinner. It was cold and bland. The peach tea was sweet, as expected, and the side salad was a side salad. I only ordered the side salad to get my daily vegetables in. The mashed potatoes were mashed and potato-y. It didn't blow me out of the water. I was also excited about the corn bread muffins and the biscuits. Bleh, they were barely edible. Both were extremely dry and flavorless, which was such a shame. 

Having come on a Sunday at 4:45pm, I didn't expect to need to wait 10+ minutes to be seated considering the restaurant was half empty and only 1 other party in line in front of me. My server was super friendly and nice. The food tasting bad wasn't her fault. Overall, I had a positive experience and am looking forward to the next time I have an opportunity to dine at a Cracker Barrel. I think I'll try the breakfast next time."}

{"text":"Another regular food place that people over-hype. The food was mediocre. Maybe because I expect my food to be seasoned or have an outstanding burst of flavor. Ordered a sirloin and decided to mix up my sides. Apples, Salad, and Pinto beans. Requested my sirloin to be cooked well. Turned out medium rare. Apples were brownish. Small bowl of pinto beans and salad was the best part of the meal for me.
Sister ordered eggs scrambled well done with the cheese on the side. Waitress brought a big plate with a small dried out piece of cheese in the middle. That was probably the only time I smiled (out of amusement) while I was here"}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful place on the planet. The food... the food is scrumtrulecsent!!!  The service... the service is beyond extraordinary, it's like walking into grandmas house every time I come here!!! I'm not shame see this family there twice today... Twice!!! Can you imagine having breakfast at grandmas and going snowboarding you coming home and having dinner at grandmas again? Well I think that's what it would be like and if I had more time I would've loved to of done it. If you're looking for a good home cooked style meal Cracker Barrel is the place to go."}
{"text":"The best customer service of any restaurant I can think of.  Calories on several menu items which I appreciate.  Food is exactly what you would expect, executed well and rarely any inaccuracies in the order.  Surprisingly good burger also."}
{"text":"What? They don't serve Kool Aid at Cracker Barrel?  You could have fooled me because people are drinking it by the barrel when it when it comes to this eatery.  I don't get it. I mean if overcooked salty ham and rubbery eggs are your thing...kool aid IS a necessity, I suppose.  You're definitely better off overindulging at any strip buffet or cafe, trust me.  

Six sentences later, I will get to my point.   This review isn't about the food.  I think everyone should try Cracker Barrel to judge the hype for yourself.   But biscuits and jelly go together like ... well, you know.  Except my biscuit didn't get buttered (literally or figuratively).  Our ham ran off with our missing jelly... and my face looked especially crummy thanks to my cold and the missing napkins. 

I could go on, but why bother.  You get the point.  
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  It sets the tone.  You know what kind of day I'm going to be having."}
{"text":"(6/18/16) I'm trying  a couple specials  today, the blackberry  iced  tea and the campfire  beef. Our server is Mac. Mac seems to be really frazzled, but I'm  not  sure  why. There are very few diners in his section. My glass is empty. Mac asks if I  want a refill. I say yes and give him a sceptical  look. Now when we were seated there was a party of four across  from  me  that got up as we were sitting down. The half hour that we were there I got  to  stare at a table  full of dirty dishes. No one made any attempt  to  bus the table.

The campfire beef was a couple pieces of pot roast that had been pressure  cooked or boiled. The meat was nice and tender. There were carrots, potatoes  and two half ears of corn. Everything  was  very tasty with the exception  of  the  corn muffins. They were dried out and had no flavor  at all. 

The blackberry  iced tea was refreshing  but also had no flavor. What a shame."}

Normally, this location and the several other I've been to, deliver a very satisfying meal and experience. They must have been off this past Tuesday.

When me and my girlfriend walked in, we waited a fairly long time for anyone to seat us. The front cashier noticed us waiting and I heard them page someone. Still we waited. I started to search the dining room for a server when someone came out and told us they didn't have a host that night. Okay, not a big deal. I'm fairly patient.

Our server was very nice. His name was Jesus and he did his job well. Things were going smoothly and then the food was delivered. My girlfriend enjoyed her usual meatloaf, which I also tasted, so I know her food was decently warm. However, my Fried Catfish and the sides were barely room temperature. It still tasted okay and I was hungry, so I didn't complain. I've never wished to have a table side microwave to zap my meal, but it would've been handy.

Like I said, I figure they must have been short handed in the front and back of the house. Otherwise, I will continue to patronize Cracker Barrel, because their comfort food is generally top notch. Especially their Fried Chicken special on Sundays. I'll update this review after the next visit."}
{"text":"Service extremely slow even though no wait. After ordering waited 37 minutes (per server), Cheryl Dee. She wasn't apologetic until after manager spoke with her..food was cold and when we spoke with manager he asked if we would like them to nuke (micorwave) it.. we will not return."}
{"text":"My first Cracker Barrel experience was in Arizona and the food there rocked. Maybe my expectations were higher. the flavor here was so different, the white gravy lacked the bacon flavor and chicken fried chicken was bland on the breading, I will not come back to this specific Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"PLEASE have patience and understand it is a new establishment so it will be a long wait and hectic. It's just another Cracker Barrel serving regular Little House on the Prairie type meals. The food is cool, I really like the general store products, esp the Goo Goos. They're great when I get the munchies #420"}
{"text":"For me, Cracker Barrel is a breakfast place. Never been there for any other meal. I know they serve three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner, just so you know too.

I really do like the breakfast selections which are wide and varied. The menu is a real challenge with so many choices and sides and combinations that they have created for you to select from.

You could also do a la carte if you like to pick and choose your own full complement breakfast.

I'm afraid I can't really speak to lunch and dinner, because I come from their great breakfast.

Blueberry pancakes, oh my god, you cant believe how good they are. Blueberrys out the door for Pete's sake. The most blueberrys I have ever seen in a pancake. Gee Wiz. So good.

Eggs every which way from Sunday. Sausage, Bacon, Biscuits, Sausage Gravy, holy cow.

Lots of sides, hashbrown casserole, \"Fried Apples\" did you every know such a thing, fruit plate, wonderful grits, and what they call 'sawmill' gravy and muffins to bring to light some of the choices.

If you don't leave happy, satiated and pretty full you did something wring, but they do have 'lighter' choices like fruit and yogurt and others on the breakfast, but not for me.

When you check out, at least I do, browse the front store offerings which are pretty 'country' kind of life style and  'lots of stuff'

Can't go wrong here, give it a shot."}
{"text":"5 servers bussing tables , not busy and after 15 mins of sitting with eye contact between our server yet we still sat and waited totsl time 20 minutes before being acknowledged."}
{"text":"So this is the second Cracker Barrel that I have tried, the first one being in Arizona and the second one here near Pittsburgh. Hmmm...Seriously the best part of the experience was the \"chotsky\" country store you have to walk through before and after you eat..., sort of like a minefield filled with every sort of old timey candy, Americana decoration, clothes, candles, flags....yada, yada, yada. 

Well,  maybe the food was wasn't the best but I bought some great souvenirs! Anyhow, we had a late breakfast (served all day) and our server was lame at best. She forgot to bring me my coffee and acted offended when I asked her to take it off our bill. 

My husband had asked for a ham and cheese dish without peppers and onions and was told by our \"lovely\" server that it was impossible to make it without peppers as it would take to long to pick them out of the mix. She offered him a ham and cheese omelet (not on the menu) and when it arrived our mouths just hung open with surprise. 
It was maybe a one or one and a half egg omelet, as flat as my ass (which is pretty damn flat) and had a slice of melted American cheese on too cut in half....Wow! And here I thought cafeteria food was lame! 

I had THE lamest sourdough french toast I have ever had, although the bacon was tasty but were two very, very tiny pieces. 

All in all, pretty lame and I ABSOLUTELY love it when the server comes over when you are done and gives you a great big smile and says \" Thanks for coming, have a great day\" and slaps the bill on the table. Oy!!! God save me from any more Cracker Barrels in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, family-friendly, fun shopping in the country store.  Lots of unique items. Lots of unique southern foods on the menu as well. I love the fried chicken steak! and it was the best I've ever had.  It was delicious, seasoned perfectly. Not much of a dessert menu but the meal portions are very filling and tasty. Service was friendly but a little on the slow side even though they weren't that busy."}
{"text":"pretty good comfort food.  service sucked but the food was good."}
{"text":"We always love going to Cracker Barrel on our way home from snowboarding and was so excited to have one so close to us in Vegas now. It took us months until we decided to come eat here because it is always busy. Finally decided to come here during a random time and luckily it wasn't so busy. My husband's favorite dish always is Saturday's chicken and rice. I love the dumplings and rainbow trout dishes but this time I tried the pecan crusted catfish this time and that was amazing! My go to side is always the delicious fried apples. They bring out biscuits and cornbread and by far the biscuits were my favorite! Glad to have this place close by to go to."}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix, I used to frequent CB quite often as the food was reasonably priced, breakfast or lunch was always good and service was stellar. I also liked the store in front of the restaurant and would often find things to buy from seasonal items to collectibles (long ago it was Boyd's Bears) and they had good candy.

Well, I have lived in the Bay Area for well over 8 years again and this was the first time I have been back to a Cracker Barrel. This time was for breakfast with my Mom and daughter. The service, as I remembered was fantastic, the menu huge but with things from reasonably sized to giant portions and all that in between. This was the first restaurant I can remember that asked me if I wanted my poached eggs soft, medium or hard (soft please) and the cheesy hashbrown casserole was still as good as I remembered. 

I will be back when I come back to town next and I can't wait!"}
{"text":"This place gave me the most mediocre meal I have ever eaten In my life. Room temperature food and poor service."}
{"text":"Service was good, but not a fan of the menu, and the food was blah. Eggs were undercooked and biscuits and gravy were flavorless. Sausage was oddly smoky and colorful, and hash browns were salty. Ambience was neat with fire going, but will not be back."}
{"text":"There are many dining options in Vegas and Cracker Barrel is really the bottom of the barrel. I ordered the oven fried chicken and it was overcooked  and dry. My friend ordered the chicken with dumplings and it was bland and served cold. The restaurant was crowded and noisy and the wait was over an hour for lunch on a Wed. Definitely not worth the wait. They really need to step up their game; we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel- Craig Road

I have always had a soft spot for Cracker Barrel especially for the Hash Brown Casserole- as it has spawned many homemade recipes at home to rival it. 

The GOOD: However, on my most recent visit, Mother's Day Sunday, we stopped in for a hankering for their infamous pancakes!! OMG mine were cooked to perfection!! A nice buttery crust on the outside and fluffy warm deliciousness on the inside. 

The BAD: My husband chose to order the Biscuits and Gravy with a side of grits- he didn't have the best luck and ultimately found a small black hair in his grits... I know what you're probably thinking.. Oh maybe it was his facial hair, brows or some other excuse... sorry folks- my Hubby is a Ginger Red Head :) As a result, our waitress removed it from the table, offered more grits( We declined)... but never took it off of our bill which was odd. 

My husband paid the tab and chose to keep it water under the bridge for the measly 2-3 dollars but... from a principle standpoint. I wish they went a little farther to make it right. 

The UGLY: Our party of 6 were served biscuits with butter and jam.. With. No. Plates... Needless to say we ate on NAPKINS!

Overall, the seating speed was decent since we reserved ahead, as well as our food was delivered hot and fast... so for that I scored a generous solid 3 stars.. We'll be back but won't be ordering the grits for a while and hoping for plates next time..."}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel all over the country and this is, by far, the worst. Horrible customer service from not very knowledgeable wait staff. The waitress wouldn't substitute my girlfriend's sliced tomatoes because \"they're a garnish, you're not supposed to eat it.\" Oh really? Then why is it a menu item? The manager simply refused to help or provide an explanation. CB is usually very good and I was very disappointed. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Were sat at the entrance and ignored for 10 minutes. Never acknowledged or offered a drink. Ended up leaving and unsure if they ever knew we were there. One star rating is pushing it, they didn't even seem to be that busy. Hopefully others had a better experience. Just reminds me why I do not eat here, what was I thinking?"}
{"text":"Our kids love the food at Cracker Barrel. When they're away from Phoenix they lament, rhapsodize, reflect on the heavenly food last served to them at Cracker Barrel. 

Darrin loves the catfish and greens. Orders it for breakfast, lunch or dinner every time he's in town. Chrissie enjoys the light, fluffy pancakes. 

Although Jr Jake prefers pancakes at Coco's he's smitten by the general store filled with candy, curios, and toys, toys, and more toys. He's amused by the checker board waiting for the next set of players to sit and play. And he's delighted by the peg board at each table waiting for him to invent his own fun.

We ate dinner, then breakfast the following morning at CB. 

- Exceptional customer service. 
- Enchanting general store decorated for Christmas. Uncommon, yet affordable tree ornaments and toys. 
- Mediocre food."}
{"text":"Food was delicious the server Stuart was extremely polite and helpful best server we have had in a while wait is a little long but you don't notice if your browsing around the country store and it's nice that they have the misting fans outside"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, and if you don't then you seriously have issues. Sunrise Sampler!!!"}
{"text":"This review got four stars because of our waitress since she was awesome. Her name was Angie if my memory serves me right. I couldn't give 5 stars because they were out of several items on the menu. We went there after long day at Carowinds. It was nice to eat some decent food after eating junk all day."}
{"text":"Not the best
Not the worst

I'd go back

I got the Sunrise Sampler breakfast meal

The biscuits were great!
The gravy was a little bland and old-people foodish
The eggs were buttery
I didn't care for the bacon, ham or sausage
Cheesey potatoes were great!
Grits... yucky.

So all in all... I'd go back, I just wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"Finally got into one of favorite restaurants yesterday, only to be a bit disappointed.  We waited an hour and a half before getting seated and the waitress came to our table asked what we wanted to drink and what we wanted....we had just been given the menus 30 seconds prior.  She came back with coffee that was just colored water, you could literally see the bottom of the cup.  She never came back except to give us the bill.  Some one else brought our food and then a different person to refill the colored water.  I heard 2 separate managers talking to the next table how since they opened, they have been failing at everything.  I agree, the food was just okay, not what I've experienced at other Cracker Barrels.  I will wait until the second Las Vegas opens the end of October to go back.....hopefully they will have it together as this location is clearly lacking."}
{"text":"As we entered I noticed the brass door handles were very clean or new.  The floor on the other hand was in need off a good mopping. I went to the restroom to wash my hands, it also needed a good mopping.  There seemed to be a path of grime from each of the two restrooms going past the hostess stand into the restaurant. 
 Our waitress greeted us promptly and took our drink orders and order.  Our food for some reason just seem to be a good as a normal visit.  The highlight came when I was cutting into my chicken (tuff chicken) when my knife slipped and broke my plate in half!  Our waitress said she never saw that happen before and notified the Manager.  He too was surprised and offered to replace my meal.  Over all the people were nice but the restaurant but everything else was below par.   I probably will avoid this Cracker Barrel until I see better reviews."}
{"text":"This location was OK. Like other Crocker Barrel, has the rocking chair in the front, you have to walk through the gift shop to get seated. Food was good, I really enjoyed the fried chicken. Didn't realize how good their chicken is. Was not that impressed with the biscuit and gravy. Service was OK, waitress was over whelmed. She needed help."}
{"text":"I can remember going to Cracker Barrel with my Grandmother about 30 yrs ago!! I don't remember the food, but I do remember the memories with grandma! Now all I hear is how great the breakfast is! Wife and I went to Cracker Barrel this past weekend. She has gone there a few times in the last year. For myself it's been a while. So I ordered their two pancake stack with a side of biscuit and gravy. Wife had two eggs and bacon. I was not to fond of their biscuit and gravy. Biscuit seemed to be on the dry side, and the gravy was like some kind of gel?? Not much taste. I did however really enjoyed their pancakes! Wife enjoyed their eggs and bacon, she likes her bacon extra crispy and it was perfect. It was a good time and we will probably come back."}
{"text":"Almost a fan, possibly could be a fan. Have to go there again to make that determination. 
Anyway, was there this morning with about 16 other car club members. We had let them know we would be coming and when as we all wanted to sit together as a group. When we got there it was as if no one knew anything. We had to wait awhile then we sat at separate tables for 4 each. The tables are movable, you can put several together to accommodate a larger crowd. So, there was no unity in the group for breakfast. Most of the food looked OK. Breakfasts are usually nothing special. The menu was huge but it was mostly sweet this and sweet that with more sweet on the side. Service was good, we all got our orders in pretty good time. To get to the restaurant you have to go through a store that is chock full of...well...junk. Looks like a tourist shop in any southwestern town. I guess it is suppose to be quaint, but when a place as so much stuff you cannot turn around without knocking something off a shelf..it is too crowded. So, I will give it another try, but not soon."}
{"text":"I've never been to a worse Cracker Barrel.
Let me start off by saying, the food was great, this review is solely based on the way we were treated by the staff and manager at this location.

Upon arriving, we had a large party so naturally we had to wait quite a bit longer than the normal wait time. We were waiting inside the store area because it was about 95 degrees outside, and no one wants to wait for an hour plus in that kind of weather. We had been waiting inside for a while already and one of the workers in the store made a comment that we could wait outside. We told him it was hot out there so that's why we were waiting inside (mind you, people from our party were actually purchasing things from the store). So, very smart ass, he says, \"oh you guys must not be from around here\". And starts to walk away, then under his breath, he says, \"you need to grow some hair on your balls\". WTF?!?

Yes, we are not from AZ, we are one state over...where we also have hot weather. But seriously, WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND would make a comment to CUSTOMERS saying something so rude and disgusting?!? This guy was asking for trouble. 

At this point, my husband is absolutely pissed and he is not the type of guy to get mad about much, he's the peacemaker that's always level headed. Well the guy comes back out and starts talking shit with one of the other workers that's behind the cash register, they start looking at us and laughing while making jokes about how hot it is outside. My husband approaches them and tells them they need to stop saying stuff about us. So the guy who originally made the comment, decides to go to the back room (I'm assuming he was scared he was gonna get his ass kicked).

I call for a manager because things are starting to escalate. The manager comes out (didn't get his name but he has gray hair and glasses) and I tell him what happened and what the employee said to us. He acts surprised and says he's going to go talk to him, so he also disappears to the back room. About 10 mins later, he comes out, does not say ONE WORD to anyone in our party, and acts like nothing happened at all. 

I obviously cannot believe that this just happened. To be treated so horrible by a company who prides their self in family, and then the manager doesn't even apologize or handle the situation at all....it's a joke. Anyway, we ended up eating there since we already waited so long, and our waitresses were actually pretty awesome. But it was just a really bad experience for us.

We are from California and we go to Cracker Barrel every year when we come here for my husbands hockey tournament. We definitely won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Delish!  Opened July '16!  Shey was awesome!  We came on a Saturday night and we're open past 10p!  And, the food was still fantastic!  Pancakes!  Fresh lemonade!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel. Especially their homemade syrup. It's the only syrup i use in the house.  I usually only order their french toast but today I ordered the roast beef dinner. It was good. The portions were really small.  I wish i got a bigger portion of meat with less fat but it was good nevertheless."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel. Good 'ol country cooking'.  But if it's not done right it can be awful. This location does it right. Cheery Hostess. Clean environment. Prompt service. Fast delivery.  Hot.  Fresh.  Tasty.  All good.  Try their fried chicken livers w/ mashed potatoes & white gravy.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The food was wonderful, the waitress was great. The management came around to check on everyone. I love this resturant."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for dinner, just two of us said it was going to be a 35 min wait, knew that already but wanted to try it.  Got seated rather quickly and started exploring the menu.  Both of us decided to get the Thursday night special Turkey n dressing, comes with two sides, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce.  But wait the dressing or \"cornbread stuffing\" counts as a side (wasn't that good btw) so I could only get one other side.  Chose fried apples because I overheard people saying that was what CB is known for (those were delicious btw).  When the meal comes, given we got the same thing and the other person got two sides, mashed potatoes and sweet potato casserole (very good as well), the two plates were so inconsistent and sloppy.  One was full and had 2 pieces of turkey, the other one just one piece of turkey.  Talked to the waitress and manager about the inconsistencies and the manager brought a new serving of turkey and says they do it by weight.  Not very impressed on the location at all, very small inside.  Won't be coming back because not worth it, the food or the wait."}
{"text":"We are avid CB customers especially when we travel it's a restaurant we always look forward to going to as a family. This new location is vey close to our home so we decided to wait until the crowds died down and they worked their kinks out. We checked in online which was convenient so when we arrived we waited less than 5 minutes to get our table. However the table was not cleaned off yet so we had to stand near the table and wait and since the dining area is extremely tight we were now in the way. Our waiter was quick to take our orders and our food came our in a decent amount of time. My son ordered the kids pancakes but there was no syrup I requested syrup for his pancakes and later was surprised to be charged for syrup! No where no even any other CB have we been charged for syrup for our pancakes. Ridiculous! When we went to go pay the cashier we had to wait in a line for almost 15 minutes. People in line were contemplating just leaving without paying, how would they know? If this is the cae why can't we just pay our waiter instead of waiting in a line that goes around the store? Then after we pay they tell us to enjoy some more shopping, um no hanks just to stand in line again. Probably won't be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"It is a damn shame we do not have this place in SoCal, because it would definitely beat the other diners. 
The only downside to this place is the wait-time. This particular location unlike the ones I've tried in AZ and FL had rocking chairs on its' patio for customers waiting to be seated - how cool is that !!!
Service was great just like the other locations I've been to.
Food: much much better than the average diner food. Just don't eat the dumplings! ;-) too doughy!"}
{"text":"Came on Friday and before leaving Vegas. Staff is always sweet  witty and fun food was fast and yum"}
{"text":"Gross man!  The food is tasteless slop and will only add about five cholesterol points to your day.  Not impressed with the granny bait store either.  The service is friendly, so at least the people who made you come here understand civility."}
{"text":"Avoid this place please! I came here for a work lunch, we signed up to have our name on the list around 11:30 to arrive at 1 and we were seated around two. This place was so crowded I was convinced the food must be the best ever. It was a Friday so I ordered the fish & chips. I have had fish & chips at many places in the US and abroad. What I was served was the most bland mediocre substance that they presented as fish. The fish had a rubbery texture and tasted like it was cooked from frozen then breaded and served. The \"fries\" were chunky and crispy. I looked at the other stuff my co-workers also got. The presentation is so sloppy. I have no idea why people are willing to wait hours to eat this bland mediocre food. The staff is friendly though. I bought some fudge in the gift shop and it had this off taste to it, the texture was also way too soft like the sugar got hot enough to reach the soft ball stage. Avoid, avoid, avoid- Silverton's coffee shop must be better..."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's a home town little place. Food is like what your mom makes. Chicken fried steak mashed potatoes and close slaw are the best.  The turkey dinner is to die for. The service is great. Servers are very attentive and friendly. I have to say everything I have had taste great.  Where I live there are none of these so I make sure to stop at one when ever I see them."}
{"text":"I grew up in the midwest, so I feel right at home here. The midwest motto: \"If it doesn't move throw GRAVY on it and veggies were MEANT to be cooked to mush.\" Oooops. Did I say that out loud?
I love the gift shops in these stores. I have eaten at this store a few times and they have many of the usual suspects from Southern and Midwest cuisine. I love the rocking chairs on the \"porch\" and the games on the tables. 
The quality of the food and services are just average as are the prices. This store is at the Riverview shopping district in Mesa Dobson and the 202. The parking is easy and plentiful."}
{"text":"very disappointed as I ate here on my birthday with my dad - who came into town for the weekend. One of my favorite restaurants of all-time, this location left a bad taste in my mouth.. literally. My dad was sick for 2 days and I couldn't eat anything for the rest of my birthday. 

We don't complain much, but called the store and the answer we got from management was: \"Well, no one else has complained about getting sick today so I don't know what to tell you..\" 

Rule #1 about customer service, most people won't tell you about the terrible experience - they just don't come back and tell everyone they know.. so, you're welcome.."}
{"text":"I certainly love it here. Love the food, love the atmosphere, love the store. I'm from California (state), and we don't have Cracker Barrels out there. The first time I ever ate at one, was this restaurant when I moved to Pgh for college in 2005. I'm hooked.

So although I live back in CA now, I had to bring my bf here last month when we were in town for a wedding. I loved my biscuit and gravy breakfast, but my bf was just expecting a little \"more\" from his meal. Maybe I talked the place up too much?? I dunno.

Anyway, this place will always get 4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always busy... for a good reason. The food was incredible down home cooking. I got the \"special of the day\" which was Fried Chicken w/ steamed Veggies and side salad with their black pepper vinaigrette (tasty). I highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Holy. Cow. I haven't been to a cracker barrel in years!!!! My boyfriend insisted we stop on our way out of Vegas. I wasn't sure what to expect since it had been so long. He had me try the breakfast menu, which apparently is available most if not all day? I ordered blueberry pancakes and biscuits and gravy with sausage. He got a breakfast sampler. The sausage was smokey but dry, and I wish I skipped it. The biscuits were perfection. The gravy needed a little more flavor but was still decent. What really knocked it out of the park is those blueberry pancakes.....buttery, blueberry, pancake goodness served with the best blueberry syrup and maple syrup!!! I also had a bite of his fried apples and hashbrown casserole, which are both fantastic! Our waitress today was incredibly friendly and kind, which put things on an extra positive level for us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for breakfast. Cracker Barrel WAS my go to place for breakfast. After this visit, I won't go back. We put our name in and we were called within the time quotes to us for wait. The hostess seemed inexperienced but everyone has to learn at some point, she seemed lost as to what table she was to seat us at. She finally found a table and it was right next to a table that had left and there was throw up all over the floor. Waiter greets us with in a few minutes and I can even look at the menu because of the throw up. Ok. Throw up got cleaned up. Now I can look. I ordered eggs and grits with toast. The butter dish, after I had used the butter and noticed, has a cherry stem in the bottom. EWE! DONT YOU CLEAN YOUR BUTTER DISHES!!! Now I'm ready to throw up. Had to get out of there. Apparently this is a very filthy place since they don't change their butter dishes. If they don't change those, what other corners are they cutting when it comes to the public health. Food was good but still feel like I'm going to barf."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was quite displeased. The food presentation was sloppy, the service also was very slow. We had two waitresses come over and ask us for drinks, obvious miscommunication going on. Also, very older crowd here. Prices were also a bit high for this type of dining experience. No booths in the restaurant, all uncomfortable wood chairs. The decor was the best part of the restaurant, felt like I was eating in Oklahoma. The store itself was fine, but the restaurant is a disaster."}
{"text":"Food is alway hot, fresh delicious. Cornbread and biscuits are good. I love there green beans. People are always friendly. If you need some chicken noodle soap it's just perfect."}
{"text":"Used to like coming to Cracker Barrel service is good the food was good but now that i  came back it's been about 6 months there's definitely been some changes in the recipes or how the chefs cook the food because it's not as tasty as it used to be service very friendly but very forgetful . but was compensated for it.  Management does need more attention to there tables"}
{"text":"Wow....well....besides the food looking mediocre and the beautiful antiques that are on display the cracker barrel in Arlington TX off Bowen Rd/ I20 is a joke, but not a very funny one. #1- IF any patron were to peek into the kitchen area, you wouldn't make it to the bathroom quick enough and would inevitably vomit on the already dirty floor. I guarantee you some of the food splatter on the walls etc. Are 6 mos old. Besides that..they treat any employees that haven't been there 10 yrs like crap. I was promised 35 (plus) hrs per week with average nightly tips of 100-200. YEA RITE!!!!  I'm scheduled the nxt week for 9.5 hrs!!!! And the most I EVER made was 63 bucks in a day!! How can anyone live on that?????  And what's really funny is there \"NOW HIRING\" sign still up!! Grow up cracker barrel!! Give ppl a chance to actually make money!!"}
{"text":"The store itself was nice. The staff was welcoming and helpful. After I made my store purchase my mother and I decided to have dinner. 

Sitting here now, and honestly, worst service we have ever had. Our server, Keoshi, didn't really greet us...here's how it went:

K: Hiiiiiiiii
Mom: hello
.......... are you new?
K: no?
Mom: are you just shy?
K: no, I'm just overwhelmed.
Mom: ok, would you like us to leave? (Jokingly)
K: yes
Mom: what? I'm sorry???
K: yes
Mom: you want us to leave? 
K: oh...umm...what would you like to order? 



Time goes by, we get our food and she just starts to leave as my mom has to ask for more water. 

She comes back and doesn't even know how to pour from the side, water and ice go into my mothers food. She does nothing and comes back with another jug to fill my glass. 

Time goes by and we never see her. So how was she overwhelmed with a room where 6 out of 22 tables actually have customers. Mind you, he only other table has left at this point. 

She comes by: 
K: do you want the check now?
Mom: no, I'd like more water, please. 

Fills, no words exchanged. 

Time goes by again...
K: do you want your check now? 
Mom: no, not yet, unless you think so (gestures to me)
Me: no, I'm still eating my food. 


Needless to say, we weren't welcomed in the first place, nor were we allowed to enjoy our meal. She never asked how was the food, didn't engage at all, not that we could hardly hear her. She doesn't speak loud or with enthusiasm. Clearly does not enjoy her job."}
{"text":"Came to vegas for the buffets and guess what I found yep one my most favorite restaurants in the world I have gone to one in every state I have driven thru and to my surprise vegas has two of them . Soooo excited! The food here is just as delicious as the one in Arizona. Before I leave vegas I will have breakfast here. This place is just another reason to come to vegas . The service was wonderful from Frank our server he was on point with the food and drinks didn't even have to ask for anything he checked up on us making sure everything was up to par which it was. Every one here is friendly courteous and happy to be part of Cracker Barrel. Thank you for such wonderful service and food. I recommend everyone to come by and try it out"}
{"text":"Talk about a cool place. Outside the place are a bunch of rocking chairs line the front. As you go through the front doors, there is a gift shop with lots of toys and candies and items that will bring a blast from the past to you and keep your kids delighted for hours. 

The seating is all nice, the server was great and the food was amazing.  The kids loved playing the peg game that is on every table. Portions were way too big but they were amazing. Comfort food to the max."}
{"text":"My first time at a Cracker Barrel was good and it is a reasonably priced family style restaurant with very delicious Pecan Maple fried chicken. Service is friendly and you will be full for $10 and under!"}
{"text":"Poorly run restaurant with great food.

We don't have Cracker Barrel in California, and for that reason, every time I come out to Arizona I have to come to Cracker Barrel! I love their southern comfort food and the superb hospitality. 

Unfortunately, this location seemed to be poorly run and workers all looked and sounded like they hated their lives.

We waited about 10 minutes to meet our server (in an empty restaurant) and then she admitted to not realizing we were there. Our food came out promptly and was as good as I remembered. The server then dropped the check as soon as our food came. 
Our water was never refilled, I couldn't order anything else, I couldn't even find a sever to help with a to-go box. Right when our food and check was dropped off, their job was done. 
I heard multiple employees yelling at each other about lunches and clocking out like I wasn't right in front of them trying to pay my bill. 

It was a weird experience since every time I go it's the complete opposite. I'm guessing it's just this location. 

My suggestion, go down the road to another Cracker Barrel. Still love the food!"}
{"text":"Stopped at the new cracker barrel on our way to St. George, Utah. It isn't sunday, so I couldn't get the home style fried chicken that I had the first time I tried a CB. I did order a Rueben Grill and that was delicious. I ordered fries with it, and they turned out to be steak fries which I'm not a fan of, so I wouldn't order those again. My only other advice if you order the Rueben is don't share it. Eat the whole thing. It's really good. The corned beef is lean and fresh and there is a perfect amount of Swiss Cheese and sauerkraut. You will feel a slight moment of regret as you watch someone eat the other half of what could have also been cozy in YOUR belly. 

About the staff... We met a homeless gentlemen outside who was hungry. We offered to have him order something and have it out on our bill. He asked the hostess if he could come in and eat it instead of sitting in the cold 43 degrees. They welcomed him in and treated him like the human he is. This would deserve all the praise I can muster, even if that Rueben wouldn't have been as good as it was."}
{"text":"Went here one night a little late and it was good food as to be expected. our server Michael G was outstanding."}
{"text":"I was super excited to see the Cracker Barrel and insisted we visit for breakfast.  After a 35 minute wait, we were seated and ordered our meals.  The grits were lumpy, the waitress forgot my hash brown casserole and the other items were just ok.  My son wasn't so impressed with the pancakes and didn't like the sausage which is a food he loves.  We asked to substitute the eggs for sausage and the waitress said sure but when we received the bill she charged us for a side of sausage.  If you are going to charge us and not substitute, just let us know.  I was disappointed with the meal and it just wasn't as good as the Cracker Barrel I visited in Tennessee."}
{"text":"I went in solo - there was a huge crowd but, the atmosphere was very pleasant so I didn't mind waiting and looking around their little shop. My waitress was pleasant enough and the food was delicious - I had the catfish and hash brown side dish (wish I would've picked a different side but, it was decent enough), and some mixed veggies that were delicious. I left with a smile and I felt I got what I paid for - good food and good service."}
{"text":"The service was AMAZING! She was sweet as can be. I got Mama's Pancakes and Ray got Mama's French Toast. Came with Eggs, Bacon and cute little warm bottles of maple syrup. You should definitely go here! Bonus is the RV parking spaces behind the restaurant. Fit our giant moving truck without a problem."}
{"text":"Great choice for a good home cooked meal. Service is usually good and you can't beat breakfast all day! They have healthier options too, if you're looking for a lighter meal. I love their mac n cheese and hash brown casserole. Great breakfast choices too! I also love looking around the store. They have such cute things from clothes to decorations for every season. Don't forget about all the old school candy too!"}
{"text":"We come to Cracker Barrel on pretty regular basis, and in November and December we come every Sunday because it's the only time of year that they have the cinnamon swirl French toast. We wait an hour today and get seated,, and find out they RAN OUT OF CINNAMON SWIRL FRENCH TOAST.
What a bummer ,, it's the last weekend we will make it before the promotion is gone till next year.
Shame on you Cracker Barrel...."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time calling in an order if you are in a hurry. I called in an order at 6:09 and was told to pick up my order in 20 minutes. I show up 20 minutes later to pay for my order and it hasn't even been sent to the kitchen yet, so I stand around and wait for another five minutes to pay. Obviously showing that I am disgruntled I get offered a free beverage or slice of pie while I wait. I take the slice of pie, and I am told my order will be right up. Nope, 25 minutes later and my order is finally done. I might as well have just ate inside the restaurant with my family. Cracker Barrel has lost a customer who visited on a weekly basis.

And then I get home and the order is wrong. I should have known better"}
{"text":"My waitress Stacey at Cracker Barrel Brooklyn, was excellent... But the food was adequate at best
Bacon came out under cooked and when I sent it back....it was returned like shoe leather.  It may have been placed in some kind of microwave device but it clearly did not go back on the grill. 
Maybe I will take a long break from this restaurant until things in the kitchen are managed a bit better"}
{"text":"Bad customer service!   Paid more money on a menu item just because I wanted to exclude something so they rang it up ala carte and I had to pay more. 
I brought it to the managers attention and she could have made an adjustment but arrogantly chose not to and had a bad attitude.  I'm not coming back.
It'll be  IHOP from here on out for me. 
IHOP values their customers. It's sad when your patronage is not valued enough to make adjustments where necessary.  Cracker Barrel is not worth the long wait."}
{"text":"I don't remember the food quality being this bad from my Cracker Barrel memories  20 years ago .  I've had thicker bacon than the hickory smoked ham.. the tea is awful, no ice????? Warm drinks and the bread.. ugh.  I couldn't buy anything from the gift shop it was that uninspiring and underwhelming.  I felt like my stomach had just been run over by a Sysco food truck.  I'm sorely disappointed and hope this review is read by someone who cares to take a stand and take a stab at creating a happy guest experience.  There's better food at a Waffle House. 

My dollars and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to check this place out since friends were raving about it. Even with that, I didn't set any expectations since I really have nowhere to compare it to. Got inside and I like the interior, the store was a little congested, but I like the set up. There was no wait time, but I was still able to check in online, total time saver should there be a wait. Lucky for us, we were seated right away. The dining area was very inviting. They had a fireplace on, checker boards, nice country feel. Here's where it gets a little ummmm... can't really put my finger on the word coz it's not really horrible, but it was enough to make me reconsider coming back here. 

We were following the hostess to the back of the restaurant and here I'm thinking, window seat? Ummm no we went back around and were seated right smack in the middle. It felt like we were playing musical chairs coz we literally went around a bunch of empty table. I asked if I can sit by the wall since we had my toddler with us. I was told, \"umm well I have to ask\". Mind you there was at least 5-8 empty tables by the wall. Ok no biggie, we'll manage. We sat down and waited, and waited, and waited while there were servers everywhere! After maybe 15-20 minutes a server asked us if we've been help I said no, not even a drink order. He took our drink orders, he was polite and pleasant. Cool then another server comes up and ask us for our drink order again? Ok miscommunication, maybe. Then once we got our food another server comes and said she'll be taking over. Ok no prob, happens in other restaurants. It would've been ok, but they were so slow to respond, forgot to refill our coffee, gave us our ticket way too early and didn't really check on us after she left the ticket on the table. They weren't even busy and there were a gang load of servers on the floor! Maybe because this place is still new that they are still trying to get organized, but I felt neglected. The food was really good, but it came right out when I got home. Not a good experience and am not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want from a Cracker Barrel. Hot, fresh food. Quick and friendly service. A very nice addition for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great general store, food was good and they wait was short 5-10 minutes on a Saturday morning. The food presentation wasn't great but the food was good. Bacon, eggs, grits and biscuits with apple butter. The apple butter and bacon were really good. They have fast and friendly service so I would go back. They have rocking chaira outside incase you have to wait. The prices are affordable and its great for families."}
{"text":"Giving 5 stars to this location primarily because of how gracious their staff was today in spite of the CRAZY crowd (I had no idea so many people ate out for Thanksgiving?!) and the fact that they were having to work on a holiday. They had a limited menu, so we all ordered their Thanksgiving plate-turkey, ham, dressing with gravy, cranberry relish, sweet potato casserole, a vegetable side of your choice, biscuits or cornbread, and a slice of pumpkin pie. No substitutions, not even replacing ham with extra turkey. The food was honestly just as good as any homemade holiday meal I've ever had. CB always does home style well. 
We did the call ahead and were on the wait list for an hour. They really were flipping tables quickly, all things considered. Of course, I still  heard several ungrateful guests being ridiculously rude to wait staff and management because some people are just the worst. 
We will definitely return to this location, either on a holiday or otherwise."}
{"text":"We had heard really good things and were so excited to try this. Unfortunately it was a very very bad experience. 

From the staff ignoring us when we walked in, to being sat at a dirty table, it didn't start well.

We waited a very long time to have our server approach. We ordered both drink and our food all at once. We had to explain to our server which side dishes were actually available according to the menu. 

Well when the food arrived is was all bad. My steak was well done instead of m-rare, but I didn't discover this until it sat in front of me for 10 minutes as they didn't give me a steak knife. My wife's chicken and dumplings were cold, my daughter only received half of her food, and the half she got was old and dry. 

We mentioned all this to the manger. She assured us she would fix it all. She didn't do anything for us. In the end they didn't discount or comp any items for this terrible experience."}
{"text":"There are no Cracker Barrels in CA, so this chain of restaurants has remained an elusive mystery to me for years and years. When I happened to see one while driving on highway 15 in Vegas, I decided to stop to eat there. It has an old-timey southern general store look to it. There's like a porch in the front with lots of rocking chairs that people can sit on while waiting for their table (the chairs are also for sale). There is a store part and a restaurant part. The store part is where you enter through to find the hostess and it also sells lots of random stuff. Stuff I guess your general store would've sold like moon pie and cornbread mix. They sell Cracker Barrel branded products and also things like home decor, clothes, children's toys, lotions, etc. This is also where you would order takeaway. They have a breakfast menu and a lunch/dinner menu, but they serve breakfast all day. The dinner menu showed the most popular items, like the chicken n dumplings and the chicken tenderloins. The food is pretty much American/Southern food. I saw that they had a kids menu with smaller portions of their popular items and the description said it was for kids of all ages with no age limit. So I asked and they confirmed that anyone could order from the kids menu! 

I ordered the chicken n dumplings and a side of the fried okra and a raspberry iced tea. The girl who took my order was really nice and gave me some recommendations when I told her it as my first time here. I had to wait soooo long for my food though. Like 30 minutes which was annoying. Takeout is supposed to be quicker. When they finally brought out my food, they apologized and said they were waiting for my biscuits to finish cooking. 

The chicken n dumplings were good. I liked the dumplings part with the sauce more than the chicken, which was dry. The fried okra was good too. The biscuit was good but not amazing. And they didn't give me butter to go with my biscuit, so that was disappointing. The raspberry iced tea was refreshing and the right amount of sweetness. 

Overall, I'm glad I finally got to try this place since I'd always been curious about it. I can cross it off my list but I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed. This was my second time there. Dinner is way better then breakfast. Everything was undercooked. Service was slow. Not sure why people go crazy for this place. I do love the decor and the cute store. Stick with dinner it's the way to go!"}
{"text":"Two more tries, only more of the same. Long waits to be served cold eggs, cold toast, dry and cold ham. Tried telling the manager about this problem but I gave up on waiting for him, I paid and left. It's pretty strange that I haven't yet found a good place in Charlotte to have ham and eggs"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating at Cracker Barrel, but not so much today. They were very busy and it was reflected in the quality of food/ While the server did a great job and I didn't have to wait long, the food was not well presented (aka, thrown on the plate)."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and the service was rushed, our server brought a to go box and the receipt 15 mins after we got our food. I had the Mom Pancake Breakfast with a side biscuits and gravy with grits, avoid the grits and gravy. It's worth paying a visit if you just want to shop at the store."}
{"text":"We're going to miss this popular hangout when we leave the area. We got to know the friendly staff over the years and enjoy their consistently prepared food!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast and after our food arrived the server never once returned. We didn't have ketchup or any other condiments. I sat there until my eggs were stone cold then finally got up and had to request the bill from the cashier. The manager had to come to the register and he didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. We definitely won't be back. Horrible service!"}
{"text":"Oh my god, I'm in love with my NEW breakfast favorite at Cracker Barrel, \"Uncle Hershel's Favorite\". 
A wicked diverse, yet delightful platter, filled, for me with Two eggs, scrambled with cheese, Grits, Sawmill Gravy, homemade Buttermilk Biscuits, real butter and  Preserves, Hashbrown Casserole Farm-Raised Catfish Fillet. 

A feast truly fit for one of Royal lineage.
The coffee could have been a bit hotter, but it was none the less good. 
We were attended to by a most delightful waitress who's service was second to none. Someone call me a wheelbarrow to roll me out of here."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at a Cracker Barrel.  I won't go back.  First off, you can't navigate through the \"store\" because there is so much crap and then people don't want to be considerate of others trying to get by.  Our server was wonderful, truly.  All the staff seemed great, but the food is so awful.  The menu boasts \"thick sliced bacon\".  The bacon is not thick sliced, I've had better from Wendy's on a cheeseburger.  The apple cinnamon oatmeal had two small slices of apple and I couldn't taste cinnamon at all.  The oatmeal was gummy.  Also, check your water filters because I kept having to add sugar and lemon to my hot tea to get the disgusting taste of metal or whatever to take a backseat to the actual flavor of tea.  No one else in my party said anything about their food, but they didn't seem too impressed.  I paid $50 for this meal (before tip).  Seriously?  I'll take my breakfast business to one of the local owned establishments and pay that price for food that is actually fresh and doesn't look like it came from a McDonald's."}
{"text":"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

 I enjoy eating out in different restaurants on a regular basis. After a long day of shopping I decided to stop at the Cracker Barrel, Hadn't been to Cracker Barrel in a long time but every time I drive past it's always packed so I thought the Cracker Barrel would be good food choice. WOW was I wrong!! 

The service was slow, and the food was tasteless and cold.  It was the worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Even though we ate very little off our plates it wasn't until - the cashier asked me \"how was the food\"; that anyone even showed concern. I told the cashier it was \"terrible it just wasn't good\".  I wasn't going to speak to a manager initially however; the two cashiers talked me into speaking with a manger. After waiting 20 minutes for a manager, I walked away with one thought on my mind. I will never go back again."}
{"text":"Everything was just as awesome as I remember! Yes, there is still quite a long wait for a table, but they've only been opened a month or so. Considering the fact that the dining room was packed, the wait for our food was not that long. Everything was delicious, and absolutely every staff member we encountered was awesome, especially our server Dominique! Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place.

Always brings back the Midwest nostalgia.  I like perusing the little country store before my meal... there are the strangest little knick-knacks there that you feel you can't live without.  A tea kettle shaped like a rooster??  Sign me up.!  

I think this is the only place still doing low-carb... listing all of the net carbs on the menu.  Thanks, Cracker Barrel.  It's pretty inexpensive for the amount of food you get.  The quality of the food?  Mehh...

Our waitress was a little older... bless her heart.  She was keeping up for the most part.  All in all, just okay... I might be back to check out breakfast... it looks really tasty."}
{"text":"I can see the wait is long. The food is well worth it but the hostess staff is nasty. There is one guy that is African American named Dylan and he's cool, but the 2 inside are complete rejects Savannah & Hayliegh...please."}
{"text":"So me and my fiancé just decided to go here for dinner. When we walked in a random lady gave us a stare as if we had poop  on our faces. Not only, this was some of the worst services I ever have had. We were seated for 10 plus minutes without anyone greeting us. I started to count how many waitresses walked by us, 8. We waited another 5 minutes, still no service at all. We politely got up, spoke to a manager, and left. 15 minutes when you're hungry/hangry is an eternity. Not sure if it was due to us being a gay couple or a black couple because there were not busy by far. As well as there were many servers on the floor. So, your staffed, it's not busy, I see many others getting greeted, food/drinks delivered while we sat hangry and parched. Anyway it goes piss poor service."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this place is the service. The food, to put it politely, sucks. If you like scrambled eggs dry and cold this place is for you. If you like dry and bland sausage patties this place is for you. If you like watery grits, this place is for you. The line to get in was close to an hour. I would not have cared if the menu description matched what was served. I felt sorry for the wait staff as clearly it was extremely busy. The manager on duty seemed nice enough, but there was another older gentleman with balding white hair who seemed to treat the other employees like they were slaves. I felt sorry for them. I chose not to complain as the slave driver undoubtedly would have taken it out on the overwhelmed wait staff. Bottom line, tourist joint, phony, fake \"country style food\""}
{"text":"The service was very quick and efficient.  The waitress was prompt and attentive to our needs. We were in and out within an hour. The only problem was there were not enough cashier to check customers out during lunch hours. Before we left more cashiers were called to assist.  Good experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is getting low stars! Service was great! Our server Kathi took great care of us. Was on top of our coffee and soda refill, very friendly! Food was just like I remember, the pancakes with real maple syrup, crispy edges, the way pancakes should taste. Country fried steak tasty, love the gravy! Hash brown casserole to die for!
Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"It always smells like an armpit in there. The aroma of bad body odor isn't appetizing while trying to eat."}
{"text":"The food was a 100! thats really all i have to say. the atmosphere is nice, lots of people, little noisy but thats okay.

with service though, Jesse took a while to get to our table and I had to wait like 10 minutes to order.... and then later on, someone else brings our food. We later had to wait another 5 minutes to ask for ketchup and when he brought it he also brought tobasco sauce which was nice. 

besides that i felt like our server didnt deserve a tip because he was never at our table (: but tipped anyways."}
{"text":"How could you not love cracker barrel? I admit, it's not the most amazing food I've ever had but you know what? It's always. Always consistent. The experience as a whole is always positive and I always know I'll be leaving there pleased, even if I had to wait 40 minutes to get in. I'd rather go somewhere and know exactly what I'm getting than show up and hope for a good day...

Oh and all you haters can whine about WiFi and Tv's and crap but guess what... that's not the restaurants concept. The point is not to have them. How about sitting down and enjoying the company of the people around you, cruising the shop and playing the peg game I have never been able to master!"}
{"text":"After religiously eating here 5 times a week (sometimes multiple times in one day) since their grand opening, I've finally got around to writing a review for my go-to spot in Vegas. 

The food is amazing. I don't think there's anything on the menu that I haven't tried -- and there's not a single thing I hate. The portions are satisfying; you will definitely need to loosen up your belt after leaving. 

My usual meal: meatloaf dinner with mashed potatoes, mac 'n cheese, & sweet carrots. Don't tell my mom, but I prefer Cracker Barrel's meatloaf over hers. 

My favorite part about Cracker Barrel is the customer service. Whoever did the hiring has done an exemplary job. 

Everyone does an amazing job but my friends and I get excited when Lynette serves our table. She has a contagious smile and always remembers our names/orders -- which makes us feel at home. And whenever we bring someone new to the Cracker Barrel experience, she always takes the time to explain the menu and offer suggestions."}
{"text":"I went there on Thanksgiving with a singles group. Nice atmosphere and an excellent server, but the meal was nasty. I wasn't even going to touch the yams! Apple pie was crusty and hard..no desire to finish it. We really enjoyed the rocking chairs though!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is just OK for a traditional, comfort food breakfast. If you're looking for novel breakfasts this place isn't for you. Biscuits and bacon are the mainstay. If you want a tummy warming breakfast, the is the place. :) 

Today I had eggs in basket with bacon. This was one of the smaller size breakfasts and I was glad I went that way because even this was enough food for me. The bread was sour dough with a perfectly perched egg on top. The egg was cooked to order. The bread was dripping in butter. (Yum! But back to healthy eating tomorrow!)  It came with three slices of bacon and a small portion of their hash brown casserole. Hash browns are good, and I think cooked with cheese. Definitely a caloric splurge (once again). 

One of my favorite things about breakfast is the coffee. I was disappointed. It was okay coffee if you drink coffee of the Folger's variety at home, but I like it dark and bold. My palate is trained that way after years of drinking amazing cups of Joe. I couldn't even finish the first cup. Next time, water only. 

Service was good --- barely any waiting and they were efficient and friendly

And now, the store with the goodies (aka gift shop) I am always compelled to look around because one year I found the cutest pumpkin salt and pepper shakers here for fall.  I scored again today since I found some really cute resin angels for upcoming birthdays AND they were on sale. 

All in all, this is a ok place for breakfast and for a bit of spontaneity, curio shopping. Friendly staff with comfort food is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Breakfast for lunch? Why not! Momma's Pancake Breakfast consists of three buttermilk pancakes served with 100% pure natural syrup n' butter plus two eggs and thick-sliced bacon or sausage (pictured: sunny-side eggs and thick-sliced bacon). I have never had pancakes like this in my life - crispy, buttery outer layer enveloping a warm, fluffy interior. And did I mention that the pancakes are HUGE! The syrup comes in these cute little glass bottles, too. The thick-sliced bacon has a smoky, savory pork flavor that perfectly compliments the pancakes. I can't wait to order this again! Rating: 5/5

Cast Iron Pressed Maple Jam N' Bacon Burger starts with two patties topped with maple pepper bacon, Colby cheese, maple onion jam, and finished with lettuce and tomatoes. If this seems like too much meat for you, you can opt for a single burger patty, too. The hubby had a huge appetite after driving for so long. The burger patties are juicy with a great balance of salty, sweet, and smoky flavor. I love that Cracker Barrel uses Colby cheese. You don't see it very often and it has a wonderful gooey, creamy texture. Cole slaw is my hubby's favorite side at Cracker Barrel. It is flavorful with just enough dressing on it so it's not dry. Fries are crispy but fluffy inside. Rating: 4.5/5

All-American Apple Pie is served with no sugar added and topped with premium vanilla ice cream. This has to be one of the best apple pies I have ever had. It is all about the crust! The crust tastes homemade like my Dad's. The apples are just sweet and tart enough and work well with the sweet, creamy vanilla ice cream. Rating: 5/5

Chocolate Pecan Pie (seasonal) is topped with premium vanilla ice cream. We don't see pecan pie in SoCal very often but the name \"Chocolate Pecan\" piqued my interest. This is also the second time I've ever had pecan pie. It is delectable, but the combination of pecans and chocolate reminded me of a good chocolate granola bar. It's a yummy choice, but my favorite is still the All-American Apple Pie. Rating: 4/5"}
{"text":"I am not endorsing the entire chain with this review, but rather this store in particular.  Yelpers, this may be the best Cracker Barrel in Christendom.  

I know, a lot of Yelpers out there are too hip for a chain as frumpy and junk filled as the CB - but I gotta tell you get past the giftshop and the TJ Mcgillicuddy like wall flare and there is something to latch onto here... the food is actually very good... assuming you stick to my golden rule of \"The Barrel\":  Stick to \"country food\" - that is, don't mess around with salads, baked fish, and the like.  The more country it sounds, the higher your chances of success. 

Highlights: 
Hashbrown Casserole
Turnip Greens 
Breakfast
Country fried chicken (Sunday's only)"}
{"text":"Been coming here since this location has opened, almost? always friendly and always busy. Food is brought to the table in a fairly timely manner. While you wait you play checkers or a puzzle game. I'm the cold weather they have the fireplace? rearing its heat for the customers warmth. They also have a country store with old school gadgets."}
{"text":"Both locations are exceptional, service, food and the stores are all very well decorated. The menu is filled with choices beyond your country cooking imagination."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for breakfast the morning after a crazy night. 

Service here was good but place was very crowded and food took a little longer than I wanted to wait for."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I've been here many times & pretty much eat the same thing. Eggs & bacon. I asked our server for CRISP BACON & OVER EASY EGGS. What I received is another story. Under cooked bacon so the cook cooked the bacon longer but when I got my plate my eggs were cold. Also one egg was cooked medium to well. Unfortunately the texture of the bacon is like Beef Jerky. A manager came by asked us how things were. My partner said good but I said NOT Good. So he asks me if they fixed the bacon I said yes but I got cold eggs. So I didn't win in this situation. Don't know if the server screwed up or the cook screwed up. Will have to rethink coming here again. What did make me happy was shopping in the gift shop. Bought a parrot statue & a top. I've bought a lot of things here plus their online store."}
{"text":"Not a very memorable experience, after the 1 hour wait, that might have been tolerable if the food was decent, it was a disappointment.  The weak watered down coffee wasn't a very good start, so it through the whole breakfast ordeal off the rail.  On a positive note, the fruit yogurt with an abundance of blueberries & some strawberries picked up the second star for this local."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots I've been a few times no complaints my food was good and so was the customer service I received each time I've been will definitely return"}
{"text":"Excellent seasoned food with reasonable prices with served with southern hospitality."}
{"text":"My husband, son, and I ate there on 5/18 around 8:40 PM. It took 15 minutes just to have our server, Amber, take down our drink order. The place was not busy at all. Then, this lady, who I think might be the manager, came to take our drink order, but it had already been taken. A family there before us ended up leaving because they never got their food. We found out the restaurant ran out of broccoli and meatloaf. After we got our drinks, it took another 10 minutes to take our food order. When our food finally arrived, almost an hour later, my fried apples were not included, but I didn't care at that point because I just wanted to eat and leave. We were given refills when we were done with our meals. Halfway through our meal, the manager came to our table to inform us that the turkey we didn't order could be remade. Finally we left."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd visit to this restaurant, and like the first visit was just as bad if not worse. Dirty glass ware. Dirty silverware. We both had the country boy. Flavorless eggs, over medium. Eggs were over medium well, country ham was pure shoe leather. Inedible, hash brown casserole was mediocre, my late grandmother s was better.  Country gravy carried a bad taste.      Manager came over, we told him the above he apologized, gave us our free meal card back. We gave it to the table next to ours to use. This cracker Barrell is the poorest run store. You can do much better elsewhere, the staff did not seem happy to be there, our server a male, seemed irritated he had to work on a Sunday.  A manager chased us out the door. We kept walking to our car. If you are going to your good home cooked food, make sure you can back it up......"}
{"text":"Welcomed even right before closing 
We were looking for something other than fast food and it was about 10 minutes until their closing time. We asked if we could still eat and were told of course. When they said it,we believed them.  Not only the management team but even the waitstaff exhibited this sincere welcome. Frankly we were expecting that maybe we would receive a meal just thrown together but it was as if we were the first guest not the last of the day. Out of appreciation and courtesy,  we were rushing eating but the waitress told us not to worry and enjoy our meal and not to feel like we had to hurry. Refills on tea were offered without asking and everything was done with a smile. Even the cashier who had waited for us to close out was warm and pleasant. By the way our food was delicious  and  cooked the way we asked"}
{"text":"Yes it's true. A little bit of country has come to Vegas.  This is the best of country you can get.  I have eaten at them all over the USA.  When I see it, I stop. 
Can't wait for them to come to California.  Ty was a great server at this location.  Service is a staple of all their store's."}
{"text":"Food and debris all over floor and chairs when we sat down. Medina the waitress was very nice and professional.  This place doesn't stack up to other Cracker Barrels we've been to.  Too dirty."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is a great, family friendly place to have a meal and shop around for some cool items. The country charm and the polite employees give this restaurant a homey vibe and the meals offered reflect this atmosphere. From breakfast classics like bacon and eggs to lunch and dinner options, Cracker Barrel has it all.

Once we were seated, we were delighted to see how many menu items there were. I eventually settled on what I believe was called Mama's Breakfast with a side of hash browns. A small aspect I appreciated was the peg game at the table, which I eventually bought later. Once our food arrived, everyone was extremely happy with the quality of the food. Everything was delicious, and didn't take very long to be made.

As we finished up eating and paid our bill, we visited the gift shop. The shop sold everything you could imagine, with just a few options being cooking materials, clothes, toys, furniture, and beauty products. It's an impulse buyers dream come true, and I ended up spending around $75 (whoops!). 

Overall Cracker Barrel is a fantastic restaurant and store where you can stock up on desired goods and enjoy a great meal."}
{"text":"I decided too give that place a try  boy there breakfast sucked  I hated there fried potatoes  .. will not go back there don't know why it's popular"}
{"text":"Unfortunately for Cracker Barrel, I know southern food  way too well.  Therefore, as a first time eater at their restaurant, I can't say that I walked away as a fan.  I had the meatloaf dinner, hubby had roast beef, and our three friends each had the fried catfish.  I do have to say that the total price for five was under $70.  Now, that's something to write home about."}
{"text":"???????????????????????????

{"text":"This place was great . Our server Dan was great and smiled a lot , breakfast was awesome ,eggs perfect , great experience"}
{"text":"The chicken fried steak was tough and chewy. The fresh fruit was hard and not sweet. The lemonade was tart. I had to add three packs of sugar, per class. The space between the tables were tight. The person behind us kept bumping into our chairs. The food wasn't that great. Fair customer service. I left the restaurant feeling queazy."}
{"text":"We waited less than 5 minutes to be seated and then were greeted by our server within 2 minutes. Our food also came out very quick. I got the egg sandwich with hash brown casserole, and it was very good. Great food and great service, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was dull. They overcooked my steak so it was very dry and tough. The hash browns were great but the best time to come is DINNER. I had the Chicken and Dumplin' and boy was that delicious! Great biscuits and gravy and Marconi and cheese! Yummy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. After waiting over an hour to get a table (since they are new, I knew there would be a wait), it took forever to get served. The waitress took our drink orders pretty quick (9 waters and 5 fountain drinks), she came back with our fountain drinks right away, but it took almost 20mins after that just to get the waters. Then it took another 20mins to get our food. I was seated at 7:30pm, and didn't get my food till almost 8:30pm. They need to get it together. Probably won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Omg the best country food ever!!!!! You won't hate anything on the menu! You'll always find new faves as well! The country fried steak is my ultimate fave! It's always perfection on the tongue! And you cannot leave without a sweet tea!!! Omg it's so good! Indefinitely recommend it no matter if it's breakfast, lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"It was just bleh. No flavor on the meat. Absolute Meh! Price is right so that's good. Hence, the two stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. What a bad experience!!!! I don't mind the 40 minutes it took to get our food, but when we finally got it...WOW! Biscuits were hard and gravy was cold. Ham was burnt and sausage was soooo hard!! Our waiter was no good. He never checked on us and we didn't get napkins until we were done eating. Such a bad time."}
{"text":"Our server was excellent but the quality of the food leaves much to be desired. We had barley ordered when the server came straight out with our food. Everything probably made ahead of time and sitting under heat lamps. My grilled chicken was very dry and lack luster along with the corn bread muffins. My husband ordered the sampler and it was all rather average. Best dish was the cornbread stuffing with gravy. Will be a while before we try again too many better choices."}
{"text":"Great service. Food that delivers on the brand promise. Fair pricing. What's not to love. Try the butter pecan pancakes for breakfast. You will NOT be disappointed.

Wish we had these in California!"}
{"text":"I found many Cracker Barrel's in TN. Never heard of it before and they were all over the place back east. Interesting enough I recently drove by this location and checked it out with a fellow nursing classmate and so happy I did. I very much enjoyed their service. Very pleasurable! I highly recommend their grilled trout, mac-N-cheese and biscuits. Reasonably priced! : )

I would say pass on the corn bread, chicken dumplings are an odd shape, texture and flavor. Not any chicken dumpling I've ever seen or tried. 

I also recommend purchasing their own brand label of a Cast Iron Skillet. A good size is only $20!! If you're a cook/chef at heart, it's a fabulous deal and quality! : )"}
{"text":"An excellent place for a nursing student like myself to unwind for comfort food after a hard exam! What a great way to reward myself with Cracker Barrell's mac and cheese! So addicting. I ONLY go after a nursing exam! Yum!"}
{"text":"Ok, every time we travel out of California in to Arizona or Nevada we enjoy eating at the Cracker Barrel restaurants. We like the old eclectic look and we are always treated vary well. On our way to Zion national park we stopped in Las Vegas and ate at the Cracker Barrel on N. Craig street. To our surprise it was very disappointing. The setting time was well longer than we were told. Our waitress Alejandra was very unattended and slow to bring us what we needed to enjoy our meal. The food, well the cooks did not take any pride in their work on this day. Needless to say we just ate completely unhappy to continue on our way."}
{"text":"Wow, I have been to Cracker Barrel's all over this great United States of ours, have had some of the greatest meals in my life. But this Cracker Barrel is in trouble, I had one of the worst meals in my life. My chef salad look to have been put together using the cooks feet. The staff was on organized, chaotic with zero communication skills. The manager was running around like a chicken with its head cut off not knowing which way to go or who to attend to. Corporate better get involved with this one or it will be a short-lived. You would think the first one in Vegas would have a little more experienced staff running it. To say I was extremely disappointed would be an understatement."}
{"text":"This morning I had breakfast here and it was not my cup of tea! I've had dinner here before and it was delicious!!! Place is good for dinner but I wouldn't recommended breakfast! Pork chop was dry, tough and tasteless. Biscuits were super tiny. Hashbrowns were soggy. Gravy and the apple butter jam was really good! Place is nice though, staff was great and the little \"market\" as you walk in is great! I love going through everything. This was just not a stop I would make for breakfast."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the loudest place on earth! It's so crazy in this place that I can't fault the waiters and waitresses. My girlfriend and I order the same thing every time \"Eggs in the basket, crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns\" and every time it looks like two different meals?? One's perfect and one looks under done and they always have to bring out my hashbrowns later..I like having my meal served all at once. I don't want to be hard on the staff because it's so crazy in there ...but man..I have a headache when I leave this place..."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel: where enterprising Americans born and raised north of the Mason-Dixon go to get their southern-style food gorging on.

I truly believe that if Cracker Barrel had been around early enough, we could've avoided the Civil War.

I thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast which consisted of:
2 biscuits
bacon
sausage
ham (country or sweet)
2 eggs any style
home fries casserole
grits (\"sure, I hearda grits...I just ain't neva seen a grit before\")
and a big heaping bowl of gravy

needless to say, I soon took a nice, albeit short (blame the family) nap on the rocking chairs out front."}
{"text":"I don't know if I was just hungry or what but the Mama's breakfast was super delicious. The pancakes tasted like homemade pancakes and the eggs weren't cook too hard nor were they too water. The service was pretty good. Everyone was helping everyone out I thought that was great teamwork and it's something that you hardly don't see nowadays with restaurants. This is one of the best cracker barrels that I've been to in a long time!"}
{"text":"I don't know why, but after a late, late night, if you order the \"Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast\" with chicken with the hash brown casserole side, I swear your unforeseen headache and \"Crap, is it morning already?\" thoughts drift away! There's just something so good about the fried unhealthiness bathed in thick gravy! The biscuits and gravy that just come as a side is nothing short of heavenly. Some restaurants have biscuits and gravy as an entree. They just give them away here! I love thee Cracker Barrel, even if you are a chain."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast with my fiancé and had a fun experience. The restaurant is very rustic and filled with neat decor on the walls. I ordered a hot apple cider, which was warm and delicious. My fiancé ordered the country boy and I ordered the French toast. The fried apples, French toast, eggs, hashbrown casserole and white toast was so good, lots of food, delicious biscuits and everything tasted good. Only took one star off for the country ham which was super dry."}
{"text":"Just did a roadtrip with some friends and literally ate at 5 different cracker barrels including this one. The good thing is we had a camper so slept in their lot and woke up each morning to have breakfast.  I wish we had some in Los Angeles.  The hashbrown casserole is my favorite."}
{"text":"Service was good. My meal was not complicated but was cooked poorly. I was offered to have it re-done. Was surprised by overlooked bacon 5 more seconds and they would have burned it and my undercooked and over cooked scrambled eggs that were obviously just cracked on the griddle. I am surprised as eat at Cracker Barrel a lot around the country. I have eaten at this one multiple times so I am writing this visit off as a one off. But hope they get to standard quickly."}
{"text":"This particular cracker barrel is complete shit with incompetent staff. We waited 35 minutes for a table for 10. We were then sepearated across the room into a party of 4 and a party of 6. When we asked to wait for a table for 10 they told us the wait would be 20 additional minutes. They also won't take reservations. Fuck you Cracker Barrel"}
{"text":"So to be upfront I have been enjoying Cracker Barrel for over 40 years.  I grew up in the south and truly enjoy Southern cuisine.  I was excited to finally be living near a Cracker Barrel.  
   I have been to this location 3 times - ate in twice and got to go once.  I got breakfast all three times.  I always get the Sunrise Sampler as it has so many goodies.  The amount of food you get on the Sunrise Sampler is over whelming.  You get 2 eggs, sausage, ham and bacon, biscuits and gravy and also grits.  It is more good than I can eat at one time.  I use the leftovers to make a fun breakfast the next day.  
   The service is always good and I get the Southern Hospitality feel even here in Vegas.  The Country Store theme is so cool and I feel like I am back in TN every time I am at a Cracker Barrel.  
   They now have online check in to help with the long wait times.  I highly suggest getting their App and checking in prior to driving to CB.  Now I am craving my Sunrise Sampler - a visit to CB is definitely needed soon!"}
{"text":"Worst Cracker Barrel food ever. Breakfast meat products, ham, bacon and sausage all appeared to be a week old. Dried out, and tasteless. Sausage like a hockey puck!

Beautiful store, great service and friendly people. Waitresses so sweet I didn't have the heart to complain!!!!!"}
{"text":"my best friend, boyfriend, and i come here every other week for some good southern style food and i normally don't post any review about our experience, but this time i'll give this place a little recognition. 

first off, coming here on the weekend can be a task because the business influx is ridiculous. but, with their check in system online, it becomes less taxing to wait. for the most part, the service is usually friendly and slow paced. we came today without any high expectations for service and food, but it was definitely one of the worst service experiences we had here. 

ordered the chicken fried chicken with different sides and added two eggs over medium to my order. the eggs didn't come till we were almost done with the food and they were not done correctly, which made the wait appear more annoying.

my boyfriend asked for ketchup and that never came so he just continued to eat his food without. i asked in the very beginning for tobasco sauce so the server wouldn't have to bring it later when she was busy, and she joked that i wouldn't be allowed to have it... but, then she totally forgot about it and i ended up asking the food runner Uly for it. he was so nice & it was after i asked three times that i wound up getting it. Uly was our one awesome listener since he brought the sauce without forgetting. 

our ice teas were never once refilled during our meal and the server Dani was not around for us to even ask, till we saw her towards the end when she dropped off our check. we asked for a box and bag... and she brought the box without the bag. overall, the service was terrible with the exception of Joseph who offered to take care of our drinks and a lady named Britney who was super nice to check on our eggs. 

we were on the way out when we the cashier asked about our experience and empathized with the lackluster service. he brought over Chase the manager. super friendly guy. appreciated the service of him taking the time to apologize for the experience and asked us to come back next time to make things better. i don't think ill be back anytime soon, but because of how things ended, i would give this another chance in the future. thank you joseph, britney, uly, & chase for excellent guest follow up service!"}
{"text":"We live in California but visited here while I'm Arizona and we're still dreaming about it! The biscuits are amazing! The apples were super good. I loved the hash brown casserole.. I think the only thing I had that I wasn't crazy about was the grits, and I'm just not really a grits person. Our waitress was great, she let us know that she could get us whatever we wanted, and the menu wasn't set in stone. Overall it was a fantastic experience and we want cracker barrel in California!!"}
{"text":"the food was good, but the dumpling was the wrong picked. Next time I will pick sweet potato instead."}
{"text":"After seeing my check in at Cracker Barrel, he asked, \"Did I lose a bet?\". To which I answered him, \"Not here by choice. Family chose Cracker Barrel, as no one wanted to drive around town on the eve of Thanksgiving\". I also told him it was as mediocre as I remembered, from my last visit to one of their locations in Arizona. 

Not to say the customer service wasn't good - because it was. Our server was very attentive but a little robotic, which was okay because she wasn't fake. It was as if she was following a script, with her questions and routine as she managed or served her station or tables. 

However, the food was borderline okay. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, with Macaroni & Cheese and Fried Okra. The Okra was tasteless. I should have asked for something to dip the pieces in for flavor, however, I just didn't bother. The Macaroni & Cheese was just plain and okay. I must be used to different variations which gives a different mix of flavors because the plain version just didn't hit the spot. The Chicken Fried Steak was a little on the bland side which was remedied with a little salt and pepper. The chicken was a little on the tough or chewy side but not to the point of returning my order. Sad to say, I enjoyed the side of Broccoli the most. Nothing to mess up as it was either steamed or boiled - not quite sure which nor did I care because it was fine either way. 

Anyway - it was years since my last visit to one of these locations and I won't be surprised if it's another few years before I return. I wasn't blown away with the food though I will say it wasn't awful. It just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Please don't rate down because of long waits for a table!  Good things come to those who wait!
Went Sunday morning for breakfast, 80 min wait estimate given, happy to wait. Spent 30 mins in store looking around their cool things then went outside sat in rocking chair in the shade, nice misting fans there to cool us off.  70 mins of waiting we were seated, 10 mins early.
Hosts were friendly, all of the staff are new, raising stars.  A few experienced staff floating around.  Served right away by new girl, seemed overwhelmed as place was packed.  She was pleasant enough, took order and left.  Coffee was coming around every few mins.
Meal arrived and was yummy as usual, no complaints.
I love the southern hospitality of Cracker Barrel, don't know if Vegas can deliver that true southern hospitality yet, time will tell."}
{"text":"A charming establishment with an old country feel. We were warmly greeted at the door to submit our name on the waiting list. While waiting to be seated at our table, we decided to browse around the county store which had some neat merchandise you don't see often nowadays. Looking at all their candy, sweets and soda pops from the earlier years reminded me of my childhood. It was a nice trip down memory lane.

Service was great, food arrived promptly and our dishes were to taste. Defiantly a great breakfast or brunch spot for all ages."}
{"text":"It's a CB. That's about all you need to know. We've been several times and have only had one server that wasn't great. We just chalked it up to it still being a new location. And this IS, still a new location. It's under a year old. It takes time to build a reliable staff and let's face it, the restaurant business in Vegas is ANYTHING but consistent. It's rare to find any restaurant that doesn't have a 3/4 turn over of staff year to year. 

That being said, you know what you're going to get here. Nice people, good food. 

The wait times are some of the longest I've ever experienced at a CB, (I've been to probably 15 different stores, spanning about 7 states) but the online check-in for a waiting list is a blessing for that, especially since it's about a 25 minute drive for us. 

We love CB, and will keep on coming back, especially for Sunday's fried chicken special!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips, and was underwhelmed.  My nephew and his wife seemed to enjoy their food... and the BLT salad I brought back to my friend was delicious... wish I would have gotten that instead of the fish and chips.  Our server was below par... nothing special, and would not go there again."}
{"text":"Great Food. Today I went to lunch with my friend. She ordered the Turkey Dinner. When we were halfway through the meal a very nice young man came up to us and asked how was our meal. My friend mentioned that her turkey was a little tough. Immediately he apologized and went to get her another plate. What a great experience. Mine, by the way was wonderful. Thank you, Cracker Barrel for hiring such good people and providing us with excellent food."}
{"text":"My wife has been craving Cracker Barrel food ever since we travelled through Arizona years ago. On our way back from our most recent camping trip in the Southwest we decided to visit the CB in Vegas. I had the lemon pepper salmon and my wife had the meatloaf - both very good. The bisquits were hot and fresh, the green beans and carrots were delicious and the lemonade was refreshing. All in all, a pleasant experience and a good meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Cracker Barrel!

We've tried numerous things on the menu and we haven't had a bad dish yet.  I usually get the lemon pepper trout which is delish!  However, the last time I went I got the pot roast.  Talk about comfort food! The downside, for whatever reason they didn't give us our cornbread and biscuits, which was included in our order.

The service is usually top notch.  With how often we frequent this place there has only been one server that wasn't quite up to par.  He was slow to take our order, seemed to rush through when he finally was taking our order, and didn't refill our drinks unless we asked. (And this is the same guy that didn't give us our biscuits.). But the other 20+ times we've been here, no complaints.

The best part?  A place to shop while you wait?  Genius!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a homey and country feel in a restaurant Cracker Barrel is the place for you! You walk in and are greeted with the sweetest novelty and nostalgic gifts and treats. They have seasonal items (thanksgiving things are out even though it's not even Halloween) on display and you're sure to find some fun things to do (checkers anyone? Rock in a rocking chair outside?) if you have to wait to be seated. 

The food is always hot and delicious. If you're stopping in for breakfast: the apple butter is a must try! So is the hash brown casserole. And the country fried steak. Well all of the breakfast items are amazing (this is my favorite type of food). The lunch and dinner items are delish too - a side of green beans with meatloaf are on point! They also offer sweet tea! Yum-o!! 

And each table is adorned with a lantern (it's stuck to the table people so don't try to move it out of the way) and a small game - an almost impossible game to win. 

This is definitely one of my fav breakfast places to visit!"}
{"text":"I am ok with the long wait- exactly an hour. After being seated it took 20 minutes and no server for us to ask someone to at least get our drink order. A red shirt lady did take that and our food order. Another 10 and  our waiter came with our drinks 4 coffees and one unsweetened ice tea. One coffee cup clearly dirty and sweetened tea. Another 10 to get one cup of coffee and an unsweetened ice tea. Food arrived cold, dried out. I boxed mine up. Family ate theirs. It only took two minutes after getting our cold food to be handed the bill. Although it was crowded, and everyone else around us seemed to have great service, Steve sucked, the food poor, and dirty cups turned me off. Love my Cracker Barrels. Will try this one again in the fall to see if it improves."}
{"text":"We visited On a Saturday morning before a day of shopping. Our server was awesome and attentive, but not in a nagging and annoying way. We did not have to wait long for our food and everything was hot and delicious. The hash brown casserole and turkey parties were my favorites. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, I eaten in CBs all over the US and this was a low point.  Skimpy portions, slow service and they were not even busy.  Go somewhere else, this place needs a refresh."}
{"text":"This place was extremely busy. It's funny seeing everyone waiting rocking back and and fourth on the rocking chairs in front. Took about 45 min to get table for group of 6. The store in front of restaurant very cute and unique. Staff was very friendly ! Unfortunately not impressed by the food at all. Biscuits and gravy was bland no flavor. Turkey sausage was hard. Pecan  pancakes would have been better with less pecans in them. The hash brown casserole was okay , Eggs & turkey bacon were cooked good . It's confusing how the mix everything on small plates too . They put my husbands and I food together , my children ended up having 2 plates each taking up too much room and making it more difficult to move food around so I could cut there pancakes  . I have 3 children , so those of you who have few kids understand this lol . 

I was really excited to try a new breakfast spot but this one I will not go back to ."}
{"text":"Ah, Cracker Barrel, you are so bad for me, but when I see you I must have something slathered in gravy immediately!  Yes, it is more food than any one person should ever eat in one sitting, but it so cheap I feel I must eat it!  

This is your standard CB.  Old rustic Americana look and feel.  Home cooking comfort foods on the menu. Cheap prices.  Good Service.  No booze (it takes away from the family atmosphere, apparently). 

I love their breakfasts and the chicken fried steak/chicken. Plus, meals come with either cornbread or biscuits.  The fried okra and fried apples are two of my favorite sides. Plus, their pies and cobblers are warm delicious gooey goodness. 

This one is near Cubs Park and the big ole Bass Pro Shop in Mesa. It is great if you are in the mood for comfort food and a lot of it!"}
{"text":"We were told the wait would be an hour long. We did wait 1hr and 20 min. I had checked one time about 50 mins into our wait time to see where our name was on the list. We were the next party to be called however a woman complained to the manger Daniel Nicholson in which that woman and her party had arrived later than we did and he gave her our seating. We had to wait additional minutes to be seated even though we were next to be called. Their costumer service is very poor. I believe everyone is equally important and everyone should be treated equally. In which they should have asked her to wait until we got seated then the will accommodate her party the best way possible."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong with CrackerBarrel. Ive never been disappointed with their food or service. Great breakfast options as well as dinner."}
{"text":"I always find it hard to find decent breakfast places. I recently had a business meeting at Cracker Barrel and was happy with y experience. They have a large breakfast menu so there is something for everyone. Their little store also has some unique gifts, which are perfect for stocking stuffers.

Bring a big appetite for here!"}
{"text":"Drab bland-tasting food,  excellent servers & employees. Though...Very loud, very rowdy, atmosphere.....lotsa,lotsa hillbillies, and red necks..all big huge and old customers, ...in this place you will feel comfortable ordering 2 main dishes and an appetizer And dessert. They are an Equal opportunity Employer, every employe of every background works at this specific location.fat, huge, ugly,white black,Indian, Filipino, Mexican, many gays overall.     Kevin is the best over-the -top most vivacious waiter ever. And Geneva is a such a delight too. Even the mgr,.is great. Take the livers off the menu, they are always out of them, and they came burnt once.....and the other time completely un-cooked and bloody...p.s.need a bigger parking lot...always packed to the gills..."}
{"text":"We tried to eat at this location Thursday May 17th.  We walked out after 1 1/2 hours waiting for our food.  
Someone needs to come in and get this resturant back into sgape."}
{"text":"I usually love this location but not today especially when you order a drink and it doesn't come to the table until you're half way through your lunch your raspberry lemonade comes warm with no ice cubes, biscuits with no butter and the waiter got my moms order completely wrong 3 times today"}
{"text":"Food was great! Large portions and excellently cooked! Classic country food... must try their apple butter and sweet potatoe pancakes!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Our waitress this time was Karen! Man what spunk!!!! She was funny! Definitely turned a bad experience (Liam ) into an awesome experience!!!! She had us laughing the whole time! Definitely an asset to Cracker Barrel! Gave as an off the menu tip... instead of Momma's breakfast... we got grandma's breakfast... OH YES!!!!!"}
{"text":"Once again, I had an enjoyable meal. I really don't understand the bad reviews. I've been to Cracker Barrel many times here and in Arkansas where I'm from, I always had good service and good food."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage!!! After being seated the waitress took the drink order and about 12 minutes later brought out just my my beverage. Places an order foe the country boy breakfast and wifey had the salad with grilled chicken. 15 minutes later my plate comes out and she says we are still waiting on the salad??? Lol 5 minutes later she brings it out. My eggs was cooked hard done when I asked for over easy, the biscuits was undercooked, and the server by the name of Mickey was absolutely a disaster. She didn't offer to remake the dish or anything. Never refilled my coffee. Just terrible at the job.  Kind of a let down bc the cracker barrel back in home in Mississippi is great. Ow well avoid this place and just grab a breakfast buffet in the Silverton across the street."}
{"text":"I love coming here! The food is always fresh and good. I get to switch up on my veggies, which is what I love.  The campfire chicken is back for a limited time but it is SooOoO good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in years, so I thought it would be a good idea to go with some friends. I was wrong. The only positive part of the entire experience was Ryan, the host. We were immediately greeted, and seated. We were then approached by a young lady, who took our drink order. After receiving our drinks, and placing our food order, we proceeded to wait for a solid 30 minutes, and the only thing that was brought to our table was a salad that a friend of mine had ordered. The server wasn't attentive enough to notice that our food had been neglected, because when it finally reached the table, it was at room temperature. Then had to ask for a manager who apologized, comped the meals, and gave an order to go, for a friend of mine who had to be at work. I, and my friends have agreed to not return to this location. Good luck Ryan."}
{"text":"Ehh..the food is okay, waitresses are always nice. The mashed potatoes and gravy have no salt/ flavor..the hash brown casserole (that I've heard so much rave about) was hard and cold..i like the fried catfish it was very soft..but other than that not really impressed."}
{"text":"Visited this Cracker Barrel yesterday and was horribly disappointed by the quality of the food. Where five months it seemed to have improved, my breakfast was bad, the French Toast was tough and was like dried toast and the fried apples given to me was mostly liquid like they we the bottom of the pan. My wife's hash browns tasted like they were processed out of frozen potatoes not well cooked. In addition, The wait time for our food was also long and noticed another couple get up and leave disgusted because of the wait time. The only positive was the waiter who was being trained was very nice and tried. We are regulars to this place and if it wasn't like waiter like Zach who have waited on us in the past and enjoy seeing him as well as several others we would not return! You can do better Cracker Barrel step up and do it!"}
{"text":"Great Spot For Home Cooking Food!

Great sweet tea!

Great country fried steak or chicken meals!

Great prices!

Great sides, especially the yummy okra!

Cool atmosphere.

Friendly Service too!"}
{"text":"Nice experience! I was seated right away and the server, Ashley, was VERY friendly and attentive. Food was very good; I can't say that for some of the other visits I've had at the Chandler location. I will definitely be back and will ask for Ashley."}
{"text":"The food was better than any Cracker Barrel I have eaten at but the wait was incredibly long & I felt like we were packed into the dining area like sardines!  My husband could not sit next to me because the person from the table behind us was halfway into his space! Probably won't be back for awhile until the hype of having Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas dies down."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant, CB is pretty awesome. I love the variety in their menu (sometimes I stare at it, unable to decide). And for someone who isn't a good cook (me!), it's nice to go out for an affordable, home-cooked meal. 

I love the country store attached to the restaurant. Fun to browse, and I've found some great birthday/holiday gifts there, too!"}
{"text":"Country style meal is good sometime. The food were kind of standard in every branch. Server is always nice. I recomend here for family meal."}
{"text":"Had never had the pleasure of dining at one, so I took the plunge around sunrise, two hours into a road trip.  Heard it was better than Denny's.  Also heard that you can buy furniture and novelty items there.  All of this is true, along with its stubbornly unique décor.  

Scarfed down Momma's French Toast Breakfast.  Thought to myself, is this the best French toast I've ever had?  Nope.  Far from the best I've had, but certainly not the worst.  It was just kinda humdrum, the same way I felt about the melancholic bacon strips and the plain looking scrambled eggs.  Nothing was really wrong with them.  They were fine I guess.  

On a whim, jumping onto the wild side, I ordered a chocolate milk to go with my first meal of the day instead of coffee.  Was presented a paltry TruMoo carton, low-fat, maybe even fat-free, gave it that weird aftertaste.  Yuck.  Who enjoys drinking that stuff?  Drank it anyway, hoping that it would taste better further in.  It did not.

The blueberry pancakes looked super blueberry-ey.  Declined the tasting offer, not because I'm against blueberries, quite the contrary, but simply due to the fact I wasn't feeling those blueberry pancakes right then and there.  Was told they were OK.

Service and such was satisfactory.  Our server was as friendly as one would expect from a Cracker Barrel at the break of dawn after a long Friday night.  Our food came quickly, the bill wasn't screwed up and the restroom was relatively clean.  

I'd say my rating is closer to 2 1/2 stars than 3."}
{"text":"Man sized portions is what you get at Cracker Barrel! The chicken fried steak is fantastic and oversized to the point that you can't help but to smile when you see it. The gravy is the same as their biscuits  and gravy which is thick and delicious.

I will not go here with out getting at least one side of their apple butter for the biscuits as well. The food is a home cooked meal type of food and reminds me of my mom's cooking.

You get the feeling that you are in a log cabin or an older country home with the decorations all around. The old county store that you walk into upon entering the restaurant  is peaceful and relaxing itself. Just going to eat here is like a vacation that makes me want to move to the country, and feel sorry for what society has become."}
{"text":"First time trying this restaurant, I would recommend if your in the area! Definitely a popular place in Arizona, I tried the country fried steak it was good but not the best I've had. The hash brown casserole is a different story now that's the best hash brown I've tried! Our waitress was a sweet heart very attentive and kind. They even have a small shopping store with cute items and goodies"}
{"text":"Delayed review of Thursday January 5, 2017. We went with a party of 8. Our waitress was very friendly and took our order. I've eaten at this chain before and know what the menu is so we ordered away. As the food  started to be brought out it was delivered in random order and some of the guys ordered combination breakfast items. Half orders were brought out and understandably especially with a big group you expect several trips maybe even wait a couple minutes in between. Wait we did and when the orders arrived some were wrong, gravy for biscuits arrived cold, and overall it just went from I can't wait to let's get out of here. No manager addressed the table even with food sent back. My Turkey sausage was delivered but by the time the eggs arrived they were cold. I paid my bill and cashier asked me how was your meal.......i said I hate to say it but they couldn't get anything right. She was nice offered a manager however, my party was walking out. Not sure I'm coming back to this location."}
{"text":"I'll come back whenever I'm in Vegas. Love the place and the service and especially, the food!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel they have something for everyone. Service is always friendly just once we had a problem where we had to move from our original table because they sat us down accidentally then they took over 8 min for us to get our drink order taken. We had to get the managers attention. 

That will still not change my mind about how awesome this place is. We completely stopped going to IHOP and Denny's this place is so much better. Their blue berry muffin is one my favorites. Their pancakes are made out of cratch! I mean you don't get that out of a franchise.  It feels very cozy and welcoming."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to dine there.  We had it a few times as take out, at work, and it was good.  But I got there for breakfast one morning, right as they opened.  I cannot remember my server's name, but she was a very kind African-American Lady.  She was very good and very quick with my food.  She kept my tea glass full, too.  I ordered the Grandpa's Country Breakfast with Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs, Fried Apples, Grits and Biscuits.   And the steak was good and tender.  The gravy was outstanding.  My eggs were cooked right.  The apples were good.  I don't eat grits.  And the biscuits were late getting to the table, but they were hot and fresh, so no complaints.  I felt bad for the staff, as there were a couple of guys who had clearly been drinking all night that came in and were being rude and complaining about the food.  The staff handled it well and were all very good and kind.  I enjoyed my breakfast."}
{"text":"My family and I love cracker barrel since we dont have one  in San Diego we take advantage to eat in cracker barrel in AZ when we are on a trip but this place have terrible service ,we waited 10 mins for our waiter or waitress but no one show up so we decided to leave. While we are walking out the manager and other staff sitting on the table .....very disappointed ."}
{"text":"The Maple Jam and Bacon burger was great and Lisa G was incredible. Her service was second to none"}
{"text":"Old fashioned and traditional Americans 
Breakfast food. To die for! Great big portion. With quality food"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here. Reminds me of Tennessee. Food can sometimes be on the bland side but all Cracker Barrel's are that way."}
{"text":"Good food good service priced very well. Can usually get in and out rather quickly. Just a good old fashion breakfast."}
{"text":"People were friendly and service was good. Food was edible, but not the best I've ever had and it was a little bit expensive for what I got. I was on a road trip and was looking for a nice breakfast and got what I was looking for, however it was indeed only a nice breakfast, not incredible. It was totally good for a mid road trip breakfast and getting to pick up a souvenir or two from the Country Shop was fun, too."}
{"text":"The classic Cracker Barrel home style food in Vegas! Yay. Finally went yesterday. I wasn't disappointed at all. Except that they were out of baked sweet potatoes. Our servers, Kathi and then Valerie were attentive, caring and super nice. I love being able to grab a package of Goldenberg's Peanut Chews on my way out too. We will be back. You can't beat the prices for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Food never disappoints but this new location really needs to improve in the service. Our waiter forgot a lot of items so we had to remind her of them. She would forget one item after another. 
I love this restaurant. Will come back for the food. Will try the other store too to compare"}
{"text":"Came in sort of late, about a half hour before closing. I got zero attitude from the staff -- nothing but bright, happy faces. I was seated near the fireplace. I ordered the chicken and dumplins, a first for me. They were delicious. My server, Sarah, was intelligent, efficient, and charming. I never wanted for anything. Then the bill came. I was expecting something much higher. I look forward to going back, again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to try cracker Barrel because everyone made such a big fuss about it , and boy was it a let down. My eggs were cold and dry ... grits and gravy were completely watered down. Such a shame because we wanted to like it !!!! I will say that our waitress was super friendly."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in years.  This one did not disappoint.  Friendly staff, fast service, and good food.  All this and it was during Father's Day rush."}
{"text":"Great Location right off of i-17. This is the least busiest cracker barrel I have been to. And now it's my new favorite location because so. I wonder if it is because of the fact that it's sort of hidden?"}
{"text":"I can never get enough of this place. Probably my favorite spot to get breakfast. I can always count on great service and food here!"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could. Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had a cracker barrel.  Terrible service by just about everyone.. our server Rachel rolled her eyes everytime I asked for something.  They screwed up a salad... A SALAD!!  I will not be returning to this cracker barrel EVER!!"}
{"text":"So pleased with the team here at this location. Great servers with positive welcoming personalities and excellent service. We travel a good amount and find various Cracker Barrel's to dine at and we chose to return to this one three times. Who ever trains the staff here has a great approach because you see consistent employee service. definitely go back when we return to the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Service was great and my chicken fried steak was so friggin delicious! Cheaper and great quality compared to a restaurant I usually grab from for chicken fried steak. This might be my primary spot to buy chicken fried steak from!"}
{"text":"Olivia made the breakfast/lunch experience. She gave great service and recomendations, was friendly and patient.....wish we had more places like this at home- seattle area."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for their PECAN PANCAKES.

They are the best pancakes I've had in a long time. For me, pancakes are about the texture, fluffiness, thickness, and taste. These are seriously delicious, thick, fluffy and delicious. The first time I had them, they had crisp outer edges which is my favorite way to have pancakes. The second time I had them, the edges were not crispy at all but still tasted great. Next time, I will see if I can ask for crispy edges.

I would go back to Cracker Barrel again and order these pancakes over and over again. 

I have tried the french toast, chicken fried chicken, and some other things, but the Pecan Pancakes are what I would consider a perfect tasting and fluffy thick pancake!"}
{"text":"Oh Cracker Barrel I am so upset at how close I live to you! I think it's cute to see the older folks sitting outside on the rocking chairs and playing with their awesome oversize checkers. The little store inside is wonderfully nostalgic and a great distraction for when you're super hungry and waiting. I love getting their pot roast dinner, as for breakfast their pancakes are amazing! They give you a hot bottle of syrup and don't forget to ask for some apple butter!"}
{"text":"Hash brown casserole is gross. Not big on the homey taste. But I do like the game on the table for kids and the checkers. Retail OVER priced. Food is reasonable"}
{"text":"We were really pleased with this Cracker Barrels food and the items in the store for sale. I think Peoria is such a nice little town. And the items sold here seems to fit the feel of the town.

I usually get the same thing: Fish, Grits and Eggs meal. I like the biscuits and the hash brown casserole thing, My BF gets something different each time. This time he had ham and pancakes, eggs over easy and apples. Everything was good!"}
{"text":"My wife had never gone here until I took her. Me having lived in Florida and Louisiana I love this kinda home cooking that you don't get really anywhere else here in the valley. I LOVE the chicken and dumplings! They are the best. My wife likes the fried shrimp and chicken fried steak. The Mac n' cheese, the Fried Okra and the cheesy potatoes are my favorite sides. Their breakfast puts the boots to any other similar breakfast place. The pancakes are amazing, the bacon is awesome, the waffles are the best.  Plus on top of the amazing food you get to roam the Country Store while you wait or after your meal. Tons of old skool candy treats, and a bunch of stuff you would never buy but is fun to look at :) I love going to Cracker Barrel any time and have never been to a bad one!"}
{"text":"Not very high quality food but the relatively low price helps make up for it.  If you want quantity over quality, you'd be satisfied here."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by someone I know has similar taste in food and once again it was a success.  I arrived with a party of 4 and our wait time was 25 minutes but luckily we only had to wait 15 of those minutes.  It was of course hotter than the devils armpit outside but the misters made the wait very manageable.  Plus there are cool rocking chairs for guest to sit while they wait and potentially purchase.  I definitely felt like I was sitting on the front porch at my neighbors house, it was very comfortable.  Anyway, once seated we were greeted promptly by our server Jacque ( I hope I spelled that right).  Jacque made our experience very pleasant. My girlfriend and her parents were grateful for the flexibility when it came to switching out items on the combinations they chose to better suit their desires. The food was awesome.  I tried momma's pancake breakfast with a side order of hash brown casserole.  The pancakes were cooked perfect with that delicious crisp around the edges. I love that the pure natural syrup comes in a small glass bottle, although one bottle is not enough for the three pancakes you get with that meal I was still very satisfied. You get a choice between sausage and bacon, I chose the sausage and thought it was fine but my party thought it was to salty.  The hash brown casserole was a nice addition to the meal for some extra flavor and texture.  I made sure to purchase a box of the pancake mix for my cousin Ola (the person who recommended this place) for telling me about this place.  Thank you Jacque for the wonderful service and thank you cracker barrel for the great food"}
{"text":"[Read in the voice of Kelly Kapoor from The Office]

Ohmigod, this Cracker Barrel is totally awesome.  The waitresses are like so nice, and the food is like so awesome!  I love biscuits 'n' gravy!  So, when you walk in, you totally find yourself in the middle of this old timey country store, where you can buy like all kinds of really cool knick-knacks and tchotchkes.  Then, you sit down at this cool table, and you can play with this awesome game with pegs and stuff.  I couldn't figure out the point of it, but it was so much fun, ohmigod.  My grits were so cheesy and awesome--not unlike my favorite movie, Love Actually--and so were the warm caramelized apples.  Ham and bacon were tasty, too.  I, like, totally can't wait to go back to this super awesome restaurant!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to the Cracker Barrel in a while and tonight we were really craving it
We were seated quickly and our server came to take our drink orders
He was a nice young man 
I ordered the Roast Beef and my three sides were Steak Fries, Mac n Cheese, and Pinto Beans
They were all amazing!! Just like I remembered...

The roast beef and beans were my favorite but the fries and Mac and cheese were equally yummy

Our service was pretty good too even though the restaurant was getting busier as it was nearing dinner time 

We even got talked into splitting a peach cobbler with ice cream
It was deelish 

Also, the meal was pretty cheap and that made the visit even more enjoyable
Great food at a good, low cost :)"}
{"text":"My first time in a Cracker Barrel restaurant and I'm disappointed. There was a very long wait for lunch (45 mins or so) so we were really hungry when we finally were seated. We ordered our lunches and waited about 25 minutes for the food to arrive. During that wait we were never offered refills for our coffee nor could we catch our server's eye to ask for refills. The place was very packed and the servers were all running ragged. 

When the food finally arrived it was average tasting. The worst part was, it was warm, not hot. Cooked food should be served HOT! My dish was a lunch with fried catfish, mashed potatoes and whole kernel corn. It was just barely ok, because it was just barely warm. 

Disappointed. Should have gone to Denny's instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a road trip for brunch. 
I had the sunrise sampler it was so much food but delicious eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, grits, apples, biscuits and gravy. I couldn't eat it all of course. The sweet tea is good too.The server was extremely nice with southern hospitality what a great experience.
The country store is really cute they have a variety of items clothes, sandles, hats, trinkets, candy ect. the list goes on you can spend a good hour looking thru it all. 
I will stop again at this location  on my way back thru."}
{"text":"Being from Texas, Cracker Barrel is a staple. Memories of my mother buying knick knacks and getting to pick out those candy sticks. I was intrigued upon finding out about the Robinson location and wondered whether it would live up to the locations down south. And let me tell you, it sure does! The chicken n dumplins and chicken fried steak are my favorites here and this location did not dissapoint!"}
{"text":"We (my fiance and I) usually love Cracker Barrel for its cheap pricing for a lot of home cooked kind of meals. However the one on Carowinds Boulevard has terrible service and dry, tasteless food! We waited 15 minutes to even see our waitress and then she disappeared until our food came out to the table. Then we asked for a refill on the refillable sweet tea and we only got one after asking 3 times for it. She didn't delay on giving us our bill first, though. We felt rushed out after not feeling like we existed to the waitress. It was the first time we ever tipped below 15%...with a 0. The food we received was dry, the dumplings were undercooked (still tasted doughy), and we were rather thirsty from the lack of a refill (we were at Carowinds all day so we were rather thirsty from the heat/sun). I would rather feel starved and wait to eat until we get closer to home next time. The only highlight for me was the peppermint sticks that can be bought in the country store."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets really busy during the weekends so it's best to hit it up early on a weekday. I love the cute store that is in it with old fashioned candy and drinks and other cute little Knick knacks for the home.

We were greeted by 3 people to make sure our drinks were ordered so they are on it. We ordered our food and it was the largest portions of food I have ever received.

I had eggs, country fried steak, hash brown casserole, grits,  and gravy and biscuits! Full! 
It was good but certainly not the best breakfast I've had. It seemed like everything was a bit under seasoned and maybe that's purposely so we can season our own. The biscuits were really good though. Yum!"}
{"text":"Service was great but food leaves much to be desired.. definitely overrated.. all the hype for blend, flavorless and poorly presented food.. maybe it's just the Vegas locations.."}
{"text":"Wifey and I refer to this place as \"Coma Barrel\" because that is what it is: carby, salty, full on fatty foods. There's good reason why they have rocking chairs out front.

Wait time was about normal for this chain, which is in the 15-20 minutes at peak service time. I simply do not understand why they never build these places with more seating. More seating = faster turnover = less wait time = happier customers.

While the food is good, it is not hard to tell that a lot of it is mass produced and then held at temperature. Problem with that is food degrades quickly. It would be nice if they didn't shave their pork chops down to 3mm because they are quite good.

Service was very good, which is normal for this chain.

Overall, not the greatest, but probably the best option along 480/Tiedeman."}
{"text":"Well here's what I have to say about this place. The store is adorable! On the other hand the food is just lousy. I don't see what all the rave is about this place at all as far as the food goes. Now to be fair I'm sure there are some things on the menu that are quite enjoyable like the pancakes and the fried apples . Now on the other hand the biscuits and gravy and grits and the sausage and the bacon honestly we're absolutely the pits! For me to go to breakfast I need more than ambience and good service the food here I can't give more than a solid 2."}
{"text":"I have been going to Cracker Barrel for a long time now in Utah and Arizona, but today I went to the one in Vegas for the first time. Extremely unhappy not the same!! First off the food service was very slow and she kept forgetting things. Second the food was very bland. The corn bread was the worst I have ever tasted no flavor at all! I had the signature dish country fried steak and the steak had no flavor and the white gravy was so thick I can taste the flour and it had no flavor and was very cold. To top that there was barely any gravy on my steak or mashed potatoes!! Everything I ordered tasted the same all the food was very bland! My mother-in-law had the same thing. She also had a piece of hair in her food so we told the waitress and she got the manager!! When the manager came over we told him about the hair and he stated \" ooo no I will take care of it\" all with his head down like he did not care then walked off!! He had no customer service and was very rude about it! After we got the check I went to pay and the lady behind the cashier we very nice but she asked if we had a good meal and I told her how I felt. She got the manager again and again I told him why I was not happy. I stated there was a hair in my mother food and he stopped me half way through my sentence and stated \" And I took care of that\" ( extremely rude tone) very disrespectful. I explained to the manager I am not looking for free food. Just wanted you to know so it does not happen again and furthermore Cracker Barrel has a better reputation then the service and food we receive today. Along with a manager that was respectful and understanding!! I don't think I will ever go back to that Cracker Barrel again!! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, happy and cozy atmosphere. Delicious food. Consistent. Most of the entrees are under $10, amazing value for the money. SO Much better than Denny's, cleaner, better variety, and more homey! Cool gift store too"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch yesterday and we were very happy with our experience. The food was tasty and filling (hefty portions) and the pricing is really good (especially for what you get). Customer service was great and everyone from the hostess to our waitress just made us feel welcomed. The only advice I'd give is to come early and be prepared to wait. My husband and I waited 30 minutes for a table for 2. The good news is, they have comfortable rocking chairs, fans, and mist to cool you off while you wait."}
{"text":"Service was horrible took over 25 minutes to goer our food. I ordered vegetable plate with 4 items, I was brought all 4 items I individual bowls didn't get a plate to put food on or for s place to put my biscuits. The all over experience was terrible complained to manager he got me a plate and that was it"}
{"text":"Pretty average fare for a chain, but consistency throughout is good, right?

Went in for brunch on way out of town as there wasn't much else open for breakfast except fast food at 11am on a Tuesday.  Went in with party of 5 and waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table to be cleared.  

Got seated and served fairly quickly by a waitress who was t happy and seemed overworked. Got the biscuits a d gravy, which were ok, but not great, warm when served, and some lukewarm hash browns.

All and all it was ok, but like most of the time I will try and avoid this chain unless I'm desperate for breakfast food. It is cheap and you get what you pay for I suppose.

Side note: bathrooms were really clean which is a nice plus for a busy place like this."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! This is the second time I've come and same result. Both times I was sat and told my server would be right with me. After 10 minutes the first time and 5 this time (better)I had to flag someone down to order coffee and by that time food. They took the order 20 minutes later first time and 28 second time the food was brought out by someone else. The first time the only time I saw my server was when he dropped the check. Second time my server dropped off the food but no contact from anyone to even refill coffee for the 28min I was waiting. I Understand it gets busy. But from what I could tell each server has 2-3 tables. That's not that much. Not impressed I like the food but not enough to be ignored and basically beg for it. I started writing this after I finished my meal and I'm still waiting for the check."}
{"text":"Waiting and waiting and waiting... 
Finally a manager, oh the girl entered the ticket incorrectly...dinner is on us...right. Just bring me my damn food. I've been here so long my phone is going dead! 
Huge disappointment tonight! And turn off the AC. It's freezing outside.
Train or help the new kid!!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Cracker Barrel thanks to my mother being an employee when I was young. The waitress was a nice sweet lady that brought us coffee as fast as possible. We had the egg and cheese sliders with some fruit and they were pretty good. I always enjoy the atmosphere and the memories that it brings back to me."}
{"text":"Darrahde is no longer there, but we still go in from time to time. I really like their vegetable meal.  Cabbage, beans and kale. Their chicken liver meal with Mac & cheese is very good."}
{"text":"We were on vacation and my wife said she had never eaten at a Cracker Barrel.  Well, I had never been to one either, so we figured why not. 

The parking lot was full and there was people waiting outside, so it was pretty busy. As you enter the restaurant, there is a store front where they sell various items from toys, gadgets, clothing, and decor. It was interesting. Our wait time was about 15-20 minutes which wasn't too bad considering the amount of people there. I peeked into the dining area and noticed that there were lots of tables and seating, most of which was occupied. I was glad to see this because it meant that even though there was a lot of people waiting, people would get seated shortly since there was a lot of tables. 

I ordered the hamburger steak, eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy. This was all included in one meal! So if you like large portions of food, you will not be disappointed here. The food was pretty good. It was equivalent to other diner style restaurants and I was not disappointed. Their biscuits were fluffy, and the gravy was thick. My wife ordered the fried pork chop meal, and she said it was good. Being our first time here, we enjoyed the food. I would love to give this place four stars, but as I stated earlier, it was equivalent to most diners. Service was friendly, and for the most part attentive. I'm sure that f we are in the vicinity of a Cracker  Barrel again, we would probably give it a try."}
{"text":"First time going to the location and I was absolutely impressed. My husband and I definitely recommend of course we went for breakfast the wait wasn't to long luckily I had some pancakes and my husband the steak breakfast everything was delicious we were absolutely amazed by the syrup. Great place"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  We were quoted an hour & 20 min. wait time which I knew it was going to be a long wait on a Sunday morning.  After an hour & 45 min we were finally seated!  I was quite upset already as I went up to the hostess table to see where we were on the list.  We were #4 I was told.  Okay...except they took at least 8 other people before us.  I noticed they sat all their parties of 4 (we were a party of 3) before us which didn't make sense because of course they had to sit us at a 4 top. We weren't asked if we wanted breakfast menus (which we did considering we got there at 10:15am).  I had to ask for them in which the waitress brought them right over.  I felt very rushed by our waitress. She gave us maybe 3 minutes before she asked if we were ready to order.  Luckily I had known what I wanted since I've been to other locations several times.  The food took another 45 minutes! (mind you we ordered breakfast!).  When we got the food my french toast & sugar cured ham were both cold! My son & daughter's pancakes were hot (so mine was obviously done first).  I didn't say anything because after 3 1/2 hours of getting to the restaurant I was starving!  The food itself was good. Just not amazing since it was cold.  The $6 piece of ham I got was very small, I cut very small pieces & only got through 1/2 of my french toast before it was gone. The poor experience I had was definitely due to the high volume.  It was odd though because there seemed to be an abundance of bussers who appeared to not have much to do.  Maybe they should have more cooks vs. bussers.  I hope to try this place again but not for a long time."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has been our family's favorite breakfast restaurant for 30 years. We've eaten at this Cracker Barrel dozens of times. Not any more. Something changed. They started serving our breakfast cold. We sent it back and it was still served lukewarm. We figured they had a bad day so the next time we politely ask them to make sure our breakfast was served hot. It was servied cold again. We talked to the manager and he apoligized. We tried eating there three more times and every time it was served cold. So, we stopped eating there. We now eat breakfast at the Waffle House where they we watch them make our breakfast and serve it directly to our table HOT. We miss the Cracker Barrel but I expect a hot breakfast and they can't seem to provide a hot breakfast."}
{"text":"I haven't been to one of these in a looong time...   Took my girl and a buddy of mine out tonight and had some good breakfast...  All 3 of us with tip ran me $37... not shabby.

- Lots of food... I had breakfast 
- GOOOOOOOD maple syrup... damn I could eat those pancakes w/ that syrup all frickin day
- still can't get into grits... idk wtf they're so popular for *shrug*
- eggs... sunny side up... goood
- hashbrown casserole?  I'd rather have normal hashbrowns but the new twist wasn't too shabby... good
- coke... (yes it's important) good...  proper amt of fiz
- biscuits & gravy... superb.
- Cinnamon Apples... NOM!

Again Price was good... I expected it to cost more honestly.

Service... great!  Guy was really nice and patient with our indecisiveness (mostly my ADD)

I'm not into the shopping area with all the kids toys and antiques... stuff my mom would love... to each his own...

I'll be back"}
{"text":"I'm so excited that there is finally a Cracker Barrel here in Las Vegas! I have been to both the St. George and Kingman locations and I have to say I love this Las Vegas location most! My Mom and I got here super early because we knew that coming here within the first 2 days of opening would be bananas but it was perfect! From getting greeted upon entry and the incredible and prompt friendly service carried throughout from the dining area to the country store, wow they certainly know how to open a brand new business in Las Vegas! This staff will get to know me, my Mom and friends quite well because I'm a lifer! I can't say enough from the pancakes being my absolute favorite thing here, and the best I've EVER had, to the great atmosphere! Cheers to many more amazing times at CB, good things I live reeeeeally close!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a 0 star rating. I love this restaurant chain and this was the first time we ever walked away from here to go to another restaurant. This Vegas restaurant needs to learn how to properly seat and retrain on hosting. We had a party of eight for breakfast and we're told that it would be a 2 hour wait and we would all have separate tables we could not eat together. Apparently they don't know how to push two tables together. They need to go have some training in the mid west restaurants to see how they do it. Very disappointed!! New management is needed!!!"}
{"text":"I am so disappoint with this Vegas location. 

After waiting what felt like an hour for our food, we found that nearly every given meal was almost cold - and very tasteless. One of us ordered and steak, and it was noticeable that it wasn't even cooked on a grill but on a flat pan; meaning it was very dry. Not to mention, he ordered medium done and it was well done. 

After addressing some of these issues, our waitress stated that it was because their cooks were working very slow back there. ?????? Oh. 

I have to say, our waitress was very nice and accommodating, but the cooks and food runners need to work together to provide appetizing meals. 

TIP: Set a reservation in advanced - no matter what time of day it's for."}
{"text":"By far the WORST experience we have ever had at a Cracker Barrel. I personally was introduced to Cracker Barrel two years ago, but my husband has been eating at them for years and years. His mom and him LOVE it because they are from Texas and always say they can count on good southern cooking. Unfortunately this visit was not the case. It started with my husbands silverware being dirty, we went through three different sets. 

When our food arrived we were shocked. My husband and I ordered the same meal, the chicken and dumplings plate. I honestly should have taken a picture but I was more caught up in dealing with the situation. When our meals arrived my husbands plate had literally half the amount of chicken and dumplings on it than mine did. Extremely confused we showed our waitress who quickly went to the kitchen to get more. You could tell she did everything she could to help, but the silverware was a dishwashers issue and the food was clearly the cooks. 

The times I have been to Cracker Barrel with my husband I always eat breakfast. Wanting to try something new he swore by the chicken and dumplings as this is his go to dish. After getting clean silverware and the correct portion, we started eating. After a few bites (and asking for hot sauce) he asked me what I thought of if. I was honest and said it was the most bland thing I had ever eaten and was confused why he liked it so much. The look said it all. He was just as upset. He said it had never tasted like this and was thrown off by the whole experience. 

For the next 10-20 minutes we were continuously asked if we were done eating as it was clear they were wanting to rush people. This was done by bussers and other wait staff not our waitress. 

Finally we finish our meal and go pay. We're asked how our meal was and we say \"not so good for xyz reasons\". The response? 

\"Your total is 43.18\"

Wow. Thanks but no thanks. Spend your money elsewhere!!! 


3/7 update... after no one at this location contacted me I decided to reach out to corporate. They don't seem to care either. In which case I won't be doing business here ever again."}
{"text":"Got the chicken salad salad. Was so excited as it was good last time. This time 4 small pieces of chicken , a ton of huge chunks of celery. We told waitress she goes that is the portion they give you. Ok so the chicken salad is now 90% celery good to know. Very disappointing and customer service bad. She never came back to check on us. Won't be back. I can spend my money where they care."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great today. Biscuits were over cooked.
The waitress kept forgetting what the order was. The restaurant was pretty empty and guess because the food wasn't that good"}
{"text":"I was a little anxious for them to open (Craig/Losee) so once this happened my daughter and I went for dinner.  Basically, the food was very bland; wasn't much flavor to anything on our plates.  The dumplings were a little weird - almost like they were frozen in advance.  Have to say that this trip to the  Cracker Barrel didn't inspire us to go back.  Their country store is fun to browse/shop - but other than that it was just meh."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. Terrible service and horrible food. After explaining to the waitress Id never been there and needed time she still came over every minute. We ordered food and in 4 minutes tops it was on our table. My bread was soggy, all the food was mixed together on the plate and the food was cold.
We left the food there and will be eating at home instead.
Disgusting, I would never go again and would give 0 stars if I could. I cant believe they even have business."}
{"text":"The food is good, service was fair, as I have visited other locations, wait time was only a few minutes early in the morning. 
Down side was dirty silverware and chunks of old dry food stuck to the bottom of multiple plates. Hoping that this was just a rare to see, I would give the restaurant another chance, but if you see repeat trends in a new dining location in Vegas it makes you not want to risk getting sick at a new restaurant. Food/service was four stars compared to other locations, cleanliness was one star. Giving this location two stars overall."}
{"text":"At first I was excited to see a Cracker Barrel on our side of the country but after the food came, not so much. The portions are dinky and the sausage patties were overcooked. I took a picture for you."}
{"text":"My kids love this place with the outdoor checkers and rocking chairs, the country store with nostalgic candy and toys and the amazing pancakes and warm little bottles of syrup.  They are in heaven.  Excellent service on this busy Sunday afternoon. They serve more food than you can possibly eat. .or should eat."}
{"text":"Had a crapy server but food was good"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before.  Earlier this week, I met a couple friends for lunch, and they suggested said institution. What they hey, I figured, and down 74 I went.

When I arrived, I was somewhat surprised to find that one must walk through a strange little store to get to the dining room.  I say \"strange\" because I couldn't detect any kind of Cracker Barrel theme: it was a fairly random assortment of clothes, candles, food, and toys.  Do they really sell enough of this stuff to diners to make the venture worthwhile? Or perhaps some people, upon needing a new blouse or lavendar-scented candle, just stop by CB during their errands.

Anyways, I digress.  Once we were seated, service was attentive and very friendly.  It was the middle of the weak, so I behaved myself and got the grilled catfish platter with three veggie sides.  The veggies were all really good, actually, but the catfish itself was slightly oily and muddy-tasting, as inexpertly handled catfish tends to be.  I am sure that their specialties, however, are the mouth-watering meatloaves and casseroles that I saw others eating.  If I return, I will have to resign myself to the calories and try those.

Oh yeah, the server brings you your receipt, and then you take it into the store to pay.  The cashier will try to convince you to buy whatever knick knack they're pushing this month.  Be strong!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It all started with our online reservation that said we would be seated in 25 minutes. However when we arrived it still took additional 20 minutes to be seated. When we were taken back we were greeted by a very friendly waitress that was very attentive. She took our order right away and brought us our drinks very fast as well. 
When our food came out there were a few mistakes and an eyelash on one of our meals. They fixed it right away and apologized for this. We did appreciate that they apologized and fixed the order, but maybe a little more would have been better. 

I would typically have rated them 1 star for all the mistakes and the obvious eyelash on our meal, but because the waitress was very friendly and attentive they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"Where else to go when you're craving for some American comfort food?! I really wanted some meatloaf and came here assuming that they would have an awesome one! We waited in line to have our name called. It didn't take long for them to do so but they had seated two other parties that had came after us before they got to us. Note that those two parties also had two people. To my disappointment,  the meatloaf wasn't as good as I had picture it. I thought that it would come out with gravy or some sauce and the meat looked a bit too pink to my liking. In addition, I also didn't like the corn bread. On the bright side, I was pretty pleased that my meal came with three sides. The meals came out way too fast! My brother had ordered the campfire meal which looked delicious! I personally thought that it was ok. It was a bit too peppery and the waitress had not recommended the dish to an elderly woman sitting behind us. The waitress was nice and kept coming back to our table to make sure that we were doing ok. Overall, I thought that the place was ok as I like the atmosphere but the food wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Walked in and were greeted and told to grab menus and silverware and to seat ourselves. ( before 8 am there is no host on duty in this restaurant)
Ordered Old-timers breakfast. Two eggs, your choice, choice of bacon or sausage, grits, and all the fixins- biscuits and gravy. 
Service was timely, restaurant was clean, food was ok."}
{"text":"I was wondering why there weren't many lunch reviews... cuz they are just ok. 

I had a steak burger, cooked medium (blech) salad and beans. 

Salad, sad little boring salad with packaged Blue cheese, even though they serve blue cheese crumbles as a topping for the burger. 

Burger was fried, I would say well done but still juicy, no seasoning.

Beans were wonderful. 

Bisquit was good. 

All-in-all \"GO FIR BREAKFAST\". (you like my country slang?)"}
{"text":"First time coming to CRacker Barrel. Wow love the portions and how they give three sides. I love the hash brown casserole. The complementary corn bread muffin so good with butter and jam. The biscuit was all good but I prefer the corn bread. The services was on point. Lisa who helped us was so funny and friendly. I love a good waitress to make my dining great. Services is also important in eating out. And Lisa made it memorable. 

We ordered the Haddock, country fried steak which to me needed more gravy and they provided more, meatloaf, pork chop specials, prime rib, and fried shrimp with mac and cheese. Our sides where fried okra, Mac and cheese, dumplings, hash brown casserole, baked potato, broccoli, Brussels sprouts with kale salad (only thing that I didn't like), corn ( my daughter didn't like which is weird cause she loves corn.) and fries. 

Our dinner was amazing just a few sides we didn't like. But all the main dishes was excellent! I would definitely come back. I want to try the chicken pot pie (weds) and buttermilk fried chicken (Sunday). Which are on special days only!

Big parking lot. You may have to wait awhile if you plan on going on weekends. So either be put on the waitlist or come early. We went on a week night and it was not long of a wait they just had to set up a table and clean it."}
{"text":"High anticipation coming in based on the local hype! I arrived with a 30 minute wait....tons of people waiting... great sign I thought...  service was good... food was unfortunately very underwhelming!!!
I ordered a big spread... double meat egg breakfast with a side of hash browns. It came with biscuits and gravy on the side....

The rundown: 3 eggs... 1 cooked fine, the other two were on the raw runny side... a \"full order of bacon and sausage patties\".... in my mind I was thinking nice large lean bacon strips and full size sausage patties. NOT. The bacon was 75% fat... over cooked and was probably the 4 scronniest pieces I have ever had. The patties were 2\" round and 1/4\" thick. Really? 
The biscuits and gravy... really nothing to write about... the hash browns, were actually good!
Bookmark is gone on this one.... way too bad, was really hoping for home run in this one...."}
{"text":"This was the worse painless food we have ever had. Took a bite of each side and needed to leave. Manager did not care for our complaint. He just said well thanks for trying us. 
So rude and just disrespectful. Please take your money els where. 
Unless you would really like plain non flavor food with no one to care about what you have to say and wait about one hour. This is the place for you lol"}
{"text":"The worst thing about this inexplicably popular restaurant is the wait. Why were so many people clamoring to stuff themselves with bland, mushy, carb-laden food on a hot day?

But, one our friends REALLY wanted to go there, and she was willing to go early to put our name on the list, so off we went.
We did wait for a while, but we rocked in the chairs out front where it was shady and the time went pleasantly enough. Then, we were ushered in to be seated in the most crowded, noisy environment possible. They were cramming way too many people in too small of a space. Everyone was bumping the person behind them, the servers couldn't get between tables, and you had to take a scenic course to get to the restroom. etc. Hated it.

I vaguely remembered visiting a Cracker Barrel in AZ, and it being a pleasant experience. After my memory was refreshed by this visit, I remembered liking the cute store, the little peg games, and the hash brown casserole. Virtually everything else was an example of home cooking from someone who was not a very good cook.

The servers were pleasant enough, but they brought everyone's food at a different time; my sister's toast was cold and unbuttered, and they brought out rock hard butter LATER which could not be spread;my server asked which two sides I wanted with my sandwich then charge d me for both when it turned out there was only supposed to be one. (Her error- my penalty), etc.

 These were only a few of the gaffes- followed by another unpleasant experience while trying to pay the check. They force you to go stand in line in the gift shop so you might buy some extra crap, and the little old lady at the register bungled the simple operation of check splitting so badly that some people paid for things they didn't order, but wanted out so badly it wasn't worth it to try and correct it. 

Some of this could probably be attributed to a fairly recent opening, but there is nothing there that is good enough to warrant the trip, the wait, or the money. Some folks seem to think so but I bet I can guess who they're voting for for president, so disregard their opinion."}
{"text":"Overall love this place. My mom and I are regulars. Love the food especially the biscuits! We always get great service but the waiters/waitress. On the other hand, the hostess is rude. This is the second time she's been unfriendly, talks back, and just makes me uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Likely an ok place for breakfast and a couple weekly specials.

We made the mistake of going their for a corned beef dinner on St. Partick's day.   Not a good decision on my part.  The first time in my life I've seen or tasted corned beef slabs thrown on a greasy flat grill and burned like hash browns."}
{"text":"The Sunrise Sampler, no need to look anywhere else on the menu.

Two eggs, bacon, sausage, AND ham, hashbrown casserole, biscuits and gravy, grits, and fried apples. And it is only $7.99 for all that food. If you don't want one of the items, you can get more of another. I usually skip the grits and apples and go for double casserole and double biscuits and gravy.

It is seriously filling and completely tasty.

And healthy too! LOL."}
{"text":"Two words: Sunrise Sampler. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"Food was great....glad they came to Vegas.  Chicken and dumplings never disappoint and now I know the burgers are good too.  Try the Cole slaw yummy and pickles are dill which are my fav.  Big thumbs up worth the wait.....it's a new why wouldn't you expect the wait...duh"}
{"text":"This is my husbands favorite place to eat when we visit a city that has them.  He loved his meal he always gets the chicken and dumplings.  Unfortunately I ordered a grilled chicken salad and my chicken was raw. The waitress really didn't seem to think it was an issue.  No manager came over or anything.  Raw chicken is serious."}
{"text":"I was so excited about coming here. The store brought back memories of my childhood   They had soda in bottles and peanut candy. Super cool decorated also. Then we get seated for lunch. Our waitress was nice. The ambiance was also warm. Then I order the Wednesday special. Chicken pot pie, my absolute favorite. Well next thing you know our food came out and my chicken pot pie look dried out. Overly cooked and I tried to eat it. Super dry and the crust was like sand. Also I had to go and ask the manager for silverware. She looks over at my table and makes a joke.  Says today is eat with ur hands. Lol.  Ok no big deal. Then I had to ask another waitress to find my waitress. She finally came and I showed her my meal. She said oh that doesn't look good. I think it was the last one. I replied to her that it shouldn't of came out of the kitchen. The chef can obviously see its over cooked and shouldn't serve it. And she brought it out to me. She can see it's not edible. Anyways that was my experience"}
{"text":"Sunday morning, I decided to see what all the hoop-la was about and check out Cracker Barrel. I went on the web site to find out the address. While on the web site, I noticed a reservation link. I clicked on the link and made a reservation for 2. The web site stated that there was about a 40 minute wait.  It took me about 50 minutes to get to the restaurant. Once I arrived, I checked in with a man at the podium. He told me to wait in the store and my name will be called shortly. As soon as I entered into the store, I heard my name being called on the PA system.  After being seated, Joseph our server acknowledged us and said that he will be with us after he delivers the food for the neighboring table.  Several minutes later, Joseph welcomed us and went over the menu. I settled on the pork chops with eggs.  The price was very reasonable ($11.50) and my wife settles on the pancakes.  The food was delivered fairly quickly  Joseph checked back with us frequently and even the managers (2 of them) asked how things were. I asked for some coffee and the manager himself got it for me. The food was very good too. I didn't like the hash browns, and the server immediately replaced them with something else.  The food was so good that I even ordered stuff for take-out.  After we finished eating, I went into the store and bought some misc. food items.

I will definitely return here again. I strongly suggest that you use the web site reservation feature in order to eliminate or reduce your wait times."}
{"text":"I remember Cracker Barrel for having great home cooked food. Maybe it's what we ordered but it seemed like standard restaurant food. Great service!"}
{"text":"Ate there last week and the let some lady bring her poodle in. Not only that, the manager brought over a chair for the poodle to sit at the table. I like dogs but not at resteraunts sitting at chairs. The manager said she claimed it was a \"service animal\" and he wasn't allowed to ask for any documentation though. Nothing like the smell of dog crap and pancakes."}
{"text":"The wait was over an hour which was to be expected for the new location on a Sunday afternoon.  The entire staff was very friendly always asking if everything was okay ( a person every minute or less to be exact, that includes when you were eating or talking) this could be and was annoying at some point, being that you were not able to enjoy your food or company.   The food was okay and was not brought out all at once mostly due to the large number of people they were serving"}
{"text":"Grew up on Cracker Barrel that we drove to Utah when there wasn't one in Vegas, and now there's two here, and both are amazing! Sometimes the waits suck, and the stores are smaller than the other locations out of state, but the food remains the same. I love this place, and I usually get the plate that has eggs, hash browns, bacon, yogurt, and a muffin of my choice (Blueberry is the best). I love this place so much! Always will get my service."}
{"text":"How can you go wrong with Cracker Barrel -- I always go to these restaurants when I'm traveling or doing some sort of physical activity that requires some travel.  

Hands down some of the best pancakes I've had and that's saying a lot - wink!  I usually don't eat pancakes, but sometimes you just gotta carb load.  If I'm not mistaken they make and bottle their own maple syrup. Served warm this combination of the goowy sticky syrup and pancakes is music to my palate!

Along with pancakes I order their Eggs in a Hole - over easy of course.  Yummy ooze of egg yolk flows through my hash browns and the crispy bacon!  Mmmmm...I can't wait for the next trip.  Might just have to go somewhere so I can go to Cracker Barrel!  

Overall, the service here is always excellent.  The place is built like some old cabin with some Midwest flare -- We ain't in Kansas!?  They sell really random things in their store front from shirts, candles, stuffed animals and books....I get confused, but maybe I just need another cup of Joe. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We have becoming to this location for years and had never had a bad breakfast.  Great menu with a large selection of down home comfort foods.  Service at this location is usually very good, but can be slow when they get busy.  Food quality is consistent regardless of location.  Prices have recently gone up slightly, but you can beat it for the amount of food you receive.  There are reasonably priced Lunch and Dinner specials during the week.  The Country Store is a browsers paradise with unique seasonal and holiday themed items and other goodies.  Out front on the porch they have rocking chairs you can try (and buy) along with checkers for all to enjoy."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is very clean, well ran, good food and some very good employees.  The breakfast here is better than \"The Good Egg\" and also better then \"Denny's\" in my humble opinion.  

Some recommendations:  Moma's Pancake Breakfast ~ You get three buttermilk pancakes, two eggs cooked to order with your choice of any fruit topping or syrup. I usually go for the hot fried apples with an extra side of their maple syrup as a filler.  This is served with smoked sausage patties, turkey sausage patties or thick-sliced bacon.  This is a HUGE breakfast full of carb's so be prepared to walk it off afterwards!  

Another recommendation is their Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ~ You get two Eggs cooked to order with grits, gravy and buttermilk biscuits, oh ya, and get their  Apple Butter to go with the biscuits. It also comes with your choice of fried Apples or hashbrown casserole, go for the hashbrown casserole and their country fried steak.  This is enough food for two people!!  

Yes this is a chain, but this Crackle Barrel is worth it.  They are consistent  with their execution in preparing their breakfast dishes and their services is very good.  Maybe I will see you there!"}
{"text":"So I came here on opening day.....great idea right? Not really, but a friend wanted to go so we went! 

We were told it would be about a 2 hour wait and were seated in about an hour and half. They were turning tables pretty quickly. What else is there to expect going on opening day? Not to mention opening week. If you plan on coming, then expect a wait for the next week or two at least!! If you complain about the wait, you're a new kind of special. 

The place was packed to say the least, both the store and the restaurant. The seating area outside was pretty packed as well but as they turned tables it slowly got less and less packed. I think people came in waves lol 

After we were seated we were greeted by our waitress who had a member of the training staff with her (red shirt) and she took our drink order. It didn't take any longer than expected for the drinks to come out. We noted that the tables were cleaned up pretty quickly for another party to be seated. 

The service overall was pretty good, they had people coming around checking on tables to make sure the drinks were filled and what not. The assistant managers were checking on tables to make sure people were happy, etc. It's to be expected for opening day. They probably had double the staff on hand working and training. 

I ordered unsweetened ice tea which is pretty much the same where ever you go. The rest of our table had sweet tea, orange 'n cream, and apple cider. The drinks were all on point. I'm not a huge fan of apple cider because I can never find ones that I like, but their apple cider is on point! The sweet tea wasn't overly sweet, which was good for me but my friend likes it extra sweet so she dumped another two packs of sugar into it! 

Our table had Chicken and dumplings platter, rainbow trout dinner plate, and the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast. We all shared a bite to see what everything tasted. The difference between the platters and dinner plate is the size of the entree and an extra side. I got the rainbow trout  with corn and mashed potatoes. It wasn't anything special but good none the less. I just wanted something light and not heavy like the rest of the foods. I tried a bite of the buttermilk oven fried chicken breast and that was nice and moist. The Chicken and dumplings were on point as well. We didn't have anything bad but nothing was THAT great to me but nothing was bad either. 

This was the first time I've ever been to a Cracker Barrel restaurant and it wasn't a bad experience at all. I definitely want to try their breakfast and a few other items that caught my attention."}
{"text":"Came here a 2nd time and ordered the same thing as the last time lol (sampler). MUCH better the 2nd time around. Really love chicken and dumplings and it was 10x tastier and served at better temp."}
{"text":"I read some of the poor reviews about this location so not sure what to expect. We are visiting LV and went here for dinner.  We have eaten at dozens of CB across the country and this had the best service of any of those.   Food came within 5 minutes of ordering.  It was up to the CB standards as we have come to expect.   Waitress was very helpful and attentive.   Beautiful new building with somewhat different design than most.  We give this location high marks."}
{"text":"Finally, my dreams came true....made it to the famous Cracker Barrel but was saddened & not impressed. The food was good but not great like I imagined in my dreams. I would return to give it another try because I'm about second chances. They dis have a lot of cool things to buys in the store! OXOX"}
{"text":"I was a regular at this location for a few years and now that I'm no longer a local, I still stop in whenever I'm in town. I LOVE this place! Don't get me wrong... the food isn't fantastic. It's fattening and unhealthy and yummy. Their freshly brewed sweet-tea is tops and for a former south-easterner, coming here gives me a nostalgic warm fuzzy. This location has always been consistent for me in terms of quality and service. I like that. It isn't a 5-star (gourmet) restaurant by any stretch of the imagination but to me it deserves 5-stars. :)"}
{"text":"Super disappointed with our visit, service is good but the food was lacking. Ordered eggs over medium and got watery runny eggs the biscuit are hard and tasteless. So sad."}
{"text":"great place . good food. mac and cheese was ok. dumplins good. turkey good. service good"}
{"text":"So I've heard so many good things about this place and I know people stormed this location when it first opened up in Las Vegas. I always wanted to try it but we never had the time or the patience to wait in the crazy lines. 
Well we finally came to try the place and we were not disappointed! As you walk in there's a little shop with clothes, candies, old fashioned soda pops, little trinkets and a bunch of other stuff. I almost got too distracted and wanted to shop but hubby was too hungry to allow that. 
We were quickly seated and our server Suki was immediately there taking our drink orders. Now I know they're just drinks but the sweet tea and raspberry iced tea were both amazing. Not too sweet and still had the tea taste unlike other places. 
I ordered the spicy grilled catfish and hubby ordered the country fried shrimp. Each entree came with 3 sides so we ordered the \"dumplins\", hash brown casserole,  whole kernel corn, macaroni and cheese, sweet baby carrots, and homestyle fries. We were also served complimentary biscuits and corn muffins.

Biscuits were ok, a little dry but my puppy loved the leftovers. 

Corn muffins were not what we were expecting at all, they were quite tasteless and a little too \"cornmealy\". 

\"Dumplins\" were delicious and were served in a delicious gravy (I usually hate gravy so this is a pretty big deal).

Hash brown casserole was very good, too rich to finish but it was one of our favorites. 

Whole kernel corn was decent after we put some salt on it. 

Macaroni and cheese was very rich!

Homestyle fries- fries are fries lol

Sweet baby carrots were amazing. I told my husband the next time we go, I'm just going to order the carrots for my 3 sides. 

Country fried shrimp was great, they were served with tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. Very crispy and a good size as well. The hush puppies that were served with them were also very good. They were perfectly cooked.

The spicy grilled catfish was packed with flavor and grilled to perfection. It's easy to overcook fish but this was done perfectly!

Overall, 4/5 for the food! It's definitely a comfort food place. 5/5 for the service! Our waitress, Suki was super sweet and very helpful! We will be back!"}
{"text":"When I walked in, I felt like I've been here before. I never really paid attention to this before but they have a quite few locations in Arizona alone and they are everywhere in the United States. I must have went one of them somewhere in east coast.

Based on the decor of the restaurant, I wanted to eat biscuits and gravy with side of grits. I was on my way to some hiking, I wanted a lot of calories. 
Old timer's breakfast comes with biscuits and gravy (so many of them, couldn't finish what was served), small side of grits, (thinking how grits tasted as I write my review, now I remember last time/place I went to a Cracker Barrel. Interesting how food brings back memory), hash brown casserole, and sausage patties. It all tasted how the restaurant is decorated.

I also tasted fried Apple, it wasn't as sweet as I anticipated, just natural Apple sweetness, it would be perfect to use it for Apple pie. I ate two off my friend's plate but I actually wanted to eat all. Next time I will just order my own.

Service was good. She was very friendly and efficient. We were there at 7am on Sunday and they weren't busy but based on how restaurant was set up (chairs outside), I bet they get really busy during peak time. How efficient she was, she looked like she's been working there for a while. I didn't feel we were rushed, she was just good at what she was doing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing... Eggs and cheese to die for. Portions are pretty big good idea to get a couple of things and share. The service was good and the atmosphere was inviting. If your in the area I would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Momma's Pancake Breakfast was delicious. Highly recommended.  Also friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"it's cracker barrel, the usual... and as usual only a couple of dishes are good.  we ordered meat loaf, it was ok, the chicken & dumplings, good as usual, steak, ok, grilled chicken, don't order that, chicken tenders, pretty good. beef stew, gross and hot turkey sandwich, not great.  and my greens were so salty I could barely eat it!  too bad cause that's my favorite, so much so I ordered 2 and ended up leaving it barely touched!  boo! so if we ever go back, it will only be chicken dumplings & chicken fried steak. will not try anything else ever again :("}
{"text":"They wouldnt seat us until my buddy that was on  his way got here, I intentionaly arrived early to get a table because we where on a timeline that day.The staff was in a big hurry to get us out. It was busy I get it. The food was comparable to a Denny's restaurant. The waitress seemed annoyed with us for just being there, we didn't send anything back or complain so I'm sure what her problem was... that was the first and last visit for me."}
{"text":"Wow I am so disappointed...came in for a retirement party.. not sure if it was the cooks or what but the food was horrendous... everyone on the table had the same reaction... had the chicken and dumplings.. the dumplings we extremely doughy and tasteless ..couldn't even stomach them...someone in our party had the pecan fish and it was undercooked  so then they added the pecans is was like mush.... hamburger was really dry and tasteless... service was great but didn't come here for that.....this was disgusting.....if you want some good homestyle food please go elsewhere.....horrible and tasteless"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful delicious meal here with amazing staff that is friendly and delightful to speak with!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this establishment. Wtf is this?! This isn't a piece of trout...it's what trout shits out of it's rear end! Not only did the food look like a joke it is burnt and without flavor. This place is dirty and gross with food all over the floor and disgusting plating. The bathrooms are horrendously unkempt. Such a rip off!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious breakfast here! Prices were adequate (dinner is more expensive). The cute little store is nice as well!"}
{"text":"Great wholesome place  My family and I enjoyed our food and left with a big smile on our face ."}
{"text":"Gave a 4 only due to personal opinion. Food is always good quality so, taste fresh, comes out in time, and presented good enough for me. Service is always great there. The best server there is Brandon. Funny guy who never seems down and knows his stuff. you will never have to ask for a refill lol. The place itself is always clean warm and inviting. Even when they are slammed there service and food quality does not diminish."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! They had great food and our server was very attentive. This was my first time at a Cracker Barrel and I thought it was a pretty rad place. They even had a solid gluten free menu."}
{"text":"We have been to several Cracker Barrel's across the country.  We waited about 50 minutes for a party of 10 on Saturday morning 10 AM.  Lunch starts at 11 AM, but breakfast is served all day.  There were four mistakes with our order, but I will still give four stars because the value is that good.  Only paid $105 which includes tax and tip (6 adults and 4 kids) and we were stuffed!

Mistakes - gave us fries instead of mashed potatoes, forgot onions for a burger, forgot apples for a Sunrise sampler, and eggs were scrambled as usual instead of \"lightly\" scrambled as ordered.   As soon as we told the server, he brought out the needed items.  
Other service notes - brought 10 biscuits to start and they were gone in a flash (party of 10), then took about 15 minutes to bring more - our meals actually came out before the second round of biscuits; had to ask a couple of times for gravy

Food was delicious overall!  We will return."}
{"text":"I've always been partial towards greasy spoons. The wife calls it comfort food, I call it a good fkn meal. What do women know? Am I right or am I right. Nonetheless I've yet to have a bad meal at this place.
I highly recommend the meatloaf and the sirloin. The vegetables are awesome. Okra is good too, but it rips right thru me. Oh and a bonus...the servers have all of their teeth. That's all I got to say about that."}
{"text":"An elderly woman with a back hump in the handicapped spot and smoking a cigarette gave me the old stink eye...I did not feel welcome here. But the inside staff was inviting, warm, and friendly to the point my worries melted away.
Food is pretty good so I can't complain. I recommend the chicken-fried steak with biscuits and gravy. That'll put you in a nice coma for your afternoon nap. 4/5 would eat here again."}
{"text":"Well I've waited for this , and I must say I wasted my time!! Myself and my wife ordered the roast beef dinner, there was more fat than meat ( I told the waitress that I sure hope if someone else orders this meal that they have enough fat for them)  This place has gone downhill from what I have had in the past, I actually feel that the Cracker Barrel is going on their name because if they keep giving the type I meals we received they will not have the folks keep coming. I for for one have had it with this business, they willl not see me again."}
{"text":"Great experience and food all around.

The two hostesses were pleasant and quickly got us a table. 

Rachel was our server and was amazing. She had a fun vibe to her and she recommended the fried chicken special which most of us took. It was delicious just as she promised it would be. Constantly kept checking on our table and seeing if we needed anything or refills. 

Food: it was nice they were still offering breakfast menu at dinner as my Son was dying for some breakfast items. 

The young lady (Elizabeth?) who checked us out (food bill and a few store items we purchased) greeted us with a smile and treated us in a way that made you want to come back.

Overall great experience end-2-end."}
{"text":"Came in last night with my family and the only reason I gave one star was cause the food was delicious. Service and management were horrible. Sever never came back after she took our order and food runner refilled half our drinks. Had to ask a different server for our check just to watch our server dance on out and manager telling us they sent him home due to illness...first our server was a she and second if that was true what kind of illness? stupidity? then having to wait 15 min and being asked if we needed boxes 3 times for empty plates finally got the check without an apology. I hope I just came in on a bad day, but based on reviews I guess I'll just have to head to North Las Vegas for better luck."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned American greasy spoon food - comfort food galore.  The lines are crazy long - but we hit it on a Tuesday morning around 10AM and got seated quickly.  I don't know anything about grits - and I thought they were super bland.  Biscuits, hashbrowns, and bacon good.  Apples are yummy tastes like apple pie.  Service fine - it's a busy place, had low expectations.  Lots of unique stuff in the gift shop - wish the layout were easier for getting your name in for a table - people were so crowded up in the gift shop, hard to tell who was in line and who was shopping."}
{"text":"The food was alright. However, the pancakes were the only part of my food that was actually really really good! However, the service is not good! For a party of 3 I waited almost 1 hour and a half just to get seated, plus I waited 25-30 minutes to get my food which is ridiculous!! I got seated in a table that was dirty and had to ask someone to clean it. Also, there isn't much of a variety for pancakes or for breakfast plates. The waitress was not that friendly and would take 10 minutes every time we would ask her for something. I would have to keep telling her to refill the drinks because she wouldn't do it herself. I didn't have a good experience and will not be back! I rather go to iHop!"}
{"text":"Hospitality at its best, without fail! It has easily become an Arizona MUST-VISIT for our family each time we pass through. Each location uniforms the great customer service, personable and attentive staff, and the food is Southern Comfort without traveling too far South.  Portions are generous, and an obvious splurge in calories, but just enter knowing this and you'll more than enjoy the dining experience. They easily accommodated Denver omelette request even without it being in the menu.  They separated a pancake for my son from another adult breakfast portion without hesitation.  It is always a really pleasant and enjoyable dining experience.   Be prepared though, inevitably, we leave the gift shop entrance with a treat or two, too. Fun, nostalgic souvenirs, art, printables, from candles to Liniment. Yes, the old fashioned products from back in the day as my grandparents would say. The fun Easter items differed on this visit, in particular the huge array of jelly belly flavors to choose from. Definitely visit with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"This is only for the manager because our server Shontay was superb. We came in for dinner and the food wasn't even Cracker Barrel quality it was cold but after a 8 hour drive we just ate it. I ordered a peach cobbler to go which was literally 4 peaches and a dime sized piece of crust. My husband went inside to ask a cashier was this a normal serving size and the cashier directed him to the manager. My husband asked the manager the same question and he said yes before my husband could get the question out then quickly turned away as if my husband was bothering him and was not the least bit apologetic. How rude! Then my husband requested to speak with the manager again because he didn't get the chance to really speak with him regarding the serving size of the peach cobbler. Needless to say the at that particular location the serving size for peach cobbler is barely enough for a toddler, which cost $4. This is more than likely the reason this locations food is less than edible because the staff has to work with such a sour apple for a boss. I can't imagine if he treats paying customers this way how is he treating his staff? So whoever you are Mr. Manager please take off your moon shoes and astronaut costume come back down to earth!"}
{"text":"I love going to this Cracker Barrel! The service is so wonderful and the food reminds me of back home in Arkansas. The people that work there are friendly and are easy to talk to!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Cracker Barrel anywhere, walking in the door and the first thing we see is a bunch of \"stuff\" for sale, we came to eat not shop, we were seated very quickly, but that's where quickly stopped, servers walking by nobody even stopping to say they would be right back, a nice lady walked up and said ,, you haven't been helped ? we said no and she just walked a way and still , no one came to the table, after stopping a server and she said oh, I can take your order, we ordered and when it got to the table we had been there 40 min sitting at the table so we were ready to eat and get on the road, my French toast wasn't cooked all the way and was soggy in the middle and 4 slices for $7.95 and $4.00 for a side of 4 flattened, thin and cold bacon was not worth $12.00, my partner said of all things, his eggs were cold and the sorry excuse for hash browns were also cold, we couldn't get the servers eye and then wondered how we were going to pay and that's when we found the bill tucked under some napkins, it was time to leave and GUESS WHAT ??, another chance to buy more stuff !! , never again, they all cant be this bad , but I wont take the chance."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine at. Great food selection and reasonable prices. I feel I'm in the country."}
{"text":"The good was good, hey, it's cracker barrel. The service was outstanding, ask for Garrett W. You will be impressed. Great service, courteous and well spoken. Makes any meal a pleasure"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast today not our first time at cracker barrell but at this one. Special was cinnamon roll french toast with 2 eggs bisquit and bacon. 7.99. It was delicious. And portions. Beat any buffett we are stuffed. Server Holly was on the ball with anything we needed and friendly. We are from california so we appreciated the excellent service which is getting more rare. Always good food. My only critic is the food could have been warmer. Now to shop at the store."}
{"text":"Great food!! Service was okay..my wife and I ordered grandpas fried steak, My daughter ordered kids Mac and cheese, and my son ordered country boy medium steak. Waited about 20 mins.. not bad on a busy Monday 11am. My son asked for medium steak( steak with pink in the middle) in case people don't know... lol anyways he got WELL DONE!! not good .. about 20 min in my raspberry ice tea was gone and I didn't think about a refill until our server refilled another table BEFORE it was gone and they came after us!!. If it was not for the manager at the end this might of been 1 stared! We will give it a second shot for Lunch or dinner .. hopefully it turns out better."}
{"text":"Good Ole Cracker Barrel. What I like most about Cracker Barrel is their quick seating. We never have to wait more than 10 minutes. Either we visit at a good time (breakfast), or they are excellent about quickly seating guests and getting their food out to them fast so they can get up. 

Our recent visit was like the others. We spent just enough time in the country store to look around and contemplate buying a few nick nacks. Next thing we knew, they called us to be seated. Just my husband and I, we sat at a small table in the center of the dining room near the fire burning fireplace. 

We made small talk for a minute; then we were greeted by our waitress. We ordered our drinks, two lemonades. We quickly received them and instantly regretted it. The lemon water was not sweet or refreshing at all. Such a disappointment. I had to add a few packets of sugar to get the tart of the concentrated lemon mixture taste out of my mouth. 

We ordered simple dishes. I ordered two eggs over medium, some biscuits and a small cup of grits. My husband orders the same except with scrambled eggs and meat. The only disappointment with our meal was the grit soup that was served. I have never had such watery grits in my life. It was soup. I tried to finish them and couldn't. 

I am not a complainer and know that some restaurants have their good and bad days. I'm hoping this was just a bad day. I have been to this location before. However, I do not remember the grits, nor the lemonade being so distasteful. I have not knocked Cracker Barrel off my breakfast list just yet, but I do hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"We woke up this morning in the mood for breakfast out, and what better choice than a Cracker Barrel, right?
Not the case today. I'm not sure what it was, but from the waitress to the orders - (did not come out as ordered) to pouring coffee on our table twice when filling coffee (we had a toddler at our table, maybe this was making her nervous). My daughter asked if her eggs could be made two different ways (it said how you want them) and the face she was given said a thousand words. 

My daughter also ordered Apple juice and her cup was empty so she ordered another one. The waitress said \"there's no refills\" and my daughter said \"I know but I would like another one\" - to which the waitress said \"I'll bring you fifteen of them if you want to pay for them, is that what you want?\" Kind of rude, maybe she didn't sleep well the night before. 

And the gravy was tasteless today which didn't bode well for biscuits and gravy for breakfast. The kids ordered the double meat and the sausage patties were pink inside and tasted off. Even the grits were bland today. 

For 35 dollars for three people I would have preferred someplace else. Funny part is when our bill came she put a smiley face after her name."}
{"text":"Ok, this is a second consecutive back to back time that me and my family has come to eat here and they messed up my families order. It's not the server, but it's the kitchen that messed up and can't read a simple ticket. I called a manager over, whom happen to be the same manager as last time that came to us, Dave because we had been waiting for 30 mins without everyone having been served so we could eat as a family together. Well my father finally got his food and everyone else was cold obviously because it sat. I asked Dave point blank if he would take care of the bill and his exact words were \"I will pick up all the gaps\" and I said again to reconfirm you are going to comp the whole ticket so I know we are both on the same page? He said yes. So I told my parents don't worry about anything; it's been resolved. We got excited because last incident was maybe 3 weeks ago (last visit) and we waited for just shy of 40 mins for our food and this guy did not even have to guts to take care of the customers. So, I paid the bill and put it behind me. Well this time it happened again and I lost it. To fast forward everything... This Dave has the audacity to bring my family a bill, taking off the food for my father and that's all. What about the rest of the family that had to wait 30 mins to eat since we only eat as a family, not individuals??? If you are going to comp one person, you better comp my whole family because your stores mistake cost our whole families time to eat, not only once, but twice in a row. 

So, as a conclusion, I gave this Dave manager several opportunities to fix this issue and his way of fixing it was very very unethical. So I will keep this post up until someone from this organization decides to message me to put a solution together. The customer service from Dave was very very very unprofessional. If I come across abrasive or aggressive, don't get butt hurt, it's whom I am.... a retired Marine Corp combat Gunnery Sergeant with 20yrs of military service. I don't handle stupidity or unethical people well!

{"text":"I'm honestly ashamed to say that this past Saturday was my first experience at Cracker Barrel. 

Bobby & I take my grandma to dinner every year for her birthday. Since we live about 45 minutes away and we all have crazy work schedules, it's hard for us to get together. I decided on cracker barrel this year because I knew she enjoyed it (& I've never been there!! lol)

I ordered the sampler which comes with a slice of meatloaf, chicken & dumplings plus a slice of ham. You get to choose 3 (!!) sides.. how awesome! I chose the hashbrown casserole, country green beans & side salad. I am so thankful that I chose the hashbrown casserole- it was amaze! All of my meal was delicious.

Our server was actually new, but we couldn't tell. The only way were figured this out was by asking what the stars on their apron represented. 

I honestly cannot wait to go back to Cracker Barrel!!!"}
{"text":"Marie is awesome! On top of everything! Great food, great service! Come see Marie and she will take great care of you!"}
{"text":"So against better judgement we decided to go back and try breakfast.  Our server Jason, super friendly and knowledgeable....food was better but no different then an IHOP or Dennys.  Experience was  better then the first time only thing they really need to work on is it took an hour to get our food again."}
{"text":"Come in here quite a bit by myself, usually later in the evenings. Service is usually slow and the wait staff seems to be inconvenienced when you show up during their closing hour and more concerned about leaving work than giving proper service. *News flash wait staff* better service=bigger tip. Keep coming for the consistent food. (Which is ok at best) better service in the mornings as long as you beat the rush, good luck with that."}
{"text":"I came with high hopes but service was very slow . We got our meals after other ppl that had been seated after us .  Grits were slimy .  Biscuits were good . Gravy for the biscuits was very floury and tasteless.  Overall a very bad experience.  Even trying to pay the bill was a nightmare because there was 1 cashier and 20 unhappy ppl trying to get out of there"}
{"text":"This was absolutely amazing!!!   The portions were huge, the food tasty & the service was fast!!! 
I love the check in on line process so we didnt have to wait too long."}
{"text":"We expected more!  Overall impression....food was over processed and bland.  The coffee was weak...waitress suggested a double brew.  We had a simple breakfast...scrambled eggs with ham, bacon, sausage, country gravy, eggs over easy with chicken fried steak.  Everything but the service was just meh!  The biscuits were bland, the gravy like glue, the chicken fried steak was boring...oh and the grits had no taste whatsoever.  The waitress was great, the manager offered us another dish...but how can you fix BLAND!  

Really, I think it comes down to Corporate cost cutting on quality and the public just getting used to sub par food that when graded on a curve rises to the top!"}
{"text":"As always, this is a Cracker Barrel. It is homey, delicious and comfortable. You do not come here for gourmet, you come here for comfort food.

I am always happy with their bottomless coffee and affordable prices. Our waitress was friendly and efficient. When my husband found a hair in his food she promptly took it away, comped his meal and brought him a new breakfast."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, reviewed a few of them already. Always 5 star comfort food for me. They have great breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love the store while you wait or after you eat the fireplace, and the nostalgic décor. Always nice dining experience when you hit up a Cracker Barrel.
Always get a desert if you aren't at breakfast and get some Buckeye candy from the store!"}
{"text":"We have been going to this Cracker Barrel for a year and a half, since we moved here and it progressively gets worse. The last four times the biscuits were so hard they could be used as hockey pucks. The kitchen help and the waitresses have to know that the biscuits are no longer fresh and need to be thrown away. The gravy was the consistancy of mached potatoes and the hasbrown casserole was dried out  beyond salvation. If the management doesn't open there eyes this place will soon be a ghost town. I will wait several weeks and see if they read this and make the necessary changes, if not, my money spends elsewhere."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and dumplings with sides of green beans and lima beans. We're from Oregon and don't have this chain so I was excited to see what it was all about. The chicken was dry and lacked flavor but the dumplings were the worst. They were bland thin chewy squares of flour with water that appeared to have no levening or salt. The green beans weren't the worst. However the lima beans were outstanding. The service was good and the place was clean and pleasant."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and good food.we tried fried cat fish i went just basic salad and huge sweet potatoes for $6.my other friend ordered strawberry green salad no complaints.service was good and for few minutes we thought we are at greek restaurant.2 glasses shattered.there is also store."}
{"text":"Tried Cracker Barrel for the first time. Overall the service was great and the server was on top of our visit. 
The food was okay, it didn't live up to all the hype. I had the ham n' maple bacon bowl. It's flavor was unbalanced. It was sweet and salty. The biscuit was warm and super soft. The pancakes were crunchy, and you could taste the oil/butter used to cook the pancakes. It was like butter on butter. I liked the the little individual syrup bottles made for everyone to use.
My iced coffee was bland, as if I had gone to McDonald's for a iced mocha."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of the lunch and dinner menu at Cracker Barrel aside from a couple of their salads which come with those yummy little CB cheese wedges. I am a fan of their breakfast menu and luckily they serve breakfast all day, so I can have pancakes and hash brown casserole for dinner if that's what I'm feeling like. Parking is a bit odd at this location, but there's plenty of it and naturally they have all that pricey wicker on the front porch that you'll probably walk by on your way inside. Like most Cracker Barrel's, you enter in the gift shop area and wait to be seated. The gift shop has old time candies, country style home decor and other novelty items. The servers have been nice and attentive and the cashiers in the gift shop have been friendly and good about moving the long along quickly (you pay your bill in the gift shop).

Coffee ($2.39 free refills) - Simple cup of coffee that's tasty and there's usually someone walking around with a tray of coffee and water topping off cups. 

Sunrise Sampler ($10.68 with the addition of cheese on the scrambled eggs) - Two eggs cooked to order, biscuits and gravy, grits, fried apples, hash brown casserole, sausage, bacon and country ham. Phew! Yep, the sampler comes with all that! This is my favorite thing to order. They give you a choice between 2 types of ham and I always choose the sugar ham, it's delicious. Their bacon is tasty, but I don't personally care for sausage patties and that's what comes with this, so it goes to my hubby who happily eats it. One thing on the menu I have to order every time is their hash brown casserole, it's just very good and sometimes I order an extra side of it because I have no shame and it's damn good. You can also request apple butter for your biscuits with this breakfast at no additional charge. 

Momma's French Toast Breakfast ($9.19) - This comes with four slices of sourdough french toast with choice of fruit topping and your choice of either sausage or bacon. I love that this french toast is a different from the usual since it's made with sourdough bread. The slices were fluffy and a different texture than I am used to with french toast, but it was delicious and I'd order them again. I asked for apples as my fruit option because I know they use their fried apples and I love those. The syrup is 100% maple and very tasty! Even though the menu says you choose from fruit topping or syrup, you can still ask for both and get charged the same. The syrup comes in cute little Cracker Barrel glass jars. 

Speaking of the Cracker Barrel 100% maple syrup, you can buy a regular size bottle (current price $4.99) in the gift shop. I stopped by just before Christmas to pick up some of their pancake mix and syrup and both were sold out. Around the holidays those couple of items can be hard to find, but are usually regularly stocked and I did find some with no problem after Christmas."}
{"text":"I love having a Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas! The only bad thing was the hour wait, but that's expected with it being brand new. Rachael was my server and she was fantastic! She went above and beyond and I will absolutely be requesting her when we come back! She made us feel welcome and immediately had us planning to come back. Can't wait for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Simply a horrible experience, service was a joke and as slow as waiting for the winning lottery ticket. Our waitress Risa was the worst I have ever come across. Totally clueless and messed our order up 3 times   if I could give lower than a one star I would   food was cold and incorrect, manager was a very slight upgrade in service after we complained about her. They simply don't care   Vegas is built on customer service. These mutts obviously never read the manual   it's so sad"}
{"text":"I love stopping at these locations they have that homie fell to eat and there food tastes like food you eat at home the staff was friendly and the food was delicious prices are very reasonable"}
{"text":"Haven't had this place in a while and I don't know why! The food was great, love the shopping you can do before you get your table or after while your paying the bill. Our server Brandi was great, helped us out with having 2 new blend with us, generous portions of food too! Had their signature chicken fried steAk and it was really good. Will have to come back to try their breakfast soon."}
{"text":"Service is a hit or miss at this place. Food is decent but they price more for anything you want to trade out. I tried switching out my meat for a veggie option and was going to be charged 2 dollars for it. Just trying to be a tad healthy. It gets really busy on Saturdays so expect some waiting and possible messed up orders! Patience is key here down in the south ;P"}
{"text":"Anyone who is rating this store a 1 or a 2 is ridiculous. It is a great place to eat and the service is great. If you really like southern style food, I would suggest the Catfish. Perfect combo of soft in the center and crisp on the outside. The pricing with this store is comparative to Denny's and is way better service wise and taste wise. Sometimes people go on breaks, sometimes service falls through the cracks, but if you go here often like I do, you know that the customer is a priority, and the food is great with large portions."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Cracker Barrel... thought they were all on the east coast. Well it was a mistake bringing them west!  Everything about this place was wrong. No one greeted me, and the hostess looked at me like she wished I would drop dead. Didn't say a word. This was already 100% different from any Cracker Barrel back east, where they are extremely hospitable.  Someone else came up to me in a few minutes and took me to a table.   There was silverware, but no napkins. ??  The waitress turned out to be cheerful if not very competent... she got my order wrong.  I've gotten the same breakfast probably 40 times and again ordered the same thing, but it was far from the usual. The ham was dry, the eggs overcooked, and the hash brown casserole was so raw the potatoes were crunchy.   When the manager came by and asked me how  everything was, I pointed out to him that the hash browns were cold and extremely undercooked, and he said Oh, I'll tell the kitchen.  He did not walk to the kitchen, did not offer to get me some cooked food... just ridiculously bad service.  Looks like they get their biscuits from food service and heat them up, actually I doubt much cooking goes on in this kitchen. They were cold and stale.  I would not eat here again if it was free.  Y'all need to go eat in Cracker Barrel in North Carolina and see how it's supposed to be done.  Shame on you."}

I've been to other Cracker Barrels but none compared to this little Arizona place. YUM!"}
{"text":"Cafeteria style food.  The best way to describe the food is old fashion versus rustic or homestyle.  I imagine they just go into the kitchen and scoop the food from a buffet line.  That being said, not amazing quality food but it was decent.  The roast beef was tender and fairly tasty.  My sides were carrots (over cooked), mashed potatoes w/ gravy (lukewarm), and mac n cheese (best item on the plate).  It was perfectly cheesy and gooey without being mushy.

I was not a fan of walking through the gift shop to get to the restaurant and then again walking into the gift shop to pay.  There are too many temptations (candy galore) while waiting in line."}
{"text":"We went to Vegas and saw the Cracker Barrel.  We have one at home and decided to try it.  Glad we did!  Our server Mandy was excellent and the food was really good."}
{"text":"We'd give a zero if possibke.  Horrible food. wouldn't call this country food...worse food ever!  And we wsited 45 minutes! We ordered chicken n dumplings..twhat a joke...the dumplings were flat chunks of flour not fluffy at all...like flat white cow patties.  The sauce was flavorless and seemed to be made w corn syrup.  I had chicken fried chicken w white gravy..call us crazy but when you order chicken you expect chicken gravy...not pork!! So we scraped it off both our chicken and mashed potatoes.  The bisquits were NOT light or fluffy..they were heavy, doughy and so salty it was like eating baking soda.  Ugh. The  rice pilaf was ok nothing special and under cooked. Baked sweet potato had to be the smallest thing I ever saw and not even hot.  The ranch dressing was artificial tasting. All in all terrible food..like bad chain  restaurant food.  Pretty disappointing. Won't be back.  Lucilles bbq is much better.  Save your money. It was busy but must be tourists or newbies that don't know better.  Btw mgr knew and could've cared less."}
{"text":"I'm mainly writing this review to talk about our server. Don't get me wrong. The biscuits and gravy was amazing and so was the hash brown casserole...but our server, Diana, was AMAZING! She was so sweet and attentive. I really love going to a new place and having an all around awesome experience. My mom and I definitely did! 
Thanks, Diana, for being so awesome :)"}

{"text":"We walked in right before they closed and they still made us dinner to go. They couldn't have been nicer. Everyone working here was beyond pleasant and helpful. And the fabulous candy selection! Thank you for making a couple of cranky travelers whose flight was cancelled, feel the love."}
{"text":"I have GOT to stop judging places by the fact that they are a chain.  I have never been here on my numerous trips to Mesa and to Riverview Shopping Center because I assumed I wouldn't like it.  But I've been craving Chicken and Dumplings lately and found out they had it so I decided to try them out.  

First, the service was cheerful and attentive without hovering.

Second, the price was right: $7.99 with two sides, a corn muffin and a biscuit.  The amount of food was about perfect, maybe a bit more than I needed but not quite enough to justify a to go box.

If the chicken had been any more tender I wouldn't have been able to discern it from the noodles.  The dumplings were the thick noodle style, not like my mother's which were balls of biscuit dough dropped into boiling broth, but they tasted good so that was ok.

The green beans were as good as any my mother made, mushy Indiana style with lots of bacon flavor.  Mmmm.

The baked sweet potato was very mushy with a perfectly edible skin.  I ate every bite even though I was expecting it to be the texture of a regular baked potato.  

I'm not a big cornbread fan but theirs was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with good flavor.  I like that they give you one smaller corn muffin and one smaller biscuit for variety.

I've lost count of the number of times I've eaten a biscuit that has sat around too long, or the dough has, and it tastes fermented/moldy, like beans or split pea soup that has sat out too long.  This one was super fresh and had great texture and flavor.  

So the entire meal was a success! St. Patrick's Day is later in the week so I'll have to come back abd try their Corned Beef and Cabbage Special for $8.99."}
{"text":"It's cracker barrel... it will be just like any other cracker barrel you've been too. Big country breakfasts, down home cooking, you know the drill. It's not fancy but its dependable."}
{"text":"I wonder why nearly every trip out of the state always involves a trip to a Cracker Barrel. Oh wait it's because they're so good. I could actually end my review just there but I guess the reader deserves a little more. I feel the can't miss item is always the apple butter. The biscuits are also always delicious. The staff are always very friendly and take great care of you. I've always heard the wait can be very long but strangely every time we go just by circumstance we always show up really early around 6:30 am. I guess wherever we go to next I'll have to make sure there's a Cracker Barrel open nice and early."}
{"text":"We got there, they said it would be 1 hr wait.  It really didn't seem like it was even that many people there for 1 hr wait.  But it's cool we stuck it out, and it only took 20 min.  Service was good, waitress was on point.  But they sat us under the ceiling fan, and it was so cold.   I was trying to hurry up and eat so I can get back outside to the 100 deg weather.  I got the fried cat fish.  It was good, next time I will have them fry it a little longer, or make it extra crispy.  It 's a good place to go when I don't want to cook it at home, and it's a lot closer than the other place we go to.  My sides were pretty good, specially the brussel sprout mix I had with the cranberry's in it, and it was sweet.  Next time I will pass on the mac n cheese.  I also took a bite of my husbands meatloaf.  I've had better, it just tasted like a blob of ground beef to me.   But he liked it.  
I think next time I will stick with the breakfast.  There breakfast is amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here at 7:30 on a Sunday morning. No crowd, sat right down. Service was good, but the food was not. Eggs and bacon were obviously being cooked in large batches, then just plated as necessary. All of our scrambled eggs came out cold, and the bacon was pink and rubbery. After sending it back, the manager returned with made to order eggs and some of the same pink, rubbery bacon that had been heated up.

Ridiculous that they can't get breakfast right on a Sunday morning when the place is half empty."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cracker Barrel? If you're returning home to CA on I-10, this particular location on the Western edge of Phoenix is THE last Cracker Barrel.

We couldn't continue on to CA without stopping at Cracker Barrel just one last time, so we exited the freeway here for dinner. The weather was weird that day. It was 115 degrees and hot as hell, but there was also a big thunderstorm brewing. We couldn't leave our dogs in the car because of the heat, and we didn't think it would be a good idea to start driving into the storm while trying to eat at the same time. So we ate in the car, in the parking lot outside CB.

The food was great as always. I made the mistake of ordering all the food but forgot to order the drinks. So when I went back inside a second time to order drinks only, I guess the staff didn't want to create another ticket and they gave me the drinks for free - cool!

We'll definitely return to this location next time we're road-tripping."}
{"text":"I would like to thank our server Jason for providing such a favorable and memorable experience this morning at one of our favorite spots to eat. He made us fell like royalty !Cracker Barrell please have all your server take a page from this guys play book. If you stop by this location ask for Jason!!!"}
{"text":"As we travel, Cracker Barrel is one of our \"go to\" places to stop at. We know the menu, it's reliable, and my wife loves to shop and look at all the cool merchandise in the store.

We were in Charlotte for a wedding and had a great lunch on Saturday, 08/25/12. It was just enough to take the \"edge\" off before we headed to the wedding. Service was prompt and the food was good!"}
{"text":"We haven't even eaten yet today, but the gentleman who took our order is awesome!!!  Kanai is witty and efficient in spite of the fact that this place is mobbed on the last Friday before Christmas."}
{"text":"Great good. Fast seating. Amazing service. Very friendly. Never overly busy!! Love it!"}
{"text":"The best part of our visit was the 'country store' with cute knick knacks and a mixture of different sodas. We also really liked the warm syrup for pancakes in the little bottles. 
I ordered the Old Timers Breakfast and my partner got the pancake special. The meal overall was mediocre. Grits couldn't be substituted because they're \"complimentary\" but honestly they could have kept them. They were terrible. Our server never came to check on us after we had received our food so we had to wave down other random people for napkins, hot sauce, and extra syrup. The next time we saw our server, she was delivering a to go box--which we didn't ask for--and our bill! We felt rushed and unimportant."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cracker Barrel. I have been to different ones and this is by far the worst service I've had. My server needed re-training. 
Came here on a Friday late afternoon, no line, not busy. Host greeted us and sat us fairly quickly. Server came around and took our drink/food orders. I chose a dinner plate (choice of 3 sides). Took ~10 minutes for the server to come back with 2 drinks- no bread. ~10 minted later our food arrives by a different server. Missing one side, figured out server would be bringing it, since she was our server. Our server is nowhere to be found. Halfway through our meal, server checks on us. I politely ask her if I ordered a third side, since my meal comes with 3 sides. She said she doesn't have it written down but she's sure I did. Brings my third side and bread, midway through my meal. A couple minutes later brings the check, say \"I'm just going to leave this here\" and places it on the table. Didn't ask if we wanted anything else or dessert- and I'm midway through my meal . Didn't check on us at the end of the meal, to see if we needed boxes for our leftovers. Server is (again) nowhere to be found. Someone needs to re-train this server..."}
{"text":"This is the third time we've been here since it opened in Summer. Food is great but the wait is sooooooo long. Then you have to wait long again for the food you've ordered. The restaurant is always packed. It usually is a 35-45 minute wait to get a table and about 20-30 minute long to wait for your food."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Cracker Barrel for years and this is the first time we had bad service. Billy our server right from the start seem confused and distracted. Our cornbread was not promptly brought out. We had to continuously ask for refills. I ordered the pot roast dinner which came with 3 sides. The sides I ordered were corn, fried okra and sweet potato. they brought everything all out except the sweet potato. I had to ask where was it. Billy then just replied oh we are out of that, \"what else do you want\" without an apology. Why did he not come forward right away to let me know? I am highly disappointed."}
{"text":"A little gimmicky but overall I just love the wait staff. In every Cracker Barrel, I have never once had bad wait staff. Food is super inexpensive but I would REALLY love to see some healthy options involved."}
{"text":"My first time here, been hearing a lot of great things about this place and my BF's daughter wanted to go since she went last year. The place was packed but of course it was a Sunday around 100pm. So waited for about 25 min for our table which you really don't mind because they have a store that you can shop till your hearts content. They have a row of rocking chairs in the front of the restaurant so you can also just relax if you want about (20) to choose from, food was ok it's just seemed like an overpriced Denny's but your there for the ambiance and experience, in the shops they have giant dumdums to bottled root beer definitely a plus. Don't have them in Ca so experienced it and that's enough for me"}
{"text":"I love eating breakfast here, me and my hubby always leave satisfied.  The food is great and the prices are reasonable.  You got to come and try it if you never ate here."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable dinner. No wait to be seated when we walked in. I had breakfast for dinner, french toast breakfast, and the rest of my clan had dinner plates, all very tasty! Campfire chicken was amazing! The hostess Katelyn and waitress Jasett were both extremely friendly and efficient. We tried three desserts; the hot fudge mug sundae, the multi-berry cobbler, and the double chocolate fudge Coca-Cola cake! Sooo good, there were no leftovers.  Love browsing in the old store, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I have to give 3 stars because there was a hair on one of the plates. The manager came out and apologized and gave us the meal free. We waited about 40 minutes for our food so that was annoying."}
{"text":"Ok. I love their menu because this is the type of food I grew up eating. That being said if you don't cook it right it doesn't matter. Been to many other Cracker Barrel's and never have been so disappointed. Over easy eggs that were very obviously almost over hard. The biscuits were almost still just doe. Nothing special about their bacon other than it was hardly cooked. Over priced and basically an embarrassment to southerners."}
{"text":"If you have been to one Cracker Barrel, you've basically seen and tasted all that they have to offer.  The main difference seems to be between the level of service that is provided.

We visited this location early, at about 6:45.  They had just opened at 6 and there were only two other tables in the whole restaurant.  We were greeted promptly and orders taken.  The food also came out fairly quickly.  However, my husband asked for hot sauce and it took until he was almost done with his meal before the waitress was back with it.  It is nice to not have a waitress hovering over you, but at the same time, it would have been nice for her to check in, especially for things like the hot sauce and drink refills.  It wasn't like she had a ton of tables to attend to, so we don't know why she disappeared for so long.  On the plus side, she did give me a diet pepsi in a to go cup which was nice for the car trip home.

As always, the country store was filled with an eclectic mix of items, surprisingly including many cute tops.  It is a great place to pick up unique gifts or add ons to other gifts."}
{"text":"I've only ever been for breakfast and their hash brown casserole is worth the trip in and of itself. Wow. We are pretty boring here but they do fantastic French toast, buttermilk pancakes, and biscuits and gravy. I find if you stick to their basic menu, you won't go wrong! I find that when I try one of the seasonal specials is when I'm most disappointed. Breakfast can get pretty crowded on the weekends but they get you seated pretty quickly."}
{"text":"This particular Cracker Barrel in Mesa is where I have had the worst dining experience of my life. My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends. We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant. I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone? Our table was moved because oops! No one's working that section of the restaurant. 

It took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said \"Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on.\" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already. 

By the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our \"actual\" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job. 

Too long, didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken, you should consider leaving before you even start. I recommend Logan's Roadhouse."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel = Southern staple, right? I'm pretty sure I heard Oprah say that once. 

Part country store-part restaurant, they definitely have cool things to buy. Or, rather, stuff that you would get, say, in a magazine that you would order around Christmastime or if some kid was selling stuff for school.

They sell rocking chairs for about 130 bucks apiece. But, they're really well-made, and if I had enough room in my car, I would have bought one and taken it home. 

I don't usually tell my server that I don't eat meat when I go out. During this visit to Cracker Barrel, however, my friend blurted it out when I was trying to decide between salad and pancakes. In light of this, my waitress was extremely helpful in trying to find me a dish to eat that would be satisfying enough to keep me full for the 5.5 hour drive home. She even went as far as taking my menu and drawing stars next to all the items I could eat. Totally unnecessary, but really sweet. 

Hashbrown casserole + homemade biscuits = heavenly deliciousness. And, affordable too!!!"}
{"text":"If you want classy, upscale food, don't go here.  If you want a well cooked steak, don't go here.  If you want hearty, basic traditional American food with a Country slant and low prices come here.  I really like that they now have health conscious menu selections.  Food is diner quality, portions are good, but not overwhelming.  Service was ok and timely.  The gift shop is great if you like country stuff.  Interesting that the clothing selections are mainly for women and children.  For what it advertises itself to be, it does a great job."}
{"text":"+I wanted to see what all the fuss was about Cracker Barrel since people seemed to be rather happy over one opening in LA.
+Only thing I really knew of CB was Chris Rock's Mom claiming they were racist, which seems like a joke in itself with Cracker in the name of the place.
+You pretty much start off by walking into a gift shop.
+Basically, it's a General Store and the type of merchandise is what you would expect from one. Candy, knick knacks, cooking items...
+I didn't know what to expect from the menu. It's all Southern Home Cookin' style.
+I had the Fried Chicken Special.
+It was okay. Sort of in-between what you would get from a super market and The Plaza Inn at Disneyland.
+There was a creepy picture of some woman from like the early 1900's positioned over our table.
+Our server, Deana M. was awesome. Great personality and attentive. Five stars for her! Three stars for the food. Averages out to four stars."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Cracker Barrel. It's not healthy by any means, but that's not why you come here. 

The clientele was friendly. Granted, my wife and I were the youngest people there by about 40 years. 

The food was great and the staff was friendly. It's just some good comfort food and you just need that every once in a while."}
{"text":"Always a good time and great service at this Cracker Barrel location. The staff is very friendly and food is delicious. My favorite breakfast is the sunrise sampler. Lots of good food for a great value. I also love the county store and especially the end of season clearance finds."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  It's located off the 202 Loop near the Bass Pro Shops.

I'm a west coast girl so I've never heard of this place before until I saw it on my way to Home Depot that is in the same area.  I had asked a friend about it and he swore it had the best breakfast he's ever had.  Clearly he's never been to Black Bear Diner!

Went on a Sunday...biiiig mistake.  As we were waiting to be seated, my friend and I realized we weren't the following...

a) religious enough (it was Sunday, so I'll cut some slack on that)
b) old enough
c) tacky enough
d) cranky enough

My eyes.  OMYEYES! I was blinded by the sequins and dazzled from the home bedazzled shirts.  OMYEYES! I swear, everyone was over 60 and complaining about their meals. I was surrounded by senior citizens who bitched and complained then threatened to NOT pay for their meals.  Personally, I felt like they were scamming the place. I know customer service is a thankless job, but sometimes customers are way too cheap and shouldn't be eating out.

Breakfast wasn't so bad, but I found it incredibly bland and laden with salt. Within an hour of eating there I was *parched*. Their \"sourdough\" pancakes didn't remind me of sourdough in the slightest. Their scrambled eggs seemed to have been made from liquid eggs, solidifying my belief that I'm too young for this establishment. The only true highlight were the corn muffins that were brought out while we waiting.  YUM.

I felt so cheap and tacky walking through Home Depot after while guzzling 4 bottles of water.  Yes, I paid for them. The fluid retention from my salt intake was enough to make me think they had some MSG in their food.

Long review short? If you like salty food and cantankerous seniors, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Decent service.  Super cold - the AC was set way low.  Can't go wrong with Uncle Herschel's Favorite."}
{"text":"Yep never coming back here. I used to only pick here to eat breakfast almost every weekend . I developed a gluten allergy and when I had to change what I ate their menus for food allergies are extremely small but I made the best of what options I had and ordered 3 scrambled eggs and a side of fruit. For 2 strawberries and 1 small slice of pineapple it was 3.00. My eggs did not look like 3 eggs was 5.00 . Our server sucked, the cashier asked me how everything was I replied terrible and she didn't even acknowledge my complaint and just said to insert my card..."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrell the food is great. The service is excellent and I love browsing and shopping in the Old Country Store.   Overall a wonderful experience every time."}
{"text":"Having grown up in an extremely urbanized environment in California, this kind of store/restaurant is not something that I had access to. While this is a chain, my first impressions of it were quite positive--I rather like the idea of having something resembling an old country Southern establishment, even if done mainly for the nostalgic or touristy effect.

The service is great and friendly, and the menu is pretty extensive. I wouldn't call this kind of food the healthiest that one can eat,, but their fried fish, turnip greens, and cornbread muffin are pretty attractive. The buttermilk fried chicken wasn't all that great, but the menu has so many other things that I will probably go back to try something else multiple times. The gist of the restaurant is that it feels like a classier and more upscale Eat N Park.

The store itself is quite interesting. Selling anything from old trinkets to toys to CDs to snacks, they really do induce a nostalgic feel in you, even if you didn't grow up with any of those things. Before leaving we bought some vintage sodas (4 for less than $5, not bad), with brands that I don't recognize at all. Hopefully will be a good alternative to the highly processed corn syrup drinks nowadays!"}
{"text":"I'VE ONLY HAD BREAKFAST HERE!

Was here many times in summer of 06 and 07, and it's still the BEST breakfast I have EVER had!!! Pancakes are huge and fluffy, bacon was thick and well done, eggs were tasty and fluffy and they have their own house Maple syrup. Prices are good, portions are generous and food is the best!!

The country store has tons to choose from. I always end up leaving with a bag full when my goal was to stuff my face. 

A/C is always on, wait times can be lengthy depending on time of day but so well worth it. 

You can even get a nice tan waiting outside in the misters."}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night, food was  delicious.
Customer service 4 stars
Food 3 Stars  (Close To 4)
Atmosphere 4 stars
I had the haddock fish dinner, fish was cooked excellent. Grits were also cooked well. Great waitress, definitely hope I get her when I return."}
{"text":"I can describe Cracker Barrel in one word: CROWDED!!!  My family and I went here twice and ate here once. The first time we came we were told that the wait is an hour and 10 minutes. No way. So we got smart for the next day and went to the website where you can add your name to the waiting list. Once we arrived, it was a 15 minute minute wait. 

During those 15 minutes I spent my time in the \"country store\" looking at useless stuff for sale. I remember that other Cracker Barrel's in the south sold cute things and yummy treats. This location has very few treats and a lot of junk. Even so, it was wall to wall people and very hard to get around the store. 

We were seated against the wall and even with the shade drawn down I had sun beating against the side of my face and the other lady had sun directly in her face. Nothing could be done about it except squint. When the meal was almost over, the sun did move so it wasn't so bright.

I ordered pancakes and eggs, two ordered meatloaf, and one ordered chicken fried steak. My pancakes were really good and cooked just right. Fluffy on the inside and a crunch on the outside. Grits were served but they weren't that good because they were runny. Biscuits and cornbread came but neither were very tasty. Easily skipped. 

The service was wonderful. Overall, I would come back here again but I'd never come without putting my name on the wait list first. It's not the best food but it's nostalgic and I guess that counts for something,"}
{"text":"The wait here has been ridiculous since it opened so I decided to order food to-go since I live nearby.  The first time I ordered (yesterday) they gave me a bag missing half of the food.  I called to complain and the manager was gracious enough to offer to take care of my to-go order the following day.

Today I called to cash in on my free meal and explained to the person who took my order and the person who gave me my food the order was free because they messed up my order yesterday.  Get home and, wouldn't you know, missing food again.  This time I turned around and went back up there to get it and now I'm at home eating cold ass eggs.

I grew up on Cracker Barrel and have never dealt with suck crappy service and a lack of attention to detail.  Bottom line, I'll be going back to egg works for breakfast.  It's not worth it to make multiple trips for what ends up being subpar, cold food.  Until they get their operations together, I won't be back."}
{"text":"I hardly write reviews but this one deserves it. I was seated in 5 mins of arrival to the place, that was great. We sat at our table for 10 mins until we were asked what we wanted to drink. Drinks were brought immediately, so that was fine. 8 mins later we were asked to order. Our food did not arrive for another 30 mins. So now we are almost an hour into it and I was upset. Food looked a little in the cold side. I asked server to give us to go plates because I was not eating food there after feeling like we were not important. People who arrived after me were already eating and almost done, that disturbed me. I offered to pay after speaking to manager,  but I realized that $30 for cold food was not worth it for my pre New Years eve celebration lunch. So I left the food and told them that I was not paying and walked away. Thanks for ruining my first time visiting you and a special end of year lunch with my wife."}
{"text":"1: Never order an omelete at cracker barrel.

I have been to many cracker barrels growing up, this by far is my least favorite location. It started with me asking the host if they make omeletes at their location. \"Of course!\" she says. We proceed to sit down and be greated by our waitress, I ask for an omelete with three fixins (four if you count cheese). \"I willl see what they can do\" she says, so I ask \"If its a problem I can order something else\", she says \"No we can do it!\". I receive my plate and see what looks like cheese on a flat egg that was folded with fixings just placed in inside, not melted with the cheese and not part or in the egg. I eat because Im starving and think to myself \"Not what I wanted but I will make due\". I later receive the bill, each fixin was almost two dollars on a three egg omelete, this was mushroom, bacon, brocolli, and cheese. Everything but the cheese was charged as a full side dish. I go to pay, no one at the register, for at least 7 mins,however many of the coworkers chatting away. Finally someone comes up to the register, \"How did you enjoy your meal?\" she asks. \"Eh, it was ok\", I say. Then a shorter woman who appears to be a manager approaches from my left asking \"Was something bad about your meal?\" I explain my meal to her and she responds \"Well omeletes are not on the menu, but at least they tried to customize an order for you \" I explain about the hostess and no response. Just a thick air of tension as my girlfriend and I leave.Never again."}
{"text":"What can you say about Cracker Barrel, sometimes it is good and sometimes not so good. My granddaughter got a steak dinner and it looked good, steak well done instead of medium well but she was okay with it. They never brought her biscuits she ask for that came with her meal. My burger was burnt, the bacon on it was burnt. Won't ever get a burger there again. Service wasn't bad, but not great either and they were not busy, only about 5 tables at the time we went."}
{"text":"Great food and fun place to be. I always love shopping while we wait yi be seated. Normally a wait but if you browse around their store the time seems to go by faster"}
{"text":"Only had to wait for 45 minutes which wasn't bad at all, however we did get here before the dinner rush. People complaining about the wait needs to chill out its a new and very popular place to eat at so of course it will be a be wait. As soon as we walked in the staff was so friendly and down to earth. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Yet again another cracker barrel. they are great for a good southern cooked meal"}
{"text":"Like just about every other Cracker Barrel. If you want a good southern cooked meal, this is the place to come to"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but it let me down a bit. Since this was my first time there, I will only knock off one star. It appears that they have some new employees, their inexperience showed. When it came time to pay, it took forever and the help of a Manager to ring us up. Cashier did something to her register and could not undo it, line behind us was growing longer and you could feel the stares.  Food was ok, I left still a bit hungry. Cornbread was good and I like the fact that they serve their drinks in a glass and not a plastic cup. Plenty of parking and employees were nice. No wait to be seated at 6:30 pm."}
{"text":"The food was delightful as always but the service was amazing all thanks to Kevin! He was very attentive, personable, and made the interaction feel like you were at a friend's house enjoying a home cooked meal. Good service is typically the norm at just about any Cracker Barrel, but Kevin absolutely went above and beyond for us, making this visit a stand-out one. We will definitely be back to seat at his section."}
{"text":"Stopped at Cracker Barrel in Buckeye on way to CA. Great meal. Great service from Jazmen! She let us know about some \"secret\" menu items... Grandma's Breakfast! Offered to-go drinks... great job. She REALLY knew the menu and was able to make informed recommendations. A+

Oh, and she could talk all-things Ninja Turtles with my fangirl daughter. Awesome job, Jazmen."}

{"text":"I had my first Cracker Barrel experience today.  

My friend's birthday is tomorrow, so I took her out for the afternoon.  I asked her where she wanted to eat and she said Cracker Barrel.  They don't have Cracker Barrels on the west coast (where I'm originally from), so this was a thrill for me.

I don't know about you, but whenever I hear something about southern food, I immediately recall every Paula Deen episode I've ever watched on the Food Network.  Bring on the butter and collared greens!

Amanda warned me about the gift shop, so I wasn't too overwhelmed when we walked in looking for the dining room entrance.  It seemed we interrupted a conversation between three employees, so it took a minute for them to greet us. When they did, we were promptly seated and I was transfixed by their menu of southern eats.

I loved all of the vintage farm items hanging from the walls and the games.  Our waiter (Nick) was super friendly, but he kept forgetting about us and the items we requested, so that was sad.  At one point, I had to ask a different server to find him. When my friend ordered her salad and asked about dressing, he couldn't remember what kind of dressing it came with, but he did give us his personal recommendations, which I appreciated.

The food was yummm-my!  I decided to throw my diet out the window and order a plate of BBQ pork with mac-n-cheese and hashbrown casserole on the side, accompanied by a buttermilk biscuit and corn muffin.  The muffin was dry, but the biscuit was heavenly.  Amanda had the Grilled Chicken & Strawberry Salad and could barely finish it.  I ordered a side salad and was convinced it could've been my meal (it was big!), well until Nick brought out my entree.. no words, just mmmm.

The prices were reasonable and I didn't even mind that I could hear the noise and chatter from the kitchen while we ate.  The staff sounds like a happy bunch.  The gift shop was a fun place to browse, too.  We found an abundance of Americana to cheese over, chocolate covered jelly beans, DVDs and toys that took me back to my youth, and lots of scented candles to stick our noses in to.  I was tempted to buy the picnic-themed pajama pants and a copy of Kenny Rogers' CD of hymns (oh Kenny, why did you ever get that facelift?).

Overall, I give \"The Cracker Barrel Experience\" a 3.5."}
{"text":"First time to Cracker Barrel...had such high hopes after all the people I spoke but sadly the food was bland and the service was even worse. Had the chicken fried steak with corn bread, fried okra, corn and hash brown casserole. The food completely tasteless...the only good part of my meal was the hash brown casserole. The waitress that helped us was awful...had to ask her 4 times for napkins...twice for straws and boxes."}
{"text":"The Friday Fish Fry is fantastic! I had the 4-piece cod fry. The batter was light, crispy (it didn't taste oily!), and lightly seasoned. But surprising was the tartar sauce! NormallyI hate tartar sauce, but this one actually complimented the fish without burying the fish flavor! Well-done, Cracker Barrel! Great service, great food, and a nice goodies shop (nostalgic nick-knacks and sweets) to bide your time!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in many years. In my mind the food was tastier than my breakfast was. It was OK, just bland. Service was acceptable. If I was out on the road I might stop at one just because it is a known quantity."}
{"text":"It has been several years since I have been here as it is no longer on my way to work.  However the other morning I needed to get to work early and didn't have the time to cook a breakfast and Cheerios were not going to cut it on a Saturday.  For some reason hash brown casserole and grits popped in to my mind.  The place, food and service had not changed a bit.  I had a breakfast with eggs, sausage, hash brown casserole, grits, sausage and biscuits.  Got what I expected and waddled away full.  Really a 3.5, just not rounded up."}
{"text":"Food is good, tons of carbs. We were told it would take 20 minutes for a table of four, it actually took 38 minutes. The host still kept telling everyone after us it would take 20 minutes. After they tell you your table is ready, you will wait another 5-10 minutes while they are getting it ready?? 
So really, the wait was really 48 minutes. Be prepared to wait and wait and wait."}
{"text":"Server was great and very attentive. I've never been to this chain before, and I definitely won't be going again. The food is bland and the portion sizes are ridiculous. The strawberry lemonade tastes like jam. However I'm giving it three stars as the store is amazing, great for present shopping."}
{"text":"Was with my besty and she said lets grab lunch, my treat and you don't have to put out, I said girl I am their!! Haha but no really that's how the conversation went down.

She loves Cracker Barrel and I hadn't been in a while so I was excited to go!  We had gone to a movie 1st before we ate so by the time we got there we were starving. We made our way up to the hostess and I guess she could tell we were starving and ushered us to our seats quickly. 

Then we were greeted by our server Mathew, who ladies he is quite the cutie, some small talk went down and movies were discussed told why yes I have seen The Hobbit, it was all the buzz. He got a gleam in his eye and he started riddling me this and riddling me that and then left to get the drinks we ordered. While he was gone I got a.d.d and forget he had just riddled me. He brought the drinks back and was expecting an answer, but I had to confess I already forgot what the exact riddle was.  

Yes, that's really how it happened, then Mathew said oh ladies this really isn't my table, my friend Brandon will be here to be taking over .So Brandon appeared and took our order, the country lovin girl inside me wanted something smothered in gravy and I saw they had Chicken Fried Chicken with gravy! And I paired it up with a sweet potato, mac & cheese and hash brown casserole. I have to say I really dug the sweet potato, it was perfect, the mac & cheese was delsih and couldn't get enough of the hash brown casserole, but what made me a little sad was there was barley any gravy smothering my chicken fried chicken, but man that chicken was good!

I quickly got over being saddened by the missing gravy and ordered me a double chocolate fudge coca cola cake,,,,oooooooommmmmmmmmmgggggggggggggg that cake is sooooo gooooooddddd!!!! 

I have to say for country home-style cooking and lil country store Cracker Barrel is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Not know for fine dining but for good old home cooked meals! Love Cracker Barrel!!  But tried their double chocolate coke a cola cake with vanilla ice cream and OMG that is some good cake!!!! Im already wanting more!!!  Love me some chocolate cake!!! 

Have to say I was looking forward to buying some items in the store, but since their system was down and credit purchases had to be called in that deterred me from shopping...oh well, I suck for not liking the wait."}
{"text":"We came in for dinner with the kids and our waiter's name is Rowan! He s absolutely amazing. A top notch waiter! He should train the rest of the waiters. We've been here many times and the food is always good but, the service was always questionable! Keep up the great work Rowan. We will be back to see you again."}
{"text":"I am sorry to hear about the bad food some people had here because we have never had a bad meal here. (update, just had a bad meal here.  The shrimp dinner.   one of the worst I have ever had.  They do fish so well but their shrimp was over breaded popcorn shrimp that did not have that country specialness that you expect from CB.  The hushpuppies were also dry and flavorless.)   I have had very good trout and also a very well done steak.   It fits into a narrow country recipe selection but when you are in the mood for that you can't beat the price and the quality of food.  Service has always been good, the environment is pleasant and there is plenty of room.  The bathrooms are very clean.  The gift shop has something for everyone.  We almost always find something and they don't particularly cater to out taste.   In the midst of country craft, bible baubles and kitchen kitch (is there such a thing?)  we have found some nice decorative items, ornaments, candy, and other gifts.

Found a hair in an egg and they immediately remade the entire meal and the manager came out to speak with us.   Good and appropriate recovery.   My pancakes this time around were not as flavorful as the last.  They were still good. 
On a cold winter day get a seat near the fireplace and have a nice home cooked meal.  The coffee has always been good too.   It isn't fancy stuff but still good.

Folks here are almost always very pleasant and talkative.

Update: The French Toast was nothing special.  Third meal I have had here that I didn't care for much.  Avoid it.  Ham was so-so as was the smoked sausage.  Not a good breakfast for me.   Coffee wasn't good this time either.   Staff continues to be great. 
I would suggest the management review all their dishes and step them up a notch.   The meals are underpriced.   Maybe this is leading to less quality dishes.  Stop this.  Raise the prices and improve the quality."}
{"text":"On 7/31 we took friends to eat at Cracker Barrel near East Towne Mall in Madison. Asked for sunny side up eggs, got scrambled. They reordered the eggs and got hard fried eggs. The special French toast strawberry cream cheese special was terrible. Maybe 8 half strawberries and a bland cream cheese mix on French toast.

Was totally embarrassed because we told our friends what a great place this was.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Came with the parents.  I just started my cleanse and was looking for healthier options.  Guess what?  They have a whole section for that.  YES!!!  And it tasted good too!  PLUS!  The chicken was crusted in corn flakes which I can have and the steamed veggies were pretty tasty too.  Service was pretty good too."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times, just can't believe that I never checked in or wrote about them.  I have always enjoyed their food and service.  But noticed the place just was not so clean (table & chairs) a little dirty.  =("}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good country breakfast, this is just the place for you. This is always our stop when we are on a road trip. It's the best place for breakfast and dinner. They're country fried steak is delicious! And they're biscuits are so fluffy. I honestly think every item on the menu is amazing. I always love coming here!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. The food is always awesome. The  Waiters is very pleasant and nice."}
{"text":"Ive been here a couple of times and ive never been disappointed. The service is always pretty quick, the food always tastes good and for being rather inexpensive you definitely dont leave hungry."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this restaurant, since I heard this place has very long wait times. My family and I have been waiting to come here for months now. However, I was really disappointed in most aspects of this business, mostly in respect to the food and the service.

Atmosphere: Awesome place. I love the decorations and the country theme. At the back of the menu, there was a story of the origins of Cracker Barrel, which I found super cute. I am not sure if it's true, but I like the idea when people were done with the stuff inside the barrel they used the barrel to play games (ex. chess) on top. The best thing I got from this experience was the mini game at our dining table. This game involved jumping pegs. The goal is to have one peg left. I generally love logic puzzles, and I played this game throughout breakfast (because of the long wait time and horrible food). I even bought it at the store next door, so I can figure the game out. This game seriously made my breakfast better. 

Service: We got there once it opened for breakfast and was seated immediately when we arrived. I was surprised that there were so many people there already since the place opened up 5 minutes prior. Once we got seated, everything went downhill. It took 20-30 minutes for a server to even come to us for our orders, and we even saw other tables getting frustrated because they were also attempting to place their orders. Once we finally placed our orders, it took them a very long time to give us the food. Maybe it's too early in the morning for people to work? Oh maybe, they really want to replicate the Southern attitude by being slow (I am being mean since they were rude to us). On top of that, our waiters gave us the wrong dishes, dishes that we did not order. When we told them their mistakes, they just apologized and did not try to correct their mistakes, except for the incorrect eggs. I guess they don't want generous tips. My dad also thought people were borderline racist, especially the manager who said hello to all the tables in the restaurant who had white families, except for us. But I have no proof of this. I can forgive bad service, if the food was decent.....

Food: Two words - bland and dry. Not sure how they turned food that I really enjoy into these dishes. I can make better these dishes better even though I am not a cook. I ordered Grandpa's dish (biscuits and gravy with fried chicken). Besides the gravy (which was the BOMB) and the eggs (tasted like eggs), everything including the hash, fried chicken, and biscuits were pretty horrible. I also requested the special butter they had for the biscuits. They were jam-like, and we did not see how the biscuits and that \"butter\" went together. I honestly prefer real butter or just a regular berry jam over this concoction. I ate one bite of each of my food, lost my appetite for food, then played my logic puzzle game. McDonald's was honestly way better than this. Denny's would have one Michelin star and Black Bear Diner will have two Michelin stars if other restaurants have to be compared to this place. 

Overall, the food and service are LESS than alright. I am not sure why the wait time is so long, maybe it's for the dinner which we haven't tried. This is a prime example of an overrated place. My family and I are pretty scarred from this experience and probably won't ever come here again, even if they paid us to. Hmmmm....maybe if they paid us to...but I probably only order the eggs (which they probably will get my order wrong and it will take more than an hour to even get) and gravy to-go.

Recommendation: Save your valuable time and go to Egg Works. You won't be disappointed. I come to Las Vegas 4X a year, and all the locals know about this place.

Update: They were not very good at making the food look decent. Just imagine the individual components that you get on a plate. TA DA."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and let me say I was not impressed. When you specify certain items are supposed to come with certain things that's what you expect and mine did not come like that. It says the pumpkin pancakes were supposed to come with cinnamon powdered sugar do you see any on it? I couldn't even tell my server because he never came back . My pancakes were burnt, my bacon was thin and my coffee was never refilled. Not to mention our server dropped off our check when he dropped off our food and never came back to check on us. However, the eggs were prepared perfectly. Store inside is cute but that's about it."}
{"text":"First time at a Cracker Barrel and I had a good experienced. Staff was friendly, attentive and had great costumer services. The food was good, reminded me of real home made country food. Service was fast and the prices are reasonable. I recommend it if you want some good old fashioned country style food."}
{"text":"not sure whats up w/all the bad reviews on this place, but i tried it last saturday night for the 1st time and had a great experience!!! it WAS crowded, it WAS a lil chaotic in the store . . but that was to be expected as it was on a saturday nite around 7ish.  our wait was only 20min and went by fast as we browsed the trinkets and candy... we were seated and greeted promptly by our server who was so sweet. i was torn btwn two plates so i asked her opinion, and went with what she suggested: meatloaf, mashed potatoes,mac n cheese, and a  salad. my husband ordered the country sampler, baked potato, pinto beans and greens w/a salad as well. i was starving as i hadnt eaten all day and when i mentioned that to her, she said 'hang on'. and ran to get corn muffins and warm buscuits for us to munch on... our salads came out in less than 5min and our entrees took maybe 15. it was really good, warm, down home country cooking that felt so good on a cold february night!!! when the bill hit the table, i was even more shocked about the low price!!! we usually dont get out of a restaurant for less than $70 + tip for just the 2 of us... but here it was only like $36!!! 

we liked it!! we will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel has the best home style food in Vegas!!! The store is incredible too."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food, good price. I love that they offer healthy alternatives like egg whites, turkey sausage, turkey bacon, non fat yogurt with fruit and more. Fun to look around the random store but why would you buy anything there? 

Cons: The wait is always forever to get in, tables are crammed together in 2 small rooms. No flavored creamer and drinks and food normally come out at the same time."}
{"text":"Before I say how tasteless the food is......the service is great! Friendly staff......but people usually go to a restaurant for the food and great service is a bonus. 

Will I go back?  NO

Food portions were small, took 41 minutes after order taken to get the food and then it was wrong.....they do not have the skillet breakfast like most Cracker Barrels do.  It doesn't seem as tho they use a grill anymore since the pancakes tasted fake and each were exactly like the other.   They do not serve the traditional buttermilk biscuits.....ours looked and tasted like they had been boiled."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cracker Barrel. Hubby & I spent the weekend in Vegas and as soon as we saw the sign from the 15, we knew we'd have to stop on our way back home. Got there around 11am on a Sunday, the hour wait was a given and didn't phase us. Took a short walk over to Bass Pro Shops to pass the time. Got a text notification that our table was ready, about an hour and 10 mins later. 

Favorites - the melt in your mouth pancakes, cheesy hash brown casserole, and biscuits & gravy. 

Service was excellent. Shout out to the hostesses for their patience after dealing with hangry people trying to break down the door all day!  Management, your girls are doing great work!"}
{"text":"CA needs a good breakfast place like this.

My fave that I always order is the Momma's French Toast Breakfast with a side of Hashbrown Casserole.

The French Toast comes nice and crunch topped with butter and 2 little maple syrup jars - I love to control how much maple syrup per each bite size toast.

Love the smokiness to the Smoked Sausage Patties and the crunchiness to the Hasbrown Casserole."}
{"text":"went to the new cracker barrel in Victorville, there food was pretty bad, the bisques were dry tasted like flour, the muffins were worse, had the roast beef, which had no flavor at all, and all the vegetables were cooked to death and also had no taste, never go back"}
{"text":"Every time I go to AZ  I love to visit this place. They even have a gift shop, so cute and the food is really delicious and price are reason"}
{"text":"I'd seen a few Cracker Barrels while traveling across the I-40 and was very curious to see what they served. When I finally got settled in Charlotte, I decided, it's high time I check out a Cracker Barrel! So I did. The decor was just how I'd imagine it, real kitschy. We were seated immediately and brought a plate of bread before we ordered. Awesome. We placed our orders and right before our entrees came two different waiters came by with more bread. At this point, we had 3 plates of bread on our table. A little ridiculous. The biscuits were good but the corn biscuit or whatever tasted funny, maybe I'm just not accustomed to that taste. Anyway, our server was friendly and good about getting our food out in a timely manner, but super slow in bringing us the check. The food itself was typical Southern fare and most of the it was rather enjoyable. I had the catfish platter, which was a bit too oily for my liking. But the sides were in general very tasty. Although, the Fried Apples just looked like canned pie filling. I think I enjoyed the little game they had at the table the most. 

This is just one of those places you go, just to say you've been. At least for this city slicker. If I come more often, I know one of my arteries will harden over."}
{"text":"We love Cracker Barrel but for some reason this location is having a lot of issues. The last four times we have gone there we have got raw chicken, forgotten orders, and wrong orders. Also it seems like they run out of items a lot then don't tell you they are out until everyone else has their food. It seems like the wait staff, who are very nice, are overwhelmed or the kitchen people mess up a lot. Going to start going to the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Food wasn't good for me my chicken tenders were dry and hard. They only gave me 3 said it was 4. Brought me another it was burnt. I've eaten there before and it was much much better."}
{"text":"Took over 20 minutes for our food to come out after we ordered. Took a few bites of my sandwich and then bit into a nice black curly hair. Let's just say... We will not be coming back, ever again. The not so friendly manager took care of the problem, but my throat still itches!"}
{"text":"Our server, Karen, was awesome! The wait time was a little long. I expected that as it's a very popular place. When you come from a place that doesn't have Cracker Barrel, the closest one is always packed. Karen knew the menu and knew exactly what to suggest. My husband enjoyed his catfish and I enjoyed my ham, eggs and apples. The serving size is plentiful. If you want a nice, warm delicious country meal, this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"I'm Southern. It's a chain food staple. Sweet tea, fri d okra, chicken and dumplins. Country store! Can't go wrong with CB for yummy comfort food on the go!"}
{"text":"Such a pathetic excuse for one of my favorite restaurants ever. The Cracker Barrel near 27th ave and deer valley has horrible management and even worse servers. Jamee took over ten minutes just to greet us then it took another 10 minutes just to get our drinks. Another 5 minutes just to get straws. On top of it all the emailed gift card I got for my birthday was on my phone. It had a bar code and even a card number on it. But according to the manager (if you want to call him that) gave me a worthless excuse that \"they aren't supposed to take it unless it was printed.\" He didn't care about having any form of customer service and even acted like I had ruined his day for even asking about not having it printed. He probably can't even spell customer service let alone define and portray it. I didn't get his name unfortunately but he was a heavy set older gentleman with grayish hair glasses. An absolutely pathetic excuse for a \"manager\""}
{"text":"We had gift cards. The place was packed and we had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Not terrible, but I hate waiting! 

I got the 10 oz. ribeye steak with a nice salad and a baked potato with melted butter and sour cream. We also had muffins and cornbread which were good. For dessert, I had the apple pie with vanilla ice cream. For some odd reason, the dessert was totally sugarless! I don't know if they are trying to appeal to diabetics or senior citizens, but I wish they had used sugar. The flavor was lacking!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great things about Cracker Barrel so my husband and I thought we'd check it out. I love how the inside is decorated, you feel like you're at home. I got the strussel French toast, very good! The plate with the eggs and bacon didn't have a good presentation, it was just thrown on there. The eggs didn't have any flavor to them but the bacon was good. My husband got the country fried steak and eggs which came with biscuits and gravy. The gravy didn't have much of a taste. The hash-brown casserole was really good. The service was also good. Overall it was a good experience but I probably wouldn't go here for a normal breakfast place."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a country cooking type of meal, Cracker Barrel is definitely the spot. The pancakes are really good, the sides are tasty, & the biscuits & corn muffins are plentiful. 

I love chicken & dumplings typically, but that was one of the dishes that I was disappointed in. It lacked flavor. The chopped steak was flavorless as well. The quality of the meat was pretty below average.

Surprisingly, my favorite dish here is their crispy chicken salad. The salad is fresh, loaded with chicken, & they give you more than enough!"}
{"text":"I love my stops at CB. Unfortunately, this one agitated me.

We stopped around 2:45pm on a Tuesday.  The restaurant was only about 1/2 full, so we were quickly seated and greeted.  I'm fairly certain our server had not been at this job for very long.. that or she just didn't care about her guests.

She never told us her name, tersely took our drink and lunch orders and left.  She brought 2 of  our 3 meals out a good 5 minutes before the 3rd meal arrived and didn't seem to notice that the chicken on my salad was completely burnt.  I asked a 2nd server to take it back and she clearly noticed and was apologetic (wish she had been our ACTUAL server).  Non-burnt chicken was brought back and handed over by our original waitress - no apologies. Not a word.  Just a pass of the plate.

Drinks were left empty.

Food (once corrected) was tasty, as I always expect from a CB - we enjoyed grilled chicken salads and meatloaf with green beans and broccoli.  The service, however, was grossly lacking."}
{"text":"Zackary made our long wait experience awesome. Great conversation very friendly fast. Thank you Zackary we appreciate your service."}

{"text":"This is probably the best Cracker Barrel I've ever been to! 

Cracker Barrel is a massive guilty pleasure of mine. Southern breakfasts are one of my favorites. Chicken fried steak, grits, and hashbrown casserole? Are you kidding? Count me in! 

The service at this location is excellent. Our waitress was particularly lovely and helpful. 

This was the first time I had pancakes at cracker barrel and it was a great decision. The blueberry pancakes with the blueberry syrup were AMAZING. Best pancakes ever. The hashbrown casserole and fried apples are always necessary as well. 

The frozen mug apple cider was addicting but I limited myself to just one. 

The shop at the front of the restaurant always has a million things I want to buy but I limit myself to one treat each visit. I wish there was a location closer to home!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy. Went here for breakfast and the service was great, friendly, and attentive. The portion sizes of the food are big, food comes out fast. Great place and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Pam was our extremely attentive, and patient, waitress. Food was excellent, as always. Usually we avoid Sunday's but the turnaround was quick!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy the breakfast food here and the atmosphere of the store is always fun.  The service was great (5/5) and the food was very good (5/5).  The coffee was a bit weak but doable.  I had the pecan pancakes with 2 eggs and bacon and da boss had biscuits and gravy and hash brown casserole. All were delish (5/5).  Didn't have biscuits and cornbread as I did not want to fall into a food coma.  This is a very good instance of CB."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed in Cracker Barrel I have been to them all over the country, I introduced it to my in laws who are from California where they don't have one and now we have to go every time they visit. Around Christmas time is my favourite when they have their giant fire place lit. The meatloaf dinner, turkey dinner, fish fry, sunrise sampler breakfast and pancakes are the best. The hash brown casserole is amazing and being from a southern family even the grits are good. And the little shop in the entrance of the restaurant always has the cutest stuff and old fashioned candy. You're guaranteed to love this place !"}
{"text":"Dropped in on our way to Texas to meet my cousin for lunch. I know that this restaurant is a franchise but we don't have many of them in California (if any at all) so it was a treat for us. Our waiter was an older man with a quick wit and a sense of humor. 
Other than not having my first choice ( a Reuben) the food was good and we got to visit with my cousin who's as smart and pretty as ever!
Easy access off of I-10."}
{"text":"The service is what makes this place a restaurant worth returning.  This Glendale location is better than the ones closer to my house."}
{"text":"I used to really like the Cracker Barrel restaurant but the past few times I've been, the food has been progressively worse each time. Mostly bland food and grilled chicken tenders drier than my grandmother's teeth! Some of the heavily carb laden foods which includes the biscuits are pretty good but I find the food taste, temperature and texture to be inconsistent. So to wrap up- if you're practicing your piggy moves then I'd go but if you're trying to cut back then I'd so skip this place! And avoid the grilled chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"The food is always great & the location is perfect for us. The only complaint I have is that the wait time can be long. They will seat you promptly, but the food prep takes a while. It's great for family dinners & who can beat delicious breakfast all day?!"}
{"text":"I had brunch here, and found myself chewing on something sharp and hard which turned out to be a piece of plastic!

I informed the server who had the manager come out and talk to me. The manager told me that their sauce comes in plastic containers and the plastic probably came from that. That it! He walked away, didn't even offer to not charge for the ruined meal.

I paid the bill and left. Surprisingly poor customer service. Won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"The uncle hershel breakfast is the best. The blueberry pancakes are awesome also, most of all the price is excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian, so if you are a meat and potatoes type of person ignore my star reviews.  

I ended up getting the blueberry pancakes, which were good considering the place I was at.  They were not perfectly round and have fresh blueberries, so like what I would make at home.  Not the perfect cookie cutter ones like at IHOP.  
I did love I got my own jar of blueberry compote, it was warmed up too.  (I kept the bottle, I love little things like that.)

Every dish on the menu was meat, except for the veggie platter (I believe that is what it is called).  The breakfast menu was the one that had the least meat dishes. 

The server was very friendly, I asked for decaf iced tea so he brought me hot decaf tea and a cup of ice.  Like that he did that.  The server was very nice.

We got there around 7 pm, it was very busy with in an hour many of the snowbirds had left.  

The food took awhile to get to us after ordered it.  The place is also very packed together.    

They give us biscuits and a cornbread which are very dry and flavorless to me.  (we always make our own bread and cornbread so restaurant varieties just don't match up).  

If anyone is eating post weight loss surgery and don't eat meat, it's not a very good place.   

The store had a lot of cute kitschy items.  I didn't check the whole store, but they had a lot of candy in big boxes and some toys.  They did have a lot of kitchen and rooster items for the kitchen.  I thought those were adorable."}
{"text":"Sooooo happy!!
I just had the best breakfast in a long time & the best service ever! Ashley was amazing & top of everything, always smiling & so attentive!  We will definitely be back to see her!!"}
{"text":"I had the BLT, the bread was a little bit soggy, also with vegetable beef soup, was okay."}
{"text":"Love this place. Husband and I stop by everytime we are in town. Food is always delicious, service is outstanding, and we never wait more than 5 minutes to be seated."}
{"text":"Wait time was 25 minutes, not too bad. Service was bad, Food was like cafeteria food, nothing like the cracker barrel back east! We ordered chicken and dumplings, the chicken tasted like it was frozen not fresh, the dumplings were huge globs of flour, very bland... Green beans taste like canned, and Mac n cheese was watery with no flavor, corn bread was super dry, very disappointed, the only good thing was the raspberry lemonade, and raspberry tea.  I'd rather have chicken n dumplings in a can..."}
{"text":"The only reason this place has 3 is because the service was great. Aside from that, it was pretty disappointing for all the hype. I feel like the biscuits and gravy were pretty sad. Biscuits tasted like I was just eating straight flour. Gravy tasted just as plain. I don't think I've ever had gravy that tasted so plain. I feel like a good biscuit can be enjoyed alone with no gravy, jam, or even butter. 

I ordered the Uncle Hershel's Favorite - Fried Cat Fish. This is pretty delicious actually, but the fish portion was pretty small. Smallest fillet ever. If the portion was doubled, I'd be happy. The tartar sauce is yum! I ordered a side of sugared ham, it came cold. Didn't taste bad, probably be amazing if it came straight from the pan still sizzling a little. 

BF got the Sunrise Sampler and couldn't be more disappointed with the portions. I think it came with 1 bacon, 2 small sausage patties(like smaller then a egg mcmuffin sausage), and some ham. We ended up ordering some French toast to help fill the both is up since they were small portions and we were not digging the biscuits, gravy, and grits. (Comes with every meal)  we should've asked is we could have toast instead. 

Come at your own risk if haven't tried it before. If you like small portions and basic tasting breakfast, then by all means this place is for you."}
{"text":"The Country Chef Salad is my favorite!!

Staff was friendly and fast, and we were sent on our way with to-go drinks - great for our road-tripping!"}
{"text":"We stopped into Cracker Barrel for lunch.  The first thing you notice is the decor is that of a flea market yet homey at the same time.  The place was busy so there was a ten minute wait for a table, but giving there is a country type store which acts as the lobby, time fly's by while browsing.  The seating is also very homey and inviting with oil lamps on the tables and a large wood burning fire place. The food is great with large portions and reasonable pricing.  I recommend a visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty long wait(1.5 hrs) but it just opened. Pretty much the same as the food at the stores in Utah or Arizona; staff was friendly and helpful here. Price is about adequate to above price for southern comfort food, nothing amazing but a fun place to eat!"}
{"text":"First, I am a huge fan of Cracker Barrel,  I would go all the time when I lived back in Ohio.  Not only do they have the BEST sweet tea in town, but their breakfast and dinner options are great.  Especially if you are looking for some great home cooked quality meals.  They make the best Fried Okra!  It's one of the sides I always get when I go.  Breakfast wise, Love getting eggs with bacon and pancakes or french toast.  Plus their biscuits with apple butter is irresistable.  That is a must on every visit.  I also feel you get tons of food for the price!  You can't go wrong.  They also have a great shopping area up front with old school candies, Yankee Candles, Hoilday Décor, and giftables.  I miss that they aren't here in Northern CA.  It's one of the first places I crave when I am visiting back in town.  The staff here is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Simple country food.  I come here for the chicken livers; can't get them any place else.  Fried apples and hash brown casserole are the best sides."}
{"text":"Its been said when you get married, you not only marry your spouse, you marry the whole family.

Mothers day,  2018, my wife and I took our daughters, my sister in law, my wife's uncle and wife's grandmother to Cracker Barrel.

This is a personal favorite for Family dinning. The kids play checkers and that peg board game. Does it have a name?

For a meal I ate grilled chicken with Cole slaw and a small salad. The food always good. Not the greatest ever, but good.

There is always a wait at Cracker Barrel for a table. It doesn't matter what the location is. We've been to the locations in Saint George Utah, Kingman Arizona,  and both in Las Vegas Nevada. Always a wait for a table.

The wait... it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place was just okay. Food was mediocre, the waitress we had was not very good. Most of the time she was trying to do 3-4 things at once. Example: get our coffee, get another tables order, grab butter for someone,  and then she'd forget all 3 and start something else. The food was just okay. We did enjoy the store and picked up two gifts. We were not impressed and will not be back to a Cracker Barrel restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service and food. Our server Michael a white man was very rude since the get go. We asked for the basic things and kept being rude over and over. But with the white customers he was friendly and smiling. Just because we are Hispanic doesn't give him the right to be ignorant and rude. Michael needs to get some manners and learn to be nice to all the customers not just the white ones. Get another job if you don't want to serve us."}
{"text":"This place has big portion sizes and cheap prices, excellent food! I had the special homestyle chicken and it was great!! Good job crack pipe"}
{"text":"Since there is no possible way to say this lightly, I will be straight up and let you know what I thought of this place. If you are coming here and you're claustrophobic and you have to wait for a table, this is not a place for you to be. The staff is friendly, but some of the staff is not so friendly. 

Here's the reason I'm giving this such a low rating, we came here on a Monday morning looking to have breakfast before our flight. We made sure to give plenty of time so we were here by 10 in the morning which our flight wasn't until two in the afternoon plenty of time to make sure we have our meal without rushing. We have to wait 20 minutes for a table on a Monday morning, the lobby which there is none so we waited outside until our names were called. We were sat at our table, along with three other tables that were sat around us at the exact same time. It took our waiter 15 minutes just to come and say hi and ask if we want to drinks. By the time our drinks came back which was another 10 minutes, we were ready to place our order which we did. If you minutes went by, and then we started to notice the tables that sat down after us Headstart to receive their meals. We asked the waiter which we finally got his attention after 15 minutes of trying to flag somebody down. He said he would return, of course he did not. I then asked to speak to a manager which promptly a manager did show up. He checked on our meals which we discovered at that time where never placed, at that time it was realize we have been there for almost an hour with no food one drink and a lot of frustration. I have always wanted to come to a Cracker Barrel, but now no I will never return to one due to the lack of service I received at this location. I am sure other locations are much better and you give better service, but I will not take that opportunity to find out due to the lack of service from the staff here at this location.

On a sidenote yes the manager was willing to give us a free meal which I was not willing to take because I do not want to wait anymore time for a meal to arrive."}
{"text":"My husband & I just went to this Cracker Barrel for Thanksgiving dinner. We knew the wait would be long, but the wait for food was even longer and then it arrived lukewarm. I asked to substitute turkey for the ham, but they said \"no substitutions\" and the ham was very salty and smoked and quite hard. But the worst thing is that the portions were TINY. There may have been a tablespoon of cranberry sauce, maybe 1/4 cup of mashed sweet potatoes and the same with the stuffing. There may have been a teaspoon of gravy on the turkey. The server was nice, but we don't plan to go back for child portions with adult prices!"}
{"text":"Service: our waitress was great came by all the time our tea and water glasses were always full never empty. 

Food: we all loved our food the temperature was right and tastes fresh we were all full and happy that's always nice when you have another 5 hours to go before you get home."}

Thank you Mandy!!!"}
{"text":"Typical Cracker Barrel with decent breakfast and fast service. The biggest negative is walking past all that candy and trying not to buy any, but that's a Lyndsay Problem, not a Cracker Barrel Problem."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast. For years Ive been hearing how great this place is...WTH?  What a disappointment!  Food was luke warm to cold, bland and just yucky. Maybe lunch would be better? Im afraid to try..."}
{"text":"I was expecting some really good country food. Not! The biscuits were cold, tasted like salty raw pancake batter with the added bonus of rock hard butter they give you. The corn bread was disgusting! The portions were teeny tiny. The fried chicken tasted bland with a weird after taste. I will never come back to this Cracker Barrel again."}
{"text":"I love this store!!!! I wish they had 1 in California. This is the closest one to me!! So I only come out here once a year, when we go to AZ for spring training. This place has the cutest stuff. And a great selection on old school candy! I didn't go to the restaurant this time but I have been before. They had good food as well, such as chicken and dumplings, which I consider cozy and a great home cookin' meal!! I'll be back next year!!!"}
{"text":"Sat there for a half hour only to get my steAk over cooked sat another 20 minutes while they were recooking it.  Bye bye no more never got my steak cooked right"}
{"text":"Ok i sure hope this gets better. Table was dirty, silverware was dirty, napkin was dirty, food served like slop for a pig. Manager was super cool and way sweet and replaced my food and brought me clean silverware. BUT my frigging foods cold as hell and the server was like oh its plenty warm enough. WTF?! love Cracker barrel and i always have but this was unacceptable. I AM TRULY DISGUSTED WITH THIS CRACKER BARREL..."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Cracker Barrel after moving back from the mid west.  I was fine having to wait 1 1/2.  And then it went down hill from there, I was seated in the corner which was fine until It took over 20mins to get water after flagging someone down. Asked to place my order only to wait another 1 1/2 to get food after talking to the manger  several times.  And he couldn't get anything right either.  Are food was fine, even though it was all wrong..... BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I've had great experiences at this location but when I recently went for breakfast with a friend of mine I received the wrong order. I asked for French toast and got pancakes but due to the morning rush I decided not to say anything. I enjoyed the pancakes but I really wanted the French toast. My waitress even charged me for French toast but the pancakes were the same price so i still didn't say anything to her. It was just a little annoying."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY CRACKER BARREL???

Last time we ate at CB was about 5 years ago, we traveled by road from California to Florida and back with virtually all our meals eaten at Cracker Barrel's along the way.  LOVED THIS PLACE.   We were excited to see a new location open on the way into Vegas.  With BIG anticipation we rolled in on Sunday morning for chicken fried steak and their (used to be) amazing hash brown casserole.   When looking for directions in Yelp we noticed only 3 stars which should have been a warning.    The portions are notably smaller and the much beloved chicken fried steak was merely okay but the biggest disappointment was the hash brown casserole which was so heavily laden in garlic powder the you could not taste anything else.   Was so excited to go but came to the sad realization that this was my last trip to which was truly an eating institution....  I might have given 2 or 3 stars if I didn't know how good it used to be"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service... organizing a large volleyball team with families who were unorganized.  The food was even better than expected.  First time trying catfish and it was awesome."}
{"text":"I used a loyal customer of this establishment, but then I got food poisoning from their chicken and dumplings so I stopped eating there for awhile, decided to try again & my first experience was good. But tonight's service was appalling my meal was improperly prepared it over a half an hour to finally speak to a manager about the problem, so I am no longer going to dining at establishments any longer I'm tired of crappy customer service."}
{"text":"I love the food here. If it wasn't for the food we wouldn't of waited an hour to get in then another 30 minutes for our food. Service was ok being that this was the 5th day of there grand opening. Assistant manager greeted us and I thought that was nice. Very busy but so worth it. I highly recommend the food here."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Vegas and while driving up the 15 freeway, I noticed the Cracker Barrel sign. I've visited the ones back east and it was a must that we visit the one in Vegas. The food was good. I had a big portion for the pancakes. It was more of a dessert because I got apples on top and they put whipped cream also. My husband said he wasn't too impressed with his mashed potatoes, but loved his raspberry lemonade in a chilled glass and the free refills! Our server Sadi did a great job and my husband and I both appreciated the customer service and environment. We had to make sure we left with a peg game of our own! I'm so happy they sell them! I'd come back again when I visit again!"}
{"text":"What can I say about my favorite restaurant in America? 

I was used to eating almost weekly at a Cracker Barrel when living in Florida. They don't have them in California so I was willing to drive quite a bit while visiting a friend in AZ just to eat at one. 

I was not disappointed. I got biscuits and gravy - a cracker barrel staple. 

This place was amazing. Service was excellent, and the manager even came to check on our group of eight."}
{"text":"Went late morning of 8-18-15. Waitress took my order which was very simple but brought me the exact wrong thing I wanted. She apologized but did nothing to rectify her mistake. 

Then as I went to pay the bill. The cashier was too busy being on a personal call and communicated with me using a series of annoyed hand gestures. Yeah real professional. 

The whole place just had a bad vibe after that. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"What can you say - Cracker Barrel serves consistent southern comfort food.  All I need to drive across country are gas stations and Cracker Barrel restaurants.  

The Goodyear location is often full during popular dining times and days (Nascar in town or not) .  6:30 Saturday morning is easy to get a table.  Wait until 8:00 in the morning and you will probably get on a half hour wait list.  They have plenty of outdoor rocking chairs to enjoy the usual awesome Arizona weather while you wait.  They aren't so popular to rock away the time in July though.  

I love their fried okra and turnip greens.  Not as good as my grandmother made but still worth my money."}
{"text":"In my travels, I am sometimes left no option but to eat at a Cracker Barrel, and frankly they always disappoint.  

This one is no exception, seriously how do you mess up breakfast?   The quantity of food for the price is probably fit for someone on weight watchers.  

In my opinion, going out for breakfast is a treat and one must always be catered to with a lot of food and leave feeling like a king.  

My life goal when traveling is to bypass CB and settle for McDonalds.   

I should add this is not a reflection of the wait staff, they are really good."}
{"text":"The tables here are very, very close to each other. Uncomfortably close. The kerosene lamps on the tables are somewhat large and they are permanently fixed to the table which presents a problem since they have wonderful food that comes in really large portions. So it was a bit annoying trying to juggle the dishes with the limited amount of space on the tables. Not to mention it was annoying having this big lamp in between me and the rest of my family as we were trying to talk to each other. As for the food, the meal I had was excellent. I had the Haddock fried fish which was awesome. I would have enjoyed it even more if during the whole meal I wasn't trying not to bump into the person behind me.  That person had a child on their lap and I could tell they were also trying not to bump into me as well. The rest of my family was 50/50 on how they liked their meals. My daughter's kid's meal burger was very, very dry. She hated this place. So, I had to hear here complaining the whole time about how she didn't like how people kept bumping her chair.  I think their opinions of their meals were a bit skewed by the fact that they were uncomfortable because of how close the tables were. For the price of food and the wait times, I would probably not come back just cause I like to be comfortable when I eat. This is disappointing because honestly the staff at this location was super nice and extremely helpful."}
{"text":"The service at this place is awful. I have been to this location on numerous occasions and it's always the same experience \"horrible\""}
{"text":"I love me some Cracker Barrel but not this location! The food was cold and the biscuits were hard. And God forbid you have the nerve to ask for softer ones! The waitress wasn't friendly to start with, then we went and asked her to do more work and she just glared at us and huffed off to get fresh bread. I was afraid to tell her my eggs were raw! The hash browns were hard too! The bright spot here is the lovely lady walking around in the store. She was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"I have been going to CB for over 20 years.  It was always great food.  However, they pre cook their food like McDonald's, Applebees etc and ship it in.  I ordered roast beef and there was a plastic sheet underneath like a frozen dinner.  We did not get out biscuits as requested. (11/01/2017)  Breakfast is good but I would not eat lunch or dinner anymore.  Service was OK.  Had to ask for biscuits twice and only received one refill."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to a Cracker Barrel ever. I'm from out west and I was excited to learn that Cracker Barrels were nearby. Seriously, I've heard so many wonderful things about the quality of food from friends who grew up around these places. So naturally, I was excited.

We arrived this morning to friendly staff. Since this was my first visit, I didn't fully understand where the restaurant was after entering the store. But it didn't take long to find it off to the left. We were seated promptly and offered our beverages quickly.

I didn't see much personality exuding from the wait staff. They were on point with bringing items to the table, but lacked some basic people skills important to a customer service industry (being personable, smiling, checking-in, etc). It was what it was, but flagging a server down for something extra we needed, such as water, can be a challenge.

My wife and I ordered the Sunrise Sampler, which I'd heard so many great things about. I was most excited about their biscuits and gravy, because I felt this we be done exceptionally well here. The food came out quickly and we dug right in. The first thing I ate was my grits, which I enjoyed. Sadly, that's about the last enjoyable part of the meal. I then started on my meats (sausage, bacon, ham). It was so salty, it was difficult to eat. But it's meat and I'm fat, so down the hatch they went. I then hit up my biscuit and gravy. My wife and I really believed the gravy was scorched in the pot, because it tasted burned. It didn't look it, but the burnt flavor was definitely present. The salt content wouldn't help their cause since it would enhance the burned flavor. The eggs were great, which is hard to screw up.

All said and done, the meal was one of the saltiest we've ever had. The service was fast, yet impersonal. If it were suggested by others to eat there again, I'd probably discourage it.

Also, as I type this, my wife and I are struggling with our day. We're both feeling weak in the stomach, and feel like we're going to be 'sick' soon (loosely and delicately put). We haven't been able to eat anything else since this morning. So ...there's that."}
{"text":"I came to this area on a business trip two days ago and wanted to try the famous Cracker Barrel while on a short break. I walked through the gift shop to the host's stand, where a sign said to wait for the host to seat me. So I waited. And waited. At least 3 full minutes passed. It was a bit busy inside, but I could see plenty of open tables, and several groups left as I waited. It was like I was invisible. I know southerners don't like pushy outsiders, so I remained quiet and relaxed. A wait person walked past me from the dining room/kitchen area and through the gift shop, walking away from the kitchen and, I can only assume, heading outside. I silently waited some more. 

An elderly couple had now joined me. Another wait staff exited the kitchen, walked past the growing crowd of us and through the gift shop, away from customers, also not looking at us. Soon a woman entered, pushing a companion in a wheelchair, and joined us, waiting a few minutes more. She was the one to finally speak up and politely ask the gift shop's cashier if there was a host on duty. \"Yes\" came her short reply, not even turning her head. At that moment, another wait staff, the third separate one I laid eyes on after well over 5 minutes of silently waiting to be acknowledged, walked past the 5 of us, just the like previous 2, through the gift shop. 

With that, I turned to the cashier and in a cheerful, loud voice and with a friendly smile, said my first word since entering: \"Goodbye!\" She didn't look or even register that she heard me. The folks behind me laughed and the woman pushing the wheelchair said \"Right!?!\" I walked out to my car and went to a nearby drive thru, miserable. Thanks, Cracker Barrel. Now I know what you really should be known for is miserable staff and no respect for the public. I'll never waste another minute in one of your restaurants ever again."}
{"text":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen,,, or at least they have at this location :(
We're going to do this by Pluses & Deltas

(pluses)

Friendly in person interactions with staff

(deltas)

Horrible phone service: hung up on me 2x: I called to let them know I had a large group heading over (as it says you should do on the website AND as I've done in the past). The person who answered the phone kept telling me I needed to talk to someone else. Maybe she didn't know how to transfer calls, because that was the last I'd hear. I won't be calling anymore. 

S.L.O.W. service: The place was almost empty, we were seated promptly & then waited 10 minutes for someone to come out and ask us what we'd like to drink & tell us our waitress would be with us momentarily. 20 minutes in our waitress finally came over to take our order & that was only because I grabbed someone who walked by and asked that they give her a message from me that we were ready to order.... this was all just to put in our order, we'd been seated for well OVER 30 minutes before our food came out (2 eggs over easy, toast & oatmeal)... maybe they were chasing the tiny chickens around to get our eggs? My coworker ordered oatmeal (not hard) & they forgot to put in the only thing that came in the oatmeal, the nuts. NUTS. 

Tiny eggs (maybe the chickens are getting smaller?).

All in all, just a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"A combination of comfort food and therapy shopping :)

I do love this place! All of the food is great, but my favorites belong in the breakfast category (and are served all day!); apple butter with my toast, fried apples & hashbrown casserole to accompany some eggs over easy and maybe some country ham :D 
My daughter favors the sawmill gravy and homemade buttermilk biscuits. 
Amazingly enough, there's a meal that has ALL of that included, LOL. We normally just split it and each still fill up to the brim :) 

After consuming copious amounts of food, we must walk it off, so we do this in the little shop... it's for our health ;) They have the cutest stuff, from candles & food to toys and seasonal items."}
{"text":"6am July  30 Out of Strawberry's  for pancakes . Took blueberries for sub. Never came till after we ate. Food was cold. One cup of coffee. Never seen the server again for refill till she gave me the check. Service was bad real bad. Mangers need to train staff better. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cracker Barrel. I'm from the south, born and raised, so going here really takes me home and gives me an exciting sense of nostalgia. I love the cute gift shop they have. Most of the stuff in it is overpriced but you can find really cheap confections, such as the stick candy, which I always like to stock up on when I go there because they're only 10 cents each, and they have lots of nice gifts to use for birthdays or Christmas.

I like to go here on Fridays for the fish fry because their cod is really good and it's very cheap. Most importantly, the staff is very friendly and always gives me that southern sense of hospitality without being overbearing like lots of waiters are. My only complaint is that the sweet tea is not sweet enough, and they're always super crowded in the mornings."}
{"text":"What! You've never been to Cracker Barrel?? Exclaimed my co worker. Coming from NYC where you're required to post caloric information it's hard to imagine any place like it. It's a southern version of ihops  on comfort food steroids. We proceeded to order a appetizer of biscuits with maple syrup, jelly and butter. Biscuits were light and fluffy with a salted top.

Entree consisted of a slice of savory ham, Mac and cheese, stuffing, meat loaf and chicken and dumplings. By far what I enjoyed the most was the dumplings, it was pure comfort food with that warm and fuzzy kid feeling.

Shuffled over to the rental car and slept it off at the hotel."}
{"text":"Headed here for a good old fashioned breakfast, since they are one of our go to places.  Pretty standard location for the chain with the country store up front to look through if there is a wait.  We were fortunate enough to get seated right away.  

Our waitress came over within a minute or two to take our order.  Food came out within 7-10 minutes after, so not long to wait at all.  Everything was made as requested.  The only real complaint we have is the eggs. It seems that they probably cook them to order in the pan and that they continue to cook on the plate, which means they are going to overcook just a touch.  Not really a big thing.

There was a bit of the line at the cash register, but the place is always busy in the mornings, so this wasn't too surprising! 

Overall: A-
Standard CB location, good for breakfast, service was decent!"}
{"text":"Great food, never had a bad meal or experience here. Take out is easy too. The chicken fried steak is to die for. Everything is awesome and the staff is excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Met up with some cousins here and fell in love with the little country shop at the entrance. So many cute things and a great way to kill time because there was a wait when we got there! However, it was breakfast time on Labor Day so it was expected. Wait was 30 min for 5 of us so It wasn't too bad, it went by fast. Looking at the menu everything was very decently priced. I would say average 10 bucks for a plate but you get so many things with your meal!! Hash brown casserole was amazing, that came with my meal along with grits and biscuits and gravy! Food was soooo good. I got the country friend steak and it was delish. Great value for your money. The only reason I gave 4/5 stars was because they crammed 5 of us into a table that I think should have been for max 4 people. Especially because everyone gets so much food you all need more than one plate! But maybe that's a good problem? Overall, still very satisfied and can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"I used to love Cracker Barrel - but since living in Central Phoenix, I haven't been to one in ages so since I was passing through, I decided to dine for breakfast.  A great perk about Cracker Barrel is that they have a store full of cute nic nacs and you can be shopping around while you wait for a table. During holiday season, they have adorable ornaments and I purchased a few to spice up my  tree.

When we finally got to a table, we ordered the chicken fried chicken with hashbrown casserole, overmedium eggs, and a maine blueberry pancake with blueberry syrup.  Once we got our order, I bit into the chicken and it tasted stale.  The hashbrown casserole was good, eggs are usually always good, and the pancake was ok.  Now that I've been exposed to the better breakfast restaurants in Phoenix, this place just doesn't do it for me anymore.

I was quite disappointed. The place was packed with people - and I used to remember thinking that it was because of the \"great\" food.  Now I am just thinking it's probably one of the best breakfast joints in this area. Besides, who wants to drive half an hour away if you live in Chandler to somewhere else only to be waiting for another hour? I am so glad I live in Central Phoenix because this place will not pop up on my 3 mile proximity radar."}

{"text":"Had the fried shrimp platter w/ mixed veggies, steak fries & mashed potatoes.
Satisfying but a little stale on the shrimp and fries. Mashed potatoes we're delicious, creamy. Good overall. But I wouldn't really come here by choice. Great service though waitress was very kind made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I don't normally review \"chains\" and this is technically a chain however, there are none of these in California.  Let's see, here's a story, a few years ago I became enamored with this place called Cracker Barrel.  I had heard so much about it and I love anything Southern so it was my goal to go to one of these for several years. I had been in Florida, Texas and AZ before all states that have a CB but unfortunately never got the opportunity to go to one.  So when I found out I'd be coming to Arizona this past weekend, the first thing I did was look up to see where the nearest Cracker Barrel was going to be. Lucky for me there was one very close to where we were staying so I told my friend that we HAD to go eat there at some point in the weekend.

That point was this past Sunday for breakfast.  I was a bit nervous because I had hyped CB for so many years that I hoped it lived up to it.  My friend even made fun of me when I told her she was helping to make one of my \"dreams come true\" (a little over dramatic yes but whatever).  Well I can safely say that once we were done with our meal she bit her tongue on what she said to me and she bit it hard.

We were seated pretty quickly for a Sunday morning, our server was very nice and he won extra points with us because he showed us his wallet which was an old California Angels wallet (we were in AZ because of Spring Training).  Everything on the menu looked so good but I finally settled on the French Toast Breakfast w/blackberry topping (it came with eggs and bacon as well).  My friend couldn't decide what she wanted but she knew she wanted have the hashbrown casserole.  Our waiter recommended something that was off the menu for her and it was perfect 3 pancakes, hashbrown casserole, bacon and sausage.

When our food came out our eyes just lit up.  My french toast was AMAZING.  The tartness from the blackberry just made the combination so so good. The bacon was also very crispy just the way I like it.  The showstopper though had to be the hashbrown casserole.  My friend had me try it and it was seriously unlike anything I had ever tasted before.  We're trying to recreate this ourselves.  The bill wasn't bad at all for the amount of food you got (it was under $8 per plate) definitely worth it. Like I said it definitely lived up to my own hype.

With that said: Dear Cracker Barrel, please franchise to southern California please please pretty please!! Luckily for us we are going back to AZ at the end of the month and we have already decided we are stopping here again!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was okay not spectacular but OK. The atmosphere was light and cheery a great place to take the family."}
{"text":"The place was very clean and friendly. Very family orientated....The food was spectacular! The veggies were so tasty as well as the roast beef! The prices were great and I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"We are Las Vegans and had lunch here today as we were downtown on an errand.  What a mistake!  Terrible food, mediocre service and if people visiting from out of town are thinking this is a great, quick stop for a bite to eat, think again!  There are so many other places in our town to eat, I am surprised this particular place is still open!  Never to return....NOT EVER!"}
{"text":"We stopped at the bass pro shop on thev way out of town to meet some friends. When we saw the cracker barrel across the parking lot we thought it would be a great place to have breakfast before or drive back to the OC.  My friends are from the area and said we could go online and get put on the wait list which gave us 30 minutes to look around bass. When we arrived we checked in and were told we were next to be seated and to proceed to the next desk. I end up being about the 6th to be seated. When she walked us to our table we had to stop in front of the fireplace because our table was still being cleaned. The place is very busy with a lot of people running around. A table seem to be in an awkward position that made my friend feel like he was dodging some trays. The orders were taken fast but the food took some time to come out. I had the old timers with hash browns and turkey sausage. My friend ordered the double meat and asked if he could have hash browns instead of grits. The answer was no but he could order and pay for a side of hash browns. When our food came, they put one point between us that held two biscuits one bowl of gravy and one bowl of grits. Both males were supposed to come with grits I thought but I didn't want to have to look at a menu again. And I didn't see any jam preserves. My meal was mediocre. Sausage was ok. I put it between my dry biscuit to make a slider. The hash browns casserole had cheese and lots of onions and was kinda mushy. My over medium eggs were over easy.  Cute place. Lots to look at. Our waitress was nice and friendly butv when she poured the coffee she missed both our cups before getting it in the cup. Lol. Anyway, if your with the family...good loud place where your kids screaming may blend in. The fried chicken looked amazing! Lots of parking! Do the online wait list to save some time."}
{"text":"March 9, 2018, my husband and I went to this Cracker Barrel for our usual Friday breakfast. His French toast was tough and dry and hard to eat, and my hash brown casserole tasted like something you get out of a freezer. We we very disappointed in the meal, but our server was very nice as usual. We will continue to go to Cracker Barrel but may start going to other locations until the kinks are worked out."}
{"text":"You seriously can't beat the chicken pot pie and biscuits lunch special for 5 dollars on Wednesdays. Let me repeat. Delicious Cracker Barrel chicken pot pie. Biscuits. 5 dollars. Husband got a sausage and eggs breakfast that he liked a lot. This restaurant is busy (I mean, they all are) so it can take a while to get seated, and the service can be lacking sometimes. But that's okay. It's Cracker Barrel. Nothing can go wrong!"}
{"text":"We like the food at Cracker Barrel and the service is usually good. The one issue we always seem to have is if we order salads it takes forever to get them and then food is out 5 minutes later. We have even tried not putting in the rest of our order until we have gotten our salads but we are still eating our salads when it comes out. Just our pet peeve."}
{"text":"Visiting from California for 4 days and I have eaten here 3 times! Needless to say, the food is great! I ordered the rib eye steak and it was perfectly seasoned and cooked exactly as I asked. My husband had the chicken fried chicken.  The gravy on the chicken was flavorful and creamy. Now the biscuits. .the biscuits are to die for! Warm, light and fluffy! 

We came in the next day just to order breakfast. The pancakes yummy!..a llittle crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. With just a little bit of butter..thats all it needed

From the hostess that seated us to our server, they were very personable and welcoming. Not to mention our order was exactly as requested.  Anytime I see a cracker barrel you can be sure I will be stopping!"}
{"text":"Good food. Bad service. Disappointed with lack of attention and service in resturant maybe an off day for server ??? . However had a great person help me in the store as I was purchasing a few items."}
{"text":"When I first arrived, I went to the ladies room first, where an employee was texting in the middle of the room, left when I went into a stall, and was still texting in the alcove when I came out. I went up to the hostess stand, no one was there for a couple minutes. Turns out the texting employee was the hostess. Well, at least she has her priorities straight! I've come to this Cracker Barrel a few times over the years. It is consistently inconsistent. I got the fried chicken tenderloins with hash brown casserole and dumplings. The dumplings get an A+, they were actually hot for a change. The hash brown casserole was not hot and was kind of crusty and probably not from today. The chicken tenders were fine. The waitress, P'Harris, was just doing her job, no enthusiasm whatsoever."}
{"text":"5 star for any Cracker Barrel on the West Coast!

i was on my way back to LA and I didn't even know that they had a Cracker Barrel in the West.  Having lived in the East Coast for a few years I enjoyed the meat loaf and then some snacks at the shop.

I spent $50 here just on snack, buying the cream soda and candies for my boys."}
{"text":"I have been to plenty of cracker barrels I absolutely love their food and service no complaints there but I agree with the other reviews on this specific location it is quite dirty ..... The bathroom was horrible I couldn't believe it was cracker barrel"}
{"text":"Terrible service...way too many waitors-waitresses to wait 15 mins and not even get a glass of water. Never mind the fact that the hostess walked by THREE TIMES, tried to make eye contact but she looked the other way. Two other waitresses walked right by us. We got up and left ...NEVER coming back!"}
{"text":"The food tasted fine, but the portions were mighty small. I had over medium eggs and biscuits. The wait was not worth the food, that's for sure. Nothing memorable to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE!!! You wait an hour to be seated and an hour to get your food, only to be disappointed.  My son's order was wrong.....no communication between the server and terrible waitress. The rest of his food came 15 minutes later and everyone else was done eating. 
The food is not all it's CRACKED up to be. Save your money and go to IHOP!"}
{"text":"First visit to Cracker Barrel... The BEST gift store, ever!! Hospitality was great, like we all know, half of the pleasure of dining out is hospitality! Shout out to our server, Vicky! Food was good, I would definitely go back! Ambiance was very comfortable! Prices are family friendly. #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Me and my friends visited this CB on Thanksgiving morning for the first time (in life) and we like it. We talked abt having breakfast for long time and we finally made it on thanksgiving day. 

We arrived and the whole parking lot was  jam-packed. We enter through their front door and we felt like it was a store. For a second we thought this must be a store and we just didn't know it, my friend even went out to look at the sign and that's when he saw the restaurant section on the side.

We had to wait for little while since it was the Thanksgiving day but once we were seated, it was all good. The service was pretty good and all of us enjoyed their food. 

We will be back for sure ;)"}
{"text":"One of my top 3 all time favorite places to eat at. Great service, great food, and great value. Can't beat Cracker Barrel no matter where you are!"}
{"text":"Menu changed! No more delicious single patty 1/2 lb. bacon cheeseburger on a toasted large bun. Now it's a double patty on a small bun leaving a greasy splotch on your plate and in your mouth. Tasted blah as the meat vendor must have changed. Not the same. Whomever made this change must not of sampled the product. This was a corporate change going the wrong way. 
Normally my wife and I can always count on CB to have consistent quality, but not in this case. Yuck. Don't waste your $10 on this item."}
{"text":"Love their food specially the fried chicken and biscuits and gravy, raspberry tea is out of this world, best tea I've ever had also our waiter Linda is the best always has our drinks ready she makes the overall experience the best she's the only person I let serve us"}
{"text":"Service sucked. Food was better than I have had at Cracker Barrel in the past. It was Friday so I had the fried chicken! Super awesome! Pepper fried goodness! 

Server couldn't answer my questions and made me feel like an idot for asking! Um I'm from Cali and we don't get the pleasure is eating here in a regular basis! 

If sweet potato casserole is available-get it! 

Kids shrimp is a lot of shrimp and crispy pepper breaded since I didn't get the correct answer I thought I'd share with y'all!"}
{"text":"This morning I had not had a chance to eat breakfeast before I dropped my girlfriend off at work.  Snow was pouring down, and that old country store evoked a relaxed calm emotion within me.

Kind of strange really, its only a chain food joint! (maybe it was the snow)

anyway, I walked in, was seated within moments, order taken, and served shortly thereafter.

I think when you go to place like this, you SHOULD know what to expect.  I recieved what I expected.....Good service, food, and on my way!

Not any more, not any less"}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for dinner on our 11 hour lay over in Charlotte.  I'm giving it a 4 star because I wasn't expecting anything when we arrived but was delighted to get a very nice serving of their Campfire Beef.  My friend ordered the Campfire Chicken and it came with 1/2 a chicken!  Needless to say we were stuffed and didn't finish our dishes or eat the side of fried apples we ordered.  The service was a bit slow but I think they were understaffed that Sunday night.  Oh and the store is great if you want to purchase random nostalgic items like Mad Lib or rock candy."}
{"text":"Ok, so I guess no matter how many times I have seen one of these restaurants pop up on my searches for breakfast, I have never gone. This time, it was just the best option. So, when we walked right into this cute funky store with all kinds of knick knacks, I was a little surprised. The store and restaurant on the inside look like an old barn with great southern antiques and the like all over. There are lanterns for lights and the place has a neat feel to it.

We were seated quickly and the restaurant was quite crowded. We were conveniently seated near some baseball photos and antiques. Our waitress came by quickly to let us know she would be with us in a few minutes and then came to take our drink orders. COFFEE! After a 430 am awakening, it was well needed. The menu had a lot of things on it and the prices were CHEAP. The options were not so creative, but very southern and hearty. 

We ordered the Old Timer Breakfast and the Mamas Pancake Special. The Old Timer came with 2 eggs, grits, biscuits and gravy, turkey sausage, and fried apples (which the waitress told me are baked with cinnamon and lots of sugar... probably butter too seeing the calories.) The Mamas Pancake dish came with pancakes, which we substituted blueberry pancakes, bacon, and eggs. It seemed like it took about 30 minutes for our breakfast to come. We did get frequent coffee refills, but we were starving and it just plane took forever. 

Finally, it all came and we dug in. We were just starving and over coffee'd by this point. I was overly enthusiastic about my grits and gobbled them down with a little sweetener. Standard grits, but they were good by me. The apples were good, but nothing to write home about for less than a cup of apples with gooey sauce for 184 calories. I did like my turkey sausage patty, but gave the second one to SG. SG's pancakes were just ok, but it was a nice touch that they offered sugar free syrup as well as blueberry.

Overall, it hit the spot because we were hungry. But, if there is a better reviewed location anywhere we are looking for a meal, we will likely go there. This place is just average, but very very CHEAP. My plate was only $6.39 (grits, eggs, apples, sausage, 2 biscuits and gravy). The servings are HUGE for the price. So if you are looking for quantity over quality, this is your place. Nothing too creative, just lots of it."}
{"text":"I love the Cracker Barrel. The food is amazing, the service is always great, and the prices are reasonable. I love the country store and the country feel. We don't have one in Cali so I make sure to hit a CB any time I see one!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cracker Barrel countless times over the years, and never had such poor service and food. Breakfast of all things? Eggs undercooked, cold, and had to send it back. Second time around, food cold again... Enough already. No management concern ... Go to Bob Evans, First Watch --within a minute you can be somewhere else. So not recommend this store. For the record - I never ever complain ... But this was unacceptable."}
{"text":"I got the chicken and dumplings with fried okra. The okra was okay, but the chicken and dumplings were really bland. It was super busy, so with that taken into consideration the service was adequate."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are from san diego and were in Peoria for the WBC and spring training. We flew in Friday morning and were staying right across from Cracker Barrel at the holiday inn. We were excited to see a cute place to eat so close to us. We both love breakfast so decided to check it out. I got the old timer breakfast which was delicious and the bf got a 2 egg and bacon plate with some toast which he really enjoyed. The hash brown casserole was amazing!!! (I consider myself a hash brown expert). We decided to come back again on Sunday morning before our we left and the food didn't disappoint. It was nice being able to go some where out of town and having a nice meal and good service to go along with it. Well definitely be back to the Cracker Barrel when were in Peoria next year."}
{"text":"Fireplace and breakfast anytime. Could not be happier. The place even had that wood burning campfire smell. Staff was friendly. I had a late breakfast and the eggs were perfect. The ham was fabulous."}
{"text":"I had not been to a Cracker Barrel in quite awhile, so I was hopeful despite the mediocre reviews for this restaurant. Unfortunately, the place deserves only mediocre reviews. We were seated promptly, but things went downhill from there.  When we ordered our meals, the waiter repeatedly had to tell us the items we ordered were \"not available\". My mom ordered an apple-chicken salad-the salad did not match the menu description. Waiter was nice, but was harried and seemed pretty inexperienced.  It's quite a noisy place with lots of families. Overall, it was a disappointing experience. I won't be visiting a Cracker Barrel again if I can help it."}
{"text":"I've been to other Cracker Barrels.  Most are decent food and service worth at least 3 stars.  This Las Vegas location was extremely disappointing, even compared to others of the same franchise.

The wait times are long which is pretty normal for this chain.  There is a system that allows you to put your name on the waitlist online ahead of time to reduce the time spent once there.
The greeter had a fake smile and no warmth to her at all.  She gave us grossly inaccurate wait times, stating 90 minutes when it was about 20 minutes and had a self-satisfied smirk as we discussed whether we should go somewhere else.

The waitress was friendly but not particularly enthusiastic about her job.  She got several components of the order wrong and had to be reminded a few times.  A manager or supervisor came around to check on the tables which was appreciated but really didn't do enough to overcome other issues.

The food is always the most important component and was an abject failure.  Nearly every component of the food served was inadequate.  Eggs over easy came over medium and over hard.  The buttermilk biscuits were underbaked and we had to bring them home and put them in the toaster oven for 5 minutes to fix them.  The gravy and sausage was somewhat bland.  The cheesy hash brown potatos were not cooked all the way and the potatoes were still somewhat raw.  They were again better after microwaving at home for a few minutes.  The pancakes were about the only success and one of there better items.  They had crispy edges and a pleasant caramlized taste. 

There are far better options for breakfast in Las Vegas.  I will avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"The wait time is an hour on a Monday around 10:30 for breakfast. He store area is too crowded to walk around. They finally call your name to come up front to wait another 10 mins. They walk you to the eating area to wait for the table to be cleaned. Then you get seated finally. 

Pretty friendly service from Uleysys as our waiter. 

1 star for Poor process in seating people."}
{"text":"First off, I'm an extremely patient person.  But upon entering this Cracker Barrel, we stood in like for 5 mins, with over 10 people accumulating behind us.

The gentleman in front then asked a waitress, if anyone there was going to help us.

She went and found the hostess, in the BOH, and she began seating us all.  Before she gets to us, the manager comes by, sees all of us standing, and proceeds to go mess with the purses!!!  No apologies, or offers to seat us. Speechless.

Then, we get to our seat, in a nearly empty restaurant.  My husband and I were giggling and playing the triangle game, and no one comes to greet us.  The people say after us got drinks and an order put in.  Still haven't been greeted.  

At this point, we decide to walk out and leave.  There were STILL people standing in line, and we were just appalled.  

We went to the Outback right across the intersection and got MUCH better service.

As a prior server, this is a breakdown of service excellence and management.  I sincerely hope Cracker Barrel gets a hold of the reins here, because it's one of my favorite restaurants over the whole US."}
{"text":"NASTY!!!! If you are from the south and have been to cracker barrel at home, DONT EAT HERE!!! It is nothing like home. Its crowded, dirty, noisey, lousey service shoving folks in and out like pigs, and the food sucks. I went through 4 sets of dirty silverware before i decided to use my hand to pick at my salad. Then became grossed out because the tables are so crammed in and close  together, every time my waitress helps the next table her whole ass is literally on mine next to my salad.
This is a place for tourists to say \"been there\". It is  a half step down from the $hit you get at a buffet on the strip..... any buffet.... i mean any one just pick one and see.."}
{"text":"Always love coming to the Cracker Barrel. The food, service, and ambiance are always great. Of course we lose the girls in the country store. Surprised to learn that they will ship anything you purchase for free. We have been stuffing suitcases because we stopped at other locations before going home.

The food is really good. The best day to go is Sunday when they have their fried chicken special but as a vegan I ended up with a sweet potato, spiced apples & a kale salad/coleslaw that was very tasty. All my family was like \"is that all your going to eat \" but it was a lot of food and I left the restaurant stuffed. And while everything was super tasty, it wasn't fried chicken. Still getting used to this vegan life. I do feel great though so I am happy about my decision.

Jane our waitress was very friendly and our waters, coffee and ice teas never got passed the halfway mark and that was with the fact that today was super busy.

If you are ever by a Cracker Barrel, make sure you get to visit. This one is a good one!"}
{"text":"Definitely a solid 2 stars - unfortunately.  I was very excited to try Cracker Barrel because a lot of my FB friends raved about it.  All the food was very underwhelming.

ATMOSPHERE
The establishment is very cute.  I loved all of the decorations they had.  It was all very rustic and really encompasses the epitome of what I imagine a cabin in the country would look like.  I loved it.  It's the reason why I gave this place 2 stars.

CUSTOMER SERVICE
Customer service was great.  From the hostess to the servers, they do a good job to make you feel welcome and a good job taking care of you. 

FOOD
I ordered the EGG SANDWICH and the BISCUITS & GRAVY WITH BACON.  The sandwich was fine.  I ordered my eggs over medium and it was cooked perfectly.  The yolk was a little runny, but all the whites were cooked through.  Runny whites remind me of snot.  Gross!  The sandwich comes with the eggs (2), a few slices of tomato, and mayo on sourdough bread.  It was good.  Especially because I added the bacon that came with my biscuits and gravy to it. SO GOOD!  Except, I like my bacon chewy rather than crispy - which is how they make their bacon there - crispy.  

The BISCUITS & GRAVY was very underwhelming.  The gravy was very bland, and the biscuits, although cooked well, were good, but nothing memorable.  Even after adding salt to the gravy, it still didn't fix it.  I feel like it needed more sausage or something.

My friend ordered the SAMPLER PLATTER which came with eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, grits, and biscuits and gravy.  I tried the sausage and it had good flavor, but was overcooked and VERY dry.  The ham was overly salty.  The grits were bland... Not sure if it was supposed to be that way, but, it wasn't pleasant. Even after adding some butter. 

OVERALL
For the first time trying this place, I definitely wasn't wow'd.  I'm not sure what people were raving about because the food that was served to us was sub par.  Sorry, Cracker Barrel, I definitely will NOT be a returning customer."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I will not be returning the service was horrible we had to wait 45 minutes for our food and the bathroom was very messy I will not be returning don't not come here unless you want horrible service"}
{"text":"What can I say. It is consistently okay. The service is great just not my cup of tea. I prefer made to order food but will eat at places like these when I am out of town. Enough said."}
{"text":"Don't know how many Cracker Barrels I've been to, but as I've said before, I'll five-star CB once I can dine at a location in Southern California. 

I came to this one with my mom, J, my cousin, her husband, their three kids (ages 7, 3, and 6mos), my aunt, and uncle. We ended up having two servers waiting on us; one for each half of the table. Can't recall what everyone got, just know that we all ate 98% of what we ordered. Everything is always so good! The lemonade hit the spot like no other. 
I can't remember our servers' names and I feel bad about that; they were both super friendly and helpful. Someone made the mistake of giving me access to both the breakfast and lunch / dinner menus. I was overwhelmed by all the possible yumminess to be had, and the one server had to come back to me a couple times. She was all kinds of patient with me. 

After we ate, I walked around the shop with my mom since this was her first time at a Cracker Barrel. 
I need their Solo Cup lights, stat."}
{"text":"I love coming here best food ever I would recommend coming here Sunday for the chicken dinner so good"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! The food is awesome, the cornbread is wonderful, and the ice tea is fresh brewed. My wife loves the carrots and the green beans remind me of those family Sunday dinners back home."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Tuesday morning for breakfast in recognition of hubby making it to another birthday.

On special this morning was the stuffed lemon blueberry French toast which hubby didn't hesitate to order.  It also comes with eggs and a meat and overall he enjoyed it with the exception he felt the French toast could have been hotter.  He suspected that it comes prepared and the cook just has to heat it up.

However, our server, Lori, did a great job for us on a weekday when we were both rushed to get to work.  Although we don't go out for breakfast often on a weekday, we remembered her and were pleased she was serving this morning.  She kept our coffee cups full, made sure we were happy with our order and dropped off our bill with the food so we could pay at our convenience.  Service like this easily makes up for French toast that isn't piping hot.

My birthday is still several months away, but we'll probably plan on a weekday breakfast on that day as well!"}
{"text":"Why in the world did they make this location a \"West Coast model\"? It's so crowded! Did they not think people would come here? It's not enjoyable at all. 
I've been eating at Cracker Barrel for 10 years all over the South. Great food, roomy and pleasant atmosphere. But this location is a hot, noisy mess. 
Food was ok, not great. I felt like I was sitting at one gigantic community table.
So we are back driving to Kingman. I'd rather drive than wait for 1.5 hours to eat locally for sub par food."}
{"text":"AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!! This place gives Cracker Barrel an AWFUL name!
We should have known when we walked in the place & only 4 tables had people. They completely ran out of the daily special which was turkey and dressing. That should be a no brainer as far as making enough for a daily special...but they also had no meatloaf or roast as well. We told the manager and she had no clue about managing staff much less a restaurant. Do yourself a favor & go up the road to another restaurant!"}
{"text":"Was on break from work and decided to stop in for lunch. Wait to be seated wasn't too long but all downhill after that. Table next to us complained immediately after we sat down that there food did not arrive correctly or not at all. Should have left then but instead waited 15 minutes and no one approached our table. Complained to the manager on the way out and he looked at us like he didn't really care. He did muster up he would cover our meal if we would stay but by then 20 minutes of our lunch hour was waisted. Went down the road for lunch."}
{"text":"The once in a great while visit to Cracker Barrel has again hit the spot! This place is awesome and today we had the pleasure to be served by Courtney who has done a great job. Thank you Courtney for making this an awesome start of a morning for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Place was busy but there were open tables and we were seated right away. Got our coffee and ordered. It took 40 minutes to get our food. Ordered the Western Omelette and it came with no meat.  I was told it had ham and bacon. Coffee was weak. Server was nice and apologetic but it took way too long to get our food."}
{"text":"We were here 6 months ago & had a ZERO STARS EXPERIENCE - however we were pleased to dine here again a week ago & had a great time and exceptional food! The pecan pancakes are pretty amazing! And the hash brown casserole I couldnt get enough of ... SO CHEESY!!!!! Yum! My husband went for dinner options; greens, pot roast, mashed potatoes & he enjoyed it but the serving sizes were super small to him. I love shopping in the store! We stock up on the pancake mix so we can have pancakes in between visits because we cant get to Vegas weekly LOL. old time candies galore & country inspired knick knacks - a city girl's dreams! Haaaaaaa!!!! Grab grub @ Cracker Barrel you guys - good stuff"}
{"text":"An industry leader for a reason.  Great attention by staff, moves fast and always busy, great food, gift shop worth a trip in itself,  unbelievable attention to customers, you need directions, whatever they are there to help. The desserts ! Even some healthful options. If a manager does not say hello, the kitchen must clearly be on fire."}
{"text":"The wait times alone of this place are enough to warrant a negative review.  I've been here 3 times now on 3 different occasions at different times and it's always minimum of an hour wait.  Just an overcrowded cesspool of people.  I don't even come here on my own accord, it's because friends and family want to come here.  The food is somewhat decent, but they just don't have any respect for people's times at all.  Today we did the online checkin and low and behold still another hour wait.  Just a horrible way to run a business.  It makes people wait in the store because it's too cold outside so that you get suckered into buying more stuff.  This is officially one of those places I will just avoid at all cost!!  Yelpers, you have been fairly warned."}
{"text":"I use to eat at Cracker Barrels all over the country in my travels and really enjoyed them.

However, I have been to this location twice with different people and it was not the best experience.  

I usually get the pot roast dinner and it was very fatty, the muffins were dry, and the service was average.

I also ate breakfast there and when I received the bacon, it was cold, not good \"since I'm a meat and potatoes\" guy and grew up in the Midwest.

Would I recommend this location, absolutely not.  Much work to do to bring it up to the standard that we the customer deserves and I know they can provide.

Hit a casino buffet, you cant go wrong!"}
{"text":"It's hard to screw up breakfast, and my previous visits to other Cracker Barrels endorsed this.  But on my visit to the Cracker Barrel in Glendale AZ yesterday, our server was Ramon.  He was cheerful, pleasant, and really seemed to enjoy his job, explaining the various dishes and their various permutations to my curious dining partner without a hint of condescension or impatience.

Well done, Ramon!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"All in all service was good, especially considering it was Easter Sunday. only a 30 min wait (expected). Worst part was after 10 min at our table and no drink order taken. I looked around to find a manager standing there jaw jacking with a server. 

Now, my table was the closest table to where they were standing. To look around a busy restaurant and find a Manager standing around flapping his gums, is unexceptable. Having to ask him if someone could take our drink order didn't even spur him into action. Well he did catch someone walking by and ask them to do it.

Nice deligation dork! How about doing something besides hold the floor down?! 

Other than a laxidasical approach to Mgmt, things were good. Service was good once she arrived. She checked on us multiple times. The food was as good as pancakes and eggs could be.

I just don't like to see the leader standing around while everone else is busting their butt. Poor Management."}
{"text":"CB on Independence has lost it's MOJO? 

ALL CB tend to be predictable - good food, service at a fair price. 

Not so much last night? Ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Chicken Fried Chicken both solid dishes at The Barrel. Guess what, we were delivered both meals NAKED as they had RUN OUT OF SAUSAGE GRAVY! Oh and those usually savory sweet carrots, they had been on the back burner ALL DAY and were now only tasteless orange mush. 

Say what, a southern restaurant chain out of sausage gravy suggesting that they were substituting brown gravy? 

After pitching a fit, they made some white gravy to accompany our meal.

Service was friendly but only \"adequate\" as she couldn't keep our drinks full? 

No manager in sight, damage done and moving the Independence location to the NEVER \"do over\" list..."}
{"text":"Good food kids loved the mac n cheese as well as the chicken over rice.  Downhome good food and nice wait staff."}
{"text":"Very happy there is a cracker barrel in Las Vegas...problem, the service was terrible!  My waitress flat out lied to me about bread being available and she was Mia most of the time. Oh well still good food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to many cracker barrels, and this one is probably one of the least of my favorite locations. The service is sometimes erratic, and they don't include some things during lunch or dinner like other Cracker Barrels. Other than that, the food is still on point."}
{"text":"40 min breakfast wait... why don't they do reservations ... why! While waiting 40 mins I found myself playing checkers. Then browsing the store buying up everything... okay on to the food. I got black berry French toast with bacon and eggs and home fries. Ummm yum! Great service too! The ladies were very pleasant to me. And tended to all of my needs and wants."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Cracker Barrel restaurants for years and always enjoy the southern food. This location I visit the most and have always received great service. The only issue recently was that I noticed that our plates were dirty. Like dried food stuck to the bottoms and sides of the plates. This happened not once, but the last few times that I have been. I first complained to the manager, who was very nice, but the problem did not get taken care of. I visited their website and let them know about what was going on. Apparently there was a dish washing issue that needed to be addressed. The corporate office called to apologize and sent me a coupon for two free complete meals. Very nice gesture, and much appreciated. 

We went back recently to use the coupon for breakfast, there seemed to be improvement, at least on this day. I am glad because I freakin love their catfish !!!"}
{"text":"I had to convince my boyfriend to go here because he thought the food would be boring and bland. By the time we left, he was smiling ear to ear! 

I got my usual dish of meatloaf with turnip greens and a side salad, but decided on French fries instead of mashed potatoes. The turnip greens were a bit blander than normal (could have used some salt & pepper or other spices) but everything else was spot on.

I also was given a plate with a biscuit & a corn muffin. The corn muffin was a bit dry but my boyfriend enjoyed the biscuit very much.

He got the crispy chicken BLT sandwich and was blown away. He went crazy for the macaroni & cheese and said it was super cheesy and delicious. He also loved the small side of coleslaw, which was fresh, tangy, & still crunchy! 

You will not leave hungry at Cracker Barrel. Most entree dishes come with your choice of three sides and a biscuit, and the long list of homemade sides bears something for everyone. The kids will love it, the elderly will definitely love it, and it is just a fun, unique every time. 

Also, you will almost never leave without finding something neat in the gift shop. They always have at least one display of 70% off, which is where you'll find me! ;)"}
{"text":"Having moved from the West Coast, I first experienced Cracker Barrel only a few years ago.  We have been several times since, and have generally come to see it as \"comfort food haven\".  When you are looking for a good breakfast, or a homey dinner, it really fits the bill.

The place was slammed the last time we were there (about 10 minutes after we were seated, a whole tour bus arrived to an already busy restaurant), but from the service we received, you absolutely could not tell.  She was friendly, personable, efficient, and prompt.  Great job.

I think it is fun to walk through the shop while you are waiting to be called for your table, and even though a lot of the merchandise is a bit cheesy, the prices really aren't as bad as you would imagine for a gift-shop.

A note for parents: they have the best booster seats I have ever seen.  It is basically a wooden youth chair, complete with arms, but without legs.  It is strapped securely by a heavy leather strap to their chair.  Anyone who has ever used one of the injection molded plastic boosters in a chair can appreciate this simple improvement.  No worrying that they are going to lean wrong and fall right out of the chair!  They also have a peg game at each table that everyone in my family (down to the 3yo (who can't play it \"right\" but still loves to move the pegs) loves to pass the time with."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times,  first time was ok, this time the food was a little better.  Our service was very slow but we did have a large group of 10 so I can understand the time issue.  It took a very long time for the food to arrive and it wasn't that busy but our waitress Hailey seemed new but was very good,  I felt bad because she needed help but still managed to get the job done.  My other issue was when the food came out they brought an extra plate of food we didn't order, a different waitress brought it and put it down, when we told her we didn't order it she said \"just keep it anyway, don't worry about it because if it goes back they will just throw it away\".  Then the check came and sure enough it was billed to us but when we told Hailey she made sure it was deleted.   Food quality was good,  portions were bigger than last time as well.  All in all not too bad experience."}
{"text":"I went for Breakfast and can say the food was absolutely terrible. I ordered the country fried steak with over easy eggs, biscuits and gravy with grits. The fried steak was awful and tasted metallic same as the gravy. I would not be surprised if the gravy came from a can. The eggs were cooked properly but not seasoned. The grits were bland and not seasoned as well. The service did not make up at all for the lack of the food quality. Our server did not smile and took our order incorrectly, twice. Never apologized for making a mistake just saying \"oh\" when it was brought to her attention. 

This restaurant is over hyped and a disappointment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get breakfast. The chicken tenders are my favorite thing and are available for breakfast or dinner. Only giving four stars because the eggs do tend to be undercooked quite a bit and sometimes the service isn't the best. Overall a good place to get a large and cheap breakfast meal."}
{"text":"Never again.  Last year I had ordered the Thanksgiving dinner that fed 6-8 people, and we really had liked it, and so did our guests.
This year, I couldn't believe it.  Spent over $75.00, and there were a total of 9 slices of turkey, biscuits were burnt on the bottom, quart size containers, which by the way, I had ordered an extra one of Mac and Cheese which is $8.99 additional, and they weren't even filled to the top!
But not only were we disappointed in this years meal, we have noticed that the quality and quantity of the food in this restaurant has gone down hill tremendously.  Smaller amounts and higher prices.
Service is also not the same, like it used to be.
It's just not the same anymore here.
I used to love going here, but now I will pass and next year I will make my own Thanksgiving dinner at home, and it will probably be a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"There are few things I dislike more than crowds and snowbirds. Cracker Barrel has both in force! The kids love this place. We cave every so often for their benefit.

Let's start with there always being a 20+ minute wait. Then you have to dodge snowbirds, children and merchandise in the hoarder-style, overfilled Country Store. I feel like I'm in Pac man trying to get to breakfast while being blocked by ghosts and Yankee candle displays. 

I get to my table, which have the hardest, wobbly wooden chairs ever. The tables have so much junk on top we can never fit the food (or beat the peg game). My drink is slow to get refilled, and I've rarely had a visit when something in the order is not missing. And for crying out loud, I want the breakfast menu. Does anyone in their right mind want the dinner menu here?

Then after your meal, you reverse your way through the maze to pay your bill. Holy moly people, take my money so I can get the rock out of here! The ghosts are chasing me again, this time out to the parking lot where a hundred snowbirds impatiently wait on the walk in rocking chairs with their oxygen tanks, playing checkers."}
{"text":"Second time to this location and the wait was reduced by checking in online, however that was negated once we placed our order and ended up waiting over an hour because the kitchen was backed up apparently. Will probably find a different place to eat next time... food was not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"Love love love!! Sara was amazing freindly as can be made you feel like u were at home!!!!"}
{"text":"This rating is based on the service.  The food is wonderful and I will return for it.  The service is wow, bad.  We ordered drinks and I got iced tea my Mother got sweet tea and my Father got raspberry lemonade.  We had to flag someone down because the lemonade had no ice and was warm. I ordered the sunrise platter.  With is comes the fried apples and the hashbrown casserole.  The two other people in my party ordered diner plates and had the fried apples as sides.  As we are being serviced the server sets down the two dinner plates then mine as soon as it is in front of me he reaches to take the apples off my plate and says you don't get those, they belong to one of the dinner plates.  I tell him no I get them as well.  He says you don't but okay.  We start to eat and I notice I have no hashbrown casserole.  I flag down someone again, because I never see out server.  I explain about the meal and what it comes with and she (Kattie) tells me she will get it fixed.  A few minutes later out comes a lady in a navy blue shirt who states \"I was told to bring this here\"  she then states they never tell her why to see a table.  She does ask if there is anything else she can do, but quite frankly she did not seem to interested and I wanted to enjoy my meal so I just said that was all.  We enjoy our meal and as the server finally checks on us to clear our plates and offer refills on our drinks, that have been empty since the middle of the meal.  I says no refills, we are done.  He places the check on the table and leaves.  We were going to order dessert to go, but no way!  I know his name was Aaron and the most helpful person there and a true asset was Kattie.  Huge thank you to Kattie for all you did."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal or experience The Cracker Barrel.   love the fact that you can be on the road and stop for a yummy home cooked style meal.
always a favorite for the family and do have to admit I like looking around the store too."}
{"text":"Our family really wanted to enjoy this place. But in the end, it wasn't that good. Let me say that the staff is very friendly. And everything was served in fairly good timing. But the food really wasn't that good. Biggest disappointment was my wife's roast beef dinner. Very little beef. Plate was 80% side dishes. And the beef itself was the same quality as a frozen TV dinner. I had the rib eye. The most expensive dish on the menu. It was average. My daughter's country fried steak was probably the best of all the dishes. Two of us ordered fried apple chips as our side. What we got was apple pie filling without the crust. It was actually good, but just not what was advertised. I know that this location is new. I'm all for giving a place a second chance, if I think it's just growing pains that they are going thru. But truthfully, I think what we got is most likely what it's going to be. And that being the case, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was great the food was really good service was great also. It was very busy but the server didn't have you waiting for anything. The kids can play checkers while you wait to be seated. I would recommend this place and will be going here again."}
{"text":"I read here that the breakfast is good, but I've only ever eaten dinner there...twice. Not my choice though after the first time. The food was like the school cafeteria lunches. The green beans were straight from the can. I would expect fresh green beans for those prices. Also, all the other food seemed way over-cooked and very cafeteria quality. Most of it was clearly pre-cooked from the Costco frozen food section, then microwaved and put on our plates. If I go out to eat, I don't want the same stuff I can get from a can at home."}
{"text":"From the moment I stepped into Cracker Barrel, I was overwhelmed with the feeling of Christmas. The gift shop was filled with deals, so I took advantage of it! When we waited for our table, near the enormous fireplace, the warmth of the fire warmed me throughout. Our server, Ian C., was awesome! He checked on us multiple times & was so nice. The food arrived quickly & everything tasted so great. The bill didn't make me flinch either!! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast at dinner time, my moms favorite restaurants! Hmmm ok the good! I had five eggs made to perfection, and the grits where also great. 
The ok, the bacon was good and cooked just right. The IDK, the sausage patties were edible but not something I would order again, and I don't know if the sausage gravy was really sausage gravy????"}
{"text":"Good food.....Very busy for a Sunday morning. Comfortable environment. Great service."}
{"text":"If you don't already know why you should eat here, then most likely you should look to eat some place else. While I'm a fan of Cracker Barrel, I want you to know that you're not going to get some amazing food here that'll blow your mind or knock your socks off. It's just affordable decent good 'ol American food! It's one of the few places this far West where you can get some decent grits! If you come here with a snooty attitude, then there's a good chance that you'll be disappointed. The place will most likely be packed as with most Cracker Barrels, so there will be a line to get a table. After putting in your name, you can pass time by perusing their souvenirs in the gift shop.

On my most recent visit, I started things off with coffee since I had just driven in from California. If this is your first stop after a long drive, the restrooms are just to the right of the cashiers when you enter the store. For my meal, I ordered their Sunrise Sampler because I couldn't decide on what to get.

*Sunrise Sampler*
It came with pretty much everything... two eggs served with grits, fried apples, hash brown, bacon, smoked sausage, ham, and buttermilk biscuits & gravy. I didn't care too much for the fried apples, but everything else was good for a hearty breakfast especially with a long day ahead of me involving lots of exercise!

The service was great. The place was slammed and my server was trying to get to every one of her tables as fast as humanly possible. She always came by with more coffee and a smile. It was nice to see that other servers were covering for each other. I had to start refusing refills after a while! When you're finished with your meal, just take your check and pay at one of the cashiers."}
{"text":"I was in the area to run a half marathon and this was a great place for a post race meal. Of course it was packed, but they were still able to seat me right away. I ordered their Country Boy breakfast and boy did it hit the spot! My server was also very friendly and always brought around more coffee to refill my cup. I will definitely be returning here for a nice big dependable breakfast!"}
{"text":"OMG those were the nicest and happiest hostesses in the country, I'm quite sure.  The food ended up being \"the norm\" for Cracker Barrel.  EXCELLENT!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for breakfast. Good food, good service, good value! Tends to be very crowded on the weekends, and the wait for a table is very long. Love the country store, where you can get old-fashioned candy, food, drinks and gifts for all ages."}
{"text":"I am from Tennessee (also home to Cracker Barrel HQ) and grew up eating Cracker Barrel; it's one of my favorite breakfast restaurants, and I'll even get their breakfast during lunch or dinner times--so good. We moved to Las Vegas, and they finally built a Cracker Barrel. We've tried this one multiple times, and we've been very disappointed each time.

The quality of food and service is definitively lower than what I'm used so expecting from Cracker Barrel. Sometimes the biscuits come out lukewarm, whereas I'm used to them coming out hot and fresh. We had to wait super long before getting our food, as well as get refills, even when the restaurant was basically empty. When they first opened and had all the trainers here temporarily, it was a totally different store--it was on par if not better than what I was used to in Tennessee. However, since they left, quality has gone downhill. 

All that being said, I love Cracker Barrel, especially since it's the only place I can get country ham out west here in Las Vegas. I'll keep giving this restaurant a shot as well as the others in the Las Vegas area, but improvements are definitely needed here."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while I was on a business trip in Cleveland. The main reason I was here (other than it being across the street from the hotel I was staying at) was that I was wanting to do something after work that night and after dinner. Their gift shop always has a little bit of everything - you can find a gift for yourself or someone else. With it being just before Christmas, I found a cute table top tree decoration for home."}
{"text":"Stopped in to the gift shop here while I was in the neighborhood to pick up a few birthday gifts for a friend. I had a cookbook that didn't ring up at the register that I had to wait on - the manager had to go back to look up the bar code. The lady that checked me out gave me a bag, tissue paper and a ribbon to use for my gift to my friend. She apologized for me having to wait, but was super friendly. Great selection of gifts at the store!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cracker Barrels in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona. One thing I can say with all certainty is that they are consistent. A country fried steak in Albuquerque is the same as it is in Austin. The food is not great, but it's not bad either. If I had to label it, I would use the word acceptable. Even the staff seems to fit the homogenized mold from state to state. So I give the Buckeye store 3 stars, as I would any other Cracker Barrel I have been to."}
{"text":"Sooooo happy that they moved to Las Vegas.  Our waitress Gianna was fantastic.   She has great customer service.      The sweet tea brings me good memories of living in Texas..      there was no waiting time.  I will be back.   Oh by the way country fried steak was absolutely fantastic"}
{"text":"Yes you have to wait long but it's totally worth it. Obviously it must be amazing with this long wait so people need to chill on giving low stars just because of the line. For a party of 5, we checked in at 1 and were seated by 2. The food is amazing ! Just the same as it is on the East Coast. Our server Stuart was very attentive and sweet. Even with the craziness of being opening week, I think the staff did a great job. Very friendly customer service ! Will be dining back again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Sat there for 16 minutes about 5 servers past us went yo desk to complain and still sat there finally we got up and left will never go back to that one."}
{"text":"Excellent service and reccomendation from hostes. Baked chicken breast and mac n cheese was perfect in seasoning and sons Reuben sandwich was on point! Fried apples was perfect to an ending to our meal. My youngest grilled cheese was so perfect as well...not drenched in butter nor salty as other grilled cheese you can taste the saltyness and hands hella oily from butter, this place was so on point! Thanks to our server Holly! Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"This location is extremely nasty.. The food portions are always small. I pay hard earned money for a reuben platter and got nothing but cheese. I want meat on my sandwich and you don't need 5 slices of cheese to make a sandwich. Also poor management skills.. This location doesn't deserve 3 stars because the entire staff don't do their jobs right. They are serving dirty product such as silverware and coffee glasses. They probably don't care about their employees because everyone is always acting like a bunch of mindless, senseless idiots. I wouldn't spend my money on some nasty hashbrown casserole with hair in it anymore either. The whole staff including management are always acting like some wild animals locked in a cage. Very small food portions and unprofessional staff including management. They need to hire more dedicated and determined people who take alot of pride on their work and makes sure everything runs in line like it's supposed to. No wonder why this location is getting alot of complaints on Yelp because their not getting it together. If you people want food, go eat at the Aria or something. At least you get what you paid for and places like that are more professional. It don't take 5 and 6 pieces of american cheese to make a rueben. I can make a rueben 10x's better without having little hairs in my customers food. This location is very dirty and the staff performance is sloppy which means they need to work harder. Be more professional and hungry to win. I don't mean dirty.... THIS LOCATION IS DIRTY !!"}
{"text":"We love this place. We only get to come when we visit friends in Arizona. The food is grub. The hashbrown casserole is our favorite. I am now a huge fan of thief coleslaw!!"}
{"text":"A good sit down restaurant with some great food. I've always found something good to get when eating at Cracker Barrel. Definitely worth giving a try if you've never been there before."}
{"text":"This has become a tradition for my family, eating at Cracker Barrel when leaving Vegas.  This was our second visit and our food was absolutely amazing.  This company is known for its consistency in food quality and this trip was no different.  Our servers name was Dani, and she was truly a delight. Personable and jovial, we hope everyone gets a chance to have her as a server at some point."}
{"text":"I have to say first off that excited Cracker Barrel is finally in Vegas.  I've always loved Cracker Barrel!!  Main reason why I come here is...........their PANCAKES!!!!   They are amazing but make sure you eat them hot and with lots of butter and syrup.  If you want really good Fried Chicken, make sure you check this place out on Sundays.  It's the only day it's served."}
{"text":"Good southern/country cooking. Ample portions, good prices. Breakfast is served all day. 
Weekend mornings and early afternoon has long waits, but, you can relax in the front porch in a rocket or browse the countryside while you wait. Friday and Saturday nights there is no wait for dinner. Which is great, since the dozens of \"date night\" type restaurants nearby that all have long very long waits on Friday and Saturday nights. 
They serve home cooking style good like pot roast, meatloaf, cod, trout, fried chicken or steak, ribeyes, chicken and dumplings, mashed potatoes, salads, sandwiches, etc.. They are well known for their hearty breakfasts. Mama's pancake breakfast, country boy breakfast, and Uncle Hershal's are some faves. They do have a healthy options section in their menu also."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Cracker Barrel in quite a long time, and I was glad to see  that it is still as good as I remembered from way back when. I won't bore you with details of the ambiance, but suffice it to say that I like the kitschiness of it.

Sandra was our server. She was great,, attentive and helpful.

The only problem was the food. Maybe it's that I've lived in Milwaukee for the last few years where the Friday Fish Fry is very popular and r restaurants have worked for years to come up with great ideas and recipes that would help bring in the customers. 

I ordered the cod. There was enough fish to satisfy me, but I would have liked the pieces to have been a bit thicker and MAYBE a little wider. Really, they reminded me more of fish nuggets than fillets. The flavor fell a little flat for me too. 

Food I remember from way back was pretty great. Maybe I've become a fish fry snob."}
{"text":"Love this place wish they had on in California. The breakfast is off the hook. Make sure to try the camp fire chicken."}
{"text":"Breakfast. Not busy at all on a Sunday morning and we got bad slow service from a waitress that it didn't seem to matter if she wrote order down or not - we weren't getting all our food without reminding her - few times. Food wasn't that  good -  taste was combination of hot sauce, syrup or whatever else we could find to cover the flavor of the crap the spray on their grill.  Best food  option  may have been the candy and junk they sell in the country store."}
{"text":"To the first Cracker Barrel I have ever been to, thank you for always giving me a great experience! Been here multiple times since moving to Arizona and have never been disappointed. From my experiences here, regardless of how busy or hectic it is, the employees have always been respectful and attentive. The customer service is always spot on!

Ordered the Homestyle Chicken Sunday special with a side of dumplings and cheese grits. My wife ordered the Grama's Sampler with a side of fried apples and pancakes. I want to give a shout out to our server Armando for the Sunday special recommendation! The golden brown, juicy and flavorful chicken was delicious and perfectly cooked! I think I just found my new favorite dish!

So before the year is up I am giving this place what I think it deserves...5 Stars!!!"}
{"text":"I go here too often. I figured I'd finally do a review! A lot of parking and the main restaurant building gives you that nice warm feeling to it. Upon entering there is a many nice keepsakes and fun goodies to buy for your house. Depending on the season or upcoming season they change the mood inside. And let me tell you...it is one of the best parts of coming here! Now to the restaurant. It is a very open environment with wooden seats and tables. The service is quick and professional. You A very homey feeling with many old style decorations around the wall. The food always taste great and it is decently priced. Ordered the seasonal Maple Pecan chicken fried chick. The amazing mix of sweet and salty just come together so well! Ordered the country fried steak as well and it taste just as great every time! The chicken and dumplings are something you can never go wrong with! No matter what sides you order you will definitely enjoy! From the fried okra, hash brown casserole and fresh fruit to the green beans, Mac and cheese and fried apples... so many to choose from you will have to come back multiple times to try them all! Overall this place has its place in my heart and stomach, and I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. My party and I arrived here at 10:15 knowing it was going to be packed. We were fine with waiting the hour they told us it was going to be.... Until we started seeing other customers who came in AFTER us being called BEFORE us. So now that we had waited the hour plus an extra 20 minutes they called our name then told us we had to wait for our table to be exited by previous guests. Then finally the hostess got us, brought all 4 of us to the middle of the room and told us to wait for our table to be cleaned. Then they take us to a table with only two chairs ?! How could 4 people sit at a table with 2 chairs ?! Then I asked the hostess if we could sit at the table with 4 chairs that was cleaned and she said that was assigned to another guest!!!! Talk about not feeling important. Worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant in my life. Then after sitting down the waitress was rude and took our ketchup and hot sauce to give to other customers as if we weren't using it !!!!!!! They need to get their ducks in a row before they take on this many customers. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"My meatloaf was cold and be sure to check your silverware, had to ask for a clean fork twice. Better off driving to Kingman then go back to this location."}
{"text":"Great home cooking.  Meatloaf, chicken and dumplings are awesome.  It's like southern cooking.  The pancakes are yummy.  Great gift idea in the gift shop."}
{"text":"Went in mid morning on a Sunday, anticipating some wait time. Was told 20 minutes for our group of 6. After about 25 minutes I asked the hostess where we were in the list. She said there was 1 ahead of us. After 10 other names were called and 10 more minutes had gone by, I asked a different hostess how much longer and she said she had us set up at a table earlier and another girl moved us and broke up our table for smaller parties and that she was going to get us seated asap. I overheard the same girl explaining the situation to the first hostess saying that \"we had been there for 37 minutes and they skipped us\" 
Seriously??? We're finally seated and waited for at least 10 minutes with no one stopping at our table. I stopped a waitress and asked her who our waitress was. She said she would go ask. Another 10 minutes go by and a waitress comes up to our table and asks if we're ready to order. 20 minutes later when we did get our food, most of it was cold, the bacon was burnt, the grits had congealed with a film over the top and ham and sausage was over cooked. The hash brown casserole was very good, as was the biscuits. Went the whole meal without a drink and when I did ask for water, it took about 8-10 minutes for it.
Terribly disappointed in everything about this Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I was totally excited to finally try Cracker Barrel. I've heard so much great thing about this play the food the things they fell. My friend that I came here for breakfast and let me tell you it didn't disappoint. The service here what Space our server was on top of it she was finally she suggested so many things for us to eat and she always kept up with refill and making sure that everything was good. With  that being said let's get to the food I had the cinnamon French toast combo with the smoked pork sausage and scrambled eggs. It was heaven I have to say if I can describe it that would be the word! Cinnamon toast wasn't too sweet it was just right and the pork smoked sausage I've never had that before like that and it was the licious I wish I could've bought some oahu with me. My friend ordered the cheesy hashbrowns which was also delicious. We told the server that we are from Hawaii and she was so nice to give us a free order of cinnamon rolls biscuits which is kind of like a scone which was also delicious the overall feel of the place I just loved it. We were going to try and come back for dinner but we didn't make it back in time. The prices here are really good and you get a lot of food we actually had  leftovers to take back to the hotel. If you get a chance check out to crackle barrel it won't disappoint definitely going back there again when I'm in Vegas"}
{"text":"Happy Mother's Day--NOT!  We were seated immediately and congratulated ourselves for choosing to go at an off time like 3:00pm.   Unfortunately we were to quick to celebrate our good fortune because things got ugly quick. We waited a good 15 mins for someone to take our drink  order and another 20 to get the drink order.  Add another 15 minutes and our waiter brought out burned corn bread for our dining pleasure. We should have left at this point, but being the hopeful people we are we waited another 10-15 minutes to be served our dinner.  My husband ordered a sirloin steak medium, he received some unknown cut of meat burned to a crisp.  The waiter then proceeded to put down my meal, however half of it was missing.  At this point, we told the waiter to just bring dinner for our kids and take or two meals off the check.  20 minutes later the manager has taken our two meals off the check, but he has failed to come talk to us even though we requested such.  Thank you so much Cracker Barrel for a truly awful Mother's Day meal experience."}
{"text":"Waited over a hour for cold food.  Service is a zero.  Corporate need to clean house at this place.    Been here several times.  Service is still bad.  This place needs a management intervention."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time at this location since it has opened. During the weekend is usually really busy but service never suffers because of it. All staff is always nice and helpful in the store and in the restaurant. Food is always quick and service always grade A! I came in during the week on a Tuesday morning and was greeted by at least 3 employees and seated right away. Our server was knowledgeable and helped with suggestions and ordering. Our food was out within 20 mins and kept our drinks filled, including coffee. Pancakes are the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD. EVER. They're fluffy while being buttery and crisp. They serve mini bottles of their famous 100% maple syrup. You can take the bottles as souvenirs. The country store is amazing! It always has the best little trinkets and candy available. Their prices are unbeatable and stock is always changing. So if you see something you love, buy it! One of their clerks made sure we were findings everything okay and even suggested some caramels and candy, which we ended up buying. Great location, great service! Can't wait until they open up in the high desert in cali! Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving them a three star because our waiter was really nice, they really don't deserve any stars in my opinion. We came on thanksgiving, I understood it would be crowded. We waited for over an hour (we were told 30 minutes) and it took over an hour to get our food once we were seated! The manager came out and started blaming his employees and the company (great managing skills).  Our food finally arrived, we ate and left!"}
{"text":"After months of waiting it out, we finally came to Cracker Barrel. I gotta say I was hoping to like this place.

Got there at 1230 this afternoon, wait time was 5-10mins but was pleasantly surprised when we got paged not even 3minutes later. Thought to myself...great start!  We were led to our window side table . 10minutes passed , no one came to get our order. The couple that came after us got their drinks served way before we finally got someone's attention. 20mins later, we got our orders taken. 3 of us ordered fried fish(1 cod and 2 catfish) and kid's grilled cheese. For our sides, we ordered Mac n cheese, fries, turnip greens, apple slices and corn muffins. Drinks are iced sweet tea, lemonade and milk for the kids.

An hour after we got seated, the fried cod was served. Yup, just one of us got her food. 20minutes later, we got the rest of our order, minus the corn muffins but we were given fried apples that we didn't order. My friend got fed up and asked for a manager who came and apologized and promised to make things right. He brought the corn muffins and 2 extra biscuits for the bother. Really?

As for the food., the  fried catfish was really good but the serving was way too small compared to the fried cod. The mac n cheese and fries were good as well. The breading  on the fried cod was very salty and the turnip greens were inedible. The corn muffins were no better. They were dry and grainy. The lemonade and sweet tea were refreshingly good though. 

I find it odd that they had so many people standing around yet very few servers. This place is VERY chaotic, with servers running around like headless chickens.

It's a very disappointing 2 hours experience. Sadly, we won't be coming back unless they get their act together."}
{"text":"While in Az this place came up as a must try. This was my first time eating here so I didn't know what to expect. The outside looks like a typical country barn. When you enter you are instantly greeted by Cracker Barrel's small store. Their is a variety of great things you can purchase. I made my way to the hostess and she sat my sister and I fairly quickly. I would guess that the average cost per plate is about $10-11. I ordered the BBQ chicken breast. For sides I decided on seasonal mixed veggies and a sweet baked potato. As a courtesy I received a biscuit and some corn bread. Overall the food was good. My chicken was dressed with BBQ sauce and topped with small potatoes. The chicken was cooked to perfection. My mixed veggies were fresh and tasted excellent. The biscuit and corn bread were average nothing special about those. Overall the restaurant was very cool and country. If you are in AZ I would recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I had a craving for fried chicken and decided to go to cracker barrel for their Sunday fried chicken. Waited over 10 minutes after being seated and a server never stopped by our table. 
Never coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Having frequented the Colorado Springs CO location for years, I was excited to go to the one in AZ. Very disappointed. The hostess acted out out and rude when she seated us. Our server was amazing, friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the food wasn't good. Small portions, no jelly, had to ask twice, and the food was luke warm to cold. The floors were sticky and our service dog ended up with scraps on his fur. 

Hope they can fix the issues."}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars!

Even though we gave it a few months before we attempted to visit Cracker Barrel, it was SOOOOO crowded!

Seriously, the walk-in wait was at least an hour and a half for a Saturday morning!  Luckily we used the online wait list on the Cracker Barrel website to reserve us a table.  Wait was still 45 minutes, but much of that time was taken up by us driving across town to get to the restaurant.  If you have the option to use the online wait list I suggest you do it!  Unless you LOVE sitting outside in one of their many rocking chairs.

Cracker Barrel entry was pure chaos!  Even walking into the restaurant you're greeted with a crowd swell of people.  That's probably because the restaurant itself is connected to their 'old country store'.  Which is speak for, \"Please spend way more money with us then you ever intend to!\"  We still had a 10 minute wait before being seated so we wandered around the country store to see what goodies we could find.  Very kitschy but kinda fun just to look.  However be careful because you need to control traffic with the TONS of other folks walking the store, not to mention the line of people waiting to pay their food bill!  Be prepared to be in tight spots.

Coming to Cracker Barrel on a weekend can almost be considered a mistake.  The restaurant is so busy and CROWDED!  Really, there was not one empty table when we dined that day.  Soon as one was cleaned up it was almost immediately filled with the next party.  That being said, service was a little rushed.  Our server was brand spankin' new (like as in he started 2 days prior) so he was still trying to get around the menu and the restaurant service.  He answered our questions to the best of his knowledge, got confused a few times but was pretty apologetic about it.  Our family ended up ordering:

-Sunrise Sampler (2 orders) - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole, homemade buttermilk biscuits, sawmill gravy, smoked sausage, country ham & thick-sliced bacon

-Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast - 2 eggs cooked to order with grits, fried apples, hashbrown casserole & smothered country fried steak

Order took a long while - nearly 30 minutes!  I ordinarily would start to throw a tiny fit especially at breakfast but this is what I signed up for with an overcrowded place with fairly new staff.  Thankfully though our food arrived still very hot.  Fresh @$$ biscuits!!  These were the first thing I jumped into, and damn they were worth the calories!  Buttery, a little flaky, warm - delicious with a side of apple butter or some fried apples on top!  I ate 3 of them before I could notice.  Don't hesitate for a refill of biscuits, our server was more than happy to give us a few more.

Our breakfast platters ended up being just so-so, just OK.  Food was warm but the over-easy eggs were overcooked so they weren't as yolky like I like in the middle.  The hashbrown casserole was kind of a one liner - I really don't like soggy potatoes, I wish it was fried on the flattop with a more crisp exterior.  For myself at least, the samples of sausage, ham & bacon weren't anything special.  Tasted just like the breakfast meats you find at your average breakfast diner chain.  Wifey said her country fried steak was tasty - I did have a bite and I have to agree.  Was fried well, and covered with that white gravy it was so rich, after a few bites it would probably be too much.

The food was overall OK with us but very HEAVY, some stick-to-your-ribs type affair.  We had a lot of leftovers to take home with us, even after we were done we still had 2 full takeout boxes!  

It's not particularly cheap to eat at the Cracker Barrel, for our family of 3 it ended up coming to over $45 easy after tax + tip.  Just above average pricing for breakfast but still, I like value ya' know??  I could have gotten breakfast at other restaurants for less.  But we were glad we made the drive at least once to check out Cracker Barrel.  No longer have to really drive here though to have it again...we now have one on our side of town right near Craig road!  May have to visit this one the next time I get a biscuit craving!

{"text":"I was so excited to FINALLY visit this restaurant! Unfortunately within seconds of sitting down our waitress came over and asked if we were ready to order. I hadn't even opened the menu, I said we'll start with waters first a minute later she came back and asked if we needed more time. I understand they need to turn tables but geez let me look over the menu! I was so excited to have my breakfast but unfortunately most items came with eggs on the menu. I asked her if I could substitute the eggs for anything else. She said she would have to ask her manager, she did and the manager said it would be an extra charge. I was appalled that the manager and the waitress didn't even try to suggest anything and that they would take 25 cents off for the eggs! The food was mediocre you can tell they mass prep a lot of the food as it was cold, and the cheese has already harden from sitting out. Will not be returning here, so disappointed really wanted to love it."}
{"text":"I chose this Cracker Barrel because my work group uses this location for all of our big events, like Christmas Parties and Birthdays. Today they went above and beyond to accommodate our 20+ group. I let them know 24 hours ahead of time we would be coming so they could prepare. They let us bring a cake and provided plates and forks so we could eat it. They also provided two waitresses to help with our large group. I was tremendously pleased with their service. I can't say enough nice things about this location and how they were so helpful and understanding with our big party. Special shout out to Patty, Brooke and Shelby for helping us with our party today. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"On our way back to San Diego after Spring Break in Vegas & we just wanted to stop for a bite to eat before hitting the road.  Saw this place as we were driving by on the 15 & have always wanted to try them as we continually see commercials in town & have never seen one around, so we wound our way back to find a 45 minute wait, which made us think maybe it was a pretty good chain place to go... WRONG!

First, the customer service could use some improvement.  The lady out front taking names was friendly enough, but the waitress not so much.  Without being downright rude, she was about as unfriendly as you could get.  Very curt when speaking w/ you, sort of just drops the plate in front of you & if you want a refill or something, you practically have to turn into one of those guys on the runway of an airport w/ the light sticks to direct airplanes flailing your arms all around.

Second, the menu/specials are confusing.  They have a chicken fried steak breakfast & a separate one for lunch (only the lunch one is on the menu... other one was a special).  The breakfast one comes w/ 3 sides, none of which are any good... NO eggs, bacon or sausage (just things like mushrooms, etc.).  So, since you can't order breakfast items w/ your breakfast, I chose the lunch version & except for the French fries, the selections are just about as bad... enough so, the fries were the only thing I wanted as a side.  They offered to do 2 of the sides as fries, but not the 3rd for whatever reason, so I ordered a salad that my wife wanted.

& third (& most importantly), the food... practically inedible!  Not sure if all Cracker Barrels are this bad, but this one was disgusting!  Back to the aforementioned salad... it was basically a small salad w/ a TON of dressing on it... yuck!  The French fries were dry, stale & chewy. The chicken-fried steak tasted like it went through a conveyor belt, had some premixed breading that's stored in a plastic bag stamped on each side, flash fried & then flash frozen for shipping.  The gravy was pure white & tasted funky.

Literally the ONLY good thing here was leaving!"}
{"text":"OMG. I am so happy I don't have to go 500 miles for this comfort food amazing ness. Ok so this is the third week the store is open and YOU WILL WAIT 1-2 hours and yes ITS HOT AS H E double hockey sticks outside. Put your name in go rock in a chair or shop at Bass and stop complaining about it. Come way before you are STARVING. If you are hungry bring some crackers or celery to chew on while you wait.  The wait did not ruin my mood I expected it. You two tables next and behind me complaining about the wait the whole time I was eating ruined my mood. The hard working waiters don't need to hear about your wait for 25 minutes. Smile. Give them your order and for christs sake the food is cheap, these people make nothing, tip them GOOD!  I watch everything and these tables of two leaving four bucks and tables of four leaving five or six ones. You are ridiculous. You come here to drop your Benjies on a green table you can drop a Jackson on the brown one. And no I DO NOT WORK at a Cracker Barrel. As a matter of fact I have never waited in my life. 
OK that is my rant. 
The food is AMAZING very accurate Cracker Barrel food. The staff tries very hard and is friendly and attentive. If you want the best get the breakfasts the chicken fried steak or the amazing sampler platter. Sweet tea is awesome and you will be on a sugar high all day. Oh man split some pancakes best you will ever eat, ever.  Buy some goodies for Ma and grandma on your way out and plan on going back to your home/hotel and take a nap after from the carb coma. So good you will think about the good ole days when grandma."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was wrong. Long wait in a small store. The food was VERY bland. I don't know why everyone was excited about it. Each meal was bland and tasted like fast food. I will never return and highly recommend no one try this place. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great food and large selection. Nice comfy, homey feeling. Great lunch specials for $5.95. Amazing fried chicken on Sundays. Have been going their for years and its always good."}
{"text":"One word,  Awesome! They need to build a new location in the Los Angeles Area. This is my second time at a Cracker Barrel and it didn't disappoint. Not only is it a restaurant but it has what looks like a general store right next to it. Only it's really a gift shop. We came to eat breakfast before heading to Camelback Ranch to see the Dodgers. 

Cons
- The food was amazing. We ordered the  Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast which has Two farm fresh eggs with grits and your choice of Fried Apples or Hashbrown Casserole ~ plus ~ Chicken Fried Chicken or Country Fried Steak. Comes with All the Fixin's. We recommend the Hashbrown Casserole.
- Our waitress was fantastic. She kept refilling my coffee without me asking her and bringing creme. She also refilled our waters and asked if there was anything else needed.  I even wanted to order an extra plate of the Hashbrown (you don't get alot) & she
 brought them out in 2 min. 
- The pecan pancakes are a must.  They give you your own little maple syrup bottle.
- The biscuits and gravy are awesome
- Food was brought out in a timely manner
- They let us charge our phones while we ate.
- Love that they give you your bill and you pay upfront

Cons
- It gets packed so be prepared to wait 15 to 45 min or get there before 9 am. We only waited 15.
- Tends to get crowded in the store
- You may have to wait in a line to pay your bill because the register is for store and restaurant.
- Parking lot gets pretty full

What sets them apart is their amazing exceptional service. We originally put our reservations for 9 but out group was running late so we sat down at the table to wait.  They took so long that we ordered and told the waitress it was only going to be 2 of us. Our party got their just as we were finishing up. They came to our table, we told the waitress this was our party and rather than having to wait 15 min they allowed them to take our table.  That was awesome, we walked to the car show while they ate and then we all headed out to pregame at Camelback Ranch."}
{"text":"The first thing at Cracker Barrel is that you are going for a certain kind of food and ambiance with a specific client base.   That being said the evening we were here there was a large gathering with a family celebrating what appeared to be the graduation of 2 girls in the family.   At some point in the meal one woman became very agitated and began yelling at another woman at the table.   This proceeded for about a minute before other family members could shuffle her out.   FANTASTIC dinner and a show!   I am sure families that had brought small children who were subjected to the scene and language were appalled but since I was at a table with 3 adults we could laugh about it. 

The food was about about average.  I had gotten the shrimp which comes with buttermilk rolls, cornbread rolls, hush puppies and 3 sides.   The one thing I can say is the food you get for your value is very good.    The shrimp was middle of the road, though I have nothing negative to say about the meal as a whole.    The hushpuppies were very good as were the buttermilk biscuits,  I did not partake in the cornbread as the tremendous massive amount of food was too much to eat everything that was brought out to me.    

If you are looking for a cheap meal for the family at a good value, this is a good alternative to your typical diner fare."}
{"text":"Went here on Thanksgiving since we were visiting the area and staying at a hotel with no kitchen. They were super busy as one of only a few restaurants open on Thanksgiving. 50 minute wait to be seated. The long wait in the store section kept us occupied browsing and playing checkers. Waitress was pleasant and very attentive. We had the turkey meal for all five of us. We were all stuffed. Nice simple meal and a good price."}
{"text":"The bathroom was clean and fresh smelling, the dinning room was clean. Very professional and hospitable staff. We came in around 10:39 am. We didn't have to wait to be seated. I ordered the breakfast sampler. We didn't have to wait to long for our food, and it was nice and hot. The biscuits were hot and good, the side gravy was ok, the bacon & scrambled eggs was cooked just right, the sausage patti and ham were cooked just right, the grits were bland but not to thck or watery nothing a little butter, salt & pepper couldn't fix. The Grapefruit juice was good."}
{"text":"I mean, its Cracker Barrel. You walk in knowing what to expect. The food is a 2 star experience, but the service was really great. Our server, Zac was so sweet and attentive and just made for such a pleasant dining experience. I would come back just because of the really positive experience with our server."}
{"text":"Yuuuuuuuum!!! Fried Apples. Apple Butter!! Sausage! Grits could have been a bit better but everything else was great!!! Wish they had one in CA!!!!! 

Only -1 star for having to walk around the entire building to find the entrance!! Who puts a restaurant behind a storefront?!!!"}
{"text":"In the event anyone's actually looking for reviews of a Cracker Barrel, here is one.  Their pancakes are pretty special.  They're almost fried because they're cooked in so much butter.  The edges are crispy.  And buttery.  And the pancakes are served with maple syrup.  Actually, I noticed they finally succumbed to the \"make money at all costs\" impulse and it's now a maple syrup blend.  Whatever... it's not Aunt Jemima.

I think they're the best pancakes anywhere.  I would never come here for lunch or dinner.  I would come at lunch or dinner time to eat pancakes, but that's about it.  

I also enjoy picking up a pack or two of clove gum on my way out.  Maybe some squirrel nut zippers candy.

Pancakes, 5 stars.  Rest of breakfast, 4 stars.  Everything else, meh...

But really, the pancakes are different.  My wife hates them.  I could eat them all day every day.  If you love pancakes and haven't been to Cracker Barrel, give it a whirl.  Tell us what you think."}
{"text":"Always a great place to go for a family meal! They move pretty fast, even on days where it is super busy, and the food is always good. The store keeps the munchkin happy, but can make your wallet unhappy if they really latch onto some toys lol."}
{"text":"First time eating at Cracker Barrel. Very busy since on Sunday for early family dinner. The fried chicken dinner meal was excellent. Chicken was moist and not over cooked. One of the better mashed potatoes I've had in a while. We also ordered the meat loaf. Also prepared nicely. Good comfort foods at a reasonable price. The biscuits were a little dry. The corn muffins did not have much taste too. Service was ok. Suggest that the servers long braided hair be tied back and not flapping around. Numerous times hair nearly touched a number of the food plates that were being placed or served to customers."}
{"text":"This place has an old fashioned country cook feel. The gift shop area is great and has a good assortment of items. 
The food is decent. Some items are hit or miss but a majority of the time it's good. The buttermilk pancakes are tasty. The grits are always cold and gross. We like the lemonade and root beer in a frozen glass. It's a good place for a large crowd because the food is priced well for the portion and a good variety."}
{"text":"I travel a lot, therefore I have to eat out a lot. Every once in a while I just want some good old home cooked food. This is the place. I have tried everything on their menu and have never been disappointed. I had the grilled catfish today. Waitress was a \"rising star\" named Samantha did a great job."}
{"text":"We went to the new Cracker Barrel.  It was really busy, but the staff was very organized.  The food was top notch.  I had the Lemon Pepper Trout and it was awesome.  My spouse had fried catfish which was also excellent.  What I like best about this place is the sides.  Between us we had beans, greens, mac-n-cheese, sweet potato, and dumplings.  All of them were great.  This place is brand new so I forgive them for the wait.  They have a few kinks to work out, but for a place that's still having a grand opening it was not bad.  Our 1-3/4 hour wait was really only 1 hour and was worth the wait.  The country store has enough to look at for an hour to kill the time.  I will be back often.  Where else can you get a fish dinner with three sides for $10-$12 ?"}
{"text":"I've been to this Cracker Barrel at least 6 times so far and loved it every time.  The place is always packed.  I love that I can make a \"reservation\" online in advance before showing up.  Since doing this I have never waited more than 15 minutes for a table.

I love the trout, Friday fish fry being partial to the haddock.  Haddock is a hard fish to find in the western US. I've tried the chicken livers and liked them.  Chicken fried steak.  Chicken and dumplings, the pork chops are tender and flavorful...  I've probably tried half the menu.  The prices are all reasonable especially the daily specials and the $7.99 dinners.  Even the seafood dinner entrees are only $10-$12 including 3 side dishes.

I've loved every side dish I've ever tried here.  The hash brown casserole, the turnip greens, the mac and cheese, the side salad, the beans, the okra is OK.  I like that even if the menu says something comes with fries they always substitute with no problem.

I have only one criticism of the place.  I don't really like them for breakfast.  In my opinion there are better places for breakfast in the area.  On the other hand their country ham is pretty good. 

Also it's more than just a restaurant.  It has a store to wait while your table is made ready."}
{"text":"My 1st time here. I absolutely love the store there. They have great stuff for gifts and yourself. They have old fashion candies there. I love the food too. I have the egg sandwich and it comes w a generous portion of hash browns. Mom got the buttermilk pancakes and it comes w a cute bottle maple syrup. My server was Tammy and she has great customer service. She kept refill our coffee. I definitely be back w my family."}
{"text":"Love this place, service is great, food is fantastic, welcoming people, and don't get me started on how affordable it is. I just love it here! Just moved here from California and I can't get enough! 
The only thing I wish was if the bathrooms were a little more cleaner and updated."}
{"text":"I've been in Las Vegas since 2007.  People ask me, do you miss Kentucky?  The answer is, \"I miss Cracker Barrel.\"  I will admit to crying tears of joy upon learning we were getting this fine establishment.  When I am in need of some hearty, delicious Southern breakfast, Uncle Hershel always delivers. Always.

This Crack Bar is consistent. I've gone on a weekday, a weekend and even PostMated it. I am not ashamed.  The wait times are minimal, but if you find yourself waiting before the heat kicks in, mosey out to the porch and find a rocking chair. No matter what ails you, a rocking chair is the cure.  Once your name gets called and you find yourself in the cavernous dining room (all Crack Bars are loud), be prepared for fast, friendly service. My biggest complaint about CB is that service is hit or miss. Not so here. We have always had great service and a visit from the manager to check on us. A+

Now for the food. My ability to make recommendations is severely compromised by the fact that I literally order Uncle Hershel's Favorite every single time. I can tell you the biscuits are crunchy, the gravy is the perfect consistency (no glue here!) and the food is hot and fresh.  Years ago, I was a big fan of the veggie plate for dinner but I haven't had dinner yet at this location. #2018Goals."}
{"text":"First time I tried Cracker Barrel was in Florida so I was excited when I saw one open up in Vegas. I definitely have an obsession with their buttermilk pancakes. Also, our server Jordan was absolutely amazing, love her energy and she was on top of everything. Definitely be back the next time I visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"You have many choices in great Cracker Barrel restaurants along your traveling way in the Phoenix area!  Do NOT choose this one. The service is terrible, workers have an attitude & make mistakes, the manager cannot manage workers during busy times and they do not want to take electronic gift cards. The shop ladies show an annoying non-trusting tone. Food is terrific, that is not the issue. This store is totally mismanaged and does not reflect the corporate 'customer first' attitude that is prevalent at other Cracker Barrel's.  My advice just skip this CB until they make changes. Just go to another down the road and convenient to I10."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Buckeye! Lunch/Dinner? They're ok. The portions will make a fat boy dance and a skinny boy ask for a to-go container. Friendly, nice decor and clean."}
{"text":"Sandra was great food  came fast was very tasty the place is clean reasonably priced definitely can't go wrong I just wish you could pay the server and not have to wait in line to pay I know it's because they want to get in the gift shop but I'm standing in line behind 10 people that's the only downside of this place.  I just want to pay and go"}
{"text":"How people can love this restaurant is beyond me. I've been to multiple locations and they were all disappointing. The only reason it gets two stars instead of one is because I thought their breakfast was OK.

Every time I go here I am unimpressed. My food comes out cold, overcooked and overall very bland. The only good thing are the biscuits you get to munch on beforehand. Even the cornbread tastes bland. I didn't think that was possible!

Boring and bland. I'd rather spend my money on The Waffle House."}
{"text":"Bleh... i used to enjoy this place. 

I expected to wait and hour. I expected it to be noisy and packed, and the service to be a bit off because of that. But i never expected to not want to come back here after my meal. Cracker Barrel was never a place i looked to for a fine dining experience, but more like a hearty meal that was offered on the cheap and didn't taste too bad at the same time. Without going into detail on the already mentioned, horrible service, tasteless cold food, and not worth the efforts of the wait. Ill just chalk it up to saying there are far better options with the same price points and far better service and food, and within a reasonable radius of this location as well. Think twice about waiting in the heat for 45-60 minutes to eat sub par food, as its likely you will leave with disappointment."}
{"text":"Loved the melt in your mouth meatloaf. Not as homie as Mommas but you know what left a taste of goodnesss in my heart. Love the cute setup and store. First time here for lunch not dissapointed one bit. It was my first time down in Phoenix yummm thank you server. Ice tea to die for. Unlimited tea. Taste like home."}
{"text":"As a family, we come here when family from out on town is here being they don't have Cracker Barrel in there area. Last night I can't say what took place but boy was service off! It was odd being a gentleman sitting next to our table, came to our table and asked, did they take your order yet or even take your drink order? This gentleman spent a fair amount of time speaking with us at the table and just seemed bothered by the fact our service was so NOT there! Our servicer Ro was very sweet just seemed to have more than she can handle or maybe just had an off day. I gave them 3 stars being the service was off but the food was still pretty good. I had to ask for the one part of my meal but what topped the food is, we were told \"someone paid it forward\" I thank the person who did this yet I feel that because the server forgot about us is why are meal was paid for by management. I could be wrong! And please note, while we were there we did not complain or make a fuss about the service but I had to post to Yelp too thank the person out there who possible paid it forward to us."}
{"text":"We have been taking our kids here for years and I've never been dissatisfied. Service is always fast, efficient, friendly. And the food is always tasty, filling and just what we ordered. Don't forget about the coffee and the very cute country store and all of the old time-y stuff you find there!

I don't know what others are complaining about, I always leave seeing customers satisfied."}
{"text":"The food can be a hit or miss but when it's a hit it's really good. Ask for their more popular dishes and you can't go wrong. My absolute favorite is their pancakes and coffee."}
{"text":"Guess the wait staff must be rich - because they don't want my money! Sat and ignored for 10 minutes. LOL 


Why can't you give one star? 

Sat for 10 minutes with 0 service, while my date who wasn't feeling well was waiting on water. Walked up the the hostess, said she'd \"yell at someone for not coming over and send someone right away.\" Must have never happened, because still no one came to even get us water. 

Funny, because the same hostess that seemed to care so much said nothing as we walked out of the restaurant - clearly because we still had gotten no service.

My date even waved around the restaurant, trying get a waitress to at least get us water as she was feeling ill (the whole reason I took her here was to get soul food for her cold) 

Feel bad for dragging my sick date out to get some good warm food to be sat and ignored!"}
{"text":"I love the home cooking and good service.  Food is very good for the price.  Two of us ate for a little over $15 and that's fantastic.  I'm used to dropping over $30 (that's with tip) at an IHOP for a two-some and that food is not that good at all."}
{"text":"It's a cookie cutter experience.  I could not tell the difference between my local Cracker Barrel and the Cracker Barrel we went to in Atlanta.  You get great service, good food, and fair prices.  Count me in."}
{"text":"Food is good  food portions are moderate. For the most part services usually quick and friendly. Beautiful fireplace usually in service. Facility is well maintained and clean. Store has a lot of unusual items that you don't find in a regular retail store. And checkout is generally quick and friendly. If you like catfish would highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place when crossing the boarder.  It still packs up but the service and quality of food is my what it used to be.  I had an issue last time I came and today they actually served me some burnt bacon that falls apart, by the time the replacement came to the table, the eggs/hash browns etc.. was cold

I'll think twice next time about coming here.  Such a shame

{"text":"The absolute worst food ever!! NO FLAVOR!! Macncheese  Mashed taters  Greens!!!! Bitter, tuff, and guess what? NO FLAVOR!!!! Biscuits and Cornbread...NO well, you already know what I'm wanting to write. So very disappointed  I've been wanting to try this place for so long.  The best part of that visit, was the cute little lady. She was the cashier. I came to her rescue. Some man was cussing at her. I let him and his daughter have it!!! So CB...others may love your place. NOT I!!!"}
{"text":"The worst food, just awful.  Not the servers fault or the cook, just bad cheap frozen supply.  Can not believe people line up for this."}
{"text":"I like It here and have been here before but this visit was a bit upsetting.  Yes, it is Easter Sunday at 5:30p and it was so crowded earlier we left and came back after shopping.  The men's room was FILTHY and looked like it hadn't been serviced all day.  The dining room floor was also dirty - nothing that a broom couldn't clean up with minimal effort.  The kitchen was also slow today.  I expect more from a large chain like this.

8/8/16 Back again.  Service slow on a Sunday at 7a when it is half empty.  Dining room floor dirty again.  How hard is it to sweep up after people leave a table????"}
{"text":"I used to love going there.  Had chicken and dumpling, always get extra for the next day, never again.  Chicken was so over cooked it was like mush, dumplings were so under seasoned.  Hubby got a rib eye?  At least that is what it said on menu.  Not sure what kind of shoe it came off of.  Talked to manager but he said he tasted the chicken and dumplings and HE liked it.  I have been going there for over 30 years and I will NOT be returning,  So if you like the way it used to taste good luck.  Server and cashier were friendly and helpful until the manager saw one cashier helping me, told her to get back behind the counter (no one was waiting)"}
{"text":"You can't wrong with Cracker Barrel. Great food!! Always our go to place when in Arizona."}
{"text":"What isn't there to love about Cracker Barrel. I love everything from the Cracker Barrel store, the staff, and the amazing food. You just feel at home when eating at Cracker Barrel. I got the new steak skillet breakfast dish which is pretty good but the steak was not seasoned very well. Definitely  had to put a lot of hot sauce on it.  My girlfriend got the special berries French toast with jelly which was pretty legit."}
{"text":"I was overnight at a hotel that had a very expensive breakfast so when I woke up I searched nearby for some place to eat. When I saw Cracker Barrel I stopped looking. Cracker Barrel has been consistently good no matter where I have been in my travels. This Cracker Barrel follows the standard and provided a quick, tasty, and reasonably priced breakfast. Also as usual the people who worked here were very friendly. I defiantly recommend this Cracker Barrel if you are looking for Breakfast."}
{"text":"Very disappointing in my lunch today.  I had the roast beef dinner.  The flavor  was good but my meat portion was very small
 Not worth the 11.00 dollars i paid."}
{"text":"I am always hesitant to eat at chain restaurants, but after a bad experience at our hotel, we had to eat breakfast somewhere else.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of breakfast!  He went for Grandpa's Fried breakfast with the chicken fried chicken, grits, biscuits, and eggs over easy.  I had the Mama's french toast breakfast with well done bacon, and egg whites.

The eggs were each done perfectly.  The chicken was really good if you like that kind of thing for breakfast.  The well done bacon was actually well done, and the pure maple syrup warmed in my own little bottle was perfect!

We didn't wait long even though the place was busy.  (Just a note - another party wanted to be seated but all of them were not there so they would not seat them.  The hostess apologized but said it was Cracker Barrel policy.)  And the gift shop is always nice to browse through. 

Our server was really pleasant, and I would totally come back to this place despite it being a chain."}
{"text":"Moving from NY to Las Vegas I have had to accept that some restaurants are jut not available. Cracker Barrel is one of them. When I get lucky enough to have time to drive to this location I take advantage of it!

As usual it was busy for a Sunday afternoon but I don;t mind much as I love to walk around the store. They sell old fashioned candies and very old country knick knacks such as various candles, stuffed animals and home decor. Since it is a restaurant they also sell cookbooks that range from 30 minute meals to slow cooker recipes. The patio at the entrance has rocking chairs for sale that patrons who are waiting for a table can use. There are also random board games strewn throughout the property, so you can sit and play a game of chess while you wait to be called. 

Typically, when we visit Cracker Barrel we go straight for the pancakes but lately I have been obsessed with sourdough bread and they just happen to have sourdough bread french toast!  So delicious, not overly sweet like french toast can be. The bacon was crispy and the hot cocoa was topped with whipped cream. The only complaint I have on the food is the amount of eggs you get if you ask them to be scrambled, it really looks like they scrambled 1 little egg. 

The prices are very reasonable and the service is always friendly and warm. I recommend stopping in if you happen to be so lucky as to pass by one!"}
{"text":"I'm not very happy with the gift card situation. I purchased a $50 gift card from icardgiftcard and I am unable to use it on the Cracker Barrel website. Only in stores. I can't get a refund either. I really think there should be a disclaimer about that. Now I'm out $50 and nothing can do about it. Total ripoff."}
{"text":"Decided to take my friends/family here after raving about how awesome the chicken fried chicken was... 

We sat down and were pleasantly greeted by Courtney M. (Who explained to me that her brother looked like me and by coincidence had my same name). Her service was AMAZING and her welcoming demeanor made us feel like we were eating with long lost relatives. 

Courtney gave us delicious recommendations, and by have such heartwarming service, it made our experience 100% more awesome. 

We are new residents to Arizona, and we will definitely be bringing our visiting friends and family along. 

Thank you Courtney (aka Sister) for giving us the best service we've EVER had -- and we eat out a lot.

Your \"bro\" from Los Angeles,
Aaron"}
{"text":"Great iced tea. Terrific Roast Beef and mashed potatoes. Love the biscuits. You can't go wrong at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I was so excited for the campfire meals that is back, however it's not same as before which was sad. I got the chicken one and it wasn't the same. The flavor was off and tasted different. It wasn't broken before so why change to fix it. Foil wrapped meals was better than this new way. Never again unfortunately. I ate only half and didn't want to keep eating. Next was the service. The staff is usually good however we got someone new and I had to ask for refills because she would never offer and she was way to worried about clearing the table to push us out instead of waiting for us to be done. She needs training on how to provide customer service because she shouldn't be trying to turn over tables if the guests are still eating it's just unprofessional."}
{"text":"So this is a new restaurant and it has been extremely busy.  We tried 3 times to get in for lunch on different days at different times.  Each of those previous times we were told a 90 minute wait...no thanks.  Today we called and were told there wasn't a wait so we went to eat breakfast.  There was not a wait so we were seated right away, beverages quickly.  We placed  our order from our server Danielle, our food arrived within 10 minutes.  The plates were full of food but not oversized servings.  I had uncle some bodies something which was 2 eggs, I opted for the ham steak, cheese hashbrowns, biscuits and of course grits.  Everything was cooked as ordered and was very delicious. I would definitely go back. However I will not wait for 90 minutes.   I recommend calling to see the wait time."}
{"text":"Fast service, good food and you can chose to match meat with vegetables and skip the same old side dish (potatoes, rice or pasta). Works fine when ever I go, but for groups must be a headache."}
{"text":"Love this place we have been coming here since it first opened. The staff treat you  like family and take the time to great you and see how you are doing... I would recommend this place to anybody..."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cracker Barrel in like ten years. Use to live by one back home. Had s terrible experience at that location with the food. I just never went back to one. My husband loves this place and wanted to try it out. I was hesitant but hey whatever. We got there and as we were driving i put us on the waiting list. Only took about ten minutes to be seated, wasn't bad at all.

The seating area is small, wasn't impressed by getting hit with the chair behind me. Luckily our server Luis was really polite and helpful. He answered our questions and didn't rush us to order. We had sweet tea and I had the chicken fried chicken with mashed potatoes, corn and the tomato onion cucumber salad. I will be bluntly honest with the cucumber salad, I wasn't impressed. Seemed like they prepped it right then and there and didn't leave it to soak (not enough dressing) everything else was spot on no complaints. My husband loved his combo with meat loaf, ham mash potatoes, fried oakra, and coleslaw. We also shared the Pecan pie :)"}
{"text":"Been here several times and haven't been disappointed yet :D The food and service has always been good. I really do enjoy the breakfast menu more than the dinner. We also did Thanksgiving dinner to go last year and it was great - no hassle and the price was great."}
{"text":"Thank you CB for coming to Vegas! One of my all time favorite places to eat. Yes there's a wait however, it's a brand new CB so this should be expected. Every time I eat the Mac n cheese I think of when I was a kid enjoying my grandmas home made mac n cheese on Sunday afternoon. If you are a fan of fresh fried cat fish then I highly recommend. Fried okra, ohhhhh fried okra. 
Just a quick tip; mix a little Mac n cheese with your mashed potatoes and you will thank me later ;)
And don't forget to try the sweet tea. You can get soda anytime but it's hard to come by good quality sweet tea."}
{"text":"Updated review; 
We decided to give this location another try after not having it for awhile. Absolutely nothing has changed since the last visit. Just a handful of tables and still took over 45min to get our food from the time we ordered. Fried okra was tasteless and cold, full of heat lamp grease. I'm assuming they haven't noticed that it's fall because the air conditioning was running full blast.  Fooled me once shame on you, fooled me twice shame on me..."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is! It's consistent, it's fast and people serve you with a smile. Tons of kids and elderly people love it. Lol!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed (25 min) wait. Although they had 10 to 15 wooden rockers with a bench or two out front for your waiting pleasure. After being called to be seated we had to weave around aisle's to locate the hostess stand hidden behind aisle's of merchandise. If they dont want to give ip precious space by the hostess stamd maybe lay down arrows pointing towards line or a stand.  There are no markers ro distinguish where the line starts and ends. The price and value for what you get was awsome. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Way too loud for us so ne prepared. Recommend you try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Long wait times since it is brand new. Expect it. Decent service, people are still in training. Food was warm, not hot. Ordered three eggs, got two. Same situation with bacon, everyone at my table got three pieces, I got two. Coffee was plenty. I expect next time to be better."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and have yet to have a bad experience. The food is always what I'd expect and the service has always been good. I recently went to have breakfast with family and have an amazing server. She was pregnant and still kicking butt! we even had a last min. party member and they made sure everything was far above par. I will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is delicious! I have literally never had an issue ever any time that I've ever eaten here. Sometimes it can be a little pricey but then again the food is always worth it and very good quality. I love their apple cider and have only had an issue when trying to buy it by the gallon. I will add that it is an unorthodox way to purchase that Liquid Gold that is the apple cider LOL. I will not stop coming to Cracker Barrel unless they ever lose their consistency with the quality of their food. Although I don't see that happening anytime soon and will continue to be a customer. Service is always great helpful and courteous I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service,  orders were wrong,  no free muffin/biscuits,  long check out line,  waitress was full of empty promises,  and no refills,  service was slow. Erica our waitress was nice but had her priorities out or order."}
{"text":"Breakfast is one of my favorite meals of the day, which is why Cracker Barrel is so great! They serve breakfast all day and their food is amazing! I'm from California, so there's nothing like eating country-style breakfast like Cracker Barrel! I always get the pancakes when I come here because their syrup is to die for!"}
{"text":"Thirty minutes. 32 to be exact. That is how long it took for the food to come. And It was tepid. The silverware? Filthy. They got my eggs wrong. They forgot my husband's milk with the meal. But what got me is that as we sat there, wth arms crossed, a table full of food and we were not eating. Remember? The silverware was filthy. We asked for it to be replaced and she never came back. So we sat. Food growing colder with ever passing second. I finally went to the hostess station to get a manger, 5 minutes I waited. I brought her back to our table, we told her what was going on. She took the hubby's food but left mine. As we sat there we got more and more irritated. We decided to cut our loses and leave. This is NOT the same Cracker Barrel that we used frequent in Sturbridge, MA. Suffice to say we will never come back. It was a miserable experience. If I could give zero stars I would, but one will have to do."}
{"text":"Oh Cracker Barrel, sweet consistent Cracker Barrel.  Always unexplainably crowded and they're all the same right?  Stopped in for lunch on our way out of town and since it was Friday they do their Friday fish fry special and Sweetie had a hankering for some cod, I guess.

I have been on a gluten free kick lately so I had their baked chicken breast which was baked with a cornflake breading which was pretty tasty.  I don't expect baked white meat chicken to be juicy but Cracker Barrel nailed it.  Mashed potatoes and gravy as a side, we've all had and they were good.  Sweetie's fish was ok, nothing spectacular and the potato was stone cold, called the waitress over and she brought another one which wasn't cooked and it wasn't rolled in the salt like they normally do, her cole slaw tasted old and spoiled.  Now, part of it is the issue but a lot of it is how you respond to the issue and they were very generous and comped her entire meal so I can't complain too much.

Anyhoo, the experience was lacking this visit.....but hey, it's Cracker Barrel and I'll surely be back.....probably not at this location."}
{"text":"finally got to go to Cracker Barrel!!! i was dying to try their breakfast, and was unsure of the next time I'd be in the south, so enjoyed my last breakfast here. the outside porch area is adorned with lots of rocking chairs, very cute. we even ended up taking a picture for the \"longest porch ever\" photo collage they have on their website as well. when you first walk in, you are in their store, which has a lot of knick knacks, and southern treats (which i ended up getting: apple butter (very apple sauce-y), goo-goos, and this hot sauce) which are different by all locations i hear, as this location also had a lot of UNC memorabiliia. 

for breakfast, the dining area is quite large, and theres also a peg game on each table to play with while waiting for your food. our server was so great, and he even let me sample the apple butter before i decided to buy some. I went for the first thing on the menu, the Old-Timer's Breakfast. Boy, was it a lot of food! Two egg whites, biscuits with gravy (delicious!), grits (not a huge fan, but it was good when adding salt and pepper), sausage patties (not the best, i should've gotten bacon), and the hashbrown casserole was the best part! it had the cheesy taste, but not overkill. so much food for only $7.50 or so! i also had a taste of the pecan pancakes and french toast and those were yummy too! 

great experience here, will definitley always go when im down south!"}
{"text":"Good food, comfortable setting and great customer service! The fireplace is a big bonus for me!"}
{"text":"Great choice for comfort food served in big portions.  Definitely not for the low-calorie crowd, but you leave with a good feeling in your stomach.

Had the chicken noodle soup and the country fried steak and they were both great! 

The connected store seems a little hokey but its stocked with stuff that will make some feel a little nostalgic with its down-home vibe.  Tough to resist picking up some candies, chocolates, and sweets after we finished our dinner."}
{"text":"After uncountable pleasant visits to Cracker Barrels across the country, I have just had a rare bad experience.  This was more with the manager, Jason, than the food.

I ordered a chopped steak, medium.  I was served a very dry, extra well-done chopped steak.  The server immediately saw that it was much more than medium and took it back.  The manager brought out a replacement.  I cut into it and it seemed fine.  After he was satisfied and left, I took a bite.  It had an unpleasant taste.  It was tasted nothing like the first one nor any that I have eaten at Cracker Barrel before.  I asked the server to just cancel it, and I would eat the vegetables.

The manager came out and questioned me.  I explained that it wasn't edible.  He told me it came from the same meat that the other one did.  He said he had it cooked one minute less than the other one, even though he had seen some pink in it.  I said I didn't care; I just couldn't eat it.  He pressed me again to explain why.  

In the end, he took the meal off of my bill, but I was insulted and embarrassed by having to explain and justify why I could not eat a chopped steak that had an unpleasant taste.  At some point, the customer should be respected rather than 'grilled' further."}
{"text":"I dined here last Friday night and was quite impressed! Yes, the wait was LONG and painful, but their country store held my attention throughout the majority of the wait duration. In fact, I bought 2 Christmas gifts in their store so it was not only entertaining, but productive! Lots of stuff to browse - think cool scarves, hats, baby clothes, toys, tons of old-fashioned candy, stickers, buttons, odd items that you wouldn't find in a mall, etc.

Once our party was seated, we took a long look at their extensive menu. I ordered the Rainbow Trout (grilled) in lemon/pepper marinade with sides of Okra, Mashed Potatoes, and Cheese Grits. OMGeeee! Sooo good! I've never tried Okra but a fan now! The Cornbread wasn't that great, IMO. I didn't care for the taste and the outside crust was a bit dry.

Service was on-point with smiles and helpful advice. Food arrived in about 10-15 minutes once our drinks were served.

I'll certainly be back for more shopping and dining!"}
{"text":"I had the meatloaf, which was one of the better restaurant versions I have had. I still prefer homemade, but am usually too lazy to cook. The service was fine and the sides were good. I would return."}
{"text":"I have been to Cracker Barrel restaurants in the south and although they aren't much better in terms of food quality this place was a major disappointment on all levels! Upon walking in you walk into a large retail area and check in at the host stand my friend checked in and his name is peter the host said \" peter , oh like Peter Pan , hi Peter Pan !\" That of course didn't go over well with him , upon being called the hostess walked us to our table and said laqwan will be with you shortly , we were greeted by a female who took our drink order , then a very eager male server came over to introduce himself as Ramon even tho his name tag said Armando, we were not even close to being ready as the menu is long and very redundant, we did stop another server to ask the difference between gravies and no one could tell us the difference until one other finally went to kitchen to ask , anyway we ordered breakfast with biscuits and gravy and later food was delivered but alas no biscuits for any of our entrees , with the explanation that they were not ready yet and would be out shortly , after a few long minutes they did come out but were no where near done and partially undercooked , at this point my friends order was still not out and we had to flag down Ramon/Armando to ask where his food was & he ran to kitchen to check and came back out with more undercooked biscuits and a very bland watered down gravy, at this point breakfast ruined as food was cold and congealed & our server did apologize for the food but not his service \" yes , this food is southern and not for everyone \" so bland gravy , undercooked biscuits , congealed grits , over cooked hashbrowns , and although the eggs were cooked a perfect over medium, they would have been nice to with  a GOOD breakfast which this was not ! And although I'm not a McDonald's fan a mcmuffin would have been a way better option than this place for breakfast !"}
{"text":"I nicknamed my \"lunch special\" the \"recession plate,\" as my portion was significantly smaller than my table mates. The food was okay, just kind of fatty. The corn muffins had so much butter it was nauseating - and i love butter. 

The only thing that saved this place was the chocolate bar i purchased in the store area. That shit was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick take out order and they were fast. About ten minutes of waiting in the \"store\" part of the restaurant before my name was called. The biscuits were in one container and the gravy in another, perfect for staying fresh and hot until I got them home.

Access to this Cracker Barrel is a little more challenging than some others with a few turns. There also isn't space for trucks or RVs."}
{"text":"We all got gift cards to Cracker Barrel for Christmas so the next time we were all together the family could go to dinner as we did tonight. Our first visit to this restaurant started out smooth enough. I arrived first and put in my name for a table for five. There was no line then. About 10 minutes later the rest of them pulled to the door and we stood in line waiting to be seated. We were taken to the back about 5 minutes after we got to the host station.

Having never been to Cracker Barrel before, we all took several minutes to look over the menu. We ordered iced tea all around and continued to decode what to order. When our drinks came out, my step mom, my dad and my aunt were given theirs first. As our waitress came around to my grandma the drinks fell and Grandma took a bath. Top to bottom she was pretty well soaked. The waitress apologized and very quickly brought a few towels to mop up the floor, table and chair. She also patted down my Grandma a little bit. She had already taken off the wet jacket but her pants, which were also wet, stayed on leaving poor Grandma wet and cold. Her meal was comped later after my aunt raised a little hell over the accident. We placed our food order shortly after the excitement had died down.

I ordered a Cracker Barrel Sampler. This comes with chicken and dumplings, meatloaf and ham with three sides. I ordered turnip greens, green beans and hash brown caserole. Meals also come with a choice of bread. I got both corn bread and a biscuit so I could try it all. The chicken and dumplings tasted good but I was disappointed that there was just one small piece of chicken. And the dumplings were like giant noodles. Not what I am used to but more traditional or so I am told. The meatloaf was a little bit spicy and very moist. I am probably in the minority here but I prefer a dried meatloaf with a nice crust. This was good though. The ham was just a small piece and very salty. Nothing more to say on that. The green beans were not at all exciting. I can tell they are canned beans and rather mushy. The turnip greens were good. Kind of like spinach but more grassy. They had nice shredded bits of pork mixed in. And the hash brown casserole was the best thing on my plate. Cheesey potato goodness. They only thing that could make that better would be a little more of a crust on top. 

The corn bread was just not good. It was dry, dense and over cooked. Some of the muffins were almost as dark and the rocking chairs out front. The biscuit, on the other hand, was good. Soft, warm and fresh. I'd stick with that for a bread option. 

The house salads my family ordered looked good but it was discouraging to see some of the dressings came in individual packs like you see at fast food restaurants. In fact, I recognized the Mezetti packaging from fast food. I'm not saying Cracker Barrel should make their own dressing in house but do they really need to bring you dressing packets?

My step mom and grandma both ordered the 8 oz. sirloin steak. Both ordered it medium-well. My grandma even said she didn't want to see any blood. The two steaks were done completely different. My step moms was medium-well. My grandmas was more medium and even close to medium-rare. There was blood. She still ate about half.

We also passed around a couple of orders of fried apples tonight. They remind me of the apple dessert I used to get in frozen dinners. Only this was more fresh. I suppose these were pretty good apples but they were very sweet. I would pass on them were I to go back.

A few final notes, I like the store. There are a lot of country goods in there. And some old fashioned candies and sodas. The restaurant decor is cool. I love seeing the antiques. There is a sign in there I would love to have in my garage. Too bad its not for sale. 

This place is OK but I'm not a huge fan. I wish the food was better than average. And I wish it was served warmer than we had it. I will be back again mostly because there is money left on that gift card from Christmas. But Cracker Barrel is not one of those places that I will be at often."}
{"text":"Bad from start to finish ! Our server was Alexis , she gave us our menus and took our drink order . She came back a minute later wanting to take our order .. seriously? I need more than 60 seconds to read a menu.. I promise you can have your table back soon enough! She comes back a second time which is when I gave up and ordered the grandpa special. I had a cup of extremely week coffee and was given exactly 3 creamers - seriously ? You need to ration the creamer ? We should have left right then and there . Knowing we were crammed into a table and on an obvious time limit by the waitress we should have walked out ... But no , we stuck it out and ordered food .. I got the 2 eggs , bacon and fixing plate. Eggs were cold and bacon was awful! Seriously , it was supposed to be thick cut bacon ? It was burned and brittle .. never was offered water, or asked how everything was . My husband was given a dirty set of silverware that we sent back . He had a side plate of the same cheap, salty , brittle \"bacon\". We both left hungry and irritated.  The place was packed , we were chair to chair. So I guess people like it? I know we won't be back. What a waste of money .There are too many places that deserve our patronage ."}
{"text":"Horrible management/Worst cracker battle experience ever. So I'm writing this as we're waiting for the food. I've already decided my opinion. Like a lot of people, Cracker Barrel is nothing new to me. I've been to different stores all over the country. Well management sucks here. They don't want to make you happy. With as long as you have to wait you would expect some decent treatment, like the other stores.  Substitutions on your meal are non existent here. Don't ask for any thing other than what's on the menu. Oh and to tell the customer you WONT country scramble the eggs? Um if you claim to be using only real fresh eggs why won't you do that? Apparently being willing to PAY EXTRA to get meatloaf with my meal CANT be done. Seriously, they wouldn't let me pay them more money so that I could be happy with my meal. I don't understand. And finally, after letting the server know I wasn't happy with the answer, the manager never came over to see what he could do."}
{"text":"i had the chicken fried chicken with mashed and sweet corn. I ate it all; damn near licked the plate. it's more of a hometown feel, with very homestyle food - nothing gourmet, but it hits home. i sound like a bad commercial. 

lemme try this again. 
it was good. tasted like \"home cookin\" with better, which makes everything butter. er well, you know what i mean =) 

the prices are very reasonable, and the ambiance is very family friendly. 
give it a go."}
{"text":"Every time I come here it gets worse won't be coming again. The wait is soooooooooo long we were told 25 min wait we waited for 45min then ordered our food and waited another 35 min we had two kids and two adults. We spent almost 2 hours here. Pancakes were favorless famous hash brown are no longer famous. Won't be coming again!"}
{"text":"Simply the best Chicken and Dumplings in the world.  I have been wanting to come back for many years and it was totally worth the wait. a lets not forget the hot biscuit's and butter......."}
{"text":"My cousins and I came in this morning for breakfast on our way to the Waterpark. The manager stopped by our table and asked us how everything was. We told him everything was amazing and our server Mike was such a good server. While we ordered, he gave us a ton of options on meals and his opinion on how to go about ordering. We told him our little cousin is celebrating remission & the manager and Mike congratulated her and gave her a piece of cake. All in all, we had a really pleasant experience and we will definitely stop here again next time we go to Wisconsin Dells. Thanks Mike & his manager!"}
{"text":"This is where we go to get our chicken and dumplings. Although we can make them at home, it's quicker and easier to come here. 

Once a year, we come here for a mega breakfast. Large fluffy pancakes with crispy edges, maple syrup, eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits with gravy, fried apples, and hash brown casserole."}
{"text":"In the same fashion as the other stores across the country, this meal was amazing. Something you can always count on."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The staff and service were great(thus 1 of the stars)! But the food...edible...kind of. The hash browns were delicious (thus the 2nd star). But everything else...Meh. I would not eat here again for breakfast. (We got some smoked plate and mine had eggs, biscuits, hash browns, and a 3 meat sampler)..skip those. Everything was incredibly dry, bordering on dehydrated astronaut food."}
{"text":"I'm sure that this newest \"West Coast\" iteration of a Southern classic joint might not hold a candle to its predecessors, but... shit! It's a freaking Cracker Barrel! And it's here in Vegas!!! So maybe a liiiiittle bit of that hype transfers over to the experience for some folks, but I can definitely see how many might feel shorted on the service or the food. I, on the other hand, had a beautiful time and am really looking forward to returning once the excitement boils over (is that ever gonna happen?)...

We were expecting a lengthy wait on post-holiday Black Friday, but we took advantage of the time to check out the Country Store for a bit. Once we were seated, bro and I ultimately decided our orders from top to bottom, put in our meals and drinks, and then....... the wait of eternity. Let's face it: this is the genesis of that triangular board peg game, and if you don't get into that (or have a fully charged smartphone), then, yes, indeed, this is going to be a PAINFULLY long wait. Not entirely unexpected, however; were you expecting a five-minute turnaround after having waited on rocking chairs outside for 2 hours???

Anyway, bro ordered the dinner sampler platter and I opted for Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast and sweet tea. Unfortunately the one thing I missed in all the excitement were the items \"on request.\" So... no bread, no apple butter :( I'm sure glad my bro asked for water!

Everyone helping us was kind and efficient and very cool. Although the food did take a lengthy period of time, I can't say we weren't taken care of! Plus the food itself came out nice and fresh: meatloaf was actually tasty (sorry I'm not a huge fan of American meatloaf), chicken n' dumplings were PERFECTION, country ham was delicious, my country fried steak was awesome, as were my biscuits, gravy (a tiiiiny bit salty but still yum), and all our other sumptuous sides. Bro opted for a baked sweet potato that *may* have been the least desirable piece of our full meal, but even then it was decent. Personally one of my favorites was the fried apples!

Anyway, we were only in Vegas for the day so we HAD to make our one and only meal in town epic. So happy Cracker Barrel was able to fulfill that destiny! Thank you, sweet hostess standing outside in the cold, super chill servers, and tchotchkies-stuffed Country Store for making our Thanksgiving weekend superb!"}
{"text":"I have only eaten at Cracker Barrel once before, but this was just as I remember it - amazing! I was unclear on what I wanted I guess & the waitress didn't see me point to what I wanted, so there was a mixup. But she promptly fixed my order so I could try the most delicious whole grain oatmal pancakes. Great service, delish food, and they have such a great shop - I wish I could buy everything."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! The best Cracker Barrel we've been to."}
{"text":"I am kind of a fan of the Cracker Barrel. I love the vintage vibe of the restaurant and there are games at the table for distraction while you wait for the food. The cornbread and buttermilk biscuit is soo delicious! Soft and melts in your mouth. The fried catfish was okay and I really liked the hash brown casserole and mac and cheese. Overall, good times. The store was such a treat with throwback and large size candies and the whole store was all decorated for Christmas already."}
{"text":"Good food and nice staff. Great place to go and enjoy dinner.. The wife and I enjoy a kid free night eating by the fire place.. Not to say it's not kid friendly. Our kids love to eat there!!!"}
{"text":"So my family and I have eaten at Cracker Barrel many times through the years. We went there last night and had a really bad experience at this restaurant. After 20 minutes of taking our order they came back to let us know one of the dishes was unavailable. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to get our food and the restaurant was not even a quarter full. They seem to be fully staffed at evening and when I asked about why we had to wait they did not give me any real reason."}
{"text":"We waiting long time to get served, long time to get the food I ask for coke and was flat, they offer to replace for ice tea soda machine wasn't work, Had to talk to a very rude manager Steve, he just absolutely couldn't change my eggs for hashbrown casserole. Even though I get this option every time. Wasn't very patient. Waitress was very nice! Helpful staff"}
{"text":"I was very excited to stop at Cracker Barrel because we don't have them in California. Despite a kinda long wait the service was great. The food was awesome. Gravy could have used a little more flavor but wasn't horrible. But their hash brown casserole was great. The biscuits were so fresh. Also as a side note at the check out they mention a portion of there November sales was going a nonprofit that supports Injured veterans. Not sure if that means anything to people anymore but that was huge for me."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Their check in system skipped us and after the 15 minutes wait time i was told, I finally had to ask and they didn't have our name down. We waited about 20 minutes for drinks. Food was an hour or so. Kids drinks tasted awful. Water instead. Great pancakes."}
{"text":"This was pur first time eating here. The employees were very friendly and we loved all the vintage decorations around the restaurant. Our waitress was very nice and explained everything to us. The food was amazing!!"}
{"text":"First time here at Cracker barrel in bout 3 years only because there is not one close. Visited Vegas and could not miss a trip to this southern themed restaurant. A few years ago I ate thanksgiving dinner here 2 years straight. I was raised in North Carolina and Cracker Barrel is our food basically. 

On this trip, We ate breakfast and was not disappointed. I love the sampler. So much food and under 10 bucks. You get bacon, sausage, ham, hashbrown casserole. Grits, apples, biscuits n gravy and a full stomach. Lol..The coffee and hot Chocolate was great too. My kids had buttermilk pancakes, very good and filling. My wife and I had the sampler. The service was great and we took home apples, apple butter and coffee from the store.  We put our name in the wait list ahead of time and had a 1 minute wait...we drove 4.5 hours and Cracker Barrel was our first stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"ILOVETHECRACKERBARREL!!!!!!!!!!!! 

The Cracker Barrel has been a family \"bon voyage\" breakfast staple. When ever we go to visit the parents or they come to visit us, on the last day we always end up at the CB for breakfast! 

I always get the Sunrise Sampler because you get a little bit of everything! 
That heavenly hash brown casserole is INSANE, I could eat it for the rest of my life! true story! 

The grits, with the warm maple syrup and gobs of butter, yummmm! 

The baked apples.GAH! 

The biscuits and gravy, lord have mercy! 

The smoked Sausage! I always ask for all sausage, And skip the one piece of bacon and one piece of ham, pile on that tasty sausage please! 

The eggs are a after thought for me and fill in the blanks while I am trying to figure out what to eat next! 

The service is always great! We are generally a table of 6-12 people, and they always get our order right."}
{"text":"I like Cracker Barrel - just not this location.  This was our first visit to the recently opened restaurant here in Las Vegas.  There was no wait - good timing.  Had we arrived just 20 minutes later, our wait would have been 45 minutes on a weekday morning.
The server was polite but it was \"her Monday\", so the service wasn't even close to good.  The food - well, it was probably the worst that we've had in quite some time.  Eggs were overcooked, Hashbrown casserole was undercooked but the top was dried out and hard.  Biscuits were undercooked and kind of gooey, and the sawmill gravy tasted like it was just made from a mix.  
if our choice is going to this location again or driving 2 hours or more to get to another one, looks like we are going on a road trip to either AZ or UT."}
{"text":"We went back tonight and I have to say again this place is amazing. I had my three children plus my niece and nephew and spent only 50 bucks..I mean we ate very well!! I had the Sunday special which was two chicken breast and three sides and that chicken was amazing! Big and juicy and yes it was deep fried!!! This place is amazing not to mention the retail side that just calls to you as your leaving!! Lol"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Hostess does not listen to any detail when spoken to. The restaurant itself is so dusty you cant enjoy your meal thinking i have dust and dirt in my food because of how dirty it is inside. The food YUCK...greasy Fries and DO not order any veggies...The windows are filthy, finger prints, what looked like snot, dirt and dust this was all on the inside."}
{"text":"Great food amazing atmosphere ! Loved it ! Everything is so fresh! My favorite are eggs sunny side up and they made them just right!"}
{"text":"The BEST breakfast I ever ate!!! Soooooo GOOD!!!! My family enjoyed everything. The service was AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, not so good service! We sat for about ten minutes before the server came to take our drink order and our food was brought out at different times. I was had finished my food while my daughter was still waiting for the rest of her meal( a muffin and yogurt!)"}
{"text":"I normally rate only places I like, and let the bad ones figure out their own problems.  Being a Californian, we do not have any in California as of yet.  Returning from a vacation, and getting near lunch we saw the sign advertising CB.  We got off the I-15 and found the place quickly.  There was a short wait, no big deal, and we got seated.  Being about 11am, I decided to have breakfast.  The place was so noisy we could hardly hear each other talk......no big deal, it is a well known restaurant and on a Saturday morning.  I look at the menu and overall was very disappointed in the breakfasts.  I finally select a dish that was two eggs and a biscuit, I thought the biscuit had gravy, but must have not read correctly, I also order a small side order of bacon.  I get the order and there is one biscuit, about the size of refrigerated canned biscuit and two eggs that looked like they were dropped on the counter and then put back on the plate.  Disclaimer, I like my eggs over hard, so some of my criticism is understandable.  These eggs were the most rubbery, hard to cut and as I said rubbery to chew I have EVER eaten.  The bacon was two slices of non-descript meat.  I eat what I want and normally don't worry about the cost, but for a screwed up two eggs that I would never put out to a customer and a couple of small bacons, I felt I was screwed.  The 2 eggs and a small biscuit were $4.89 and the bacon was $3.09, so for just under $8, I had a perfectly terrible breakfast.  I feel I will never go back to another Cracker Barrel in my life unless I am stranded and hungry."}
{"text":"I suggest you avoid this restaurant at all costs. Tonight was the first and last time that my family will eat at this establishment. The service was extremely slow, the food was luke warm or cold and refills of water and other beverages had to be requested more than once. To make matters worse, a family of five was seated next to our party where almost every member of the party was coughing uncontrollably. All of my family members (including my 90+ year old mother) are extremely worried that we may have been put in harms way with potentially contracting TB or whooping cough or some other severe respiratory disease from these individuals. After paying for our bill, I asked to speak to a manager about our experience. Unfortunately, this individual didn't appear to understand her leadership role and what it takes to instill confidence in her customers. She kept repeating that she was sorry, and she would pass along the feedback to her general manager. As if that was going to improve our experience and overall impression of this restaurant! There are too many choices in this retail/restaurant complex to settle for mediocre food and service from this establishment."}
{"text":"Well its Cracker Barrel if you don't know what you are getting I can't help you ha. This location is like all the others and produces good quality food. 

While they say country food like chicken and meatloaf it lacks the seasoning of a mom and pop southern place. They definitely appeal to their base of children, and older diners. 

I do like that as you travel they are consistent. 

My fav thing is the oven baked chicken breast. It comes with seasoned veggies or steamed broccoli and a choice of one side. It is pretty healthy for a casual dinning restaurant. 

The only reason I give this location 4 stars is the service is up and down. Sometimes good sometimes just ok at best. It has never been our right bad."}
{"text":"Always love the breakfast here. I love the fact that you can go to any location and get the same quality and service. Love the pancakes."}
{"text":"Sometimes my gent and I just don't have the patience to wait an hour for a brunch place and want something quick, cheap, and reliable. Enter the Cracker Barrel.

CB is a place I saw on every road trip as a kid but not a place we ever stopped. A Cracker Barrel-obsessed pal and I went a few years ago and I was actually really impressed with the quality and quantity of food I got for about $8. 

Last year I returned to Cracker Barrel in a hangry fit for breakfast and it's been a semi-regular stop since. On my last visit I got biscuits and gravy, deliciously crispy bacon, and a slice of hashbrown casserole for $7.69. Most certainly not a healthy start to the day but it kept me full for about eight hours. My lunch/dinner pick is usually the chicken tenders and a rotation of sides - always amounting to enough for two meals. 

At this location service has always been invariably friendly - some of the older ladies seem to genuinely love their job and the younger servers, while not as passionate, are good. 

The store is an entertaining way to pass the time while you wait for a table - there's mini air hockey and so many things to smell (candles, lotions, sprays, and more). Bathrooms have been clean enough. 

Minor issues: due to how massive the restaurant is it's sometimes a while before you can find your server if you need something. The cashiers can sometimes be aloof; for example, on my last visit there were three people behind the checkout counter and only one person running a register. The other two were chatting and oblivious to the line building up. Someone skipped the line and walked straight up to the next open register and that snapped the chit-chatters out of their convo, but that meant those of us that had been waiting still had to wait. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Cracker Barrel. They are everywhere down south along with a reputation of biased service.  So, I held my breath and fought against the suggestion to eat there.  I finally gave in  and boy I'm glad that I did. What an experience, first you walk into the restaurant down a porch with rocking chairs for sale. Upon entering the place it's a general store with all kinds of country things for sale. Cute, cute, cute. The front end person takes you inside the restaurant which is colorfully decorated with old-timey antiques and signs like frim the show American Pickers.  
Anyway, our server Zachary was pleasant and informative. We went with the fish N chips and the chicken salad. Everything was prepared fast and hot. We even tried the biscuits and they were fluffy and perfect.
I'm a foodie and this place has good food. The prices are reasonable also. I'm glad that I took a chance on this place. Next time I will post pictures.."}
{"text":"This was the worst cracker barrel experience. The food was not good and it came to us very piecemeal. The staff was ok but not the friendly over the top customer service we have come to expect. However, the store clerks were very nice and helpful. Very disappointed in the restaurant. An interesting observation. This is the very first time I have been to a cracker barrel that wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I hate given them a one star HOWEVER. Waiters or waitresses. Don't call people honey or sweetie it's so unprofessional. It's just not professional sir or ma'am stick with that"}
{"text":"This place has amazing comfort food! It was a nice atmosphere and great service. I would definatly come back!"}
{"text":"Fun restaurant and shop. Our waitress was phenomenal. Not the best place for a vegan. Everything has butter, cream or meat. Ended up getting a sweet potato and a side salad."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I got the Southern Trout off the Wholesome Fixin's menu with mixed seasonal vegetables and baked sweet potato as my sides.  It came with butter and brown sugar to sprinkle on top.  I also ate a cornbread muffin with butter, too.  

The waitress asked if we wanted cornbread or biscuits before bringing them to the table, which I thought was a nice touch so they don't waste food if the customer doesn't want them.  

Delicious food, friendly staff, and a fun atmosphere with knick knacks and stuff adorning the walls and for sale in the country store.  I wish they had Cracker Barrel out in California.  It's truly a fabulous place.  :)"}
{"text":"First visit to Cracker Barrel, probably last visit. Took my teenage boys to try this place out.. First it was very busy that's a good sign expected a wait to be seated, very confusing where you need to go. First you go in and it's a airport gift shop that sells candy to dishes and clothing. 30 min wait I'm ok with that went outside to rock on the wooden rocking chairs to hear my name called to be seated.. We get in, very loud and tight seating, place our order 35 minutes later no appetizers nothing to eat. Bring us our order it's wrong, 5 minutes retry order it's 75% right but all mixed up on different plates. Steamed broccoli they forgot to steam it. Ask 3 different people to bring us salt pepper and ketchup and one was the manager never got them. Our steak fries were given to us 20 minutes after food was served. Now it's time to leave with all 3 of us not that impressed or happy the way the dinner was served. We were asked when going through the gift shop to pay bill if everything was ok. I said to them we left most of the food on plate as it was served to us late and inconsistent. Really a bad first visit. I felt the $45.00 I spent was a bad value. They need to take care of customers when they get this type of service."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel !! 
There is usually a wait on Saturday & Sunday but I feel that it is so worth it. I love their pancakes and hash brown casserole. My food has always been nice and hot so, no complaints here.

Keep up the good work guys!!!"}
{"text":"Megan the hostess got a new tattoo on her left forearm!! She was most concerned that all customers were made aware.  Top priority!!

Given a 35 minute wait estimate, after an hour we left without service. See below:

Arrival.....
Host: name please?
Me: Paula
Host: Colin?
Me: no, Paula 
Host: what?
Me: P a u l a T. 
Host: ok, there's a 35 minute wait.
Me: ok, thank you. 

After all that, and spelling my name for him, somehow my name was added to their app/list as Paul T.   Ok, close enough. 

We browse through the shop area and hear Megan call out, \"table is being prepared for Paul T.\"  I head over to her podium. She doesn't ask my name but quickly tells me to stand to the side because it'll still be about approx 10 minutes.  Ok, no worries. I understand as I've also worked in restaurants. 

Waiting, waiting, waiting. Others who checked in after us are being seated.  Ok, More waiting. I ask her to check on my name, Paula T. or Paul T. 
She's too busy looking @ the new tattoo and putting creme on it. 
She finally says, \"your table isn't ready yet\".
Okay, I ask her to at least check for my name clarification. She didn't. 
She's very busy, but telling customers that this is slow compared to most Sunday mornings so it's no big deal. She's used to it.  I approach again to inquire about name clarification because it's been almost an hour at this point.  
She says, \"oh table for Lupe\"? 
No, Paula T. or Paul T. because my name wasn't properly input by the first host outside at the front door. I'm trying to explain to her. She insisted my name must be Lupe because there is no Paula or Paul on her tablet.  
Wait a minute, you called Paul T about 30m ago so......???? 
At this point she was looking but says nobody named Paul or Paula has checked in. I remind her that she called it about 30m ago.  If she'd have listened to me, I could have explained it.  

Cutting off customers as they speak is highly inappropriate. Customer service 101.  
Besides the name mix up she should have at least acknowledged that my husband and I both had been standing in her area for a long time. 

A good hostess would pick up on that, not Megan though.  Her new tattoo was the most important thing for her. 

Left without service. 
Won't be back. 
CB manager, please retrain Megan. 

P.s., I have nothing against tattoos. 
I think they're great."}
{"text":"They really do have the best breakfast.... and Sunday fried chicken... and biscuits"}
{"text":"Today were celebrating my Aunt Betty as she is 64 every thing in our meal was fabulous. This was my first time there today and I guarantee that I will be returning!  Wait staff is truly admirable.  The gift shop had really cute and old fashioned items. It was a lot of fun  discussing with family!  Kudos !!"}
{"text":"Taking an order and putting the list of things in a bag seems like a fairly easy job, yet this place consistently proves that theory incorrect.

They always forget something major in my carryout order that inevitably leaves me giving up my breakfast to free me up to be angry - for example, today, we ordered biscuits and sausage gravy and got no biscuits but two extra orders of grits (we did not order grits). Its a sad thing to see someone eating sausage gravy witha fork. 

You stink, Cracker Barrel. You stink."}
{"text":"I love the Cracker Barrel. Used to drive hours to eat there before Vegas locations opened. They train everyone pretty well on service and they are always adequately staffed. I think the food is delicious and priced low. My favorite is sugar cured ham! Go there you'll love it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cracker Barrel, but the experience we had today at this location was just bad. I was surprised and disappointed. Our service was bad and the food was bad. We had to flag down waitresses for everything - they didn't give us straws for drinks (kids drinks have kids so needed straws), didn't bring water even after a second request (my husband never got a water throughout the entire meal) didn't bring the sides that came with the meals, put the country gravy on the fried shrimp instead of on the mashed potatoes (fried shrimp smothered with country gravy is disgusting if you ever wondered), and the list goes on. We pretty much had to ask for everything that they should have brought, and then got tired of asking so just gave up. And the food, which is usually good, was not. One waitress said they had a new person working the back and was messing everything up. Worst grits I've ever tasted. All together bad experience, and then they forgot to give us a receipt when we paid. My husband just gave up at that point. Not like back home at all."}
{"text":"Had my first visit at this location and I must say from the time we walked in, to the time we left, the service and atmosphere was GREAT! 

Our waiter, Laquan, kept the Customer in Customer service and made the best suggestions of what to try!  LOVED IT ALL!!!Will definitely be back and will be asking for his section!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon at about noon for some late breakfast. The wait was about 20 minutes but with all the fun games, the store, and great outdoor sitting area time flew by. I have never been to a Cracker Barrel before and did not expect my breakfast to be as delicious as it was. My eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly, and the fried apples are so good. It is worth the wait and great place to get some cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Just left and it was amazing. Food is delicious like always and super affordable. The decoration is so cute."}
{"text":"Have not eaten at Cracker Barrel in years, (back when they had a big menu with to die for meals). The haddock was good as were the biscuits, but me being a grits lover, have to say they were the worst grits I have ever eaten in my 55 years!! Watery...no salt and cheese melted to a crisp on top, yuck! Unseasoned veggies to go with it and a salad big enough for a 5 year old. Hubby was not impressed with his sirloin either. Too far  to drive for a substandard meal...we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this location. The staff is always friendly and seem happy to be there. We've had the server named Cynthia twice and she is the BEST. Such a sweet lady with a kind presence, we love when we get her. Just overall a great place everytime."}
{"text":"Food was horrible. Service was mediocre. Atmosphere was alright. 

My boyfriend dragged me here since we were on the road and needed some food to get us through the long trip. You enter into a little country store that was cute but over priced. Then we went into the restaurant part. Service was super slow even though half the tables were empty. Took forever to get water. 

Our food took about 45 min and tasted like crap. I got bbq chicken with broccoli and a sweet potato. The chicken was lacking in flavor and moisture. The sweet potato was more like a cup of brown sugar with a bit of potato. Disgusting. The broccoli was good at least and the only thing I actually ate.

I won't be going back. No matter how stranded and hungry we are."}
{"text":"We were here on a Monday morning, I tried the online wait list before we arrived and it said only 10-15 wait.... we arrived went to the hostess and she said 20 min wait, I waited just as long as people walked up so the online wait list is a waste... wasn't even crowded 35 min wait when we were seated 15-20 min  for anyone to take our order for drinks when she came I gave them our drink and food order, drinks took another 30 min and food was about 45 min... the thing is , it wasn't even crowded there were empty table around us?? Food was good but the wait isn't worth it for me :("}
{"text":"This is the most unorganized Cracker Barrel I've ever been too. I don't know if it's because it's the only one out in Las Vegas and they have no support.  But I can't think of anything that would bring me back there.  Poor service food. Everything terrible"}
{"text":"If you want some good ol' fashioned country home cookin, this is the place for you. Biscuits n gravy, french toast, pancakes, big strips of bacon, sausage etc etc. I always love Cracker Barrel a) the cute gift/knick knack shop in the front, b)always good food and c) they don't have them in Cali!!!. They seriously need to open one here and I don't know why they haven't. It's always great to people watch here too. Service was good. Got us drinks fast, food fast and check fast. But, didn't rush us out of there. Another great thing about Cracker Barrel is the price. You get so much food for so little. But, I couldn't eat here all the time. Definitely once in awhile kind of joint. :)"}
{"text":"Called to place a to go order and was told 4 times I'd be transferred. After 10 min of being transferred and put on hold I was hung up on. I understand they are busy but you normally have dedicated workers to take orders. So I ended up going to a different business and will not return to this location"}
{"text":"Gotta love Cracker Barrell. Well, I guess you don't HAVE to but I like it. I would probably always order the Turkey Dinner but they only serve in on Thursdays...Aaahhh! So I usually go for the meatloaf. Makes me laugh but reminds me of when I was little. Tonight I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken, so we'll see. I like the little store - it's nice to walk around and distract you while you're waiting. Unfortunately the kids always want to buy something but oh well."}
{"text":"Food was really good! Server asks if everything's ok plenty. But doesn't notice empty glasses.  Other than that, awesome restaurant.  Will return if we are ever out here again."}
{"text":"Last time I was at a Cracker Barrel I was in Kansas, cake here and it did not disappoint! I like that they make everything as delicious as in Kansas! Staff is really friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Place was clean, friendly service and felt just like what I grew up with traveling the southeast on family vacations.

Pics look good but the eggs were under cooked, hash browns not well done as requested. Gravy cold. 

My two year old loves the place, wife wasn't thrilled with the coffee. 

Fun place to stop maybe lunch would be better :-)"}
{"text":"I had the ribeye with a salad and some carrots. It was cooked as I asked but a bit salty.  The carrots were ok but very sweet. I enjoyed my salad.. It was very fresh.  It was an ok meal but I wasn't too impressed.  My colleagues had the pot roast, chicken and dumplings and biscuits and corn bread, they were happy with their meals. Our server was attentive. My biggest problem was that the ladies room was dirty and desperately needed attention, I hate a dirty restroom, makes me wonder about the rest of the place.  Not the type of restaurant I frequent often and definitely wasn't my choice.  More of a family type restaurant with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere for the country dining experience. Scratch made mashed potatoes, and they say the same for the rest of the menu. Everything is homemade. But. The pot roast was separate from the veggies. May be a personal preference but I prefer mine cooked together for the flavor. Service was excellent. Chicken livers were overcooked, hard and crunchy. 

I was able to buy Divinity Candy at the checkout counter. Nobody there knew what it was but at least they had it in stock and it is good. $4.99 for a half pound package. Next time I'll get the large pecan log with Divinity rolled  inside."}
{"text":"One of my favourite old style American restaurant. I visit at least once a month. Price is cheap and food is good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for Hometown Food. The Country Store at slots and novelties and knickknacks great place to pick up souvenirs glad they finally made it to Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing! Service was awesome! Our waiters name was Julian, he was very attentive and gave great suggestions. Every staff member was friendly even considering the massive amount of people there. I expected a two hour wait so I got there early (4pm-we planed on eating at 6pm.  I was given a 50 min wait time but I only waited about 40 mins before they called my name. My party of two more wasn't there yet so I asked if I could be bumped down until everyone was there (in Vegas, believe me...this never happens) however because they were awesome they allowed me to notify them when my party arrived and when we were all accounted for we were seated right away. The food was great, exactly how I remember from living in Missouri when I first started going to CB. The only thing I would suggest is please look into misters for summer and heat lamps for the winter. ;)"}
{"text":"Are here a few days after it opened! Our waitress Karen was amazing - she came out from Georgia just to help open the new store. She went above and beyond to get our whole party, 4 adults and 2 kids, exactly what we needed. Food was on point, even with a lot of modifications and ordering of things custom made. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Got here around 3:30 pm. It was crowded, but I've seen it worse. The hostess seats us right away. Out of habit at this particular Cracker Barrel, we always time how long it takes a wait staff to come up to your table. During this time other tables are coming in from 2 people, up to a party of 8. They was being served their drinks and even a couple of tables even their food. Shortly after we had been seated.  25 minutes later and still no one had come to our table. My sister asks another server could he please get someone to come to our table. He didn't know who was taking care of our table. So he went and got the manager. 
 Then he came up, \" no how long have you been waiting or I'm  so sorry this happened\".  We just wanted him to acknowledge I'm sorry about this and let me get this right for you. Yeah not so much.  He never came back by to see if we had been taken care of or anything.  Just what do you want to drink. And someone will be with you. This isn't the first time that it's so scattered brained with the service. But today it was so much worse than ever. 
 So a girl comes with our drinks. Take our orders. Then another 40+ minutes the food still hasn't come out and lost sight of the server. Never got refills on our drinks. When she finally brought our food out, I asked for a cup of ice to add to my drink. At this rate I wasn't sure if I wouldn't see her again. Which the ice was finally brought out when we had almost finished our meals. 
 Asked for a box and that took another  10 minutes to bring that out. I just don't understand what in the world was going on. Tried to give this location chance after chance. I believe we will be moving on to a different location."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel makes EVERYTHING from scratch.  I know this because my son got his University degree by working at two different ones, and he's a total foodie today.
I can say I have never had a bad meal there, BUT when you go right after lunch and they have already run out of the daily special pot pies on a Wednesday--ok, I get that one--but they also ran out of the apple cobbler dessert which is not one of the specials....well, tsk, tsk,..bad planning.
So, I am deleting one star for the running out of food.  This particular Cracker Barrel is located across from Westgate Mall, so I think that is why it is so popular.  Still and all, the Manager should know how much to order for the crowds he gets, and this has happened before when I went there with someone.
People:  Not sure whether to thank you for eating all those fantastically delicious apple cobblers with ice cream for me (I don't need them and shouldn't be eating them anyway) or to be irritated that they run out all the time.
However, the food at Cracker Barrel really is good in general.  Eat there!  But leave some apple cobbler for me!!!!"}
{"text":"Kid worked here while in college, so here's the real story:  All food including salad dressing is homemade.  Probably so good as it gets for homemade food on the go.
Can't think of anywhere else to go....go to the Barrel."}
{"text":"Visited your Cracker Barrel today for dinner. Loved the Chicken platters and green beans . Thanks for making the perfect atmosphere for us."}
{"text":"Mmm Cracker Barrel.  Home style food without the work, dirty dishes, hot kitchen, setting the table, spilled milk, or arguments over the dinner table.  
Okay, it's sorta like that.
I seriously like the biscuits here -the cornbread, not so much cuz I can make it 10 times better.  
Favorite entree here is the chicken n dumplins.  Mmm mmm MMM!
Grits - good
Collard greens - good
Dumplins - really good
Chicken in the chicken n dumplins -  s'alright.
The chicken is clearly cooked separately from the dumplins and it's apparent in the flavor and appearance.  

Overall, still a reliable restaurant with consistently good, down to earth, Mom & Pop, home style cookin'.
And the service is generally alright too."}
{"text":"Always love eating here. Reminds me of old school country comfort food that grandma use to make when I was little. Breakfast is always a treat with traditional style flap jacks that that the little crunch around the edges but they are so fluffy and good in the middle. The cornbread and biscuits are always great. Very consistent place."}
{"text":"Sweet, speedy service! Our waiter, Shane was such a great person, he took our order and recommended a few items. The food was spot on! I very much enjoyed the biscuits and gravy. As well as the atmosphere, very scenic with vintage art pieces and knick knacks! Definitely on the list to be back and try their dinner specials!"}
{"text":"Long wait extremely long wait to get our food. Everything tasted exactly the same. Burnt! Service was OK."}
{"text":"Great meal. The best part of it is the awesome service of Vivian. Tentative, attention to details, timely, friendly, and professional. All meal details were accurate with no discrepancies . Keep her."}
{"text":"Ewwwwwww, they had the audacity to slip me ...no, no, no.... proudly sell me some greens that tasted like silver. I told my mother and she blankly stated \"....Because they didn't clean them....\"

Ran this by the Bestie and he said exactly the same. 
It's been almost a year later and I can barely make myself go over again for mistreatment to the highest degree. That happened after Xmas and it's now September and I'm just getting around to alerting the public. Please note: that's just how struck I was."}
{"text":"Best experience at a Queen City Cracker Barrel to date. 

My to go order was separated as I requested. Manager came out to double check that I had all my items. Order taker over the phone was mannerable, attentive and apologized after we got disconnected and I had to call back. 

Fish fried crispy without having to stress this matter. Meal was made great by all the service people who cared about their jobs and it showed. 

Order arrived promptly without complaint."}
{"text":"I would really like to thank the manager and the awesome staff for being so extremely helpful to our family. Helping us get my grandmother in and out of the restaurant coming home from the hospital, it was the only place she craved as a meal. They went above and beyond on there service and dedication on making my Grandmother feel at home. 
              Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

{"text":"My husband and I have eaten at Cracker Barrels since 1986 when we moved from Chicago to Chattanooga, TN. A few years later, we migrated to Boynton Beach in South Florida. In 1998, we moved to Phoenix. Luckily every where we've lived in 31 years, there's been a Cracker Barrel.  They used to have a rewards card but stopped that years ago. Being from the Midwest, we discovered their fried okra, hash brown casserole, grits, pecan pancakes, real maple syrup, chicken fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, and sawmill gravy with biscuits. Be sure to ask your server when you order, for apple butter to put on some biscuits. It's delicious! Save room for warm blackberry cobbler a la mode for dessert. Afterwards plan on burning some calories walking around Cracker Barrel's country store brimming with old- fashioned candy, jars of certain food items, their real Vermont maple syrup, books on audio tape and a trade-in program from store to store, Yankee candles, jewelry, greeting cards, tshirts, unusual seasonal decorative items only found at Cracker Barrels, attractive tops for women, old time toy section for children, old time sodas in a cooler, etc. There's a clothing discounted rounder in the back of the stores with a variety of clothing items-- tshirts, blouses, skirts, capes, etc. Allow a little time to sit a spell and enjoy the Cracker Barrel (CB) rockers outside on the front covered patio, too. The service is always good and the teamwork they demonstrate is incredible! A server is always walking down the aisles with coffee or tea pitchers asking if they can fill your drinks (even if they're not your server). I took a friend of mine to CB for the first time about 3-4 weeks ago. Amazing! If you've never eaten at a Cracker Barrel before, please look for the nearest one in your area. There's one on Chandler Boulevard just West of the I-10 overpass. The manager and staff there are very friendly and make your dining experience a pleasant one. The fireplace is going during these cool months, too."}
{"text":"The bomb!! I will be back next VEGAS trip! The wait on a Sunday was 1:40 minutes - but I'm telling you it was worth it!"}
{"text":"stop here on the way home. ordered a sweet tea and chicken and dumplings. very good, i would order them both again. and you gotta love the country store."}
{"text":"As always good to go!  Great hometown kind of food, atmosphere and even service. Had the Lemmon trout with steak fries and sweet corn, oh my goodness my sweet momma popped in my head. Wife had the homestyle \"don't let your\" Meat Loaf with carrots and mash potatoes. She gives it a 4 star rating. Hey, I'm from the south so you know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, where to start. Well the wait wasnt bad since its New...and the staff is getting their niche. They couldve made the Store a lil bit bigger...especially when theres people in wheel chairs and scooters and children and of course Hefty people (like myself). Anyhow, they called my name for Our table, not bad...wish they had cushion for the chair...lol. Our server didnt smile until i cracked a joke but soo slow and not personable. We ordered and wrote our order correct but some how got lost in translation for my hubbys order. Okay Cooks/Line people listen up...my hubby and i are in the restaraunt biz, How would u feel if ur order was Wrong?!? Hmmm yeah, We told our server about the order, she apologized and was willing to take it back, we kno how that works...lol. And waiting for our refills on our drinks being out on the edge of the table, Granted its busy yes But at least come by and ask even if its Not Your Section...its called Team Work! One server did refill my tea but Not my hubbys and boy was he Mad. We waited a lil longer but Nothing. So i said lets go! I love the store while we waited. Im willing to go back coz it reminds me of when i was a kid and my family would have meals like this when my dad was stationed in Maine and we would go state hopping to visit family. For my Hubby, first and last time...sorry!"}
{"text":"First time at any location. Great country atmosphere with the general store and old style decor. We were sat promptly and the entire staff was courteous and helpful. We ordered both breakfast and lunch dishes. 

Didn't care for the grits or the gravy, but everything else kicked ass! Crispy fat bacon, sausage patties, pancakes, hash browns, Mac and cheese, WHoah!  Would definitely come back to try something else (or get the same thing)."}
{"text":"We visited on MLK day.  Was happily surprised to arrive and there not be a wait. We were seated quickly and by cheerful staff. 

How can you go wrong with the pancakes from Cracker Barrel? You can't! 
They are the most delicious flaky fluffy stacks of goodness ever and the warm bottles of syrup are full of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Poor service.  Every time I go to this one it seems I get the worst service ever.  Flat out - the food is amazing and you get served so much you don't need to eat for the rest of the day - but the service sucks .. these guys need a lesson in taking care of people, or hiring more competent staff."}
{"text":"I love this place! My favorite thing to order is their yogurt and biscuits/gravy. It always smells amazing in there and the gift shop is cute. I don't like the crowded feel, but everything else is nice and I've always been seated within 10-15 minutes upon my arrival. Bathrooms are clean and the music is lively."}
{"text":"The food and servers were excellent.   Water was always filled and our server offered to split our bill.  We were a group of 6 so that was awesome.  Three stars because the cashier checking us out was incredibly rude.  I didnt get her name but she had blonde hair pulled back and a perma scowl on her face.   I was looking at the air freshners at the end of the counter and she walked away from the guest she was helping and snatched up the basket from me without saying anything.  She knocked a sign down and basically looked to me to pick it up like I was the one who knocked it over. no sorry, thank you or nothing. I was going to buy some but decided not too. Managers should be aware if she is representing your establishment to guests her job title should be changed to somethimg that isnt customer service related.."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Cracker Barrel; fareham is yummy and potatoes are good and the store is a fun place for the kids to entertain themselves while spending all my money ( but that's part of being on vacation) . Today however I was entirely disappointed. I didn't have long for lunch so I ordered one of their quick entrees - chicken and dumplings. I suggest you never do that to yourself or anyone you love. Was clearly boiled chicken but that's okay because there wasn't much of it. Dumplings were flat and rectangular and tasted very floury, so while they look like enormous noodles they tasted like paste. The sauce was a weird kind of floury cream of chicken soup. No hint of celery or onions, herbs or spices; just salt,chicken, and flour. But the waitress was amazing and the side dishes were delicious so it wasn't a total loss. I'll probably be back but not for the chicken and dumplings! And"}
{"text":"We've been to this location several times since they've opened in Las Vegas. We usually have a large party of 8 or more. Always very friendly service all around. Great food at a reasonable price. We're still so happy to have Cracker Barrel here in town! Love the food! While there usually is a bit of a wait to be seated they have that cute little store to shop around in while you're waiting."}
{"text":"Do not recommend this place. I absolutely love Cracker Barrel and have eaten and enjoyed it in about 4 different states. Ordered a to-go order and they said it would take 10-15 mins. It was a simple one meal order of the grandpas breakfast meal. After 30 minutes I asked the status of my order and they said that they were bagging it... they finally came out after 5 more mins. To top it off the food was cold.y worst Cracker Barrel experience out of around 20. Wish a manager would contact me, the experience and customer service was that bad."}
{"text":"Good service but the food was bland for me.  I had the rib eye steak it was ok but my broccoli was cold and not cooked enough.  Cornbread normally has a little bit of sweetness but this did not at all.   I guess I had my taste buds set for Rudy's but the line was too long so we came here.  Willing to try again maybe breakfast next time that looks really good."}
{"text":"My husband and I had gone to Cracker Barrel in the past in a different state, and were thrilled when we got one here in Las Vegas! We already knew about wait times and expected it. Not a big deal. So far, 5 stars.  The server was nice, well groomed, took our orders fairly quickly. So far so good! Then our food finally came out. I asked for more sweet tea please! I unrolled my silverware, very obviously sticky and dirty. So I grabbed someone and finally got a new set. No tea , but ok. Oh wait, there is almost no gravy on my mashed potatoes, can I have more gravy please? What? You want more gravy? I ate my whole meal, except for the mashed potatoes - oh here is more tea! Yummy! (Not really because it tasted like dirty hay) finally got the gravy, got the check before my hubby could ask for desert. He made sure to get it! A manager came right before we left, I wrote \"Bad Service\" on the back of the ticket so they would at least see that. He saw that and was all shocked. Ok look. I've been reading through the reviews. This place has bad service. The management should not be shocked. He offered to pay or do something- I said no thank you and went and paid our check and we left. The food was good. :) 

A suggestion of the management should read this. Go to Lucille's for dinner. Take notes. They work like a team. They have awesome service!! They are packed as well. Oh and get that tea for your clients. :) it is heaps better tasting! I know what sweet tea is supposed to taste like, not like yours. Lol!! Have a great day!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the hype about this place. Waited at least 30 minutes to be seated, another 30 minutes for food, which I wouldn't mind if the food was REALLY good, but I have to be honest, it was horrible!"}
{"text":"Wanted breakfast out on my day off. We came here. An as usual it felt like home. Got the Old timer! ( fitting name since im gettin old) lol!!! But the food is always good. Cooked to perfection just like i wanted it. Only thing is im use to a different type of biscuits an gravy!! Since all my people came from W.Va !! But it still was good!! The staff is truly awesome an seen the manager out checking on things alot. The front store was set up nicely an was clean of anything on the floors. Will definitely visit this location again and again!!"}
{"text":"If you've been to one Cracker Barrel, you've basically been to them all. Same layout, same general store vibe, same greasy spoon-inspired grub, and in this case, very happy employees. 

The service was good, the food was standard, and the price was right! Not a bad option if you're looking for something quick for breakfast and are staying nearby, but I wouldn't make this a destination by any means."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant to eat! Went here with my husband for his 67th birthday recently and the service was great as well. Jesse was very kind and although it was a little busy it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very good food so homemade ! I love their little shop they have nice things !!! Only thing is that a worker not sure if he was the manager but he was extremely rude ! He quickly seize the receipt in a very rude way from my hands and i told him i wanted to show u something on the receipt and his response was \"well then show me\" (rude voice)."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype about Cracker Barrel. An egg is an egg. Nothing special and wait time is ridiculous.  I realize this is a new restaurant, but they taste the same throughout  the country. People should support local restaurants, not chains. If you have never tried the Sunrise Cafe, go there. Food is much better."}
{"text":"Mentioned to cashier that it was my last Cracker Barrel since I was heading to Cali, and he says \"yeah no Cracker Barrel in California, corporate doesn't want to deal with their dang labor laws!\" And I say \"what's wrong with labor laws? I like the 8 hour workday! And that's okay... We have Roscoes Chicken and Waffles!\"

Three stars for being in Arizona."}
{"text":"The staff was super sweet but the kitchen kept messing our food up. I had to send my chicken back 2 times. First time it was raw inside & second time there were 2 hairs on top. When they brought it out the 3rd time I was so disgusted I couldn't even eat it. They messed up my husbands order as well. We have eaten at CB in Iowa & it was so so good. The food at this one just didn't taste the same. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"They opened one in California but, it's far from me. It's on the way to Vegas. I have always heard good things so I told my friend we should eat here on our way back from Vegas. She agreed! However, there was a couple in Vegas so we went to the one in Vegas on our way home. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately. It's a really cute place. We were given the menu and we look through it. My friend got the egg sandwich and added biscuits and gravy that comes with a side of bacon. The server suggested their sunrise plate that has a little of everything. I decided to get that. It came with 2 eggs cooked however you want, 1 bacon, 1 sausage, a piece of ham, hash browns and all their fixins' which includes, 2 biscuit and gravy, fried apple, and grits. 

My friend said her sandwich was good. It was a pretty basic sandwich. She added her bacon into it. 

My plate was blah. The eggs were fine obviously. I ordered it over medium. The sausage had a good flavor but, so dry. The bacon was good. It was nice and crispy. That's how I like my bacon. The sausage had a weird smell and it was really salty. I love salty but, this was a lot. The hash browns had a weird flavor. There was onions in it. I love onions but, it was odd. The grits were blah. I added salt and butter but, nope I couldn't do it. The biscuits were good but, the gravy lacked flavor. I added salt and pepper to it. The fried apple was a no go for me. It was too sweet. I didn't like the texture. 

Overall, the place is cute. The service is awesome. The food is better at Denny's. Lol I can say I tried it but, I will not return."}
{"text":"I agree with Chad E said about Cracker Barrel. If you're on a diet, don't go here. Im sure if they could fry their salad, they would. 

I have been here many many times and I haven't walked away disappointed. The only thing I don't like about it is the smoking section really isn't separated from the non-smoking (c'mon Jan 1st!). The wait staff is hit or miss, just depends on how many stars your waiter/tress has on their apron. A warning, when being seated, don't sit next to the fireplace, it's really hot.

I love their Wild Maine Blueberry pancakes. You get 4 pancakes loaded with blueberries and blueberry syrup that's warmed up and has blueberries in it. So basically, death by blueberries but it 's so good. Their hash brown casserole is pretty good too, just hopefully they chill out on the onions. The chicken tenderloin plate is very filling, they give you about 6 really big chicken strips, and 3 sides. I normally go for the hash brown casserole, mac n cheese, and green beans. All are full of flavor believe it or not and pair that with biscuits and \"country gravy\", you're all set. I never finish my entire meal because they give you so much food! The best part is, I normally can walk out of there for $24 for 2 people."}
{"text":"Blueberry pancakes. Sausage patties. Hashbrown casserole. Iced tea. Scrumpdiddlyumptiousness. Sometimes I wish the wait was longer, so I could enjoy browsing the store longer! It's not the place for a cheap breakfast, but it is definitely worth it. Service is averagely good and friendly, but on occasion a little slow, understandably when they are busy. And every once in a while, my pancakes are kinda raw in the middle, probably due to the blueberry overload, so I just eat around it. No biggie and nothing to knock a star for."}
{"text":"Over rated.

Food was mediocred and the wait was too long.  There are too many restaurants in Las Vegas that sells the mom and pop menu without the long wait.

I was very excited when I ordered the fried shrimp dinner. Breading was really over cooked and dried. Shrimp was small too small.

Biscuits was undercooked and corn bread was really dry.  

Again, I was disappointed when compared to Blue Berry and Black Bear restaurant.  At this point I would even say IHOP and Denny's is way better. Sad right?!

Go for the hyped, but lower your expectations and you'll be fine.

Otherwise it was an experience to try once."}
{"text":"- Good food
- Good service 
- Great atmosphere
- Reasonably priced
- Small parking lot

Food took awhile to come out but understandable as its was lunch time and was busy. Chicken fried chicken,  baked sweet potato, hash brown casserole and mac'n cheese. Overall was good,  the stand out was the mac'n cheese and baked sweet potato."}
{"text":"I don't know where they hire there cooks from they don't even know how to cook an over easy egg came out two times over hard.
The fried apples were mush.
I was not going to send it back three times.
You never know what you are going to get here.
Sometimes ok most the time bad I think they 
Hire anyone one for cooks.
They are not Chiefs that's for sure."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in town. Always being served, night or day. Try the chicken dumplings if you don't want breakfast."}
{"text":"Visit date 04/21/17 late lunch time. We got seated right away which is always nice. I can't remember our servers name but she was very attentive and told us the specials of the day- Friday's are fish fry days. My husband ordered a burger and I had the shrimp with hush puppies. Our server told us that it might be a wait since they were a little busy. We enjoyed the bread that was brought out. Our order arrived less than 10mins from when she had let us know. We were anticipating a longer wait! The food was great. I had the mac & cheese, coleslaw, & okra for my sides. I ended up giving the rest of my food to the hubby since I was full! The bill came to less than $30. 

The only issue I had was getting dirty looks from another server who was training someone. I had just finished getting another tattoo and these two people kept staring me down whenever they walked by. No one likes getting dirty looks from the staff when they are trying to enjoy a meal! 

No law enforcement discount."}
{"text":"This was the first Cracker Barrel I've been to- so nothing to compare it to.
Walking in, I felt like I was transported back to an easier time. I was greeted with smiling faces. The store inside was bright and filled with Knick knacks, candy, and clothing. I decided to eat first and check out the shop afterwards.

Service was overly nice and the restaurant was decorated beautifully. With the Christmas decorations up, it felt like it would start snowing any moment, even in the 70+ degree November weather.
Very large menu that was hard to choose from! I settled with chicken + dumplings w/ two sides and my bf got their special of the day, which was pork chops. I'm giving three stars because the food was mediocre. It seemed to me like cafeteria food. Bland sides that could use more seasoning. Dry chicken and pork chops.

I guess my expectations were raised after seeing how nice the place was. If only the food was as beautifully executed as the building, I would think of returning."}
{"text":"This location has NO sense of time! I checked in online and was told a 35 min wait. I get to the location & verify check in & told 20 min. I'm now at over an hour wait with a ton of excuses. Their manager doesn't even acknowledge unhappy customers. DO NOT waste your precious time coming here"}
{"text":"Food was cold the server didn't what they were doing ,, I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody rather go dennys"}
{"text":"i checked in online, what a joke
 this process does not work
 still had 30 min wait. the online check in said a 1o minute wait."}
{"text":"This is the worst Cracker Barrel I have ever visited.  
We were a party of four close to 7:00 pm for dinner.
They were not busy at all, yet it took forever to have our drink orders taken.  Refills were not given until all four of us were completely empty and we had to ask.  
They \"ran out of gravy\" and told me after they put my food on the table with the equivalent of an eye dropper full of gravy on my mashed potatoes and gravy and country fried steak and gravy.  Those menu items are not quite the same without the gravy.  Some of the sides arrived at our table late and cold.  I guess they wanted us to eat our meal in shifts.
When I spoke to the manager, he gave us free drinks and half off of one of our four meals as compensation for my trouble.  That was the absolute least he could do and still say he did something.
My family and I visit this area regularly and will be returning in a few weeks.  As convenient as this restaurant is to our usual hotel, we'll drive a few miles down the road to eat someplace better.
Avoid this place at all costs....I know I will.    
Pros:  Good location, convenient.
Cons:  Very slow, terrible customer service (could use some more training in this area,"}
{"text":"From walking in to walking out 1 hour 45 minutes. My husband had been wanting to try Cracker Barrel for a long time. We moved just up the street from one about 4 months ago. We finally had time to wait for a table there. We got there and played some chess outside, it was nice. We were called to our table finally! I ordered scrambled eggs and cheese with regular hash browns and bacon. My husband ordered eggs and pancakes. When our food finally came, my eggs had no cheese on them and my hash browns were casserole hash browns. I let the server know my order was incorrect. He took my plate to go fix the issue. Shortly after a manager came over and asked me why I wasn't eating. I said they messed up my order, as we were talking the server returned with the plate he took back to the kitchen and said I could eat that while I waited for them to correct my order. I wasn't happy about it at all after waiting that long. The eggs were gross. I didn't even try the hash brown casserole but my husband did, he made a weird face and said whats in those.. mushyyyy...  and the bacon was nothing i cant get somewhere else. So my \"corrected' order came out and the eggs were under cooked and runny!!!! So gross!!! and the hash browns were very under cooked as well and mushy, they seemed like frozen hash browns that thawed out and soaked up the water. Probably one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. A few minutes later the manager returned and asked me how my corrected order was. I showed her the runny eggs and hash browns. She said \"Would you like us to try again?\" I said no thank you. She mumbled something about an adjustment as she walked away. She seemed irritated. The server then came over and said ok guys you ate for free today. A totally free breakfast. We were like well. I guess it was alright for being free, at least they're trying to have us back for a second try. My husband was happy with his breakfast, but again said it wasn't anything we cant get somewhere else with better wait and prices, the food is nothing special, at least what we had. When we were ready to go we told the server we wanted to still leave him a tip. He said oh well you still have a bill for $20 and some change. We were still being charged for everything except the incorrect order and the inedible under cooked food they served me. It was an awful experience and I found the food I did eat very bland and gross. We will NEVER be returning to a Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel, but this location needs to fine tune a few things. 

1st off, when you say your order will be ready in 10-15 minutes, make it 10-15 minutes. The last few times I've come in at 15 minutes after placing my order, paid and then waited another 10-15 minutes.

2nd off, the Coca-Cola cake used to be extraordinary, but the last few times I've gotten it-I get a small corner cut where I have to throw half of it out because it is so disgustingly hard and gross.  Some days it's fresh and other days it tastes like it's been sitting out for a few hours or is a couple days old.

3rd, when I order the chicken tender salad I always ask for sliced tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes and they always splay ok. Until I get home and realize ok must've meant please ignore my special request because I get the cherry tomatoes anyways and end up throwing them all out. 

The chicken fried chicken is always good, as is the hashbrown casserole.  I will continue coming here because I feel like these small dissatisfactions can be rectified into satisfactions with a little more effort."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope. Expected Mother's Day to be busy that is why we planned our afternoon around an hour or hour and a half wait. Went over to Bass Pro, great to spend some time shopping before we eat. When we arrived back at Cracker Barrell we checked in again to see how much longer and to our surprise we would have to wait another hour:/ no where is good enough for a 2hr + wait. The manager then said \"the wait times are estimated.\" Really! Nope, nope, nope save your sanity and drive to St. George or Kingman and enjoy the drive dont waste your time at the Las Vegas version of Cracker Barrell!! Nope!"}
{"text":"Not the Cracker Barrel experience that I thought I would get compared to other Cracker Barrels. First of all everyone else got served drinks quickly and we had to wait a few minuets. We had to ask three times to have a fan turned off. Very poor customer service not what you would expect. I can't believe this is so bad on their 2nd day of opening."}
{"text":"Good homestyle food and decent value.  Staff was a little unmotivated but acceptable.  Meal was good."}
{"text":"My family and I usually visit this location for breakfast on Sunday mornings and we are a huge fan of their breakfast menu. In the past, their service was great and fast! The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because lately their customer hasn't been as great as it was before. Our food comes out fairly quickly but it's happened multiple times lately where we are missing something we have to wait for our waitress to walk by and catch their attention. Definitely still going to continue coming here!!

P.S. Does anyone know why Brad's wife got fired?????????"}
{"text":"First time visiting Cracker Barrel. It was soo good. YUM!! Can't wait until we have them in California."}
{"text":"I am from California and went to eat here yesterday. I LOVE IT! I had chicken and dumplings and meatloaf! Both were amazing! I wish we had one in California!"}
{"text":"6 ladies went for breakfast on 3-10. We go to different places every 2nd sat. Each sat. a different lady chooses. This time it was CB.  I have been there several times and have been happy with it all. However this time we waited for our server, when we ordered we waited over 20 min. for our food. It was cooked perfectly but it was COLD. Decided since it took so long not to send back. Others came and went we waited so the decision not to return it..  No one ate it all and when we paid and mentioned it got\" 
\" Oh sorry\"
I sent an e-mail to head quarters about the whole thing and all I have gotten was \"Thank you for contacting guest services\".  That was it. Did not even address the issue. No further follow up. So it is safe to say no return for us."}
{"text":"Waffle House next door messed up my hash browns last night so I came to Cracker Barrel tonight instead. Sunday 7pm and I was seated right away. I got the Sunday special and was surprised at how much food it was! It came out pretty fast, my drink was refilled frequently. I only ate half the plate and was full and took the rest to go. Picked up some some coconut candies and sixlets on the way out. Full and happy :)"}
{"text":"One star because I have to, otherwise this place would have negative stars! I have eaten at other Cracker Barrel locations an loved it, NOT here. After a very long wait and a really rude hostess we received awful food. My sausages were hockey pucks requiring a knife to cut them, my hash browns looked like I got the last bit out of the old pan, hard and overcooked (actually burnt across the top), and the biscuits were doughy and undercooked. Everyone raves that the portion sizes are huge, but it looked like they had used an oversize plate to serve me my two tablespoons of hash browns and my eggs. It took me another 15 minutes to get the rest of my breakfast! Service was lackluster and when we said something the server just put our check on the table and walked away. I will NEVER go back to this location, I'd rather drive an hour and get better food and service! Typical \"Vegasizing\" of an otherwise amazing establishment!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and along with the great food we had the best served Kathy! She was nice and funny and everything anyone should want in a server. Will definitely be making sure to ask for her next time!"}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food was definitely lackluster. However, the apple strudel dessert was fantastic. Next time
we will just go for the dessert!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is a staple in household. We go there almost every Sunday after church. They are always so kind and efficient even when they are slammed. Their food is so delicious I could eat a dozen biscuits all to myself! I usually get the Mama's pancake breakfast. But I also love their country veg plate with all the yummy sides. Their service is excellent. Ask for the apple butter! It will change your life. Never eat a biscuit without it!"}
{"text":"After hot yoga today Where I proceeded to give up half way and fall asleep. All I could think about was steak, eggs potatos and chocolate chip pancakes. It was either here or dennys AND LUCKILY I CHOSE HERE WHERE THE FOOD IS MADE IN BUTTER AND THEN TOSSED IN EXTRA BUTTER. 

My entire meal felt like a bite of heroin. I'm literally drooling trying not to eat my left overs right now (saving them for tomorrow). 

It was so good I literally felt so happy after. I will def be coming back for some good guilty pleasure food."}
{"text":"Meh, we usually like the Cracker Barrel.  We went at 2:30 on a Monday.  It was not busy.  Our server started great but then forgot us.  I ordered the chicken fried steak.  It was severed cold and bloody in the middle.  The sever return took the bloody meat back and apologized.  When he returned with another steak he stated, \"If this one isn't good enough then I don't know what to do.\"  The rest of the meal was find.  The server presented our check and then looked put out when we asked for a desert."}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place since we don't have one back at home. We came here around 9AM the parking lot was full but there was no wait to be seated. The staff were friendly and great and the food came out in a reasonable manner. Our server was friendly but didn't follow up on refills or bring us the famous apple butter they have. We ordered both from the breakfast menu, chicken with biscuits & a double meat platter. the double meat platter sausages were small and it just made me think it was a child's plate. The chicken and biscuits were good especially the biscuits. The food here is okay I guess my expectations were a bit high but will be coming back to try the desserts and perhaps the lunch/dinner food. overall we had a good experience and will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is just so cozy reminds you of an old southern country home! I enjoyed the food but it wasn't the best food I have eaten. Like another yelper stated, \"this isn't the best place for southern comfort food but it does offer an experience. Very nostalgic. Nice patriotic décor\" 

We went for breakfast. We had no complaints about service, or our meals. The prices were very reasonable in comparison to the quality and portions. 

What was 5 stars was the dessert. OMG, baked in a dish with ice cream on top, to die for. I think next time I will skip breakfast and go right for that apple baked with ice cream on top heaven! For $3.99 I received the most delicious apple baked dessert ever! I will never forget that dessert and my hips will wear it for the next month without shame because it tasted that good!"}
{"text":"This isnt the best place for Southern comfort food but it does offer an experience. Very nostalgic. Nice patriotic decor. 

The food was alright. Got the fried chicken dinner and thought it was on the dry side. Can't really go wrong with a baked sweet potato. Cheese grits, ok. My cousins country fried steak looked a lil burnt. Dessert was pretty scrumptious. Mmm Blue Bell ice cream :)

I enjoyed the gift shop the most! Cute unique things here. You can buy anything from jams, candy, clothes, to rocking chairs and wind chimes! Very random."}
{"text":"Food is great! Chicken fried chicken is the Bomb!!!Atmosphere is phenomenal. Store is super cute! Service needs a lot of work. Frankie was t our server but took care of us! He gets 10 stars in my book!!!"}
{"text":"Yessssssssssss! So we (husband and I) originally tried this place in Illinois on a trip 2 Years ago. And we LOVED IT!!!!!! Not jus the memories we had there but the FOOD WAS BOMB!!!! 

As were coming back home getting off of the freeway 3 days back from our trip we see this big sign waving saying open now. We looked dead at each other and started cracking up laughing!!! 

It was Cracker Barrel!!!! Two nights later we took the kids and they fell in love with this place just as we did. 


The food is fresh, huge, filling and just amazingly great for the prices that they have!!!!! Their apples are to die for!!!! I literally have to order 3 for myself. So intoxicating! 

We've had literally just about everything amongst us all and it was NEVER a time when we've been like (this is nasty, they dropped the ball) NEVER and we have been. Over a dozen times already to this location! 

Keep up the great work. Staff of amazing, especially with the kids. Food is delivered in a timely manner and the staff checks on your periodically. Amazing place for sure. 


Thank you all. Keep up the amazing work."}
{"text":"I really did not like this location. If you have been to other Cracker Barrels, whomever designed the inside of this restaurant really screwed up. It's really large and open with seemingly one million bright lights. It's loud and obnoxious. You feel like you're in some type of mess hall. As compared to food I've had at Cracker Barrels in the south or in St. George, Utah, this one really did not satisfy. I would rather make a special trip to St. George than drive 10 minutes to go here.

As mentioned with other reviews, the wait times are extraordinarily long. I've only eaten there once but I've stopped by three additional times. Each of those three times, the lines have been so ridiculously long and the wait time so ridiculously long that we have chosen to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was fresh, the staff was friendly and the store was too cute. This was my first time here . Unfortunately we don't have one in California just yet. You must visit this place I had the biscuits, grits, eggs and bacon. My nephew had the steak which was seasoned well and my friend had the pork chops which were quite delightful."}
{"text":"Went there for a late dinner.  I feel they have pretty good entree prices with a large variety of sides to choose from.  Now this is only my second time here and i vaguely remember the first time so i ordered the chile jack chicken, hashbrown casserole, steak fries,  and side salad for $9.79. The food was out in about 7 minutes, if that.  The chicken was decent but the chiles and cheese on top made it taste like an omelet... Very odd.  The fries were raw on the bottom of a handful of them. Hashbrown casserole looked leftover and microwaved.  The salad was ok, but very soggy and no crisp to it.  The service however  was great and she was very knowledgeable.  It was also pretty clean in there as well."}
{"text":"My family ate breakfast this morning 6/24/18 we had a party of 6 family I had pan cakes eggs and Turkey sausage"}
{"text":"This place is always a great and fun atmosphere the food is great the staff is amazing and it's always good for groups to come and talk eat and have a good time even when there is a wait they have plenty of rocking chairs outside to relax in and they have an old fashioned country store to look around in and even buy some nice things at good prices I highly reccommend this place for breakfast lunch and dinner the food pricing is great and if u haven't been here u need to come it's well worth it"}
{"text":"My first time visiting.
Delicious homemade food.. Big portions! Fluffy biscuits, 2 sides of grits, & country gravy served with your meal. Amazing food & comfy atmosphere. Steak was so thick & juicy for an $11. Meal we even took leftovers home. Peach Cobbler was SUPER yummy, hot with vanilla ice cream!! Even when we were full we got it & glad we did. 
Reasonable prices and worth the wait to be seated. Sat outside in the rocking chair! Felt like I was at grandmas house.. 
Manager Steve was very friendly with great hospitality. Checked up on us to see how our experience was.. Thanks!
Will definitely be back here"}
{"text":"I have been eating here regularly for lunch. Their Chicken \"Country House Salad\" lunch combo is a very good deal.

$5.99 for a decent sized salad with grilled chicken and mixed greens and a baked potato or soup.

Since it is summer here, I do not like to eat heavy/hot food as I work in the heat most days so this combo is very appealing."}
{"text":"YAAAAAAAAAAAS, MAMA!
I LOVE this place! We were staying in Glendale for spring training and were looking for a breakfast spot on the way to Camelback Ranch. I found Cracker Barrel on Yelp and though it only has 3.5 stars we decided to go cuz it looks like some good ol' hometown cooking. I ordered the blueberry pancake breakfast and it was TO. DIE. FOR.
The pancakes were perfectly crispy on the edges and soft in the middle. The blueberries and blueberry syrup only added to its perfection. I got the regular hash browns and I absolutely loved the way they were cooked. A lot of places seem to just sear the top of the hash browns which leave the middle shreds of potato almost raw in the middle. The hash browns here seemed to be cooked perfectly throughout. It was a great big filling breakfast which kept me satisfied for much of the day!
We loved this place so much that we came for breakfast a second day in a row. This time I got the french toast meal with the hash brown casserole. I was hesitant about this because the french toast is made with sourdough and though I love me some damn sourdough and I love me some damn french toast, I'm not sure how they'd taste together. Let me tell you. AMAZING. You don't taste the sour at all but because sourdough is a little bit of a tougher bread, it was perfectly al dente in the middle of the french toast while tasting like some of the most delicious french toast I've ever had; thanks in great part to the maple syrup! My other favorite was the hash brown casserole which is smothered in cheese. Need I say more? I mean, you should have signed up after \"smothered in cheese.\"
Anyway, I love this place. I'm moving to Arizona."}
{"text":"First and foremost I love Cracker Barrel ! But this Cracker Barrel has to be my favorite ! The service is always spot on and the meals are always so good and comforting :) My favorite servers are the Cindy's ( Cynthia Ray and Cindy aka spike ) if your new to a Cracker Barrel and want to try one thing get the Hashbrown casserole"}
{"text":"I have ate at a lot of Cracker Barrels and this one definitely does not hold up to the standards I ordered sunny side up eggs and the white was runny but the yellow was solid. my wife ordered biscuits and gravy she said the gravy tasted like Elmer's Glue I was so happy when they opened one in Vegas now I'll be happy when they closed it"}
{"text":"Aww you guys are great! Food is great and service was also! Thank you for your servers knowing the menu and knowing what to recommend! Great experience w service and food!"}
{"text":"It's opening day.  Take away the long wait and the slower than normal service and the food was excellent.   Unlike other Yelpers I knew it would be packed and expected the long delays.  Not to mention it takes time to get organized.  So that aside, I had the rainbow trout and it was fantastic.  The chicken and dumplings were also amazing according to my friend.   It was dinner time so I skipped on the pancakes but will be back soon to have those. Although I may wait a while until things mellow a bit."}
{"text":"I wish I could have given more stars, but I'm going to have to agree with Alissa.  Service was pretty bad, but my rainbow trout was very good and nicely cooked.

I think this happens in every Cracker Barrel, but it feels like you get herded in and out... and then made to look at all this stuff that tends to collect dust once the novelty of it wears off.  It may just have been a Saturday evening, but the cashiers were in no rush to move the line to pay... we pretty much just waited there for a single cashier (even though there were 2 available) to ring everyone up.  Ploy to impulse buy at the register?  Maybe so.....but it did not work on me... just got me super annoyed with lack of service."}
{"text":"Not only was the food good and the prices great but our waitress Dasia was awesome she made the whole experience worth it.  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Came back to this Cracker Barrel after a long hiatus after my last one star review.  Nice to see it is STILL the worst Cracker Barrel in the country.  Service is awful, food is worse than the other ones in the area.  Please do us all a favor and close this location.  This is the very last time I will ever step foot in the Litchfield Road Location.  I would give this place zero stars if possible.  This last time, we were seated with the restaurant half full.  After 15 minutes of no one even approaching our table, two parties who were seated 5 minutes after us were served their drinks!  Still no waiter or waitress approached our table to even take our drink orders and both tables seated after us ordered their food.  Maybe it's a racism thing since I'm Asian and all the other patrons were Caucasian."}
{"text":"I don't really like this place but the wife does, so we do go there every once in awhile. We went recently for breakfast and I ordered the sourdough French Toast. I very rarely enjoy all of my food [ some is good] when I go here but this time, it was VERY GOOD. So, I'm a new believer that they do have something on the menu for me that I can order and really enjoy."}
{"text":"I am a Cracker Barrel fanatic. As busy as they were on a Saturday it only took about twenty five mins to sit us. $7.99 for a huge sampler breakfast. How could you go wrong. And the country store, don't get me started. I love everything about that store!!!!  They sell the cutest things ever"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is a good old-fashioned restaurant, near the Silverton Casino.  This location is great for families, has a wide selection of food: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Including dessert.  The wait time was no longer than 10 mins. You just check in and they call you and your party of however many when the table is ready. The staff is friendly and professional. Food is excellent, country-like taste and always consistent. Love this place, go on and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Food here is always great but, the service is not so great. Our server was young, in a hurry & not so friendly. We ordered salads as an appetizer & it took forever to get them! When we finally did, not even 5 minutes later the food runner brought out our dinners (HUGE pet peev of mine), I like to enjoy my salad first, not feel rushed.
The food runner told us the plates were very hot, yet, set one right in front of my 22 month old daughter! 
The meatloaf was phenomenal but, our server hadn't came to check on us & I just wanted some ketchup & mustard. I finally waved down the food runner & asked her for it, well, she wasn't paying much attention to what we needed because she brought me ketchup & maple syrup...nobody bothered to clear our plates that we were done with so we could have room to be comfortable, I had to get up & put the plates on another dirty table. I really think they need better guest service training & they could have many more repeat customers because the food is always good."}
{"text":"Country strong haha!  Cracker Barrel is somewhere I've wanted to try as I've seen and heard about it while I'm traveling for business.  Now that it's in Vegas (next to Silverton)  I can have it anytime.  Well today was the day.  It's a whimsical country store/restaurant with some hearty food.  I got the eggs, biscuit n gravy, grits, sausage, and hash brown casserole.  It was all delicious and heavy...just like I imagined it to be all these years.  Lots of different bfast choices and I may try some pancakes next time as they looked good.   Service was prompt and friendly.  All the food here is straightforward and will be what you expect from a country diner."}
{"text":"Our server was really good (Todd I think his name was). The food was decent but nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"We love the food! Service is great and friendly! My kids love coming here, eating some
Great southern food while playing checkers."}
{"text":"Tips for you:
Check in online (there's always a wait)
Get the blueberry pancakes (usually amazing- this time, not so much)
Request Dejunique as your server. She provided amazing service and a cheery personality in the face of the masses."}
{"text":"Food is amazing customer service is outstanding. First time here with my girlfriend really enjoyed it the environment was very clean. A lot of food for a great price. The biscuits are one of a kind and the corn bread is delicious , will come back again"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this location. The food was just awful. Like it was sad, I love this place.  and the service SUCKED! For a southern place environment, they were not nice at all. Messed up the orders and the gravy y'all the gravy tasted horrible. Crossed finger the next Cracker Barrel is better. Just sad."}
{"text":"I had the ribeye dinner and my boyfriend had the Sunday fried chicken special...I can't remember if it was the green beans that he ordered that was awful or the fries...
The decor of the place is top notch...the food is so so...and the service is straight hillbilly...it was pure comedy...like a page out of a book...when people from Cali think of the Midwest...I kind of think that they had a Cracker Barrel in mind!!!...
They have all the homemade fixins...something you'd expect when you're going over to a neighbor's house for dinner...the store that it's connected to has all sorts of knick knacks, candles, novelty items, candy, toys, clothes even...especially lots of kids clothes...they have household items galore...it's pretty pricey though considering...
You definitely have to try it to get the full experience of the Midwest...but it's not necessarily something to write home about..."}
{"text":"Don't come on Sundays! It's insane and this is the closest one to the airport so you get lots of travelers on the weekends too"}
{"text":"Ok at best! Would knock myself out to come  again. My expectations were no high and I was disappointed. Noisy, food average for chain!"}
{"text":"I think people that live in Charlotte tend to avoid going here, but it's the same as any other one you'd go to with a friendly staff on hand.  It's not uptown but not too far away by car.  Their crispy pancakes are the best!"}
{"text":"I ordered the good morning breakfast that is on the light menu.  I thought it was supposed to include sliced tomatoes.  Just after we were served  and my plate did not have any sliced tomatoes, the manager came to the table to see how things were.  I mentioned to him that I thought sliced tomatoes were to be included on the plate and he told me no that they were not but he would double check.  I never heard anything more but on the way out I wanted to check the menu to make sure I was correct..  As I was checking and explained what had happened to the hostesses the  the manager looked at the menu and saw that indeed the dish did include sliced tomatoes.  I told the hostesses that the manager had come to our table and I questioned the lack of tomatoes and he was going to check.  He stated that he had gotten too busy with another matter and did not check but that the next time we came he would make sure I received sliced tomatoes.  I told him that there may not be another time.  I have never posted a review but felt that if is the way a MANAGER took care of problem of his own doing, it's obvious that he doesn't care about his customers and has no clue about his menu."}
{"text":"one, can't believe how many cracker barrels there are in Arizona and they have waffle houses too. these two in the same location are usually reserved south of Virginia. 

two, still one of the better chains to get a great and fulfilling breakfast without breaking the bank, which all breakfast places do. while not all CB are the same cause of whose in the kitchen, this one was better than the Yuma CB, from how they cooked their pancakes to the perfect over \"easy\" eggs.

now if we can only get you in socal."}
{"text":"Literally stood waiting for 6 minutes looking two cashiers in the face as they talked to each other. All I was trying to do was place a to-go order. No other person was in line or at the register. As I turned to leave one of them said \"next in line\" Unbelievable."}
{"text":"I'm giving 5 stars for one reason: Andy the waitress. She is amazing. Always ask for her, she will go the extra mile to help you in any way she can. Really sweet and caring. She saved me money on my to-go order. She even told me that if I ever had a problem and she wasn't there, to have the staff call her at home. How amazing is that?"}
{"text":"Service was slow even though there was hardly anyone there. The food was no better than your local Denny's or IHOP (in my honest opinion I would have rather went to one of those restaurants instead of here). Will I be back? Probably only to shop in their store- their clothes and trinkets are nice.. but to eat, I would not come here again."}
{"text":"I always LOVE Cracker Barrel, their store is amazing, and their food is just lovely. Prices on food are also very good."}
{"text":"11/12/10

2.5 stars.

First meal in Charlotte, straight from CLT's Douglas Airport.  This location is my BIL's fave location.  Replete w/ Cracker Barrel's large dining room capacity, its signature shop filled w/ old-time memorabilia and wrapped candies, goat's milk lotions and car scents, and a large selection of rocking chairs for sale in the front, this Cracker Barrel does stand out as having better customer service than what I've experienced elsewhere.  (We used to visit CBs on childhood road trips, but I could probably count on one hand the number of visits I've made in the past decade or two.)

Mom and I shared the Country Boy Breakfast (well, she had the eggs, a little slice of the steak, and some of the biscuits and hash brown casserole.  I tried to enjoy the rest, but the only item I appreciated was the dish of fried apples.  While the steak was flavorful (it was actually over-seasoned- this dish haunted me all day!), I didn't enjoy its processed texture, which came across to me as a chopped steak and not a nice piece of USDA choice.  The casserole was gummy, thus inedible, and the biscuits were dry, dry, dry.  I overcame my wariness to try the fried apples (which glistened from the cornstarch that thickened the sauce) just so that I could consume a part of a dry biscuit.  Ironic, then that out of the entire entree ensemble, all I can recommend are the apples.  (I believe Mom enjoyed the eggs...)

I did get to try my BIL's French toast special, which is your traditional French toast, but w/ more cheesecake frosting and maple-syrup goodness.  I found its sweetness a little cloying in the end, but I'd take this over the disaster that was the Country Boy."}
{"text":"I listened to my sister and her friend talk about this place from Los Angeles all the way to Las Vegas. I had never heard about it until then. The best experience I have had in along time. From walking through the store, the associates are welcoming you with smiles.  Once I got to the host another warming smile.  The atmosphere  was  casual everyone is smiling saying hello every time they pass a table.  The team worked together so you never felt you had to wait for one waitress. All this I haven't even talk about the food. Yes mouth watering !!!! The biscuits just melt in your mouth with there apple butter. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch for our first time today and it won't be the last! I had the chicken and dumplings with 3 sides and my husband had the biscuits and gravy, both meals were exceptional! The sweet tea was very good, customer service was awesome and the country store had tons of cute things to offer. And the price is AMAZING for the portion sizes! Both meals with 2 sweet teas totaled $22, defiantly aren't gonna find anything that cheap on the strip"}
{"text":"This place is gross and the food is horrible. I have friends to like this place so we've come here a few times, but after what we saw the last time I'm not sure anyone I know will ever go back. I saw food dropped and put back on a plate. Also when our server serve our food her finger actually touched my companions food. Couple this with bad tasting and Very unhealthy food, I think there are a plethora of other options out there for eating choices."}
{"text":"I stopped in for breakfast following my workout on a Friday morning. My first time at a Cracker Barrel in a few decades. My workout buddy and I each ordered breakfast and were bought back to Earth upon it's arrival. We both thought the portions would be pretty large, but they were simply the norm and very comparable to a Denny's or IHOP. He asked for his bacon extra crispy and was not satisfied with what was provided and promptly requested to send it back. The server was very nice and accommodating. She simply left what was ordered and replaced it. The food was fine and actually reasonably priced. My friend made a purchase of Jones Soda that he liked and it was interesting looking around the store for items you do not normally see."}
{"text":"I love how homey this place. I had the French toast with blackberries on it. It was truly amazing. I also have to get the biscuits and gravy. You can't go wrong looking at their store. Always cute items for a decent price. This is always my go to brunch place! True comfort food"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places and best place for stocking stuffers for the kids.  I have never been here for dinner but breakfast rocks!  I usually order the bacon and eggs which has some uncle, grandpa, or distant cousin in the name...yeah who cares the grub is good.  The bacon always comes out perfectly crisp with no soggy fat on it, the eggs always perfect as ordered, the hash brown casserole is a mixture of cheese and potato that is so perfect I am pretty sure they made a pact with the devil.  I love the fresh squeezed OJ (has a little pulp cause its REAL), the coffee is always great, my wife loves the pancakes.  The service is always quick but I wish they had call ahead seating like Mimi's because this place gets so busy but even still there is never more than a 15 minutes wait (haven't been there on a holiday).  Check out the gift shop on the way out and you have been rualized!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Very friendly staff from host to the managers...love this place. Food was fresh not warm. Burgers are yummy and worth the price."}
{"text":"All I am going to say is their hash brown casserole is the best thing since sliced bread....and the sliced bread isn't bad either.  This place is pretty consistent, never eaten hear for lunch or dinner but it is a top 2-3 places for me to have breakfast.  I also love the market store in front...I always buy my stocking stuffers for the kids here every year."}
{"text":"Arrive midmorning greeted by friendly faces sat near the window greeted by a waitress and gotten drinks right away. Ordered food came really fast hot definitely worth the money we left extra for an happy. The store was a bonus a lot of knickknacks and old-school candies. We will  be back for sure"}
{"text":"Had breakfast for the first time ever at Cracker Barrel. Portions were nice, would of loved a little more flavor in my scrambled eggs but I should have asked to add maybe peppers or onions. The best part of the meal was the service!! Dani gave us great service, that we appreciated more than the meal. Thank you, Dani."}
{"text":"No allergy menu for patrons. In this day and age, that's just not acceptable. Also, every made fresh - not exactly true. The hash browns are bought from a 3rd party and frozen, so they are probably flashed with flour (celiac's nightmare). My spouse said his chicken fried steak and biscuits and gravy were bland. He did enjoy the hash brown casserole."}
{"text":"This restaurant does not have its system together. Besides the fact that they crammed as many tables as physically possible into the dinning room, I felt like I was having dinner with the family at the adjacent table. The service was subpar and does not compare in anyway to the Cracker Barrel I know and love in St. George Utah. The food was cold and they gave us the wrong order. The waitress was sweaty and not nice. Terrible experience over all. I hope they get their sh*t together....even though the manager handled it well it should never get to that point."}
{"text":"Got off the plane, got a car and went straight here for breakfast at 7:30 AM. No problem getting a seat at this hour. Service was right on top of it. Orders were placed  and food was served pretty quick.  Tried the breakfast sampler plate with eggs, hash browns, grits, caramelized apples, bacon, sausage, ham, biscuit, gravy. All was very good and tasted great. Service was good throughout.  Prices can't be beat. Will repeat."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the half chicken Campfire Meal this evening. The chicken was tender and succulent basted with a mild, flavorful bbq sauce. Corn on the cob and coleslaw were included. Homemade tasty baked beans were delicious.  The Campfire Meals are for a limited time, July 15th. The Campfire Meals are highly recommended. We got the dinners to go. Everything was packaged well."}
{"text":"The pancakes are tasty, chicken & dumplings with the brussell sprouts/kale mix were good. Slow service from the kitchen as we had to wait about 30 minutes for our food. I understand Sundays are busy, but the service has to get better. Waitress was nice and prompt."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the visit to the restaurant. They are casual and children friendly. The meals are like at Grandma's house, loosen your belt buckle or split with a friend. Decorations are signs from 1920s. Overall very nice, Sunday mornings are BUSY, be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Very good today except waitress should have said the plate was hot to my wife. 
 Sad thing about Cracker Barrel in general is all restaurants have recently added military discounts Cracker Barrel does not. Sure they have a police discount or law enforcement .
 All restaurant and stores are fast to say Thank You to the military and veterans but just as quick to say nope no military discount. 
 I'll take Golden Coral anyway to this place for that alone."}
{"text":"We came here on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't very crowded. The waiter seemed somewhat new (all the waiters had stars on their aprons, and ours had none) but despite a minor unfamiliarity of the menu, was very friendly. I wouldn't expect too much more from a veteran four star waiter.

Despite it being 9:00 PM, I ordered off the breakfast menu and got the Big Boy Breakfast platter (or something with a similar name). For less than $10 I got a good sized steak, three eggs, grits, hashbrowns,  biscuits with gravy, and apples. It was enough food to feed the entire table. The eggs were a bit watery (possibly to make the portions bigger) but the steak was good.

My father (the account holder) had nothing but good things to say about his BLT and the fries that came with it. 

My mother got the eggs in a basket. She wasn't impressed. Her biggest grievance was the temperature of the restaurant. Although I was dressed in jeans and a hoodie and had no problems with temperature.

Overall it was a decent experience. Considering that everywhere else in the area was either fast food or looked like the scene of a horror film (I am talking to you, Miguel's Restaurants) there really wasn't much of a choice."}
{"text":"Personally I love this restaurant. I brought one of my friends who decided to order a healthy option and he was really disappointed with the portion sizes and taste.  If you are coming here order off the menu and be prepared for a little extra calories but a lot of extra taste."}
{"text":"Just your average chain restaurant serving up southern style food. I always get the same thing whenever I go? The country boy breakfast. Maybe the cook was new but he cut up my steak in all places either to cook it through faster or he didn't know what medium rare was. Regardless, my steak was still moo'ing. They never gave us the jam but our service was average. Our waitress was nice and the man that delivered our food was too. My daughter enjoyed her chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"I used to go to Cracker Barrel restaurants on the east coast all the time but have not been impressed at this new location in Las Vegas. The nice thing about these restaurants is how quiet and \"grandmas kitchen\" the atmosphere is, even if they are fairly busy. Well this location is always so absolutely PACKED with rude city people the atmosphere absolutely ruins it. We went once a few months after it opened and heard nothing but screaming kids, people shouting to talk over each other, servers who were RUNNING and miserable like your average denny's or ihop during sunday breakfast. It lost the atmosphere needed for the type of restaurant it was designed to be. Cracker Barrel was not designed for a city like Las Vegas. 

The final straw that broke the camel's back is we attempted to go recently and give it one more shot only to learn that after how many decades they have REMOVED the only turkey sandwich they ever had from their menu. That is right people....a generic American chain restaurant no longer serves a turkey or club sandwich. I was absolutely floored at this. Meanwhile they have THREE different versions of fried chicken sandwiches (gross!). I was shocked and promptly left since both myself and the person I dine with are very very picky eaters and it is the ONLY thing we ever ate from their menu. Can anyone name a generic chain, low end American restaurant that doesn't have some sort of turkey/club sandwich? Dennys....IHop.....Friendlys....99.....Uno's.....? No? Didn't think so. 

Do not EVER expect corporate to give you a response either. When I called the restaurant here back I was on hold forever, got transferred to someone \"who can help\" who simply told me that item is discontinued, no idea why, you need to call cop orate. Click. If you dine at these places and have an issue you are SOL because you will NOT receive a response or resolution. I e-mailed corporate inquiring with very specific questions and NONE were answered. Why did they remove the only turkey sandwich from their menu? Did this item not sell? Are you replacing it with another similar item or any version of a turkey sandwich? The response I received was the immediate computer generated thank you someone with respond within a couple days. So yes, a few days later I received a message that was an absolute joke with a simple non-informative statement.....\"thank you for your comments. We will forward them on to our marketing team. Please contact us if we can assist you with anything else.\" That is right folks, no answer to an English language QUESTION, not even a personalized response. I am beyond furious at their lack of communication. All I wanted was an answer, even if I did not like the answer. It tells you they don't give a flying you know what about their customers. 

I will NEVER be dining here again, have thoroughly advised anyone around town who has asked me about the restaurant to avoid it and will leave this for anyone curious about dining here."}
{"text":"Incredible service! A few things went wrong here and there but they went above and beyond to fix their mistakes. Very impressed. It's only been open a month but they are on top of things once an error is brought to their attention. 

Also, incredible food. Obviously. It's Cracker Barrel. 

In regard to the low ratings because of the wait, y'all obviously have never been to a Cracker Barrel before. There is ALWAYS a wait during normal meal times, no mater the Cracker Barrel, no matter the state. Expect 45-90 minutes on average depending on the party size. There's a reason there's always a wait; they're worth it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place considering there was so much hype before this restaurant even opened. 

Came here on a Thursday morning and there was a 25 minute wait...okay no big deal. We were seated and ordered our food. 

Finally got our food after waiting 45 minutes and this was probably the worse breakfast I've ever ate. We ordered the sunrise sampler and French toast. Were the eggs even real eggs? They tasted like powdered eggs. Bacon had no taste and the ham didn't look appetizing so I gave it to my husband. He tried a little piece of it and said the ham had an odd smell. The only thing that had flavor was the cheesy hash browns. 

I honestly thought that it was impossible to mess up breakfast food but this place takes the award for that. Service was poor as well, we ordered a blueberry muffin and a water with lemon and the server didn't bring either of those items. Other than childhood memories I really don't understand why people are so attached to this place."}
{"text":"Stopped their for some dinner on the way home. We ordered and waited for our food to come. On two occasions the waitress came by and said \"Your next\" about 10 minutes apart. After about a half hour of waiting the manager came by and said the printer didn't print our order and said she would comp dessert for us. Essentially the waitress lied and didn't have a clue where our order was. Really. You make me wait almost 40 minutes and you want to comp me a $3.49 dessert?  They didn't even offer us both one.  If it had been late we have just left. Then when it did come the eggs were cooked wrong. Any other place would have comped the meal or offered a free one. Worst handling of bungled order ever. We will never visit a Crackle barrel again."}
{"text":"I like it! I mean, it's a chain restaurant so it can only reach a certain level of deliciousness, hence no five stars. But the service and cleanliness really was superb. Actually our waitress was so nice and giving us menu help for the most food at the lowest cost. I wish I remembered her name, she was so kind!"}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars for friendliness, prompt service and reasonable prices for large portions. Plus the coffee is pretty good, too. Their breakfast choices are plentiful and the sides can include biscuits and gravy, baked apples, hashbrown casserole and more. The pancakes are huge and come with plenty butta and warm individual bottles of maple syrup. The sour dough French toast is also a great pick. Eggs any way, healthy options if needed,  massive combos and more. Plus an incredible gift shop with yummy treats for all, baking supplies and just plain unique items for any household. Come on by and stay awhile- the kind folks here aim to please!"}
{"text":"I've been to many across the country and really like this place NORMALLY.   I was so excited they finally opened in Vegas and have been wanting to go so bad.

I decided to come here last night with my daughter and son in law.  The menu is interesting, it's not what you would expect from a place like this.  It was limited, meaning they do not offer a lot of sandwich choices, their main dishes are varied and the food was just ok, nothing special and nothing like the other locations I'd been to in the past.  It was actually very bland and not tasty at all.

I've always liked their breakfast, will have to see their lunch menu, but the dinner menu, I was not impressed with and probably would not go back to this location for dinner unless there is an invitation I just can't pass up...meaning I would go for the company not the food.

This place does not believe in consistency at all.  My daughter and I both decided to order the same dish a combo sampler.  Meatloaf, chicken & dumplings, ham with your choice of 3 sides.  Once my son in law arrived, he decided to order the same thing.  When my daughters and mine came out it was like WHAT???  Two identical plates with two different portions???  One plate had a huge piece of meatloaf, one was a sliver and same thing with the other two items.  Two identical plates with two different portions.  When my son in laws arrived, different from the other two???  No sauce or gravy on the meatloaf, one small piece of chicken hidden under a lot of dumplings and gravy, the smallest sliver of ham not even worthy of a taste.

I even mentioned it to our server who just looked at the plate and chuckled??  Don't get me wrong she was an awesome server but really did not know what to say.  I don't think she knew what to do and just walked away.

I'll give this place a chance for lunch one day maybe, but as for this location, they are not consistent in plating and I will not go back for dinner again.  The food was bland and really not that impressive.  First time ever I heard my son in law not like his food either."}

{"text":"Our group of 3 stopped here at 8am on a Tuesday morning.  Wonderful breakfast menu for reasonable prices.  The food took a long time to be served but our server kept our drinks topped up at all times while we waited and played the table peg game.  When the food did eventually come (about 45 minutes after ordering) most of it was great although one dish had badly burned pancakes."}
{"text":"I enjoy eating here the staff is great food is good except the chicken and dumplings never order that again I don't know what they are thinking but that's not it but everything else is great. Waiting staff is great the store is super and a really great young lady on Friday working there that I in joy seeing when I come in she is always friendly and helpful I hope they never loss her or the rest of the staff for they have a great team there and they should be paid more for what they do!! I have been to other stores/restaurants and they can't hold a candle to this one   Just they need more room for POEPLE getting in and out and waiting to be seated other then that its find"}
{"text":"We came for a late lunch.  I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before, but I've always heard good things about the chain.

The hostess wasn't rude, but it was plain to see that she didn't want to be there.
The server was pleasant & attentive.

I will only speak for my own meal.

I ordered the chicken & dumplings ($7.99 w/2 sides) and I chose cornbread instead of biscuits.
The food came out to us at a reasonable time.

The chicken & dumplings were room temp.  They were as bland as hospital food.

Coleslaw (side) - I was happy that it was the same kind of slaw that most restaurants serve.  It was good, but there's no way I'd believe it was made fresh there.

seasonal fruit cup (side) - the cup was small enough to hold one golf ball.  There were 3 chunks of fresh pineapple and 2 halves of a strawberry.  If it hadn't been included, it's a $3 side.


Finally, the corn bread.  Greasy on the outside and sawdust on the inside.  I attempted to spread butter on a piece, but was left with a glob of butter coated with crumbs.  I did bite the top half w/out butter and quickly spat it into a napkin.  No exaggeration, either the mix they used was long since expired or whoever mixed it was a smoker.

I will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"Day after Thanksgiving. Had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table to seat 5, had plenty of time to shop their store. This restaurant near Charlotte Speedway. Took a while to get order, food pretty good."}
{"text":"I really like CB for a good breakfast meal. I still think the Original Pancake House trumps them...They are in a league of their own but the CB does provide good quality and breakfast for a excellent price. You can feed a family of 5 and everyone be full for a great price. 

Being someone who doesn't  eat pork and this being a breakfast country restaurant, I am very pleased that they have turkey products like bacon and sausage. The menu is very large as they have  two, one for breakfast and the other for lunch/dinner. 
Service has always been good when I've dined there and the staff has good knowledge of the menu. 

I reserve 4 and 5 stars for upscale and gourmet restaurants but is give the CB a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited that this location opened since it's super close to my work and I'd never been to a Cracker Barrel before. A few coworkers and I came in for lunch with only a 15-20 min wait before we got seated. I love that they have a little gift shop to browse around in while waiting for a table.

Food wise I had the lunch special of a country salad with grilled chicken and calm chowder soup. The salad was pretty standard, but a good overall taste. The soup was good also and you can't beat a price of $5.99 for both. 

I'd definitely come back again. It's a nice little spot for some classic southern/American food at very realizable prices."}
{"text":"We stopped by this Cracker Barrel while on a vacation road trip. Pretty much the same exact Cracker Barrel experience as every one we have been too. Very good quality control by the company. I recommend the pancakes, biscuits, sausage, fried chicken, chicken and dumplings, and the fried apples. Pretty much everything is good. Do not eat this type of food regularly or you will become obese."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally try this place after ive heard such good things about it, well the excitement was very short lived. First it took 45 minutes to get our food (2 people), the food was cold and had absolutely no flavor. The service was terrible i drank my drink right away and waited the entire time for a refill, which wasnt offered until she brought us the bill. Then i had to struggle to the register because the layout of this place is ridiculous and when i get to the front finally the person who should be waiting on me decides that sending a very long text is more important than my time, and by this time im dieing to get out of this noisy, cluttered, overrated, overpriced, dump they decided to call a restaurant. Truely a terrible experience im shocked this place has made it."}
{"text":"Always love Cracker Barrel. Great breakfast served all day."}
{"text":"A chain restaurant for sure. The corn bread and biscuits were average. I had the bacon cheese burger, it too was average. The service was average and the prices were fair. It was very busy and I don't understand why so many people like this place."}
{"text":"We were a party of four: the hubby, my daughter, her friend, and me.

I was almost dragged in by my hubby, who has been babbling about their pancakes every day since the latest advert began running.

While I've eaten at Cracker Barrel in the past, it's not exactly on my top 10 list of places to grab a bite.

My main gripe is the seating. I do NOT like wooden chairs, the tables are small and crowded with unnecessary...stuff. The restaurant itself reminds me of a kitchen from the 18th or 19th century. But I find the store amusing.

Our waitress was great. She came over right away to take our drink order and returned with them promptly. Our food arrived hot and ready to eat. She gave us extra napkins before we asked for them, offered drink refills at the right moments, etc.

My daughter and her friend shared a starch-fest of mac 'n cheese, chicken and dumplings, fries, biscuits, and baked apples. 

The hubby got his much-desired pancakes (with sausage patties and scrambled eggs). He practically drooled his way through his meal.

I had french toast with scrambled eggs and bacon. 

Great that there were four pieces of french toast but the powdered sugar I love on french toast was absent. My eggs were scrambled hard, the way I like them but one more egg for all that french toast (or one less piece of french toast) would have been better. My bacon was just right: no visible fat, crisp, and just salty enough. I would have gotten a bacon sandwich to go but I didn't think my LDL needed any more trouble.

I also had a cup of coffee. Nothing special but it was hot.

Hubby said the total was $31. Not a bad price for all we ordered and our service was good too. 

Four stars for all of the above but at the end of the day, I'd still rather eat someplace else."}
{"text":"I'll make this short and sweet.

I LOVE CRACKER BARREL.

Food is always delicious and service is super fast and always great."}
{"text":"I love me some Cracker Barrel! I haven't mastered the art of cooking a good meatloaf, so when I have the craving I look for a Cracker Barrell. I'm so glad they opened this location, because I had to drive all the way up to Concord Mills exit to get my fix before. 

The service hasn't really improved since the opening week. For some reason there is always a problem getting my drink here. I think I throw the server off when I order my food and drink at the same time? Last time the server came back to ask if we wanted some bread while we waited for food, and I responded with \"well, not really, but I would LOVE to have my water while I wait\". LOL! He apologized and ran with some great speed to grab our water. 

There does seem to be a good 30 minute wait between ordering and getting my food no matter what I order. Hopefully that will eventually speed up soon. 

The parking lot always seems to be full and often there is a wait. The turn around on tables seems to be pretty speedy though, so that is good. Haven't had to wait more than 20 mins to be seated yet, even when I was told the wait would be 45 minutes. 

This is actually the second CB I've seen not directly off the Interstate. We had one back in Athens, GA.. which has no interstate nearby.. good 30 minute drive to I-85. These non-interstate CB's must be popping' up due to high demand, which seems to be the case here.. 

I gave 4 stars.. but it's more like 3.5. I'll return often for my meatloaf cravings! yay!"}
{"text":"Short & sweet...the campfire meals are awesome!  Hubby got the pot roast dinner and I had the BBQ beef brisket breakfast.  We ate every last bite of both our meals...delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Visited Arizona over the weekend and of course, had to eat at one of my favs. I was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Whenever I am in Buckeye Az visiting my brother and his family, I have to make a stop here. 

It is absolutely cute and cozy! Their food is country style and have all the fixings you will just enjoy! I usually get their  lower calorie breakfast-yogurt parfait with scrambled eggs & turkey bacon. Their pancakes are light and fluffy and are tasty. All items on their menu are reasonably priced. And always their waitstaff are so friendly and sweet. 

After my meal I always shop in their general store. They have really cute gift items such as glassware, candy, tea, clothing, etc. 

I just wish they had one in my area but it is a nice treat for us when out of town!"}
{"text":"It is smaller than other Cracker Barrel restaurants I have visited. Wait was long, but, food was worth the wait, as expected"}
{"text":"OKAY, So I wish I could write two separate reviews on this place, but I'll just include both experiences here. 

The very first time I went Cracker Barrel - amazing experience. The food was good, great portions, cheap prices, and the FOOD itself was satisfying. And to top in all off, we had GREAT service. Our server was extra attentive to our party of 4 (whom are very needy and specific about what they want). The server was very patient and fulfilled our needs. So, after this experience, we were sure that it was worth coming back to. First time visit: 4 stars

After that, I went two more times. The second time, it was not too special, I ordered the chicken tenders. The food did not \"taste bad\", it was just bland. The third time I went, I felt that the food got worse. It was bland, the mashed potatoes had no seasoning, the mac and cheese were too mushy, but the chicken was good. I even ordered the same entree I did on my first experience because I like it so much, but obviously, there seems to be some consistency issues. This experience, I would give it a 1 star, so that's why I just averaged the score to three stars.

For both times, I did NOT like to cornbread. It's dry, crumbly, and had no flavor; the biscuits are better, but taste store-bought anyway.

However, both times, I really like the coleslaw, so that's a plus, because I am very picky with coleslaw. This is my favorite place so far when it comes to coleslaw.

As for the service, can't say anything bad about it, they do an exceptional job.
I particularly like the little store on the side, too. It carries a lot of candy and pop that bring back memories of my childhood, with very cheap prices as well.

From this review, I would hope to either improve the food, or better, yet, add some consistency, because I may come back another time, and it be fantastic again, but not sure when that day will be? Does it just depend on the cook? Perhaps. But I don't want to visit on a gamble that it MIGHT be good this time around."}
{"text":"Decided to check out this Cracker Barrel because we were on this side of town after an event. I have had good experiences at their Craig location so I was excited because we were hungry! There wasn't a wait which was good because I was anticipating one it being a Saturday evening and all. No appetizers this time but we ordered the Signature Burger ($8.99), the Country Fried Steak ($12.4)9, the Meatloaf (10.99), and the Country Fried Shrimp for me ($11.49). 

    While we waited for our food our very nice waitress brought us out some biscuits and corn bread muffins. The corn bread was delicious but we had to bring it to the managers attention (he happened to be walking by and asked us), that the biscuits were very underdone. So much so that the center was gooey. He replaced them with new ones and they were fine.

    My friend, as a one of his sides, ordered a side salad so that came out first. More than a couple pieces of the lettuce were dark and beginning to rot. Then we received our dinners to which I grabbed the dish the butter had come in for the biscuits and muffins to scoop out my side of macaroni and cheese to give to my boyfriend- hey, I'm nice. I then went to eat some of my mashed potatoes and I found a black hair. It was right under the mashed potatoes on the side so it could have been from the macaroni or the potatoes. We brought it the managers attention and he replaced my meal and took the meal off the bill. Which was nice because I wasn't asking for that. But at this point I lost my appetite and had to take the food to go. Which was so unfortunate because it's seafood so it never tastes the same as it does fresh.

    I asked everyone else how their meals were and I got the following feedback
-The burger was fine, it was just generic and the fries were bland.
-The country fried steak was good and it had a nice crunch.
-The meatloaf was bland and not very good.

    Overall, our waitress and the manager were great. The kitchen I would say at this location is seriously lacking. Rotting lettuce, hair in the food and bland meals isn't going to have me return to this location. I'll stick to the one on my side of town."}
{"text":"Second time visiting a Cracker Barrel, the first time was in Florida, years ago, and it was pretty much the same. Big retail area with a lot of fun things to discover, although pricey at times. 

My friend and I stopped here for lunch and we didn't leave hungry! The prices are great for the portions you get. You get your meal plus THREE sides and biscuits or corn muffins. My friend ordered their fried catfish with hushpuppies, two sides of their macaroni and cheese, okra and biscuits. I order their fried shrimp with hushpuppies, macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes with white gravy, okra and corn muffins. 
 
The fried shrimp and hushpuppies was delicious.Their mashed potatoes were great and their macaroni and cheese was to die for (real, BAKED, fresh mac n cheese). I tried my friends catfish and it also was delicious, very fresh! The only thing I wasn't crazy about was their okra, I've had better (and it didn't come out with my meal, I had to ask for them to bring it out because it was forgotten). Their biscuits I could live without, but the corn muffins were yummy. Our waitress Alejandra was a sweetheart and made us feel very welcome, we'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We go to cracker barrel quite often but this was the first time at this location. Service was friendly, table was clean, restroom clean... Love love the store. However when it came to the food... Honestly wasn't impressed at all. I ordered the mama's French toast scrambled eggs and bacon. Bacon was crispy, eggs were well eggs.. My food was warm at best, now the French toast I honestly ate 2 bites and left the rest, they were completely disgusting, tasted like bricks of butter, they were very dense, flavorless other than butter. My son had eggs sausage and biscuits and gravy and my son said here mom have a biscuit, again all it tasted like was a brick of butter, I don't like to give my son an opinion of something he is eating so he can decide for himself if he likes it or not so I did not let him know I found them awful and he himself said these are gross, and left them. Keep in mind We've been to cracker barrel numerous times and love the food, what happened here Idk but I will not come back to this location, and it'll be awhile before I go back to cracker barrel at all. Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star for friendly people in the front. 1 star for the never ending sweet tea I like the biscuits the corn bread  they can keep that... over all the food is good . My only regret is the server we got he was slow.  Other servers were very quick and sweet with their tables and we got nice nasty with a mustache....  
so the take
Chicken fried steak 4 stars
Mashed potatoes 3 stars
Mustard greens 4 stars 
Black berry cobbler 2 stars ( wasn't sweet like my granny's)

The food is good"}
{"text":"Called early today, thanksgiving day. Trying to help a family who is less fortunate eat tonight. I needed three Thanksgiving meals. When I first called the lady said \"I have several people in front of me Sir\" and hung up. I called back got the same lady and asked for the manager. I recd the same vibe from the manager. \"Sir I can't guarantee anything we are very busy\" I simply asked him if there is no food available please tell me and I will make other arrangements. The manager replied with \"great sir, thank you, have a great day\". He was ending the Conversation. I abruptly said \"so Cracker Barrel does not have food available today?\" \" what if I just put in an order for three adults?\" he said OK sir we can do that. I told him to have it ready by 430 which he agreed. We decided the family needed a pie. I called an hour later and Jeff set me at ease. Took my order, asked what sides we want, even gave me a total of the bill. We shall see what happens."}
{"text":"Why oh why don't they have a Cracker Barrel in Califonia??!!  My friends and I were in the Phoenix area this weekend and this was first on our list to eat!  We were excited to eat our breakfast here!  We also love browsing through the country store and sitting outside in the rocking chairs.  I hope one day this chain will expand to the Pacific Coast."}
{"text":"This is what you would expect a tradition of Cracker Barrel they food is good the staff is always friendly and stores fun to visit"}
{"text":"I've  reviewed another Cracker Barrel in the past, and this location lives up to the all-american constant that I've come to expect from Cracker Barrels.
Its a tradition for my sister and I to have a meal at Cracker Barrel when I come to visit her, so we headed straight over there when I got off the train yesterday morning. I was pleasantly surprised to be seated without a wait- it was about 10:45 in the morning and the parking lot was PACKED (post-church crowd?).  But we must have come in at the perfect time because there was one empty, clean table- and it was ours!
Our server was very nice, our food came out quickly and tasted great. You know how sometimes when food comes out really fast it tastes old like they made it earlier and waited for someone to order it? This wasn't the case. It was all piping hot and fresh. The odds were ever in our favor."}
{"text":"I like Cracker Barrel. Well...at least this one. I've never been to any other location. 

No, the food isn't great (at least the lunch/dinner options), but it's not bad. It's been awhile since I've been here for breakfast, but if I recall that stuff is actually quite good (and cheap).

My dad freakin' LOVES this place. We came here for his birthday dinner recently so that's what I'm basing this review on. I got fried chicken and it came with two sides. The fried chicken was actually quite good. It was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and nice & hot. Cracker Barrel gives you several different side options w/there meals (like, around 10). I had the hash brown casserole thingy, which is also a side they serve with breakfast meals. It's yummy! Basically, it's cheesy hash browns. I also got turnip greens. They were OK, but not great. They were kind of watery & lukewarm. I get the impression most of the sides at Cracker Barrel are cooked well in advance and just sit around most of the day. I also think turnip greens are most likely an unpopular side, and therefore probably sit around longer, without a fresh batch getting made.  I also had some lemonade to drink. It's basically liquid diabetes, which also means it's delicious! 

This place is ALWAYS packed (on the weekends anyway). This was the first time I've been here since moving back to AZ in June, but it's not for lack of trying. I've tried to stop in w/my parents a few times over the past few months, but the wait was ridiculous (this past time we waited 20 minutes for a table, which really wasn't all that bad). Cracker Barrel has a gift shop set up as you wait where they sell overpriced country/southern novelties.

Service was fine & the food here is VERY affordable. I probably wouldn't choose this place, but I don't mind coming here at all w/my dad who like I said, LOVES this place."}
{"text":"It's always good, reliable country food seasoned well. Interesting interior and a great in-house store."}
{"text":"This place is cheap, has a huge selection and the wait staff are really friendly.

Loved that they have a handful of healthy options as sides and main dishes to choose from.

I enjoyed the baked \"fried\" chicken with steamed veggies and a side salad.

I did indulge in a biscuit which melted in my mouth it was soooooooooooo good. They give those out for free so be careful. =)

The country store when you enter is really fun to peruse around in while you have to wait for a table. Every restaurants should have this. What a way to make $$$ and satisfy your customers at the same time."}
{"text":"We had a party of 21 walk in today and a lot of us were first timers and ohhhh man! We were goin to go to raisin canes but a friend said no way we have to try Cracker Barrel !! Glad we did This place was so good! The food was amazing and the service was the best we have ever gotten while dining with this big a group! They took great care of us and we're fast and friendly!! Def recommend this place"}
{"text":"A chain that touts itself as serving old-style, down-home country food.  When you step onto the restaurant's \"porch\" and see a whole row of new wooden rocking chairs,\"gently used\" rockers, and a rocking chair wind chime, all laid out as if they were cars at a car dealership, they mean business with their down-home country atmosphere!  The food itself, just OK.  We went with a friend who used to be in the service industry who said that after inspecting the meals we got, most of the items here were mass-produced, and either came from a can or were previously frozen and shipped here.  I tried the breakfast combo that came with eggs, turkey sausage, grits, and hash brown casserole.  They were all decent, not exceedingly superb, but not bad.  The gravy on the biscuits was pretty bland though. As for drinks, the peach sweet tea here is nice, it's not overly sweet, and is actually made with Splenda, while the coffee, just OK, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel! I always stop at one if I'm in a town with one. I've been to them in the deep south and now the southwest. 

It was very good. Basic breakfast foods, but, great biscuits & gravy and hashbrown casserole. 

Friendly service, always there to refill your sweet tea, etc. I'd definitely pop in here again if in the area. (And, I even got a cute birdhouse in the gift shop.)"}
{"text":"So I don't usually give reviews however everyone needs to know about this place. We waited for over an hour to be seated. When we sat down we already knew what we wanted and placed order immediately. Somehow our order got lost so waited some more. Food arrived chicken sandwich was burnt with literally 5 fries and we asked for no mayo and of course mayo on it so now it's half a sandwich because the other bun was drenched in mayo. Silverware wrapped was dirty with food caked on it. Food orders sides for 3 people all mixed up on each other's plates. The chicken fried chicken barely had any gravy on it. On top of all that yes the manager comes over and apologizes and says she will be discounting the bill and for our troubles free dessert. Well she took $4.00 off the bill and for the dessert at first it was said get what you want then when ordering was told oh that dessert is for two people so they made us share one after saying each one of us would get a dessert. The worst Cracker Barrel experience ever. Would never go back. If you want an amazing Cracker Barrel experience you might rethink this place. Nashville is where I will go back. These people are giving Cracker Barrel a BAD reputation. The only reason one star is up is because you have to at least click on one star to get posted. So just so everyone knows my rating is a negative star"}
{"text":"I think I've been to a Cracker Barrel before, but it was at least 12-15 yrs ago in Az. So no memory of food or service. Everyone raves, so I took the kids. 45 minute wait on a Monday afternoon? Ok, it's Xmas week, so they get a break. Plus the place is semi-new, so maybe they're still dealing with growing pains. But there was a gigantic line that snaked thru the restaurant - and that was for the cash register!  Food was better than average, prices were better than average. Service was slightly on the slow side, but was expecting worse when I walked in. Corporate needs to look at management here. It's obvious to an amateur that they need more servers, cooks, and cashiers on duty, so obviously they're just trying to save a buck at the expense of customer's time. Overpriced junk in store. Great coffee. Waitress named Sasha was very nice and was busting her ass, but everyone else was slow. Give that kid a raise and get her some help. I'll try again for bfast, but probably the location on Craig."}
{"text":"What pulled this review out of negative territory was the excellent service, decor, and ambiance. If I could solely grade the menu items my review would be minus two. While Cracker Barrel is certainly in the hospitality business they are not in the food and restaurant business. I have dined at this location twice and both times were abject FAILS. I sampled the regular menu fare (we ordered many items off the menu) during my first visit and proclaimed it the worst meal I can recall at a 'restaurant.' My other daughter wanted to try Cracker Barrel so I reluctantly went back and this time thought I couldn't go wrong ordering off the breakfast menu. Second worst meal during a lifetime of dining and just as abominable as the first. If Wonder bread has a cousin they serve it at Cracker barrel. The toast was thin and highly processed. Like cotton candy, it starts dissolving in your mouth before you can chew. I had to send the 'French toast' back (trust me, the French want no part of this toast charade). The kitchen used the same Wonder bread wannabe and fried it in (what I can only guess) some sort of bland highly processed vegetable oil--the kind the FDA is constantly warning you about. How is it possible to ruin elementary-level French toast? The eggs were serviceable and passed muster. Our wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating, the decor delightfully retro-themed, and the background music scored major points. A perusal through the well-stocked gift shop and a leisurely recline in the comfy rocking chairs outside took the edge off of what would have been a disastrous dining experience. We stopped at a pizza place on the way home for some takeout so I could have a meal before retiring. Perhaps it is the transiency of their customers that drives the low standards of this particular Cracker Barrel. They could (and should) do so much better. 

Many have complained about the long wait. A wait is almost always worth it if the food is good. There is nothing to wait for at Cracker Barrel so it would behoove you to mosey on to one of many fine dining options in Las Vegas. 

To the chef at Cracker Barrel: how *is* it possible to ruin French toast and just about everything else on the menu?  This is simple, comfort food...not much to mess up. I do have a suggestion: jack up the prices (they are way too low) and use higher quality victuals."}
{"text":"Second time here at the Craig location. Would HIGHLY recommend to my friends and family. The food is great, service is AWESOMME!!!"}
{"text":"First time bad experience with a Cracker Barrel.  Visited about 7:00 PM on Monday, 1/2/17.  Not real busy, however; service was very slow and my wife's food was not very hot when she got it.  Must have been standing for a while.  Waitress brought the food and bill, that was it.  Did not check on us at all during our meal.  Had to ask someone else for a refill on our beverage.  The manager needs to visit the Cracker Barrel in St George, UT to see how it is done. We have eaten at the North Las Vegas location three other times and enjoyed the service and food, especially Thanksgiving 2016."}
{"text":"Best country food since my childhood and very reasonable prices to boot. Excellent service couldn't believe how fast the food came out even my grandma who raised me on this type food could learn something from the cooks here. Down home American fare."}
{"text":"J and I wanted to take my grandparents out to dinner Saturday night, as a thanks for all they have done to help us with the wedding planning. I give J the task on figuring out where to go, and he suggests Logan's or Cracker Barrel. I think, OOH there's a Famous Dave's there and Papa LOVES bbq. So, I throw that idea out there as well. But since the g-rents also like \"southern home cookin\", we went to Cracker Barrel. 

We arrive to find no host at the station and end up standing around for about 5 minutes with no one in sight. Finally, what looks like a manager, comes by and says....Someone will be with you shortly. Wow, really? Finally, the host arrives to his station, and we are escorted to a table. 

We wait for our server to come by the table. 10 minutes or so and still no server. Finally another server stops and asks us if we've been helped. J replies firmly, \"No, we have not!\" The server asks us for our drink order and comes back a few minutes later with our beverages. He says that \"our server\" was complaining about another table, or was complaining about another table complaining, so he was going to take our table. Okay, cool cause we're hungry. 

J orders the Meatloaf. I get the Chicken Fried Chicken with the gravy on the side. Grams orders the Grilled Chicken Tenders Dinner. And Papa orders the BBQ sandwich. We distract ourselves for the moment with that puzzle game while we wait for our biscuits and cornbread, which finally arrived with our meal. 

Grams dinner - She said everything tasted fine. 
Papa's dinner - His bbq sandwich was according to him (he does NOT hold back when it comes to his opinions, especially food) dry, stringy, tough, and under seasoned. I asked our server for a side of bbq sauce so he could eat. 
My dinner - The only thing decent was the Okra and the Apples. The Mac and Cheese had what looked like black plastic in it. After I got done picking it out and putting it on the side of my plate, it looked to be about 1/3 c of the black crap. I told J, \"What the hell is this!?\" 
J's dinner - The meatloaf was bone dry. The mashed potatoes and gravy were cold. Literally, the gravy was congealed. 

J was fed up, and he got up to seek out a manager. The manager came back and was combative with him. He said, the black stuff was cheese. REALLY?! Since when is cheese the consistency of melted plastic and black in color?! He offered to have our meals replaced. A few minutes later, our dinners come out. J says that it looks much better. I pick through the Mac and Cheese and find no black crap. Alright!! Let's chow! Not even 30seconds later, J's sitting there staring at his mashed potato loaded fork in front of his face. I look over and immediately start laughing. Its a HAIR! You've got to be kidding! 

The server comes by a few seconds later and says, \"How's everything...\" and stops mid sentence. He sees J staring at something on the fork. \"Oh no, that's not good\" our server says. He goes off to get the manager. I cant stop laughing. 
I cut into my chicken, and without looking take a bite. Hmmm, something was off. I look down and yeah, that's not chicken fried chicken. Its chicken fried steak, which I LOATHE. I just think tenderized meat tastes like its already been chewed. 

The manager comes by and apologizes for everything and says our dinner's are free (including my grandparents). You're Dayumn'ed right they better be free!! We do leave our server a tip, since the quality of our dinner was not in anyway his fault. 

Papa, without missing a beat says, \"Well Lorraine, you want to come back and try breakfast here tomorrow?\" Grams says, \"Yeah, I don't think so.\" 

In a nutshell, we shoulda gone to Famous Daves."}
{"text":"Love the Cracker Barrel and we don't have these in California so when in AZ it's a must have stop. Great service and great food. I always get the Breakfast Sampler and is so delicious. The biscuits are killer and the country store is where I always get little gifts for my family."}
{"text":"Lots of workers, not nearly as many customers.  SLOW service, dirty tables all around, wait staff moving very slowly, even in the kitchen area.  Then I see a very slow moving young manager and it all makes sense.  

No- this is not the Cracker Barrel of the past; there's no \"old country\" left in any of it...  it's now just another product of millineal mindsets resulting in a less that memorable customer experience...  but hey- what do they care, they've already got your money by the time you realize the problem."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to relax about the wait times. They've been open a hot minute and there's a lot of hype,  news coverage etc.  I was there the 1st day. Waited a long time to be seated, got my food within 25 minutes of ordering.  It was all delicious. I'm so excited to finally have access to country ham, cheesy hashbrowns, and fried apples, all the time.  The hype and wait times will calm down,  in the meantime enjoy the wonderful Cracker Barrel experience. I know I will.  I'm going back this weekend, for sure."}
{"text":"We go to locations all over the country when we travel. Went to the Las Vegas location during the week about lunch time to have breakfast. Ambiance is fun and always enjoyable especially the cute Cracker Barrel gift shops. Restaurant was busy and loud but still had a nice time. Server was very friendly. Food is okay, its not the best food and not the worst. I normally order breakfast no matter what time of day it is. Bacon and hashbrowns are good. Biscuits, gravy, pancakes, and eggs are also tasty."}
{"text":"Awsome price for great food most items under 10$!!! will be going back to try the breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"It was OK, I was surprised to know none of the gravy was chicken based so that took grandpa style out of options. I tried mom's French toast with turkey sausage and eggs. It was my first time with turkey sausage which was good but French toast was not good no berries on top and when I got berries on side they were too old. My beau tried mom's pancakes with pecans, pancakes were good they ran out of turkey bacon so he went with bacon which was bummer. Food was ok not great."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my husband.  It was really good.  Everything came out hot fresh and super fast.  They were ready for us.  

I usually go for my usual either the fried shrimp dinner or old timer's big breakfast, but tonight I wanted to try something new.  Their chicken dumplings looked really good.  They came out pretty good.  Very southern home cooking and hearty.  

Our waitress, Sheryl, did a great job of taking care of us.  She was always around and very helpful.  

We were so full, we took a lot of food home, BUT we had to have desert.  We tried their new pineapple upside down cake.  Very rich, but sweet and yummy.  It really hit the spot topped with ice cream.  You get a really large piece too."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service. Have been a regular customer of cracker barrel all over the country for decades now. I think it's safe to say that the experience here was one of best I've ever had considering the challenges of an opening day. 

Yes the lines are very long. Roughly 2 hour wait for a party of four but they quickly moved through the waiting list and kept us informed of our position. Browsing the store is always a fun way to pass the time. Lot's of cool items and snacks.

Staff were very friendly and attentive and service was top notch. The food was hot, fresh and excellent quality for country fixins'. All day breakfast is a plus and the chicken and dumplings are awesome. Be prepared to leave stuffed. 

I am so glad to finally have a location in Vegas. All the 1 star line complainers need to move along. Don't get in line if you don't have the patience."}
{"text":"Really is a lovely place. Nothing spectacular but truly a comforting dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best.i had A lot of good things.We went there and it was very crowded.The staff is very nice.The food quality is mediocre we all ordered the ribeye steak and they weren't prepared correctly and the meat was tasteless.You can either order 3 sides or A salad and A baked potato.My Aunt had to sent back the steak 3 times and it wasn't prepared correctly.She then had them bring her A hamburger and that was terrible as well and was sent back.They then brought her pork chops and she was ok.All the management came over to apologize and comped the meal.The dessert was ok they said ."}
{"text":"So happy they have one in Las Vegas it's the one thing I miss about living in Texas.... fabulous service everyone has a friendly face.... same great food I remember had the catfish breakfast perfectly fried and seasoned My husband had country fried steak and it was superb my favorite part is the yummy biscuits.... and no visit is complete without 20 candy sticks for two dollars love the country store"}
{"text":"This place hit my all-time comfort zone palates! If it was up to me, I would have breakfast here every Sunday for the rest of my life. 
If you're on a death row list, this is the place to request your last meal. 
I'm serious!!!
For starters, I am no pancake fan. But the last few times here I ordered their pumpkin pancakes and holy hell, they were explosively delicious. It took me back to when my grandma would make this Mexican dessert dish, Capirotada. 
If you could scratch and sniff my review it would make so much more sense. Unfortunately, you just simply have to take my word for it.
Any place that has breakfast all day is welcomed in my life. 
This place has it all, from breakfast and lunch to dinner. So many choices, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"It was my first time at any Cracker Barrel, and I live like a 30min drive away.....but I would do it all the time if I could for not only the awesome pancakes but even more so for the AMAZING service! Our server Domonique was especially amazing but from the hostess to the cashier they all made us smile with their sweet welcoming personalities. Cute atmosphere, awesome staff AND great food. It's a no brainer . See you again soon"}
{"text":"Our services was not that great . our dinner took forever. We maybe saw our sever twice, and even he acted as if he had better things to do..not very happy overall .was our first and last time at this location."}
{"text":"This place gets 4 stars from me because it is nice to have a cracker barrel somewhere close instead of always on the interstate.  The wait staff is always kind. I love to look around in the store. They have some cute stuff in there.  I love that they sell local college gear.  We have eaten here numerous times and as of lately it is a bit of an hit and miss thing.  Sometimes the food is great and you leave satisfied and other times it is just okay.  I asked for my turkey bacon to be crispy and when it arrived limp I asked for it to be cooked some more and I was told that it wasn't possible to make turkey bacon crispy (the problem with that is that I eat turkey bacon all the time so I know that you can make it crispy)  I was pretty dissapointed with that.   My husband always gets the same thing which is the country fried chicken plate and he always seems happy with it."}
{"text":"We stop at the Cracker Barrel when we are traveling.  It has a good variety of food and serves breakfast all day which is nice.  No complaints about the quality of food and service here I like to stick to the catfish, cod, trout, or salads and haven't been disappointed yet.  The wait can sometimes be long but once you are in they have enough staff to handle the crowds even when it's packed."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, good ole home cooking.  We shopped afterwards and staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, unlimited biscuits and cornbread. MUST try the apple dumplin dessert. It's a little big, perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"The food is subpar.  The desserts are actually better than anything on the menu.  The breakfasts are better than the lunch and dinner meals.  The lunch and dinner meals are mehhhhh.  Our waitress was very sweet.  
Chantelle was her name.  I don't like it when servers call you pet names, but I let it slide with her only because I felt she was really sincere."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  My friend and I went to have a great breakfast/lunch. We sit down and our waitress comes up to the table and my friend says first I just wanna say we would like extra biscuits!  (We love them) and with the worst attitude Jen (our waitress) says they come with the meal. We knew that!  Well my friend started ordering things she wanted and Jen said why don't you just get this! It comes with more stuff. Well my friend didn't want that so when she declines Jen seemed irritated about it!  Anyway our food comes out and she did not bring us the extra biscuits we asked for!  And when we asked for them she again seemed pissed we asked!  WORST WAITRESS EVER!   She really put a dampener on the rest of our day!  I have never felt so unwanted at a restaurant before!"}
{"text":"Needed a pick me up and stopped in for a late breakfast. I usually just have an assortment of fries and it never disappoints!

I'd like to recognize my waitress, Amanda K, who was a gem! She was very attentive and even brought me some tea for the road! Amanda K, you have such a warm energy and your smile is so infectious! Thanks so much for all you do!!"}
{"text":"Tourist trap complete with a gift shop. Place is clean and the service is the best part. Food is bland and overpriced."}
{"text":"Had the two meat breakfast combo, which includes 3 eggs, two strips of bacon, two sausage patties and southern grits on the side. Everything was awesome and they even provided a side order of biscuits n gravy.  Probably ate my allotment of calories for the day, but a very reasonable price and dining experience. The staff was friendly, and to say, my favorite staff member was the cashier Joann. She was polite, warmhearted and truly just a good person. She greeted us upon arrival, and seated us promptly,  since the hostess was not at the booth. During the exit, she inquired about our dining experience and was concerned about our meal. The waitress was prompt, and courteous, and attentive to our meal. 5 stars for cleanliness, prompt service, and good meal.  Thx"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in our visit on yesterday. I spent 70 bucks total I bought a cast iron skillet while waiting 45 mins to be seated. I know there is only 2 new locations and that there will be long waiting times. But after waiting so long and being seated, NO orange juice at 10 am, Our  biscuits did not come out on time we had to ask 3 different people they finally brought out hard biscuits with hard butter packs, no plates for the 5 of us to eat. But to top that our food came out super cold, I sent mine back but the other guest were so upset they just through their napkins and stated they were over it. Spoke with the Manager they did not offer any compensation for the cold food. They said we will take it back and make new ones so you can take home we didn't want to take home we wanted breakfast their.  We had to leave for a Christmas picture appointments we were running late. I can't believe as long as we waited for Craker Barrel to come to  Las Vegas only to be served horrible cold food and given poor service. They need new management and a cook manager that is experienced in heavy guest services."}
{"text":"First I want to start by saying our waitress was amazing and the food quality is NO reflection of her service. Came here with my 4yr old, who really only cares about getting a toy, not eating the food. He got 1 pancake, which 2 waitresses commented was really small, but he wasnt going to eat it all there any way, just the fact of food quality. They offered to have it remade but im easy, its fine, hes 4 with a small appetite. He also got 2 scrambled eggs and milk (carton milk never tastes right to me). It was lunch time so i ordered the ruben and a tea. The sandwich was only hot in the very center and the fries were room temperature and very dark. Of course someone other than your waitress delivers the food. I wasnt real hungery anyway but wanted to at least let the kitchen know the food was not coming out good. Our waitress came and asked how things were, i mentioned the fries and she offered to have them remade and would take my tea off the bill. I told her it was ok, just thought she may want to let them know. She ended up bringing more fries, they were hot but still most of them over fried."}
{"text":"Great Food. Descent Service. Huge Portions. Really busy quick service saying we were a party of four, and packed with people. Cool shop packed with expensive nic nacks."}
{"text":"Good points:
 *My apple BBQ chicken was flavorful and delicious.  
 *2 out of 3 friends had a delicious meal as well (chicken and dumplings, and catfish)

Room for improvement:
  *The waiter wasn't clearing out dishes as our meal progressed. 
 * Drinks weren't being refilled unless we asked for it. 
 *The third friend in our group ordered the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and it came out cold (not even luke warm). When they reheated it, the meatloaf was still not warm."}
{"text":"First time here. No wait to get seated. Waited 10 mins to be acknowledged by server. Server took our order with eaten corn on the cob in hand. Brought food out before side salads. I told server to re fire our plates after salads, oh we will, she said. As she setting down our salads the same plates were brought back to us. Oh I'll make sure there re fired now she says. Food comes back out with extra side of fries. I dont need extra fries. I want good food and service. Green beans were mush, country fried steak was greasy, because it was put back in oil to heat up. , and the side of fries I didnt even want were cold. What's the big deal. Is it to much to ask to take care of customers. By the way milk never delivered, and what's the use of offering cornbread and biscuits if you're not gonna bring them."}
{"text":"We normally love cracker barrel and love the food we get.  However, this was another one of those \"different\" experiences.

There were three of us and we were there for breakfast.  We thought it unusual that the breakfast menu did not include omelettes.  What breakfast menus don't have omelettes on them?  The server told us they make omelettes even though they aren't on the menu.  So, this is what two of us ordered.

The cheddar cheese omelette was probably the worst we had ever received.  The 3-egg mixture was so flat and spred out you could hardly tell it was egg.  The same was with the cheese.  It was really awful.

The server was great but we'll never order another omelette from Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Normally love Cracker Barrel restaurants -- normally.  This time I ordered a side dish.  It was the seasonal fruit dish.  It was absolutely ridiculous.  At $2.50 it included two small pineapple bits, 2 blackberries and 4 boysenberries.  That was an insult.  Everyone else was fine with their pancakes.   See the picture of one I found online advertising the fruit dish.  It was sure bigger than I received.  I sent it back."}
{"text":"This place is awful.  Before i showed up i already assumed there was going to be a long wait which i was prepared for.  The wait was about an hour. I was ok with that. The little gift store was entertaining and the rocking chairs outside was nice to sit on and relax while waiting.  Once we were called in for our table we had terrible service.  Without writing a full paragraph i'm going to summarize it.  Our server kept disappearing for long periods of time.  Every table that our server had was not getting any of the food brought to our tables.  All the tables around us that were seated 10 mins or more was able to get their drinks, food, and then bill and was out the door before we had any food brought to our table.  When the food was finally brought to our table it was only half.  My fiance only had half of what she ordered and the server said she will bring the other half when its ready.  My food came out after my fiance ate her half plate.  Then once i was finished the server brought her other half of the plate.  Getting a refill on the drinks never took place because the server never came back.  When it was time for the bill we just went up to the counter to find our check since our server was gone once again.  Plus all the food we had delivered to our table was cold.  I wasn't going to write a bad review on here but when i contacted cracker barrel on their website they never contacted me back.  I would give 1 star, but the gift shop staff was very friendly.  I will never come back to this place again"}
{"text":"Honestly I will never come to this establishment again. I have been here 3 times and the service has always been terrible, and this time my food was cold my eggs and bacon from the mamma's breakfast were like lukewarm , the plate was hotter than the food. The pancakes were burnt and were a little hard. Please don't go here if you don't have to."}
{"text":"I must be aging out of Cracker Barrel.  Maybe I'll get back to it, because there are plenty of old folks there.  But right now, they are getting awfully loud.

The service was good - in fact, one of the better rounds of service that I can recall having lately.  But I ordered some plate with a sampling of meat, and received one piece of bacon, a piece of sausage, some ham, eggs and one piece of toast.  For something like $7.  My wife added cheese to her eggs and grits and was charged separately for each - at $0.99 a pop.

I would rather eat at the Waffle House."}
{"text":"I see you've managed to extract yourself from the Wal-Mart parking lot across the freeway, so chances are you want to escape the madness.  If that's the case, you pretty well have two choices for eating - the Cracker Barrel and the Bob Evans.  There isn't really anything wrong with either, but I'd probably pick the Cracker Barrel if I were you.  The staff is nicer and the choices are better.

You also get the Cracker Barrel store, if you care about that sort of thing (I don't, but some people do).  Keep your eyes open for the clearance section, where you might be able to save a bit on the overpriced merchandise from last season.

Also, don't try and look for anything that is fat-free.  There isn't much of anything on the menu that will get you there.  This is Cracker Barrel (and North Carolina, for that matter).  If you want fat free, try California or something.

Lastly, if you want to get down to a single peg, try leaving the center hole open on one of the sides, and work from the corners.  It's usually the best strategy."}
{"text":"As with Eric, I'll have to say that this is one of the first (if not the first) Cracker Barrel that I've ever seen that isn't on (or awfully close to) an interstate.  Maybe they are branching out.

Whatever the case, we stopped by on a weeknight evening - a Thursday if you're keeping track at home - and also found that they were packed.  Very odd indeed.  I don't know if people are just jonesing for something different, but it was an interesting surprise.

While we did get in quickly, and the food was pretty standard Cracker Barrel fare, the similarities ended there.

I'd like to say that they've worked out their kinks.  We're talking a chain here, and they've now been open for some six weeks, so it shouldn't have anything to do with opening jitters, but more than once I was left sitting with an empty glass, and it was a solid half hour after we ordered before we even saw our server again.

It was so bad, in fact, that we actually threatened to leave if the food wasn't there quickly.  Miraculously, it was, leading me to believe that it wasn't a backup in the kitchen as I had thought, but a problem with the server.  Ultimately, we'll never know, but I think it likely that we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service, seems overstaffed  & I have to wonder how many will be laid off in a few weeks, or right after the holidays. 

Chic & Dumplings (smaller portion) was good - I'd have added peas & carrots to it for color. Cucumber/tomato/onion salad excellent. Ordered fried apples, got baked apple pie filling. Good, but not accurate.  Corn bread was a little dry, not uncommon w/ cornbread but had hoped for a better product. 

Too many people coming by to ask if everything was OK. became distracting although everyone was very nice & polite.   

We arrived about 2:15 pm & no wait!!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good. Waitress was very attentive. Fried apples and grits were very good. Other food I ordered is  normally better than today."}
{"text":"Excited for a Vegas Cracker Barrel and it lived up to the hype!  Fried chicken was great.  Hash brown casserole was great!  Priced right!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, staff was courteous and friendly. Love the biscuits and apple butter"}
{"text":"I couldn't get past all the dust and dirt all over the place. It was on the walls, the ceiling and all the displays on the walls. The place needs a good cleaning, including all the pictures and knickknacks. Bathroom was not clean at all and looked like it hadn't been touched in days."}
{"text":"Based on our most recent visit I'm updating my rating to three stars. We typically have a decent experience at the Cracker Barrel and our most recent experience was just that.  The service was good and at a decent pace. The food was served hot and our orders were accurate. Our waitress was friendly and there wasn't too long a wait to be seated.  I'm hoping that this is the experience we'll continue to have.  It's been hit or miss lately."}
{"text":"Their food is always so good and all of their servers have been incredibly kind! My only complaint is how slow our service tends to be even when it's not busy. Anyways, if you go, don't be in a hurry, and get some of their apple cider! It's the best you can find in Buckeye!"}
{"text":"So we did the online wait list and when we got here we only waited like 2 minutes which was great! They proceeded to take us to our table but they sat someone else by accident so we had to wait 10-15 minutes anyway. We got to our table and the waitress came pretty quickly, she was attentive enough a little slow though. The food wasnt that great! My daughter didnt like her pancakes and my hubby didnt like his french toast. Their gravy is absolutely disgusting! They should be ashamed to even put that on tables. My son got the chicken fried chicken with the nasty gravy that he didnt eat. So all in all a waste of my time and money, I will not be returning to Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and thought it was great, so my Dad and I came back today while we were in town. We had a ten minute wait but when we got to our seats, half the restaurant was empty. The hostess tried to seat us at a dirty table, but a waitress (not ours) walked by and told her to move us elsewhere. Then it took our server ten minutes to show up and take our drink order. She brought that back promptly, even though I had ordered an iced coffee and she brought a hot one. I didn't ask her to fix it because she seemed to be in an awful mood. She barely spoke and was very distracted. A lady at a table beside us, who was alone, waited so long for the waitress to notice her that she just got up and left without ever having her order taken. Then we ordered breakfast. Ten minutes later, the waitress said she thought they were out of syrup, but she would check. When we got our food, my dad reminded her about the syrup and she said all they had was sugar free and shrugged. My dad told her that was better than nothing. Then she brought two bottles of regular syrup and said \"y'all got lucky.\"
Some items in our order weren't correct but we weren't difficult about it and just ate what we were given. We got maybe one drink refill, after stopping our waitress and asking for it. Then my dad had to seek her out to ask for a to-go box.

We always eat at a Cracker Barrel when we travel and this one had the slowest, poorest service of any we have been to. The food was really good and the store was organized and clean. The only thing negative about it was the waitress, but the service is half the experience and it just wasn't good today."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great place to eat. The food is excellent and no problems on the waiting side."}
{"text":"Yeah! Finally Cracker Barrel opened in Las Vegas. We went the second day it opened even though I knew it would be crowded. The wait was about 30 minutes but it was fun to look around in the store before we were seated. I even found an item that I have been looking at for my house. The service was excellent, especially since they just opened. My waiter was in training but he did a good job. I gave this review less stars because the food was so bad. The grites were blah. The gravy had no taste and was runny. My ham was overcooked and so tough I could barely cut it. After one bite I had to leave it because didn't want to choke. The noise level was outrageous. BUT, I will go again when things have calmed down a bit. Hopefully the kitchen will improve. I want to go to lunch sometime to try their famous fried chicken. Hopefully it will be as advertised."}
{"text":"Service was slooooooow. We arrived at 10:35am, it took 20 minutes to take our drink order. We went ahead and ordered our food and it took another 25 minutes to get our food. Then our waitress disappeared until it was time to bring our check. Unless you have 90 minutes to eat lunch, I would pass this restaurant over for another location."}
{"text":"We crave Cracker Barrel when we travel....mostly because we don't have one in San Diego.  Their cheesy hashbrowns are yummy!  This is not really a \"good for you\" place to eat.  But they always deliver good food and good service.  Plus, the country store smells so good when you walk in!"}
{"text":"My wife loves this place, me not so much. The food is okay but nothing special. I have recently ordered food to go and each time the order was wrong or incomplete. This morning I ordered chicken fried steak, eggs over medium, crispy hash browns and grits. What I got was eggs over easy, they were so runny I almost threw up. They gave me 3 servings of gravy and no grits or hash browns. The server who gave me my order claimed she checked and everything was correct, what a lie. I will never eat here again. What a waste of money I should have went to McDonald's at least you can count on getting what you ordered. I guess takeout customers are lowest priority, why not they don't notice the problem until it's too late. I wish I could give negative star ratings. 

Why do I think things would change? I told the person who took my order that there is always a problem with my order. Again I ordered chicken fried steak with over medium, well eggs I said I like the yoke soft not runny and what did I get ? The runniest eggs ever! This time I did throw up. Again another waste of money I'm so glad I don't tip takeout. -(negative)"}
{"text":"We eat here often, I love and CRAVE their chicken and dumplings. When I'm in the mood for a home cooked meal and don't feel like cooking, this is my go-to place! Service has always been attentive for the most part. And we love to poke around in the General Store for some unique items after we've filled our bellies."}
{"text":"This isn't the first time I've frequented this Cracker Barrell, but my and my friends passed up Chompie's for some good ole CB. 

We were seated quickly, and it was pretty poppin' as it was a Saturday morning. Ordered the usual, a Raspberry Lemonade and Grandpa's Breakfast whatever. I was super stoked, especially since I was starving, but there is something about the presentation that leaves something to be desired. Translate - Huge plate, small serving. Which I don't mind considering the price, but make it look good?

Anyways it was good. And our waitress had some sass for my friends that needed a \"lesson\" that morning, haha."}
{"text":"A pretty decent location with good \"American\" food. I would recommend this as a place to take picky Americans and your grandparents. The store is pretty nifty, if not cheap, as well."}
{"text":"Good as usual
One of the best choices for a good meal
Huge portions. 
Great service 
Almost like grandma did"}
{"text":"If you like good old fashioned southern food, then Cracker Barrel is the place for you. They have a huge menu, big portions, great prices, friendly service, and tasty food, which is pretty much all the points a restaurant needs to get for a great review in my book.

This was the first time I have been to this Cracker Barrel, and all my other experience with Cracker Barrel's has been in Arizona. It was pretty much exactly like the one I have been to before, with rocking chairs on the patio area (no outdoor dining, just to wait) and a shop full of country style knick-knacks in front of the dining area. They also sell some off brand soda's and candy.

The menu here is one of the biggest I have ever seen at any restaurant, to the point that they even have a huge list of side dishes (well over 20). We had Lisa for our server, and I swear she gave the best menu rundown I have ever heard. She knew everything and could answer any question, and was just one of the friendliest servers we have ever had.

Entrees range from $8 to $12, and they are all southern style. They are known for their chicken and dumplings, chicken fried steak and ham, among other things. I love that they have a dinner sampler, which comes with ham, meatloaf and chicken & dumplings. As a person that loves trying different things, this is a meal for me! The chicken and dumplings is probably the best of the items I named above, as it is juicy and soaked in a delicious gravy. The ham and meatloaf were also very good, though nothing that special.

Most of the dishes come with your choice of two or three sides, which as mentioned above they have a large variety to choose from. Heck, they even have sides you can only get on certain days of the week. I got the fried okra, hash brown casserole, and turnip greens. All the sides taste great and I want to go back and try them all.

In addition, the meals come with corn bread muffins and biscuits. The corn bread is on the savory side, and I prefer sweet corn bread, but if you like it saltier you will probably enjoy it. I love the biscuits and I suggest you get a side of apple butter to go with them.

I've been to Cracker Barrel's before for breakfast, and they do a great job on that to. Just like the huge portions at dinner, their breakfast are big to. They have a breakfast sampler with ham, bacon, sausage, eggs, biscuits, grits, hash browns and gravy for around $10. You just cant beat that variety and size for the price. They also have great pancakes and French toast if you have a morning sweet tooth.

My only real criticism here is that some of the food is a little on the bland side for my pallet, but then again I'm one of those people that loves heavily spiced food, so that is largely a personal preference issue. I have also been told that this Cracker Barrel often has large wait times, though we got right in the night we came, and we were a party of five.

The biggest compliment I can give to the Cracker Barrel is that everything here taste home made. It reminds me of my grandmother's cooking, who is from Arkansas and knows here southern food. Actually my grandmother was with us when we came here and she loved everything about it.

If you want a large southern style meal that taste like it came out of someone's home kitchen, then bring your appetite and stop by here. I'm not usually big on chain restaurants, but Cracker Barrel just get's everything right. I look forward to coming here for some comfort food again."}
{"text":"As usual, this Cracker Barrel was packed! The store was hard to get through with so many people waiting for a table. The host was very rude when my husband approached him (after waiting in line) to be put in the queue. The waiter said \"yeah, well I have a lot going on right now. So you need to give me a minute.\" All my husband had said was, \"Hi, we need a table for 6\" I understand he may have been stressed but that was very unprofessional. The waitress was nice but she was very unattentive. At one point, my mom had to get up from the table and chase down the waitress to get what we needed. The food was good and consistent with Cracker Barrel standards."}
{"text":"Meh!! It's alright , first time here ! 

Felt very welcomed , but I had 1/2 pound cheese burger , the patty wasn't that great ! They called it a 1/2 pound bacon cheese burger , but my patty was literally 5 times smaller then the bread , so therefore I just ate bread , patty is very dry ! Like they were smashing the juice. 

I'd have to be craving in order to eat here. Service was better then the food ."}
{"text":"had the Best Oatmeal there yesterday,it was steel oats which I love with dryed cranberries,golden raisins,pecans and fried apples,it was so yummy!I\"ll definetly be going back!Finally a breakfast worth raving about! Thank You!!"}
{"text":"If your grandparents are in town, then they will probably like Cracker Barrel.  Very bland menu. My waitress was a little odd and really seemed unorganized with her tables.  I ordered the Uncle Herschel's Favorite .Two Eggs with Grits, Sawmill Gravy and Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits along with Real Butter and the best Preserves and Grilled Pork Chop is what's on the menu.  However, the grits were really runny, eggs overcooked, the \"grilled\" pork chop need salt nor was it grilled and the \"best\" Preserves, I have no idea what that's supposed to be.  I really don't think Uncle Herschel would like the dish!  My coffee cup was never filled until I was ready to go.  It's cheap but really not what I had expected from Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Good Southern Cooking at it's finest.

When entering the restaurant it feels like you are walking into an old country general store. I like the vibe and all neat stuff they sell inside including toys, candy, rocking chairs etc. 

We ate here for breakfast and it was just at delicious as I remember it from years ago. We don't have Cracker Barrel's in Southern Cali. The portions were pretty big and our waitress remembered all of our different orders perfectly. I reccommend the fried apples here... hot, sticky, cinnamon apples combined into a celebration in my belly. A lot of country breakfast variations on the menu for breakfast but also had a fresh fruit, and low carb options for those that want a different option. 

Service was nice and I loved the wooden chairs and tables around the place..it gave it a very rustic look. :)"}
{"text":"Always love to stop into Cracker Barrel when in the Phoenix Area. This was my sisters first time eating here and she absolutely loved it. Came in on a Sunday morning and there was no wait which was great! Food was amazing as always. The bacon was so crispy and the pancakes were extra fluffy. Our service was great, can't wait to be back in the area for another visit."}
{"text":"In college, ate a hot turkey sandwich at least once a week. For those not in the know, a hot turkey is an open-faced turkey sandwich, mashed potatoes, covered in gravy. I really wanted that tonight and figured this place would have it. They don't but our awesome server Tommy made it for me anyway!  

So next time you visit this cracker barrel, ask to sit in Tommy's section for the best service."}
{"text":"I'm giving this wonderful restaurant 3 stars for the following reason.  The wait time to get in on a Monday night at 7:30 was nearly an hour. And once we got seated it took over 30 minutes to bring our food. 

I do want to clarify a few things though. This restaurant had only been open for 2 weeks. It is the first Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas. It's understanding that it would be busy.  

When we checked in they said 40 minutes so we decided to wait it out.  I did like the fact that they had large rocking chairs and checkers to play on the deck. You could try them out and actually buy them from the store!  (Nice touch)

The food was extremely yummy. But not sure it was worth the wait. Good thing we had trail mix with us!  
Will I be back?    Yes!  But maybe I'll wait until the newness calms down."}
{"text":"-Excellent breakfast selection. Anything and everything!

-Love the miniature bottle of pancake syrup.

-Decent prices and just right portions

-Friendly waitress, refilled our coffee and cleared away dirty dishes.

-Cute gift shop.

-Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Was driving home from Buckeye to California and as we are in freeway we see Cracker Barrel. We just had to stop cause it had been over 20 years since we ate at one. We used to eat at the place all the time on the east coast. So we wanted to see if is still the same old country food or different. We were happy to know it was just as good as we remembered! We were very pleased and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Customer service is excellent. The food was horrible. My food choice was Mom's plate (not really sure of the name) it was three (very greasy/oily) pancakes they say buttery, but okay. The butter for my pancakes were frozen and taste freezer burned. My scrabbled eggs taste like they'd been left out for an hour and we're reheated. The three peices of crispy bacon were okay if you wipe off the brown left over grease. My decaf coffee was nasty. My creamer taste old. 
The waitress was the best part of the visit she was trying to help the food and coffee situation out but, I'd already made up my mind as an unsatisfied customer. This was my second and last visit. Million dollar question would, I ever recommend this place of dinning to a family or friend? Absolutely, NOT!!! Even if it was free -;"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something more home-cooked feeling this is a wise choice. I felt like our food came out pretty slow. Our waiter kept up with our beverages in the blink of an eye so the slow food must have been due to the chef. We all ordered breakfast (served all day BTW) mine wasnt fresh off the griddle hot. I wasnt too impressed with my meal but my daughter and my boyfriend lovedddd theirs and I know we will be going back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so good. I love all the food .  All the employees are so friendly they are the second reason why we come back.  Andy is so attentive and friendly and very good at her job ."}
{"text":"Super cute place with great service and great breakfasts. The breakfast selection was varied and prices were reasonable! It felt homey and comfortable in the restaurant which made the food extra delicious!"}
{"text":"What can you say? It's Cracker Barrel. You've been to one, you've seen them all. Biggest differences would probably be the service. In my past experience, they've been very slow, but this visit wasn't bad even though we had a new waitress, albeit it was a 6pm dinner. No surprises at this location. You get what you order, nothing amazing, nothing terrible. I call it the nationwide diner."}
{"text":"Yuck..

I thought it was related to Cracker Barrel Cheese. It's a cute country style store.. if you are looking for candy from the past and rockers..but do not go for food

They do have a really good Sweet Tea..

Say no the dumpling and chicken! I've never had it so I had to try but now I wish I didn't!"}
{"text":"went here for my first time last week and i expected more because the parking lot is always packed. the waitress and staff overall were nice but the food was just OK. the biscuits were dry, gravy flavorless. the ham was a little salty and my bacon was hard. 

the chairs/high chairs were sticky...

they do give a lot of food though and their gift shop is amazing. I've never seen so much stuff in one place. lol"}
{"text":"We gave our names party of 6 Sunday and told 45 minute wait . Took 1 hour to get seated 30 minutes more to place order then 30 more minutes to get served . Spending almost 2 hours we talked to the manager on duty who could care less. Our food was ok and the waitress was apologetic . The manager offered to adjust the bill however since staff is not properly trained and restaurant understaffed I will never return to this location thus refused a price adjustment . Don't go here on Sunday's !!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here about a week after opening around 9:30/10pm and the wait was 50 minutes. It ended up being around a half hour, but we were very surprised that it was so busy near closing time! It was very hot outside but thankfully on the porch there's a few fans. Service was pretty good, occasionally one of our drinks would be empty but our server stopped by frequently. I ordered a build your own side platter. I remember ordering this often when I was younger so I decided to try it out. The green beans are AWESOME! The corn, not so much, it is clearly frozen. French fries were good, but that's hard to mess up. Mac & Cheese had the nasty fuzzy texture so I didn't eat much of that. I also ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup...it was yummy...but it came out barely above lukewarm. My girlfriend ordered a couple entrees so she could sample a few things and nothing was WOW in quality or taste. Overall, disappointing and not what I remembered from my childhood back east. Maybe it's because they have to import everything to the desert? Also want to mention my girlfriend did get sick from eating here. We speculate that it's because food isn't kept at a high enough temperature. Nothing came out hot. Hmm..."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Batrel. The Fort Mill, South Carolina location is my favorite. They have a great gift shop and the food is fantastic. The hashbrown casserole is scrumptious. The apple butter is amazing and I absolutely love the biscuits and gravy. I will definitely be back the next time in town."}
{"text":"Good home cooking.  Fun sides like hash brown casserole, turnip greens and dumplings.,  fried chicken is the best!  Service is also pretty good"}
{"text":"Always will love this place no matter where you go in the USA there's always a Cracker Barrel somewhere.  I always like getting the fare and fit breakfast from here the yogurt is yummy. I'm not a pancake fan but I decided to get some for the first time here and OMG to die for. The pinto beans are always my favorite at lunch or dinner.  Oh and the shopping in the lobby your always going to find the cutest stuff and some good candy.  Never had a bad customer service experience here."}
{"text":"I don't get here very often but try to come when I see one. Food is always wonderful Services good places cute obviously nostalgic old time. The little general store is a hoot to shop around. You see stuff you haven't seen since you were a kid. The prices are good on some of the things although I notice their portions have definitely gone down to try and keep the prices low. But all in all a very nice experience"}
{"text":"Best blueberry pancake I have ever had in my life!  They have warm blueberry syrup and pure maple syrup.  Combine the two for a taste explosion!  The hash brown casserole is so delicious and the biscuits are so softy and wonderful.  I love the country atmosphere and all of the neat things in their store.  Our waitress Miralinda (hope I spelled it right) was the best waitress I've ever had at a Cracker Barrel.  I never had an empty coffee cup or water glass and she was slammed with tables.  Give that woman a raise!  Can't wait to go back for another blueberry pancake!"}
{"text":"Wow! Horrible and rude service! It took forever for our server to come to greet us at our table. A party was sat right behind us at the exact same time as we sat down. They had a different server than our table, long story short they were finishing their meal and leaving as our food barley came out. And we were sat at the same exact time!!! In a city that thrives on hospitality, we hated the service here and WILL NOT RETURN! I hope management changes things fast!!!"}
{"text":"All good, they don't make dumplins like me though!,"}
{"text":"Love this place!  From Arizona to Tennessee I have visited and never had a bad meal! Good ole' comfort food! The tastiest food. Great presentation, they care! Hot syrup! Seperate plates for eggs & pancakes, Frosty mugs for milk.  Fun shopping while you wait or after you eat!"}
{"text":"I've heard about this place and being near by, I figured, why not? Service is sub par, although they all seem very friendly, they were also very unorganized. First thing I ordered before anything was biscuits&gravy, never got it, wasn't charged for it. No big deal. (Although I really was craving it). We had to ask three different people for straws. Yes, straws. 

Honestly food was ok at best. I wasn't expecting my world to be rocked, and it certainly wasn't.  Ambiance was nice, seems like a decent family restaurant. There is a huge fireplace in the middle, which makes it feel \"homey\". I really feel it's more like 2.5 star, but I'm being generous and giving it 3. Will I be back? Ehh, maybe? But definitely nothing imminent."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Crack Barrel.  They have it in the Midwest which my family is also from.  This time I finally got a chance to try it during breakfast.

My wife said they had to wait an hour in Chicago in order to be seated at Cracker Barrel.  But the location we went to in Phoenix, we were immediately seated.

The service was excellent.  I wanted apple juice and the server figured out a way to accommodate me, even though they ran out.  They were really attentive.

The food was great!  I had the redundant Chicken Fried Chicken with biscuits and gravy, grits, eggs over easy and a casserole hash.  It was so good.. the chicken was fried perfectly, nice and crunchy, tasty.  The biscuits were melt in your mouth near flaky texture and gravy was good and tasty.  Grits were good.  The hashbrown casserole was nice and hearty.  The meal that I had is called Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast.

My wife enjoyed her meal as well.

Prices are decent.

They also have a store as you enter so that you can get some gifts for others or things for yourself.

Cool spot.

They even sell furniture outside.  I saw a chair that I liked.

Cracker Barrel, we need you in Seattle!"}
{"text":"My friend and I drove to Utah to go to Cracker Barrel and it was so delicious! When I heard they were coming out here, I go so excited we don't have to drive so far. I was sadly let down when I came here to eat.

I'm not sure if it's the hype in the valley or what, but it does not have the same feel as the one I went to. It seemed very rushed in there, and we barely saw our waitress. Almost as if they don't have enough staff working.  I ordered catfish with with greens, mac & cheese, and broccoli.  I had asked for hot sauce right when the food came out and it took a good while for it to get to me.She seemed overwhelmed. My mom liked her food, although I don't remember what she ordered. I know we both had a side of cornbread, which was the driest cornbread I had ever eaten. No exaggeration. Literally crumbled when you went to pick it up.  The hush puppies were tasty, and those were gone in no time.  

I do love the store with all the candies from childhood, games and trinkets. If you are looking for special gifts for a special someone, you are bound to find something here. To find good food on the other hand, I'm not too sure.  Maybe I'll go back and try another day."}
{"text":"We had a family breakfast here and as expected for a Sunday morning it was packed. We waited probably over twenty minutes and I wasn't happy when I saw we were going to be sat at a table literally right behind the hostess booth where everyone walks in. Whatever. Let's just eat! 

I decided to try one of the special new items, some cinnamon roll type french toast that comes with eggs and meat, I ordered sausage patties and scrambled. When our drinks came our waitress didn't know which glass had sprite or water and we all had to taste what was given to us to find which was sprite. Then she messed up the order and there was an extra scrambled egg and bacon plate, but when I saw my dish it looked like they cracked an egg and split it in half then scrambled the half portion it was so small. So before she took the extra scrambled egg plate back to the kitchen to either throw away or give to another party I just asked if I could have them since my egg looked like barely anything. She did the right thing by giving into my request. It didn't matter though, because the eggs were flat and very salty. The sausage tasted odd. The only thing I enjoyed was the french toast and it was almost too sweet so I didn't finish.

Since some of the family members hadn't seen each other in awhile we sat for some time after we finished eating just chatting and catching up, and a few of us noticed we were getting some rude looks from the staff and management as if to say, \"ok you're done get up and leave so we can get more customers in here to make us more money!\"

Alright, we left, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great home style country food, long wait time, don't look for heart smart on the menu and take a lot of Plavix"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've visited the CB in Ohio and the quality is just a great as Ohio's location. Arrive early to be seated quickly. Their pancakes are buttery and crisp, so delicious! Those pancakes aren't for the faint of heart (calories must be high up there) but they are so worth it. Their coffee is so good too! 

The service was a little everywhere but they just opened and everyone's trying to settle in. Logan was very sweet and was helping our table out a lot even though he wasn't our waiter, which just goes to show how much the employees care . 

Just like all CB locations, they have a country store where you can purchase a lot of great merch like Yankee Candles and even CB syrup, coffee and pancake mix (yeap, the same stuff they use in their kitchens!) 

Would definitely return here, hands down!"}
{"text":"my father and I went there for breakfast.  The place was empty except for two tables.  My dad ordered his regular oatmeal with two corn muffins.  how can you go wrong with oatmeal, well instead of serving milk with the oatmeal they served those little tiny containers of half and half the ones which go with the coffee.  I ordered the multi-grain pancakes which came out under cooked and pasty, sent them back.  The next order or multi-grain pancakes came out way over cooked and dry like card board, sent them back. Then the manager came out and said all the multi-grain and wheat pancakes are always dry, I said they should put that on the menu - multi-grain pancakes always dry.  Then I tried the blueberry pancakes, well it must not have been a pancake day as the blueberry pancakes tasted funny, all the blueberries were right in the middle of the pancakes and they too were dry and pasty.  The server was not much help saying things which contradicted the manager.  Can't anyone get an honest answer when they ask questions about the food."}
{"text":"I like the Cracker Barrell. The food is good, specifically the chicken noodle soup and the biscuits. The service at this location was also really good."}
{"text":"Wait is always long but the food and service is good. They have a great process of getting customers food out quick and getting you out of the restaurant. Always a great place to go when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service and a wonderful time. On a weekend you will wait a bit but that is expected for a good place. Living in California we visit family in Phoenix twice a year and eat at The Cracker Barrel 3x for breakfast over the weekend.   We will continue this trend. Highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"The family and I love Cracker Barrel.  We live in LA where we don't have any, so any time we get a chance to stop by one, we do.  This one has the same great food that they're famous for.  However, two stars must be deducted for the SLOW service. It's so slow, it's created a horrible back up and an unreasonable wait time.  On a Monday mid-morning in the off season (I shudder to think what a weekend would be like) it was 35+ minute wait for a seat and then 30+ minutes to get your order.  (Which was then completely wrong and had to be redone!).  If you do decide to stop, make sure you leave plenty of time and I'd advise you use the website to \"call ahead\", which I didn't know about until today."}
{"text":"Vegas could have done WITHOUT a Cracker Barrel here if I knew the service all the way down to the food would SUCK. My father and I absolutely love Cracker Barrel because being from South Carolina aside from Waffle House we made this our breakfast go to place. The guy that seated us (Dylan) definitely didn't know what he was doing. Then our server Stephen just needs to not be a server. We ordered our drinks AND food at the same time. We waited 15 minutes before I asked him where our drinks were and about time he brought that (now 20 minutes later) our food was being brought out. THEN Stephen messed up my father's order when my father clearly stated when ordering \"He doesn't eat meat (3 times),\" \"He didn't want meat\" and me telling him \"He's a Vegan.\" Then this clown saids, \"Oh I thought you were okay if the meat was still on there\" WHAT? My sausage was dry, eggs cold while my father's whole meal just wasn't good. The ONLY thing we could agree on liking was my French Toast AND that was it. The 2 stars are for the manager coming over to apologize to my father and the French Toast being to my liking. Other then that we'll stick to local breakfast spots and wait until we get to South Carolina (heck anywhere in the south) to get the BEST of what Cracker Barrel has to offer because this one in Vegas IS NOT IT AT ALL!"}
{"text":"The food was below average, my friends & I thought the eggs tasted fake. There was also mold in my fruit and staff did not care all too much. Just heads up if you decide to go here!"}
{"text":"Slave girl was super excited about trying this place since she has never had it before. I on the other hand had my fair share of Cracker Barrel when I used to be the road warrior crossing country. I never really loved the place but for my love I shall eat here one more time.

We arrived around dinner time. The wait wasn't long but we messed around on the rocking chair and browsed the store a little before getting seated.

The menu had a wide range of selections. Breakfast menu was also available even during the evenings. I had my eyes on 10oz ribeye steak, and slave girl got Friday fish fry. 

The fish fry came with 4 pieces of batter fried cod filets, fries and cole slaw. Slave girl told me the fish was dry and she really didn't enjoy it.

My ribeye came with 3 sides. I know my sides didn't make sense, but I got cheese grits, mashed potato, and steamed broccoli. I asked my steak to be cooked at medium rare but it came out well done. The server didn't have any issues and took it back to the kitchen. The second one was more rare, but there was no point for me kept sending the food back so I settled with the rare steak. The flavor was good but meat quality was not impressive. 

The service was strange... When we got there, we had multiple people coming to order our drinks. The real server we got was not bad but she wouldn't take our empty cups away and kept bringing new cups to the table. Eventually we ran out of room on our table and no one wanted to come take things away from the table. 

Love yourself and don't go there?"}
{"text":"Someone needs to tell the red haired woman that an appropriate greeting is, \"hello, welcome to our restaurant.. where would you like to sit?\" Not a sarcastic \"can I HELP you with something?\" She acted like I just busted into her living room instead of being their one and only customer who wanted to eat a meal."}
{"text":"One of our favorites in the Phoenix area. Some of the best breakfast in the West."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Had the mac and cheese and country green beans. The biscuits were good. Sis was insistent on trying it and since we were crunched on time we took it to-go. Took a while for the take out and prices are pretty high for the quality."}
{"text":"We've always been avid fans of Cracker Barrel. Every time we go on road trips to the East Coast and adjacent states of California, Arizona, Utah and Texas, we always look forward to seek out their stores. We love their food and their shops. We were so excited when this location was established coz it's closer to home. During the first 4 visits, everything was good. We got the same quality food that we've been used to having in their other locations. However, the last visit two weekends ago was a disaster. Their pancakes and steak were not the same as we usually have. When we mentioned it to our server, she said she has been hearing the same complaints from other customers. Had a recent chat with friend who also loves Cracker Barrel and she complained of the change, too. I'm doing this review for them to shape up and provide again the high quality food that we always expect from them. Giving 2 stars instead of one because of the very good service. At least, that is something they were able to maintain."}
{"text":"Love this place! I wish we can get some Cracker Barrels in Cali! had the Mama's french toast meal.. so Delicious! I thinks my only complaint would be the sausage patties, I get the size for the kids meals but for an adult meal? Anyway, can't go to Az without a stop at good 'ol Cracker Barrel, will definately be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order and it was terrible. Ordered the grilled chicken. I'm
Not sure what I got though. I'm guessing maybe the Cobb salad. The bacon in it was terrible the croutons were salty. Half our order was missing. When went back up pick up what they forgot to give us. All he offered for our inconvenience was one small
Lemonade. Thanks man!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel... Hate poor customer service.

Right off the bat I'm already not in the best mood having come home from the hospital at 5am and spent nearly 5 hours there trying to get through over 8 hours of contractions (only to find that there was no chance I was having this baby yet). *sigh* Anyway...in hopes to cheer me up my husband suggests we get some of my fav pancakes at Cracker Barrel (this is a big deal for us since we have been dieting for the last 4 months, plus we even had our trainer's approval for an epic cheat meal). I get to my table and sit down to find that I sat in a pile of watery chocolate milk....gross. 
I called someone over to complain and there was no \"Oh! I'm so sorry that you will be uncomfortable eating the rest of your breakfast with a wet sticky butt because we didn't properly wipe down or check the table and chairs for spill and crumbs. Please let me see what we can do to make up for it\" ...all I got was a new chair and measly \"oh sorry...\" 

I might be making a big deal out of this but that's gross and annoying! I really don't enjoy trying to eat my only cheat meal while feeling like I peed myself :( 

Moving on...
Food. Pancakes were great as usual. Eggs over easy were done just the way I like. 
I ordered turkey sausage but didn't get them until I almost finished my meal. Turns out one of the runners forgot who it was for and it sat in the window until someone remembered who it was for. 
Husband requested hot sauce and ketchup. Only the hot sauce showed up. Also, the butter he was given was grainy. 

Shannon G was our server. She was very polite and looked genuinely shocked and upset when she found out I  hadn't received my sausage. She offered to refill our apple ciders to make up for it (nice gesture!) but we were already full and ready to get outta there. Shannon, the extra star is because of you. 

Overall. I was full, but left more annoyed than when I came in, wet butt and all."}
{"text":"Well, it's a Cracker Barrel... and despite it's sorta creepy location, it's a good one. We have gone here a couple times for lunch and we're always in and out in no time. I was also surprised to find that you can eat semi healthy here as well... even though I heart their freakin amazing pancakes... MMMMMMMMMM.... I feel like Homer Simpson thinking about a doughnut. 

If you're looking some tasty and fast eats to get you out in time for your lunch break, this is the spot."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Cracker Barrel! Their food comes in a big portion and every bite is delicious. Everything I've tried on the menu has tasted great plus there is a store you can look at while you wait for a table or after you leave. Usually we never have to wait for a table! Great place!"}
{"text":"Very interesting eating for sure. Staff was friendly and fast,drinks and bread were served to us in a timely manner and refills right behind. The waitress helped explain the menu and food allergies to us which was very sweet. Milk is in everything so bring a lactaid pill which I forgot. I had the fish,kale and broccoli salad with mashed potatoes and beans. Totally southern style cooking with the deep fry and salt on everything. The biscuits were so sweet and oozing butter. My meal was 1200 calories so I had to work out the rest of the night but it was worth it. Relaxed atmosphere and a little country store with my favorite Texas soda Big Red. I would go here again but it'll be a long time."}

{"text":"i never have an empty stomach or a bad time here. theres this one waiter there who is a teacher, he's super friendly (think maybe his name is mike) get him he's the best. just watch out on sunday mornings......long wait time to get a table 20min or so."}
{"text":"We moved to hudson about 6months ago from cleveland and figured cracker barrel is a safe bet. Not so much.........the food is always good but the service is another story. Since my fiance' is a server herself we try to keep an open mind and give them multiple chances but 9 out of ten times we go here we get bad service. Ive ordered things specially that servers tell me is \"no problem\" only to have my next server the next time i come in try and argue with me about how it can't be done that way. I mean how hard is it to add a slice of ham and tomato to a grilled cheese sandwich and charge me for it ? Or to substitute something on an order and charge me the difference. The tables and menus aren't always very clean either. My last straw was we went on on a wednesday for lunch and it was fairly cold outside so there were only 3customers in there. Place was dead. We waited fairly long to even be seated while the register girl just stared at us. After being seated we put our menus down cause we already knew what we wanted. We had enough time to witness the manager go into the back for firewood and stock the fireplace, another couple get their food then a brand new couple get brought in, seated and get their food and we still hadn't seen a waitress. We walked out and a waitress who was cleaning up the other side said \"thanks for coming have a good time\". Never again"}
{"text":"Been here many times. The service is typically lackluster. They keep the place way too cold.  People were putting on sweatshirts and it's almost 100 degrees outside. They never seem to get the order right. During this visit My husband ordered a large milk and it came regular size. I ordered my and my son's bacon cooked but not deep-fried and not crispy but it came completely deep fried and rock like.   My husband ordered hash browns but they brought him hash brown casserole instead. He had to repeat his request for extra butter. I had to ask for the biscuits that came with my meal. I ordered my eggs poached medium and they were definitely more like poached soft. We had to wait for different pieces of our meal to arrive. We asked for the manager at the register and he seemed too busy to really be bothered. There was no smile, no cordial greeting and no apology. He looked at us like we were annoying and making it all up. He said \"I made an adjustment to your bill\" and walked away. He took $6 off our $36.00 bill. Ridiculous. We go here quite often because there aren't all that many breakfast places but it will probably be quite some time before we go back."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table, split group over 3 different areas (big group but inconvenient nonetheless) hour wait for simple food and mixed up orders/missing orders. My friend are a steak with a spoon I got hash brown instead of apple fry with my delayed pancakes. 

The manager was receptive to our complaints and gave a discount at the end. A quick road lunch that took nearly two and a half hours do not recommend on a Sunday."}
{"text":"After a very depressing trip up to AZ from CA to watch my Packers have arguably the worst game of their lives, my friends and I stopped here to eat before heading back to Los Angeles (6 hr drive). I had seen people pin recipes from here on Pinterest so I was always curious. 

The low down is this is good ol home country cookin. 2 of my friends went with the country fried steak and my boo went with the chicken \"dumplins\". I went for the Sunday special, home style chicken. Biscuits come with everything and I think everything came with 2 sides. My chicken was so good, 2 fried, juicy breasts. Then breading was amazing. It's too bad the dish I ordered wasn't a normal menu item and only a once a week item. Anyway, I got mashed potatoes and mac n cheese for my sides. The mac was soooo good, potatoes were just ok. Everyone enjoyed their food.  We were all so stuffed (portions were great) but we all were bummed to not be able to try the Coca Cola cake (just a really delicious chocolate cake), so we decided to split between the 4 of us. I was so good, hot and goey. This place isn't anything fancy but it is delicious comfort food for sure. Glad I got to try it, pretty sure there aren't any remotely close to LA."}
{"text":"Food is good and the store is always fun but I wish they didn't always have a wait. Make sure you try the apples and hash brown casserole, by far the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"Service was great here
The breakfast menu is a bit busy but I like how it tells you what you are getting 
Most of the breakfast options are big
I am not a big fan of the grits but the biscuits and gravy is good
The gravy is really yummy 
The eggs and sausage/bacon are both good as well

If I am in the area I would stop in for breakfast"}
{"text":"Love the old school favorites, grits, pinto beans, fried apples and chocolate cola cake!"}
{"text":"What a soul-crushing experience is Cracker Barrel. There is no more miserable experience than eating breakfast at this dump.

Still, Brak and I go here with Bob the Programmer for breakfast after a round of golf because it's close to the course. There really isn't any other reason to visit.

On our last visit, we had a horrible time getting the attention of our waiter. Our drink glasses were bone dry, and we couldn't flag anyone down to fill them. We did catch the attention of the 3 year old at the next table, which is the last thing I want -- I prefer my peace. As is typical at Cracker Barrel, every meal was served on about three plates, so we quickly ran out of table space and had to navigate and consolidate in order to maneuver.

On our previous visit, our waitress stank. Not a working-so-hard-that-she's-getting-a-little-sweaty stink, but a I-can't-believe-she-hasn't-been-fired stench. Every time she approached our table, we held our breath and talked about leaving. Seriously appalling. (Note that we did come back -- I don't know why either.)

The food is mediocre at best. Everything is bland and white, though I discovered that a nice yogurt and fruit parfait. I can't even imagine what anyone would order for lunch or dinner.

I don't have much to say that's good about Cracker Barrel, but I'll try. It has a big parking lot. There are at least 20 paths from the restaurant to do front door, so if you can get past the hostess station, you can always navigate around the gummers and the kids. It is also highly air conditioned, which feels divine after a round of golf when it's 106 in the shade....that'll boil your brain a bit and make Cracker Barrel seem like a good idea."}
{"text":"Just came here for dinner for the first time and I must say not bad! I had the sirloin and mashed potatoes with a salad and everything was great! There wasn't too many people here either which was nice. Not only would I recommend CB for breakfast but hey also do well for dinner also. I will definitely come back again for both."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Cracker Barrel (and I have been to several) with such horrid service. Waited 7 minutes just to have wait staff greet us and get a drink order. Then it took over 24 minutes (with no one stopping to check on us or anything) to get our cold food. 
Do not waste your time or money stopping here. This particular location is a disgrace to the Cracker Barrel name."}
{"text":"Been here many times and was excited to finally bring my family when I was in town. It seems when ever you're trying to impress someone it never works out. Waitress (Nic) was irritated with my wife as my wife changed her mind a few times while ordering. Then here's the biggest one the plate we got to eat our complimentary biscuits on appeared to have BLOOD on it. I got up and went to find a manager and he (older bald man) said ohhh no it's not blood and took it back and brought another plate.  No apologies no \"hey how can we make this right?\" 

Sadly I'm done here at this location."}
{"text":"We were traveling to NY.  Had two grand children with us.  The wait was extremely long for a Crackerbarrel.  Staff nice.  Good good as expected.  It slowed our trip and hope next one easier and faster."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool inside the, employees are very friendly and the customer service is good due to them just opening. However, the food was not good at all, I ordered the chicken fried steak, it came with biscuits and gravy and very small side of hash brown. Not enough gravy, the biscuits were not good, and the chicken fried steak was previously frozen and just dropped in the deep fryer. Nothing homemade. Very disappointed. My chick ordered a bacon burger.. The fries were soft and soggy, the patty flat and dry, the only thing that was decent was the bacon. I convinced myself that this place has to have something good about it, so I ordered a chicken pot pie to go, as I'm eating right now, it's just not good.. Kinda sad because the build up for this place was exciting and the food is basically truck stop food.. Definitely not worth the hour wait."}
{"text":"Solid.  I can't remembered what we ordered...but it was good.  We had a party of four and we sampled everything.  It was all good.  The items are all run of the mill items you can get anywhere but they were all cooked well and fresh.  Pancakes, chicken fried steak, etc..

Great service, reasonable prices, good food.  Give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Went to check out this comfort food establishment. It was great.  No waiting for a table.  The food was healthy portions and dinner for 2 with beverages included Around 30 bucks.  I had the chicken and dumplings but the best was the Mac n cheese as one of my sides. You get to choose 3 sides. Next time I'm just ordering my Mac n Cheese. The lemonade was refreshing and a nice change from carbonated drinks.  Madeline was our waitress she was busy, but must have come by around 3 times to check on us.  Bringing refills before we were emptied.    The country general store at Cracker Barrel offered a variety of items to purchase that won't break the bank.  It was decorated and organized ."}
{"text":"My wife and I responded to all the hype and checked it out around August 1st. I am a \"Texas redneck\" and shes Filipina. The place was a ZOO, one hour wait. We killed that one hour wait at BASS PRO buying a CCW pistol. We were seated around noon 30, the wife ordered the chicken n dumplings and I ordered the biscuits n gravy. The service was good considering the crowd but the food was only \"mediocre\". Not any better than what you can get at any local casino coffee shop.  This visit was the first, last and ONLY time I will ever visit the place. Bottom line, too long a wait and too much hassle for just mediocre food."}
{"text":"Simple =  home cooked country food and well yes, thank you.

Wow, my first time and well, I is very glad that I got to go to a place like this, the food was good and the CS, well, the was just top of the line; they have so must to offer you, thay you will be sure happy you came and had a time of your life.

For their is area where you can play game before your food gets there and well maybe even shop for a bit, as they have some great stuff to bye and well, they all would make great gifts; they even have rocking chairs that they make themselves.

From the food to the shop, all the way outside, you will be able to find some way, some how and well, the Crackle Barrel way is a mighty nice 1one; as I will be going back and well, this is a place to get home cooking, family time and well, yes, a place you will be able to make some good memories with the family, friends or even a date that will be the first of many to come."}
{"text":"They were out of biscuits of all things. I was finished eating by the time they were ready. The waitress was attentive enough."}
{"text":"Never unimpressed always the best!! Service and food!! I have never had a bad experience here it's always busy but not bad when you have everything country to look at and pass the time!!"}
{"text":"2 stars is for the iced tea.  It is very rare anymore to find brewed iced tea that is so good.  This is why I was drinking them so quickly.  While waiting for our food, the manager who was walking around saw that our drinks were empty and said he would refill them for us.  Great, because that iced tea is so good. Instead of refilling the glass I already have like the waitress had been doing, he brought me a fresh glass with a tea spoon in it.  I put sweet n low in my tea, so I pulled the glass over to put the sugar in and saw a white chunk in my drink.  I grabbed the spoon to pull it up and low and behold the spoon to had what looked like butter all over the handle and the spoon area.  It was either a dirty spoon off someones plate or a spoon that had been used to scoop butter.  I almost barfed. 

The waitress came over and I told her, she said \" I will get you another one. \"  No, I am sorry, no, I will let the manager know, nothing.\"  The manager walked by again and didn't say a word, I am assuming she did not tell him. 

I ordered the special of the day, the fish and it was gross. Not good, not good, not good.  I had to drown it in malt vinegar to eat it.  We already knew before we even walked in the place we were going to be ordering the coca cola chocolate cake.  While eating ( and after the tea incident) the waitress brought our check. She did not ask if we wanted dessert.  I spoke up and said we did, and she said \"OK, I will fix the check.\" 

This place is a joke.  That iced tea should have been free, and you definitely should not have rushed us to leave (party of 2 on an empty night) just because you screwed up.  

We asked for 2 boxes to go for our food we could not finish (for the dog when we got home)  and we were never offered a bag.  Okay, I thought, when we go to the gift shop to pay, we can get one.  Go to the gift shop, one cashier and 2 tourists asking a million questions and wanting to see everything.  After about 7 minutes another cashier came and rapidly rung up my check, and was so rushed I didn't ask about a canister on a top shelf above her that I was interested in purchasing, because I knew she didn't want to be bothered.  Oh, and guess what she still didn't ask if I wanted a bag, and didn't give me a chance to ask her for one, just rang up the check and then was gone to seat guests.  

I am so disappointed. We loved Cracker Barrel in Yuma and hoped this would be just as good.  Take a look at my cake pic, I didn't even get a full scoop of ice cream, but a half one."}
{"text":"The food is served cold and even if it is warm it's AWFUL and over salted. Long waits, slow service and food is sub par. Servers will come to your table once maybe twice after they take the order. Drinks never refilled. Food is just bland no flavor at all. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times already and also to a different location as well. I have to say Its always a pleasant visit. The food is always delicious I'm in love with their french toast and also the bacon. It really does make me feel like I'm having breakfast at home. It doesn't feel to much like a restaurant visit. Hands down I chose them always first before any other breakfast place. My top favorite place to go to."}
{"text":"I used to go to Cracker Barrel all the time when I lived in the northwest part of our country. I was so excited to see one open in Las Vegas! Just went there for the first time yesterday. We went on a Thursday at 4pm. Got there just in time, as it really started to fill up after we were seated. We sat at a table in the section when you first walked in. There were many other tables available, when 10 min later they seated a couple almost on top of us. There was not much room between our tables. They actually ended up asking to move tables. Although our food was fantastic, we had to wait an unusually long time to get it. Which seems even longer when you have children with you. The sweet tea was hardly sweet though. Great waitress."}
{"text":"First time eating at CB. Never again. Catfish was not fully cooked, it was raw in the middle. Coleslaw was blah.  Sweet tea, yeah right. What a waste of time and money. One of the wort places to eat. I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Cracker Barrel, but this particular branch does not do the chain justice.  I visited this Cracker Barrel two times and was treated with the same biased service. As an African American I try not to use the race card as it is a subject I choose to avoid, but for the first time I can say I felt as if my race played a factor in the horrible service I experienced at this location.  So for  that I say do not visit this location they have horrible service, and you will definitely notice the difference in treatment."}
{"text":"I'm a Cracker Barrel fan! I was excited to eat at the new location here in Las Vegas. Knowing it was new I figured there would be a wait. I called and \"Jeanette\" answered the phone. I asked about the wait time. She was having a conversation with someone else and the phone disconnected (hung up) with no answer to my question. I immediately called back and Jeanette answered again. I explained to her that I was hung up on and again began to ask about wait times. Before I could get the question out she snapped back that she did not hang up on me. Wow, I surly did not want to argue about it. Just wanted some chicken fried steak and eggs. Her attitude was terrible so I asked to speak to a manager. She sarcastically said \"Sure hold one moment please.\" After two minutes the phone was picked up and hung up. I called back twice after and the line was busy... Finally the third time a female who seemed to be disguising her voice answered. I asked for a manager and was put on hold for four minutes at which point I said screw it. I'll spend my money elsewhere... This is Las Vegas the home of hospitality. Cracker Barrel you failed..."}
{"text":"Good food, great music, and a peaceful environment.

I work a stressful job and sometimes I just want me some steak and eggs. I want that cow straight from the farmland and onto my plate. If it's still mooning, even better. People give me the side eye while I bathe in its blood but hey, it's what I want!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4x since the opening.  Never had a wait for breakfast always sat down immediately. Breakfast sampler great, uncle hers chef's favorite excellent. Always brought out piping hot. I do recommend going before 8a if you're an early bird.  I've left at 830am after eating and the patio was full of waiting customers.
I do suggest dinner later like after 6p on a Sunday. I went today at 430p table for 1 still waited 45 minutes and felt bad that they sat me at a table for 4.  Seems to be packed with visitors leaving town and North towners coming for dinner.  If you do live on the North FYI another cracker barrel is opening in October off Craig near the in and out burger. In all my fried chicken livers were well seasoned a little hard but crispy, turnip greens good, Mac and cheese a little bland. Waited 30 minutes for my dinner, but the server was great and and Kathy in the country store was a delight to talk to ask we shared stories of Berry picking and farmers markets while I waited for my table. I'll still come back just not for Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"I've severely underestimated this place for years. My first visit to Cracker Barrel was in Georgia for breakfast and the food ( what I ordered) wasn't the greatest. However, this is my second visit, and boy has my perspective changed. 
 Jason was our server and I loved how knowledgeable he was about the menu. I was weary about ordering the cinnamon streusel French toast and he assured me I wouldn't regret my decision. He was absolutely right. That was the best French toast I have ever had.  It was absolutely decadent every bite had just the right amount of cinnamon and cream cheese no syrup was needed. You couldn't ask for a better breakfast dish! Sadly it's seasonal, which is the only downfall."}
{"text":"The floor underneath our table was a mess. I ordered French dip,  no one told me there was no juice for dipping until after I had already received my food. There wasn't any edible meat on my sandwich, it was all fat. My salad consisted of 4 pieces of lettuce and 1 small tomato. Hands down, the worst meal I've ever had. I won't be back"}
{"text":"We bring our girls here when we want some down home food. They love their soups when they are feeling under the weather. I have always liked the store they have with the nastalgic candies and clothing for little ones. The rocking chairs they make are sturdy and adorable."}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel a few times before, and always enjoyed it. The food reminds me of stuff my mom, aunts, and grandmothers cook and the service is good.

Last night I went with my girlfriend and our food came out really fast, which was great. But it was warm at best. My mashed potatoes were pretty much cold, with warm spots. My chicken n dumplings were mostly warm, with some cold spots. My fried apples were cold. The mac n cheese was slightly above room temperature. Her meat loaf sandwich was prepared different then usual, had no gravy, and the bread was soggy. We were both starving so we ate what was brought, and I had planned on just letting the manager know. I even took my leftovers in a box. I wasn't looking for any sort of discount or anything, since we had come in late on a Sunday night and the food tasted great besides the temperature.

When I mentioned the issues to the manager, he immediately said they'd take care of our meal. I was shocked. I was actually offering to pay our bill, and he wouldn't let me.

Everyone has off days, and the manager went above and beyond to correct an issue that I wasn't even really that concerned about. Last nights visit won't stop me from coming back."}
{"text":"excited to see a new Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas as we have visited many of their restaurants on our travels...however we live in Ca and none exist there 
Wait time at 10 am on a Monday was 20 mins, store was usual fayre and to us at least the main dining area seemed smaller than most of the others we have tried.
Our server was Kassie and she was wonderful, friendly, efficient, attentive and ensured our food was cooked exactly as requested......eggs, well done turkey sausage, crispy bacon and of course perfect pancakes. 
Our drinks were refilled when required and all in all we had a perfect breakfast and intend to return tomorrow before we return to LA 
ps......also loved the warm biscuits and the warm syrup"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I LOVE Cracker Barrel, so it pains me to write this review...

I suppose I am just spoiled by the amazing Cracker Barrel chains in the South that I've experienced, but this place doesn't hold a candle.

I ordered breakfast, which was just alright. I ordered Cheesy Grits and they were terrible - under cooked, no flavor whatsoever, and just had cheese on top. Gross. 
The pancakes I ordered were no better. They were covered in oil... to the point where I could squeeze the pancake and have it drip oil. I abandoned them after a couple of bites.

The staff was super friendly, so plus one for that, but this is by far the worst experience I've had at this chain... ever.

I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 1/2  stars....wait time was good we only waited about 10 minutes during peek dinner time. Our waitress was nice but took a long time to come take our order. My biggest complaint is the food! It was yummy however it was served barely warm. The biscuits were amazing. MY COUNTRY FRIED STEAK, MAC N CHEESE, HASH BROWN CASSAROLE & CARROTS were barely warm, as of the had been sitting out for at least 15-20 minutes. My boyfriend ordered CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN, FRIES, MAC N CHEESE & CHEESE GRITS. His grits were cold & under cooked, Fries were old & cold and his food was barley warm too. The table next to us was complaing about cold food as well....I hope they can get their act together cause it's a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing. Been there twice so far. Great waitresses and great food. Reasonable prices. And the apple dumplings was so amazing omg"}
{"text":"Always love CB, the country ham is fantastic.  It's like crack."}
{"text":"How do I review Cracker Barrel?  Not sure what to say except the few times I've been here it's been a really good experience.

I love the old country feel to the place, with the rocking chairs out front, gift store in the front, and the decor once you get seated in the restaurant.  Service here has always been great, and our server on Saturday morning was funny, outgoing and made the experience worth while.

I went with the French toast as did my friend who joined me.  I went with coffee, and he stuck with water.  I love dining here, but I feel like everything on the menu is smothered in heart clogging pork gravy, and sometimes I find it hard to order since I don't eat pork.  Trying to get something without it seems impossible.  Yes, I can get substitutions, but what a huge pain it can be sometimes. I scour the menu for something that doesn't come with at least 3 variations of pork in the meal itself.

Overall, its a great place to grab a hearty breakfast, and I should try to come here more often.  Place is packed on weekend mornings, so if you want to beat the crowds, get here early!"}
{"text":"This was my first come trying Cracker Barrel and it was delicious.  Lisa our waitress was amazing,  very friendly and helped me navigate through the menu.  She did an excellent job"}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant, you can find many nostalgic and traditional things/foods here. Packed at meal time, we waited for about ten minutes. Old time breakfast was pretty good serverd with grits, eggs, crroselos, sausage, smashed potatoes and biscuits. Love the crroselos and grits. Friendly staff and comfy environment"}
{"text":"Food is alright.
Been here a few times and the wait staff is always pleasant.
Store is an adventure, even got stuff cheaper than on Amazon."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is our favorite restaurant to eat at when traveling and we chose this location as it was close to our hotel. We arrived around 5 PM on a Friday and the place was fairly empty. We were seated quickly and were asked if we would like a booster seat or high chair for our 2 year old, usually we have to end up asking ourselves if they have them available. Michael (I think that was his name) was our server and he was great! Our food was delicious and exactly what we ordered. Our server was friendly, attentive, and helpful. He definitely made us want to come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Food isn't terrible but not the best. The biscuits are good but they dont take care of there employees there for they dont take care of the customers and thats why i left this place as soon as i could. If i had stayed working in that kitchen i would have picked up the pissed off F**k the world attitude that so many have in there. They work you to death with no break and all they care about is getting the food out in 10 min or less from when you order not the quality at all. So glad this place is long ago in my pass though there is one cook that sports tattoos who actually gives a shit and he deserves a much higher paying and better cooking job."}
{"text":"Quite simple great service great food.
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal very affordable prices excellent customer service very attentive everything came out proper temperature great portion sizes we were satiated and it was good quality time"}
{"text":"Today I made a take out order was told my food would be 10 minutes so I hang up looked at the time it was 3:08pm were I stay is 5 minutes away so stopped at atm when I get there paid for my order cashier called on the intercom to inform them I was there to pick up my to-go order while I was waiting looking around in the store  I sat down didn't say nothing finally  received my to-go order looked at the time it was 4:06pm the cashier apologized for the wait I left so no business from me on to go food better off eat there I think"}
{"text":"Greg our server was AWESOME !!! Such friendly service && the store is so enjoyable to go through.. Good is great with great portion size!"}
{"text":"Dreadful.  I am giving it 3 stars because my husband loved the chicken fried steak & biscuits and gravy.  I found my breakfast to be cold, tasteless & disappointing.  Waited 25 minutes for this food too.  Employees are very nice but their food is definitely not as good as it once was & they built way too small a store for the traffic.

I would not go back & I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"OK OK this is 5 stars! Actually I have to give them 7 stars because I've ordered food to go from here twice already today being the last time. I must let everybody know the prices of Cracker Barrel the quality of food is phenomenal. I truly like everyone's attitude and trust me when I order breakfast (to go) I will order only from Cracker Barrel!!! EXTREMELY HAPPY!!!!!

This should be 5 stars! I understand this place would be crowded and the wait was only 15 or 16 minutes. (they can't help that) I don't think the person who sat us knew where the table was, we walked in a half circle lol. My chair had water in it ...I think someone wiped it out and didn't dry it. At first the waitress appeared to be a little distant. My wife & I asked if we could order now an she said yes, my wife placed her order and then I tried to place mine and quickly she said we're out of grits! So disappointed but she became very friendly. I'm so bad at this but when a table of 3 sits next to me 10 minutes later and there food arrives before ours \"just 2 of us\" it makes me wonder. And no we didn't order a steak! The silverware had bad water spots & the cup of hot water I ordered was forgotten so we couldn't eat until we wiped our silverware. Now our food needs to be reheated. In the meantime our country scrambled eggs were poured from a bag and egg whites were added to appear they were cracked. {I know someone reading this understands}

This may seem like a bad report trust me it's not! The manager came over and spoke to us. The African American cashier was extremely nice and funny. Over all they tried so hard. That's why I said it should be 5 stars! 

We will return but please have some grits!!! lol"}
{"text":"I ordered take out for two,during breakfast .(steak and eggs with gritts, biscuits,and gravy) I placed my biscuits on top off my gritts, put my eggs on top of my biscuits and poored my gravy over all of it. As I dove into my ' heart attack waiting to happen', I dicovered a very thick, black hair, aproximatley 3 inches in length. Needless to say , I didnt finish my meal."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come food always hot and tasty the catfish man hashbrown casserole leave happy all the time"}
{"text":"Well, I got that out of my system, once and for all. Not sure if I misremembered CB quality, or if quality has gone down that much in the ten years since I last ate at one. Either way, this cured me of ever wanting to eat here again.

The food reminded me of store-brand frozen dinners, like Banquet. Only that unnecessarily insults Banquet. The dumplings were anything but home-made, the chicken clearly not the real thing (tasted like the bags of frozen chicken cutlets you can buy at Target and Walmart where the labels advise that they've been injected with an 80% saline water solution, or something along those lines).

Fried okra had been fried long before. They were out of both honey for the biscuits and sweet potatoes. The cinnamon apples (identified as fried apples on the menu) were worse than mush.

And yes, the wait was long. The tables are crowded so close together you feel like you're at summer camp or in a high school cafeteria. Noise level is very unpleasant to the point of being stressful.

I won't be back. Especially since I literally just threw up while writing this review. When I sat down and realized how horrible the \"ambience\" was, I should've left."}
{"text":"I seriously can not believe what just happened at this \"restaurant\" we had a group of 8 people, and we have been sitting here for a hour and a half. Waiting for our food. We had enough time to watch 3 other tables sit down, order, eat and pay their bills. As we just say here. After we called the manager over and he offered to bring us biscuits? Like that's not the point. Where did our food go? What did they have to do? Go kill the chicken, skin it and then make my chicken and dumplings? I'm no wizard, but I'm pretty sure that it's already prepared in the morning. Then once we did get our food, it was cold with completely the wrong sides. All the waitress lady could do and say was... thank you I hope you enjoyed the meal and your time with us."}
{"text":"Wish we had some of these places in California!

Visiting some family and ate at this Cracker Barrel on the way to Greenville from Charlotte.  Being from California, I wanted to try Cracker Barrel because I heard the food was great for what you got.

Portions were a good size and very hearty. Ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with white gravy and mashed potatoes.  Had a side of macaroni and cheese, and cole slaw.  Wife had catfish with lima beans and carrots for the side.  

It was great!  Good value for the money.

Great concept with a general store in the entrance that you had to pass through to get to the restaurant.  Nice rocking chairs out front for people to buy or just sit down on. 

I would have given this place 5 stars but we had to ask for our utensils and napkins WHILE the food was being served.  Those things should already be on the table or be placed once customers are seated."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than the Cracker Barrel. I'm there for hours at a time. Eating and shopping. I live in California and I always take a few pounds of coffee gone with me. Seriously the best coffee. Make sure and check out the clearance section. There is always some great stuff there."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Always fun to go to. This is in Phoenix.....I think that last one was a snowy Salt Lake City."}
{"text":"First time here. The food is yummy. They have Really really friendly staff.  Especially Andrew! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Love their breakfast menu.  Huge portions.  Wish they have a restaurant in California.  Really enjoyed the ambiance.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"It's Cracker Barrel but the one off of Dobson and the 202 has a server, Reggie, that is awesome!!  He loves his job and he is a foodie!  Great job!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't very good at all. I had the chicken n dumplins and they were cold. Corn bread was blah. Beans were gross. No ketchup despite ordering it with chicken tenders for my daughter. Wife had to remind server of her order when they brought out my and my daughter's food. 

No drink refills. Check came out super fast and we felt rushed.

Very disappointing. Way too much hype at this place."}
{"text":"Well I'm dropping them two stars.  I had hoped that they'd get the bugs worked out, but that hasn't happened.  I went there today for a late lunch (weekday, 1:45PM).  There was no line so I had no wait.  Got to my table pretty quickly and put in my order relatively fast.  It seemed to take a bit longer than expected to get my food.  When it did arrive the girl forgot to bring out my biscuits.  I asked her to go get them for me.  Then she entered a wormhole and I didn't see her for quite some time. I finally was able to flag down another waitress and she brought out my bread (I was done with most of my meal by then).  A few minutes later the wormhole spit out the original waitress who low and behold had my bread.  Her statement \"Oh, you got your bread already.\"  Yeah, no thanks to you.  

I told the folks there to read their Yelp reviews.  This is the second-worst Cracker Barrel I've ever been to (the worst was Massachusetts, near the border with Connecticut).  Not happy."}
{"text":"I have heard hype for some time about how great this place is.. Well I finally took the time to wait in line for this. I went on a Monday mid morning and still had to wait 45 minutes when told it would be 15 min.

     The store style is very cozy to entertaining with all the stuff displayed throughout the store and restaurant. 

  I feel this place is still going through opening pains. Service started out ok but seemed to lack any enthusiasm. And we ended up having to ask for refills as they passed by follow up was very poor.

    The menu had alot of choices from lunch and breakfast menus. And prices seemed to be on track with other local restaurants. 9-15 dollars ..

    The food was a big let down.. I do not know what the rant is.. The food was very bland, 
portions where ok at best. the biscuits and corn bread where so dry not even butter and jam could spare them. I had meat loaf as part of my meal and it tasted like cheap hamburger meat with out anything else.. The chicken and dumplings where a big lump on the plate not at all like I know them to be.. had the consistency of mac and cheese which I also got which where gritty..  

      I'm very let down from this visit, I might give them another try in the future but right now I will stay away.. Over hyped for the value, wait is way to long for what you get and bland food.."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the Las Vegas Cracker Barrel is the first and only Cracker Barrel I have ever visited. That being said I have no other Cracker Barrel to compare it to but, have always heard rave reviews about the restaurant and food. 

My first visit was fabulous! The place was packed but the staff was efficient in turning tables and getting people in and out without feeling rushed. 
The food was good and service was great. Food and drinks were served promptly. The quality overall was better then your average popular breakfast chain. 

The only bummer is I have been back a handful of times and the restaurant/ kitchen itself is pretty inconsistent. I've gone a time or two and the food is great and another time or two and the food is sub par I've even been served cold, soggy food. 

One thing that is consistent is the service I have always enjoyed all the wait staff, they are friendly, accommodating and quick! I also always enjoy browsing their \"country store\" so many old timey candies, nic-nacs, cookware, toys, hats clothing... 

If the kitchen can be more consistent this place would sure be a home run. 
I will continue to try Cracker Barrel in hopes that it improves, I know it's a fairly new establishment and maybe they are just working out the kinks."}
{"text":"I moved to Urbana a year ago and now and moving away. We went for breakfast recently, June 13th I believe and we had the most incredible service. We always do but this time was special. The server was so kind to our children who were antsy waiting for their grandfather to arrive. Our server purchased three toys for our kids and helped calm them down. She also was so quick with the orders, accurate, quick to refill coffee, made sure we had boxes, and to go coffee. She overheard that my birthday had passed and she gave me a to go chocolate cake. The way she spoke to my children was so wonderful and they loved her. I am a cynical person but she really made me remember that not all people are bad. Thank you for the amazing experience that my kids still talk about."}
{"text":"Simple American food, fairly well done. Pleasing atmosphere and friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We have eaten here dozens of times because it's one of the few sit down restaurants available to us here in Buckeye.  I love their breakfasts and fried chicken. The only thing I do not enjoy is the fact that 1/2 the time if you come in towards closing time the food generally ends up cold...which kinda sucks.  
If you want some down home breakfast foods get it and love it!!!.  
The country store is adorable. I would love to buy 2/3rds of what is in that store but my house just will not accommodate that much cuteness!!"}
{"text":"A somewhat frustrating Cracker Barrel experience. My Mom's very hard sweet potato was replaced without question, but then she was surprised by a chunk of Jack's beanstalk in her green beans (see picture for comparison to normal-sized green bean). My oven-fried chicken breast was dry -- possibly a leftover from lunch (we arrived at 4pm). The check was delivered right after food was served, and the server nicely told us that there was no rush. Unfortunately, service by both waitresses (a second had delivered the food) all but ceased after the check was on the table. It took multiple attempts to get the attention of the servers, but they did eventually see our raised hands and refilled our coffee. Also, it took three requests to obtain two extra corn bread muffins. If a Cracker Barrel manager reads this, I would simply suggest that servers continue to pay attention to customers throughout the meal. No need to hover -- just use some common sense to check on us until we're out the door, please."}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law had not eaten at a Cracker Barrel in 10+ years so we were excited to stop here on the way back from the rodeo in Wickenburg. 

Shopping, family atmosphere, great food...  I was stoked.  I eat at CB regularly in the east valley so how was I to know this was going to be AWFUL?!

My brother-in-laws eggs were wrong, DH's ORDER was wrong, my egg sandwich wasn't cooked through at all, had no mayo (which is standard) and the mayo that was brought out tasted like lard, my sister's fries had NO flavor and my stepson's kid burger was burned to a crisp.  We got DH's order fixed but the rest wasn't worth complaining about.  Drinks sat empty, apologies were made for the cooking time (we sat a LONG time with no food while maintaining good spirits).

I will never go to this location again and it's safe to say that my sister and bro-in-law will probably never eat at a CB again.  Way to go!!"}
{"text":"Tonight my husband and i had Bonnie as our waitress and she was awesome! Kept our glasses full of soda and the food was great and hot! We always enjoy eating here and most of the staff knows is because we are here all the time! This will be forever my favorite place to eat. It has great down home country good with excellent service with smiling faces! People that actually like their job! Its refreshing to see! We will come here forever!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, we see the commercials all the time in Los Angeles which is silly because there are no Cracker Barrel restaurants/stores in all of California. So when planning our trip to Phoenix I decided to look and see if there was a Cracker Barrel anywhere near the resort. Awesome there was one just one exit up on the 10 freeway. The anticipation was high as we pulled in and saw the rows of rocking chairs for sale in front then once inside the smell of cinnamon candles was overwhelming. The novelty of this place in unbelievable. With Moon pies and jumbo size candy bars and soda and coffee and bake mix and I could go on, but my review is really for the restaurant.  I ordered the Chicken and Dumplins no \"g\" in dumplins cuz were tryin to be authentic here. for my sides I ordered the Fried apples and steak fries. Okay the dumplins are not like my mommas these are the noodle flat kind of dumplins but they also had no flavor. I had to douse them with salt and pepper to get flavor into them. The fried apples were the best part of the meal. Also you get your choice of bread, I love corn bread so I picked that. My wife picked the buttermilk biscuit. I should have taken the Buttermilk Biscuit. Maybe my taste buds took a vacation but the cornbread had no flavor at all, She ordered the grilled chicken tenders mashed potatoes and Fries. She said all of her food was good, she asked me if I wanted to try them but I told her it might mess up my review of the restaurant.  So for novelty, I give it a five, for my food I give it a two for my wife's food I give it a four so overall average is three."}
{"text":"So I've been here now three times but today I finally hit the lotto and got Zachary as a server .. the past two times coming here I had such a bad time but today is my Moms 60th bday and she wanted a taste of home for breakfast and .. Growing up Cracker Barrel was our family road trip go to (thanks grandpa) anyway I know the standard and signature experienced of the south this place should have and let me tell you Zach pulled it out and I recommended you ask for him if you make your way here . He rocks and made sure we had our cocoa n waters too plus got my mom a bday dessert... Sundays special the chicken is soooo freaking good and I love the food lol I never have room for dessert but we got it due to my moms bday and the chocolate fudge cola Coke is so good ... anyway I am impressed how management stepped up their game and I will be back again and I'm sure as long as I ask for Zach I'll get this to a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"Where to start? For some reason i thought this place was good a long time ago.... idk if the food just went down hill or this location is just terrible.... first we waited about 30mins for a table, thinking we would have good food and service! NOT the case food was horrible... biscuits were dry, gravy had NO flavor... to actually call these biscuits is a disgrace.. everything on my plate was bad.... the potato casserole had no flavor.. ham tasted like it's been sitting under a heat lamp for 3 days... i was shocked that my food was so bad. Service was just as bad.. i would honestly go Denny's or IHOP before i would ever go back here.."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Most recently had salmon patties for dinner, which may be a new menu item. I've eaten with others who seemed quite happy with their meals as well. Service was good. We went on a Friday night and it was somewhat hectic, and service was slow, because they were so busy. My party decided it was a good idea to avoid Friday nights as it was so busy. Prices are reasonable. I would eat here again. Another in my party had their meat loaf and thought it was quite good. They bring a platter of bread to the table, a variety of muffins, biscuits, which are quite good too. I have found this to be a reliable place for a good meal. It is a good place for a family dinner, nothing fancy, but good food and good size portions."}
{"text":"Terrible,  venimos a Lunch y todo estaba quemado,  pañales,  cheeseburguers,  bacon,  un sándwich de pollo,  el pollo quemado y el pan también...  Pensé que estaría rico pero Nel, valiomaiz"}
{"text":"I am overall very impressed with the Cracker Barrel brand, but what makes any one location better than another is the service.  We've never had bad service here, and I've been here more times than my check-ins would indicate.  The breakfast is as good as most higher priced places.  The only set-back is how crowded it gets, but that's just part of going to Cracker Barrel.  Everyone loves it.  Their servers are usually top notch.  I've got nothing bad to say about this location."}
{"text":"Very slow to get food to the table after a 45 minute wait. Got here at 530pm which you would think is early for dinner.  Finally got food to the table at 715pm. 
PS they DON'T SERVE BEER or alcohol. Might be the only restaurant in Las Vegas without alcohol. Not coming back."}
{"text":"First time here, my server was nice and professional. The food came out fairly quickly. The food was above average, the only thing that I didn't like was that before I was able to take the first bite, my server had already gave me my bill! 

I felt as though I was being rushed to make way for another customer. I was told \"No rush\"....yet  I had my bill before my first taste of the meal. I'm not sure if I'll be back, I wasn't too impressed."}
{"text":"My first experience eating at a Cracker Barrel was this last trip to Arizona. Coming to Arizona for the past nine years for Spring Training baseball. I am familiar with the billboard signs advertising this home style country themed restaurant. I have always been curious and wanted to eat at one before but for some reason or the other never did until recently. When I joined some good friends who moved out to Goodyear just last year. 
With a large parking lot. Finding parking is no problem at the restaurant. The restaurant building itself reminds me a very large general store you would see in a Western movie. Rocking chairs can be seen lined up in front of the building. From the looks of it. The rocking chairs were for purchase if you were in the market for one.
Once inside, you are greeted by a store full of knick knacks, home decor, souvenirs, antiques, toys. All kinds of stuff. So before and/ or after your meal you can shop like crazy. In my opinion, this for the ladies and kids. Being a guy. I just would want to eat and leave. But I can see bringing the wife and being there for awhile. A long while. Men be warned.
As far as the dining. The food is great. Chicken fried steak, fried chicken, chicken and dumplings and meatloaf are among some of the dinner selections. All of them are good choices. Nothing I saw or had; looked or tasted bad. They even bring warm corn bread and buttermilk biscuits to your table with your dinner. 
One thing though and it's a biggie. No alcohol. They don't serve it. First, I thought they had a separate drink menu but no. No alcohol. I love washing down a real good meal with a beer or two. Instead I had a lemonade and imagined vodka was in it. I kid.
Overall, a good meal. The food really is good. I can care less about the shopping. The \"No Alcohol\" I can live with. It was just a surprise not knowing that going in. The service was good. Parking not a problem. Very affordable family dining. Definitely will come back. Eat here."}
{"text":"Although I'm really not that much of a breakfast person, I was surprisingly impressed with the quality, service and overall vibe of this place. 

It is fully decked out like an old-fashioned, southern-country joint and based on the large crowd it is definitely a hotspot to hit up for breakfast on the weekends. One of the only reasons I deducted a star is because although the wait staff was friendly, they were a bit \"pushy\" and really wanted to get our order in. I mean, I can understand that you're busy, but when I just sit down and haven't even opened the menu yet, it probably wouldn't be polite to ask me \"So have we decided yet?\"

I ordered a traditional breakfast (Mama's Big Breakfast I think) with scrambled eggs (and cheese), really thick bacon (my favorite kind) and pecan pancakes (AMAZINGLY GOOD). My friends pretty much ordered the same thing, so I'm not sure how the rest of the menu is, but I was happy with my food. I really want to try what they have for lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love that you are allowed to order from the kids meal and be ANY age! The servers are kind no matter how busy they get, and everything I've eaten here has always tasted good."}
{"text":"So the first time I ever visited a cracker barrel was a pretty poor experience. I was expecting delicious down south cooking but it more of a spin off of eat n park style dining. I was very upset and said I'd never go back.  Well I ended up here at the one in Robinson after a family member convinced me to give it another try.

So we ordered biscuits and jelly, strawberry lemonades, pancake breakfast with cheesy grits, hash brown casserole an eggs over easy. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Maybe because I just came back form the caribbean where the food was just OK, but this meal was great indeed. Everything was served hot and fresh. My pancakes were nice and fluffy, buttery and came topped with strawberry. I've never had the casserole before but it was decent as well. The biscuits were definitely a hit, especially with jam! YUM!!!

One of my favorite aspects of cracker barrel is their gift shop when you first walk in. So many hand crafted and homey furnishings that it almost makes you feel like your out of town. I will definitely try this location against I'll make sure I'm on an empty stomach first!"}
{"text":"Here's a challenge for you: try being a vegetarian and go to eat at Cracker Barrel.

Vegetable plate my buttinsky--there's pork in that there dish.  Yep, my wife ordered their plate with four vegetables and two of them were loaded with pork.  Look, I'm not dogmatic about vegetarianism--if you want meat, go for it (it's tasty), but if you are offering a veggie plate at your restaurant, at least mention somewhere in the menu that it's mixed with pig meat. . .

About the best you can do at a place like Cracker Barrel (if you want to do more than graze on salad) is to resort to Starchitarianism.  In that case, either order sides or get something like their French Toast plate with the meat on the side to take home to the dog.  It's really good tasting and will fill you up for a nice price.

Otherwise, this Cracker Barrel is a great place to eat--just not really for us.  If you're not veggie, there's gonna be tons of great food here for you."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent!!! Prices were decent. My boyfriend got the country fried steak, he says it wasn't what it used to be, the breading used to be what they put on the Fried chicken now. It was like a frozen patty this time. He also had the Mac and cheese, green salad and fried apples. He enjoyed them all. I had the country fried chicken which was their Sunday deal. It was amazing!!! I also had the Mac and cheese, which could have used more cheesy flavor. It was a white cheese and kind of runny. I also had the turnip greens which too, were disappointing. It had a frozen flavor to it. The  biscuits were Delicious- super fresh, moist and fluffy! The corn bread was a little dry but tasted good. The sweet tea was very good, my boyfriend drank like 5 glasses. I had unsweetened tea which was just like any other unsweetened tea...
The service is worth mentioning again, Jill was great and extremely helpful and knowledgable of the menu. We may return if we travel through the area again."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel I love you.
Anytime I'm wanting a good home style breakfast or even a good ol' country dinner this is my go to. 
Walking into Cracker Barrel the vibe is automatically country style. They have the awesome racking chairs to sit while you wait or sit and play a good game of checkers after you eat. Inside they have a shop with a variety of themes. Every holiday they have a display for Christmas or Halloween etc. if you ever wanted to relive your child hood they have toys and candies from different years. 

The food, The prices are set so perfectly to each plate of your choosing you can never go wrong with any plate your order."}
{"text":"Isn't it nice when people write things about which they have zero knowledge whatsoever?  Oh, it's true there was a horrible and senseless (aren't they all?) killing there yesterday, but avoiding this place because of it would be like avoiding driving on 480 because (many more than 3) people have died on it. Now I expect he'll write, \"can't you take a joke??\" About murders that happened yesterday? No, I can't. 

If you're going to avoid it do it for a good reason: The food is mediocre at best. There are so many better breakfast places, but if you need to be by 480 in Brooklyn, I guess it will do."}
{"text":"We had a gift certificate for Crackle Barrel and so we decided to try this place. I walked in and confusion. It's a real country store with a bunch of old stuff hanging down from the ceiling. Looking for where to go then as you look at the back of the store and you see the hostess stand. Thank goodness. 

The place is packed and it's like a very homey country place with lots of old country pictures and plaques. I got the menu and again confusion. Huge menu for lunch and dinner with another menu for breakfast (they serve breakfast all day). So going through both menus is tough. 

I started out with their raspberry lemonade in a frosted mug. Really good, fresh and I loved it. I had the fried catfish with Mac & cheese, fried okra, and hash browns. Oh yea forgot to tell you, you get to pick three sides with your meal. The catfish was ok. A little dry. The mac & cheese was ok. Not great. Okra was a little moist. Not crispy like it should be and the hash browns were ok. Not a great meal but ok. Also, they bring out muffins and cornbread muffins. I've had better cornbread. Not great. So I would say my meal was just ok. 

My wife had the apple cider vinegar BBQ chicken. She loved it. It was very moist and the sauce was excellent. She was talking about it in the car. Haven't heard her talk about a meal like that before. I grabbed a little bit and it was very good. Loved the sauce. My son had the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good. No complaining from him. 

The service was good. It took awhile for our server to greet us but understandable because the place was so busy. She did get our drinks and refilled us when we needed it. She was pretty good and friendly. 

So the place is loud with people eating and enjoying themselves. Lots of families. There was music playing but I think it was. some country music. The food was okay to really good. I guess I just ordered the wrong thing. I did notice everyone ordering breakfast and the blueberry pancakes and French toast looked really good. So next time it's breakfast. Service was good and a real family atmosphere. Like I said I will probably be back but order from the breakfast menu. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Yuck. 
Slow service. Over priced. Ordered eggs over medium, got a runny mess. 

$10.45 for sausage and eggs. 

No thank you."}
{"text":"Officially can scratch Cracker Barrel off my list. Honestly, it's Denny's or Shari's with a theme. Below average food, average pricing, relatively safe. I got the French toast with sausage and hard boiled eggs, husband got some platter that consisted of eggs, bacon, biscuits, gravy, and grits. The gravy and grits are super bland, and it's all just kind of passable. Service was fine though and everyone we experienced while there was friendly."}
{"text":"I had a phenomenal experience at this location thanks to my server Michael P. He was incredible. He was a Rising Star but you wouldn't even have known if it wasn't for his apron. He was very attentive and patient, answered all of our answers with a smile, and was very kind. I will most certainly request him next time I go. 

We got the Sunrise sampler and the Mamas pancake breakfast. The food was delicious, and the biscuits were actually HOT. Which was amazing. Just as a suggestion, as for a scoop of butter, it's much easier to spread on your biscuits than the butter packets. 

I took one star away from my review because of the hostess. We were greeted with a muffled \"Hi\" as she walked away with menus, it wasn't until she turn and waved at us that we realized we were supposed to follow her."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant for country cooking.  

It's hard to decide what to get from the breakfast all day to the dinner menu.  

Never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"Food here is tasty and served quickly from friendly wait staff. The menu is generally country style with plenty of items to satisfy most palettes. The attached country store had a selection of unusual goods for ok prices."}
{"text":"Great country food on a dime... great southern sides, beans, greens and the rest. It's just a nice homey place to have a meal any time of day."}
{"text":"Heavy southern food with delicious biscuits and mouthwatering homemade jam. Enough said."}
{"text":"I  Cracker  Barrel!  The Buttermilk Oven fried chicken is so good!  Sometimes they run out of it though which is a bummer.   The catfish is awesome too.   Cracker Barrel is one of the best places for fried okra.   It's hard to find elsewhere.   I can't finish this review without mentioning or favorite waiter,  Cody.   He is so attentive, super nice and friendly.   He also remembers what we like to order.   Thx for a great dinner tonight !"}
{"text":"Excited to try this place, didn't mind the 40 min wait figured it should be worth the wait....had the Steak & eggs, comes with fried apples, biscuits n nasty gravy with a hint of smokey salmon flavor weird, julienne dinner potatoes with cheese and watery grits..."}
{"text":"Heart attack platter, yes.  Delicious southern food, of course."}
{"text":"Ordered togo Allison always makes sure the order is perfect. I asked for xtra cheese sauce on wed special broccoli cheddar chicken. Only negative was very bland mashed potatoes with thin gravy."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our time here. Visited during the Labor Day holiday.... place was packed but food was delish. Can't wait for it to be built in Victorville. Guess it'll be the closest one for those of us living in the IE. 

This place brings back the good ol days of eating together as a family and eating good wholesome food. I miss these types of restaurants. It's great to be able to eat at a place like this, especially just off the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I just absolutely love this place. They have an extensive menu, their food is delicious, and it is enough to heartily fill any hungry tummy. More than that, the servers are always friendly, and our server definitely made her rounds anytime she saw any beverage was running low. GREAT customer service and very friendly wait staff.

I ordered the Southern Trout, and it was so delicious with warm corn and a very sweet potato. We were on our way to the airport, and this is one of the best pit stops that any group or individual can take before landing themselves at the airport back to the west coast. No doubt!

What's better too, is that there is the store right next to it with cute trinkets and little gifts. It's nice to take a look and a good little walk around to digest the meal you just had. I recommend the strawberry lemonade too. Very fresh!

Thanks for a great experience. Can't wait to be back there!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and the food had no flavor was like it sat under the heat lamp too long"}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was lacking. At least the manager came around to check on customers. The server didn't even give us a chance to order dessert as she gave us the check right after putting our meals on the table. Live and learn experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"On my drives to Pittsburgh, I always pass their stores on the highway. I was in the area so I decided to get lunch here with my friend. She highly recommended it to me, telling me it was Southern comfort food. I am always game for Southern food so I agreed. The inside of the store surprised and overwhelmed in the sensed that I didn't expect that there would be merchandise being sold and a restaurant attached to it. The hostess took our name and while we were waiting, played a game of checkers outside which was a fun way of wasting time. 

Food-wise, their selection is huge. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted but ended up getting the chicken dumplings. When the food arrived, it was enough to feed a whole family. I will applaud Cracker Barrel for giving a good portion of chicken to the amount of dumplings in the dish. I had been wary about having a 9:1 ratio of dumplings to chicken. The sides were also difficult to choose but I wanted \"lighter\" sides so I ordered hash brown casserole, steamed broccoli, and rice pilaf. I believe all of the dishes come with biscuits or corn muffins and I chose biscuits. The biscuits were not as flaky as I would have liked but there were still good. 

I definitely enjoyed the experience but the food overwhelmed me with its heaviness and large portions. You definitely get the most of your money but the food here is just not something I would come back for."}
{"text":"Why can't a business be consistent? Sometimes, you get good service and other times, not so great. 

This time the service was so disappointing and slow, I felt like walking out and going someplace else. When a place is slow, service seems to be slow too. The hostess was slow, the cashier was slow, everything was like slow-motion? I wasn't even in a hurry.

The server didn't pick-up the dirty plates. Yuck!

The prices were ok for the portion size.

Ambiance is cool, like an old general store with home style cooking. Their gift shop area is fun to browse, filled with candies, clothing, lotions, and other random gifts.

Why did I ever think their food was any good? I usually eat their breakfast, which is ok. Dinner was chain restaurant quality, duh! I wished I had gone to a local eatery instead. No more Cracker Barrel for me."}
{"text":"Online pick up was not impressive at this location. My order was not ready in the time window I was given. There was no special parking space at this location. The other CB is better for take out online pick up. 

This one is not that great. Parking is not always plentiful. Gift shop is too crowded and overwhelming to walk thru."}
{"text":"Everytime I visit the AZ I always stop here for breakfast on my last day. I've ordered almost everything on the menu. It's really home cooking country food. Please order a milkshake when your done with breakfast, it always hit's the spot. As for lunch and dinner I couldn't tell you anything really. I only eat breakfast there.make sure you visit the store before you go, you'll end up buying something unique. Peace."}
{"text":"Fast prompt service...food came out fast and cooked to order...hot and very tasty...will visit again"}
{"text":"We don't go to cracker barrel that often and I was reminded on this visit of why we don't. Most of the food tasted good, quantity was small for the price, and appearance was awful.  I had the French dip meal,   I don't think the cooks look at the pictures on the menu, meat was over cooked and some was burnt. after pulling the burnt off the sandwich it was small. it did taste good after dipping it in the au jus. The fry's it came with were cold and heat lamped looking. not worth the $8.99   Our server Esilda went thru the motions but was not exceptional.  it was not supper busy when we went, and had to ask our server for drink refills, she never asked how our meal was (kind of like she knew our food was sub-standard) .  I sure wish they did a better job over all have all ways enjoyed cracker barrel in the past"}
{"text":"There was an unusually long wait at the CB this AM. They quoted a 15 minute wait and it was closer to 20 min. By the time we were seated we already knew what we wanted so we were able to order as we placed our drink orders. The service was off but the food was good. We were switched servers after placing our order. There was some confusion but it all got worked out."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. All the hype - none of the brand we all know and remember. Yes, it brought me back to WISCONSIN - for a minute. But it was NOT the Cracker Barrel from back home. 
Long wait. Slow service. Dry, tasteless food and burnt coffee. They may survive on the tourists who make a one-stop deal and complain silently but don't return. Locals will get their one-time newbie fix and move on - my prediction. ."}
{"text":"Awesome rocking chairs and delicious pancakes! This pretty much sums up my opinion of Cracker Barrel.

There are two Cracker Barrel restaurants serving Nevada and I am so excited about this! I had no idea until I was looking for an In N Out away from the Strip. En route to the burger joint....low and behold....we discover Cracker Barrel right next door located in North Las Vegas. So, I immediately changed plans for breakfast the next day! 

I was first introduced to Cracker Barrel by conversation from friends who were originally from Florida and Georgia. While we have IHOP and Denny's on the West Coast, they have Cracker Barrel on the East. But, they are oh so different from each other!

My first dining experience at Cracker Barrel was when I was in Millington, TN for five days. It was at the top of my list, so we had our first breakfast there. At that time, they were offering Blackberry Pancakes as a seasonal menu item. Pancakes plus a side of scrambled eggs, bacon, and a cup of coffee made my day. My meal was excellent! The pancakes are amazeballs. Fluffy, buttery, a little crispy around the edges, and not so dense. Needless to say, we spent every morning at CB until it was time to head back to California.

Along the front porch of all CB restaurants are rows of beautiful wood rocking chairs. Very relaxing and convenient, especially if you need to wait for a table. You can even special-order one if you wanted! For approximately $160 you could take a solidly made, wood slat rocker home for your own porch or lanai!

Upon entering CB, there is always a Country Store filled with a plethora of items for sale such as board games, unique sodas and candy, clothing, jewelry, candles, soaps, greeting cards, stuffed animals, and good ole Cracker Barrel pancake mix and maple syrup (you'll want to take advantage of that).

Service is ALWAYS awesome! Southern hospitality and random acts of kindness. They pride themselves in pleasing people and have never fallen short no matter what location we've been to.

Breakfast is served all day, then there is the Lunch/Dinner menu. All are very good! You just can't go wrong with Cracker Barrel. The prices are right, too!"}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel feel nostalgic to me! I used to love going in Orlando. The service isn't always the best because it's always so busy but the food is always good I always get the sunrise sampler and a pancake. I'm never disappointed. I love the country store! The have cute clothes, jewelry, even home decor! Can't go wrong with my two favorite things Shopping and Eating! It is far for me so I wouldn't come back often but I will be back!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy dining at Cracker Barrel.   The food is always very good, as is the service.  The servers rarely make a  mistake. 

The menu is a very wide selection of comfort food, but there are plenty of things on the menu that are \"healthy\"."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is ALWAYS A WINNER!  The prices are quite reasonable, the food is always cooked properly  ...and served hot.  What more do you want?

While it appears they have a high turnover of servers,  which is common to the industry.

The difference with CB, however, is that new servers are well trained."}
{"text":"Nice brunch and decent portions! The country store is cute and had a lot of neat things."}
{"text":"The food was good but Dasia the server was horrible she took forever to get my daughter her tea and ranch dressing."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is pretty close to where I live but I only eat there every few years. The service is always good. The atmosphere is fine. The general store is nice to look around in. 

They are all about their \"home cooked\" style food, but the thing is, I'm always left with the strong awareness that I can make the same food at home, but better, and for a lot less money. Their food isn't bad by any means, but it's nothing extraordinary, either."}
{"text":"First time loved the variety of food
Great meatloaf 
Crackers are something to try
Store was fun to look around"}
{"text":"I have reviewed other cracker barrels' before & I sweared I will never be back again, but had to go since she had a gift card lol. After thinkin for hours and hours I finally decided to go with the veggie platter again with 4 vegetarian sides. I got Mac & cheese ofc, broccoli cheese casserole ( daily special ), poached egges and wait for it, hush puppies! (Check pic) Yes I made them get me hash puppies! Oh and I made it clear to the waitress 10 times to make sure there's no meat in any of my food today. (Check my review for other Cracker Barrel where they sprinkle bacon in everything despite my requests)

The broccoli casserole tasted more like broccoli & cheese and less like a casserole. Hush puppies were bland and over fried. We had an excellent waitress though for a change. Hopefully I can try something else next time, oh wait they don't have anything else that I can try! Compared to places like lo-los for example, I feel like cracker barrels meatless sides aren't good enough"}
{"text":"Loved the ambience and was really looking forward to this place, what after having loved lolo's I was really excited about another southern joint?! I havta say I am terribly disappointed with this place, not coming back here for food again

They darn sprinkle bacon on everything, especially when I told the waitress already that I am a vegetarian! Really insulting

The waitress could care less. When asked by one of the elderly women in our party about what is in the soup, she just said she didn't know and didnt even offer to go find out! Why be in service industry if you can't do the only thing you are supposed to do!? Ah well we tipped her $10 anyways, like I said as if she cares even if we didnt, just another day!"}
{"text":"I LOVE CRACKER BARREL but this location left me disappointed. The staff wasn't friendly, thet were really slow. It took 30 minutes to pay the bill the line was so long. The food was excellent as it always is. They need some tips from some other Cracker Barrel. Perhaps from a store in the south."}
{"text":"I'm normally not a Cracker Barrel person.  Not because I don't like the food but more-so because there is other breakfast close to me. But every now and then family or friends will suggest it for breakfast and I'll oblige.  

Outstanding customer service at this location. Super clean environment (including the restroom). We were waited on by Kevin initially. He was wonderful but then my Mom wanted to move closer to the fireplace (in her defense it was 25 degrees outside) and we ended up in Vicki's section who was the sweetest Southern woman you ever want to meet. She took great care of us and was even patient when I inadvertently forgot to put the word pecan before the word pancakes. ? 

Within 15 minutes my Mom, sister and I had our meals. Everything was piping hot and delicious with a made-from-scratch taste and ample portion. My sister devoured her pancakes and my mom finished most of her breakfast. I'm a big eater and I only made it through one of three pancakes and my turkey sausage and took my other two pancakes and eggs to go. 

On top of a great breakfast, we found some great deals in the old country store. I snagged an embroidered UNC Chapel Hill fleece half zip sweatshirt and a set of car coasters for less than $20 bucks. All-in-all a great experience. You won't be disappointed if you ask for Vicki or Kevin and shop the sales."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel and jump at the chance to grab some grub when I see it around especially their breakfast. I would totally 5 star this joint if it wasn't for the service we received on this visit. Just pretty forgetful and slow, which is funny because I remember our server serving us over four years ago and back then she was fantastic!  I think that most people have gone to a Cracker Barrel location at one point so I won't bore folks in this review by going over the bits I love. I'll just say that their biscuits are outrageously good, tea is always perfectly sweet and their breakfast is like mom's....All that goodness at a fraction of the cost for the portions you get. And I always love the knickknacks they have in their store and is a great spot for picking up some quirky gifts."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed going here. The atmosphere is great. But the food lacks in so many ways. Went to the north Las Vegas location for the first time after so many people recommended. The service was good for how busy it was. The pancakes are good. The rest of the food was flavorless. The eggs(scrambled) were under cooked. The sausage and bacon tasted old and no flavor. The grits were so watery it was hard to eat even with a spoon. Would recommend Danny's or ihop over cracker barrel. Only gets a 2 star because of the service."}
{"text":"Unique to me, more of a country type meals. Enjoyed the meatloaf and potatoe.
Nice feel to the place tohang out with friends."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. We came for breakfast today but had to leave due to an emergency before our food came out, they were more than happy to bag our stuff quickly so we could be in our way. I really love their lemonade, it is hard to find good lemonade sometimes. My wife loves their pecan pancakes. Only downfall, no military discount, and there tends to be more rude and closeted racist at this restaurant than most, I guess it has a lot to do with the name. Maybe I'll have better luck for lunch, I'm going to Mein Kampf Eatery, should work out great!"}
{"text":"If I could give them no stars, I absolutely would. Very negative experience and I will never go back! 

Firstly, my group was large (30 people)- family reunion 

Arrived to check in at 10:30 AM. Was told it was a 50-55 minute wait. Cool, we expected that as we are a large group. That wasn't the issue. 
1 hour 20 minutes later we were called saying our table was ready. As my family approached the host stand, the host said there was one 4top table was available and we'd have to be split into groups of 4. Also not a problem, had you expressed that when we checked in. Our family sizes are 4+, meaning we had to split kids and immediate families across the whole restaurant not even sitting together. 

So one group(4ppl) of our 30 got sat, the next 4 people waited 10/15 minutes than got sat, and so on....BUT for whatever the reason, the staff kept sitting different parties in between our group (said people arrived after my group). So now you have 20+ people just standing there not being sat, and other parties getting pushed ahead of us. The staff was so disorganized and confused. Our last group got sat at 12noon. My whole family was split up and spread across the restaurant. So the first group Was done and paid before the last table even got to order. 

I am very disappointed so I pulled the management aside to let them know the staff was failing to communicate effectively to me and my family, causing frustration and after all that I didn't even enjoy my experience at Cracker Barrel. Not only did the management not understand the issue but not taking accountability for his restaurant, only to say he would speak to his staff to work on communication. Not resolving the issue. 

Why would you tell us our tables are ready but only 1 4top was ready, you sat 10+ tops who checked in after us, then go around to the other tables apologizing because you had a large 30 top? When really you just had groups of 4 individual tables and not a 30 top. 

I will not return and I will not recommend anyone go to this location. Paid for garbage service and untrained staff!"}
{"text":"I LOVE IT... 
This place is one of my Up Early, Rise and Shine breakfast spots.

Try The Cracker Barrel Country Boy Breakfast---- Your choice of 
Country Ham, Pork Chops or Steak* grilled to order, Three Eggs* cooked to order served with Fried Apples, Hashbrown Casserole, Grits, Sawmill Gravy and Homemade Buttermilk Biscuits along with real Butter and the best Preserves, Jam n' Apple Butter available

here is where it begins... AFTER I ORDER COFFEE.

I ask for a BLOODY & RUNNY...
Steak = Medium
Eggs = Over easy

Its kinda too many food plates if you have a party of 3 or 4. 
One plate for buscuits
One plate for Sawmill Gravy (come in small bowl, that comes on saucer)
One plate for Grits (come in small bowl, that comes on saucer)
One plate for Hashbrown Casserole (come in small bowl, that comes on saucer)
One plate for Fried Apples (come in small bowl, that comes on saucer)
Thats a total of 8 dishes. 

not to mention what you actually order

NOT A BIG PROBLEM/ISSUE.. but, when your ready to get down you don't wanna spend 5 mins moving a bunch of plates, saucers, bowls, etc all over the place. 

(I know they are getting their monies worth from the dishwasher)"}
{"text":"Never again.  The apple french toast (~$12) and the sampler (includes a little of the chicken dumpling, sugar crusted ham, and meatloaf - ~$14) and both were huge disappointments.  The only saving grace, for me, was the cranberry-pomegranate (or something similar) iced tea, which wasn't too sweet (yay!) and very refreshing (~$3).  

Other important info: chain restaurant, country store and rocking chairs were fun, overwhelming menu, cleaning could be improved, and slow service."}
{"text":"Normally the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain is very good. Today, one of my two chicken patties on a biscuit had under cooked chicken on it, however, the other one was good. There seemed to be plenty of staff; but, the poor lady helping me had far too many tables to keep up... it's simply made things a bit slow. Then checking out and paying for the meal was par for the course. The lady that was trying to check me out kept telling me to insert my card chip in to the machine, and repeatedly I told her there is no chip on this card. After about 10 minutes she was able to figure out her register and complete the sale as needed. That explains to me why the line was so long to begin with.  The team was probably just having a bad day because normally there is nothing better than Cracker Barrel food. It is certainly worth giving this restaurant to try even though I am only giving them three stars."}
{"text":"(Dined in on 4/21/17~Catching up on my reviews)
Being from Tennessee I'm used to a Cracker Barrel at every other exit. Happy Vegas finally got a couple restaurants. I ordered my usual chicken fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, baby carrots, and replaced the home style gravy with brown gravy. Delicious!! I have tried unsuccessfully to make those melt in your mouth baby carrots. Oh well guess I have to keep coming to CB. 
Our waiter Laquan is an awesome waiter! He came back by and checked on us several times. Smiling each time.
Only thing I wish when you got biscuits they still brought jelly. You have to ask for it now. I never think about it untill biscuits come and there's no jelly.
Very clean restaurant and restrooms. Happy employees. Love browsing around the store. 
Definitely will be back! This southern girl says A+"}
{"text":"Usually, we have an excellent experience at Cracker Barrel. It's one of our favorite places for breakfast/lunch when my family comes to visit. 

However, Flo's rudeness to our table and the table next to us left us feeling less than pleased after our meal. During our ordering, she was quick and didn't answer questions. In addition, she curtly said to my friend, \"The mamma's French toast breakfast comes with eggs and bacon. And you're okay with that.\" Instead of even offering other options to my friend or waiting for her to question the side options; my friend has never been here before, so she had no idea sausage was an option because of how curtly Flo said it.

Furthermore, she never took our drink order. She brought water initially saying she didn't have time to take our order yet  and then came back to take our food order; she seemed upset to have to take our drink order when we had to later ask. She also spoke slower and louder as if she was taking to someone with special needs when speaking to my mother; my mother is just in a walker, and not with any mental incapacities that would warrant that type of speech. 

She seemed to have this same demeanor with the two elderly gentleman we were seated by. She also openly complained to our table that she had to help them before helping us; it was an awkward exchange. 

I understand that the restaurant is packed, and service is rushed, but her attitude isuncalled for. 

Our table of 6 is filled with people who work in the service industry, so trust me when I say we know how hard it is. However, none of us have ever made a table feel uncomfortable by rude treatment or the treatment of the table next to them. 

Flo still received a tip of 15%; because I know what it's like to survive off tips. However, I would like to say that she missed out on something much bigger. More importantly, it brought down my rating of Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel pancakes + maple syrup are the best!  Love this restaurant - they need to add Cracker Barrel in California"}
{"text":"Kaylee and I had lunch and met some new people that work here. We just finished a hike in the mountains so we had no guilt. We splurged in the fun gift shop after having a good time and good food. There was a holiday sale and I purchased a new cast iron bacon pan, among other great finds. Love the Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Love the service and Grits!  Really fast service every time we come. Nice country feel, love the area and little country store. Don't forget you can buy a rocking chair if you feel the need. Can't beat the Country Gravy!"}
{"text":"Worse restaurant I have been to. I asked for a medium rare ribeye steak. It came out well done. When I complained to the manger, he told me \"our ribeye is thin so next don't order it.\" He made it seem like it was my fault for ordering the steak. How about you learn to cook the meat you guys serve. 

We tried this restaurant because they are opening one next to our house so we wanted to test it out. I will never spend another dollar at this chain."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Cracker Barrel then you'll find this pretty much exactly like every other cracker barrel. Service is efficient and fast but still very friendly. Managers wander the floor making sure everyone is doing well. I've never had more than a 5 minute wait here which is definitely appreciated. I feel like it's mostly locals at this location, which is different than many other, more tourist oriented Cracker Barrel's I've been to. The store always has a fun rotating selection of products from old timey sodas and candy to really awesome flamingo themed merchandise! Meatloaf is always my go to here and all the sides are great! Get the meatloaf!"}
{"text":"17 minutes of sitting , asked three times to order only to be told that they were not my waitress but they will inform my waitress.  How about working as a team , take our order and take It up with so said waitress later. Gave up and went elsewhere"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel breakfast! I came by here for a quick meal, biscuits and gravy with eggs and bacon! It was selections, quick and served by friendly service. It was very clean in there and busy but I still didn't wait long to eat."}
{"text":"We showed up at 12:00 and had a party of 11 and hey said 20 min well a hour later still no table so we left and went to Burger King will not go back !!!!!"}
{"text":"Ah the tour of the great Ohio airport wasteland continues. They get 3 stars because they are better than Bob Evans but that isn't saying much, the last time I went to Bob Evans I ordered the \"Fruit and Yogurt crepes\" which ended up being thin cold pancakes topped with yoplait and craisins. 

I do love all the tacky stuff in the gift shop and they have this weird sweet sourbread that we love for toast. The service is quick and friendly. The hashbrown casserole is shredded potatoes and cheese so it is obviously delicious. My mom loves the cinnamon apples and they do have good pancakes. Don't bother with the sausage gravy or grits, they are geared towards senior citizens. The sausage gravy is flavorless except for the taste of raw flour, I don't even think \"sausage\" is in the description anymore. The grits as far as I can tell do not have butter or salt in them which is just terrible. 

All that being said it is pretty much our best bet for finding something my parents and I can agree on that isn't terribly out of the way or Bob Evans on the way home from the airport. Also I may just be coming from a Seattle perspective but the prices are crazy cheap, just order the big breakfast and tell them not to bring out the gravy or grits and it is still a great deal."}
{"text":"Finally visited the Cracker Barrel that opened near Silverton Casino.  As we are originally from the Midwest and have visted C.B.'s numerous times we were hoping it would live up to our expectations.  Happily, it exceeded them.  Although crowded, we waited only about 10 minutes for a table.  Server was there immediately.  Courteous, prompt, good food. Not sure what some of the people who gave negative reviews were expecting, but this Cracker Barrel is just like the ones dotting the country East of Nevada.  Good food (if not spectacular) and reasonable prices.  Maybe you have to be from the Midwest to appreciate those qualities."}
{"text":"Before you can have a meal at Cracker Barrel, you have to wait in their old country store for your name to be called. Genius. 
This way you'll be sure to purchase something you don't need at all, like apple shaped measuring cups, poodle shaped ear muffs, a dancing bear, rock candy...the list goes on. 
At least it gives you something to look at while you wait for your table, right?
Cracker Barrel definitely has an old country feel to it. The porch has cute rocking chairs for people to sit in before or after their meal and the interior is very homey.  
The breakfast menu is filled with comfort foods like chicken 'n dumplings and biscuits and gravy, but I always opt for the standard scrambled eggs and potatoes.  The food is pretty good and best of all, it's also pretty cheap. Just don't succumb to the trap that is their old country store. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"Waking thru the country store, I was not sure I was in the right place. All those cars outside on a sunday morning led me to believe I had to sprint to the hostess stand for a table. But this place is huge, and there was no wait at all. They could even seat six tops without a wait! We scored a table right by the front window, and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress for drinks. She pointed out the two most popular dishes on the menu - pancake breakfast (think grand slam at denny's)  or the standard meat, eggs, biscuits and gravy.Big menu, but no omelets? I had the french toast w/ bacon. It was cold and leathery. Husband had the grand-slam thing - it was a lot o f food w/ a  big bowl of  canned tasting gravy.   Food was just ok. Coffee was bad. Service was great. Won't go back  - there are better breakfast places in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"I love coming here! They get you seated right away... that is if you can get out of the gift shop first. The food was amazing as always and the service was even better. Couldn't empty my drink fast enough for them to bring out a new refill lol. Jeni was awesome I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"A family favorite! It's always busy here, especially on weekends. Get there early, like before 9 or be prepared to wait! Our hack is that we call our order in and pick up! My favorite things about Cracker Barrel are the pancakes and hash brown casserole. The pancakes have some corn meal in them and have a crunch on the edges. Paired with their own hot syrup, so yum! I sneak a few tiny bottles home...why not?! 

I've had lunch once and order their daily special (which varies day to day) and it was pretty good! Portion size was more than I expected and the chicken was tender. 

I love the store! I could spend a lot of time looking around. There are some unique candies, chocolates, beverages, and jams/jellies you would not find in a regular store. They sell holiday items and decor, kids toys, and a bunch of other pretty cool things. 

Service is kind and attentive!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cracker Barrel once or twice before (long ago), and just had to visit one before heading back home to Los Angeles where we don't have any nearby.

It is a store with lots of knick-knacks and a restaurant with good old-fashion country food.

There are a bunch of rocking chairs you will see as you walk down the long porch/patio to the front door.  There are some for sale.  Such a cool country feel to it.  Sit a spell and relax.  You can play checkers while you wait.  We had to wait for our entire party to arrive before we could put our name on the list to be seated.  Once they arrived, we were seated rather quickly.

They were busy and our food arrived at the table cold.  We had 7 in our party.  The service was okay, I think our waitress was there and then disappeared and then reappeared later on.  

My husband ordered a breakfast combo with scrambled eggs, sausage, & hashed browns.  It was rather basic.  I got the Blueberry Pancakes, they were really, really, really delicious!  They bring out individual bottles of maple and blueberry syrups.  I got the blueberry syrup and was surprised that the syrup contained real blueberries!  It was deliciously awesome!  My daughter ordered french toast with maple syrup.  If the food had arrived promptly to the table, it would have been ideal!  

When you are ready to settle your bill, you have to take the ticket to the cashiers in the store to pay.

The store is full of cute things!  There were a few items I would have bought, but I restrained!  The pig salt & pepper holder was cute!  I would have liked to taste the Divinity although it would not compare to my mother-in-law's fresh divinity!!  They had their Easter items out as well as a religious section of goodies.  There was a big poster announcing the sale of the new Casting Crowns CD, which I thought was rather neat.  

If I ever return to this Cracker Barrel, I sure hope the food is hot when it is brought out to the table!  I should have told the manager when she walked by and asked us how things were.  We asked for more syrups and she then went and had the waitress bring them out.  I guess she herself doesn't get things for guests.  I was really hoping this would warrant 5-stars, but it just didn't measure up."}
{"text":"Not a good experience here this evening. Cracker Barrel has sure gone downhill. My parents and I were very underwhelmed to say the least. My mom was told the chicken she wanted was available but it was not so she picked the cod fish fry special to replace it. She asked for fries and carrots. And got carrots and mashed potatoes. So they took back the fish with mashed potatoes and brought her fish with carrots...that's double carrots and no fries. The fries were an additional 6 minute wait. And don't bother trying to sub in a baked potato because there is an up charge...apparently bc they are so big but unfortunately I have no picture to prove that. They brought my fish dinner with only two of the four pieces that were to come with it. The fries were lackluster. I'll give it to them, the fish was tasty. However, we had asked to get butter that wasn't hard as a rock and that didn't happen. A floor manager stopped over and even after hearing that the visit was less than stellar all she offered was more water and if we wanted more butter. Not my idea of amazing customer service. The manager at the counter was better and did listen to the complaints and we were lucky enough to get the bill slightly discounted.

All in all, Cracker Barrel likes to think they are good place to gather with friends and family but we won't be going back. We bid you farewell cracker barrel. If you ever get it back on track maybe we will venture in."}
{"text":"Food is plain and simple, no flavor...too much hype for this place. Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"We arrived with a party of 26, and waited for about an hour and a half. They accommodated us as far as splitting our checks for each couple and their kids. The s'mores desert tasted amazing! Would definitely come back when in the area."}
{"text":"If you love old fashioned country food, this is your place! This is the food of the south, it's all yummy comfort food!"}
{"text":"Worse Cracker Barrel I've been in. I called my order in and was told it would take 10-15 minutes. I arrived 20 mins after I placed the call and was told by Destani that they brought my food out 10 mins prior to me coming. I pod and still had to wait another 20 minutes before they brought my food out. I almost asked for a refund because they were taking forever. Not only that, she asked me to fill out my receipt and I put my total as $15 and she still charged me for $16, in which I didn't make a big deal of. Fast forward......I got back to my hotel, 25 minutes away and my food wasn't what it was supposed to be. It was much less meat than it's supposed it be. In fact, it was only two bites of meat and plenty veggies. I will NEVER come to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Gah! Wish u weren't so far away. 

We were down in Urbana for my brother's gradation and came to breakfast before the big event. 

I had never been to Cracker Barrel before but after this experience, I will definitely be back. The food was delicious. I loved the baked apples. 
The coffee cup was kept full.
I love the idea of the little peg game on the table to play while you wait. 

The waitress was so sweet and offered me a cup of coffee to go. 

Super nice staff throughout."}
{"text":"Good country food.  Good service.  Little shop on your way out."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat my favorite Chicken N Rice from Cracker Barrell. I was getting hungry waiting for our table cause the wait is still pretty long. But after the server brought my food...disappointed. The kitchen was unable to accommodate my request to sub for the marinated chicken. The portions were significantly less than other locations in AZ and UT. I was expecting that same quality and taste, but I was very disappointed. The rice was hard and didn't care for the flavor. I'm even considering a drive up to Utah to get my fix...you might find me there next weekend. The service is less than average but I'm guessing it's because of the recent opening and the crowds of people eating here."}
{"text":"Honestly there's much better spots in town to grab breakfast or lunch but there's something nostalgic and old-timey about Cracker Barrel that I just love!
As soon as I enter the gift shop it immediately takes me back to being there with my family as a 10 year old. 

Classic American/southern breakfast that will leave you feeling full and satisfied! Although I think their sausage gravy could use a little work. You don't really get any pepper or sausage flavor, it just kind of just tastes like salt. Scrambled eggs are great, bacon is great, pancakes are awesome!

I grew up in Arizona where Cracker Barrels are abundant but Las Vegans are pretty dang excited about getting one! Definitely worth stopping by for breakfast every now and then."}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is located in North Las Vegas.  It is like all other Cracker Barrels in the USA, located right off the freeway.  Because it is away from the strip, coming here was easy.  

I had the steak and eggs.  My wife had the catfish and my daughter ordered the Mac n Cheese.  Food was good and tasty.  The steak was cooked perfectly rare for me.  My wife was satisfied with her fish and the child all of her Mac n Cheese.  

Service was nice and quick at this Cracker Barrel.  We told the waitress that we were in a hurry.  She made a note to rush the order.  She came out to check on us a couple of times.  The bathrooms were clean.  

It's a nice little chain restaurant.  If they only had locations in California.  If they were closer, I definitely would be back."}
{"text":"Horrible! Who would ever wait in line for this slop? Food tastes like Hospital food bland and no taste. Waitress was excellent but food was terrible."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Cracker Barrels I've ever been to.  Same standard Cracker Barrel food, but very well made.  Not too greasy and it came out hot.  Really friendly, attentive staff.  I had the oatmeal with the pumpkin muffin - delicious! Would eat here again for sure."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant for brunch with my momma. Wait was relatively short - considering it was Saturday morning. But the time waiting for our table flew by because we were able to spend our time inside the lovely shop they have. The little store was filled from the ceiling to the floors of mostly fun little nic-nacs, family games and more. 

Breakfast was good, and filling. Large portions and the price was relatively normal $10-12/person. I had the grilled chicken BLT and my mom enjoyed a large breakfast with pancakes and all. Honestly out of both of our meals- the pancakes were the most memorable. Food was nice, restaurant is clean, and the service was great. 

I will visit again in the future, but it is not on the top of my list for brunch joints."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. I had the country fried steak and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was very good. I love the sides. I had okra and the biscuits are great."}
{"text":"Enjoy the Family atmosphere and the old time charm. Jamie our waitress is excellent in her job"}
{"text":"I understand people are tired from working all day but to ignore us for 30 mins. Gives us attitude cues one person at our table who showed  up late did not know what she wanted yet, and spills tea all over our table casing us to clean it up with our our napkins cues she never came back with anything to write it up with or apologizes for making a mess. This was the quest time I've had here ever. The only thing that made me give 2 stars is the food. But the service here has defiantly gone down hill. I will customer service i know what it's like and i still work hard no matter how tired or what age you are."}
{"text":"I had never ate at a Cracker Barrel everyone told me I would love it and they was right!!! I had chicken livers, pinto beans , turnip greens and the corn bread muffins, and this Southern girl was in Heaven !!!My husband had rib eye steak, turnip greens, okra, broccoli  and he loves his too, we will be going back as soon as we can !!!!"}
{"text":"My husband took me there on Saturday for a early Mother's Day lunch . It was great! I signed in ahead of time online so when we got there we went on in and the waiting time was only about 2 minutes . I had Chicken Livers, Pinto Beans, Turnip Greens  they was so good!!! My husband had the Chicken BLT and Cole Slaw, and he loved it. Our server was named Jaz and she was great . We will be back soon !! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"My brother has been wanting to come here for ages so on Sunday we finally decided to give it a try. We tried calling for a reservation because there was going to be 10 of us and we were told we can not make a reservation. So we went and were told it was going to be a one hour wait. There were so many people waiting so I thought to myself it must really be great. The store is really cute so I suggest checking it out.
We were finally seated. We ordered and everything was fine. The servers were really nice. I appreciated the service and positive attitudes.
The reason for the 3 stars however is because the food is just not great to the point where I would drive all the way down there and wait an hour to eat. I got a salad. It wad standard but the chicken was dry. The cool thing was that it came with a devil egg rather than the standard boiled eggs"}
{"text":"Just ok, we visited here shortly after they opened and found they had some growing pains to work thru. All three meals ordered seemed to be less fresh made tasting and more out of the freezer tasting. Very attentive wait staff but too many of them trying to make sure we had what we needed caused confusion and we ended up short on some items and over on others. Bottom line: the food was just ok but not up to the standards set by most Cracker Barrells across the nation. They need time to get the food preparation down to an art."}
{"text":"I like Cracker Barrell, don't get me wrong. I like this Cracker Barrell. Because of my experiences at this one, I'm typically unafraid to walk into any of them anywhere. They have a good, broad menu, stay true to their formula, and you get great value.
Great waitstaff (good job, Megan, and good luck with that new house!) - attentive and friendly! 
The Pecan chicken meal my buddy ordered looked (and was reported to be) delicious.
My Shephard's Pie? Well, the cup of vegetable soup I ordered was pretty good, and I always like the biscuits. The Pie? Seriously...not so much. Visual appeal and tactile presence akin to slurried dog chow. Avoid that, and I'm sure you'll be good to go. Ugh.
But I do like Cracker Barrell!"}
{"text":"I honestly only come for breakfast but if you've got a group looking for a southern style meal then head over to the C.B. As it's a family style restaurant.

The wait use to be the issue for me but now you can go online to put your name on the waitlist so when u show up you aren't caught up in store buying a bunch of stuff (or trying not to break stuff) 

Overall food is good and comes out pretty quick. The congestion of people in the store or just the tables when eating can be a bit overwhelming. I'm a bit of a germ sensitive person so I gotta wipe down that Peg game (addictive game) and do wish they could do more to clean the tables and floors, but so much traffic it's hard to do without having a bucket out mopping or cleaning. 

I can never figure out the rules for bread (maybe for dinner request, but we always ask for it. Cornbread, biscuits, butter and jam...

Additional Bottles of syrup available on request and I have to admit the staff seems to work together to support each other. 

Cleanliness is a priority for me so would like to see more done to improve overall restaurant & restrooms... I want it to feel more like s restaurant and not a truck stop country store."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night. Waited over an HOUR for our order. Watched the manager go around our section offering to comp meals and give people desserts.....nothing. Oh wait, got extra biscuits for waiting. Never received an apology from the manager. I love the food but the service in the evenings is terrible."}
{"text":"Sorry was here opening day,  fantastic! Today however a 45 minute wait for our food.  Excuse the kitchen is backed up and very busy.  I didn't mind waiting 55 minutes,  just a little disappointed in the time it took to get our food."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Food is low in price because the quality its very poor! Horrible service, and you have to pay at a cashier just to pay your bill...what a joke. it looks like a retirement home. Everybody is elderly there, on the weekend that I went there were 15 Walkers along the wall..but most importantly the food was garbage. If your looking for a good breakfast place I recommend driving down the street to the good egg our the place. Those places use good quality meat...not crap that looks and taste like plastic like cracker barrel has."}
{"text":"Standard country kitchen food for your morning

Cracker Barrel is a good go-to place when you have a taste for a heavy Midwestern breakfast.  Good number of fried, egg, potato, meat, and salty sides to hit the spot.  Can get a little loud with all the conversations in a fairly large, open eating area.

The service is usually very good and you aren't left waiting for your food.  There is often a wait of 10 to 20 minutes, but it's cool since you can wander the country store part of the restaurant in the interim.  Tons of knickknacks and old-time candy to peruse to occupy your time.

Not a haute cuisine place, but one you will enjoy for those family breakfasts where you just want to spend time with each other over a heap of food. :o)"}
{"text":"Saw the cracker barrel across the parking lot after leaving the bass pro shop..heard nothing but good things about the store..there isn't one in San Diego, so we went and definitely was not dissapointed..fish and chips with coleslaw soooo frickn good..the bowl of pinto beans with ham an onion crazy good..Ian our server was off the chain..awesome service..hurry up and open in S.D..nuff said"}
{"text":"I lived in Austin, Texas for 7 years and would eat there as often as I could. I was soooooo surprise that Vegas had one.
I was not disappointed the food  is like you were still in the South. Service was outstanding and the staff GREAT.

There is one problem, I go Broke every time I am there. I WANT TO PURCHASE EVERYTHING!"}
{"text":"Watch out when you eat here, you never know what you may find in your food. There was an eyelash or that is what it looked like,you never know it could be something else. Gross"}
{"text":"The best place and a variety of food, I love their blueberry pancakes with real blueberries cooked inside the batter the way it should, and they give you a jar sealed with real blueberries inside jar.  Flannery is the best server & so is aumon"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service.  I only go to this location and have never had an issue with anything. Very consistent food each time I go. I really like the meatloaf. The staff is friendly and helpful in the store section as well."}
{"text":"The waitress are always upbeat and friendly. The food is mediocre and does not live up to the hype of Crackel Barrels before putting them here in Vegas. Small portions I guess for the price that is being charged. Not always hot  & fresh tasting. May be more fresher & hot if ordering alone."}
{"text":"Ive ate here a few times. Its always good. I usually have breakfast but today i had country fried steak it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel always has hot food and good service.  However this last visit like other customers my husband ordered a medium ribeye and it came to the table well done.  He is not a complainer so he did not send it back.  They need to find employees who can cook a steak!  Not that hard!"}
{"text":"I am coming back to get that Buttermilk Oven Fried Chicken Breast meal!

I never tasted chicken so juicy and flavorful! I was honestly in awe. It swear I was eating at a steakhouse, and my food was a $50 plate. 

Your employee's were nice and always checked on us. They never let our drinks get empty. The prices were great! The game on the table kept us busy while we waited for our food. The decor around the room makes you get lost in it. The gift shop is all random and will be also getting more of my money. 

I can't wait to try something else at your wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"I once went to Amish Country for a field trip and was not impressed.  Yea, they can make all their own foods and toys but I really enjoy electricity and a hot shower.  Whenever I step into Cracker Barrel I feel like I'm back in Amish Country.  Not to mention an entire family was murdered here.  I don't like it and probably will never step foot back inside unless I'm looking for a carved wooden horse!"}
{"text":"Wish they had Cracker Barrel. In California. Went there twice while in Arizona and loved it. 1st time midday not crowded good service great food. Quick hot and good. 2nd time waiting told us 15-20. What I like is when they call a party they then tell the next party you are next called when table is available that way they are ready. They were moving people in and out fast. Got seated took order and got food fast again. Love this place."}
{"text":"I'd heard so many good things about Cracker Barrel so off we went.  At 2pm on a Thursday we were easily seated at The Silverton location. The waitress was quick but informative. The food came very quickly. I chose the sampler (ham, meatloaf, chicken and dumplings) with three side dishes. The portions were good. The biscuit was delicious! I liked the ham the best.  It was perfect, and the chicken and dumplings were good as well.  My husband ordered the meatloaf which was just ok. All the sides (corn, baked apples and mashed potato's) were good. The atmosphere was pleasant enough but loud. It would have been too loud for me if the restaurant were full.  Problem is both of us were sick that night and the only thing in common was the meatloaf.  If We hadn't gotten ill I would have given it five stars.  We will probably go again as there are other things I'd like to try.  Hopefully they'll open one on the northwest side of town.  The price was approx $15 per person."}
{"text":"I can tell you that this place was very special to me as a Young Man. Going here I was very excited. We went on a Saturday so it was extremely crowded. It was just ok. It took an hour and 15 minutes after ordering the food to receive it. The server however was an absolute sweetheart, I do not blame her for anything. If it's anybody's fault it had to be the kitchen's fault. Also food was just ok I believe it suffered because of how busy they were. I hope they get their s*** together I really do."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Cracker Barrel's around the country but this is my 1st visit to the Vegas location.  We walked in on Saturday night around 8pm. We were seated immediately and quickly asked for drinks.  Then we ordered dinner a few minutes later.  Our service was great.  They had many servers working and staying on top of the customers.  I've read previous reviews and saw negative comments about wait time, restrooms and service.  Those were probably just grand opening glitches that needed fixing.  Probably common with many busy restaurants.   There was hardly any wait, the food was great, service was great and the restrooms were fine.  Wife had porkchop w/okra.  Son had biscuits and gravy w/bacon and I had the hamburger steak w/veggies.  We were all happy with our meals and left full and it's not expensive at all.  Under $30 total for 3 people and iced teas.  If you like home cooked meals with great service and a cool gift shop up front.  Come check this place out.  There's a lot of places to choose from in Vegas.  Not like this though...."}
{"text":"Great service and decent food.  The breakfast is the king here.  Be sure to get the pancakes..  Also, they had the blackberry cobbler which is a must have.   For dinner, I ordered the grilled catfish with baked apples, baked potatoes (extra cost), and a side salad.  The catfish was tasty and not over seasoned."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim en route back  from my girlfriend's abode. At first we were going to try Dor-Stop again, but while passing through Robinson or Moon or wherever (?) she says to me, \"Ever been to Cracker Barrel?\"

\"Uh, no. Are we near one?\"

Before I could utter another word, she was switching lanes and charging up a hill.

As I got out of the car, I smelled a campfire. That's when I knew that we weren't at Bob Evans. 

As Madre stated in her review, you must bypass a gift shop of sorts to get into the dining area, which I welcomed. Since we were both starving, we waited until after breakfast for the shopping portion of the experience though.

I got Uncle Herschel's Favorite, if for no other reason than you can get catfish with it.

Catfish. For breakfast. With eggs. With tartar sauce yet. 

Some people 'round these parts would scratch their heads over such a concept. But methinks The South is onto something here. I chose to have mine fried, but you can also get the fish broiled if you want. You can also get chicken, ham two ways, pork chops, and I think sirloin steak, but leave it to me and my Aquarian dare-to-be-different ways. 

You also get Buttermilk Biscuits with Sawmill Gravy (???), two eggs (got mine o'er easy), grits (!!!), and your choice of Hash Brown Casserole and Fried Apples. I got the apples, which are essentially apple pie sans the filling and are therefore...essential. What a way to stay reg'lar y'know?

Now, considering that I got fish with my eggs, grits, and biscuits, I did something that is becoming a lost art; I actually ate everything together one bite at a time. Fish 'n eggs 'n grits function flawlessly together. 

And those grits...damn. This was only the second time I had grits, the first being at Cherries Diner in Downtown Pittsburgh. That first time I was underwhelmed. This time?

I now want to eat grits with chili, oysters, chicken, shrimp, beef tips, salmon. I want to put it on a burger. I want to eat it with goulash, gumbo, gravy. I want to form grits into spheres and plunge them into hot lard. 

I want grits with everything, anything, every which way I can have them. And all they needed was a pat of butter and a pinch of sugar. 

The fish was fork tender, the gravied biscuits stuck to my ribs, the eggs done up perfectly, the fried apples too sinful to be served with a savory meal. I forgot I was at a chain. 

This was especially true when I tanked up thrice with their Raspberry Lemonade, served in a godly frosted glass mug no doubt. There was ice on it! A tangy and cold tonic, it was worthy of a Norse God who just slew a Frost Giant. What a beverage. Orange juice? Bah! What's this Coca-Cola I hear about? Speaking of the devil...

Kay and I shared The Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola Cake. How's that for something suvvern bell Paula Dean would conjure? 

 I asked about it and our fabulous, golden-hearted, supraprofessional server told us that \"it flies out of here it's so good.\" 

It's unassuming enough. You get what looks like a Texas sheet cake with icing.  Many places serve a warmed-through fudgy choco-cake alongside ice cream...but none of them do it as well as Cracker Barrel. 

Come to think of it, I've heard Coca-Cola bandied about as a killer secret ingredient in chocolate cake, and I can now see why. It makes a chocolate cakeall the more demoniacally dewy and delectable. How such a quaint restaurant can get away with serving something so maleficent is beyond my comprehension. Gullifty's has not a chance. 

That ice cream cuts the richness and sweetness like nobody's business, making for quite the Heaven and Hell combo. You can even see the specks of vanilla in their ice cream; a tell-tale indicator that your vanilla ice cream is superior.

I did get to taste Kay's Hash Brown Casserole and almost became envious. Yum-yum gimme some. I'll order it next time.

Onto the gift shop. They have everything from wind-up toys (Kay got some for her grandpa who collects them. I didn't know they could dance too!) and puzzle games to TV shows on DVD and even the new Smokey Robinson rekkid. 

I almost bought a Weazel Ball...

...for the cats. 

It was like a Johnson Smith catalog come to life!

And yes, just like J/S, Cracker Barrel sells whoopie cushions. 

Go. You'll eat good. You'll get exceptional service from what must be happily dedicated employees (their names are sewn onto their uniforms, and most of the servers looked to be over-30). You'll have a laugh. You'll smile. Go. I mean it.

P.S. Our bill was $23 (not including $5 tip I left) and some change. Had we not ordered dessert, our check would have been under $20. This means that I had one of the most memorable, hospitable, favorable breakfasts ever for just under a 10-spot. I dunno about you, but I think that rules."}
{"text":"After being seated we waited close to 15 minutes to be greated by our server Michael. He immediately asked for our drink order. He then stood there and,asked for our food order. The restaurant was not busy with many open tables. Michael was not very attentive to us as we still waited for drinks that came with our meals. He was missing one drink and promised to get it. The food was look warm at best. A kids meal hamburger wad so overcook the hr couldn't eat it. Michael said he would replace it. We still didn't get the missing drink. The replacement hamburger was no better than the original. We asked again for the missing beverage. Michael's answer was sorry but it's so busy and it's the time of the day. What does 2:30 on Wednesday have to do with poor service. He said he would replace the cols hash brown casserole. The replacement was burned.   Michael's one of the worst servers and doesn't seen to care or enjoy his job.  We've eaten in many Cracker Barrel's and this is by far the worse. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"I love the food & service. It's a great place for a date or family dinner. I used to drive across town to go to the one on blue diamond I believe but now this one is closer to home & same great taste."}
{"text":"Food was ok except no option with breakfast except grits.  Woman's bathroom was a total mess.  Hand towels all over the floor and sink counters.  NO TOILET PAPER in any stalls.  Very obvious the room hadn't been cleaned in hours.  Even notified the hostess and afterwards.  Nothing happened to correct the problem."}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrel twice and both times I've ordered breakfast and had good experiences. The French toast is the best! The worst part is the long wait. I like that they have a store with different things from toys, big sized candy to clothes and furniture. If you're in the area, you should check it out."}
{"text":"WOW, just WOW! Authentic down home cooking at it's best!  First time eating here!  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"We arrived on a Saturday nite at 6:30.
There was a nice fire going in the fireplace.
The waitress took 15 minutes to bring us coffee. 
Another waitress helped us. 
The waitress for the table finally came over and took the order. Then, once the meal was served, my eggs were ice cold and the hash browns were quite small and the wrong type. She fixed that issue.
But there was a real issue for my guest.
The Pancakes were served and at first glimpse looked fine. But turning them over, they were charred black. Evidently, the cook  had turned the burnt side over, so they looked fine.
We told the Manager, but she did not take this off the bill. She instead remade the meal. 
As we paid the bill, the cashier drew attention to us and the tip, and announced it loudly, so others could hear it. I explained the service was bad and the meal was horrible.
We will not be going back under any circumstances. 
Feeding a customer a burnt meal is not OK, under any circumstances. Further, tipping should be based on good service and a good meal. Goodbye Cracker Barrel. Too many very bad experiences. Serving someone a burnt meal is not acceptable and a health hazard. Goodbye forever Cracker Barrel. Feeding a customer trash is not acceptable on any level."}
{"text":"After waiting 30 minutes and noting that no one had their food in the dining room, the Manager visited tables empty handed, and actually told the customers that the cook did not know what he was doing and it was going to be a long wait.  The vibe was almost pleading for us to leave. Three tables left. We stayed, half curious and darn hungry.
If I were that manager, I would have rolled up my sleeves and would have been training the cook by example in the kitchen.
The waitress was also telling us how \"crazy\" it was and how busy she was. The food came after 45 minutes and it was not my order and had to be returned. When my meal came, it was ice cold. 
The table next to us was told they sold out of the meatloaf. You could feel the upset in the dining room. It was Saturday at 5:30pm. Prime time for dinner.
Where are the District Managers? How can they run a restaurant like this? This was like a bad comic strip. No laughing matter."}
{"text":"Great food for the price,  had the 2 Catfish dinner with 3 side dishes,  finished the whole meal,  very delicious,  service was great,  will probably go back today since I'm staying at the Holiday Inn Express next door for a couple more days"}
{"text":"Homestyle cooking in a restaurant!  Hangout on the front \"porch\" in rocking chairs.  Play life-size checkers inside or outside the restaurant."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern, 


 On our visit to your store in Las Vegas, Dean Martin Blvd, 12/20/16 9AM. We had the most unpleasant  experience of any restaurant I have ever visited.  I have a daughter in a wheel chair and her friend was also with us that is in a wheelchair  I don't mind waiting my turn,  but when  10 parties are called ahead of me  I find that hard to accept .  The host told us they were trying to make room for us  But when a party of 7 is seated that came in after us.  I find it hard to believe that they could not make room for us. A party of 2 that came in after us including a wheel chair was also seated before us. 
 After we were finally seated.  I looked at the table next to us and the had a small puppy with them and they were passing the puppy back and forth around the table.   The dog hair was flying in my directions  I asked to speak the the manger but he failed to come by my table.  So I went looking for him and voiced my concerns  He told me they would be leaving soon. And did nothing  His name was Dan   I asked if the dog was a service dog and maybe it was being trained but he said NO it just their pet  .  I feel that is very unhealthy to say the least when food is being served and dog hair it all around.  And the food was AWFUL  cold not brought out in a timely manner.  All in all one the WORST visit I have ever had in any restaurant.  I will be telling all my family and friends to NEVER visit the cracker barrel in Las Vegas. 

Friends don't let friends eat here."}
{"text":"My family and I have been to this restaurant many times and normally the food and service is good. We have a two year old who sits in a high chair and every other time when we have gone he sits on the outside of the table with no problems but when we went this time the greeter absolutely would not let him sit in the isle at the end of the table and he had to be seated on the inside of the table.. Since when is this policy? I have never experienced this and was very disappointed, so much so that we left and won't be returning."}
{"text":"First let me preface that I love CBOCS.  I've eaten in too many to mention from WVA to NV and points in between.  These 2 in Vegas leave so much to be desired.  First we set down we've a waitress asking for our drink order, we give it and before that one can get out of sight another comes and asks for the same thing.  Then before our drinks arrive, we're ask what we'd like to order (I can't decide between B'fast and lunch) Finally we order and our order arrives, no jelly for my biscuits and no salad that was with my husband's order. I had to ask a manager for the jelly and my husband ask 2 different waiters for his salad, which arrived after he'd finished his meal. I watched 2 different tables of 10 in front of me receive their orders.  The tables are pushed together but approachable from either end.  The waiter stays on one end and asks the people to hand the food down til it reaches the correct person...not 1 table of 10 but 2 were handled the same way. Amazing"}
{"text":"My husband is from the south and he loves his southern cookin. Cracker Barrel is fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. We are so happy they opened in Vegas as they would always be on our route during road trips"}
{"text":"There was no wait to be seated and the food was good.  The order was correct and food came to the table in a decent amount of time (not too slow, not too fast).  Bathrooms needed cleaning.  The country store section had lots of Christmas decorations."}
{"text":"The only reason to eat here would be if you don't know how to cook!!!  Not impressed at all.  The wait was 1.75 hrs.  Food definitely NOT worth it. Food is bland.  Not sure what was worse...the cornbread or biscuits.  The only good was the staff."}
{"text":"Ok, before I write this review I need to tell you this one issue I have, so that you can fully understand how much I love this restaurant. I hate crowds. I get anxious. I get shaky and uneasy if I am stuck in a small area with massive amounts of people. So there you go, now that you know that about me, I must tell you I have never been in to this restaurant/store when it has NOT been crowded. In the front part of the restaurant, you are greeted with tons of merchandise, which people who are waiting to have their names called are milling around looking at everything. More than a few times, we have had to squeeze between people in order to just to the check in area at the front of the dining area. I'm okay with that, because I know there is a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow. I can smell it: syrup, bacon, butter. Okay, I am starting to drool just thinking about it. Anywho, where was I? Oh yes, I am willing to risk an anxiety attack as long as I know where I will be seated in about 5 minutes. Their wait times are not bad at all, granted you are not there at 11am on Sunday morning. The time you spend looking at all their knick knacks seems to speed along the wait time exponentially. I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. The waitresses are always friendly and fast! The prices are so cheap for how much food you get (my two kids and I can share one plate of pancakes, eggs, and bacon and still probably have left overs). The bacon is always crisp to perfection, the pancakes are fluffy and buttermilky delicious, and the eggs are always perfectly cooked too. The coffee is pretty good as far as restaurant coffee goes, what more could you expect? And I think that is it for this review. You ever invite me out for breakfast, you'd better believe I will try to talk you in to going to Cracker Barrel with me. :)"}
{"text":"Called in a to go order at 4:52 pm on Saturday May 27th.  Person who took the call told me  the food would be ready in 10 minutes. Arrived and paid for the food at 5:08 pm. After waiting 25 minutes I finally had to ask an employee to check on my order.  They finally brought out my order almost 45 minutes after it was called in.  No apology, no acknowledgement.  Nothing. 
When I got home the food was \"warm\" at best.  My guess is the food sat after it was prepared and no one cared enough to bring it out.  This was worst service I have ever experienced at a Cracker Barrel."}

{"text":"Went back again to the Gastonia Cracker Barrel. Ordered the seasonal \"Cinnamon Biscuit Breakfast\" did not come with a cinnamon biscuit. When we asked the waitress she returned with a rock hard biscuit and said, \"There's only one. You'll have to share.\"  I asked to have the two we ordered and she came back and said, \"It will be 25 minutes. If you're still here I'll bring you some.\" Terrible customer service is becoming a habit at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We arrived in the middle of lunch rush... Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table.  Lots of stuff to browse while waiting and it's super adorable to be able to play checkers while we wait. The chicken fried steak was as good as I remembered and I'd recommend that anytime.  Mac n cheese was just better than ok this time.... spice rubbed pork dinner was super tough and that was a big disappointment; the fried okra wasn't very good either.  
Service was good, especially since it was so very busy.  All in all: A-OK when in the mood for comfort Americana food.  Just avoid rush hour."}
{"text":"I have come to this restaurant before in the past, but never checked in via Yelp. Today (02/03/18) I really noticed the menu and realized that this place is not meant for people who want healthy options. Yes.....they do replace egg yolks with just egg whites,  but everything else is fattening. 

For example, each meal comes with an option of fried apples, biscuits / gravy, hash brown casserole and grits. Aside from the grits.....these aren't healthy sides. Also....I didn't see any chicken items on the menu (good protein), but I did see bacon, ham, pork and steak (I really don't eat any of these). 

I ended up ordering some type of scrambler on the menu and asked for egg white. Yeah.....I didn't receive the egg whites. I was very disappointed. Instead of causing a fuss, I just ate what was on my plate. I was very unhappy with the service (our waiter kept trying to rush us to order after three minutes of us sitting down). I was also very unhappy on my order and the quality of the food. 

The restaurant was busy and loud. The interior was clean. The last two times in had been at this restaurant,  the service wasn't this bad and the food was good. This experience on 02/03/18, was overall.....bad. 

Based on this, I will never attend this restaurant again. I hope everyone else receives an adequate service and good quality of food. I am not a fan and will never return back to QB again."}
{"text":"This has become my husband's favorite breakfast place so I have now been twice. I ordered something off the whole fixings menu, which is their healthy menu. The problem is, they don't provide you with the actual nutritional value. However, I did enjoy my meal of egg beaters, tomato slices, fruit, turkey bacon and dry whole wheat toast, which I substituted out instead of grits. 

My husband ordered some large breakfast with eggs, grits, gravy, biscuits, hash brown casserole, and ham. He loved it, especially the biscuits and gravy. 

Prices are good too as each entree was about $8. Ambiance was also great with a big fire going. And their shop is fun to browse in and the table games are fun too. 

This is definitely a chain, but a scent more for the price and value."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast. Had the skillet special and it was good. Server didn't really come around for refills till we were finished eating, but was pleasant. The food did come out quickly and was hot."}
{"text":"They have changed the way they make their oatmeal, stopped using REAL maple syrup, pancakes were horrible.  Coffee watered down."}
{"text":"Damn... such a shame.  Was really looking forward to the opening of Cracker Barrel.  I've been following the feeds and waiting for this place to open for months.  Saw on yelp the lines were long and the wait times were 1-2 hours, I should've looked closer at the reviews prior to coming. 

Went on a weds around 12:30, expected a wait which we were quoted 20-30 minutes which was roughly accurate, no issues there as it was expected.  Upon getting our named called for a table, we were told we'd be next up which took another 10 minutes, no biggie.  

Seating seems to be fairly cramped and for literally building this place from scratch I have no idea why they limited the tables the way they did, but it is what it is, not my call.

So on to the actual experience, somehow we seemed to be \"lucky\" enough to be there while they were training some new hires, not just one or two, but we got three all in our little section that were following around someone experienced.  Doesn't seem all that bad at first, but we ended up with 6 people standing by our table every time we turned our head along with a creepy manager, bus boys and whatever other server happened to be walking by at the moment.  Not the most pleasant experience but I'd suck it up if the food was good..... 

so on to the food... Having been to locations in other states, I had maybe an unreasonable expectation?  Being a chain I'd expect some type of quality control would have already been done to make sure the food coming out would be up to the company's standards, unfortunately I vastly over-estimated that.  Fiance got the pecan pancakes, super dense, watched her struggle to cut them, ended up eating one of them before just saying \"f it\" and was over it.  The menu and every other location pancakes typically will come with butter on them, hell even denny's, IHOP, Black Bear or any other place that serves breakfast will typically give you butter on the pancakes....The menu even advises \"real butter\" comes with it...  apparently not here though.  Ended up asking for some and instead of giving a nice little side dish with some they give her ice cold tiny packets meant for biscuits.   Oh well... 

So on to my meal... ended up getting the special of the day \"chicken pot pie\" with a biscuit and cornbread ... having eaten at another location in the past, I was hoping for the best.  The chicken in it wasn't bad, wasn't anything special either though unfortunately.  The broth/gravy, not sure what it's called in there was pretty much non-existent, there was a nice layer of grease and oil though on the bottom that apparently was meant to take it's place.  I've never had a chicken pot pie like that anywhere else and I'm fairly certain there's a good reason for that.  Feel like I've had better one's in my younger days from the grocery store.  On the plus side the biscuit was actually pretty good!!  That was the one bright spot of the entire experience!  Cornbread was dry and after a bite I was more than happy to not have another piece of it.  

So after finishing our meal and joking around about how we won't come back anytime soon, we go to pay for our meal.  The cashier asked how it was and me being a smartass jokingly said \"at least the biscuit was good!\" ... she took that as me complaining and said she'd get a manager as the only way they'd get better would be to hear the complaints, tried to tell her it's alright and I didn't mean anything really by it.... that really just feel on deaf ears and she called for the manager anyway.... *sigh* oh well, he's been called, screw it... So he finally comes up and my fiance who is usually super quiet and won't complain, voiced up about the pancakes.   I was shocked when the manager ended up being quite a dick about the situation.  Apparently in the cluster of the people around us he had come by and asked how our food was (really don't remember this, but oh well)... So apparently because she didn't voice it to him at that time, it's her fault the food was bad??  She even responded that she doesn't like to complain (which is very true)... Either way, was met with extreme attitude from this guy... They ended up comping the pancakes without much issue, really wasn't the expected result.  Honestly would've been happy just paying what we ordered and getting out of there.

Anyway... TL;DR version.... Not worth it to go.  No quality control over the food, it's just bad compared to the other location. After 2 months of being open servers don't appear to know what they are doing yet.  Manager is a dick."}
{"text":"Seriously! Who doesn't love Cracker Barrel?
I bet you know what you are going to order before you even get to the parking lot.
Everything I ordered was good.
The only thing is that they would have refilled my drink once... That would have gotten them five stars."}
{"text":"tl;dr - Trust me: There is nothing on the menu here that is worth the wait times, extremely slow staff, and the inconsiderate management. 

I have managed to sit and eat here twice since it has opened, only because the first time we came only 30 minutes after they opened and an hour and a half before they closed the second time. If you visit anytime between those hours, you're completely wasting your time. 

First off, the food is just okay. I cannot imagine waiting longer than 2 minutes for a table here. It is not anything you can't get at another restaurant chain or make yourself. Second, the wait staff is extremely slow, so you better ask for EVERYTHING you need the first time they come to your table because you'll never see them again until they bring you your check. Third, don't even bother placing a to-go order. I recently placed an order at 9am, was told it would be ready in 20 minutes, arrived at 9:25am and had to wait another HOUR before my food came out. I was in the process of asking for a refund when my food finally came out (or I would have just left). I politely spoke to the manager, just to give him a heads up on the lack of efficiency his team has in regard to to-go orders, and he literally laughed it off and didn't bother to accommodate me for the inconvenience.  
 
I will not be returning to any Cracker Barrel location."}
{"text":"Very crowded but was seated as promised within 35minutes. The staff was very nice and attentive! I did not give it 5 stars because of the wait..but the food was great and I will go again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The girl that served us messed up our order not once or twice or three times but FOUR times.... we had to ask the manager to please just get our order right after waiting about an hour for our food to get \"fixed\". We almost just left but decided to give them chance. Our waitress only came by once to see if we needed anything so we had to ask other waitress for refills etc... the waitress came back and gave us our check and said she's really sorry about her mess up and have us a discount... we flipped the check over and there was no discount and the manager didn't seem to care to offer us anything either. Disappointed in this location... the food didn't seem very fresh either. Sorry but I won't be going back"}
{"text":"I don't understand the restaurant cum knickknack store combination.  It's just bizarre.  (Mimi's Cafe and Apple Farm in SLO, you are guilty of this, too!)"}
{"text":"Great place.. Good service and awesome food.. Love the fried apples.. The eggs were done just right...My waiter Vicki was the best.. And the price affordable... Nice environment .."}
{"text":"Love this place, We NEED one in Cali. I had the meatloaf lunch special and it was by far the best meatloaf that I've ever had in a Restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife love Cracker Barrels for some reason. I have no idea why. I mean the food is ok I guess. She thinks it is awesome though. I would only have placed 3 stars but she really likes the place so it gets 4 stars because of that. 

Now that I think of it, I probably would have given it 4 stars based on our most recent visit. The waitress was spot on. Even with her fake southern accent. (I think it was fake... I mean it is Arizona. Maybe she is from someplace else though) 

About 7 to 10 miles away was another Cracker Barrel with a 30 min wait. This is the last Cracker Barrel you will hit if you are taking the 10 back to California. (No Cracker Barrels in California. No White Castles either... which is sad but whatever this is a Cracker Barrel review)

I got what I always get when I come here. Fried Catfish. Sometimes I may switch it up with Country Fried Chicken but not this time. My wife is a breakfast person, so I think that is why she likes to eat here. She got the Uncle Herschel's breakfast with the Fried Catfish. (copy cat) I also got a side of dumplings though the side doesn't have the chicken... you would think they could throw in a few pieces of chicken though. 

My catfish was good as always. No complaints here. The one thing that kept happening during the meal was that the servers or pick up crews kept dropping dishes. It was getting so out of hand...that everytime it happened there was an applause at one point. 

If you like Cracker Barrel make a note of this place on your drive back to California though. It is the last one you will see until you come back to Arizona."}
{"text":"Paddy and Manager Paul are awesome! I initially started frequenting Cracker Barrel for the southern cafeteria style food - though I must admit it is more than pleasant  to receive good customer service as a side dish to my meal -  like the kind that I received from Paddy (server) and Paul (Manager) yesterday. Nothing is better but I hear the pecan pie gives it  good chase..."}
{"text":"Sasha the gal that served us was wonderful and really showed us what good customer service is. Thank you for a great experience at Cracker Barrel. The food is always delicious. I didn't take any pictures that I would normally post on my Instagram (herblopez71) thanks again"}
{"text":"OMG!!! Just left here with THE MOST BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Alejandra was just ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!! She was so courteous and helpful the entire time we were there!!! We never had to wait or ask for refills napkins etc because as soon as something was needed BOOM she was there!!! Just wanted to give a quick shout out to Ms Alejandra and tell her THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!! CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"My friends love Cracker Barrell's breakfast. I told myself I would check this place out someday, somehow.  

Fastforward 7 years later...

I bookmarked Cracker Barrel when I planned my trip to Scottsdale for Christmas. 

What a cute restaurant. The restaurant looks so cozy and it has adorable store. 

Holiday sampler n' cinnamon biscuit breakfast ($8.49): basically sunrise sampler with no additional charge for the cinnamon drop biscuit. It came with 2 eggs, hashbrown casserole, thick cut Hickory-smoked bacon, country ham & smoked sausage, coarse-ground grits, fried apples, buttermilk biscuit & gravy and double-glazed cinnamon drop biscuit. I am seriously full just thinking about it. 

The eggs were perfectly cooked, the sausage and hashbrown casserole were delicious. I liked both my biscuit with gravy and cinnamon drop biscuit. You have the choice of country style ham or sugar cured ham. We got both of them and I honestly can't remember which one I liked more. 

The service was great, friendly and helpful!

Take your check to the cashier @ the store to pay for your meal. I liked exploring the cute country store. 
 
4 stars!!

Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"wanted to try this place of course we came hungry service was so bad we waited 25 minutes finally got someones attention waited another 10 minutes for a menu by that time i was pissed so we got up and had to talk to the manager gave us a gold card comp cause it was under my eXes name still haven't used it I don't know if I wanna come back they said food was good but...."}
{"text":"Likely your best bet for breakfast in this general area for now - which means there is an opportunity here for a locally owned breakfast spot. Lots of small inexpensive spaces for lease in the plaza right next door."}
{"text":"You know, every time I come here, whether it be breakfast or dinner, it's never that great..... the wait is long, the food is bland. I WANT to like this place but nothing has wowed me...."}
{"text":"Long lines, long wait times, and kinks are to be expected with a grand opening. However, this particular location needs to do a better job at hiring servers. My server had the worst attitude. He barely came to our table, all of our food didn't come out, drinks were not refilled and we literally had to get up out of our seats to find him. Once we tracked him down and told him what the issues were, his attitude got worse. Needless to say, I didn't leave him a tip. You don't have to like your job, but at least be courteous to people. I think I'll continue to drive to St. George to visit the friendly people in that location."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel never disappoints us. Consistently good food and great service. Portions are huge and there is a wide variety of comfort food offerings available."}
{"text":"Both happy and a little disappointed. The value for the portion sizes was fantastic. The ham was delicious and most of our food was cooked well. The grits came out cold. Our server took them back. When she returned, the dishes were hot, but the grits were still room temperature. I'm guessing microwave. I don't like microwaved food, so I didn't eat the grits (plus they were still cold). Both of my daughters' eggs came out fine, but mine were undercooked. Scrambled eggs, raw in the center. Gross. Bacon was fine, hash brown casserole was amazing, biscuits and gravy were good. Server had way too many tables. We asked for things three times and she forgot, the girl who brought my biscuits dropped one on the floor and said she'd bring another (she never came back, we had to ask the server). The tables were clean, hostess was great, we got seated quickly, bathrooms were clean, store was well organized and clean, paying our check was fast and pleasant. I'll give it another shot, but if I have a similar issue with the food, we won't be returning a third time. All food should come out HOT and fully cooked."}
{"text":"Finally after the wait I went there for the first time... not very busy and was seated quickly. The server was there minutes after we were seated she was great. The food took a while to arrive and when it did it was cold... and I had to remind the runner what I ordered and that she forgot everything. (Biscuits and gravy, apples, hash browns) when she finally brought out the rest of my order that was already cold (eggs and ham) were now dried out even more and almost unfit to eat. For $27.00 for breakfast and having to wait a long time for the meal to arrive (and it wasn't busy) I didn't enjoy it at all.
I've traveled and ate Cracker Barrel all over the states and never had a bad meal until now, what a disappointment, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Have zero issues with new location. Those complaining about the wait time need to calm down, they've been open a week. 

Food was fantastic, service too. 

Will go back often."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of Cracker Barrel.  I think last night has changed my mind. I don't usually eat comfort foods much because honestly it's not really that healthy for you but for a once in awhile place I could do this. The mean was delicious. I had the fried shrimp and my sides were a side salad, Cole slaw and the sweet potato mash which I ordered for my friend. ( I don't like sweet potatoes). My friend had the smothered turkey with Mac and cheese and green beans. The star for me was the homemade biscuits and the thousand island dressing I had on my salad. First the dressing. They have to make their own because it was the best I've ever tasted. Nothing from a bottle is that good. Now the biscuits. So good. Freshly baked, melt in your mouth goodness. I wanted to ask for some to go. Our waiter was very nice and took good care of us. My friend will want the to come back with here and I will."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location. The staff were warm and inviting and the food was fantastic. I ordered my usual, the grandpa's country fried breakfast and let me tell you, it was cooked with love. I have a hard time remember when I've had this meal cooked so well.

Our waitress was a real sweetheart. She was very helpful and kind. She definitely made a great visit even better. 

If you're in the area, check them out!"}
{"text":"If you are a pancake lover then this is the place for you! This place has one of the best breakfasts you'll find in this area. Hands down! They not only have a great breakfast menu but their dinner menu is pretty good as well. The staff has always been very friendly and helpful during my visits (except for this one time where I thought the waitress was drunk)."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this Cracker Barrel and it showed much improvement since my last time here. The hostess was very friendly and quickly seated us.  The server was very prompt and friendly and expedited our food at a very rapid rate. Our waiter also provided suggestions and ways for us to save on our bill which was very nice and unexpected because as you know most server's don't try to help you save money and that was very pleasant. The food arrived and it was hot. We ordered the livers with green beans and fried apples I had the chicken and dumpling macaroni and cheese and a side salad with baby carrots. The food came out piping hot fresh and delicious I can't say anything was wrong with our meal or our experience here at this Cracker Barrel. I thoroughly enjoyed our time here and our conversation and the staff.  I would like to return for future visits."}
{"text":"Great place to come if your looking for country style cookin'. The food is always good when I come. Keeping in mind just like any establishment there will be some people that love it and some people that hate it. This is a chain restaurant, so everything is fairly the same at anyone you visit. I have never been to a Cracker Barrel and have not had to wait, that is the common knowledge of coming to a place like this. I personally checked in online and when I arrived they said it would be about 5 minutes. If you don't want to wait I would suggest doing so and going in prepared. 

The entire staff was very friendly and very accommodating. The manager I noticed was walking around and checking in with all tables, which in my eyes is amazing customer service! Keep it up! 

I ordered the Sunday special which was 2 chicken Breast with a deep fried batter and 2 sides. It was very good, and for the price point for the portion size, I was very impressed! 

I will defiantly be back to eat another time!"}
{"text":"Upon occasion one becomes sufficiently inured to culinary wrongdoings that just having it done right lifts one's spirit as well as the rating of the restaurant.
This was just such an occasion!
On each of two recent visits we both ordered the same things!
I got their chef salad, the surprise being that none of the meats came from some deli supplier, but rather featured off-the-bone turkey breast, and ham, and house-made bacon crumbles, and rather than a slice or two of boiled egg, two deviled egg halves.
Cheese shreds were swapped for a smallish cheddar wedge.
The only real disappointment were the saltines that served as the starch accompaniment, a weak substitute for the fresh corn muffins served to my wife with her entree. 
I might have enjoyed just a bit more protein, but were a choice required, the quality of the proteins supplied more than made up for the quantity.
My wife got their pot roast dinner both times, liked their mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, broccoli, et al, and et all!
P.S. when asked they will happily swap your crackers for corn muffins or buttermilk biscuits!"}
{"text":"Came to Cracker Barrel to get breakfast for dinner (BFD). The hostess only gave us dinner menus so we asked our server for breakfast menus. I ordered the Sunrise Sampler which has two eggs, grits, hash brown casserole, fried apples, bacon, ham, sausage, and biscuits & gravy. I requested no grits or gravy. The server said I could sub a pancake if I also wanted to swap out the apples or hash browns. It was tempting, but I passed on the offer. It took quite a long time to get our food, but our server was very nice about it. My plate also included an unexpected cinnamon bun, which I brought home for another day. The food was alright. Eggs were cooked pretty much as I asked (scrambled, well done). The hash brown casserole was good, but I picked out the onions. The biscuits were good with some butter & jelly. The ham tasted a little \"piggy\" as I would describe it, so I only tried a bite. I did not try the sausage patty. Perused the gift shop after dinner but didn't buy anything. Overall, BFD was meh... it could have been better."}
{"text":"Coming from the south I wasn't expecting the same quality and taste here in Vegas but it was fantastic!  Food fabulous, service outstanding and ambience fantastic. Our new home away from home!!!"}
{"text":"Great comfort food. I recommend the country style chicken. You can't go wrong with the sides. I like their fried okra, mac n cheese and country style green beans. And don't forget to wash it down with sweet tea. Melany our waitress was the best. Friendly, personable, and knew just when we needed something. (Refills, extra napkins, to go boxes). Also love the country store. They have great unique gift ideas and fun candy and toys for the kids."}
{"text":"I had stopped going to Cracker Barrel in the last state I lived in because the restaurant was not kept up well, and the service was terrible. But I will be back to THIS location! We went because my daughter loves their pancakes, so I thought we'd take a chance. The restaurant looks like all the others, but this one was very clean and well maintained. The service was AWESOME. Our waitress (I cannot remember her name - I'm so sorry), was an older lady, who I was told had been there for some time. She was amazing. Took our drink orders as soon as we sat down, and was back in a jiff to take our order. Food arrived promptly, and I never had an empty glass! I was so impressed, I left a 40% tip. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been to the cracker barrel in St George Utah. This one is just as awesome as that one. I've waited a really really long time for cracker barrel to come to Vegas. With this location being fairly new, the crew seemed to be on their game unlike other reviews I have seen. Our waitress Diane was attentive to our table as well as her others. She had our drinks filled when they started getting low and was on her game when it came to our orders. To me it seems like they have this location in order. Can't wait for the Craig and I15 location to open since I live on that side of the valley. Keep it up Cracker Barrel. Vegas welcomes you with open arms."}
{"text":"I had been anxiously awaiting the opening of Cracker Barrel in Las Vegas since February 2016 - when the Cracker Barrel in St. George alerted me that a Las Vegas location was coming soon. Once it opened, I heard about the long lines and decided to wait until now to check them out.

My friends and I arrived around 5:15 p.m. on a Friday evening and the wait time was minimal (maybe 5 minutes max). The hostess was decent, but I was just thankful to be seated. 

Our server seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. While I can appreciate prompt service, I know when someone wants to quickly turn over a table. Regardless, our food came out promptly. We were served warm buttery biscuits, but failed to serve us their famous apple butter on the side. Two of my friends ordered the (cod) fish and chips, which included coleslaw and fries. The portions were enormous! Another friend ordered the chicken fried steak and it included three sides. I had the Old-timers breakfast - 2 eggs, 3 slices of turkey bacon, cheesy grits, and a side of the hashbrown casserole. Their idea of cheesy grits is taking plain grits and throwing some cheddar cheese on top. I mixed it myself and doctored it up with some S&P. The hashbrown casserole was extremely crunchy on top and lukewarm. Once you get past the tough top, it's rather tasty. My egg beaters were supposed to be scrambled hard with cheese, but it resembled a small omelet. My eggs were very bland too. 

We were celebrating two of our friend's birthdays and this was the first of my four pals. Their first impression of Cracker Barrel was not positive, but I assured them that this is not how they typically do things at Cracker Barrel. 

Before long, we had our checks. Our party of five were in and out in under 60 minutes.

This location is in dire need of some country cooks and good old fashioned Southern hospitality."}
{"text":"I love this place, rocking chairs for your wait, shopping before you eat, comfort food...it is woman's dream restaurant. Great for families, plenty of food for the price, great service. Although I will say I have a lot of crap that I bought at cracker barrel and have since either tossed or donated."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great'! 1st time here
Had the country boy breakfast 
It was delicious! Our server was polite & fast 
We got seated quickly & it wasn't packed 
Would most definitely recommend coming here :) PS they don't serve monster 
I just brought one lol"}
{"text":"This place is always on point during the middle of the week. Trying to get in here on the weekends is difficult due to the location. Bit it's fefinitslky worth it. The foood is always delicious, hot and fresh. My favorite is their chicken fried steak bit my son loved their maple.bacon burger. The pot roast here is amazing too. This comfort food will make you wanna unbutton your top button and take a nap for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to many cracker barrels and often enjoy the fact that they serve breakfast all day. We recently went on a Sunday. We anticipated a wait (which there was) and walked around the cramped store for about 35 minutes until our name was called. 

Our waitress was nice and was quick to greet us and take our order. My main hang up is the quality of the food. My hashbrown casserole was room temperature and I only got one piece of bacon. I asked our waitress about this and she apologized, saying I should've received three pieces. She then brought out the other two pieces but, I mean, how did my plate (with ONE piece of bacon) even make it to the table?

In the past, my trips to this location have been hit or miss. This trip was underwhelming, to say the least. I like Cracker Barrel, but this location is (in my opinion) lacking."}
{"text":"I went on monday with my girlfriend and friend. The place is decorated really neat. We were seated quickly without wait. Waiter was friendly and took our order and made a few suggestions.  The food was bland and not so good. I made a trip to the bathroom before desert. My girlfriend said it was much better in North Carolina but this will be my only visit to this restaurant chain."}
{"text":"Great food, very long wait.
We had breakfast and lunch dishes between all of us and the food was good.  BUT it took 4 hours from the time we put our name at the front to the end.  NOT worth the wait.  Our server did not know the menu that well and forgot little things.
Wait till they have been there longer so the wait is not so long.  Breakfast there is delicious."}
{"text":"I gave them a 3star cause of the filth in the bathrooms.  I got there at 6:30am They opened at 6am. And had to go to the bathroom and this is the caked on crap I see.  It's like they never clean the bathrooms. That's like weeks of caked on dust and dirt. I Donno why but most companies require them to be completely cleaned every few hours Daily. This place was still nasty from weeks b4.  Ya maby they cleaned just the toilets but nothing else. On the other hand the food was nice as always.  I haven't been in their kitchen but I hope a more cleanly group of staff work back there then whoever cleans the bathrooms."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've gone to a Cracker Barrel in several years and probably the last for several more years. I notice that most of the high ratings were from those who had breakfast there. I had lunch and was so disappointed."}
{"text":"I love CB. None in California so I come here everytime I come to AZ. Unfortunately food cold today. Out of pie so they said they would put in oven but it takes an hour to cook!!! Now I am checking out and finding my bill is incorrect. Wow..."}
{"text":"My wife and & flew into Phoenix, AZ from Seattle, WA and my sister picked us up at the airport. Our first request was to eat breakfast/lunch at Cracker Barrel since the DO NOT EXIST in Washington State.

We love this place. You usually get way more food than you can eat and the price is right. So many good meal choices.

My favorite is Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast with Chicken Fried Chicken and Hashbrown Casserole"}
{"text":"I'm so glad there is a Cracker Barrel near Carowinds. I love going with family and enjoy their fresh coffee and home cooked meals. It's always a fun trip to eat here. I even love the gift shop too. I always get Grandpa's Breakfast. I also ask for cheese in my eggs and hash browns."}
{"text":"INTRO:
I got the blueberry pancakes. My partner got the french dip.


PROS:
-The store has cool merchandise for kids & adults.
-My pancakes were moist and blueberries weren't sour.
-Waiter asked if I wanted to add cheese in my eggs. Most breakfast restaurant servers haven't asked me that before.
-My partner's french dip was delicious. Creamy & flavorful.
- Edges of pancakes were crispy.
-Server was friendly but didn't ask what kind of pancakes I wanted. He talked too fast. I had to sneak in really quick that I didn't want regular pancakes.


CONS:
-I like my pancakes moist and crispy but these pancakes were a little too crispy and greasy. I'm guessing they used too much butter. 
-They didn't give us military discount like Denny's does."}
{"text":"When I walk into Cracker Barrel, I love the smell of burning wood spewing from the chimney.  I think this is one of the only restaurants I have dined at that has a large, burning fireplace.  It's so cozy.

Well, on today's visit, I called ahead for some fish fry.  I ordered the cod with fries, cole slaw, biscuit, and cornbread.  It was really delicious.  Since I took it to go, the breading on the fish was a little mushy by the time I actually ate it, which was about 20 minutes later.  However, the taste of the fish and the batter was delicious.  The sides made this dish very filling.  Actually, I couldn't quite finish the cornbread muffin, even though it was yummy.

While I was here, I was thinking about my boss who is on FMLA and staying with her parents one street from my house.  Christmas is coming up, so I decided to buy her a couple gifts and a Christmas card to cheer her up.  I knew that once I got back to the office my co-workers would pitch in a couple bucks and sign their names on the card.  This worked out as expected.  Also, Cracker Barrel offers free gift wrapping!  That was an added bonus.

I've eaten here on several occasions and it's classic American fare that's always good.  If you want an expensive rocking chair, this is the place.  They have kids' rocking chairs for $79!

Overall, I really like this place, but I don't visit often enough."}
{"text":"Visiting from California on busines. Came here on thanksgiving day and ordered the thanksgiving meal. Came with turkey, dressing, a slice of ham and two sides you can pick. I went with mashed potatoes and hash brown casserole. Got cornbread and homemade biscuits. Everything was good. Our waiter was attentive. For 10.99 you get more than what you pay for. I stuffed myself! I asked for boxes, I wasn't going to leave my leftovers. It was too good. Then my waiter asked what kind of pie I wanted....what! Pie too!!! Why don't I have one of these by my house???sad.  The Pumpkin pie was  on point! Like my mom makes."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Cracker Barrel but rarely get to go there because it's far away from where I live. They need to put one near the Biltmore. Anyways, managed to get out there tonight. Good time. I loved the food however, the portion sizes were a bit small in my opinion. The store is always great. We plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"The food was not good. The biscuits were hard and cold as a rock. The \"grits\" looked more like baby food. The service was too rushed. I felt like I had to eat fast. The check was served to me with my food as if to say \"thank you for ordering and thank you for leaving\". I won't go back."}
{"text":"I was stoked about Cracker Barrel, cuz we dont have this type of nostalgia in CA, but it was a cool lil gimmick to hit up when i was in Charlotte.

Can't beat the rocking chairs outside and little games on the table to entertain me while i wait.

i was pleasantly surprised they had a vanilla yogurt with pineapple pieces, topped with a granola and dried cranberries.  

not very vegetarian friendly, lol so choose carefully if you want wanna eat any faces.

the store was also super cute with all its random stuff and old school candies. picked up a zero bar, and some moon pies, =D"}
{"text":"Poor service...ordered to go multiple times from this location and have had to wait for my order or to pay for 20-30 mins. The manager is very rude and condescending as well"}
{"text":"Went there for a bday breakfast on Sunday 02.15.15 service was good, food was tasty, but I had an issue with a foreign object in my meal.. Told the manager and he was very nice about it, and took care my bill. I really liked how he was so nice and really seemed to care about the customers. I will go back, this place has good customer service. Thank you Manager"}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Bathrooms could be better."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here this morning. We usually would go to Dean's down the street but I've never been to Cracker Barrel so I thought I'd give it a try. I love the shop when you first walk in. Super cute! Glitter and shiney stuff everywhere so I was excited to shop after breakfast. My guy and I were seated and told our server would be right with us to take our drink order. We sat there so long that I purposely made eye contact with every server that came our way. Nothing! Completely ignored by the staff yet a couple that came in way after us were sat across from us and taken care of right away. After lots more time passed I finally stopped a server that had made eye contact with me several times mind you and asked him if he could please find our server because no one had acknowledged us for so long. The server (in a surprised tone) says he'll take our order if we are ready. Ummmm...I asked for service, which meant I'm ready and have been for a long time. The food wasn't as great as I expected. The coffee was so weak that two creamers turned it super white. The silver ware was covered in soap and water stains. Needless to say, I will not be going back and did not spend a penny in the shop before I left. I'm sticking to Dean's down the street, they have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Good, but nothing great! Good service the food seems like something I could make better at home. Everyone from the South seems to love it. Maybe I'm just missing something..."}
{"text":"I dont visit the Barrel very often because my spouse is not a fan. But I do enjoy the breakfast. I see that the breakfast menu has been expanded and the choices dont look bad.
The coffee can be improved.
I do like this place and will give it 5 stars once I taste this meal....LoL"}
{"text":"The biscuits. If there is ONE thing that keeps me coming back to Cracker Barrel, it would have to be the biscuits. 

I grew up in the midwest, and biscuits with sausage gravy and grits was something I came to enjoy a lot. I know there are a lot of \"grit-haters\" out there, and some people who don't like biscuits and gravy. That's fine because you can just get the biscuits with butter and jam or apple butter. They're really simple biscuits, but probably the closest to simple biscuit perfection I have come across: buttery all over with a nice browned crown, slightly crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Mmmm... 

The prices have increased over the past 10 years (what hasn't?), but they're still reasonable and you can get a filling breakfast with unlimited coffee for around $10. My wife likes the apple cider that comes in a frozen mug. That costs a bit more than a cup of coffee, and there are no free refills, but she says it is totally worth it. 

On this visit, as with most in recent memory, our server was friendly and efficient, and my coffee cup was never empty. Yeah, I am a fan."}
{"text":"I feel like the food and service is lacking bc it's always packed.   Always go to the Utah one and food is always good and delicious. Service is always great.   Las Vegas location.  Not so great.  Long waits.  Then more waiting to order.  Then more waiting for your food.  And then the food isn't the same as the other locations.  Maybe once it slows down the food will be up to par."}
{"text":"Picked up an order to go and the quality of food that was sent out of the kitchen was not good enough to even feed my dog. Needless to say when calling back and talking to them they really weren't surprised"}
{"text":"Came here on Father's Day, waited an hour to be seated which was expected. I've been to Cracker Barrel a bunch of times. Today I opted for the Sunday chicken dinner special with macaroni and cheese. It didn't disappoint. We had a large group and almost everyone else ordered breakfast with no complaints. Only downside to coming here is no booze."}
{"text":"This place has great breakfast and dinner meals! I typically come more for their breakfast and can eat it anytime of the day! Be sure to understand what comes with your meal because they tend to give you a lot of food for your buck. Other then that, the service was decent, had to wait long periods for our waiter to refill drinks, and to check up on us."}
{"text":"So far this had been the best CB I have been to. The wait is shorter than the one on bell and 101. I love the cheesy hashbrown casserole and it is highly recommended. It is always pretty loud in CB, but is still enjoyable. I love to go Sundays after or before church."}
{"text":"I love this place! The last time we ate here was while in Virginia.  I'm happy to see them moving to the west coast. Services was excellent! I suggest registering online if you're going on a weekend. We did it about 20 min before arrival and once there we were seated and ordering drinks within 10. Brit was great! She was quick, helpful and awesome. Rather than having us order separate items as we were doing she told us of a meal we could order that had everything we wanted. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a hearty breakfast. Very family friendly as well."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have heard nothing but good things so we wanted to try then out . We showed up at 11:45 am and we're called to be seated at 11:55  which was not bad at all for how busy they were . After about 2 mins of waiting to be seated . The hostess sat us instead of waiting for someone to come get us . We sat down and waited , 15 mins later still no one said \" hi be right with you \" or anything of the sort .  No drinks were taken ... all tables around us were being serviced . 
We ended up walking out ..."}
{"text":"On a day I thought it would be almost impossible to get a seat at any restaurant, I then decided what would I like to eat and from where. My favorite is chicken fried steak and it is absolutely the best here, done like down south. The day I decided to do this adventure was Sunday May 13th, 2018' Mother's Day! Well, upon my personal thoughts of it being impossible, I walked in looked at a few things (the cast iron skillets), then used the bathroom and washed my hands walked up to the counter said one and was seat right away. Greeted shortly after from the waitress with a happy Sunday to you-which made my day! She then proceeded to see what I would like to drink and order, I asked for a mocha plus a few minutes. When she returned I order. And on the way out was thanked for coming and told to have a great day by a waitress that wasn't even taking care of me, nice place and nice people!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at this location tonight. The food as always was good. However the service, was lacking. We waited 8 minutes to be greeted. When we were greeted we saw that our server had walked past us numerous times, and didn't bother to let us know she'd be with us soon. No drink refills the whole meal and we had to ask other servers for the boxes and the check. Our server didn't seem busy in the least. However, when we finished our meal and went to pay, the cashier asked us how our meal had been. And I honestly told her \"eh it was okay\". She asked why, I told her how the last 40 min had passed and she called a manager up to speak with us. We explained again and the sweet manager apologized profusely and took care of our meal, even when we insisted that it wasn't necessary. Overall we were pleased with how the situation was handled and will most likely be back because of that."}
{"text":"Decided on a late dinner, picked the wrong place to go.
Cracker Barrel has fallen like all the rest of the restaurants that we all remember as kids of the 70s and 80s.
Service here was lax to say the least, got coffee refilled once only after asking.
My wifes plate looked as if the cook was ready to go home and did not care enough to even make it look edible.
Portions are a joke, this looks like a kids plate.
Sorry to see another mainstay of my childhood go away.
This will be our last visit."}
{"text":"This is a horrible place for breakfast. They have a high turnover which means the cooks in the back prepare the food differently and they have inexperienced people. Management is a joke, the lady goes to you as if to resolve any issues but she doesn't know anything about restaurant business or customer service. If you want to waste money and get bad service with undercooked food then go on in."}
{"text":"They did good service I would give them five stars but they need to allow choclete milk refills and that's all I gotta say"}
{"text":"Ahh The Cracker Barrel, a family tradition on long road trips that are a source of great childhood memories.  That is where I should have kept them.

Tried the chicken and dumplings, decent food but nothing I would seek out again.  Hash-brown casserole was the best side and the corn bread was alright."}
{"text":"No good. Everything tasted like it was either frozen or had been sitting around for hours and dished up. Serving sizes were pretty good. Everything tasted very bland however and had no taste. Was pretty disappointed in the quality."}
{"text":"A trip to Arizona is no complete with out at least one meal at the Cracker Barrel.  Whether it's breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you can't go wrong as everything on their menu is scrumptious!  I think the best way to describe the food is good old fashion American.  With items like Biscuits  & Gravy, Meatloaf, Chicken and Biscuits, Grits, ...

The wait is never unbearable, and they have a cool little store to look around in while you wait for them to call your name.  That's not to mention their fleet of rocking chairs, and benches to sit on, in addition to simple board games like chess, and checkers to make the wait go by faster."}
{"text":"Hour wait just to get in then horrible service, they seem to be more interested in getting as many people through the door than taking care of them.  Food is not very appealing to the eye let alone to taste. Saw other customers get seated then get ignored by the staff.  After telling a supervisor about the shitty food she tried to tell me country cooking takes some getting used too, are you kidding me!! I grew up on country cooking, cracker barrel is just horrible at reheating frozen slop!! Will never return to this horrible gimmicky chain!!"}
{"text":"Lots of people!  Big wait.  Food was good and not so good.  The concept of a runny egg yolk and firm whites are only a concept here!  Myranda, our waitress is LOVELY, cheerful and tried her best to make sure our order was done as well as it could be.

Bacon:  Crisp v petrified 
Toast:  \"no butter please\". Oops, too bad
Potato casserole:  perfect
Pancake:  yummmm

I will always come back because sometimes it's perfect"}
{"text":"I have found Cracker Barrel to be consistent in providing customers with good food and friendly service in several states.  No matter how busy, they manage to serve you in timely manner.  But make no mistake, their secret is out so they are in high demand.  Going at off-peak times is helpful if you want to escape waiting."}
{"text":"This is a new location so they are still working out the bugs. Have been to this location twice. Both times did not have to wait to be seated. Menu the same as any other CB. Drinks were ordered , promptly arrived. Wait person was congenial and friendly. Took our order, suggested some sides. Mashed potatoes creamy ..fried apples good..took some home.  Coffee and cold drinks promptly refilled. All n all both experiences were positive..I would go back when I want comfort food."}
{"text":"Greasy FLOORING in the dinning area!!! Please be careful.. I fell down and hit the floor before I knew what happened.  Management seemed to be very new Or not aware of what to do if anything happens like this...AND he Never offered to even pay for my dinner.  He took my name and #. That manager never called. Someone for the office in Tennessee called me to check and see what had happened. So I explain. He wished me well and made sure he had my address... Days later I got mail from the Tennessee office.. a 25.00 gift card was in it . WOW! Thanks so much!!! 
BUT  MY BAD. I still have swollen knees and I'm hobbling around. Maybe if this happens to you ... Go to  the hospital and get your self checked out ... I wish I had done that now my knees are still hurting and swollen. Really bad !!! My mistake for being a nice person and not wanting to cause problems."}
{"text":"It's Cracker Barrel standard. Good food at a reasonable price. They know how to cook eggs TO ORDER (which can be something of a rarity). They don't come out over easy or over medium no matter how you actually order them and the ingredients are good for the price. The place gets busy...especially in the winter and fall, but no problem now. If you want a quality breakfast at a good price, stop on in."}
{"text":"First time being there after having heard of so many good things about this place! I liked how the first section of this store has many farm/country style stuff to sell. i would totally love to spend a whole day there buying stuff. When you walk inside, there's the dining section. The interior decor was very country style with many old pictures and stuff on the wall. I ordered the rib eye and it was very well done! Thumbs up! My bf ordered the home style fried chicken - he liked it, I thought it was ok. Our waitress was very friendly as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"....when I asked to have my \"free\" fruit topping for my pancakes on the side they said would have to charge me &2.69...."}
{"text":"My breakfast was disgusting last time. Waits have been so long! Waiter was dull. My eggs were half cooked. Way over priced."}
{"text":"haven't been to a cracker barrel in years.  I ordered a chicken breast sandwich with Monterey Jack cheese and green chili and fries.  first let me say the taste was very good, the sandwich came on sourdough and the bread on bottom of the sandwich was soggy that my sandwich fell apart and it was hard to eat.  But all in all the flavor was a 5 star experience, the server which I do not have her name was very good and attentive without being over bearing and the ambiance was great.  we ordered desert to share (my daughter and I) and we had an apple pie in a bowl with pecans and ice cream and it was huge.  it could feed a family of four.  forgot the name of the desert but would do it again.  I will try this restaurant again if near the neighborhood.  this time I will specify about the bread to make sure it isn't soaking ...."}
{"text":"The food was horrible the cook was a horrible cook I got the bread batter catfish southern green beans mashed potatoes and biscuit. The catfish was half way done n mashed potatoes was cold so I didn't eat my potatoes....it was horrible"}
{"text":"My go to restaurant for country fried chicken!

The grandpas breakfast is my favorite. It comes with an egg, one side and country fried chicken and gravy. Their gravy is my favorite. It's creamy and filled with flavor.

Their sweet tea is another favorite of mine! 

Can't go wrong with the entrees at Cracker Barrel!

The service is always fast and everyone is always friendly. 

Affordable and just good!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Cracker Barrel?!

The country fried chicken, country fried steak, sweet tea. The white gravy is my favorite. Makes the food taste so good. 

The service is always fast and the food is always good! 

The country store is always fun to look through and all
Of the candles smell so good."}
{"text":"My Hubby loves this place. He brought me here to try it once, and ever since we've been coming here! I love French toast so I order the \"Momma French toast plate\" something like that.. It's a pretty good portion I never get to finish it! My hubby gets the chicken fried steak and it's pretty good aswell!"}
{"text":"The service was fast, friendly and efficient even though the whole restaurant was slammed. The food came out hot and delicious. Had a great trip here."}
{"text":"Wow, first timer, what a great breakfast!  Everyone was talking about wait, it wasn't bad at all!  The food was great, the prices was awesome and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Never been a big breakfast guy and I vastly prefer lunch and dinner.  My lactose intolerance has a lot to do with that, but time management plays a key factor as well as I usually just need something quick to eat before running out the door to work which limits the amount of breakfast I eat in general.

In planning to visit Arizona to see my Eagles play a terrible game of football against the Cardinals, I was extremely excited to see a Cracker Barrel was located nearby.  Cracker Barrel has this aura surrounding it much like Chick-Fil-A (religious beliefs notwithstanding) in that I hear so many people talk about how much they love it that I've been wanting to try it for quite a while and this seemed like a perfect opportunity.  On the Monday following the game, I decided to go with my dad and brother to visit this location and drown the sorrows of our team's horrible performance in some gravy and egg yolk.  

I get the hype now.  I was actually a little surprised to see a very standard menu full of typical breakfast foods like eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and the like.  I don't know why exactly but I always assumed that they must offer some sort of atypical breakfast fare for people to be as in love with it as they were.  Instead the major decision to be made seems to be in deciding which one of 8 or so combinations of those standard items you want on your plate.  I went with Grandpa's country fried steak breakfast because I hadn't had one in years and it sounded soul-soothing and spirit raising all at once.  It came with some eggs cooked to order (Sunny side up), biscuits with gravy, a choice of hashbrown casserole or fried apples (went with the hash), and a bowl of grits on the side.  

I thought every single item tasted like a very fine version.   The biscuits were warm, fluffy, and deliciously buttery.  The country fried steak was a huge portion completely smothered in a fantastic creamy gravy.  The hashbrown casserole tasted all sorts of cheesy and potato-y and it all went well with the perfectly runny sunny side up eggs.   Yes, I have lactose intolerance, and yes, this was not a well advised meal for me (I apologize to my dad, brother, and anyone who might have come in contact with me for the next several hours after).   The only thing I wasn't too high on was the grits, but I don't really know if I like grits period so I'm not a good judge on that.   

The real reason I think cracker barrel is so popular though is the price.  All that I mentioned above cost I believe $6.95.  Just an absolute steal for the price and the amount of food you get.   Service was impeccable.   Friendly, quick, and quick to bring out refills.  

While cracker barrel couldn't erase the inept offense the Eagles displayed the day before, it helped this fan's morale (and slight hangover) the next morning and comes highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a weeknight a little after 6.  My server was quick to arrive at my table after I had been seated.  Ordered the roast beef dinner that comes with three sides.  

More than an ample amount of food!  Roast beef was good, but i should have requested more gravy for it.  Sides were all good.  Server was prompt and polite.

Good experience."}
{"text":"Went to the Cracker Barrel on Craig Rd on Friday, 11/18- for my birthday. It was 5 of us, my husband, myself and our 3 teens. I had the pot roast which was the best I've ever had!! Hubby had the sirloin. My oldest son had the 1/2 lb bacon cheeseburger, our daughter had Momma's pancakes (which were HUGE) and our youngest son had the chicken tenders. Dinner for all 5 of was under $70!! Great prices and great service!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This is normally my favorite place to get breakfast during the morning lunch or dinner. However, we moved and it was the first time at this location and the food was awful. Pancakes were served to us blackend and burnt. Had to send them back. They had no children cups and my child was served orange juice in a tall glass which of course he spilled. French toast was undercooked. Coke was flat. I really only complained about the pancake and my kid had to eat half of my meal while we waited for a new one to be cooked and brought out. His meal should have been comped but was not. I would not recommend this location for anything other than the gift shop. We will drive the extra miles to eat at the Peoria location next time. Oh, and they are out of broccoli."}
{"text":"The food is ok. If you ever buy anything there dont plan on returning it. They have a melt down.    I came thru the front door and two old lady`s went off on me. Why are you returning your item?? Is it broken? Did you use it? NO! and NO! Im just returning it! After the third degree at the front door. The Nazi guard`s sent me to the cashier. The cashier said is it broken? Did you use it? No and No. Then she started asking questions like. Why dont you like? Whats wrong with it? Do you want a different one? NO!!! Im just returning it. One miniute SIR, I have to get the manager. REALLY! Now all the people be hind me are pissed now. One min turned into 5 mins. The Manager comes over and just looks me up and down. Yes my GOD i have a return!! She says SIr is it broken? Did you use it? Why dont you like it? Do you want a different one? NO  NO NO NO! Its just a return! Then she pulls the item out of the bag. Price tag is still attached and i have a receipt. She looks it over and turns it over. Then she looks inside. She then pulls it close to her face to examine`s it better! OMG The manager says some secret thing to the cashier. The cashier says SIR i need your cedit card and please fill out our paper work. I said to the cashier this is crazy. She said at least we didnt ask for your Drivers License! Wow
Im surprized they didnt ask for my first born!"}
{"text":"Great food, with a fun staff. plus the store in front has plenty of fun affordable items to buy. The Mac & Cheese is bomb, also fried apples and chicken plate i believe it was Apple Cider BBQ Chicken Breast. We'll definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here. We were asked to come back by management because our first experience was a train wreck. Once again they have screwed up my food. I'm kings over it. Don't think I will be back. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"This 'chain store' has been our go to whenever traveling. After singing their praises to friends in Vegas, imagine my husband's and my dismay when virtually everything ordered was room temperature, at best. Yes, they were eager to heat our food and the manager personally served it the second time around, but the damage had already been done. The husband's reaction was \"I'm not impressed. Maybe lunch or supper will be better\". Our friends were impressed with the retail part of the restaurant - thank goodness the trip wasn't a total bust. I know the stores are new here and this particular one was VERY busy, but they desperately need to work on timing. Service was excellent and attentive!"}
{"text":"This was a disaster! 7 people for dinner & all of the sides were either wrong or on the wrong plates. It was not the waiter he was apologetic. The manager gave free desserts for all but her comments & excuses were inappropriate! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"It was okay. My boyfriend hadn't been here in 12 years and I haven't ever been to a cracker barrel so I decided to check it out. He got the BLT sandwich and I got the salmon patties with green beans and steamed broccoli. 

The BLT was huge and said to be satisfying. My green beans tasted like they were from a can and just sautéed with oil and seasoning.. the broccoli tasted like it was frozen, and the patties were nothing special. I was a little disappointed because cracker barrel always has raving reviews. It's just like any other cheap food chain. 

As for service, the waiter was very nice and we got our meals really quick."}
{"text":"Took forever for food to come out. 2nd time here and each time, it took over 1 hour to receive food. Drinks didn't get refilled until we asked for it 30 min later. Great tasting food, just slow service and food preparation."}
{"text":"Good breakfast selection however everything was great until our food came and our food good great until I dug into my food. Eggs were cold and grits were gritty like it was just sitting there. Hopefully next time around our meal will be fresh and hot. Other than that the service was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"They always have the best service, and friendliest staff!! Even during busy weekend breakfast hours, the hostesses, wait staff and bussing staff communicate well and keep the crowd moving in an out. My daughter hit her head on the table and our waitress brought her a bag of ice for her quickly developing goose egg, and even the manager came over to check on her.  

Food here is always great, we've never had any complaints. I don't think I've eve had a bad CB experience anywhere, but we just kinda prefer the staff here. :-)"}
{"text":"Great food again, Grandpa's country fried breakfast with chicken, eggs over easy cooked perfectly, fresh fruit (pineapple & blueberries) instead of potatoes or sugary apples, rye toast instead of biscuits. A really filling breakfast with no guilt afterward.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Overall it wasn't to bad, friendly service and decent food. My pancakes were a little over cooked, tasted like funnel cake. And my country ham biscuit looked like it was thrown together in 30 seconds. Other then that, it was okay. I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Came in with a group of three on a wednesday at 2. The place was empty so we figured we'd be served any minute now.... Still waiting 10 minutes later thinking about where else we'd like to eat but we gave them another 5 minutes to at least bring some water... Needless to say the water never came. We left because we figured if we have to go find a waiter just to get water, how's the food service going to be?

Moral of the story - We NEVER saw a server once even though the place was dead."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is a chain yes but they serve up that good home cookin food just fine. This CB has it all. A great store plus a great staff make for a great time with friends and family. 

I always go straight for the breakfast menu. The sampler platter always hits the spots. CB has awesome pancakes. Crispy on the outside and nice and gooey on the inside. Plus the little syrups are too cool and easy to take home for leftovers. 

This location has never done me wrong. Plus you're sure to find something in the store for a gift or for yourself."}
{"text":"It would be a nightmare to manage one of these places, it seems like every time we visit it's busy. Not that it's a bad thing! Holly was not our server but saved the day by recognizing no one had stopped by our table yet... So we ordered and enjoyed the food and sides as usual, very consistent which we appreciate. Of course we had to shop a little in the county store and found some gifts"}
{"text":"My wife and I have always enjoyed The Cracker Barrel - we have dined at the Cracker Barrel in St George UT and Kingman AZ - they were both very nice dinning experiences - but now about our experience in Las Vegas at the Silverton Cracker Barrel - Horrible does not even come close to the truth - my eggs were over cooked - hash brown casserole was undercooked and the potatoes were chewy and slightly raw as they use dehydrated hash brown - saw mill gravy was tasteless and like wallpaper paste - bacon was good - grits were thin and watery - biscuits were undercooked - my wife's eggs were overlooked - same hash brown casserole chewy and undercooked - her bacon was also good - service was kinda ok but she keep forgetting things - all in all would have been a better to take a day trip to St George then have a bad breakfast - the thing that gets me is that it is hard to mess up breakfast - but these guys destroyed breakfast - 
Do yourself a favor and drive by and wave - 
You will thank me later"}
{"text":"Went here on a Monday morning. We didn't have to wait to be seated but it seemed like we beat the rush. In all fairness...I'm not a country food lover. I knew going in this wouldn't be my favorite. There wasn't a whole lot of variety on the breakfast menu. Everything seemed to be some sort of iteration of grits biscuits and a meat. I ended up choosing the blueberry pancakes. Food took longer than it should've. Weirdest pancakes I've ever had...more like griddle cakes. They seemed almost fried and were at times salty and way too buttery. Boyfriend wasn't crazy about his food either...but he did say the hash brown casserole was good."}
{"text":"We've dined here many times, it's hit or miss on food and service. This past weekend was a definite miss! Food order was messed up, we sat the entire time with empty beverages, then I found a black object in the mashed potatoes (size of an almond) cut it in half to see if it was a bug, it wasn't.  Finally got server's attn, she proceeded to tell me it was part of the potato, and asked if I wanted to speak to a manager - not sure how that was going to help - didn't offer to replace the side of potatoes.  Obviously I was not going to eat the mashed potatoes, most people wouldn't after finding a strange black object in them.  We've had really bad experiences here before, but then we'll have a good experience.  Just very inconsistent - but this was NOT good customer service by far."}
{"text":"Très beau décor et bon service.  Le coût des repas est bien.  Ma salade cesar avec poitrine de poulet était correct mais sans plus.  L'assiette de mon conjoint (steak) était bonneet sa portion généreuse.   Par contre leur limonade était excellente."}
{"text":"Home cooking at its finest!! As you start to come in you pass all the beautiful wooden rockers & just have to sit a spell!! Then you walk in and see a great store of anything you can imagine!! When all of a sudden you are hit with the smell of mom or grandmas cooking!! You are seated fairly quickly & the servers are busy!! The coffee was delicious & I consider myself a coffee snob!! lol Breakfast was so yummy! Biscuits & gravy like mom used to make. Hash brown bake was delicious with onions & cheese! Chicken fried steak was so tender & tasty!! The server were so attentive & my coffee cup was never empty!! If you love southern comfort food, you will love it!!"}
{"text":"The closest Cracker Barrel to where we live is about a two hour drive. So we jumped on the opportunity to have breakfast. We went at 11 AM on a Sunday morning. It was very busy, it was loud, and there was a wait. Fortunately, we only waited about 5 minutes for our party of five.

I actually counted the number of people in the half of the dining area we were in while everyone else played the triangle peg game. The count was 122. With it being that busy, our food only took 14 minutes to come out after ordered. Our server did a great job and did not miss a beat.

I had Momma's Pancake breakfast with the sausage patties as my side. I was very pleased with my breakfast. The pancakes are on the lighter side and when they brown, the edges are tasty and crispy. You also get your own personal bottle of warm maple syrup. Everyone was in a pancake mood and all five of us ordered pancakes and all five us were happy with our meals.

We finished up and paid at the register up front. We browsed through the store while the kids got a game of checkers in. Whenever we're on road trips we'll continue to visit Cracker Barrel when we have the chance."}
{"text":"Be sure to ask to be seated in Karen from Atlanta's section. Her service is excellent. The sourdough french toast was so yummy, with that warm syrup of course!"}
{"text":"Short wait, quick service, always had everything we needed at all times. Our waitress was great and made our trip enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Restaurant right of freeway; always easy to get table expect on Sunday's. 
Service; Server was nice, food delivery was a bit slow. 
Food; Always what expected, yum."}
{"text":"I love the food here at this Cracker Barrel but the service is sometimes a little slow especially on the weekends when it's crowded, but since the food is fresh it's OK!  

The menu selection is nice but the one thing I don't like is that they don't have bold coffee! The coffee here is so weak it taste watered down and it's not good!!! 
I love the country store, there's always something original to be found! A little pricey but interesting items therein!

Let's work on this coffee situation so we can improve the star rating!"}
{"text":"We have been here too many times to count...the service is ALWAYS amazing!  And the food...we are typically in for breakfast - SO YUMMY!  And you can not beat the prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Good for breakfast. Went on a weekday which was so great because there was no waiting. Brought the kiddos with me for the 1st time and they really liked their meals - except for the grits. They've never had it before, but I have and it wasn't anything special and it really didn't taste all that good. The portions were good size and we ended up taking some boxes home.  I grew up eating at CB after church on Sundays when there was one in Cerritos, CA long long ago. Still enjoy the quirkiness of the general store in the front as did my kids when they first walked in. Will continue to go here when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I don't see the big deal!! Pancakes were crispy out side and soft inside very good. But Bacon & sausage were dry , cold and taste like they were cooked a couple of hours before. Not fresh. Our sever ( Bridgett ) was not a very good sever. Coffee and our ice tea never refilled. Asked for extra ice. Never Got it. She acted like she didn't want to be there. She never came back to see if we needed anything until she dropped off bill and by then it was too late. Being a business owner myself. Customer service should be #1."}
{"text":"This a great place for home style food.  The
Meatloaf is always a go to because it really tastes just like moms (or grandmas).  The atmosphere is a southern farm kind of feeling.  My favorite part of stopping every time is the gift shop in front of the restaurant!  They have the cutest things in there..old fashioned candy, baby clothes, jewelry, home and garden decorations, etc.  however this place is a little more pricey than basically everything in the surrounding area, but worth it none the less!"}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel! I come here for my birthday breakfast every year. Even though it was busy this year since my birthday fell on a Sunday, our waitress was very attentive and efficient.

Food wise: The pecan pancakes are phenomenal! The hash brown casserole is also very tasty. The bacon is always perfectly cooked. You can't go wrong with breakfast here.

Definitely one of my favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Came to AZ to visit family and they suggested this place for lunch.  I almost got breakfast but was happy I chose the lunch menu.  Hubby got meatloaf and said it was good.  I got the farm raised catfish with fried okra, steak fries and brown rice. It was soooooooo good.  Cant forget about the great service! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was really good but I'd like to mention the awesome waiter I had today. Kevin was really kind and fun! He was on top of things and was very friendly. As a rising star waiter, I think he deserves to move on to the next level! Great service. Great food."}
{"text":"While I actually find this place depressing, I give it 3 stars for 2 reasons. One, my parents LOVE to take me here when I'm hangin' with them in Sun City. Or as I call it, God's Waiting Room. Two, the best cheesy hash browns. Ever. In the world. While they serve all day and all meals, I've only had breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuit. All just fine. But it's the cheesy hash browns y'all. Mom loves the pancakes. And dad. \"Best damn cup of coffee I ever had.\" Ok, pops. Better than Folgers. Really? And there's kitchy like crates and wicker baskets hanging all over the place. Yikes, who dusts that crap? Before you even step foot in the restaurant you are forced to navigate \"the store\". Oh Jesus Mary. The store. Full of like, Holly Hobbie meets John Deere stuff. Creepy weird. 

But oh, the cheesy hash browns."}
{"text":"The service was subpar. Definitely could do much better. The hostess was horrible. She was on her phone durning her shift and was even on it when taking some people to their tables. Not something you should see at a restaurant. She seemed to not care about her job at all. Our waitress was very nice even thought there was a mixup in the orders. She did the best she could and made up. The manager came and helped us which was good."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Great food, friendly service, and a awesome atmosphere. I usually get the chicken and dumplings platter with mac n' cheese, hashbrown casserole, and fried apples. Always delicious!!! Haven't really tried much else here (i'm a creature of habit) but I'm sure it's good. Love the country store as well."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Thursday waited 45 minutes for our lunch. Omelet was cold, special of the day Shepards pie was awful. Plus I was charged $3.00 for 3 paper thin slices of nontasting tomato slices. I won't ever go back there. They weren't even busy."}
{"text":"We are still waiting for a table...we are a party of 13 and were told that they were putting a table together for us just to tell us \"oh sorry...i got busy and didn't set it up and now we dont have room for you and we dont know how long it will be\"....it wasn't busy when we got here...now the place is packed and its been over an hour...i feel that Ana (the brainless hostess) should be fired! And now my 77 yr old mom thinks that the hosts are purposely not seating us and they are just smiling at us laughing between themselves. This is not the first time we have had a problem at this location...we haven't been back here in around 4 years because of an incident involving my sisters purse and a tray full of drinks....we usually travel farther to by the stadium...we thought we would try this one again for the convenience....BAD CHOICE!!
Only good thing about our experience was Kacie & Starr Marie....great servers!!....the dead fly in my cousins food was awesome....no manager has come to our table for that yet....CRACKER BARREL PEOPLE....HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE?!!?"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero I would. First of all we had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated and there were only four of us two little girls and two ladies. My family waited another 15 minutes for our drink orders to arrive INCORRECTLY, then another 56 minutes for a very simple meal which arrived mostly cold.  My sister and I were turned off by the service (OVERWHELMED WAITRESS) cold food, and atmosphere (the people were as cold as the food that arrived) however WE still paid $42.99 for the entire horrible experience, along with a healthy tip for our overwhelmed waitress wearing a United States Marine Corps Red t-shirt. I guess my long braids, our little girls long natural locks did not scream - I TOO AM AMERICA. My family and I will never patronize this restaurant chain again. Thank you and your services are no longer needed.
CRACKER BARREL, was a horrible experience.  Perhaps your old time country store should strongly consider REBRANDING itself to be diverse, inclusive and GENUINELY warm with hospitality for all.

BLUF,
The food when it finally came was as cold, tasteless, and unfriendly as the atmosphere and service. 

UNSAT!"}
{"text":"Wow. I can't get over how bad our service was today.  Megan took our order (sans smile) and we never saw her again. Other people delivered our food -after 25 minutes. While the food was fine the portions were tiny and we never got refills or anything else we needed. Painfully bad. Bathrooms were also dirty which is a serious offense for a CB. I complained to the manager on duty but didn't walk away with much confidence that they will work to correct. This location has some work to do."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel!

I love the country boy combo!

I love their coffee!

The wait time is ridiculous :( avoid this place on Sunday, it was only me and some people came after me and got seated before me,,, there should be no reason for A wait that long.

No napkins :( once they drop your check they forget about you like a Chinese buffet :)

Service is only good by older waitresses unfortunately :(

If you get lucky the waitress is very attentive or completely ignores you.


The eyelash in my egg was not cool :$

I think the amount of customers on Sundays makes the service and the food making quality below their normal standards, quantity of potato casserole was less than normal, eggs were connected together they are usually separate, order was missing an item, it's being in a rush that makes the experience rushed and sloppy.

Definitely won't come back here on a Sunday."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the store is cute. I would give them a 5 star but they really need to rethink their system for waiting on a table and paying for your meal. It's a complete zoo in their store/lobby area, which makes me sometimes want to leave and go somewhere else. They really should just take payment at the table like a normal restaurant. There's already a massive line to wait to be seated, no need to have more lobby congestion for those paying too."}
{"text":"This is new for Las Vegas and this was the first time I ate at a Cracker Barrel. My friends raved about it but honestly I don't know why.


There was a long wait, you go pass all these clothes to a small eating area. Country store or restaurant? Pick a struggle. 

My food was mediocre: fish, mashed potatoes, green beans, and fried okra. The best thing on the plate was the green beans. Service was decent although our server was training a newbie and the poor thing spilled water on the two people sitting on the end of the table. Very loud unable to have a conversation or hear the people at your own table. 

Paid at the register and saw Bit 'O Honey candy hence the three stars.

This was my first and last time eating at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"This is the second Cracker Barrel I've been to, and it's pretty good. I love how cheap it is and how much food you get.

They do not have many choices in the healthy department, just things like fruit subs and egg whites, but what they lack there they sure do make up for in their flavors.

I got a pancake combo with hashbrown casserole and over easy eggs. The pancakes were huge, and kinda had a burnt taste to them, but the casserole was sooo good! It's cheese and potatoes and onions and all sorts of yummy stuff, save for meat, rolled onto your plate in a gooey ball.

My boyfriend got a pancake combo too with turkey and eggs as well and devoured the whole thing.

We came at a very busy time (my guess in after Sunday morning mass) but were seated very fast and out of there within an hour."}
{"text":"Why hasn't anyone told me about this place before??? Amazing breakfast! Got eggs, sausage, a yogurt parfait, and an apple bran muffin. Everything was as good as I hoped! My girlfriend had a potato hash casserole, that was so savory and delicious. Think of au gratin potatoes but in hash form. Great service, and cheap. Lovely kitschy crap on the walls. I'm so happy for having come here."}
{"text":"I loved how I walked in, it was like a mall. They had everything.  Clothes to shoes, and to candies and other junk. I love it all. 

I got the Mamas breakfast I believe. I shared with my boyfriends daughter. She loved the sausage and bacon, then again, she's five. She loves everything.  Lolz. the pancakes was so good. They even had their own syrup little bottle, super cute. 

Boyfriend got the french toast. Ehhh. Not my thang. Too bland for me. Im picky about my french toast. So that was a negative. 

I didn't like how we had to pay up front, it was kind of confusing. . People can easily walk out. Smh. Didn't like that whole concept. 

Yes, I'll come backk :)"}
{"text":"When I saw there was a Cracker Barrel in the area I knew I had to go! My good friend Al, would tell me about this being one of his regular stops on their way to New Mexico to visit family. I was surprised upon entrance to find a retail store in full operation! Besides packaged and ready to eat foods, there were knick knacks, Halloween decor,  Christmas trees even toys and clothes for sale! Now for the food! Grits were creamy,  biscuits were soft and fluffy, and my medium over easy eggs were perfect. The hashbrown casserole was interesting! I want to recreate it at home! It was a kitchy home lodgey type of place.  Our waitress was super sweet too! They serve lunch and dinner too but breakfast is what they are known for and is served all day!"}
{"text":"I had never eaten here had only heard about it from family and friends. Oh my ...... the best !!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't even want to give this place a star. This place has the worst breaksfast ever. No one has clue of what good food is, and obviously you people do not have taste buds. I tried this place because of these reviews."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant has only 3.5 stars.  We been here plenty of times and the food and service has always been more than great!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at Cracker Barrels a long time. The experience keeps slipping. I don't think we'll be back after our last visit. 

Firstly, and most concerning, is they allow open carry in their restaurants. Last weekend we went for breakfast and of course there was a wait, so we sat with our 5 month old in the rocking chairs. Some yahoo with a revolver slung low on his hip sits down across from us and because the muzzle of the gun was so long, when he sat down across from us the barrel became parallel to his thigh, I looked up and was staring directly into the barrel of his gun. It was pointed at my head and my baby's head. He looked a little on the slow side, how do I know if the safety's on or not? I got up and moved. I don't know why Cracker Barrel would want to take on that kind of liability with having loaded guns carried around a family restaurant.

Secondly, they've filled up the front \"store\" section with so much crap you can barely get through. There's always a ton of old people there, with walkers and/or oxygen and it's a hassle. It's hard to wade through with a purse, and it's a double hassle with a baby carrier. You have to gingerly step around stuff, trying not to knock over any of the bric-a-brac. I don't know what kind of revenue per square foot they're getting in that part of the restaurant to continue adding rack after rack but I can't stand it anymore. 

The clutter in the front is annoying and their gun policy is unsafe. Plenty of other breakfast places to go to in the area. Won't be going back anymore."}
{"text":"Last time here several months ago was so bad we had to contact upper management. The only reason we returned was to use the gold card they sent. Went on a recent Saturday night and it was fairly empty. We were seated immediately. We sat for nearly 15 minutes, no joke, before anyone even came to take drink orders, and the server said our actual server was \"tied up at the moment.\"

Took a good while for our food to come out, and we noticed that at least 2-3 tables in our area, in which customers had finished their meals and left, had not been cleaned. Our food was just ok, I used to love Cracker Barrel but I can totally see a decline in the quality and food options. Anyway, the old lady manager at this location is horrible. She walks around and all she does is say \"I'm sorry\" at multiple tables when something is wrong with an order. With the decline in service and food quality I doubt I'll return to any Cracker Barrel again."}
{"text":"As you drive through the little town that is Robinson, you happen to come across a promising restaurant that is Cracker Barrel. With the old timber styled building, you can smell the aroma of a nice wood burning as you take your first breath out of your car. Continuing to walk towards the building, you make the commitment to not only your stomach but your soul. You step within the establishment to an amazement that is the Old Country Store, which is covered from wall to wall in purchasable material that ranges from clothing to candy. As you approach the hostess station you are greeted with a friendly smile and a \"Welcome to Cracker Barrel, how many today?\" Step by step you are lead to your table where a caring server meets you to take your order. As you wait for your food you have the option to play checkers or the infamous Peg Game that is placed on each table. (Now for the good part). The food comes out steaming on a classic white platter. The taste of a hearty, home cooked meal that only your grandmother could have cooked is in every bite you take. As you take your final bites, you are left with the question: \"Will I come back to this restaurant?\" The answer is, Yes. You will come back. As I have come back, and as my forefathers have come back time and time again."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are so down on the Cracker Barrel (Other than for the homophobia and racism. \"Allegedly.\").

This place has got it all! Pancakes! Toys! Fried things! Rocking chairs! Gravy! Knick-knacks! Biscuits! Mason jars! Aprons! It's like the world's fattest nightclub, as described by Stefon on SNL.

Had a work lunch here today, which brought me back for the first time in maybe 5 years or so. I wouldn't mind coming back soon - I thought the food was delicious, inexpensive, and adequate healthful choices: I opted for the grilled rainbow trout and plain steamed veggies...but then ate an entire order of Coca Cola cake, which was OMG ridiculous. I want that every day forever from now on.

The lady who rang us out at the register was adorable, and so sweet!"}
{"text":"The online wait list system is awesome!  We literally walked up, they called our name, and we got seated immediately.  They have this cute little golf tee game at the table that keeps you entertained while you wait for the food.  My only complaint was the space between the tables was cramped, but they tried to accommodate us and our stroller to the best of their ability.  I think the service was impeccable but there was nothing amazing about the food....  Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad at all, just nothing that wowed me.  I was expecting the best comfort food I've ever tasted.  But this place seems like a Claim Jumper's to me....I tried the country fried steak with mac and cheese/hasbrown casserole/dumplings.  My husband got the same thing but with a baked sweet potato/fried apples/grits.  The gravy on the chicken fried steak didn't really impress me an anything unique.  The option of 3 sides with the entrée is nice so you can sample different things.  The portion size is just right for the price.  I would go again for convenience, but I probably won't be a regular."}
{"text":"Got the Roast w/ 3 sides... SO DISAPOINTED!!! The best thing in this pic is thw pancake!  Where is the meat?? This gravy is blah. No onions, peppers or potatoes.  Why would you put anything with a sauce touching other food! Dinner is not their strong point!"}
{"text":"There is no way this place can be healthy! But it was a hearty way to start off a busy work week. I had never been to a Cracker Barrel before. Crazy, right? The little shop was interesting. I didn't find anything that I just HAD to have, but there were some cute little things in there. 

Now on to the restaurant. It seemed too crowded and I was a little unsure where to enter and exit the establishment. But overall the food hit the spot and I thought our server was very sweet. The dining experience was decent, but I think I'd rather opt for a less cluttered place with a healthier, menu full of local and fresh items in the future."}
{"text":"French toast is so yummy!! Everywhere I go I ALWAYS order French toast and hot chocolate for breakfast. Very yummy. Much better than IHOP. Servers are kind, I don't know much about southern hospitality and don't care for it as long as the service is wonderful which everytime I go IT IS. If ur worried about wait times check their website or just type them into google and look at the live busy time chart!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to come here. The food is fresh and consistent every time. Servers are generally upbeat and attentive. Floors and bathroom are always clean. I'm very pleased."}
{"text":"Been enjoying Cracker Barrel for years in different states/locations and even had eaten at this location when first opened. Very disappointed this time as store definitely changed. Mostly clothes in the little store, staff slow response overall. Food portions much smaller at same price, no napkins on the tables anymore as well. Service horrible and not only took almost 30 minutes to get our food, was cold when brought out (really, not kidding - eggs a little warm). When we asked for napkins finally brought to table when we were finished. 

Do not recommend eating at Cracker Barrel anymore and will not eat their myself ever again. Really disappointed and clearly severe management issues. Don't waste your time or money while there are more quality restaurants still to choose from. If I pay a premium price I expect a premium experience. Cracker Barrel used to be like that. Importantly with many years hospitality and F&B experience if this location inspected for food health standards they will fail. Cannot serve cold food, especially eggs."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak looks like they are pre-cooked and they just warm them up

All of these crackerbutts do the same fucking thing"}
{"text":"Well, if you read my first review of this place, you would have thought that I might never return.  I have been back a few times since then, and the smell of piss is gone at least ;-).  The food is 3 star worthy most of the time,  A-OK.  Most people that come visit us are from either LA or San Diego, so on their way out of town, we usually drive down here to get some breakfast.  It's right off the freeway, and it sends people on their way with a full stomach at least (Cracker Barrels portions are ALWAYS pretty large..props for that).  We decided to come here on Sunday for a late breakfast (10:45am).  I browsed the menu, and something caught my eye.  The Sunday Homestyle Chicken Dinner (After 11:00am, only on Sundays!).  I decided to order that with mac and cheese and hash brown casserole as my \"veggies\".  Here is how it was............

Sunday Homestyle Chicken Dinner-  This thing is a beast!  It comes with 2 boneless chicken breasts dipped in their buttermilk batter and fried golden brown.  These are not small breasts either.  If they were in the human female form, they would be at least DD's!  These breasts were huge!  They were fried up perfectly, hot and crunchy and still moist in the middle.  I was extremely impressed and this instantly became the best thing I have ever had at Cracker Barrel!  My wife ordered the same thing and she was just as impressed.  This fried chicken was fantastic!  One of the better fried chicken items I have ever had!  As far as my sides....Mac and cheese.  It was just ok.  Pretty creamy and tasty enough, but it didn't knock my socks off and I would probably get a different side next time.  The other side was their hash brown casserole.  I have always been a big fan of this.  Its like a hash brown pie.  The potatoes are nicely browned, the flavor has hints of cheese and onions, and overall, it is always a winner.  A must have side dish when at Cracker Barrel.  Oh yeah, this dinner also comes with either corn bread of buttermilk biscuits/muffins.  I went with the muffins and they were tasty.  I ate those last because the sheer size of the 2 chicken breasts was filling me up pretty quick.  Even though I was full, the biscuits with a little butter, hit the spot.

Overall, it was an excellent meal!  I think I may only come to Cracker Barrel after 11am on Sundays from here on out.  That whole gigantic meal was less than $10.00!  Can't beat that at all.  That fried chicken meal on its own, is damn near 5 stars.  Cant say enough good things about it!  If you are ever there on a Sunday, definitely order it...you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"It was too crowded and small inside. Customer service could've been better but the food was really good."}
{"text":"This country fresh barn yard style in Vegas is definitely a must stop before you head back home. Is it a coincidence that these two different lifestyle meet here in Nevada? Busy city life to calm country food life. I think not! Because Vegas is home to so many different food cultures and choices. Who doesn't want choices!!! ;) 

Like I said it's a must stop before you leave. It's little humble but fast pace country restaurant really does hit the spot. The food is all about country Stlye and I can't describe how great the food taste. Please take my word that you will not regret eating here before you leave. 

Be adventurous and try new things. Like Andrew Zimmerman says \" if it looks good, than eat it\"!"}
{"text":"OK food for a chain restaurant.  The egg dishes did come with three eggs instead of two which is nice.  The biscuits were less fluffy and more salty than I like.  The prices are a bit steep for what you get too."}
{"text":"The food, much like other Cracker Barrels I've been in, is very good. The reason for the rating was the wait. Over an hour! I should've known better, being that it's by the strip. This is not a place for locals."}
{"text":"The classic Cracker Barrell experience. Friendly service and great food. In fact, our waitress Brianna was maybe the kindest, best server we've ever had (and we've been to a lot of Cracker Barrels across the country). Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh Cracker Barrel how I have missed you since my honeymoon 6 years ago!  I was sooo excited when we decided to take a Phoenix roadtrip because I knew you were in my future!! :)

Love the store, I can always find a good treasure.  And there is a particular candy my husband can only find there so we loaded up on his Zotz.  

Our server was friendly and good.  We ordered breakfast and I was totally bummed with the gravy for my biscuits. It was bland. The hashbrown casserole, however, was absolutely heavenly.  I've already googled the recipe!  My family did enjoy their pancakes and french toast. 

I will always stop at CB when I find one.  Hopefully they never come to California!! :) :)"}
{"text":"Typically a favorite place to eat when I leave California. I always look forward to the down home rich flavors  and hearty portions.   This visit was quite disappointing.   The grits  seemed like they had been sitting for a while.  The bacon was not thick sliced as promised on the menu and was beyond soggy.   This was due to the fact that half the slice was undercooked.   The other half of the slice was cooked just right.   The gravy had a very strange flavor, almost chemical.   The biscuits were dry and chalky.    Another guest sitting at our table said they shouldn't even be called biscuits.   The cornbread was completely flavorless like the biscuits and so dry  you could choke on them. The apples were missing that caramel color that make them appetizing;  instead they were  more of a cream colored white.  Service was just OK. The sever  referred to all the females at the table as \"girl.\"   It's too bad; we were really looking forward to the experience."}
{"text":"Mmmmm... well if you look at my reviews. You will see I'm not big on negative reviews. My personal belief is there is plenty of negativity in our world without me contributing to it. HOWEVER. This specific location has to be one of the worst I have been to in awhile. Let's start with the food. The traditional menu items is why we come right. It's sad when it gets to you table and it's barely warm and bland, flavorless. NOT your typical Cracker Barrel. So what's wrong with this location. Mmmm. Now to the service... I might understand somewhat if it was busy... SOMEWHAT! But 3:30 pm on a Tuesday. NO EXCUSES!!! Inattentive server who can't remember easy things like napkins, a fork, or ketchup. She took an order then dropped food at a table and STILL DID NOT GET THE THINGS THAT WERE ASKED FOR. Only after another request was made from a different server did we get what was needed. Then she comes back after to attempt to put someone at ease. Lol! The food was mediocre at best NOT worth our hard earned money. The service was some of the WORST I have ever experienced in Las Vegas. Poorly run with poor management and terrible staff. Go somewhere else. Do Not Eat Here! Drive to St George if you wanna eat at Cracker Barrel. Should be one star. I won't be back. Thanks for nothing Cracker Barrel.Definitely NOT living up to the Cracker Barrel reputation."}
{"text":"We have been here 4 times since they opened (a week ago ) . No problem with the wait times . We had 1 excellent server within the 4 visits. The other 3 I feel definitely needed more practice . Tonight was definitely disappointing . The server couldn't keep up with anything . He did not know the menu at all . Our drinks sat empty for most of our visit . Heck , the poor guy didn't even know how to carry drinks on the tray. IMO it's their job to train their staff and not the servers fault . Now , the food . Portion sizes have not at all been consistent . Tonight, even the server who dropped our food off to us called my dinner a kids plate and it was served on the same round plate my sons kids meal was . I checked the bill to double check , but it was charged as adult . My husbands meatloaf plate was definitely bare compared to our previous visits . On all of our visits food temp has been an issue .. Most things are not hot just warm at most . Tonight , also was the first time I did not see one manager or trainee helping and they definitely never came to our table Like they had on previous visits . I think I will be taking a break from here until they can get things in proper order. If you have a new server who needs help you should be helping him or training him more before having him serve guests . I would just like to see the same service as I have always gotten at every other Cracker Barrel, which has always been excellent ."}
{"text":"Family was in town for the holidays and we had a little time to kill before we got our Santa picture taken at the Bass Pro Shop. I tried to take everyone to Snooze in Tempe for breakfast but my mom insisted on Cracker Barrel saying it was good even though she'd never been here. 

A long story short, it wasn't good. We didn't have to wait, so that was nice, but the only thing tasty was the hash brown casserole. My older son got a cinnamon French toast dish that he enjoyed but gave him an awful case of stomach cramps and diarrhea the rest of the day. 

Honestly, I tried to warn them. My mom seems to think of a restaurant has customers, it has to be good. McDonald's has customers and I think their food is just awful. I know many disagree, but those are probably the same people eating at Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"So NOT a gourmet place but their cheesy hash-brown casserole is worth a trip itself. It's not the kind of place for brunch where you can expect fancy omelets but everything is pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible... food was boring, service was fine. Wanted to have the oatmeal but I can't have dairy and they batch cook it each morning with milk ( why?? ) when I expressed that it was strange to put milk in oatmeal to cook the server sent over the manager and let me state that was the most rude arrogant manager I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with, he basically said sorry not sorry that's the way it is... then why did you even bother company me over? All downhill from there food came out 20 minutes apart and was barely adequate at best.  Do yourself a favor and skip this place!"}
{"text":"Conpared to other similar breakfast restaurants, CB is extremely overpriced.    I was charged $1.19 to add cheese to scrambled eggs and was not advised of the up charge.  I ordered a cup of fruit and received a very small container (not cup) of fruit continuing 1 strawberry(cut in half), 2 small pieces of pineapple and 4 blueberries...for $2.69.  The service was poor and that's being kind.  Getting a cup or refill in decaf coffee was an Act of Congress.  I was charged $2.69 each for three milks, one of which was chocolate...not what we ordered and returned immediately and unopened.  A complete rip off!  CB U SHOULD BE ASHAMED!  There r lots of other bfast options and, trust me, CB will not be a choice for my family again...$62.29 for bfast?  Ridiculously overpriced with extra charges that were not explained and charges for items not received...and of course the thimble of fruit!"}
{"text":"We were going up to Phoenix and decided to have a late breakfast about 11.00 AM.  After debating where to go perusing mentally  through the usual chain restaurants, Denny's, IHOP etc. we decided to give Cracker Barrel a shot.  The place was very crowded and had to wait 15min.  Not too bad.  We figured it would be slow service once we got seated.  No problem.  A waitress came right over to us and took our order.  They have huge selections of interesting breakfast combos as well as lunch choices even before noon.   I got the 2 scrambled eggs with 3 dry crispy slices of bacon, it came with a wonderful light yogurt parfait with nuts, raisins, fresh fruit.  I had some of my husband's pancakes which I believe it was about 4 huge ones with his order of 2 eggs, bacon and it came with the pancakes.  Very reasonably priced.  Food came in about 10 minutes.  Nice and hot and really very very good. The little country store is adorable and fun to walk through it."}
{"text":"Good food at decent prices. Staff was great and they have plenty of parking. The wait is under 30 minutes and well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Perfect family restaurant... I love their breakfast specially their new strawberry lemon French toast, is the perfect combination of sweet and little tartness from the lemon.. Each bite is full of flavor that just melts in your mouth ... The customer service is superb ..."}
{"text":"Third time here and probably the last. Each time we come it's gotten a little worse and seems to be more be expensive! Just dropped $60 for breakfast for 2 adults and 2 kids including tip. $3 for a kids drink? 

My breakfast was clearly sitting in the hot window for a while before it came out, skin formed over my grits and the bacon/sausage were room temp if I was lucky. The kitchen was having issues today for sure: the lady by us sent her food back stating it was cold and another table around us sent their eggs back due to being overcooked.

Our server Jason was awesome and very friendly. I wish him the best of luck as he clearly wants to get into management with the company. 

It was fun while it lasted Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food! Cracker Barrell has the best hashbrown casserole! Im not a fan of the ham but everything else is amazing! Especially biscuits and gravy!! We were sat right away and food didnt take long to come out. Dont forget to stop in the shop to buy something! We had to buy the cute halloween salt and pepper shakers."}
{"text":"I want to say that I am completely biased in this review.  Every time we go to Cracker Barrel it's at the end of a hard mission trip, so I am as hungry as a lion. Secondly, I'm in love with southern cooking so any restaurant with really good sweet tea is a winner.

And yes, let's get to the food!  The chicken fried chicken is excellent.  It is not horrendously overcooked and the chicken was juicy, hot, and tender.  Most of the entrees come with two sides, so I got me some mash potatoes, whole kernel corn, and a side of grits.   Their grits are fairly good, but I should have asked them to put some melted butter over it.  I also tasted the fish fry (the Friday special), and the portions were very generous - two huge slabs of fried catfish.  I'm about to get that next time!  OR perhaps the rib eye steak, as their seasoning and sauce is something unique to Cracker Barrel.

Overall, the ambience is cozy and homely.  The service was awesome, considering our party was for 40 people.  They kept us happy with topping off our glasses of sweet tea and giving us some plenty of cornbread. You gotta go here on your way through Arizona!"}
{"text":"If you need a quick meal this is the stop to make. It comes out fast.The trout and catfish are good as well as the grilled chicken tenderloins. They serve breakfast all day. The service is usually pleasant."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here. Biscuits and Gravy? Fried Chicken? A little taste of the South? You've got it."}
{"text":"Oh the smell.  Potpourri, candles, perfume.  So many scents to navigate through until you reach the dining room.  If anything they should allow smoking.  It might still make you vomit, but at least it would cover up those artificial smells."}
{"text":"I wanted so much to like it. The food was terrible and that was after a 35min. wait. I ordered a prime rib french dip and there was no au jus, beef not prime was overly salty. My hubby ordered the big meat breakfast that had 2 strips of overdone bacon, two hockey puck sausage, also two eggs that were over hard that were supposed to be over easy. He forgot the biscuits but they turned out to be extremely hard and cold. He brought our drinks in small paper cups because he said all the glasses were dirty."}
{"text":"Staying at a nearby RV park. Hubby wanted pancakes & this was the closest to us. Been to Cracker Barrel before for dinner  so gave it a chance. We got there about 7:10 & still had 3 before us but got in about 5 minutes. 

Hubby ordered his pancakes & I got Mamma's Pancake that came with eggs & bacon that we would share. I asked if I could get Blueberry Pancakes with it-server said No Problem. Well, it was...

We waited for 15 minutes with others getting meals. Guess pancakes take longer. Got his pancakes, the eggs & bacon of my order and then got regular instead of Blueberry pancakes.  She said it was her fault & went back quickly to reorder. Hubby started on his pancakes while they were hot & we ate the eggs & 1 bacon-but they were soft-the fat was still white & the meat part was not done enough either. I asked if they would cook them a little more but no-they had to bring new ones. She was gone before I could say never mind. So more waiting :( 

My Blueberry Pancakes finally came but looked like they were fried. They were so crispy hubby could hear me crunch when I ate the edge. I ate part of one & asked for a box-hoping they would be better tomorrow. The bacon came & it was HARD. So overdone that it had to be on purpose & they cut (I hope) the fat part so it wouldn't be flabby. I put a butter knife next to it in the picture & they were dwarfed! 

I was SO NOT happy. We packed it up & left. There was another line to pay & hubby nicely said breakfast wasn't good to the girl at the register. She said nothing. Then I was even more not happy so asked for the manager. We waited again & could not even get a manager. We told the girl it was taking too long but explained what happened & she was nice & said she'd pass it on to the manager. 

We have had ok food in other Cracker Barrels so it must be how this one is run. Go anywhere else."}
{"text":"They now have a check in on line process. Since we live 30mins away, it saved us more than half our wait time. 
Checked in on line with a 50wait. 
When we arrived we found the host and she checked us in on her pad and said it was only 10more mins.
BEST idea EVER!!!
Seated quickly, a little tight for a family of five but regardless had great service.
Everyone was so friendly and always asking if we needed anything.
Food didn't take long considering there were 5 of us. 
GREAT fresh coffee and hot food! 
Thanks to our server Daniela S, we'll be back. 
Great team :-) 

Oh they also had a POW table set for vet day thank u"}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas, it's not a lot that can get me off of the Strip but when I found out that there was a Cracker Barrel in Vegas, I swapped my heels for flats and bathing suit for a real shirt...who am I kidding? No I didn't! I wore the swimsuit and headed right to Cracker Barrel and it was well worth it!! The pancakes were AMAZING, the syrup was DIVINE and the hash brown casserole is a MUST eat!! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"It is divine intervention that there is not a Cracker Barrel in LA because I would eat here every weekend if I could!  I finally had a chance to eat at the infamous Cracker Barrel during my visit to Arizona and Yay, I'm a fan!  I had the Momma's Pancake Breakfast and a side of the Hashbrown Casserole and WOW!!  The breakfast reminded me so much of my Great Aunt's old kitchen...nothing beats comfort food (you're welcome to use that Cracker Barrel for a small fee :-))

Although the Breakfast was amazing, it was also recommended to us to try the Meatloaf and Mashed Potatoes on our next trip so I can't wait!"}
{"text":"We love Cracker Barrels. But this disappointed.    No crowd whatsoever so wasn't busy. Service was nice and quick. But the food!!  I ordered \"momma's French toast breakfast\".   I got pancakes.  The bacon for both of our orders was not really edible.  Nasty, too crisp almost burnt. I would have been embarrassed to put that on someone's plate!   I asked for fruit topping for my FRENCH TOAST.  Every other CB I have been to brings the fruit syrup on a bowl on the side.  They brought me pancakes with all of the fruit drenched on top.  I hate soggy pancakes.   I ordered eggs over medium.  Good thing because they were still snotty (whites runny).    I won't visit this location again of the cooks can't cook."}
{"text":"Great service. Everyone was so kind and always checking to make sure that our whole family; two adults and three toddlers/babies were all taken care of. Great experience!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Nothing fancy. Service is only slightly better than going to fast food. Seems like it takes a long time for food to come. I was with a small group of 6 and we waited an hour for our food. I do like the decor and small store"}
{"text":"NO!!! Unless you have nothing better to do than to sit there all-day waiting for your food. I've been there 4 or 5 times in the last two months, because my dad likes to have breakfast there. So I have given them several chances. Always the same result...THEY ARE SUPER SLOW! After we ordered, we waited almost an hour for our breakfast! The wait staff is nice, the food is pretty good (not great), but you have to wait for it! They don't even seem to care that they make you wait so long. If I had to describe what it's like when I'm there...I feel like I'm being punished."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and restaurant is a nationwide chain. Noted for their famous rocking chairs for sale out on the porch, you enter into a whirlwind of various clothes, toys, and all types of products for sale.

The place is always crowded but they do offer friendly service. My girlfriend  and I stopped here to celebrate  New Year's breakfast together which is the best meal of the day they are known for. In fact you can order breakfast all day if you want  and if the portion is too much for you then you can order off the kid's menu.

She ordered pancakes with bacon along with hot tea. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese grits, fruit, tomatoes, and sausage. My tea came in a silver small pitcher which immediately leaked when I tried to pour it into my cup. My friend tried to help me with it but she too experienced problems. We told our waitress and she brought out another one. I noticed that they have several defective pitchers like this because when she ordered a refill she received it in the same pitcher i had before the accident.

We got our food. Her pancakes were burnt and my meal was just fair. I found my sausage a little tough but ate it anyway. She did complain to have the check adjusted. The waitress never offered to bring her a replacement but  made the adjustment anyway. 

I had to order takeout for my daughter-yes, take out is available from any menu all day so that was properly prepared and we were given their cornbread and biscuits to take with it. 

Each table has their famous \"peg\" game you can play while you wait and in the middle of the restaurant is a nice fireplace with a warm fire going. They even have a small section where two people can play checkers.

When we went to pay the cashier, she asked if our meal was alright. I explained what happened with the pancakes so she called the manager. He was kind enough to take that off the check. 

My true rating would have been two and half stars since I feel that they have gone downhill from the days I used to visit. Normally I would eat at one of these restaurants when I'm driving on a trip because they  are located not far from a major exit where you can get on and get off the highway with little difficultly. It may be a while before we return to this location again.

One thing I do like about them is when I'm traveling I get to see the merchandise related to the state or city I'm driving through.  Outside of that, they generally are the same no matter where you go."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Cracker Barrel and after eating and visiting this one is Vegas, maybe Cracker Barrel should stay in the south. Service was horrible, food was horrible.  The online reservation didn't capture our reservation. We received a confirmation text message but still had to go to the waiting line despite having a confirmation. The server made my wife return two pieces of sausage in order to get the bacon she ordered. No fluffy scrambled eggs here. They are flat and folder over. I had one coffee refill during breakfast. The grits had a hard layer on the top. It had to broken up and stirred before eating. This is NOT the CB I've eaten at all over the south and central US. They got one star because the shopping area was great."}
{"text":"Admittedly I'm a southern kid at heart, but I love me some CB! Swung by for late Sunday lunch, and enjoyed the combo Meatloaf, ham, and Chicken n' Dumplings. Ham was decent, but the other 2 were fabulous. 

The wife ordered the daily fried chicken special, which was probably the best food we had. Also of honorable mention were the side of sweet carrots, and the biscuits with Apple Butter. 

My only negative was the long wait time to get a table, but part of that is due to being a new restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"Everything was great, except for the way they fixed my problem.  My dining partner ordered steak and eggs (probably the most expensive breakfast item), the medium rare steak came out extremely well done.  The manager's solution was a different steak in a to go box. I was hoping you would comp the screw up, since he only got to eat eggs and sides for breakfast.I bet he enjoyed the opportunity to eat a 14$ cold steak on his way to work. I also felt like a chump, because I paid full price for half a meal in the restaurant and half on the go."}
{"text":"Sat for over 1/2 hour before food came and then it was wrong. Eggs. If you can't make eggs this is not the restaurant for you."}
{"text":"This place has great food, but the wait is ridiculous. It takes forever to sit down and enjoy your meal!!! I recommend signing in online before you actually leave to relieve some wait time."}
{"text":"I usually don't write a lot to describe restaurants but this site really took the crown! Food coma! The Sunday friend chicken is the best I've ever had, so that tells you a lot about it. Crispy, juicy chicken that is not oily. Delicious with the Louisiana hot sauce. Service was awesome and will definitely add this restaurant to our Vegas list. Forgot to mention the sweet tea compliments the meal."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I got the Mama French Toast special. It comes with eggs and bacon and French toast. The eggs were really small compare to Lumber Jack a few blocks away. The bacons was perfect tho really good. As for the French toast was amazing as well the syrup was not too sweet which I like. However, It took over 30 minutes for our food to come out. I couldn't help but notice that the table of 5 next to me got served first even tho I sat down first and ordered first. The waitress kept apologizing for our wait time. I don't really care, but it was just kind of a bummer. After we ate I went outside there were protestors against Cracker Barrel. I looked up some stuff online and couldn't believe how they completely mistreated their waitress with low paying rate and taking advantage of their employee by giving them insane work load that are timed. 

PLEASE DO NOT EAT AT CRACKER BARREL. AS THEY ARE MISTREATING THEIR EMPLOYEE. I CAN SEE WHY MY WAITER KEPT APOLOGIZING TO ME, BUT FOOD TAKING A LONG TIME TO COOK IS NOT THEIR FAULT YET THEY BLAME THE WAITER FOR EVERY COMPLAINT IN THE RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Since the opening of this location I had been looking forward to dining here. I am awfully disappointed. We were seated immediately. We ordered the steak and the chicken friend chicken. My husbands steak was so salty he had to spit it into his napkin. His biscuit was raw dough. The pancake was burnt and his eggs were cold. My meal came out with no vegetables like i ordered, but eventually came. The chicken was so thin and dry. The vegetables were bland and over steamed. It was worse than hospital food. The food was absolutely DISGUSTING! I am so disappointed. I have heard many great things about Cracker Barrel, but after reading  these reviews it seems like everyone's having the same experience with the quality of food. The customer service is exceptional, but obviously not worth coming if you can't enjoy the taste of your meal. They did comp my husbands steak. We just paid the rest of the tab and got on. It was a first and last for me. Hopefully they can get their food up to par with some of their other locations."}
{"text":"I always look forward to their pancakes and warm syrup food and service is always good when ever I find a Cracker Barrel I try to eat there."}
{"text":"This is my mom's and I all time favorite spot to eat. They are all very friendly and they make sure you are being assisted. There shop is really nice. We love to look at there cute items the sale there."}
{"text":"Yesterday my mom and I went for a drive and ended up going there to look at there Christmas stuff.  Then we decided to eat there big mistake. As the lady at the front who was very friendly sat us we were totally ignored we were sitting for 10 min being totally ignored but the waiter and waitresses 3 of them walking by giving my mom and I dirty looks rolling their eyes refusing to help. So I got up to walk out with my mom who is disabled. I told the lady at the front she got the manager a nice guy but he made lame excuses for his employees. Saying they had a busy lunch time they were supposed to be off hey there is NO excuse on their behavior period. He begged us to give it another shot so we thought ok we were hungry big mistake again. Well the waitress was amazing the other 2 that were the bad ones were still there and was still the dirty looks and rolling eyes. We were giving a free dessert that we didn't ask for but thought ok. Still the point is this is a great country restaurant and shop not high school. We decided after we left to never go back there again. The manager needs to step up as a manager and take responsibility for their action and not be afraid of them and make excuses. The bad waiter and waitresses seemed to have issues and need to be disaplined for there actions."}
{"text":"Delicious food; excellent service! The wait is still a little long which gives time for browsing in their great store! Welcome to Las Vegas, finally."}
{"text":"We LOVE Cracker Barrel and we were so excited to have something that felt like home cooking in Vegas. My  parents want to go EVERYtime they come to visit and we go with them. As other reviewers have stated I keep hoping they will \"get their kinks out\"... RUDE waitresses sub par food. 

Last week my Dad came to town and we came again. I ordered a med. steak and it came VERY well done. the waitresses had been short with us so we decided to wave down the manger. He came over i told him what was wroung and he responded \"so you want another steak?\" Um yes...about 20 mins later the 2nd well done steak came out. When he came back over I had not touched it and he said \"looks like a perfect Cracker Barrel Medium\" Um Medium is a temperature not a style of cooking. He then walked awak. 

Now being tip time the waitress came over and was super nice and said she would take it off the check. I have NEVER had a manager argue with me like this. It was embarrassing and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Las Vegas, NV

Why would anyone give a bad review on this place ? Impossible.  It's a good thing this restaurant is nowhere near where I live. That could be dangerous. I have bin to many locations, in many different states. They have changed some things.

 I had sandwiches. I ordered the  biscuits  with fried chicken inside. Oh soo good. Also ordered hash browns.  It was morning. Wow. I was told they make their own Colbey cheese. Which they put in the Mac n Cheese. My daughter almost cried, so good. And she is a 3rd year, straight A college student.  She knows about a good thing. Also Crack Colbey Cheese they say is in their Hash browns. Wow to amazing. My whole party loved this place. I loved this place."}
{"text":"Pretty nice place to eat 99% of wait staff is great. The 1% dragged it down to 4 stars."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great lunch here as we passed through town. I had the chicken campfire meal and my husband had the chicken BLT both were super tasty and served up quick and hot. We will stop here again anytime we pass through."}
{"text":"Classic breakfast joint by the Silverton Casino and Bass Pro Shops location. Cracker Barrel as a kid was one of my favorite destinations because it had good food and a store that sold everything under the sun. Good to know it's still the same way, as it has been decades since I had been to one.

We go to the Bass Pro Shops often whenever in town and we saw that Cracker Barrel set up shop there was well. We finally got to go on a recent trip and the experience went well. First of all, if you're there during peak breakfast/brunch hours, be prepared to wait a little while to be seated. They have 2 rows of rocking chairs you can plop down on and wait while waiting for your table to be ready. Rocking chairs are always fun. I've never had one in any place I have lived in so its cool to me... And they have a ton of them.

I went with Grandpa's Country Fried Breakfast ($10.29) with country fried steak, scrambled eggs, fried apples, grits & all the fixins (biscuits & gravy, butter and jam). The meal was decent but the country fried steak was overdone. I still ate it cause I was starving having flown into town on the 1st flight but it could have been much better. Eggs were ok, biscuits & gravy were good. The grits were just ok too. My friends would later tell me I gotta get the meatloaf so if i do go back, I will try that. 

Alos ordered was the Sunrise Sampler (eggs, grits, hashbrown casserole,  smoked sausage, ham, bacon & all the fixins) $9.69. It was decent too. Nothing spectacular. Just your typical breakfast meats and eggs. 

Plenty of parking in a shared lot. Be prepared to wait. I think there's a way to get on the waiting list through their website. Sorry to say/see but their men's restroom was not good. They need to clean that up regularly ASAP."}
{"text":"It's the Cracker Barrel, so you know what to expect. A place for big American style breakfast and a chance to shop for eclectic stuff. Always a fun atmosphere. Conveniently located off the freeway and near the airport. If you're hankering for that country atmosphere, no better place than this Cracker Barrel to savor it. Food is as expected, and service is always great!"}
{"text":"We have always had wonderful servers and customer service from the store.  Jake is our favorite person and I highly suggest asking for him if you stop in.

The store, bathrooms and dining area has always been clean and neat.  My oldest son once broke those glass lamps they set on the table, and although I offered to pay for it, they said, \"No problem.  They break all the time.  Don't worry about it!\"  All with a smile.  

The food is always wonderful.  My favorite is the fried fish dinner.  My sons love the kids menu - which you know if you have kids, is VERY IMPORTANT.   I've never had a problem with my food order.

My only downside thought would be for them to stop setting my children next to the fire lamps."}
{"text":"The food was good but service was a dive. After waiting 30 minutes to get in we had to wait another 15 minutes before we got anyone to our table to take our order. Food is a 4 and service is a zero."}
{"text":"Service was wonderful however when my fiancé got his entree country fried steak it came out with a hair we told our server and he apologized and said they would make him another one however not once did a manager come out to talk to us or apologize and we didn't even get any kind of discount for their mistake and still had to wait we weren't picky at all but it would've been nice ."}
{"text":"Good down home cookin'. This is one of hubby's favorite breakfast places. We've never had a bad meal here. The store reels me in everytime...one of a kind children's wear for our young grandkids. If you like it, get it because you'll never find it again! We always recommend if you like southern cooking. On Sundays after church, you'll wait awhile for a table. Not so much on Sunday night."}
{"text":"By far not the best Cracker Barrel I have ever been to.  A couple of reasons that I found for this. 

1. This is the busiest Cracker Barrel in the system and the servers are pretty much overwhelmed most of the time.  They should make it larger and space the tables a bit farther apart.  

2. This is trying to be a charming country eatery but none of the employees have any idea what southern charm is.  They have a clipped west coast flair that would be considered rude in the south.  The experience at a Cracker Barrel in Nashville is a completely different experience. 

The food is typical Cracker Barrel.  Country comfort food with a mass prepared food flavor.   The gravy for the biscuits is good while it is hot but turns to paste when it cools.   The grits are a bit bland but turn to gelatinous goo when they cool.  Very off putting.  

In general, it is southern comfort food cooked for the masses.   Either you like Cracker Barrel or you hate it, there is rarely a middle ground.  I am a fan of breakfast here back in TN, MS, and AR.  As for the Vegas location, I would leave it before I take it. 

If I want southern comfort food, there are better choices in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"We recently visited 2 days in a row since we had a visiting family member here who happens to love Cracker Barrel. The food was consistent both days. I had the French toast one day and the hashbrown casserole and bacon the next. I did have a bite of my husband's pancake which was super good too. In my opinion the French toast and pancakes are the way to go when visiting. 
Our service was inconsistent with the first visit being great and the second being just ok. Overall it was fine. The food and the price are ok and I will visit again."}
{"text":"The food was just ok, basic chain fare. That being said, our server, Michael was excellent. We were seated immediately and the food came out quickly. Some of the other reviews had me worried about the cleanliness of the place but we found it to be quite clean, one of the cleanest Cracker Barrels we have been to."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with my lady friend.  Chicken and rice was awesome today!  Coffee always good.  The atmosphere is always so friendly and the staff is great.  Then Hank walked in.  As you may know, many of the customers at The Cracker Barrel are elderly.  Hank was clearly intoxicated, although it was just after noon.  He was hitting on some of the elderly women using lines from Caddyshack, \"boy! You must have been something before electricity. \" and \"wanna earn 14 dollars? The hard way?\"  I recommend Cracker Barrel.  I do not recommend Hank."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel was always a place I remember stopping at on road trips. But, ever since moving to the South and having them close by, I definitely have made my share of visits.
Ever since this location opened I have made a few stops, but one thing I will say...like every other Cracker Barrel, expect a wait.

The best thing about Cracker Barrel is the menu. An extensive menu that can satisfy two people eating or a large group.
I typically go for breakfast and dinner. The complimentary biscuits and corn bread are always a great way to start the meal. From eggs to chicken and a large variety of sides, the food is always pretty good.

The staff at this location is always on point and I have always enjoyed my meal! And, I love browsing the gift shop while I wait."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. Always loved going to Cracker Barrel when on vacation. We would look forward to a big plate of delicious food. Not this trip. It was very busy and for some reason our waitress was working our section and another section on the other side of the restaurant. Made for very bad service and extended delays in getting things. Our waitress was nice enough but she was overwhelmed. 
So the food.  4 people with 4 different orders and not a single meal was any good. Country Fried Steak was impossible to chew. The breakfast special was half the size of the picture. The grits were watery. And so on and so on. Could not catch a server or manager to complain so we finally left. 
Don't know if it is poor management or the whole chain is trying to get cheap. Not sur I would ever go back."}
{"text":"Out of all the Cracker Barrels we have been to, this overall is the best!

Staff was efficient and friendly.  Drinks were filled regularly without being asked. Place looked clean :)
Wish the fireplace was lit!

Food was consistent and hot. All orders were correct for a party of 6. Wish we lived closer to this location to come back more often."}
{"text":"Once again I must admit this has to be one of the best Cracker Barrels around. 

Our waiter was awesome and not bad looking either ;)

Food was hot and quick! As you may already know it's GOOD too!"}
{"text":"Not much to say here, because aside from all the fake-country-flare, there's really not much going on.

I'm reminded of one of the characters played by Meg Ryan in 1990's Joe vs. the Volcano -- the 'flib-a-da-jib-et' lady who kept saying, \"I have no response to that\".

Pile up all the country kitsch you want, whether in the lobby or on the plate, and I just have no response to that."}
{"text":"First time CB visit, hopefully not the last!

Have been hearing about this place for a long time but, being in CA, never had the chance to check one out.  By all the sounds of it, the food is good, solid home cooking...not meant to be healthy by any means but instead is for comfort and cuddles.  On our visit, we were NOT disappointed.

We were on our way back to CA from AZ and wanted some breakfast.  This place popped up on our Yelp radar so we took a detour and stopped in.  It was doing brisk business but thankfully there was no wait to be seated.

It did, however, take a bit to get waited on.  It appeared our server was responsible for our entire section and maybe part of another.  She kept apologizing but was able to come around more often when some of the other tables cleared out.

The food...was solid, good and really hit the spot. Certainly, I don't think any doctor recommends having chicken fried steak or biscuits and gravy every morning...but it sure is a great occasional treat.

Hubby ended up getting a the Country Boy breakfast and he went with the sirloin steak and hashbrown casserole.  I got Uncle Herschel's with a ham steak and hashbrown casserole.  

And quite honestly, the hashbrown casserole was one of the most amazing things I've tasted in a long time.  That such humble ingredients could be transformed into some deliciousness reminded me that you don't need truffles or foie gras to dine well.  My ham was really tasty as well, being not too salty with just the right amount of fat.  Hubby's steak, while not the most tender, was well seasoned and cooked to a perfect medium.

From what I could see, most of the breakfasts come with \"the fixin's\" which was a pile of tender biscuits, gravy and butter/jam.  The gravy was nice and smoky, kind of different from other versions I've had.

Definitely not a bad choice for breakfast.  I heard there's one opening up somewhere in CA - we may need to seek it out."}
{"text":"Had to wait awhile to get seated, but the hostesses are very friendly. Our waitress was great! We had the breakfast sampler, so big we split it. The food is excellent with a homemade taste. We loved the fried apples. Eggs were perfect, never had cheese in hash browns before but pretty tasty. Wish they had Cracker Barrel in California. Definitely a worthwhile experience. Our meal was $10, and worth more!! Will definitely go bac"}
{"text":"Went back for another visit. Food was good, but, portions seemed pre-measured, out of a bag. Little variation in servings. Had rice and chicken special again. It seemed short on the mushroom sauce. Rice needed more of the sauce. Was disappointed when I ordered a side salad with ranch dressing. The ranch tastes like it comes from a bottle, not fresh. Meal was good, but, not outstanding. Service great."}
{"text":"Decemberists practice space? Paula Deen brainwashing center? The stop along the Oregon Trail where you got dysentary? All of the above. The southern writer William Faulkner said it best in his short story Shingles for the Lord.
 \"The chicken fried steak was juicy like a pair of firm antebellum knockers. Breaded in a crust with more seasoning than Old Hickory himself. The gravy was smooth as a snake oil salesman's pomade drenched hair. I'll take a refill of that sweet tea, thank you kindly. Biscuits fluffier than Taylor Swift's songwriting. The south shall rise again, as I will most certainly have leftovers from this heaping helping of hospi-taste-ity! The war of snobby culinary aggression shall not be won by sabre nor by gunpowder, but by down home inbred deliciousizing. Sushi? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.\"

Cheap, comforting, filling despite any discernible nuance of taste...like a home school education. They also sell kazoos. A snake handling good time!"}
{"text":"I think the food was pretty average.  They have this weird old lady store before you enter the restaurant. Last we came here we didn't even get seated after waiting for about a half hour.  I think if you grew up with this place then it's great, but if you're not familiar with it you probably won't be that impressed."}
{"text":"I really like the Cracker Barrel for breakfast, mainly because it holds a lot of people so there's never a really long wait and it's cheap. Like dirt cheap. You cannot go out to breakfast for less except maybe at the waffle house. This place is far superior to the waffle house. I haven't been here for any other meal, but the breakfast is good. It is a chain, but when you don' want to spend a lot, it's a good option. Also, they have eggs in a basket... I loved that as a kid! props to that."}
{"text":"A great place to find hair in your food and servers who care more about the $$$$ than the service. Have visited the establishment on multiple occasions and have yet to have a successful meal. Our most recent visit resulted in French toast with the toppings of little black hairs and rubbery sausage accompanied by a waitress who cared more to charge us for the meal and get new food rather than to apologize and remove that from the bill."}
{"text":"I didn't grow up with Cracker Barrel, and I was never that familiar with it. I have now dined at a Cracker Barrel restaurant a total of 3 times: Pennsylvania, Utah and now Arizona. Though I know, as a company, they have some different views on things than I do I have always thought their food was simply good ol' homestyle cooking and I have enjoyed it. And this 3rd time was no exception. We went for Thanksgiving, as we had our family's 'traditional' Turkey Day the weekend prior for scheduling purposes. 

First off, I want to say \"Thank You\" to those who worked on Thanksgiving Day. Whether they had the option to work or not, we appreciate you and your GREAT service. 

The place was busy and we went at 11am. We had to wait a bit longer than they initially told us but we were not about to complain - we expected to wait even longer than that! It was so annoying to see people complain about lines and waits, that's why you stay home on one of the busiest days of the year then!

I had to argue with the cashier when she thanked ME for MY patience!

With that said, that's the only tough part of the restaurant's set up. You go to the cashier in the shop to pay for your dining bill, so when it's really busy, things get crowded and a bit pushy. (We wondered how many jerks have just walked out without paying!) Also, all of the people who ordered to-go meals were also trying to get in there ahead of people. The parking lot is also not set up to handle such crowds, especially for their Thanksgiving to-go meal deal - we were waiting to see some yelling matches!

But the food, spot on and tasty! I opted for Meatloaf on Turkey Day (I'm such a rebel). Meatloaf, mash, corn and mac'n'cheese - yes please! So good when you mix it together and then put it on a roll. I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of their corn bread, I like it a little more moist and sweet, but to each their own. I don't think I could eat here every day (like my boyfriend's Dad does...seriously), but I am thinking we definitely need to come back more often!

I wish I remembered our server's name, she's a gem!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place to go to! Highly recommend! Our server Carolina was so sweet and so attentive to our needs make sure to ask for her"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Cracker Barrel?? I love this place! I must admit, I liked it better when we had to drive to Utah to eat there, but having one in town is not too shabby either. I waited a while for the crowds to die down before coming to eat here. My Mom had never been before so we decided to take her on Saturday. What I could not believe was that we walked in with no line and were promptly sat at a table. Bingo! 

The menu is big and there is a lot to choose from. The featured food is southern cooking. I chose the special of the day which was chicken and rice served with a delicious chicken gravy and green beans, my hubby chose chicken and dumplings, and Mom chose the chicken cutlets with fried ochra and fried apples. They bring over some tasty biscuits and cornbread muffins to chew on while you wait for your food. They have a really yummy homemade lemonade which one cannot get enough of. It has a nice tart finish and I consumed multiple glasses of it. Everyone enjoyed their meal and of course saved room for some peach cobbler and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was really rich and decadent but the cobbler was perfect! 

We had really excellent service from Bridgett who provided for all of our needs. All the staff seem to be happy working there and were very kind especially the staff working in the attached gift shop. Oh yeah, this little general store is fun to walk through where it features hard to find classic candy and soda pop! Out on the patio, there are some lovely rocking chairs for purchase and they come in all kinds of colors. The porch was decorated for the Memorial Day weekend so all kinds of red, white and blue was everywhere. Good times!"}
{"text":"So this morning I go to the Cracker Barrel that has just opened on Craig Road and the 15 North Freeway. I ordered the country breakfast. Which came with a side of grits, apple jelly, a biscuit, two pork-chops, hashbrowns and a side of eggs over medium.

I'll  just start by saying that the term Cracker Barrel a country store. Lead me to believe that this was a place that cook's breakfast somewhat like people in the country.

Let me be the first to tell you, that this could not be further from the truth. The grits that arrived to the table were not only cold but we're undercooked as well the grit was likened to that of sand mix with cream of wheat.

The eggs over medium that arrived were nowhere near over medium they were more like over hard crispy.

When I ordered my pork-chops. I asked for them to be cooked medium and the waitress nodded her head in agreement with my request. Nothing was mentioned to me about the inability to cook these porkchops to that specification.

When The Pork-chops  came to the table. I quickly cut into them and was disappointed to realize that they were not medium but well done. I asked the server why my porkchops were cooked well done when I had clearly asked for them to be cooked medium. She responded by sending out the manager.

It was the manager who then advised me that the pork chops could not possibly be cooked to medium due to the fact that when they receive their pork chops those pork chops are vacuum sealed and  pre-cooked in a bag. So Cracker Barrels only job is to cut open the pouch and sear them up and make them appear to be cooked in-house when in fact they're prepared outside of Cracker Barrel somewhere else and then shipped vacuum packed already cooked to the store. 

Moreover, let's just talk about the texture of the meat of these porkchops. The first bite that I took was very very strange. Almost as if these porkchops have been manufactured in a factory somewhere. The meat texture was somewhere in the neighborhood of rubber cement and Charleston chew.

Any person who is worth anything in food service knows to come back and check with the customer after they have eaten at least two bites of their food and ask them how that food is. In this case the two bite rule was what I myself used to alert me to the fact that I needed to get up pay my check and run like hell.

In my opinion the place is horrible and overrated!"}
{"text":"Okay, let's get one thing straight right off the bat. the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because the employees are really nice, the general store is really cute, and overall, it has a very cozy, comfy, Litt-House-on-the-Prairie vibe going on.

One star is too much for the food they are serving. The grits were just a bowl of flavorless mush. No salt, no pepper, no butter. Nothing. Just flavorless slop.  The same goes for the gravy. Lukewarm, under seasoned, and clumpy.  The biscuits were okay. Too small and not enough butter for my taste, but they were the best part of the meal by far.  The sausage patties were tiny, tough, and I can swear they came out of a Jimmy Dean microwavable sausage packet.  The sausage patty in a McDonald's sausage McMuffin with egg is 10 times better.  Did I say 10 times? I meant a hundred!!  The menu says their bacon is apple-cured-and-smoked, fancy-schmancy, peppered something-or-other bacon. I must have ordered the Ralphs-plain-wrap bacon because what I got was three (small) slices of your everyday, standard, garden variety, regular ol' bacon.  The board in the country store says they sell loaves of fresh sourdough bread.  I ordered sourdough toast with my meal.  I'm almost certain it's the same sourdough bread I have in my pantry at home that I bought at the grocery store. Not sure why they wouldn't serve their fresh sourdough bread with breakfast.

Apparently, they have some kind of special flavored butter that they only serve upon request.  LAME!  What if it's your first time there and you don't know you're supposed to request it?  If a restaurant has an item that they are proud of and sets them apart from other restaurants, they should offer it up for free all day long so people come back for it! 

P.S. - I'm pretty sure I did request the special butter, it just never arrived.

Oh yeah, and what is with having to get up and go to the cashier to pay? Why can't we just pay the waitress? There are tons of them all over the place!!!

If you are visiting from out of town, it is a cool place to check out on your way out of Dodge. But, if you're looking for breakfast, look about 50 yards east and you'll see Denny's.  \"Moons Over My Hammy\" baby!!!!"}
{"text":"Our thoughts are still out of this tourist type trap.
We went for dinner and were not really that impressed as we were give 3 different waitresses during the first few minutes of sitting down. I really think they are still working out the kinks here with the staff and the food. The food is just ok and the portions are large but we both ordered salads and one one our sides and they finally came half way threw the meal.  While I do not think I would try hear again for dinner we want to give breakfast a try before we give our final opinion.  Also I am surprised that the setup for paying your check does not lead to a lot of walkouts by customers not paying the bill and stiffing the waitress - you can decide for yourself."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong dining at this restaurant! It's a good ole' family country vibe when you dine here. The prices are always reasonable and there are so many things on the menu to choose from. 

Every time my family comes, we always play an intense game of checkers, sit in the rocker, or the table games while we wait. If you're planning to eat here on Sundays, get there early enough to put your name on the waitlist. Especially for the one we visit in Atlanta.

Overall, this specific location is usually timely with getting us seated. Our waitress was such a sweetheart and hospitable."}
{"text":"Today we dined in for lunch. They are usually busy, often with a wait depending on the time of day. Today we were able to be seated right away, however there were very few empty tables in the packed restaurant. Our drink orders were taken right away by our waitress who introduced herself with a warm greeting . I am more impressed with their breakfast menu than lunch and dinner, but breakfast is served all day! I tried the Fish Fry, which was good. The cod was breaded and cooked very tastefully. The service was good throughout the whole meal and we were also greeted by the manager. Once your meal is complete, you take your check to he store area where you can browse before finalizing your check at the cashier."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Also that they have a little store connected to the restaurant. My favorite part of this places is they serve you breakfast at anytime I have gone there and ate breakfast at 1pm. There biscuits are delicious. I love their Seasonal stuff I recently went and ate pumpkin spice pancakes with over hard eggs and turkey bacon the only sad part about my trip there was not having enough room to finish my delicious pancakes!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Cracker Barrel and I am happy I did!! It was delicious!!! I ordered the meatloaf and it was so moist and tender and delicious. My sister had the Sunday chicken special Oh em gee!!!! That was super yummy!! Super moist chicken. We also got the lemon pepper fish which was delicious!!! We came back hone to Vegas and went to our local Cracker Barrel and I must say the food was not as good. This location set the bar and expectations. Our server Timothy was excellent!!! He needs a raise!!! Thanks assign Timothy!!! Great service!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were blissfully unaware of the bigotry supported by Cracker Barrel and have since stopped going.

This location is often understaffed and unable to handle the weekend crowds anyway."}
{"text":"Here with 8 people bad service 2 hour wait was told 1 hour. They didn't offer us our bread first, we had to ask a manager and he was rude and didn't seem like he had a care in the world. People that I'm with said it's really good food we it might be but I'll still never come back. Slow rude and a lack of respect. It's really sad..."}
{"text":"Southern food! Great décor and an exciting shop inside! LOVE IT!!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Cracker Barrel!!

It's still very busy - the best thing I have discovered is their online waitlist. We will join the waitlist before we leave home and only have to wait a few minutes for a table once we get there. 

Our favorite day to go is on Sundays when they offer their fried chicken special. I don't know what they are doing to this chicken, but it is amazing!! 

The last couple of times we've gone, the service has been questionable, but not bad enough to make me stop going there (yet). 

It's always fun the browse the store - they have a great selection of craft sodas and old school candies, as well as a bunch of trinkets and stuff. Does anyone actually buy that stuff?

Anyhow, they offer slings that sit in the chairs to secure your car seat if you need, which is great. My only real complaint is that the tables are all so close together. While I was pregnant, it was hard to be comfortable because my chair would always been slammed against by the person behind me."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see a Cracker Barrel on my way from San Diego to Phoenix!  I usually only get to eat there when I visit Florida.

Our server, Angela, was very accommodating.  I was on a very restrictive diet and she helped me pick what to eat.

The restaurant itself is very accommodating.  While we were eating, the manager unlocked and opened the back door so an elderly blind gentleman could more easily enter the restaurant.

The steak I had was surprisingly flavorful considering I asked them to cook it plain with no seasoning or butter (damned diet!)

I only wish it weren't so far from home."}
{"text":"Been here about 4 X's....keep hoping it will get better...nope! Went for lunch and had the grilled catfish, it was ok. The sides were awful! The turnip greens and green beans taste like nothing, literally. I won't be giving this anymore time or money."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved Cracker Barrel. This was my first time here and it definitely won't be my last. My husband and I drove into town after church last Sunday and were pleasantly surprised. I assumed it was going to be like Denny's or IHOP but it's so much better.  As soon as you walk in, it smells and looks like Christmas. We were initially given a 30 minute wait time but weren't even able to finish our game of oversized checkers when we were called. I ordered the chicken fried steak which came with THREE sides and ordered macaroni and cheese, fresh fruit, and mashed potatoes. I wasn't crazy about my mashed potatoes but my macaroni was fire. My husband ordered a biscuit with gravy breakfast platter, he wasn't a huge fan of their white gravy but I didn't have an issue with it. Our server was really attentive and while I didn't feel as if our food was taking too long he kept coming back to reassure us it would be right out and he kept our drink refills coming. I'm very much looking forward to coming back and trying their fried chicken, I really liked my steak but fried chicken is their Sunday special and both my husband and I kinda regretted not ordering it since it smelled and looked so delicious."}
{"text":"I give it two stars for the fast service. The pictures on the menu looked great but the food on our plates tasted awful."}
{"text":"So good. Huge portions for good quality, decently priced food. I love coming here for breakfast, and the Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola Cake is to-die-for. They are always super busy, so there's always a bit of a wait. However, I love looking around at the store (even though it can be a little crowded) while we're waiting. I almost always end up buying a little something."}
{"text":"foodis always good at Cracker Barrel.  Love the Country store too. I usually get ballsy here no matter the time of day.  Haven't had trout in so long I gotta have that."}
{"text":"We were wanting to grab a early dinner, before heading back home to CA.  We decided to come here, since there aren't any in CA and we've heard positive things.  We were greeted by a server name Michael, who was super nice and offered to get us our drink order.  I had their old fashion lemonade w rasperbhy syrup for an additional $0.10.  Omg it was very good!  Everything on their menu looked so good or was hard to decide.  We were given a plate of corn bread and soft biscuits, with butter and honey.  Very yummy, soft and moist.  As for their menu, there's so many to choose from.  Its def a southern comfort type of place.  I ended up ordering their chicken fried chicken, for their din plates you get a choice of 3 sides.  I got their Mac n cheese, mash, and corn.  It was very delicious and filling.  For those trying to watch your weight or wanting to eat more healthy, they have a section on their menu on the lighter side for calories.  The other half of the restaurant, is a store where they sell so many trinkets, candies, soda, candles, gifts etc.  very cute store!  A must visit when in AZ."}
{"text":"I enjoy it here every single time I come!

Service is always friendly and quick!

Usually when you order orange juice, it comes in a tiny cup.  Here you get a nice large glass of it!

And the pancakes are a must every single time!  Their syrup is always served warm, and it's the best syrup you can find!"}
{"text":"I'm always a big fan of Cracker Barrel everywhere I go. I am in love with their Grandpa's breakfast with chicken fried steak. This time I had gotten my food to-go, I asked the gentlemen at the host stand to recommend something. One said he hasn't tried much of the food so wasn't very much help (I worked in the service industry and even if you don't eat the food, at least figure out what customers favorites are so you can always have things to recommend, but this is not why I took the 1 star off), the other host said he has tried everything on the menu and recommended the baked white fish so I bravely ordered something new with hash brown casserole, fried okra, and turnip greens as my sides. I took the food back to my hotel, and I find out they didn't give me a fork or napkins. Perhaps this is my fault for not looking in the bag before leaving, but they didn't offer either. Which their location is by the airport next to a bunch of hotels so it should be something they are accustomed to.

 Nevertheless, the fish was delicious, lightly breaded with crumbs. The fried okra was average, a few pieces were too dry and burnt. The turnip greens were amazing, it was juicy, soft, and it has a flavorful shredded meat mixed in it. The hash brown casserole was great as always. I will always find a cracker barrel where ever I travel, but I just need to be more mindful about asking for to utensils.

*adding to original post: I went back again to this location and ordered the Meatloaf dinner, something new that I have never tried before. This time as my sides I ordered the turnip greens, sweet baby carrots, and green beans. This time again, I didn't have utensil in my to-go order but I remembered to ask for it before i left. When i opened my order back in my hotel, one thing that was a big difference then my last visit was that my turnip greens was in the same to-go box versus last time they put it in a separate small box and wrapped in wrap because it has so much juice. So a bit of inconsistency there in the to-go system. However, don't let the negatives and small things fool you, I am still a fan of cracker  barrel."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as a big advocate of Cracker Barrel in general. Every city I travel, I know I wont be disappointed. Not to sound like a broken record, but my favorite is the Grandpas breakfast with hash brown casserole. I decided to get the apple dumpling dessert here and to my big surprise, they do not peel the apples here in the apple dumpling. Call it picky, but other two previous Cracker Barrels that I have gone to, they peel the apples. It tastes much better and when i told the waitress that, she simply shrugged it off. When my friend also complained that his berry dessert was only half of what it should be (completely deflated and only half the bowl), she didn't offer to take it back or anything, just kind of laughed it off. Most likely, we probably wouldn't have sent our food back simply because I use to work in the food industry, but I know its just simple etiquette to at least offer. Nevertheless, I will still continue to go to Cracker Barrels no matter what. Good food at a GREAT price."}
{"text":"My friend just had a hair in his food that was at least a foot long. Waitress took it off he bill but said the manager was \"too busy\" to come over. Meanwhile the place is almost empty. It's not that hard. Wear a hair net. Meanwhile all the waitresses are walking into the kitchen without them. Hair in food is unacceptable. But hair in a food handled in a matter of fact way - because it clearly happens all the time - is disgraceful. I expect more from cracker barrel. It was one of my fave pleases to eat. But now I will never ever eat at one again."}
{"text":"Usually this chain is good from what I've experienced in other states and locations. However this one usually forgets to bring you things you ask for like coffee or hash browns. They resolve when you remind them once they make it back around to your table. Today was no different, went in with family and tried the pork chop, came out cold and so hard and dry it was not chewable. I thought it was a joke. I had my wife try it just to confirm. Tasted like it was over cooked hours ago and set aside. After wife told waiter and they offered another I didn't want it. Manager came over and took $3 off my meal for it since I ate the side which came with the meal. I've only done this twice before in my life and both times at different restaurants they would not charge me for the meal. Wasn't about the money as much as the gesture. Like $3 off will make us want to return. Not happening. That's the resolve on the management level. Sad."}
{"text":"if only i had a southern accent, i would have fit right in! but it didn't matter, because i got the whole southern experience and hospitality all the same!

so satisfying!

very cute country house with all of the trimmings a la paula deen. rocking chairs, checker boards, lots of cracker barrels of course, wooden stilt tables and chairs, a live fireplace (perfect for the 24 degree snowy weather right now), oil lamps, and the comforting aroma of butter butter all around!

the menu leaves you spoilt for choice, from country fried steak, to meatloaf, to hickory smoked pork ribs for your mains. the sides also range from side to side (hehe, get it) from whole kernel corn, turnip greens, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, and hash brown casserole. when it came down to it, i put together my own country platter, with beef stew, buttermilk biscuits, kernel corn, and hash brown casserole! after that meal, i was seriously ready to brave the cold!

small details like attentive service, board game to play on our table, and serving breakfast all day makes this an adorable find indeed! and what's not to love about the store connected to the restaurant? perfect for a lost urbanite like me! selling corn muffin mix, apple pie, all of the old school candy (cracker jack, moonpies, peeps, sugar galore), and southern memorabilia (watch out: junk) , it sure is fun to peruse.

apparently it's a chain in the south, but it sure doesn't feel like it! not bad for boontown, OH.

now i want to try their chicken pot pie.."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot, Cracker Barrel is one of the most consistent brands I have ever encountered. On this particular morning, I went with their new \"special\", a whole grain and granola pancake breakfast which also came with two eggs and a meat. Good Lord, that's a lot of food. I ate the two eggs (cooked perfect 'over medium' as ordered), a bite of the bacon (salty as usual) and barely half of the pancakes. I was stuffed.

Service was good. The waitress refilled my coffee and my friend's unsweet tea often. No hassle that we were waiting on two others who failed to arrive.

A slight bump at the register, but these things happen. Something about a check that wasn't closed properly meant that the clerk couldn't take a payment until it was solved. That took a few minutes to get the manager up front to override."}
{"text":"What? Another Cracker Barrel? Why not. When you really just want a known quantity for breakfast and you don't want to go wandering too far off the Interstate, you can't go wrong with it.

Biscuits and gravy. Grits. Really salty ham. Overly spiced sausages that give you the burps all afternoon. Yay for Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"I stopped in today for a brunch after picking up a rental car for the long ride on I-85 south. I was seated immediately and my waitress took my coffee order while I looked over the menu.

When my meal arrived, I was amazed at the quantity of food. Two eggs, hash brown casserole, a nicely cooked pork chop (their sausages and ham are extremely salty, this wasn't at all) plus grits and gravy. The eggs were cooked exactly as I ordered and my coffee cup was refilled often. So much food wasted though - I was stuffed

Great food, great price, great service. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Consistent execution at Cracker Barrel, which does an excellent job of being exactly the same whether you're in Charlotte NC, Glendale AZ or Palm Coast FL. With the exception of a few that are right to left where most are left to right, they are as cookie cutter as they can possibly become. The only thing that might possibly be different about this one is that it's not on an Interstate highway. They are usually within a quarter mile of an exit. Odd.

Otherwise, same hostess, same menu, same food, same service. I'm a fan.

They've recently introduced some slightly healthier options. Though the portions remain the same - massive. I had the granola pancake breakfast, which comes with two eggs (scrambled, please) and a meat (turkey sausage seemed like the best choice) and a plate that had three ginormous pancakes that were over the edge. And two bottles of maple syrup. I was hungry, so I did manage to eat a good bit. But there was still enough left to feed a homeless person for a week."}
{"text":"As you can tell from my reviews, I'm a big fan of the Cracker Barrel. Yes, it's totally a chain restaurant and each one is exactly the same as the next. Whether you're in Deerfield Beach FL, Emporia VA or Glendale AZ, you really can't tell! It's the same Southern style menu (fried okra!) and the same friendly staff and the same shop full of trinkets that I'm sure are only as gifts for grandchildren!

Even though it was dinnertime, my stomach wanted breakfast. There's nothing wrong with that at the Barrel, where they hand you the lunch/dinner menu as well as the breakfast one. Eggs, biscuits, grits. What's not to love?"}

{"text":"I HEARD SO MANY GOOD THINGS... before the vegas location opened. I was easily disappointed. I came with my whole family which was about 3 or 4 tables earth of people. They accommodated us nicely despite how busy it was and how cramped the dining area is buuut my issues were mostly with their food. First the portions were so small!!! My cousin finished his food with the quickness before mine even came out. I was excited fo dat hashbrown casserole but it had some hard parts and just seemed like it had been sitting out for awhile. They food was so bland and didn't have much taste. Also their cornbread is not the sweet type because I thought it was going to be. One good thing I have to say is that our servers were pretty great especially since we had such a large group. But still i definitely wont be back."}
{"text":"I would love to give Cracker Barrel 2 stars because the food was boring.  However, this Cracker Barrel doesn't deserve to be villified just because I'm not a huge fan of corporate food.
I went, I ate, it was pleasant.  I really found nothing to make me want to go back.  But I also found nothing to complain about.  That's about as far as I can go with this.
Sorry!"}
{"text":"Lunch today was my first time at the Cracker Barrel, and probably my last.  I had their combination plate, featuring a slice of ham, chicken and dumplings, and meatloaf.  The meatloaf was good, the ham OK, and the dumplings a strangely gelatenous texture.  Cut up white chicken accompanied the dumplings.  In their defense, one of my dining companions said her mom used to make them the same way, but I like my dumplings light and fluffy.  Nothing was served hot, barely past warm.  No beer and wine offered at all, but I was there for lunch, so not a big deal.  The service was great, and everyone friendly, which is why I bumped up the rating from a 2 to a 3.  I guess it's a good value for the money though (my plate was around $8 or $9), if you're not too picky about your food."}
{"text":"Here for the Coke 600 and ate here the morning of the big race and it was hands down the best breakfast I've ever had. Everything was on point and tasted amazing and the staff was more than friendly despite being very busy. Would tell anyone to go here. Great place!!"}

{"text":"When we head toward Phoenix, I typically stop at the Buckeye location because its the first one we bump into after crossing the AZ / CA border.  By the time we get here, its usually lunchtime and we're starving.  

Its a Cracker Barrel.  You see one, you've basically seen them all.  However, for some of us who don't have a Cracker Barrel in our state (ie: California), we relish the chance to come here.

Upon walking in, you're greeted by the general store, full of merchandise.  Head toward the back and find the Hostess podium to check in and place your name.  

On this particular Saturday afternoon, there was no wait for our group of 6.  At first the hostess tried to seat us next to the hostess station.  I'm not fond of getting a continuous stream of foot traffic while eating, so we asked for a different table. We were seated in the back.  Fortunately one of my friends looked at her seat.  There was water all over the seat, probably from the bus tray they used to clean the table.  We had to swap out our chair, and report it.  

Our server Paige was friendly but not the brightest.   We asked her for the Soup of the Day, and she actually told us \"I don't know\".  She thought it was vegetable.  We asked her to go find out. She finally came back and told us the soup of the day, and we each placed our order for food.  We also asked her another question about the menu, which she didn't know.  

The food came out fine, but she was terrible about refilling drinks, especially my friend's cup of coffee, which we had to ask twice.  She also forgot to give him butter, but lucky there was plenty of butter with the biscuits.

Three stars for the service.  It was average.
The food at Cracker Barrel is always the same.  Its American comfort food, where the portions are decent, its tasty and the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Comfort food, but potions underwhelming.

Like many other Yelpers, we've been to more than 1 Cracker Barrel. We jumped with joy that this is the closest location to California, without having to drive to Yuma, Arizona for our fix.  This place is truly a comfort southern food  establishment, from getting grits to fried anything to chicken and dumplings.  Most of the food is in the \"yellow\" category so if you're looking for fresh vegs and fruits, this may not be your place.

With that being said, the portions here are puny. I said it.  Compared to my last experience in well, anywhere USA, I was so disappointed that Las Vegas serves up kids size portions compared to their other restaurants.  Normally I could share my sides with someone, and in my last visit, we hoarded our food.

They also need to figure out how to make a biscuit and cornbread. The biscuit I had was pale (as in no color) and the cornbread was hard as a rock.. you could use it for batting practice.  Even with the apple butter, it was not good, and it would take too long to flag down a server to replace both breads.

If you're a fan of CB, then stop by.  If you come on weekends after 8 am, expect to wait over an hour.  Tip: Go to the CB website and add your name to the wait list.

There is a store finally coming to California in Victorville. They have not broken ground yet, but I sure hope they are not underwhelming like this vacation."}
{"text":"Located across the street from the Gila River arena / Westgate Entertainment district.  Whenever I come to town for a Coyotes/ Ducks game, I make it a point to stop here for breakfast before heading back to California.  

This visit was no different.  We arrived around 8:45 am on a Sunday, and just beat the weekend morning crowd.  We got a table in the middle near the window, and had a perfect view of the fireplace and the mounted deer head.

If you've been to a Cracker Barrel, the service is usually just ok.  This place is no exception.  We had to wait a bit for our server, and rather than taking drink orders, she just went ahead and asked if we were ready to order.

My friend Jack ordered first, and said COFFEE.  Then he ordered his meal.  We also spelled out that we wanted plenty of cream for the coffees.  After we all ordered, the server came back with an assistant to bring out juices, waters, and cups for the coffee along with lots of cream!  

My meal and Stephen's meal came with biscuits, gravy, and butter/ preserves, and if I wanted apple butter to ask.  So I asked.  The apple butter came on a side bowl, and it was delicious!

The food isn't spectacular, but it is American comfort food.  Pretty much any Cracker Barrel you visit will have the same tasting food.  They pretty much all look alike, so if you're a creature of habit, and don't like change, this restaurant is for you.

4-stars for this visit.  Good food, but the service could improve."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the overpriced places near the stadium.  If you are looking for breakfast before the game, walk about a 1/2 a mile here!  Cheap, good and great service all in the air conditioning, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I really like Cracker barrel although wont get tea ever again. The bottom of the water pot was not clean but very dirty. Sorry i had already completed one half of my tea before I saw the bottem when poring it in my cup. Bad news Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast a couple of days ago. I got the Cracker Barrel Country Boy Breakfast w Sirloin Steak, eggs, grits, apples , and biscuit and gravy. The steak was rough didn't really taste amazing but it wasn't disgusting but it's only 10 bucks so I'm not asking for the worlds finest steak. I asked for scramble Eggs and it didn't really looked scrambled at all. Just look like they cracked 3 eggs put it in like a rectangle in a pan and just slapped it on my plate(kinda like what McDonald's do to you). The grits was pretty good wish I had more of it though lol and the apples were amazing!! Biscuits weren't like the best in the world (not one of those restaurants you go to and be like ohhh there rolls/biscuits were killer)   And the gravy wasn't very warm when we first got it and it honestly looked and tasted like something I could cook myself (and that's sad because I am not a great cook at all lol) The service was good. Our waiter greeted us as soon as we seated and took our drinks, but it was a few times when my drink were left empty  unusually long. 

Overall, They gave you plenty of food for 10 bucks I was stuffed when I left and people have told me that they are known for there blueberry pancakes so I may try here one more time and get that and if its not amazing I probably wouldn't  come here again."}
{"text":"Extremely overrated.  I come from Texas where we have Cracker Barrel's everywhere. This Cracker Barrel is an embarrassment to the name. The food is bland and under seasoned. Not only that, my wife found a hair in her hashbrown casserole and the server that handed me my food literally stuck his thumb into my eggs. It ruined my appetite to say the least. I would stay away from this place. It blows my mind to see how long of a wait they have sometimes."}
{"text":"Appetizing breakfast offerings and delectable pancakes! Also delicious jelly! I noticed the sausage was a little pink, but our server Windy explained how when smoked it looks like this. She assisted in substituting with bacon though. She was so pleasant, attentive, and beyond welcoming. When we go back, we will wait to be served by her."}
{"text":"Wait was 45 min.  I work in the industry so I know that can be as quick as 20 min.  It was.  Drink order was taken right away.  And then we didn't see our waitress for 25 min. When she did finally come around,  she blamed not ringing our food in on the kitchen. Saying they lost the check.  Wrong choice. Admit you made a mistake.  And more times than not people will understand.  Don't blame your kitchen,  when I can clearly see them pumping iron.  Poor service.  Shame on the manager for not taking better care of us.  1.Made us wait additionally to talk to him. You're on my time,  not the other way around.
2. Compt 10% for \"inconvenience\", which in itself is a inconvenience. 
You lost a table full of waitresses and ex-wait staff.  Poor visit.  None of us will be back."}
{"text":"The three stars is for the food only. I ordered the Eggs in a Basket with sausage and the eggs over easy. One egg was over medium and the other was practically hard boiled. I make these at home. Just a suggestion... make the hole in the bread smaller and the eggs won't overcook, but the bread will get toasted nicely. The waitress noticed and offered to have it remade, but I declined since it took a while to get the food in the first place. The sausage patties were dry and after one bite I offered them to my husband. The taste was not appetizing at all. My husband ordered the Sunrise breakfast. He enjoyed the breakfast but there were some egg shells in his eggs. 

Our server was Leah. She, along with everyone else we encountered in the store and restaurant were very welcoming. I don't know when we will be back. Some of the prices weren't any more competitive than some of the mom and pop places we frequent for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went for lunch Friday. Usually the food is very good but this time I was disappointed.  The pinto beans taste sour and chicken livers were not as good. Have to say though, this is not the norm."}
{"text":"I LOVE cracker barrel. Have never had a bad experience. Until today. They cannot properly accommodate large groups without issue. Came in put my name in with 9 people. Then one more showed. Someone in my group went to the podium and asked to add a person. She watched the attendant change our reservation from 9 to 10. After a 30 minute wait, which we expected, we were called. They had our name down and table ready for 6. We told them it was 10. So they said they have two tables, one for 6 one for 4. So we said okay. Walked to our tables to discover they were clear across the dining hall from each other. So we said no we want our table for 10. They said it would be another 25 minutes.  We said no, and decided to leave. They made the mistake and made zero efforts to resolve it. Not even an apology. Wont come back to this location ever again. Oh and note: I called to make a reservation prior to all this which they declined and said they do not accept reservations."}
{"text":"Breakfast has been relatively consistent, but our family experience at dinner this past Thursday:

1. Spoiled food;
2. Overcooked food;
3. Argumentative servers;
4. Absent supervision;
5. Argumentative shift management (when they're in the store, which they often were not);
6. Non responsive store management

Staff seemed very comfortable with me being in the kitchen getting:
A. Butter/cream/condiments;
B. Silverware/plates/napkins;
C. Etc etc 

Not sure what happened, but it seems like staff  were *quite* used to customers getting up/getting their own items, and arguing with customers. 

Family thoroughly offended; me thoroughly embarrassed. Posted here after 24 hours/no response from Cracker Barrel management."}
{"text":"Visited Madison for Christmas coming from California. We don't have a Cracker Barrel but been wanting to try it. 

Ambience/Interior: So cute and quaint inside. Like your entering grandmal's house. For new people, you didn't enter the wrong door, you have to walk through the store and look for the hostess booth. The restaurant is pretty large considering how small I feel Madison is. 

Service: We had an elderly lady seat us. She was a bit slow but so cute and sweet. Our waitress was a sweet lady who knew her menu well. She checked on us often. 

Food: I ordered the pot roast special which comes with mashed potatoes. Added a side of broccoli and Mac & cheese. Sides were small, but all had plenty of flavor. Daughter ordered the chicken biscuits with double side of hash brown casserole. She didn't like the cranberry sauce it came with it. But I think it made it taste better since the chicken didn't have much flavor. Hash brown casserole had plenty of onions which she loved. Husband ordered the country fried steak with mashed potatoes and a side salad. He loved it all. Especially the gravy. Most meals come with biscuits or corn muffins. They were ok. Not great. 

Parking/area: Plenty of parking. I feel like everywhere in Madison has adequate parking compared to California. Lol. 

No complaints. Tasted liked home cooking when we wanted it most while away from home. We plan on coming back and trying other things."}
{"text":"I ordered the catfish with a side of green side of okra my was served with plastic in it.Contacted the manager he says is just from the bag what do you want me to do about it. I told him to take it back-and bring me a fresh order. But what got to me is that the ask what do you want me to do about it we had no biscuits or cornbread for about 20 minutes after we got our meal. They claim they were just cooking it never had experience like this at a Cracker Barrel before will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always.  Could be a little warmer.  Service was fast and always came by frequently to check in."}
{"text":"pancakes were not cooked so raw in the middle , runny egg, gravy so cold it had to be spooned with a knife out of the serving bowl, ice cold coffee....what can I say, the manager was nice but  seemed quietly indifferent  for this sort of just plain bad food , a   shame, 'cause it could be so nice....."}
{"text":"People who like this food must enjoy hospital food or something. I've now been to this establishment twice on two separate visits to Las Vegas (breakfast and dinner). I have to say I don't understand the hype and I don't know how this place is open..
The ambiance is cool and most of the servers are nice. However the food is mediocre and needs to be seasoned with something other than air.
It gets the job done of satisfying hunger but leaves you feeling like you're missing something for sure. I give it two stars for environment, effort, and staff."}
{"text":"I love Cracker Barrel for Sunday morning, on the way out of Champaign food. Great way to end the weekend. All the food is good, esp the hash brown casserole, but we all knew that. 

I'm reviewing especially for service. Twice now, we've been with parties of at least 10. This past weekend? 14! Both times, we've been seated without much wait (no wait this past weekend...and who would expect no wait for 14...at a breakfast place...on Sunday), been served quickly, been given separate checks without a second word, and just had a totally painless experience. Orders are all correct, food prepared well for what it is. Good times. This past visit...3 of us went to put names in for everyone, expecting a wait, and they pushed a huge table together, and sat the scouting party, letting them just wait for everyone else to show up. All service I guess I wouldn't expect from a run of the mill, always busy breakfast place. 

So - visit this Cracker Barrel without fear. Order Grandma's French Toast."}
{"text":"It's everything you'd expect from a Cracker Barrel.  The service at this location is on point.  A good place to meet for a simple breakfast.  Just not on a Saturday or Sunday morning unless you're prepared to wait.  Outside of breakfast, I'm not impressed.  I'll hit up CB on the occasional road trip but otherwise I don't see this as a regular stop for me until I'm at least 65.  Even then, I hope to have broader horizons with so much time on my hands."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is so dependable for down-home American comfort food!  My boyfriend and I were in Phoenix, heading back to our part of town on I-10.  We decided Cracker Barrel would be the perfect stop for brunch.  The wait was 25 minutes that Sunday around 1pm.  We didn't mind, because we spent that time perusing the old-fashioned candy and timeless children's games in the gift shop area.  I also love checking out the latest and greatest kitchen gadgets and decorative plates, etc. in the gift shop.  I purchased a cute muffin pan with a snap-on lid perfect for bringing baked goods to work!  The food was outstanding and definitely fresh.  I love the apple cider in a mug too!  Mmm I think that's my favorite thing on the whole menu!  I can't get enough of that tasty cider!  The biscuits are so yummy too!  Cracker Barrel food never disappoints me.  The service was a bit short, since they were so busy, and that wasn't too cool, but I'm still giving this review 4 stars, because service is usually much better at this location."}
{"text":"We went on their third day open. The gift store is full of goodies. The staff is very friendly.
They gave a wait time of an hour, but it was more like 24 minutes. We hardly noticed, because we were in the rocking chairs talking and laughing.  I had the rainbow trout. It was very good and the portion sizes, are big. You definitely get your money's worth. Nice family style, relaxed, setting."}
{"text":"We tried to stay away from chain restaurants on our recent trip to the Phoenix area, but relented when we saw Cracker Barrel. There are times when I really can't turn down a chicken fried steak and this was one of them.

Service was good here. My drink never went dry. The other customers were what I always expect from a Cracker Barrel, no matter what part of the country I go to.

Food was good. Nothing wowed me, but everything had good flavor and I ate it all, so I guess that says something. 

They were really close to the new Cubs Park, so it was a good place to go after the game."}
{"text":"On our drive over to Phoenix from LA, this was a perfect stop for all. Of course it's cheap and filling, but the best part is that they serve breakfast all day. I had the Country Boy breakfast and it was amazing. Tons of food all for $8.99. I had the sirloin steak, but in hindsight, probably should have gotten the country fried steak. The sirloin was a bit tough and over cooked, even I asked for medium.

Lots of food and fairly quick for a sit down restaurant, this place had great service and is a treat on road trips!"}
{"text":"Most Cracker Barrel locations run about 3 stars for me. When you come here, you pretty much know what to expect when it comes to the food.

This Cracker Barrel is right next to Silverton Casino and is the first one in Vegas I believe. Due to this, and the location, this location gets PACKED!!! At one point, I got up to use the restroom and had to pass through layers of people waiting by the hostess stand. 

The reason for my two star review is the cramped space, poor crowd control, lacking and very slow service! 

When we were waiting to be seated, I was looking through the store. My family was waiting near the candy listening for our name. We had been told it would be 10 minutes or less to be seated. After 20 minutes or so, we finally asked how much longer. The hostess then said, \"Oh. I thought I seated you. Sorry. Just a few more minutes.\" Turns out she had skipped us. While waiting, another family came up to the stand and they too had the same issue.

After being seated, the waitress quickly took our order. Drinks came quickly. Coffee was being refilled quickly. 

The food took much longer than normal for a Cracker Barrel to come out. I ordered the pecan pancakes and a side of biscuits and gravy to share. When my gravy came out, it had a film layer from sitting and my food was all just barely warm.

If you have never been to a Cracker Barrel, I would say to go. For a major chain that is in the Denny's type family to me, it's pretty good. If you have been, then I would say to skip this spot. It's way too hectic and it will probably be a letdown to you."}
{"text":"Love Cracker Barrel. The food is always amazing. Have been going to them for years. The location in Buckeye, AZ is no different. Food is great and service great. Our family of 4 always leaves full and happy. My favorite dish is the sunrise sampler because I love all they have to offer. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well let me say I have gone to this restaurant chain in other states.  The 1 1/2 hour wait is not worth it.  The portion size is small comparing to other locations and my food came out cold.  They did correct the cold food and gave me a different plate.  However the quality wasn't as good as other locations either.  Very disappointing will probably not return."}
{"text":"This location of Cracker Barrel is pretty consistent.    I feel that make an attempt to turn their tables quickly.  The wait is usually minimal.  Service is pretty fast.  Today we had breakfast.  Both of our orders came out correctly.  Our server was nice and knew her menu.  Our drinks were kept filled.  They have a good sanitation grade and the visible area seems very clean.  This location always meets my expectations with food and service."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is a southern country IHOP that reminds me of the quality that IHOP was in the late 90's. Yes I was a kid but I knew good service and what a fresh rooty tooty should taste like!

There is no way you will not be fascinated by their store in the front of the place. Nostalgia mixed in with a bit of patriotism and you've got yourself a winner. Everything from harmonica's to Sunkist fruit gems, who knew?

Their service was stellar. I showed up and placed a to go order but I interacted with 4-5 different people that all had specific jobs in the process instead of having 1 person do all the work. Run on sentence bragging worthy.

The food was good for it being a chain. I ordered the sunrise sampler and an order of flapjacks (kidding, they're actually pancakes on the menu).

Sunrise Sampler

The Grits and Fried Apples: These comes separately but they don't hurt together. The grits were of perfect consistency and the apples a bit over sweetened but hard to tell once you mixed them in there.Just remember, if she fix you eggs and grits in the morning, you should tip her. 3.75/5

Hash brown Casserole: I respect any place that doesn't give you old fashioned potatoes/hash browns. It was lightly cheesed enough to give you a flavor and texture that was different from the boring ass ones you get everywhere else. 4/5

Bacon, Ham and Sausage...I liked them in that order 3.5/5

Forget the gravy...but that might only be because THEY FORGOT TO GIVE ME MY BISCUIT. What's Cracker Barrel without a biscuit? I don't know yet because the only time I've been to one, I didn't get one :D 

Pancakes 

Surprise, Surprise...These pancakes are quite a treat. I can't explain them as they're unique in the sense that I cannot say they taste like other or combinations of other pancakes that I've had. Or maybe it was that pure maple syrup in a souvenir like bottle that got me. 4/5

Don't skip on the cracker, you can come up on an \"I'm Just A Bill\" shirt and really good pancakes under the same roof."}
{"text":"I only ate here because we were celebrating a friends birthday and this is where she wanted to go. It will never be my choice for a restaurant. Looking at my receipt the portion sizes were slightly less than I would expect for the price I paid. I think most everybody was satisfied with their food. I do feel the sides were slightly smaller than they should be. Especially my friends dish where she got the fish and she chose seasonal fruit as one of her sides and she got three strawberries and three chunks of pineapple. As for my food the only thing that did not live up to expectations was the fried apples which did not have much flavor at all. The service was mediocre. We were a party of 12 but they put two servers on our table and the service was still mediocre. Overall disappointing experience that I don't care to repeat."}
{"text":"My server Gab was incredibly attentive, friendly, and all around awesome. Thanks for the awesome service Gab"}
{"text":"Only thing good about this place is the okay-tasting food. Service was subpar, food was delivered with no eating utensils. When I asked other walking by servers for some, I was responded with a curt reply with no eye contact. We waited at the hostess stand for more than 5 minutes with another very rude and impersonal Hostess. Overall experience was mundane, not very likely to come back in the future. Would recommend even IHOP over this place!"}
{"text":"Why does this take so long?!  So disappointed. Even they are not too busy on Wed night, but all the servers did not move. We have been waited for almost 45' before getting server got my orders then we had to wait another 30' for the food comes out. I expected the server could bring at least the bread and butter to keep my children snacks. Anyway first time would be my last too!"}
{"text":"So much hype for low quality food. I had heard so much about Cracker Barrel that I was regretting not going when I visited Oklahoma. There was one across the street from the hotel.... so when we went to Las Vegas, I had to go try it. I was very disappointed. The food was horrible and the service lacked attention. I will NEVER return to a Cracker Barrel."}
{"text":"Our server was great but our food  took 45 minutes to come out to our table and the manager comes up and asked us if we need anything trying to comp us biscuits and corn bread but when our food fame to the table they forgot our order of biscuits and try to charge us for a two additional biscuits and gravy after they where trying to comp us. So after we get the check and we ask for the manager to see if she can fix our tab but no she asked us repeatedly everything was alright everything was brought out on time I don't know I just will not be here again. So much for my birthday"}
{"text":"This Cracker Barrel is right off 480 on the Tiedeman exit. Very close to the interstate. It's your typical Cracker Barrel. Country store for shopping and dining area for eating. There's a fire place and little games on the table to play with as you await your country fried meal. I like to order the catfish here. Can't go wrong with southern fried catfish!"}
{"text":".y husband and I ate at this Cracker Barrel location  tonight. It was not our first time visiting this restaurant. We were disappointed with  the service and the presentation of the food. The server/waitress did even bother to see if we had utensils. We had to ask another server for a set of utensils. My husband ordered the meatloaf, It looked like the cook or Chef just plopped it on the dish. Coincidentally, the customer's sitting behind us, also complained on how the meatloaf looked. My husband asked for an Arnold Palmer, the waitress give him water. I do not understand why she was so confused! Cracker Barrel was not busy at all. There is no excuse for this terrible service. As we were paying the bill, the Cashier asked us how was the service. We told her exactly how horrible it was. 
."}
{"text":"Serves seem to be getting worse. It wasn't even busy today and the server seemed like he couldn't manage his tables. Management needs to get on their servers about providing better customer service"}
{"text":"First time I'd been to Cracker Barrel in years! Just as fun and as crowded as I remember it. Staff is super accommodating and their pancakes are the best EVER! The crispy edges though? YES! Their juice is fresh squeezed and their service was prompt! Cracker Barrel Is always memorable breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"First time at a Cracker Barrel and wish there was 1 in NY closer to me... The food  was great, the atmosphere in the place was great and wasn't too expensive either. The service could have Been quicker but overall great!"}
{"text":"Totally recommend this Cracker Barrel. My family loves their biscuits, apple butter, hash brown casserole etc. Each time we come here we get great service and food is always spot on!"}
{"text":"I finally decided to give this new location a try after the hype of the opening had died down  and being familiar with this chain from other locations and states.  I went on a Tuesday around lunch time figuring that it would be slower but boy was I wrong. It was packed but the wait was only 10 -15 minutes no big deal.  Got seated refreshed myself with the menu then waited,  waited, and waited until finally someone came and took our drink order and said the server would be over soon  for our meal order. So then we waited, and waited, and waited like watching grass grow, then someone took our meal order but said our real server would be over soon. The place being packed was a good sign but wow are they under staffed or not prepared. I can't imagine what the place is like on a weekend seriously. The menu options are good on a positive note both breakfast and lunch options available and prices weren't too bad over all. We had to ask for our complimentary corn bread since it never made it to us before . Iced tea was good and little sweat. Meals were good , presentation was good too, but the service just sucked and the girl at checkout where you bring your bill to pay was miserable and rude. Id go back though for the food hoping that they've gotten better with time in the server dept."}
{"text":"Great food and service here. We came on a Sunday late morning for brunch and were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our brunch was delicious and served with a smile. Our server was attentive and pleasant. 

2/2018 - came for dinner. Food was good but service was terrible."}
{"text":"So this is the first time I went into Cracker Barrel... I was next store at AAA waiting for my car to get repaired. 

I ordered the old timer -- it was a LARGE breakfast all for 6.99. I ate the two eggs, the two turkey sausage patties and half of a biscuit.  Mind you this came with grits, gravy, apple butter, hash brown casserole, two biscuits, two eggs, and two sausage patties.... HUGE breakfast. 

I loved the apple butter! The biscuits were good, the gravy interesting, grits not sure about those things yet, sausage good, and eggs... well they are eggs. 

The coffee was good and the water tasted just fine. 

Not sure whether or not to visit again, but if I do, the apple butter for sure will be on my plate! 

And yes, they accept AMEX."}
{"text":"Year One Review Update:
Well I have now been here 5 times over the past year. The prices still are amazing and the food is good. Service on the other hand is so so. They are very cheap with the biscuits, we never get offers for seconds. The food itself I can endorse wholeheartedly. The country boy breakfast with a steak medium rare is still my go to dish when I come eat here!"}
{"text":"It's really not my favorite to give 3 stars, especially since it's not my first time at this location. The service was good, I honestly always have gotten great service here with a smiling face.

However for some reason the food was off, almost like it was left overs from the day before. Now I know this is not necessarily a made from scratch place, heck I know a a lot of the food gets nuked. But this time something was off. Chicken fried chicken looked and tasted like it was double fried. Macaroni was very greasy, with the grease oozing all over the plate. It was really not appetizing. 

Needless to say I never brought it up, mainly because I don't like to complain unless it's really bad. However when my coworker and I go to the car (I drove) to go back to work the dang milk man blocked me in my parking space. Really? If it weren't for the person beside me eventually leaving, along with another person blocked in I would have been stuck for who knows how long. 

Made me 20 minutes late coming back from lunch. Yes I do plan on going back, food wise I think they were just off that day. It's usually very good. As for the milk man, don't park directly behind customers. Even if it makes you having to walk farther, because next time I'm calling that number in your truck."}
{"text":"I went in having high expectations and was disappointed in the food. The service however was some of the best I've had recently. The server, Luis was very attentive to our group of 8 and the manager came over to say hello. That alone will have me back in the future. 
After our meal we explored the store and they had alot of cute home decor and gifts!"}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss for me. Usually order to-go and that experience can be aggravating. There's a LOVELY woman that frequently works as the cashier. Super friendly and very hard working. Unfortunately, it seems sometimes that she's the only one working and everyone else is busy having very dramatic conversations or holding up the countertops and hostess stand. I actually get frustrated for this woman because she is doing her job, along with everyone else's. I appreciate her efforts though, and that, along with the consistently good hash brown casserole, will keep me coming back. The rest of the food can be hit or miss."}
{"text":"My family was very disappointed in going last night. I have Celiac (gluten allergy) and I went in after checking a few websites expecting I could have a steak and some sides...I ask for their allergen menu and I can't have a single one of the entrees, and only a few sides/salads. No chicken, pork chops, fish, steak, nothing :( what a disappointment! They really should try to accommodate to other needs. It's seriously not that hard to have a gluten free steak or other piece of meat.

My dad was unhappy about how small the plates are getting, and my sister was unhappy with her food in general. The service was also very slow. Don't think we will be going here again! Have had amazing experiences at two other Cracker Barrels."}
{"text":"Jamie P. Was our server for breakfast she was very friendly and took very good care of our dining needs.... unfortunately some boy brought our food to our table dropped the monkey dish of butters onto our table as my friend was drinking her hot coffee as a natural reaction she kind of jumped a little spilling her hot coffee on her arm and lap the boy didnt even seem to care much at all didn't even ask her if she was ok. He looked like a deer in headlights been trying to catch his name but he has avoided coming near out table. But the food was delicious and our real server was great.  Update: The boys name with poor service is Ernie we had to ask another employee what the boys name was since he continued to avoid us. Ernie needs some more training in how not to drop dishes onto tables and how to apologize for his mistakes. Thank you."}
{"text":"What better place to take your father than to Cracker Barrel on Fathers Day!? Well this was my dad's one request so I humored him and I was not disappointed.  We came in here for breakfast at around 7:30 am so we avoided any crowds or wait time which was nice. We settled down into a comfortable seat by the window and our server attended us rapidly. 
Coffee here is hot and good tasting and service is fast but friendly! I ordered the \"Old timer's breakfast\" which comes with a couple eggs, bacon, fried apples, and biscuits. What more could you ask for?
 Service here is quite efficient so we received our food in a timely manner.  I can tell that customer care is top notch here. And my father and I both value that very much. 
  Breakfast was delicious and I was more than happy with my selection.
So thank you Cracker Barrel for making my dads Father's Day start off great!"}
{"text":"This place sucks . The wait time is ridiculous.  The waitress couldn't remember what she had to bring to the table. I asked for a water 4 times before finally getting a cup after my meal. After 45 minutes of waiting I was served frozen breaded chicken with some type of gelatin gravy sauce. My family were left with thick pancakes . I only tipped out of common courtesy. Needless to say this place will never get my money again."}
{"text":"A 3.5 really.

Food is consistant and manager will replace what  fails...

Always come when my mom visits: it is her ultimate favorite place to eat.  Unfortunately no senior menu so minus a half star there.

Not top notch, but the biscuits and corn bread makeup for lack of freshness (as a veggie lovers, a minus on that..)."}
{"text":"I used to go to the Cracker Barrel in MA when I was younger and I always enjoyed it. I didn't enjoy this one, however. The servers are trying to get you out of there quickly, and the food is nothing to write home about. I was constantly bumped by the table bussers, and only one apologized. One waitress almost dumped tea from her pitcher on my head. Customer service wasn't great, and overall my husband and I just weren't impressed. I'd say if you want breakfast, brunch, or anything country-style, you're better off trying somewhere else."}
{"text":"Spent 45 mins of my 60 minute lunch waiting for a fruit and yogurt parfait and a glass of ice water. 
Not at all impressed with the service at this location and will not likely return. Too bad, because it's 2 minutes from work and I like their food."}
{"text":"I havent been to cracker barrel forever, so i was willing to wait 50 minutes for breakfast at 10:15 am. I was finally called. I was outside with my 3 toddlers, as we were making our way into the restaurant, there were so many people, blocking the path. By the time we made it to the restaurant seating, they called us twice and gave our table away. I was disappointed.  I had to wait another 10 minutes to get a table. Then we were finally seated. Our food took forever. I asked for my kids pancakes to come asap since they havent had any breakfast. It still took a long time. Finally a manager brought the kids some biscuits and a small cup of fruit. Our food finally arrived. I had their country breakfast with the sirloin steak. Ordered it med rare, came out med well. Sent it back. By that time i was full from eating everything else. I also had the turnip greens. Why does the food taste different then the restaurants back east? The food was just not as good in my opinion."}
{"text":"service was great and the store is amazing, but the food is just terrible. No flavor the chicken tenders that came out looked like trash, biscuits and gravy were not even something i would give to me dog. I would go back to the store but that's it"}
{"text":"I had Cracker Barrel the first time last year. I'm glad there is one here in Vegas. My girlfriend has never been and I wanted to show her why I loved this place so much...but to my dismay I was disappointed and embarrassed that I raved so highly about this place.

Parking lot isn't bad, upon entrance you have the segmented parking for the restaurant and of course the vast parking lot from the casino. It's good though. We came around 830am, we knew it would be busy and may have had to wait. We only waited a couple minutes. It was busy. 

Walking into the dining area, it's cramped, but decent. They should've expanded it just a tad, or add outdoor seating it's perfect during the fall and spring months. Anyways, our drink order was taken, then a few moments later our breakfast order. My girlfriend and I ordered Grandpas Country Breakfast. About 10 mins later our food was brought out by this rude server she was skinny, tall and platinum blonde short hair...she threw our plates at us. Literally didn't say anything, just threw the plates in front of us and left, didn't bring our Apple butter or ask if everything looked right which my girlfriend got the wrong meal.

Luckily we had a server in training who came by to check on us and noticed that my girlfriend had received the wrong meal and went to change it immediately. 

Getting a refill on my coffee was nearly impossible, no one ever came around. And my eggs were undercooked for an over easy egg. 

Of course we will try this place again, I want to be able to give it 5 stars instead of 3, but the 3 is for the chicken fried chicken."}
{"text":"Sausage patties - burnt
3eggs breakfast isn't 3eggs
Food presentation was poor.
Muffin was served ice cold. 
Server dejanique cleaning her crusty eyes, when she greeted us and took order. Asked for water and never got it... wtf."}
{"text":"I have been to several Cracker Barrels, and expect pretty much the same quality food and decent service.  Tonight's experience was terrible.  Stephanie W, our waitress never refilled our glasses.  We had to flag her down, several times, to get her attention.  She brought only 2 biscuits for 2 people, and when we asked for more, she told us that was all we could have.  Soup was cold, we had to send it back. I think it was b/c she brought it late (after the entree was brought).  My grilled catfish was very small, and undercooked.  It was a lackluster meal, at best."}
{"text":"This location is very mediocre. It took over 10 minutes for someone to notice that we didn't have drinks and by then I had already told another waiter. I've never had an issue with Cracker Barrel until I came to this one. Waitress didn't even apologize for the wait and came off very careless. I had a burger and it wasn't very good either. I'll just stick to breakfast with this restaurant."}
{"text":"I know it's opening week, and yes I expected a long wait... No big deal BUT when my steak arrived all bloody when I ordered it well done ( I'm immune suppressed) that was it. Everything went downhill from there. They made me another meal,which took 20 minutes to make ( my son was done with his meal by then), but now the side dishes where cold on the new meal. The manager came to the table,I spoke to him about the situation but he was not listening.  I repeated that I'm immune suppressed and food not prepared properly can land me in the hospital. Oh did I mention they forgot my silverware twice! The final clincher was when the bill came. They charged me double... Once for the rare stk I sent back and then for the second stk that I actually ate. Get your act together Cracker Corner! It's not that hard to serve a meal that's HOT, cooked correctly and charge the appropriate amt on the customers check! After all this, it's 9:39 pm and we are just home after \"dinner\"...which BTW was an awful experience.  The end result? We where hastily offered ONE free desert \" if we were still hungry\". Oh and did I mention they do not do a military discount.  God Bless America!"}
{"text":"Yes...I admit it...I've a soft spot for southern food. CBs were reminiscent of the food I grew up with in childhood. Although not authentic in all flavors (to my memory), it certainly hit close to home anytime I was on the road. I was saddened to learn that there was nothing closer than AZ or Sacramento....

On a day of a craving, I hopped in the car, drove to this location and ordered my tradition: country fried steak, fried okra, biscuits, steak fries, mashed potatoes, and crumble for dessert. Service was good (consistent with the fellow CBs I've been to across the country) and food hit the spot."}
{"text":"We asked for soup and got some vegetable slop in a bowl that looked like it was the last of the vegetables at the bottom of the pan.  It was not soup and we sent it back.  I ordered cake and ice cream.  The cake frosting was gritty and the ice cream had bits of ice.  Cracker Barrel has gone down hill with their food.  I will not be returning.   The employees were nice.  If people think this stuff is hometown cooking you have not had good home town cooking."}
{"text":"My first time at a Cracker Barrel. I really enjoyed the raspberry lemonade and the huge portions of food! The homestyle chicken wasn't exactly the best I ever had but it wasn't bad at all. 4/5 stars is a fair rating for here."}
{"text":"Our first time here and our server Kia was awesome! She was so patient and helpful to our difficult orders. I've Been wanting to try this place and was finally able to while visiting my family here in Arizona.  Thank you for the great experience Kia"}
{"text":"I love this place! It was very busy today so the wait was unusually long due to the Holliday however the food and service we received was worth the wait. Their lemonade is basically sent from the heavens and eggs over medium is the only way to go. Apple butter on toast is their signature and the little store up front helps to pass the time while we waited for a table. The service was great even though the waitress was very busy and they double sat her. I love this place so much and I will for sure be coming back and recommend it to anyone :)"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because of the choices that you get and for the amount you get for the food.  With a majority of entrees you get to choose 3 sides. My group of friends and I's favorite include the mash potatoes with white gravy, macaroni and cheese, fried okra and cheese casserole.  Entrees we enjoy are the roast beef and chicken country chicken.  The lemonade is also made fresh, and who doesn't enjoy lemonade that was made just for you.  

Even though these are my go to dishes, they are just country dishes, but it's the ambience of old times that makes me come back. It feels comfortable and because it has a very neat store with the cutest trinkets and old style items that you wouldn't find in other places. Going to both the restaurant and store is a trip within itself. My fiancee recently bought a toy there (haha), I got the cutest salt and pepper shakers and some ginger beer. My friends got candy of brands you don't see in stores anymore, clothes, purses and signs with the best quotes."}
{"text":"Cracker barrel was just ok, nothing special. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and eggs with the hash brown casserole. Honestly, the best thing about the meal was the hash brown and the biscuits. The chicken fried chicken was decent, but the gravy made it smell like wet socks. It smelled like wet socks yall... what do you guys make your gravy with?!?!"}
{"text":"This is a great place with great food and great service they always have good coffee with unlimited refills. They also have the little store with a bunch of little nick nacks."}
{"text":"Was nice to finally see a cracker barrel in Vegas but this location has a long way to go to even live up to the average cracker barrel.  Service was fine about average but the quality of the food was pretty poor,  came in for breakfast ordered biscuits and gravy with eggs, best part of the breakfast was the coffee.  Gravy was so old it was like paste, the sausage was at best shoe leather and dry as sawdust. Did not even finish half the breakfast.  Pretty poor by cracker barrel standards and that's not setting the bar very high."}
{"text":"I was actually a little disappointed after my initial outing here.  A House Salad with some bacon pieces, Cherry Tomatoes, thin leaves of lettuce and seasoned croutons with a gorging river of Honey French Dressing glopped over it was good, but a bowl of Vegetable Beef Soup served in a hot metal crock was overrun with kernels of yellow corn.  And, while Mashed Potatoes covered by peppered Country Gravy were tasty, and my entree of Country Fried Steak, also slathered with the same gravy, only yielded one bad bite, a side of Cut Green Beans with a few pieces of bacon was overcooked.  The standout side was an excellent and very sweet (Natch!) Sweet Potato Casserole with Pecans.  Unfortunately, the Buttermilk Biscuits were cold and hard, taking away from the homey ambiance.  

Of course just a doorway away the ambiance was more like an overstocked country store, replete with candy from yore and all manner of gadgets, gizmos, and dooodads.  Adding to the commercial feel of this place from all vantage points, wooden rockers in front of the restaurant ostensibly for waiting diners were embellished with price tags.  

Service was mostly good, but a requested second salad dressing came late.

I will give this recent addition to North Las Vegas's culinary desert one more chance.  But I hope the cooking will live up to the early word of mouth hype heard soon after it opened this location.  If a place that touts itself as a local home-cooking emporium does not wow with comfort food, it's time to seek out another one that does.

XXX-1/2 stars overall on a first visit"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a meal at the good old Cracker Barrel?  They all feel the same where you walk though a little shop to eat your meal.  The food is always decent.  Plus they always have apple cider.  :)    The service at this location was good."}
{"text":"It's been three excruciating months since I first tasted the piece of heaven that is Cracker Barrel pancakes. I have even considered renting a car and driving to closest Cracker Barrel (which is like, an hour away in the middle of Nowhereville, New Jersey) JUST to taste those elusive pancakes. Don't remember much about our other meals because the pancakes just outshone everything else.. BUT i remember an overall awesome experience. On top of that, they have a novelty/knick knack store to browse while you wait for a table."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes to get served.  Second time that happened.  Won't be returning until new management is in place.  This is ridiculous coming from a good chain restaurant."}
{"text":"With visitors in town, we of course had to hit up all the southern classics. Cracker Barrel was a chain they didn't want to miss. 

The storefront is charming and inviting. Decor also matches. The gift shop though, sells only useless junk. As my friends were looking for souvenirs to take home, we quickly realized that there wasn't much to offer besides tin can chickens that don't fly too well in suitcases. 

Food is decent. They offer many traditional comfort meals. I had chicken and dumplings. Dumplings were moist yet rigid and a pretty satisfying meal. 

Overall decent place to grab breakfast or lunch. Not one of my regular spots, but I do like coming here for a fix every once in a while."}
{"text":"This place was busy but the waiting time was minimal. Food was very good and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"When you are picking up someone at airport and it's 6a where to go for breakfast? Cracker Barrel. A little chilly this early in the morning so it was so nice they had a wood burning fireplace going.  Sons girlfriend ordered blueberry pancakes. Loaded with fresh blueberries and 3 huge fluffy cakes. Son chose chocolate chip pancakes and not just a small handful  loaded with chocolate chips. He had scrambled eggs and crisp bacon.  I had grits ..Def not like myrtle beach.. but not horrible. And not a biscuit personm. But whenever at CB I have to get them  fluffy. Def not dry. And scrambled eggs.  Enough food that do not need to have lunch.   Love walking thru the country store  so many ideas for gifts for Christmas!"}
{"text":"I didn't realize (at the time of my purchase) that Cracker Barrel utilizes CISCO foods.  By this I mean, CISCO delivers in mass amounts the food.  CB simply heats (microwaves) and there you are.  I did not know this until the waitress (very nice gal, by the way) told us.  We had a horrible beef meal, left CB and then I researched this info.  She was right!"}
{"text":"Since there's no 3.5 option I'll bump them up to 4.  Good food, great biscuits, good service, and a nice clean atmosphere.  Also has a neat little gift store attached with a great selection of old school candy and snacks."}
{"text":"My husband and son enjoyed their meals. I ordered the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, carrots, and lima beans. The vegetables were terribly soggy and mushy. The mashed potatoes were hard and dry as if they'd been sitting around for a while. And the chicken tasted like it had been doused in maple syrup. Gross!!!!!!!!!!! The server was nice and the store is cool but I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Best country food in the area. 

Great prices.

Order ahead to save time. Usually order ready when they say.

They should put whipped butter and honey with all to go orders. 

Trout is super here. Catfish too."}
{"text":"Yeah the wait is a Little long because it's new, but walking around the store makes it go quickly. Our server Stuart was amazing. Great job."}
{"text":"This is really about the wait time.
Knew it would be long, but 2 hours?
Really?
Cannot wait for the second store to open, hope it reduces wait time."}
{"text":"This is a RACIST RESTAURANT, if you are any other ethnicity other than Caucasian, you will be mistreated. TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.
The hostess was incredibly RUDE, DISCOURTEOUS & DISRESPECTFUL. I walked in & said \"hello\" to the hostess who was standing alone because there was no wait at the restaurant. She looked at me & with a roll of her eyes said \"how many\" no returned greeting. I answered \"for 5\". She took a deep breath & said \"there's no room\" as a manager walked by & asked her \"how many\" she replied \"5 but there's no room\" Why is this hostess being so incredibly rude???  Restaurant was half empty & no one waiting & no one is being rude to her??? It was very clear that we were not wanted.  The hostess & manager were both Caucasian.
So much so that for the first time ever, my 16yr old son & 12yr old daughter saw how we were being spoken to & treated that they told me \"mom, I don't want to eat here. Can we go somewhere else? They don't like us\". 
Coincidentally while waiting 2 older Hispanic ladies walked out of the restaurant & I walked up to them to ask them how the hostess treated them & to no surprise, they said \"rude, she was so rude\" which only confirmed to my family & I that THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS RACIST. 
We were clearly being mistreated because we are of Hispanic descent. First time ever being treated like this. This experience showed my children that even though you will encounter discrimination, you will stand your ground demonstrate respectful behavior to those who do not deserve it. However, that doesn't mean you will return to the same establishment & you will share your terrible experience with others. So other people don't bring their business here. 
We magically got seated in 10 minutes after being told 1 hour by the manager after seeing me speak to the 2 ladies who had just walked out.  There was 5 tables for 6 people open Every patron in that restaurant was 40+yrs old & Caucasian.
We however had 1 very friendly server named Armando. After a 30min wait for our food, it was brought out & we were told they ran out of Mac n cheese on 3 out of 5 of our orders. We had to order other sides & wait for those to come out.  
What a terrible experience (minus our server) & we will tell anyone who will listen to NEVER GO TO A CRACKER BARREL."}
{"text":"I've had hit and miss experiences with Cracker Barrel food.  This location however, is good. Our server was Aaron, and he was courteous and willing to put up with an obnoxious manchild and his mother.  He was attentive and I couldn't ask for better.  The food was about what I expect.  It's ok diner type food.  I had the country boy.  My ham was good, hash browns were good, and grits were well, grits.  Eggs were cooked a little too long but nothing to throw a fit over.  The atmosphere and the store make for a good dining experience.  Thank you Cracker Barrel, much appreciated."}
{"text":"Country breakfasts are the reason we stop by this location and it is right off the 101.  Pancakes are served with hot, HQ maple syrup in those little mini bottles - usually 2 of them, so if you're judicious in syrup use then you can take the spare bottle home!  Eggs and hasbrowns are normally good, and their hash brown casserole is popular, but just not something I enjoy very much personally.  

Laid back atmosphere here and I love the fact that most of the servers are more mature and advanced in years.  I feel at home."}
{"text":"Worst steak I had there.. came out burnt and so damn dry couldn't even finish it.. even Waffle House so call steaks taste better! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Not worth an hour wait at all!! The iced tea was good, server was good, food sucks! The mashed potatoes had no flavor at all, I even added butter salt and pepper and there was no helping them. The mac n cheese tastes like frozen stouffers crap. The chicken tenderloins were like frozen chicken strips. Don't waist your time unless all you want a good glass of iced tea."}
{"text":"It is what it is... Cracker Barrel. I've prefer to only eat breakfast here but they have a large menu to accommodate picky individuals. No shortage of crappy duck dynasty merchandise being sold. Occasionally they have a seasonal pot roast that is delicious."}
{"text":"In CA, Cracker Barrel was associated with a block of cheese at the grocer not a restaurant with country cooking. My first tummy luvin encounter with CB was in WI a few yrs ago. Imagine my delight when I spied one in Peoria right off the 101.

Went there for dinner and ordered the sampler, which featured a little bit of everything--chicken & dumplings, a small slice of meatloaf, and a thin piece of ham with 2 sides of your choice. While we waited, we entertained ourselves with the Peg Game to determine whether our college years taught us anything of value. It confirmed that any aspirations to be a professional math-lete or economist at RAND were hopeless. 

The food was delicious and did not disappoint--the chicken & dumplings had white gravy and the ham complimented the greens I ordered.  Unfortunately, the meatloaf seemed a little dry and bland, despite the tomato based sauce on top. As if we didn't have enough food, the meal was also served with cornbread and biscuits.  The sampler was a great way to evaluate options without committing to a single entree.  

After dinner, we socialized outside on the rocking chairs with our east side friends. I engaged in a checkers challenge on the oversized board and soon became painfully aware that the low table was forcing me to mimic the posture of the hunch back of notre dame.  At that point, the quaint little rocking chairs lost their appeal as I strategized my victory.

Overall we had a pleasant time & definitely recommend CB when you're in the mood for comfort food in a family style restaurant."}
{"text":"The review is for our store experience.  My friend and I did a little Christmas shopping at the store as it has an array of unique gifts for secret santa at work or just something different that you can't find at the department stores.  Kelly was a great help and even went to the back area to find certain items we might be interested in.  We had a great time shopping and felt welcome and that Kelly had joined in our shopping fun.  Thanks Kelly...you were awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"This place can be very inconsistent.  Sometimes great sometimes just downright bad. I've has great grilled cheese and then scrambled eggs that were one giant piece served with sausage patties that were so tough you could use them as hockey pucks. 
Tonight on my visit the chicken and dumplings - the dumplings were big flat noodles. The corn bread dry and hard."}
{"text":"Like going home to the south.  Friendly and warm.    Love the staff.  They try so hard.  The food is made with care and food old fashioned fresh ingredients.   Thanks for bringing back fond memories
Even when we found a hair in our plate.   They quickly made sure to replace it with a new healthy serving.   
Love their chicken and dumplings and all their sides"}
{"text":"I love CB. We have visited several in Arizona many times and always 4-5 star-worthy, for sure. Granted this location JUST opened up, it still had some major problems that I don't understand, like the to go orders.

We came for breakfast and were told the wait was 1.5 hours. We put our name down around noon and I shopped till I was about to drop, but then they called our name. Awesome. 

We sit down and order with our waiter, Bob. Bob was great. Food was fair. Most was room temp., and nothing came out nice and hot and fresh. Kid's fries were disgusting and ice cold and not fresh and broken in half. Sent those nasties back. Bob was even appalled. Everything else was ok. 

Bought up half of the baby section of the store, paid the bill and went on our way. 

Several hours later, sent my hubs to pick up a to go order that consisted of meatloaf, a chicken salad and two kids meals and it took him longer for the to go order than it did that morning for us to eat breakfast. Epic fail. So not happy. 

Plus, their merch. prices seem higher than Arizona. They had nothing on sale because they just opened, but I don't remember nearly every single baby outfit being $25 and most of the adult outfits being $40+. I sill bought more than I should have, but I wasn't as happy with the food or prices as I remember being every other time we have went to a CB."}
{"text":"We came here several months ago on our summer vaca to arizona. We enjoyed it. I am a typical tourist but my husband raved about how much I would like it...and I did.

Wait times can be quite long, esp on weekend mornings but there is an awesome gift store with souvenirs and clothes and fun little novelty toys for the kiddos.

Food was great. We ordered a bunch of different things. French toast, biscuits and gravy, eggs and bacon, oatmeal and fresh fruit...I think we tried it all. It was all great. I just wish they had this chain in CA."}
{"text":"Really happy with today's breakfast. Ordered a momma's special (not on the menu): grits (they're delicious), two eggs, small hashbrown, two pancakes and bacon and sausage. Also ordered the French toast-amazing! 4 nice size round pieces. And the pancakes were good. Also got biscuits and gravy-delish. Everything was good. Didn't have time to snap pics of food. We were too hungry! We devoured our meals before I remembered! LoL 

Parking lot was packed but we didn't wait at all to be seated. Service was great. Everything was good. Shopped at the store afterwards and picked up a few things. Wish they had more sales. Kinda pricey. Adorable clothes for women and kids. Something for everyone. My kinda place. Wish they would open one in California."}
{"text":"Quick family stop on our cross country family road trip. Always fun for the kids to play checkers while we wait for our dinner."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual.  We didn't get cornbread with our meal because they ran out. They baked some more and our waitress didn't get any for us begore they were all gone. She brought us some after we had finished our meal snd was ready to leave."}
{"text":"Omg! This place can not give you clean silverware. After four try's we could finally able to use a fork. The food is sub pare. They have gone downhill for sure. The only good thing is the gift shop."}
{"text":"I haven't chosen to go to a Cracker Barrel in years, yet I seem to end up there with family.  We had a party of seven this morning. 

I asked both my kids to remind me what I said I should order the next time I was forced CB - \"pancakes!\"  I did and was completely disappointed.  They came out so cold the margarine warmed THEM up. It took a good 15 minutes to get another order, by which time my eggs were cold.   My daughter and I both asked for crispy bacon to no avail. 

The staff was friendly, which accounts for the extra star from an otherwise one-star review."}
{"text":"i've lived in this area for 10 years and never been to Cracker Barrell. I had a day off and we decided to go out for breakfast. Not that many good options in the area. I let my daughter decide and see loves the shopping area at CB, so that was the pick. This CB is completely typical. Some good shopping for unique items before you go in. The food was good. You can get your homemade biscuit, bacon, eggs, ham, sausage, pancakes, etc. All good southern breakfast options and they are quite tasty. Our waitress was nice and attentive. This isn't the crispy crepe, and not a memorable dining experience, but if you want some good southern breakfast it is a pretty good option."}
{"text":"My family and I had such a nice time. Our server Rowan was fantastic. So funny and polite. The place was very clean and organized. Everything came out in a timely manner. Other than my order being a little too fatty, which is unusual, it was wonderful. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Why are dumpings so thick & doughy?  Why is okra so hard?  I love Cracker Barrel in Tennessee.  Send your cooks there to learn how to cook southern food."}
{"text":"This location is our favorite family dinner spot. It's clean, friendly and quick to serve. All the servers here are amazing and have great welcoming personalities."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel does not question anyone with pets entering the restaurant. Only service animals are allowed in food establishments. Willful neglect of law and customers."}
{"text":"So excited to see that Cracker Barrel is so close to the strip in Vegas.  It's a family favorite while traveling.  We were able to walk right in and get a seat.  We had excellent service, her name is Kathi.  Very friendly, attentive and loves her home state of Ohio.  Make sure to get the cheese potato casrole."}
{"text":"The service was really good.  They have a huge menu but realistically a lot of it is redundant, just different sizes/portions of the same meal.  The food was really good, and they do offer a low carb menu if you want a lighter option.  I love the little country store, too."}
{"text":"Our experience started off bad. The two of us walked in and were seated right away, however, we waited approximately 19 minutes for somebody to even acknowledge us. The family of four who was seated after us had drinks and appetizers already. I would have given less stars of it wasn't for Kelly who saw the frustration on my face and came over to help. She took our order and had the manager come to our table who said sorry. We got our food fast after with was better then ok but not great. When we paid, I believe the cashiers name was Jean, she was very delightful. It was our first time here and probably won't return. I did appreciate that the manager acknowledged the problem and Kelly have good service, I just expected the good service from the time I walked in the door and not only when I complained."}
{"text":"My husband and I used Cracker Barrel's catering service from the Fairlawn, Ohio location for our wedding reception 2 weekends ago. We had around 170 guests, which included about 20 children. We chose to do the campfire meals special that they typically run in the fall (chicken or beef cooked in foil with vegetables and potatoes). We had to let them know how many meals we would need a couple of months in advance so that they would have enough. They also provided bread and biscuits, apple butter, coleslaw, kale salad, sweet and unsweetened tea, and lemonade, as well as mac and cheese, chicken tenders, and carrots for the kids. From what we were told, this was the first time someone ordered campfire meals from them for a wedding reception. We had a barn wedding & reception, so the campfire meals were perfect! SO many people complemented us on the meals as it was delicious and so unique - and the kids loved their food as well! Thomas, the manager of the Fairlawn store, brought the food to our venue (approximately 20 minutes away from the store). He was so kind, helpful, and attentive all night long. His staff was also very friendly and helpful as they assisted in serving guests and cleaning up afterwards. Crystal, a manager of several stores, was the person who helped us set all of this up. She was beyond awesome. She had us come in to taste everything a couple months in advance to see what we thought. She organized the whole thing and stayed in contact with us up until the wedding. Unfortunately she was out of town for our wedding day so we did not see her the day of, but she still checked in to see how everything went. We could not be happier with their catering service and would highly recommend them to anyone for ANY occasion!"}
{"text":"I waited to go here.. till all the hoopla died down about them coming to Vegas..
The staff is very nice.. but service very slow...be prepared to wait for someone to greet your table.. 
The food is like old style Comfort Food you find in the Lancaster. Pa area.. 
The food is good.. I wish it was served hot..it is has been lukewarm ..I have dined here twice & have been served lukewarm soup and my Entree was lukewarm..
The portion size and what they offer good and so is the price..
Paying your bill when you want to leave is terrible. You wait in this long line with people purchasing from the gift shop.. it took 15 minutes to pay your food check..
Need to improve on that..you wait to be seated and then wait to pay your bill.."}
{"text":"100% Cracker Barrel Crack Addict!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in their lack of service. Food isn't great anymore. Skipped my name. Didn't refill my coffee. Coffee taste burnt . Didn't bring out the bread and jam. I just sat here hungry. When the food arrived the eggs were burnt!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of the Cracker.  My only gripe with all the stores (this one is no exception) is the wait time.  Sure they have plenty of distractions (the store front with merchandise, rocking chairs, and checkers outside) but there is almost always a 30min wait.  Maybe I'm just unlucky during the times I am hoping to get some French toast or some country cookin'.

This location is fairly new, it's kept well and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Any place that serves breakfast all day has a special reserved area of my heart.  This Cracker Barrel is nothing too special to report about but it does serve a nice function for taking people early to the airport (when living on the other side of town).

I've eaten here a couple of times, either waiting for people on delayed flights or getting some food in before dropping them off.  Most of my experiences here are good.  The service is very good about getting food in a hurry to you if you are in a rush (to catch a flight).

Standard \"General Store\" theme in the front of the store is always stocked with novelty items that you can wander around in to ease the wait times, but the times I have gone here have not had more than a 5min wait.

Servers are pretty nice and the food has been consistent.  Last visit was missing tees from the brain-teaser game on the table that is fun to do to pass the time.  Needless-to-say we weren't teasing our brains much that day."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel is our go to place to eat with our family of five small children so with this being our first visit here at this restaurant, we were very, very disappointed with the lack of quality food and service, especially on a non-busy Wednesday evening. Usually, Cracker Barrel is consistently good whether we've eaten in other restaurants around the Charlotte area, Texas, Louisiana, or Virginia. 

We had to ask for biscuits after the food arrived because our waitress left and never brought them. My order of fries that came as a side for my meal didn't arrive until we were already done eating.

The Mac and cheese for the kids did not look like what we normally got. Usually it's nice, yellow, cheesy, homemade looking, hearty portion that even my 7 year old cannot typically finish. They both got a small serving of a half cup or so that was about the amount of my side order of Mac and cheese and she finished it before we got biscuits.

My husband's roast beef was disappointing and not worth the $11. Is the portion normally a small portion the size of a deck of cards? All the online pictures I've looked at and the other yelp pictures of the roast beef had servings that were twice the amount of the little portion he got. Even my two trout fillets were well worth the value. And it's not like he got steak. 

I did speak to the manager who commented that the roast beef should've been a five ounce portion. 

I do love you Cracker Barrel, just not this one. I wish I took pictures. I was just disappointed. And I'll definitely just order something else I wouldn't make at home."}
{"text":"The food was decent. The servers and waitstaff were very friendly to my service dog and I. Just as we were gathering to leave, our food and drinks in to to go containers, the manager plows around the counter: brusquely demanding, \"Is that a service dog?\"  
I politely replied, \"yes.\"
He bellowed, \"Well, is it a he or she; it needs to be under the table.\"
I responded, \"We're actually just leaving, she laid to the right of me out of the walkway.  She doesn't fit under table because of her size, and the rungs under the table.\"
He pointed, commanding: \"Next time, under the table.\"
I apologized, \"I'm sorry, none of the servers asked us to move.\"


A lady next to us said, \"Leave them alone, they're fine.\"

During our meal, the waitstaff complimented my dog's courteous behavior and training."}
{"text":"Food was okay, nothing special. Biscuits and gravy are really bad though. It was like eating wet cement that got stuck in my throat. Had to drink hot coffee to push it down. The grits were really good, and so were the eggs. My kid greatly enjoyed his pancake, and I thought the mini syrup bottles were cute. The store is where we had the most fun. It's not really designed to be wheelchair accessible, but we managed to get around without breaking anything. I picked up a fun mug that was bigger than my head and a couple of toy guns for my son. Waiter and store clerks were very nice. I'd go back for the fun of it, I'd just pass on the biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"I have been curious to try this place because I remember it from Growing up in Texas. We came here early on a Sunday (no wait) and were immediately seated. We sat for about 4-5 minutes when finally we were greeted. Not only did the waitress (Jennifer g) push for drink order, but also food order. It felt so rushed. My husband stumbled through the menu and ordered without really knowing what he wanted. We waited about ten minutes and the food came out very fast. We didn't see the server that entire time. When the food was dropped, Jennifer came back and gave us our check! She didn't check on how the food was, she didn't ask if we needed refills, just the check. We felt so pushed out, it was ridiculous. The food itself is ok. The portions are ridiculously large, but it really wasn't that great. The breakfast eat all tastes previously frozen. The one saving grace is the hash brown casserole, which is the only reason this review is two stars than one star.  After eating, we did a quick scan of the table, made sure the kids had everything, and left.  We paid with the cashier and walked to the car. At that point it had been maybe three minutes. We realized my son had forgotten his favorite hotwheels car and my husband went inside to retrieve it.  There was already a new couple at the table and he asked the hostess if the busboy had found it.  Nope, they had thrown it away.  I get it, my son shouldn't have left it, but the carelessness and lack of empathy from the staff was appalling.  The whole experience felt very \"get them in and get them out.\"  I personally will not go again.  I would urge others to think twice before going."}
{"text":"Love the food and the service have been going to Cacker Barrles for years and every time I go it is just like I'm going for the first time it is so nice."}
{"text":"So I will start off by saying a 2 is a generous rating.  I don't leave very many reviews but felt I needed to today.  The temperature in this restaurant is so cold you should bring a jacket and gloves to eat.  It took 45 min to get our food, where half of it was cold.  Mind you there were only about 6 tables full.  Then the best part, we were alloted a whole 7 min (that's right I timed it) before we were asked if we were finished and given the check.  This single reason is why I felt inclined to write such a negative review.

To write a positive note the waiter was pleasant and some of the food was good (catfish, baked apples, and cheese grits)."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast ever! Everything was overcooked and dry! Coffee was watery. Grits were soupy. I've never had a bad breakfast at Cracker Barrel, but this location needs some TLC."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for a day and found there was a Cracker Barrel, i live in california only other place is back east. they have Great tasting breakfast, had momma 's pancake breakfast. crispy and buttery pancakes with there maple syrup also the bacon  crispy and thick with two over medium eggs the way I like them unlike some places that fry them to there death."}
{"text":"Our last visit to a Cracker Barrel was back in December in Albuquerque, NM and it was AWFUL.  But we are in Buckeye where the choices are limited so we decided, why not.

First, it's Cracker Barrel, it is what it is.  Comfort food, I usually get breakfast whenever we go and am a happy girl.  This time I had the fried catfish and it was excellent.  My husband had the chicken & dumplings and said his could have been a little hotter but honestly that is the only small issue we had and it wasn't enough for us to ask the waitress, who was very attentive, to heat it up or get something hotter.

We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waitress was one of the best we have ever had.  The place was clean and everyone was friendly.  Our food was good and we left happy and will return."}
{"text":"upon entering the establishment, I was pleasantly surprised by the \"mom and pop\" feeling emitted by the gift shop. I was almost immediately seated by the host. the lack of booths in the location are most definitely a negative drawback. the atmosphere on the main floor is an interesting one, lots of old knick knacks covering the wall. food arrived relatively quick, and the wait staff was relatively friendly. the quality of the food was fresh, and tastefully sound. however, the lack of booths prevents this location from earning 5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for dumplings and they're out.  How does a restaurant that touts dumplings as their signature item sell out on a Wednesday? The waitress really had nothing to say when I kind of was angered by it. She just stared at me as if saying, \"well...what do you want now?\" I wasn't too pleased by the whole situation.

Besides that, she only came round to give us the food and then give us the bill. We had to order something else and ask for the check from other waitresses. 

This place didn't leave a good impression. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Our waitress Debra was very sweet and chatty in an appropriate way after assessing we were interested in conversation. The food and cleanliness were typical Cracker Barrel, reliable and safe."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to see what all the hype was about.

It was a minimum 1 hour 20 minutes wait which is understandable since it just opened. They had rocking chairs available for customers in waiting to sit on or buy. Their store is nice, I like what they had in there and it's a good idea because it kills time.

Girlfriend and I both had the chicken dumpling with the aide of fries and okra. Sadly to say everything was bland. The corn bread was hard and dry...my daughter wasn't impressed my her shrimp and dumplings either and my 1 year old was hitting the dining table with her corn bread. Oh my.

It was a let down but maybe it was the cook. I'll it try again next time with my husband, he's from the East Coast and my critic of this place pissed him off."}
{"text":"This is the worst Cracker Barrel in the chain the service is awful and the food sucks.  I have eaten there 3 times and today was the last the food was cold my order was all wrong.  They give you biscuits with no plate?  I asked for a plate and the waitress told me flat out they dont give them they are short on plates?   No need to go back to this place.."}
{"text":"Walked in the first time and was confused because it was like a gift store.  They sell different kinds of candies, similar to a mom and pop store.  You have to walk pass the store to get into the restaurant.  The biscuit and gravy was okay.  The pancake was really good and the maple syrup came in small bottles and it was still warm.  Prices were decent and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"We love the Cracker Barrel. You just can't go wrong stopping here for a delicious homemade meal. The ambiance is wonderful and the shopping is extremely fun before or after your meal. The food is excellent. I have loved stopping at any Cracker Barrel along our travels. I would recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"So the gift shop is always amazing i love it. The food is okay. Nothing great. But service is good."}
{"text":"If you want consistently good service and food then Cracker Barrel is the place to be! I changed up my order this time and got the Mama's Pancakes and it was delicious. I recommend ordering biscuits and apple butter."}
{"text":"It's ok for Cracker Barrel. The service is timely food is standard to the chain. Location is nice"}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice in the past few weeks, and both times were quite pleasant experiences. 

The first was a visit with a coworker. This Cracker Barrel is very close to work, so it was an easy option to try out. We were both pleased with our meals, and the amount of food. You get surprisingly large meals for surprisingly small fare. I ordered breakfast - I don't think I have ever ordered anything other than breakfast at a Cracker Barrel. It was delicious. She ordered a burger and she said it was very good. 

We came back a week or so later with a larger work group. We were seated quickly and even though our group was larger, the food still did not take all that long to come out and everything was great! 

The gift shop is always fun to peruse as well. They have a selection of foods and candy that you just can't find anywhere else. Herr's brand sweet corn flavored popcorn, and Herr's brand grilled cheese and tomato soup cheese curls. These items alone are worth the trip. TRY THEM next time you stop in here."}
{"text":"Super fast and friendly service! I always love my experience at Cracker Barrel. Nothing fancy, but yummy comfort food at a great price. Always reminds me of road tripping with the fam as I browse through the adorable country store. You can't be in a bad mood at Cracker Barrel!"}
{"text":"The wait was long, service slow, and the food was not how I remembered it from the Cracker Barrel in Arkansas.  My husband got food poisoning from the gravy.  The kids' breakfast meals do not come with a drink and, when ordering, the waitress asked each child if they wanted bacon or sausage making it seem like part of the meal.  When we got the check all sides were an \"add-on\" and charged extra.  The only thing I like about this place is the store, that's it!"}
{"text":"This place is great and not to mention excellent customer service. My waitress Renata was attentive and on her game. Food was hot, fresh and a pleasure to eat. I will definitely be back to this location next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Cracker Barrel! I always wished i liked you! I would! Except the food is always lukewarm. Lukewarm to the point where it's like... Has this been sitting in a vat at a low temp? Is it safe? Chicken and dumplings, soup, hash brown casserole, eggs, grits gravy... These are items that come out lukewarm for me. (One time I had for lunch a super delicious breaded catfish and shrimp with remoulade sauce that was on special. Amazing! But... It was a special and never seen again.)  the prices are somewhat high. There is a huge breakfast menu which is good but it's too much food lukewarm and then you go into a food coma. 

But if you haven't been.... You should go because it is cute, and the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Servers friendly OK service food horrible taste bland worse than retirement home food first time going here and will be the last nasty sausage patty cold and The biscuits and gravy dry biscuits and tasteless gravy"}
{"text":"Good authentic southern food. I love having breakfast, lunch and dinner here."}
{"text":"Been here for 20in no food the table next to has not clean discussing   Hard to believe they cannot clean and this place is not busy"}
{"text":"They made my breakfast and they didn't screw it up...except for the toast.

Big improvement over CBs in Texas (or have I set the bar too low?)"}
{"text":"I like the food here... it's simple homestyle comfort food. Will go back again to try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"This review is to describe the service I received during my last two visits. I've been to this place several times but lately it hasn't been a nice experience lately. 
I brought my sister here for breakfast because she loves pancakes and I have to admit that Cracker Barrel does have some pretty amazing pancakes. Anyway, our waitress  took our order incorrectly and then she ended up charging us for the wrong order. Our breakfast wasn't that good either. (Except for the pancakes)
The last time I visited was in the end of October. I decided to place an online order and I ordered an order of pumpkin spice pancakes and regular pancakes for my husband. When I got there I waited 40 minutes to get my order. 40 minutes! 
Then a gentleman came out with my order and told me that they only made regular pancakes because they didn't sell pumpkin spice pancakes. What?!
He said there was no phone number on the order which is a lie because when I placed my order it only allowed me to process the order once the phone number was typed in. The difference was only 70cents but the point is that I waited 40 minutes for something I didn't order. They didn't even bother to tell me when I paid for my order at the cash register. 
I don't think I'll be visiting this location after two bad experiences."}
{"text":"I used to go to Cracker Barrel in Florida all the time and got excited when I saw this restaurant in Las Vegas close to Silverton Casino. We decided to give it a try. The food was great, portions are huge. I got a big fried chicken salad and my boyfriend got chicken pot pie which was a special on that day. Everything was delicious. 
The service was very good and pretty fast even though the place was very busy. Our server Jordan and the older lady who seated us were super friendly and accommodating. The manager was going from table to table making sure that everybody's food was good and everybody was having a good time. And the prices? How can you beat them!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't find anything wrong with this place. It was newly opened but everything went so smooth. The place is super crowded when we left, others even waiting outside to be seated. We came early, there's (4) of us and we were seated within 15 minutes. Very friendly staffs, fast service, food was amazing... Specially the pancakes and syrup! The manager came out and ask how our day was and how's the food. We will definitely come back! The only thing is it's TOO FAR from me hahaha .. I wish we had this on Northwest side of town."}
{"text":"Typically the food at this restaurant is always good. At this location specifically which I've been to twice, the food just isn't up to par. Which someone also left a review and I agree with. The waitresses aren't very friendly. I have good allergies and they weren't very pleased to know that. I was in AZ and at the other restaurant there and they were so nice. They  even had the manager come out and confirm that food was actually cooked separately in an effort to avoid cross contamination which is such a nice thing. I've been to many many ridiculously expensive restaurants and never has that happened so point for the other location. Word of advice for this location, be considerate, many people have food allergies and still want to enjoy restaurants, kids love this place and many kids have food allergies, show a little bit of compassion."}
{"text":"A bustling open floor plan with many patrons to break their fast with Cracker Barrel's breakfast menu. Staff super pleasant and on top of their work. Ordered the Sunrise Sampler to get a taste of what this place was offering. It came with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, grits, biscuit with gravy and a slice of orange. I got nothing poor to say about the speedy service, western themed atmosphere or easy checkout. I would come back just for their sausage patties."}
{"text":"Sticky tables. Food on the floor from previous customer. Incorrect food came out. We ate some and waited until we were done for the rest to be brought out to us. We WERE big fans of this chain, but we had a horrible experience and there's so much competition, we will NOT return."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a quick home made style meal for a good price.  I love the green chille chicken grill. They have a lot of good options including a healthy/light menu. 

I also like to explore and get lost on the gift shop they always have very nice things,  oh and the rocking chairs ?? Funnn..."}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping my husband and I were starving. Hadn't been to a Cracker Barrel in years and my husband said, \"oh, biscuits and gravy!\"

No wait on a Saturday afternoon should have been a indication how our dining experience was going to end up.

He ordered his biscuits with sausage and 1 scrambled egg. After much thought I decided that I wasn't really that hungry and just ordered a side of Lima beans. 

So, food arrived very quickly and most likely because my husband's was leftover from breakfast. His biscuits hard, country gravy was thicker than wallpaper paste and it had a funky rancid bacon grease taste. Egg wasn't really scramble, was like it was put on the flat top the yolk broke then flipped. My limas on the other hand were spectacular. Studded with small bits of bacon, the beans soft but not mushy.

The waitress was nice and she refilled our tea several times. 

One star for her, one star for the Lima beans.

We probably won't be back to Cracker Barrel, we will visit Waffle House instead."}
{"text":"I have visited lots of Cracker Barrel restaurants across the USA. We traveled from CA to FL and hit every Cracker Barrel along the way and have usually had great food and service. I visited this restaurant today and left while placing my order. Our server told us we could not get just biscuits, he had never heard of this before, they have to come with a meal. Then the first person orders and they want a burger with extra fries and no coleslaw. We are told I'm not sure we can do that. Correct me if I'm wrong but we are the consumer and while we might have to pay for these extra items we should have the ability to get things like extra fries and biscuits if you would like them. Telling a consumer no to regular menus items is not okay. Thanks to Keenan, our server, I will not return to this Cracker Barrel. There's a reason your parking lot is not very full at dinner time."}
{"text":"When most white people go to eat dimsum at a Chinese restaurant, they are usually clueless and have no idea what anything is and what to order.  I am Asian, and this is how I felt my first time at Cracker Barrel.  Note to self: chicken and dumplings does NOT equal chicken dumplings.

Although I had a great time here because of the fun decor, games at the table, and the overall \"whiteness\" of the place, I found the food to be really heavy.  I left feeling like the food I had just eaten would sit in my colon for days.  I would come back, just not too often."}
{"text":"Waiter very forgetful. Forgot the type of our drinks twice. Then when ordering he was rushing us. Next. Next. Next. kept saying. And we were not done ordering. Very rude. Very busy place. Everyone keeps talking highly of this place. Not as expected. Not recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Typically I like this chain of restaurants and are always consistent in the food quality. The quality of food is mediocre to keep the costs low. The service was not so good on this occasion. My friend ordered a cup of soup with the meal but it didn't show up until after he was done with his main course. Sadly, it was noticed just after the entree was delivered and wasn't delivered to a lot later. The excuse given was \"I ordered it and don't know what happened\". She should have just gone and immediately get it herself."}
{"text":"We eat here occasionally with friends and family. 
This place as with all Cracker Barrels are pretty much the same. I guess that is why there is usually a crowd especially on holiday. 
Their food is consistent. If you want to substitute an item on the menu for something else you may not be able to. After you eat or while you are waiting to be seated there is the store with a bunch of stuff your wife will want to look at. 
They do take reservations but if it is a holiday be prepared to still wait an hour to be seated. This is what happened the last time we went there."}
{"text":"Staff always get a 5 Star but food I'm not a fan of anymore. I remember it being very scratch tasting. Now it seems very processed.  I've given it four recent attempts all to be disappointed. :-("}
{"text":"I've been to Cracker Barrels all over the country.  They're not THE BEST, but they're consistent.  I know the menu.  I know the service.  I know the store.  

The last visit I ordered the fried shrimp and I was pleasantly surprised.  This did not seem like the regular fried shrimp you get anywhere else.  It was seasoned and pretty delicious.  It also came with three hushpuppies.  I don't usually like hushpuppies, but these were good.  Did I mention yet that I also got three sides?  Whoa!  Lots of food.

I have to admit, though, that CB is not my favorite place to go.  I don't want to know about the calorie or fat intake here.  But DD loves getting a single pancake with fried apples on top... and I don't blame her.  

I know a lot of people don't like their biscuits, but they are one of my favorite parts of eating here.  Just a half biscuit (or three) with a little blackberry jam could make me completely satisfied for days.  Okay, I exaggerate.  But I love their biscuits.  Please don't tell me how fattening they are.  I don't care!

The only thing I don't understand is: why aren't there omelets on the breakfast menu?!

P.S. The turkey sausage is quite good.  I don't eat pork, so maybe I am not the best judge, but even DH likes their turkey sausage."}
{"text":"Always good. Consistent quality of food and service! The Uncle Hershel's breakfast is my favorite. The grits cool down quick so you should probably eat those first!"}
{"text":"Best catfish in town. Good country style restaurant and decent service. I'll be back and back and back."}
{"text":"Great home style food. Lots of side options. The sweet tea is a must have. They have fried okra which is delicious. Our waitress was cheerful and very attentive.  The manager greeted us at our table. Great staff.
The store has wonderful items to choose from and the pricing is very reasonable"}
{"text":"First time ever at a Cracker Barrel and loved it. Between four of us we had breakfast and dinner meals. The customer service was great and the food was good too."}
{"text":"I enjoy their home style cooking foods (even though their high cholesterol and not really healthy), but I completely disagree with their stance on gay rights. They're homophobic and have a huge sign when you go in that they support family values, etc.... but gay rights is clearly missing. Now, believe me, when I go there I go for the food. I have friends I'd be embarrassed to tell I have been there recently. My 8 year old was with her mother for Thanksgiving this year so I wanted to take her to brunch before I had to drop her off. Cracker Barrel was one of the only tasty places open. Wow, Thanksgiving morning at Cracker Barrel is a beast. They have this turkey deal that all the people wanted, but we just wanted breakfast. We waited an hour for a table and the Smokehouse Breakfast could've been smokier."}
{"text":"Service was very slow today, food took forever and our server forgot to bring what we requested. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Lunch 1-2pm
Very clean, but getting harder to get to restaurant due to all the merchandise for sale.
Hostess greeted me immediately.
Very slow service today, took over 8 minutes for a server to come to the table (after 3 had previously walked by, I know you see me sitting here).  No apologies offered, stale face, took order.  Drink delivery was over my shoulder.  Food delivery:  dropped on table, person too busy trying to get customers in her section to focus on me.  Never asked if order was correct, need anything else.  Food:  was hot and good.  Oh here is my server, drink poured and left, no questions asked.  Did my server go above and beyond today? NO. ( and you know what that mean)
FYI, new menus mean higher prices on some selections!"}
{"text":"I moved here from Orange County in Southern California about 4 years ago, we don't have these restaurants back home. It took me 4-5 months before I realized that Cracker Barrel had a restaurant, from the outside it just looks like a retail store of country themed items and gifts. 

   The customer service at this store has always been good every time I've eaten here. The portions are good sized and I do find country/southern food items (catfish, okra etc.) on the menu that I do not see in other restaurants.  I wish they'd get Fried Green Tomatoes on the menu."}
{"text":"Love this little place! So much food for so little money lol my husband and I eat good meals and our tab is never more than $30 for both. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"Raw chicken, uncooked pancakes & a side of disrespect

This is a review of the management, not so much of the overall restaurant. 

My family visited the restaurant on Christmas Eve. The chicken on my wife's salad was raw in the middle - completely pink. The pancakes we ordered for the kids were also not cooked in the middle. When we let the manager know, he acted as though it was an imposition. And his solution? He offered to take the raw chicken dinner and the uncooked pancakes off our bill. (Duh!). He did not apologize or offer not to charge us for the replacement salad that my wife did not touch since she felt so ill after biting into the raw chicken. The manager was completely dismissive of our concerns, did not apologize, and offered an insufficient remedy to the situation. 

I suspect that he did not have any training whatsoever regarding how to address situations such as these. Which is surprising, since when we first raised the issues with our waitress, she also did not seem surprised, did not apologize, and simply said: \"Would you like something else?\". Thus, it seems like the kitchen issues must not be a surprise. 

This concern is not so much about the kitchen staff. Mistakes happen, and I realize that they were rushing to close early on the holiday. But, the manager's response was terrible, and seems to be a sign of bad overall management."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with a few friends that were visiting from Oklahoma. Food was good, service was good, though we did have to wait a little while for drink refills a few times (not a horrible thing). Dinner was not overpriced."}
{"text":"So glad there's one closer to LA now. Always crave the food from here. Great service! Seated in the best timely manner for their opening day. No complaints. Friendly staff. Can't wait to come back before I go back home!"}
{"text":"The wife my son and his girlfriend were in Vegas on vacation and decided to check this place out, I'm glad we did...."}
