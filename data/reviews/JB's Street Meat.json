{"text":"As usual some amazing food at JB's, but today we tried there ice cream!!! Yummy!!! I definitely recommend to satisfy your sweet tooth it was delicious."}
{"text":"It's normally irrelevant to consider the previous business which occupied the space, but you can't help but remember RD's which used to be at this location, not just for it's legacy, but the fact that JB's also serves up similar BBQ fare. With that said, it's not a case of comparing which is better or worse, and JB's is doing more than enough to be reviewed on its own merits.

The place has undergone renovations. What had previously been a bit cramped and dive-y, is now more open for the sake of being a bit utilitarian to make way for a larger kitchen/prep area. Be aware that it now means there's it's not intended for group seating, as there's about 6  bar-style seats. It's suitable for a place to come in for a quick bite, or for takeout...and they deliver with Uber Eats.

Regarding the food, it would be best described as a BBQ place, since it has pulled chicken, pulled pork, ribs, wings and a few other things. Purists will notice that it doesn't have all the things you'd expect to find at a BBQ joint (like beef brisket) BUT they also offer everyday comfort fare such as: hamburgers, hot dogs (including foot longs), grilled cheese and even corn dogs.

At this point, I've come in for their quarter chicken dinner, their Big Bird sandwich (pulled chicken, LOTS of bacon, bbq sauce, cheese, lettuce and tomato), and well as their full chicken takeout dinner. As I'm writing this, I realize that I should probably try some of the non-poultry items, but each item has been stellar. The chicken is smoked and they've done it wonderfully by having it nicely seasoned, the right balance of smoke and very tender. The whole chicken I brought home was a huge hit. The family pack at $30 is great value since it includes: the chicken, coleslaw, fries, gravy, and biscuits.

Everything is super fresh and made to order. You'll notice that there isn't one aspect that they sort've just dial in, as they ensure even the bread is great quality, the fries are fresh-cut and all other details are given attention.

They also do Saturday brunch, which includes sweet and savoury crepes, chicken 'n waffles and a sausage biscuit sandwich. I've tried the chicken n' waffles as well as the breakfast sandwich. Both come with a heaping amount of home fries. The sandwich was MASSIVE and delicious. The fried chicken was prepared from scratch and went great with the waffle and syrup which had some chilli in it (regular syrup available too).

There's more to explore for sure, but I've tried enough to know that they do everything right, make everything fresh and at terrific value too. Glad to have such a gem back in this place."}
{"text":"JB's has been rated in the top 5 restaurants in Brampton almost every month.  Its kind of out of my way from where I live to go there but had always wanted to try it.  Reviews look great and pictures look even better.  I recently downloaded the Skip the Dishes app and low and behold JB's was on there.  I was very excited.  I placed an order on the app.  The order came quicker than stated on the app.  I ordered the whole hog ultimate sandwich.  This sandwich should be every mans dream sandwich.  Once it arrived i opened the container and it looked MASSIVE and could not wait ti sink my teeth into it.  The bottom of the bun was so soggy that it fell apart as soon and i touched it.  I was forced to eat my sandwich with a fork and knife.  I did not like the bbq sauce, I had a taste of  onions even though I had asked for no onions, the sausage patty was more like a hamburger.  The pulled pork was a bit fatty.  The bacon was amazing.  Fries were off the hook.  Now this was my first time eating here.  Did I order the right thing?  Maybe.  Was the lack of taste and soggy bread because of the delivery? Possibly.  For now my review stands at 2 stars but I will not cancel out giving JB's a second chance.  So stay tuned for a possible update."}
{"text":"JB's is my new favourite poutine spot in Brampton! Lovely family-run restaurant. Portion sizes are very large and everything I've tried so far here has been wonderful. 
Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Food is so good.
Chicken dinner is amazing, biscuits are great as is the coleslaw. Fries are ok, but we generally get the Mac and cheese and toss the fries, will see if we can pay a bit extra to substitute it next time or just omit it all together. I always feel bad wasting food. Pulled pork is flavorful as is the wings and ribs. Great go to for BBQ. We will return."}
{"text":"So, this is a tiny little restaurant that only seats 6-8 ppl. Most of all the biz is take-out. 

The food that I had was not good. I ordered an off-menu item based on the word of another patron. It was the Cajun Burger that came with fries. The salt count for the burger was off the scale!! There was so much salt, it burned my tongue. I asked for the fries to be crispy...they weren't. They even had an off brand ketchup!! It wasn't good.

I ordered a biscuit as well & it was hard. They ONLY redeeming part was the Mac & Cheese. It was good but not great as stated. 

With the exception of the M&C I threw most of it away. :( This is NOT a do-over for me & I won't go again."}
{"text":"Great little spot for gourmet burgers. Everything's homemade and the place is very clean! Very cool people running it too, I highly recommend it if you're in the Queen/Kennedy area of Brampton!"}
