{"text":"Good coffee, clean and friendly. Fast service and pretty good food for a traditional \"greasy spoon\" breakfast place. I had the Protein Power, scrambled egg whites with bacon and sausage. $6.99.  Served in under 5 minutes. Much better than the place next door."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the Tuesday stuffed cabbage lunch special. Waiter was friendly, food was on time, and tasted good. Seems like a nice little diner to get a home cooked style meal at a decent price."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here.  I usually get breakfast once a week or so - mainly the omelet, but I have tried other items.  Overall pretty tasty.  The only so-so item that I tried so far is the smoothie (blech).  They also have mochas and cappuchino's, etc on the menu but never have it in the diner.  But despite that, I would still recommend the food here!"}
{"text":"This a great little neighborhood diner. A clean, cozy and friendly atmosphere makes it a pleasant dining experience. The food is fresh and flavorful. The specials are great, even though the regular menu is, as another reviewer said, somewhat limited. The servers are all very courteous and friendly. It's just a nice little \"down home\" place to grab a bite with family and friends."}
{"text":"Food is good and inexpensive for a downtown location. Service is slow because they need more than two waitresses serving and cashing out people. They make a lot of takeout orders which takes up more of their time. Drama between workers can be overheard, making things even slower.  Took 20 min from ordering to being served food, which was tasted good.
With better management could be a lot better."}
{"text":"A friendly bunch in this diner-style restaurant served me a great lunch: a grilled tomato & cheese sandwich with homemade chips which were absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. It's going to be my regular stop while waiting for my Megabus connexion, a mere 2 minutes walk away."}
{"text":"I'm in downtown Pittsburgh for the weekend and looking for Sunday Morning breakfast. There is not a lot of options near us but Yelp has pointed us to a nearby cafe...that was closed. Just a few doors down, Hanlon's Cafe was open and doing a brisk business. As we entered, there were a few tables open, but all of them had piles of dirty dishes on them. No worries, someone would surely be by soon to clear the table! We probably waited 5-6 minutes before someone took the dishes away. Additionally, the waitress who took the dishes away asked if they were our dishes. Several other tables were seated and their orders were promptly taken. Then someone bothered to give us menus and take a drink order. 

Fast forward 30 minutes later and no one in our area has received their food - including the people who ordered ahead of us. Finally a waitress shows up with plates of food. Sadly not our food. Upon conferring with another waitress they announce that no one bothered to put the table number on the order tickets. Another waitress stops by with another few plates, also not our food. She stops back by and asks what we ordered. One could say she took our order again.  About 10 minutes later, she arrives with paper plates filled with what we almost ordered. And we still got our food before the other people who ordered before us.

So we ate. I had 2 eggs, sausage, hash browns, and pancakes. [I was hungry.] My friend has two eggs toast and home fries. The food was just plain bad. The \"hash browns\" were from the frozen food section and deep fried. The eggs and pancakes were cold. That sausage was low quality links. My friend's food was slightly better, but not much. 

As we were paying our bill at the counter, someone sent their food back because it was cold and bad. The person in front of me said their party didn't receive part of their order. 

To add insult to injury, the place was filthy. The people clearing dishes spilled food and liquids everywhere. The seating area should be power washed. And my favorite, along one of the diagonal rafters was a rat poison station. It was unclear to us how rats could get up there but that's where the bait station was.

Next time I'm looking for Sunday breakfast in downtown Pittsburgh, I will not be anywhere near Hanlon;s."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I'm from out of town and decided to try something local. Server yells at us as we walk in that she doesn't have room for us and doesn't have the time to clean off a table for us. Finally a different server gets us a spot. Waited 15 to get a drink order and another 10 to get drinks and place food order food took 40 minutes to get. Trying to pay they clumped myself we with 3 other different people. Then got rude when we tried to explain what happened and yelled at us. Don't eat here"}
{"text":"So nice to have a traditional diner Downtown! The staff was super friendly although they were very busy. My low-carb eggs, bacon, and veggies did the job! Great little joint to get breakfast without having to go into the Strip District  on a Sunday!"}
{"text":"Everything  I get. Is. Good.   Here. Not fancy. But. A. Very  good. Clean. Family  owned  business.  And. The. Meat lovers  omlette  home  fries. Good."}
{"text":"When they brought my coffee to my table in a styrofoam I thought it was a little strange but when my food came on a paper plate I was a little mad. Other than that the food was ok. Service wasn't too fast but was friendly and prices cheap."}
{"text":"The newspaper review posted at the entrance says that sometimes a diner is just a diner, and that seems to be what Hanlon's aspires to, but not a very good one.  

Went for Sunday breakfast on a recent trip with the family, and found that most of the food lacked flavor.  The sausage breakfast burrito lacked any punch, the home fries were soggy and bland.  Even my 8 year old said the raisin French toast lacked flavor.

On the plus side, the prices were extremely reasonable.  Breakfast for 4 under $20."}
{"text":"Came in and sat at the counter hoping for a nice quick breakfast. After 45 minutes we still had no food and the place was less than half full. Even after the food came it was missing parts. Not the way I was hoping to start the day."}
{"text":"Good foot, cheap prices, excellent service. I came here when it wasn't crowded, so that would influence things."}
{"text":"I had the special at the servers suggestion.  It was a chicken with stuffing, mashed potatoes, and fresh vegetables.  The veggies were not fresh, the patatoes were undercooked and the chicken dry."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out because the bellman said it was quick and easy as well as its my buddy's last name. Haha. 

Service was non existent. Wasn't able to get refill on my Luke warm coffee or notify them my homefries were cold. 

The cheap price coupled with my egg white Greek omelet being good, saved the day!"}
{"text":"Definitely a greasy spoon. Service is friendly, but somewhat confused. Not sure if they have this, don't have that, don't know what to charge for this.

The sandwich I had was good, the bread was fresh, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Just ok.  I think this place might do better with breakfast fare -- caught a glimpse of a breakfast plate going out (at lunch time) that looked good.

With as many choices as we have in this area, I just don't think there's a compelling reason to go back.

They were busy enough at lunch time...."}
{"text":"Very greasy and unorganized. Food was terrible, especially the deep fried hash browns... the oil tasted days old... will not return."}
{"text":"Wonderful fresh Pittsburgh salad with fries and egg included... Served with three salad dressings by a friendly waitress. I appreciate it even more since I had just up and left the local Pramanti's... Tired of Waiting forever for a waitress to come back and take my order."}
{"text":"The food is pretty great diner food.  However, the last time I was here the waitress whistled along to the song \"Pumped up Kicks\".  I now hope it gets struck by a meteorite."}
{"text":"I love this place. I like a place where you can get breakfast all day. Service and food are good and quick. Popular with the locals for breakfast and lunch. I always stop in when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ordered a side of sausage links and the waitress told me there were five served with each order.  Only four were on the plate when it arrived.  I asked why and was told that the other waitress who took the order was wrong.  They're Jones sausages-small that is.  Bring me another stupid sausage otherwise I leave disappointed.  I should have sung 'more Parks sausages mom, please' although it didn't seem at the time that it would have helped.

Where's the beef?  It's in the rating."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Clean and friendly wait staff. I always enjoy the omelettes personally, though you can't go wrong with their pancakes."}
{"text":"Great diner food! I recommend the hanlons handful for breakfast! Great price and right amount of food."}
{"text":"I go to this place every now and then for breakfast. They have just about all of the traditional breakfast options. Nothing fancy at all. You get fast service at an affordable price. I usually get eggs, and I've never had any complaints with the meal. Only negative is that the ventilation isn't very good, so you sort of smell like a frier after your meal. But still a good value for downtown."}
{"text":"The concierge at our hotel recommended this place for a midday brunch. Overall it looks like your average diner with a grill and fryers behind the bar seating area. It wasn't the cleanest, but the tabletops, plates, silverware, etc were all perfectly acceptable. 

The food ended up being delicious. I had a western omelet with egg whites, rye toast, and home fries. Everything was perfect, and actually was a bit too much for me to finish. My girlfriend had the handful, with hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, sausage links, and pancakes. She enjoyed everything she had as well. 

The only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars was the so-so service. It took nearly 30 minutes for us to get our food (granted it was a little bit busy, but their cooking space is a little small) and it was hard to get any server's attention for drink refills or condiments. 

I would definitely return here for a nice breakfast if I'm ever back in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this breakfast place and loved it. The service was fast and great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Hanlon's Cafe is another hidden gem that my boyfriend and I found on Yelp on a Sunday morning after the St. Patrick's Day parade (A large breakfast was NEEDED) The Crafton location is probably less than a mile from our house and if I'm being honest with you, I've never even noticed it!

We got there at around 10 on a Sunday morning and it was almost full, but not completely packed & we were able to be seated right away. Looking around, it was kind of out dated but in a cute & old fashioned type of way. It seemed like a lot of the other customers were regulars and knew the employees. In fact, one couple told us that they come to Hanlon's every single day! 

When we were seated we were greeted by our waiter almost immediately. It didn't take us long to decide what we wanted to eat either because both Chris and I were starving! We both ended up getting \"The Handful\" 2 eggs over easy, bacon, hash browns, and a side of French toast (they have other options to order it this is how I did) Chris also ordered a side of corned beef hash. We both agreed that there was nothing super special about the breakfast that made it stand out from other diners, but it was good enough to come back. I also love how convenient it is to my house for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"We're talking about a diner -- so keep in mind what your expectations should be. This is a small, independently-operated breakfast-lunch counter in the heart of the 'Burgh. At this place, you'll get good friendly service and some hot off the grill food. I was here with a friend for breakfast and we were super pleased. Eggs, mighty good home-made home fries, sausage, French toast, coffee, and the two orders came to less than $20 with tip. You gotta support these small businesses, or else they'll be gone. This is not IHOP or Denny's or some other cookie-cutter restaurant. This is an original. Sure, it isn't as clean looking as the other two, but it is down-home friendly."}
{"text":"Hanlon's is a little diner right in the middle of  Liberty ave and very easy to miss. I generally stop in here when I am looking for a cheaper place but pretty decent food. My issue in previous stops was the ventilation was bad and AC didn't keep up with the heat of the grills you can see from your booth. Also, lets face it, most of us would prefer to go back to work not smelling like a French fry. 

Ok, lets stay positive! The service is always good and again the price is right. I have had several items on the menu and I went with a Sicilian melt this time around. As usual, the food is served hot and ready to roll. The portions aren't enormous but they do the job. You can get out of here cost wise in under $10 if you skip the soft drink. I have had a turkey club, salads, burger, chicken fingers basket....just don't expect anything incredible in here. 

I do think its a decent stop and very easy to fit in a lunch hour at work."}
{"text":"Nice menu with all of the breakfast basics, small queue on a Sunday morning but was able to get a booth after a short wait. Clean (mainly wait staff bussing & cleaning tables) and comfortable - but a little cold on the April morning we stopped (seated about half way from the door). 

Ordered quickly but had to wait quite a while for our food to arrive (+15 minutes) after ordering, contrary to a few reviews we had seen. No one stopped to ask for coffee refills although they were stopping by other tables.

Portions were substantial, really good size for the value. The food was very good, well prepared and tasty!

Would go back again, solid business with a lot of local fans & return customers/regulars coming back for a good reason."}
{"text":"I liked the diner-y atmosphere and the unpretentiousness a lot.  I didn't like the coffee being served in styrofoam cups.  The food has to be good if you're going this route, and the breakfasts we had this weekend were not good.  They were just barely OK.  Hence the two stars.  Wish it could have been more."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Saturday around 1:50, we didn't realize that they close at 2. They happily sat us, took our orders, and quickly delivered some GREAT diner food. I had the a burger topped with bacon, onion rings, cheese and bbq sauce, it was fantastic. The burger is an 8 oz. patty that is thin and about the size of a dessert plate. Though they cook all of their burgers to well done it still came out delicious and juicy. It was accompanied by a big, cold, crunchy pickle spear and perfect fries (think long john silvers but not greasy). My friend had the BLT which was also large and packed with bacon. She had the sweet potato fries which were equally crispy and delicious. Our bill for 2 sandwiches with fries, a pickle, and pop was $16! You just can't beat it."}
{"text":"Great place to try for us out-of-towners! 2 adults and 2 kids- three of us got breakfast and lunch for the other.
Pancakes, burrito, eggs and turkey sausage were very tasty breakfast items and the warm BBQ sandwich was nice w/slaw and onion straws on it for the lunch item. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Loved this place,  after the Pittsburgh Steelers kicked the Jets butt we need somewhere to have breakfast the next morning,  I Yelped this place and it had four and half stars, so decided to give it a chance,  the was was awesome,  a lot of food and nicely placed on the plate.  #nomnom."}
{"text":"Hanlon's is yet another place that's oh-so-close to my office yet somehow I've never gotten around to trying. I finally had the chance to stop in recently.  Hanlon's has a typical diner atmosphere and they have typical diner fare, but they're pretty solid. I had me a BLT and coleslaw and they were pretty good.

Hanlon's also does catering so I might consider them for my next office function."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love it there.  We have been there for all three meals and everytime has been a great experience.  The food is terrific and the staff is wonderful and it is a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had the Hanlon Handful; I made mine scrambled eggs, bacon, hash brown, and french toast.  All was good especially the hash brown even though it was a pre-made one.  It had the perfect crunch.  The eggs were not seasoned with salt or pepper, but I add ketchup and hot sauce to my eggs and hash browns so it was ok.  The french toast was good, but it did taste a *little* stale???  I also had coffee and it was weak.  Breakfast came up to $7.04 including tax.  Sweet!

The one downside for me was that I was waiting a while to be acknowledged when I came in.  I did not know that it was a seat yourself.  After I was seated, I did have to wait a few more minutes for a menu, but after that, it was ok.

Oh, and they had a decent radio station playing.

Overall, good diner grub!"}
{"text":"What a great fines in Pittsburgh... The service is great, one of the best omelettes I've ever had, and the price was perfect. It was a great and to my trip to Pittsburgh and a great breakfast for a long road trip home."}
{"text":"The food is good, and depending on the time of day, it comes relatively fast, too. The diner fills up at lunch time, so your food will take a little longer, but mid-morning and mid-afternoon the service is speedy.

My favorites are the chicken quesadilla, the santa fe chicken salad, and the potato skins. Their soups change daily (but French Onion Soup is there EVERY day), and their potato soup is TO DIE FOR. There are a ton of salad, burger, and sandwich options, too.

A lot of people don't know their, either, but you can get pretty much any flavor milk shake you can imagine. The best one BY FAR is caramel cookies and cream. You won't be disappointed.

The prices aren't too bad. It's pretty much what you'd expect at a diner."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I'm always really satisfied with the food! Everything is really good and it's walking distance if you're from Ingram or Crafton."}
{"text":"My dad and I decided to meet up for breakfast before work since we both work downtown. He is definitely into the greasy spoon/diner style of breakfast, and Hanlon's was the right choice.  At 8:00 AM, they had some regulars, but it was pretty quiet. Our food was really fast, and we both made it to work in time for our 9:00 start.

My dad ordered a Sausage, egg, and cheese muffin ($3.99), and I had the breakfast burrito with hashbrowns ($7.99). For downtown, these prices were really reasonable.  My burrito was huge and packed full of cheese, peppers, ham, bacon, and sausage. The muffin sandwich was not quite as big, but my dad ate the hashbrowns and was quite content.

This is definitely more dirty-diner style than is in right now, but our food was good.  Everything was fresh off of the grill, and the staff was really pleasant.  We will probably stop back in again!"}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall for breakfast. Pancakes were very good and the home fries were some of the best I have ever had. I would definetely recommend. Can't wait to go back and try some of their options for lunch after seeing some of the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great, local diner near my work, I often go there for lunch. Hanlon's is not a fancy place, but the food is good and fresh, and won't break your wallet. Plus, the service is fast and super friendly. Can't beat all that! My favorite, go-to menu items include the amazing, cheesy and not-too-salty French Onion Soup, the sharable Tuna and Patty Melts and the burgers, the Duquesne is my usual, but I don't think you'd go wrong with any of 'em. If you're looking for a quick, tasty and enjoyable dining experience, hit Hanlon's up!"}
{"text":"This is a great little greasy spoon diner downtown. I work downtown so I sometimes stop in here during the week and have also been in on the weekends. If you don't want to wait an hour for brunch on the weekends, come here! Long lines for brunch are the worst when you are getting HANGRY on a Sunday morning.

I've had a few of their breakfast sandwiches and it's always been a great breakfast for a reasonable price. Typical diner fare...omelettes, egg platters, pancakes...they have all of the basics. There is traditional diner counter seating and also plenty of tables as well. The kitchen staff and all of the servers that I've encountered are all very sweet and friendly. Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I dig Hanlon's. I love that pretty much all of their dishes come with a side and the price is right. Everything on their menu sounds delish and it takes a little while for me to decide. For any hoagie, you can make it a wrap at no extra charge. I usually order the buffalo chicken wrap & its fabb !! I've also had the eye opener breakfast which is the works (eggs, meat, potatoes & toast) for $4.99. I've never had a salad from here, but they are huuuuge! & only around $9 which is the standard salad price downtown, but I've witnessed Hanlon's using 3/4 a head of lettuce in one salad, awesome!!"}
{"text":"Check it out, a hole in the wall diner. Totally awesome, like I ran inside at 7:30AM, sat up at the counter, got a cup of coffee and ice water. Ordered the Western Omelet and it was HUGE with wheat toast.  Total cost was $7.04.  This place is great!  GREAT!  We need one on every street of America."}
{"text":"A good serviceable breakfast. Wasn't great, but wasn't bad. Just average. We had pancakes and they were OK. Even the syrup was just OK. The bacon is paper thin without much flavor. Only the French Toast stuffed with apple pie filling shined. 

The real stars at this place are the servers. Efficient, friendly and kind. 

I'd go back, but nothing here -- at least regarding what we had -- that I couldn't make as well if not better at home."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting Pittsburgh for a wedding and were in search of breakfast. I don't know if it's because it's Sunday or Labor Day weekend but NOTHING is open. We walked around for 45 minutes before finding this place. It's a total greasy spoon but we are very happy we ended up here.

The food is delicious and cheap. My husband had the mixed grill and I had a large breakfast sandwich. Both were very good. We are very glad we came here!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast, pretty good service, solid neighborhood diner. I would recommend this Hanlon's for a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"This restaurant location has changed hands a couple of times since I started going there. As a bit of a background, I'm in Pittsburgh once a year for Anthrocon in June/July. This diner is very convenient since it is just a short walk from the Westin and the Convention Center.  The first time I saw this place, it was Steel City Diner, which I thought was okay. Then Big Mama's took over this location but lasted only one year because they couldn't get their service up to speed to handle the crowd. Then in 2011, I saw that Hanlon's was in this same location. Essentially, nothing in this place has changed since Steel City Diner. They kept all the furniture and apparently, all the cooking equipment too. One thing I like is service has gotten faster, even if they still do slip up here and there. They brought out a simpler menu and by doing so, they were able to handle the hoard of hungry folks from Anthrocon without slowing down too much. Overall, I liked this place and would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been to an actual \"greasy spoon\" before. I may have thought I had ... but I was wrong. I can now say for certain, I have been christened into the world of the greasy spoon.

T and I ate a late breakfast (brunch is too refined a word) at Hanlon's on Saturday. They had already moved on from their full breakfast menu and were offering a very condensed version which was disappointing. You'd think a place like this would offer their complete breakfast menu all day. I got the 'cakes and bacon and T got the classic two egg breakfast with bacon, homefries and toast. My pancakes weren't cooked all the way through and there were a couple sad strips of bacon on the side that tasted like they were leftover from the earlier breakfast rush. Which, let's face it, they probably were. This was sad because the (somewhat grimy looking) cook (in preparation for the lunch rush I'm assuming) was frying fresh bacon on the flat top the entire time we were there. Pounds of it. I don't know why we didn't warrant a couple of those fresh slices.

T said his was all right ... I don't think he was very impressed. Our waitress was nice but a little spacey on refills. At least it was cheap. An okay start to our first day in Pittsburgh. 

p.s. We think we saw a hooker order takeout. Score."}
{"text":"If you ever have to be around the Mercy Hospital area, your grub options are limited. I think there are a few dive bars, but if you're trying to maintain a professional image at work, you probably don't want to frequent those places mid-day for lunch. Even if \"the food is good here\", people will still make certain assumptions. 

Instead, go to Hanlon's Cafe, which is right across the street from the main entrance of the hospital. I don't know who else would venture here for food besides the visitors and employees of Mercy Hospital because of its location. As much as I enjoyed my breakfast sandwich and listened to my co-workers compliment the sweet potato fries, I still don't think anyone would make a special trip to eat here. But if you do find yourself in this neck of the woods, the food is surprisingly good. 

The actual restaurant is a little strange - it sits in the middle of the 1st floor of a doctor's office / office building, and the entrance is through the staircase (i know how it sounds, but it's true and really is odd). You know you're there because their ventilation is awful. It stinks of fried oil, like you walked into the kitchen of a bad Chinese take out joint. This is probably because of the location - designed originally for a doctor's office, not a local diner. 

Anyway, cheap eats, decent food, quick bite - this place definitely serves its purpose well."}
{"text":"Had The Smithfield Cafe not closed, I would have never found this little hole in the wall.

What do I like about Hanlon's?
- the no-nonsense lunch (the \"business woman's lunch\" as Romey would say) - you're in and out in about 45
- the \"mystery\" items on the menu which always serve as interesting conversation (I can't quite recall, because I'm not writing this in front of a Hanlon's menu, but I believe the \"Pittsburgh Chicken Sandwich\" is made with pork??)
- the big salad

What could be better?
Meh, can't quite put my finger on it, but a little bit of everything?

Maybe it's just not The Smithfield Cafe, which I miss so much."}
{"text":"Bottom line: Hanlon's is your classic \"greasy spoon\"...satisfying, inexpensive, uncomplicated food with a straightforward atmosphere to match. Fantastic, low-key waitstaff who have a list of regulars a block long. Don't expect a five-star meal here, but do expect to leave full of solid cooking, a bit of sassy waitress humor, hot coffee, and the sense that you've really just experienced Pittsburgh at its finest. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. I live in Crafton, and I had never been to this place. Little hole in the wall place. I'm so glad I decided to stop in. I won't be surprised if I become a regular. Love it! Very cute."}
{"text":"Service was awful. We walked in, waited for five minutes for someone to seat us (didn't happen). Sat ourselves. Waited another ten minutes for someone to come over and/or give us menus (didn't happen). Decided to leave and went somewhere else. It was obvious they were completely overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Being a newer resident of Crafton and a breakfast fanatic, I'm always up to visiting little local diners! Sunday morning my boyfriend and I both woke up with some family visiting and decided to head to Hanlon's to get some brunch.

We walked in with no idea what to expect and were greeted with a family-friendly, classic, small town diner feel. These places usually have the best breakfasts! I ordered the loaded home fries and chose sausage, peppers, and onions as my toppings. You can choose 3 toppings (cheese comes with them), and your home fries will come to you still steaming in a big skillet. This is an awesome deal for $5.99. My boyfriend got one of the breakfast meals from the menu, but he substituted the regular pancakes with the cookies and cream pancakes. The menu was hard to choose from because everything looked amazing, and some of the plates were really unique!

The staff were all super friendly and accommodating, the food was great, and the prices were low. It's hard to think of any negatives about Hanlon's. We will definitely go to Hanlon's again, and I'll be looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"Ok I guess...Ate there this morning about 8:45. Sat down, was acknowledged with a nod and be with you in a minute...but was closer to 7 or 8. Ordered \"the handful\" which has 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, and 2 bacon. Wanted to trade bacon for veggies but was told it would be $1 more even though on side items, the bacon cost more than the veggies...go figure.  Make the customer happy and he'll come back tomorrow, don't and he won't.
It was decent, can't complain too much, but can't give thumbs up either."}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious, served in a mug, NOT a paper cup, like one of the other reviewers complained. No city is a real city unless it has an independently owned low budget greasy spoon diner like this place. You can have your Perkins, your Denny's, your Pannekukin, Starbucks, McDonald's, or whatever chain you call it, but, for me, a breakfast at one of these diners is the real deal!"}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place when I was in town and I had to check it out. I ordered the steak hoagie and it was as good as any I've ever had. 

I was back in town a few weeks later and decided to try breakfast. I ordered the mix grill. This had everything but the kitchen sink. Sausage, bacon, ham, mushrooms, 3 eggs, cheese, and home fries all mixed onto one dish. Very good breakfast and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great breakfast menu and good coffee and service, not the newest looking place but the food is very good and the price is nice. It's what I would call a \"greasy spoon\" but in a nice way in which you can find in any town that caters to locals. When I'm staying at one of the downtown Pittsburgh hotels and feeling hungry, Hanlon's is a first choice for breakfast. I've never had bad meal, their lunch based on the menu looks very promising.  I recommend to my friends when ever they are looking for a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Good family dining and friendly service. Fresh food. Excellent breakfast. Not too expensive. Patronize a family place instead of a chain!"}
{"text":"I stopped here before boarding a Megabus to DC.  Full disclosure - I attempted to go to City Cafe, but they had zero seats open.  Literally, zero.  Anyways, I walked back up Liberty hoping to run into a place where I could get some breakfast and kill time.... and I find Hanlon's.  I walk in to a nearly empty restaurant that smells like fryer grease.  I nearly turned around and left, but it was SO COLD that day I figured I'd give it a try.  

I ordered the corned beef hash and a coffee.  To my surprise, the hash turned out to be delicious!  None of that out-of-the-can corned beef crap here!  

If you're looking for a quick, cheap breakfast on the upper end of Liberty Ave, I would recommend this place.  Just be warned that you might be smelling like fryer grease for the remainder of the day."}
{"text":"*** Update ***

I had lunch at Hanlon's Cafe today hoping to up my previous two star rating of it from a prior visit. Unfortunately my first visit was not an anomaly.  

I took a seat at the counter and while sitting there and going over the menu I couldn't help but notice, directly in front of me, about twenty pounds of unpeeled red potatoes. I decided on the Hot Turkey Sandwich which comes as turkey between \"stuffing bread\" covered in gravy and a choice of potatoes. My original potato choice would have been mashed but I was told that there wasn't any mashed potatoes today... a statement that I found to be a bit strange seeing all those unpeeled potatoes right in front of me. No worries, I thought, I'll just go with the home-fries. A little later there was a plate in front of me.  To my surprise the turkey was actually \"real turkey\"; dry as sand, but real turkey. That was as good as it got.  The \"stuffing bread\" was a processed breading mixture cut into squares to resemble a slice of bread. It was pretty awful tasting. Disappointingly the home fries were not home fries at all but rather frozen hash-browns that were deep fried. I ate most of the turkey and some of the stuffing bread and hash-browns, beings that I was hungry, but I certainly wouldn't say that I enjoyed it. 

All in all the meal was pretty pathetic. But the service with a \"splash of attitude\" from the waitress was enough to convince me that I will probably not dine at Hanlon's again.

*** Previous Review ***
Had lunch a Mahoney's yesterday so today I decided to go just a few doors down the street and try Hamlin's Cafe.  

Hamlin's is your classic looking cafe, with booths lining the wall and the center and a counter in front of the griddles with stools.  There are black and white photos of Pittsburgh past adorning the wall. 

The waitress greeted me promptly with a menu and asked what I'd like to drink.  I was happy to hear that they have raspberry ice tea. She went for my drink and was back just as soon as I was ready to place my order.  I selected the hot meatloaf sandwich with mashed potatoes, gravy, and a side of stuffed pepper soup. 

My soup can out within minutes and it was truly delicious! A very heartily serving of soup with ground beef, rice and chunks of tomato.  I thought, \"If this is what I have to look forward to for the meatloaf, my review of this place is going to be sellers!\"  Unfortunately when the main course arrived I became quickly disappointed. 

At first glance it looked wonderful all smothered in gravy.  But then I looked under the bread and found a burnt, skimpy helping of meatloaf in pieces. The best part of the dish was the bread (very fresh) and gravy.  The meatloaf was dry and over salted and the mash potatoes were average at best. 

When my bill came to the amount of $13.80 (plus tip) I did feel a bit taken. But due to the service. I will come back and give Hanlon's a second chance.  The soup was delicious, the service was good and I noticed what other people had on their plates and it appeared to be pretty good.  The wraps looked good and so did the breakfast dish the two fellas in front of me got for lunch. I'm giving it a strong two stars for now based on the burnt meatloaf and plan on coming back hoping I can give Hanlon's a better second review... the wait staff deserves better."}
{"text":"Perfect for Sunday morning breakfast prior to a Cultural District matinee. Great service. Excellent menu. Each dish expertly prepared. Clean, friendly environment."}
{"text":"Do you have a big appetite but don't want to spend a lot of money?  If you are in the Golden Triangle, Hanlon's is the perfect spot for you.  The portion sizes are absolutely enormous.  Every time I've eaten there I have had to leave a little bit on my plate.  He also mixes up a mean malted milkshake (a joy that is lost on too many kids these days).  There is a good-sized crowd at peak times so you may want to go just a little earlier or a little later.  You'll come out stuffed to the gills and your wallet won't be aching."}
{"text":"Staff are so friendly, service is very fast, food is delicious, prices are great. 

I've had an omlette (which comes with toast and home fries by the way, which I opted not to get, but you can spread this across 2 meals really, which I did with the omlette so I can only imagine with the addition of toast and potatoes) and the lo carb special. The lo carb special comes with grilled veggies, which i'm sure vary based on season, bot today it was broccoli, red & green peppers, carrots and zucchini. Awesome! 

Great value all around."}
{"text":"I went to Hanlon's once about 8 years ago when they were near Mercy Hospital, and all I remember was having a burger, but I can't remember if I liked it.

Last week, I popped into Hanlon's new Downtown location, and rather enjoyed my Breakfast Burger, which included a fried egg, bacon, and home fries ON TOP of the patty with a fresh dill pickle shaft. Aside from a bun that could have held up better, that well-done chopped beef (medium-rare is the only way to go, but I can understand the health concerns) still managed to taste darn good and merged morning to afternoon enjoyably. 

The final word on housemade potato chips must be spoken by Hanlon's for theirs are the definition of deep-fried exactness.  

For dessert, my pleasant, perky, petite, and pretty young waitress made me a nut-adorned, whipped cream-crowned hot fudge sundae that came in a styrofoam cup and consisted of a quality brand of prepared vanilla ice cream I promised not to reveal to the public. 

To address an earlier review...

1-The menu was complete when I dined there.

2-Nobody looked \"grimy\" to me. 

3-I saw no prostitutes at Hanlon's, just regular working-class folk like myself.  I know we can be a scary lot to the more sheltered people of the Yelposphere, but damn."}
{"text":"Wait! What? What's THIS? A REAL 'diner' downtown???

Three months new to working downtown again, and I've been searching high and low within walking distance for food. On a daily basis, I walked past this little place and barely looked at it. The front door is recessed, no windows, and certainly looked like nothing fancy...in fact, it didn't look like anything at all.

Then one Friday, I started thinking about that Friday Fish Sandwich, and asked around the office for where I might be able to find a GOOD one nearby. A couple of folks said that I might try Hanlon's, and I said 'Where's that?\" When they told me, I said 'There's a restaurant there?'

So I headed off in the direction of the place I'd passed every day getting to and from the bus, and voila...there it was...in all it's diner glory. Well, kind of like a diner cave. The sandwich board out front advertised the jumbo fish sandwich with fries for $6.99. What the hey, and in I went.

Wow! An inner sanctum of greasy spoon diner, just exactly what a greasy spoon diner should be! Naugahyde booths in two rows, an uber long lunch counter, a lot of people, a handful of real-people waitresses, and a handful of cute regular guys working the line. 

I ordered my fish sandwich to go, paid, and off to the office. 

Pretty damned good fish sandwich (although again on a hamburger bun - seriously Pittsburgh) and a LOT of fish. Good quality fish, decent breading, fried just right. Decent fries. Worth a return trip. Could this be the normalcy I've been seeking?

Even tried the Reuben once, and not bad. I'm a Reuben fanatic, and can easily have four to six Reuben meals in a four day trip to NY, just because I KNOW, regardless of where I get it, it's going to be GOOD - and I've yet to find one in da burgh to rival ANY NY Reuben - but for a Pittsburgh attempt at a Reuben, Hanlon's didn't completely disappoint. 

Then came the no-carb diet, and a lack of food in my house, which forced me into meat and cheese omelet land. Not only were they accommodating with the no potato, no toast request, but after dumping styrofoam into the trash every day in the office, I decided to take in my own container to be green. They were even glad to help there. And...good omelet, filled with meaty bits of bacon, ham, and sausage, gooey cheese, and I do believe real eggs, not poured-from-a-carton eggs.

Went to a meeting there about some banking stuff, and me and a friend and a financial adviser all had a very satisfying diner meal.  The only issue I had that day, never having actually eaten 'there', was that my clothes, including my coat, pretty much smelled like a french fry for the rest of the week.  Well, that and the financial advise issue...

But all in all, this to me is exactly what a diner SHOULD be, reminding me of Jimmy's East Side Diner in Miami. A friendly neighborhood greasy spoon, with a good heap of food, decent prices, an effective and totally unpretentious staff that is friendly and kind, AND they have both Coke AND Pepsi products! Pepsi from the sludge machine, and Coke kept fresh in the sweet cans in the cooler!

A co-worker loves their buffalo chicken strips and fries. And I do have to say, once off the diet, I'll be heading back for some fish - I was hooked.

The prices are very reasonable as well. But friends, it's NOT the Grand Concourse (thank goodness) - it's a diner.  And if anyone out there is confused by what a real diner is supposed to be like - listen up...\"Hanlon's\". Ritter's has cut so many corners, that it's virtually child proof, and Tom's 'diner'? Listen to the song by Suzanne Vega - it's tastier and more satisfying.

I just wish a place like this would actually do the real-city diner thing (other than Ritters) and be open 24 hours. 

I am a fan of Hanlon's...hands down. The little diner that could - and DID!"}
{"text":"Overall great addition to the Ingraham shopping center and great diner. I have only came here for their breakfast and they haven't disappointed. Food is average, you can tell that some of their menu items are frozen. I would recommend their breakfast potatoes over the hash browns and skip the French toast. Service is fast and even if there is a wait it's never long. I would recommend especially since this is the closest breakfast joint to me."}
{"text":"Great food, slow service.  My best friend and I came in and waited at the booth not too far from the door. We waited there for 10 minutes before deciding to move over to the booth by the register. We then sat there and waited an additional 15 minutes. Still no service. It wasn't until Allison, a really nice employee that was in the back, came to the front and walked by us. She took our order and came back with out food 15 minutes later. She was the only one out of the 4 other employees that walked by us over, and over, and over again to take our order. FINALLY! The food it still pretty good, but our to-go order was all fail. They didn't leave any napkins or plastic utencils in our to go bag."}
{"text":"The food was great and cheap, howEVER, you would think the wait staff would bring their AGame on a football Sunday in downtown Pittsburgh.  Our waitress seemed really frazzled and couldn't handle the crowd.  if we didn't wait so long I would have rated higher."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I dined here. It was formerly known as Andrea's restaurant. Came here for breakfast. Waitress is warm, friendly, and very attentive to my needs. I decided to go with the veggie omelet which comes with your choice of a wide variety of toasts and home fries. I went with the rye toast and believe me it did not disappoint. 

Got my food in record time and was amazed at the size of the veggies in this 3 egg omelet. It was so good! I loved the home fries and could only finish half of the bread. They also have smaller portions if you wish as well as pancakes. For $1.00 upcharge you can have your eggs made with egg substitute. They even have a low carb breakfast if you are watching carbs.

This place is reasonably priced and you can get a descent meal for under $10.00. That's the way I like it. Good food at affordable prices. Located on the far end of the Crafton Ingram shopping center it makes a good choice for either breakfast or lunch.

They have their daily lunch specials written on a chalkboard outside. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Good variety. Attentive waitresses. Weekdays are much easier to get a table then the weekend. Great options with a wide variety of food options. Would recommend to anyone looking for a new breakfast diner."}
{"text":"Ugh. Understaffed and overwhelmed. The place was packed on a late Sunday morning, and the staff couldn't keep up with clearing the tables, ran out of dishes, couldn't get the orders correct, and couldn't deliver the right orders to the right tables. I watched 2 tables get up and leave in frustration while we were there, which unfortunately led to even more confusion because no one on staff had any idea which tickets to cook and which to ignore. They twice brought us the wrong food before finally just coming back and asking \"What did you order?\" When our orders finally somehow arrived, both were cold and overcooked, and only 1 was correct. 

The only thing missing was Gordon Ramsey yelling at the staff. Avoid."}
{"text":"The only thing that prevented Hanlon's from being a 5 stars was the service. The waitress didn't seem to know the menu, and she only came around once. We had to ask another server for refills. She also didn't write down my wife's order correctly, and we had to send it back. While we waited, she was just standing around chatting. We don't expect to be treated like royalty, but when one person has their order and the other doesn't, you would hope for some type of urgency. 

With that said, the fact it still got 4 stars speaks to the food. I ordered a ham and cheese omelet with broccoli added in. It was loaded with fresh ham and broccoli and more than enough cheese. My wife ordered poached eggs, which had a heavy vinegar flavor to it, but it's still hard to mess up poached eggs. She really liked her raisin toast, too. 

We will likely come back, just hopefully get a different server."}
{"text":"We loved this place.  It was across the street from the hotel we stayed in and we needed a hearty breakfast that didn't cost as much as our hotel room.  

It was a grungy place inside and out, but that only adds to the experience.  The plates, cups, cooking areas, etc were all clean.  

I got the Greek omelette and substituted the toast & home fires with the French toast.  My girlfriend got scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, hash browns, and French toast.  The food was awesome.  Especially the French toast.  The coffee was typical for a diner, nothing to write home about.

The staff was very attentive and even the cook hollered over to make sure we liked the food.  

Next time my family and I are downtown and in need of a good breakfast we'll know where to stop.

*** I would only recommend that they use paper place mats since the tables weren't the nicest ***"}
{"text":"I love this place. Their menu items have some uniqueness to them as well. The service is always fantastic...the staff is very friendly. Excellent little locally owned diner!"}
{"text":"No hello .. No menus .. Goodbye ... People who came in after us received menus.  Diners in NYC are friendlier.  Be Nice or Leave .. Bull!"}
{"text":"Just tried the Cobb salad for the first time.  Outstanding!!  Generally really like the food here, but wish they'd make chicken soup a more regular part of the menu."}
{"text":"Well, the place is so good at breakfast that I forgot to take a pic of my food. Ordered handful and hit the spot. I've only eaten breakfast here but always hear good things about their other meals. Stop in and try a lovely local cafe."}
{"text":"Great little greasy spoon. Fast service and great food. Exactly what you need to get your day going."}
{"text":"Peopke are warm and friendly. I had their Irish Eyes (eggs, corned beef, potato pancakes, and rye) and it is fantastic! So glad we stopped in!"}
