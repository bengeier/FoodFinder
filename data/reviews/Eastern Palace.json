{"text":"Small little gem hidden in the industrial park. Wonderful buffet at lunch. The food was all a hit, prepared well and the service was great. If you are in Southpointe for lunch, give it a try."}
{"text":"This small Chinese lunch buffet is pleasantly the opposite of most of my buffet experiences. Usually you find a buffet with 10 tables of choices and only one with food worth eating. This place is very small, and only has 2 buffet tables, but everything is great! Prices are great, and I will probably eat here a couple times a month! No buffet at dinner though."}
{"text":"This place was better than I expected. My lo Mein and wonton soup were yummy. The crispy wontons were meh. I'd eat here again when I travel back for work. The staff was attentive yet not hovering."}
{"text":"We were staying next door at the Hilton Garden, and as expected, the hotel menu was expensive and somewhat limited. My wife is a vegetarian and I try to eat a fairly healthy diet. After comparing the two menus we felt that Eastern Garden might better suit our needs. The family running the restaurant was super nice and the lady that took our order described several of the offerings well, so that we knew what the dishes were like.  We chose Bean Curd and Vegetable Soup (for 2). It was a simple vegetable soup with large plentiful chunks of vegetables and tofu which had a subtle garlic flavor and was slightly thickened. I liked that it was not salty so that we could salt it to taste. I wanted a little meat so I got Chicken on a Stick and was surprised at how large the plump pieces of chicken were. They were simply char broiled with little seasoning, not the typical skinny slices in teriyaki sauce that some restaurants serve. I enjoyed these more as the thickness allowed them to be slightly charred  but juicy inside, and because they were lightly seasoned you could tell that the meat was very fresh. The Eggplant in Garlic Sauce was delicious. The sauce was slightly sweet and garlicky and as our waitress had explained spicy. She also said that the spice could be as hot or mild as we wished. We like spice and found it hot but not blazing hot, just about right for us. Our server knew that The eggplant dish is good with rice so she gave us a small free bowl to accompany it. I have had this happen in other good Asian restaurants where your enjoyment of the food is important to them. I am from Boston and the service reminded me of a Mom and Pop restaurant in Chinatown that I loved and ate in until the owner retired. We also got Vegetable Lo Mein which was fairly standard, but obviously cooked to order as the noodles were as they say, 'al dente'.  My son arrived late with a friend as they had eaten at a rehearsal dinner They wanted a snack so he got an order of Crabmeat Fried Wanton. I tried one and it was well stuffed and perfectly cooked like the rest of our meal. I might add that our the servings were large. The diners across from me got what I believe was Chicken in Spicy Orange Flavor (They just call it Orange Chicken in Boston) and the serving was huge. They told us that they ate there frequently and loved the place. I would say that if you like Chinese food that is more authentic than the usual suburban place and more like a good Chinatown place, go there, ask questions, tell your server what you like and you will leave happy, like we did."}
{"text":"I like to order online and then pick it up.   While I've tried the buffet, it's not as good as the takeout.   This is my favorite Chinese in the southpointe/canonsburg area.   If you're staying st the hotel, place an order!"}
{"text":"For a Chinese-American restaurant with a buffet, I am impressed with the quality that Eastern Palace consistently brings to the table.  Have I mentioned yet that South Point is very limited in the restaurants that are close by?  As a man who enjoys Chinese-American, and who happens to work in South Point I am grateful that a place like Eastern Palace is here.  They have won an award which proudly hangs next to the counter. It's a secret shopper award, I believe, if memory serves me.  The award is no joke.  The staff is friendly and even during the busiest of lunch rushes is always making sure your glass is full and your plates are cleared.  For a lunch buffet you really can't do much better than Eastern Palace."}
{"text":"Updating to a solid 4. The more we order food from here the more we like it! I order online every time and money have my husband pick it up on his way home from work in Southpointe. The portions are very large and the food is always ready and waiting for him to pick up. So convenient. The chicken lo mein is great, large pieces of super tender chicken. The honey walnut shrimp is the bomb. Huge pieces of shrimp lightly coated and served with the best sauce. Today we were lucky enough to get some surprise cream cheese wontons with our order! I was so happy cause they are one of my face but rarely order those since my husband won't eat them! Will definitely be ordering again, it's fast and easy and totally worth the price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I ordered spicy shrimp and scallops to go. The order was ready on time and the counter service was friendly. The menu stated that it consisted of jumbo shrimp and sea scallops. What I got was 5 small shrimp and I may have found 4 bay scallops that were smaller than the dice in a Monopoly game. The vegetables were good. Due to the small shrimp and the minuscule size and quantity of scallops, I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I really like Chinese food. My wife puts up with it, but she has been expanding her menu choices and has found new dishes to suit her taste.  That said, she raved about the amazing chicken tonight. It's rare for us to eat Chinese out (generally delivery or pick up only), but its even more rare for her to finish a dish in one sitting.   I had the Singapore style noodles, which while tasty, did not compare to the amazing chicken. My hot and sour soup appetizer, on the other hand, was among the best I've had in recent memory.   The only real complaint is the hours kept by he restaurant. I certainly understand a siesta closing in the afternoons, but closed completely for the weekend is baffling. Not to mention closed at 630pm on Tuesdays and 9-930pm on Fridays."}
{"text":"Started feeling sick on the last day of my business trip so I wanted to eat near my hotel. Soup and tea and dumplings were just what the doctor ordered. Very tasty, and the restaurant was nice and quiet. I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
