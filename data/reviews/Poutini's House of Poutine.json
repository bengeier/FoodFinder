{"text":"I must confess that I've been led astray by additional poutine toppings, heaped onto salty fries and gravy and cheese curds, most of the time eaten at 2am after a night out. But after the glitz and glam of these specialized poutines faded, I ate it less and less and forgot about my love for the beautiful trifecta of curd, potato, and gravy. 

Poutini's has resurrected my poutine love and it has been resurrected as a purist. There's something about the curds that is so delicious and the right amount of salt and flavour. The fries are great (crispy and golden) and the gravy was rich and not too heavy. Best poutine in the city!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place with my brother and his fiancee after a lengthy time at a studio without dinner. My stomach was ready for some action. And like any other Canadian, I love me some poutine. I'm not from Quebec but I've had poutine in Montreal. And as such, I consider myself to be quite the expert on poutine. Alright, not really but I'm not just reviewing this based on a comparison between Smoke's Poutinerie. 

We walked in welcomed by blasting music. It was almost like I was a captive terrorist in for questioning. Anyway, I ordered. It took several times for the person to hear my order. I almost took out paper and a black marker (or went postal on their sound system). Nonetheless, the order was taken and I was that much closer to \"The Works\". I get weak in the knees for any menu item that has bacon.

Sat down on one of their tree stumps (I love the look of the place). But I was slightly underwhelmed. The cheese was, as all the cheese curd aficionados say, \"squeaky\".  Fries were great. The bacon was... bacon (in other words: perfection. I mean, if a place messes up something like bacon I think they should seriously rethink living). The gravy is what made this poutine sub-par for me. Well, maybe \"sub-par\" is pushing it, but it certainly isn't fantastic. I've had better poutine gravy at Toronto Pearson International Airport. Please don't hit me. 

Anyway, bottom line: it was good. Not fantastic, but I'd go there again."}
{"text":"I'm not on the Poutini's train. It's fine but I've had way better in Toronto.

The main issue is the temperature of the gravy - it's not hot enough! The cheese curds remain completely unmelted. It's also not the most rich in flavour. 

My husband loves it so I've had it many times over the years and it is always the same. 

What I do like is the availability of fresh ground pepper, and the option of layering your poutine. 

I'd rather a poutine from Big Smoke Burger any day. If you haven't tried it, give it a go. Gravy is dark dark brown and you get some meltage."}
{"text":"Cheap delicious veggie poutine available in tiny (or giant) sizes. Good selection of sodas. Cute space.
The staff were super nice, and one of them was whistling along to the music playing like she was a song-bird. 

What more could a lady ask for?

It would be nice if they took debit. 
Vegan options available."}
{"text":"I like that this place is open late , for those nights coming home from jays games, out for drinks, etc ... The poutine is good but not my first choice. It does the job when you really need some greasy food in your belly, but the gravy isn't my favourite. Although many do like it, so it's all preference. The staff are always friendly and patient. They serve everyone's orders in a timely manor even when it's busy."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. It's dangerous that this place is literally across the street from me. Best poutine ever. I'm sorry, it just is. No competition."}
{"text":"Poutini's is pretty decent.  

The fries are respectable and crunchy.  I didn't find them excessively oily.  The gravy wasn't bad though I did find it have a bit of a watered-down taste to it plus they were a bit stingy with it.  I got to the bottom of poutine and all the fries were still dry.  The cheese is good and a nice creamy taste to it.

Would I drag a friend to this place?  Not really because of two major flaws with this place:  It's all they way over at Queen St W and Dovercourt.  Way too far for downtown wandering. The second flaw is that there's not much in the way seating.  They do have some chairs inside but it's a bit cramped.

If you happen to be in the area.  Go for it!  You love it.

Quick guide to poutine in Toronto:  Mr. Tasty Fries, Poutini, Smoke's Poutinerie"}
{"text":"As a diehard Smoke's fan, I was hesitant to give Poutini's a try. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I got there. The atmosphere was rustic but with a modern feel, and the crowd felt like a community of sorts. I also appreciate that their containers, cutlery, and napkins are made from recycled materials and/or are biodegradable.

Poutini's offers a wider ranger of gravy options, meaning I no longer have to exclude by vegan and gluten free friends from my poutine obsession... we can all pack on the pounds together! However, I must say their vegetarian gravy is a little too peppery, which was a little bit unfortunate. The size options are a little more manageable than those at Smoke's (seriously, has anyone ever ordered the \"Wow Size\" option) but, at the same time, there is a significantly smaller number of variety in toppings (as a vegetarian and self-proclaimed \"poutine purist\" this doesn't really affect me, but I appreciate knowing I have the option to purchase a poutine that's dressed like an extravagant thanksgiving meal). In addition, it is a bit overpriced... and nothing aggravates me than the dreaded \"Cash Only\" payment option. However, Poutini's scores major points by having a delivery option hosted by OrderIt."}
{"text":"I'm still hopeful that someone in this big city will get Poutine right. Sadly, Poutini's fails the test.

I do believe a better name for this place would be 'Alternatini's', because the vibe here is all alternative. I'm feeling like I'm back in the 80's complete with black walls, pounding retro alternative beats, and cash only. The theme carries over onto the menu with vegan options alongside traditional fare in biodegradable bagasse serving containers.

It's dead on the afternoon we drop in, and we have the pleasure of watching our hostess with the mostess prepare our eats. She's a multi-tasker, and while she's frying up the 'hand-cut' fries, she's portioning the cheese curds in tiny plastic cups. For a moment, I'm excited at the thought of someone actually layering the fries with the curds and gravy but the opposite happens. The fries are tossed in seasoning, packed in their bagasse containers and the cheese curds are turned upside down over the fries and crammed into the container. The gravy is ladled on last. No time for finesse here.

The taste? Well, let's just say it's a good thing I was starving."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I know nothing of poutine. I'm from the central bit of North America and have spent a handful of days in Montreal. I'd never eaten poutine before.

...but I love french fries...good french fries. This place serves good fries covered in tasty gravy and cheese curd, which despite its name, is also apparently delicious.

Is it real poutine? Will it remind you of childhood summers spent in a small town in central Quebec? I don't know. Is it tasty? Yes. My only quibble: it's a little pricey."}
{"text":"Their poutine is dangerously good. Even more dangerous - it's conveniently open while you're stumbling home from the bar. This place gets packed but their poutine is well worth the wait. I tried many of the items on their menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today because I was in the area buying a concert ticket at Rotate This. I had had a previous stab at going to Poutini when I was going to a concert some time ago at the Drake but I found it closed (I went to Pho Tien Thanh instead). 

The first thing I immediately notice when I walk in is the lack of seats to this place when there is clearly enough room for more. I ordered the layered poutine. Although I knew of this beforehand, I was still struck by the chutzpah they had in charging extra for layering even if the cost is really based on \"extra cheese\" (even though the amount of cheese they put in the layered should be the norm rather than the exception). Paid the exact 9.99 (thought it was kind of cute but annoying at the same time how they probably purposely chose a price that would give 9.99 with tax) for it and walked out.  

Fries were crispy and rather tasty just by themselves. Gravy isn't too shabby but not great either. Some of the cheese still felt kind of cold or room temp although I had been outside for all of a minute and a half before I started eating it. It was above average for a poutine in Toronto (which isn't saying much) but for 10 bucks, the value is just not there at all."}
{"text":"Fries are great, nice and crispy.  Cheese doesn't melt (which is good, according to the Poutine Pundit) BUT there just isn't enough!  Only complaints about the gravy is that there isn't enough (like the cheese) as you're left with nothing but fries halfway through."}
{"text":"The only reason I went here was because they have a vegetarian/gluten free gravy. Fries, cheese, gravy - you can't really go wrong when you can't usually eat something like this with food allergies. 

My beef: the music was super LOUD. I felt I had to yell my order. Also thought it was slightly overpriced for the size. Cash only."}
{"text":"Dont try the traditional, get the most expensive pulled pork! It taste so much better than traditional. I give this 5/5, having the meat is so much more enjoyable! It is bbq flavoured pulled pork. Will come and eat again! Nice small size dont make u feel guilty. If you try the traditional you most likely wont like it because it is so tasteless."}
{"text":"The concept is good and they have interesting poutines on offer. Unfortunately the poutine itself is okay but not that great.

I would suggest a trip to Ottawa or Quebec and to ask chip wagon owners how they make such delicious poutine."}
{"text":"I love this place as it's so handy with reference to all the watering holes around here !  
The regular size poutine amply does the trick !"}
{"text":"I don't think that a day goes by that I don't crave vegan Poutini's at some point!  The vegan gravy is home made and spiced to perfection.  A generous serving of Daiya cheese is added on top of the most delicious fries ever!  Do yourself a favour and go to Poutini's - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Poutini's gets a big, fat, meh from yours truly.  Went there on Friday night and there were only 3 other people in the store (there was a giant thunderstorm raging outside, it was around 7pm, long before the strip gets super-bumpin') but I had to wait 15 minutes for my order?!?!  WTF?!?

Listen, I've worked in the restaurant biz (Bymark, Canoe, Sen5es, etc.) and at the height of Summerlicious, when Bymark was pumping out 250 people covers in an hour and a half, it didn't take us more than 2 minutes to put a cone of fries out.  If you're frying pre-blanched fries (which the dude was) there's no excuse for that.

The counter staff were the rude, disaffected, borrowing accessories from native american culture-type.  Most egregious of all, I found the pricing a little unacceptable.   For the regular poutine it's decent, but there's NO WAY IN HELL that \"The Works\" (a regular poutine with sour cream, chives, and bacon) should be NINE DOLLARS PLUS for a \"large\" - is you tweakin'?

I will give them props for the quality of the curds they use - large, squeaky, plentiful.  But Poutini's falls apart for me at the gravy stage - thick, glommy, over-thickened, all you can taste is salt and flour.  It's like a less flavourful KFC chicken gravy.  I'm not even sure what animal's stock it's supposed to be based on, but you don't taste it, that's for sure.

Overall, I'd stay away.  When you can get something midway decent from any number of other places that ALSO have other edible items on the menu, why would you go out of your way for this?"}
{"text":"Okay, Poutine may currently be popular but wait.... Think about it people... This isn't food, it's crap. Poutini's relies on drunk people from west Queen west to mindlessly pour congealed fat down their gullets, giving their bodies the 1-2 punch of binge drinking followed by metabolic abuse. If you had to pay the fractional cost of the associated healthcare along with your order of Poutini's glop you would think twice about shelling out that amount of money. An order of Poutine would cost the same as a sit-down meal at a high end restaurant. I reckon most people would take the nice meal option - especially as it comes with the benefit of living longer.

Think before you eat - even if you've had a few drinks - and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time after moving to nearby, and I was very pleasantly surprised with the food.  Menu was simple but effective.  I had the Works poutine, which was exactly the fixing I needed.  Fries were not too greasy, and not soggy!  Great flavour combo with the toppings.  I actually prefers it over Smokes!"}
{"text":"From the first day it opened till now, a mere 2 years later - the poutine is still my favorite. Yes, I was waiting with bated breath till it opened when the signs were up on the store front taunting me. At least I don't work down the block anymore. I was having it at least 1-2 a week!

I know people try to get all Montreal has the best poutine or whatever, but for my food-know-how palette this is the best poutine in the world.

Squeaky locally sourced curds, gluten-free options for gravy and super friendly staff, plus the use biodegradable cutlery and bowls = happiness

(One time I decided to test out how well Poutini's stands up to other poutine places and my experience at Smoke's was actually one of the worst food moments of my life, so if you like Smoke's but dislike Poutini's well, we'll never be friends and that's cool)."}
{"text":"i love their brunch menu~~my boyfriend had one with maple syrup and bacon, and i had egg florentine with spinach (a little green swept away my guilt). both of them were really tasty. and i didn't find them too salty as others said. the staff were great. i love the fact that all the bacon and maple syrup are from her uncle's farm. i think it is a great place if you just want a snack to boost up your energy while walking around on queen street later on :)"}
{"text":"It doesn't give me pleasure to write such a negative review. 

This place, though it looks cool, has terrible poutine. Nuff said. 

Gravy is never hot, cheese curds are not melted. Cold cheese curds?! You should be ashamed as yourselves!

Even Hero Burgers across the street has better poutine (and this place doesn't even come close to Smokes.)

If you enjoyed this place, you were drunk (which is acceptable as it's a drunk food spot!). 

My two cents, this is a King West joint that focuses on looking good, but not at all on the quality of its product. 

Skip, and if you're 100% craving a poutine at 2:30am, go across the street to the Hero."}
{"text":"We had the BBQ pork poutine and bacon poutine. The BBQ pork poutine was really good, the bacon was very crispy in the bacon poutine. Taste-wise the bbq pork poutine won. There was a generous serving of toppings to last you through the entire experience. Downside was that the music was turned up way too loud when we were there, couldn't have a conversation without yelling."}
{"text":"Firstly, my partner and I are American and have no basis for poutine expectations, thusly giving it a mere four stars.  However, we drove from Niagara Falls to Toronto and got exactly what we wanted from here, which was worth the full impartial five stars.

Did the gravy soak the bottom fries in our regular-sized order?  YES!  Did the curds squeak?  Yes!  (maybe because it wasn't all melted.)  Did the whole concoction taste balanced?  Yes!  Other than that, what could we ask for?  Yes, we'd return.  Yes, the artwork is neat.  Yes, compostable buckets and utensils, and illustrated cans in which to dump them are huge bonuses!  Yes, the staff is friendly.  Yes, it's a tiny, contemporary hole-in-the-wall with a narrowly focused menu, but we found it very well executed.  No, we don't know where the vinegar goes.

P.S. - \"Layered\" means an EXTRA serving of curds throughout, and hence the extra price.  Maybe try tipping the friendly staff and asking them to mix your regular bucket differently?"}
{"text":"The gluten free gravy option is what sold me on this place (as well as the good reviews). 
Great service, yummy poutine, creamy garlic sauce was great too. Also, one of the only places open super late!
My only issue is that at the end your poutine is literally swimming in gravy.
If you're super hungry get the large size (don't be intimidated by it as they don't over fill it so it's just the right amount to fill you up)."}
{"text":"I'm convinced this is the best poutine in the city.
Really crispy twice-fried fries that don't become soggy sticks of sadness under the gravy (this is a rare thing to find!!). Great tasting gravy that is also a great texture. Perfectly bouncy squeaky cheese curds that taste really fresh. The combination of all that, topped with their pulled pork, makes you forget everything else for a few minutes and induces some involuntary head-rolling. 
If only there were more locations! Really not sure how people could possibly compare (or even prefer!) Smoke's to this place. Poutini's is what's up."}
{"text":"In a moment of weakness, my friend and I happened in here.  She had the veggie poutine and I had the reg. poutine.  The fries were cooked perfectly and the gravy/cheese curds were delicious.  I love that all the cutlery/bowls are enviro friendly.  Limited menu and little to no seating - but lots of places to stand and shovel back the big portion.  Plus the staff was awesome.  The girl at the counter couldn't have been happier (and for once not in an irritating way!).  

We left sated and quite frankly in a poutine-induced coma."}
{"text":"As far as poutine goes, these guys know how to do it up. DELISH. Seriously. So why not five stars? Well, two reasons: (1) Cash Only and they conveniently have an in-house ATM that charges you $2 to take out money to pay for your order. That irks me SO much. Not only am I giving you business, you're now making money off of me getting money to pay for my order. And (2) the customer service could be taken up a few notches. Some of the employees act as if they are doing you a favour that they're there. When I say \"hey how's it going\" and am met with *straight face blank stare* \"what can i get you?\"...it's not exactly welcoming. For those 2 reasons, I much prefer going to Smokes."}
{"text":"Good poutine. Gravy was top notch. Curd texture met my wife's standards. Good thing its close to the addiction and mental health center..."}
{"text":"My husband is lactose intolerant so finding a place with a vegan poutine was awesome! Plus it was sooo yummy! Defintely reccomend this place."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for poutine...love that they have veggie gravy, the only downside is that it's a cash only place and I never have cash."}
{"text":"Seems like most of the reviewers here have hit the nail on the head.

Like others said, I was nervous, excited, depressed, elated, concerned, impatient, and possibly a little gassy when I saw there would be a poutinery opening around the corner from my place.  After experiencing Smoke's on Adelaide, I thought Toronto was finally ready to really embrace poutine (let's face it, that stuff you get at Burger King is nowhere near poutine).

But as has been echoed all over this page, everything about this place is average, which was hugely disappointing to me (though there's also a part of me that's quite relieved it fell so far short of its addictive potential).  Most frustrating for me (beyond the lack of options) is that they actually have a baked potato on the menu - with cheese curds and gravy as the only options for toppings?!?!  This place is just far too lean in the menu and a little too after bar fast food in its approach (its doesn't come close to a place like Pita Pit in terms of variety/options).

The one thing I will say for the place is that if you've enjoyed copious amounts of adult beverages and REALLY need to dump a large greasy blob in your stomach, their standard poutine certainly hits the spot and the serving size is apparently just perfect for both 6 foot 200 lb+ guys and 95lb girls in cocktail dresses.

Much to my disappointment, this \"house of poutine\" may have set the anglophone poutine movement back a few years.  Now Montrealers have just one more black eye to point to on the face of Toronto-based imitations of their cuisine.  I only pray the owners aren't planning to opening up a \"Smoke-meati's House of Smoked Meat\".  I've endured enough mocking from Montrealers, thank you very much."}
{"text":"I hate these hipster places that charge stupid amounts of money for stuff like fries because their establishment is a stupid hipster place..... Poutine is ok...That's it..... The portions are sucky for the price.... Only reason it got 2 stars was because of the pulled pork Poutine which was alright..... But you can put pulled pork on a shoe and it would taste good.... I will not come back here and not recommend to anyone..."}
{"text":"I used to love poutinis, but I go to smokes poutinery now solely based on the ambiance of the place. THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD. That is not how you do business. 

I understand that poutinis is a takeout joint. No bathroom, just grab your food and get out. I can't tell if the blaring music is simply the product of childish staff who don't care about the customer, or if it is a tool to get the customer out because they don't want to encourage dining in.

The lack of seating and bathroom are hint enough that it is not a \"dine in and sit there for half an hour\" kind of joint, so they really don't need the music to flush me out of the place.

If the music is a result of immature staff who don't understand the real world of work and customer service, then I suggest rigging up their own personal speakers for their own personal music in the back kitchen area where customers don't have to be subjected to  ear splitting music.

Last time I was in they were blaring terrible rap.
Second last time I was in they were blaring crappy pop and rock.
I can't be bothered to go again. I used to go all the time. No more.

PS- I'm not a 70 year old, I am actually young and I enjoy listening to loud music. I just don't like to be subjected to other people's taste in music at 500 decibels."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Always the best service and yes, they have vegan poutine! It is indeed yummy with the Daiya brand cheese that melts to ultimate yumminess. Plus there is a super cute guy names Chris who works there with glasses and a beard who makes coming in there even more worth it. :)"}
{"text":"Again, I too have to agree with most of the reviewers.  The hubby and I were excited about trying this place out. In NYC there are a quite few places that offer gourmet french fries with gourmet dips, but no poutine.  So we were so excited to see the Canadian original french fry dish being the main focus of the business. Our expectations were like the first reviewer--some sort of variety of poutines to be offered.  Unfortunately, just meat/vegetarian and fries/baked potatoes options were available (i.e. no alternative toppings) . The fries were okay, the gravy was fine and the curds alright.  I found that the fries and gravy were a decent price, but the poutine was a tad expensive.  The hours are great for people out late at night.  Overall okay, but the variety of poutines can definitely be expanded."}
{"text":"We made a trip to Poutini's after having tried Smoke's.  I didn't mind that Poutini's had a much smaller menu, actually it made me hopeful that the few options they offered was more awesome.  We ordered the poutine with chives and sour cream.  The gravy and cheese curds were good - would have liked the cheese curds cut smaller and melted like at Smoke's or at least squeaky so I knew they were fresh.  The sour cream added a nice thickness, but there were so few chives added that the flavor was completely lost.  Plus, they only added a dollup of sour cream and sprinkle of chives at the very top, so once you're through the first layer after a few bites, you might as well have ordered the classic."}
{"text":"This is my best poutine in Toronto. I finally met this excellent one, after several places. I love this cheese curds! Staff is very friendly.
?????????????????????1???????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I only ever really come here when its really late (after 12 AM), and the reason why I'm giving this place a five star is the service is extremely fast, and they deal with the craziness really well with the after 12 AM crowd.  I usually get a pull pork poutine and it never disappoint,  I've also tried their vegetarian gravy which is quite good actually. If you're around the area late night and want to eat or snack on something I would definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"People always gushed about this place when I first moved to Toronto, and a friend took me there on my second day. The fries were kind of soggy, and the cheese was clumped together in a mass that had to be eaten around. Because we were the the only people there at the time I just assumed they had the B-Team working during a regular lull, but on my second trip, when they were fairly busy, I again had soggy fries with the so-so gravy. Fries are the main component! If you can't do that right, you can't be a poutine place. And while I'm down with different gravy variants on poutines, theirs just doesn't sit right with me. That's 2/3 components down. I guess their curd options are fine, so that's a 33% grade.

There's an episode of Anthony Bourdain's show where he is taken here, and asked by the owner how his poutine stacks up to that in Montreal. Bourdain plays it off saying that he \"doesn't compare people like that,\" or some such nonsense. When I saw it I thought that he appeared to be avoiding having to say that it wasn't very good, and now I can 100% confirm that hunch.

Just go to one of Smoke's locations; this place doesn't come close to living up to the hype."}
{"text":"As a Canadian living in Ontario, I have tried many poutine's at restaurants and fast-foods like Harvey's, Pickle Barrel, Burger King, Big Smoke's, etc. (JUST HAVE NOT TRIED POUTINE IN MONTREAL YET :( )

&& I can say that I really like the poutine here ! Everyone has their own personal taste for every food. The only downside that I am going to give to this place is :

1) it is a CASH ONLY place
2) there is only one location 

I do like this place better than Big Smoke's 

It would not hurt to try this poutine place if you are around the area :)

But overall, I usually like all the poutine I have tasted :3 poutine is always yummy in my tummy!"}
{"text":"Out of the popular spots that offer a Vegetarian Poutine - this I have found to the best.

- the gravy tastes better and is actually hotter than Smoke's, thus making the curds to  melt as they should in a good poutine.

- the wait staff I have found to be considerably more pleasant and friendly then Smoke's."}
{"text":"I really want to like Poutini's more... I mean they have vegetarian poutine!.. and I'll give them props for that. It's a prime location for me too (I heart Parkdale) and who doesn't adore their storefront sign? (fingerpoint & \"Om nom nom\")

But, like a few have already mentioned, it is hella salty. Buzzkill salty. And not melty enough.. melt the friggen cheese! :( 

After a late night of drinking might be the only time I'll have it now... if I can tolerate the line up and obnoxious drunks.. on second thought that would require a fine balance of drunk and sober on my part to be tolerable.. which is near impossible to achieve. 

I really, really do want to like it more... but until they bring that overpowering sodium down Smoke's Poutinerie is def better, however I can only speak for the veggie versions."}
{"text":"In the past I've had times when I've been at work and have had a craving for a simple and tasty poutine. Today was one of those days. There are two places serving poutine near my place of work and I only choose this one as it required less traveling on an already hot day.

Ok enough of that, on with the review.

Their menu offers some different kinds of poutine ranging from the regular everyday poutine up poutine that has bacon. They also offer menu options for Vegetarians and Vegans as well.

I ordered the Poutini's Poutine with Traditional Gravy. It came in a bowl made of the same material as the old fashion french fry plates.

Overall the fries we're hot and fresh. A fair amount of gravy was also added. My biggest complaint was the cheese. The best way I can explain this is that my eyes we're telling me I was eating poutine but my taste buds we're telling me I was eating fries and gravy. The cheese had very little flavour and made the poutine itself disappointing.

Positives:
- Options for Vegans and Vegetarians
- Good amount of gravy
- Container is recyclable

Negatives:
- Cheese needs more kick!
- Very little seating. Be prepared to stand.

Neutral:
- Cash only but ATM provided on-site."}
{"text":"If you are craving for poutine, this spot isn't bad but it's no Fritz Fries (Vancouver). Although I gotta say, they pick the best ingredients to make their poutines and after a small bucket of french fries, gravy, and cheese I don't feel as bloated or disgusted as I usually do. 

This might be an insult and I apologize to the owners of the establishment,  but Costco isn't a bad alternative either for a poutine."}
{"text":"What's street meat when you have Poutini's?? This is my all time fav place to hit after a night out in the city.  That 'after beer buzz' needs calming before you end the night? Get over to Poutini's for Toronto's BEST poutine ever.  Always hot, always cheesy and always savouring to the soul;0)  This place doesn't shut down until 3:30am on fri/sat. There's a line up that normally stretches outside but it moves ever-so quickly.  And the staff there are madd friendly and cool.  Ready for an after-party?...in your tummy! Lol...great eats with great peeps!"}
{"text":"You don't even know how many hangovers this place has cured. You don't even know...

I used to live across the street and I'm pretty sure half the reason my boyfriend would ever be excited to come see me is because there was a chance he'd get to visit poutinis.

The bacon poutine is to die for and damn do they load those babies up with bacon.  They are not kidding around. Sure it can be considered sort of costly, but they're using real cheese curds and other quality ingredients and that's key

Cute decor. Every time I'd wait for my food I'd admire the huge mirror and wood seats/benches.

My only issue is that they only take cash. Yes they have an atm, but cmon let me use my plastic! Also, most the staff was nice but I've also had a few with BRF and it hurts my soul to be hungover and deal with attitude at the same time. 

In any event, they have a great thing going and they're certainly in the right neighborhood to reach the right customer base."}
{"text":"My sister took us tourist types here to sample proper poutine. I got a tiny traditional (more than enough for a me) and it was hoovered up in a minute. Only niggle is they need more seats."}
{"text":"Good poutine. Neat place. Love the 3' tree stump stools."}
{"text":"What on earth...?  No stools?

I was a little taken back by the fact that there were no seats here.  I saw two stools by the front window, taken up by two plus sized men who were appeared to be regulars... but that was it for the entire restaurant.  Odd.  Maybe they wanted you to eat real fast and get the heck out.

Being first timers here, we opted for the traditional which consisted of just gravy and cheese curds.  There were plenty of other options:  some with sour cream, some with pulled pork, and all different kinds of combinations that is a guaranteed to start a heart burn.  

The potatoes were tasty but lacked crunchy texture (I know the gravy kills it in a poutine, but it was kind of soggy from the get go).. and the cheese never really melted properly because the gravy was not hot enough.  I like my poutine to be sloppy and stringy.  :)

So overall, I have to say that I was slightly disappointed from a place that specializes in poutine.  I also have no idea why BlogTO ranked this place as 3rd best place in Toronto for fries.  Whaaat.. crazy fools."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the wait of 15 minutes for veg gravy on my traditional poutine. It was also quite limited in gravy, as in totally dry after the very top, and very salty. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"If you're used to great Montreal poutine you'll be disappointed. Cheese curds not squeaky enough, gravy is bland and not enough to cover all the fries. If you really really want poutine at 3am then go for it, but otherwise not worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome fries; however, a poutine cannot be judged based on a single good ingredient.it is a rare food that needs all 3 components to be nailed. Cheese is ok but their gravy is awful. Smokes is way better period."}
{"text":"If you are vegan and/or gluten-free and you've been feeling poutine-deprived, please rush on over to Poutini's for an extremely satisfying fix. That's right, they are willing and able (and eager!) to make poutine with vegan, gluten-free cheese & with vegan, gluten-free gravy. Thank you Poutini's!

The atmosphere is take-out-ish, with a few bar-stools and tables for lingering while you dine. (I really wish they'd get more stools and more comfortable stools.) They accept cash only, so be prepared. It's so delicious, so you won't even mind that the stools could be more comfortable and that they don't take credit/debit. Just go there and eat your vegan, gluten-free poutine. Yum."}
{"text":"eh... not a huge fan of poutine but came here to see what the fuss was all about after reading about it in NOW. lets just say it was nothing special at all. the fries were somewhat hard, as though not cooked through - not the most pleasant of textures. they were smothered in gravy. i do not mind gravy BUT when your fries are swimming in liquid salt, something becomes amiss... especially in your mouth & stomach. the cheese curds weren't bad, there should have been more of them in relation to the amount of gravy. i probably won't be coming back here. not only is poutine a heart-attack waiting to happen, this place doesn't even have poutine worthy of one (horrible joke, i know)"}
{"text":"I was bombed when I bought all the Poutine in this place... And man did we have fun Poutine-ing it in our faces. We got a standard, one with pulled pork and a spicy one. All were delicious. And so fresh. And they tasted just as good hung over.... So I thoroughly recommend this place. Take a number. Get on line... And get ready for a taste explosion!"}
{"text":"Simple and quick! I must have came here just in time because there was no line or wait. I'm not a poutine connoisseur but I can be a little particular when it comes to cheese curds. I like my cheese gooey and melted. I had both the regular poutine and the bacon one. Both were good but the cheese curds were pretty solid and not melted. I'd still go back to the place if I'm in the area....and maybe ask them to pop the the poutine in the microwave to get them cheese curds melted a little more lol."}
{"text":"The place is nice looking.  But, I've had way better poutine.  We orderd a bacon poutine.  It was just okay.  The bacon was chewy and wet (most likely because it was the microwavable kind), the cheese curds were okay and the beef gravy tasted like it was straight out of the can.  The fries were not great.  You're probably better off going to Smoke's instead."}
{"text":"I always get \"the works\" when I come here. I have to say this is probably the best poutine in Toronto. It's better than smokes poutine. Expect a line but the line moves pretty fast. Cash only"}
{"text":"After reading several decent reviews - decided to try this place.
Paid for street parking right outside - convenient.

When we arrived - there was one other customer waiting.

Short version - it was overpriced and undersized - underwhelming.

No bathrooms for customers
No debit cards accepted
No credit cards accepted

Cost $26.13 for 2 poutines with 2 drinks.

Real cheese curds -that was about the only saving grace."}
{"text":"I loved the bacon and maple syrup poutine!"}
{"text":"Decent, but felt like the expectations were too high for it based upon reviews I had read elsewhere.  

Great food when you're drunk.  Good enough when you're not.  

However, my poutini was layered which I specifically asked for, which is one thing they did well.  

If you're in the area, its a safe place to head to.  Not a place to drive more than 5 minutes for."}
{"text":"In sense of texture - not cheap type of crispy, but properly fried crispy.
Flavor - salted proper amount (5star worth)
Amount vs price - a bit more expensive than regular fries shop
Location and atmosphere - very nice location and atmosphere but the restaurant is on the smaller side
Tips - If you are the type to ENJOY food as art, not see it as recommended daily substance intake, order small. By the time you finish the top part, bottom of the container gets cold and soggy. If two people buy one large, good amount."}
{"text":"$7 poutine?  I don't care if the fries were hand cut by the Pope himself, that meagre serving of poutine is not worth $7.  If it's late at night, and you're tempted by Poutini's, keep walking up to the Lakeview Lunch and get an acceptably priced poutine."}
{"text":"I have to admit that my perspective may be skewed. I have been to Poutini's a number of times; but only after leaving some bar on Queen West after 02:00. My experiences have always been pretty good. Many times what makes this a great place is the conversations you get to have with other hungry after-bar people while you're waiting in line for some grub. That, and the gravy (which I find to be superior to Smoke's).

I have had straight-up, regular, original recipe poutine; but I prefer to get \"The Works\" which comes with bits of bacon, sour creme, and chives on top... then I squirt a puddle of sriracha in the corner for dipping later on.

The containers are round cup-style containers, which are friendlier for eating on the go than the square packs at Smoke's but the packaging at Smoke's does have the upper hand in transportability (which may be moot as I almost always demolish whatever I've ordered immediately, on site).

Well there you have it... 

Tied with Smokes on: fries, container, cheese curds, service

Edge goes to Poutini's on: gravy-quality

Then obviously Smokes has all their novelty add-on flavours; but sometimes you just want your poutine the way that Jean-Paul Roy intended."}
{"text":"Coming back from Glitch Mob, the tiny place blazing with it's open sign and the crowd of drunks around it makes this the go-to fry joint for everyone looking to end the night with some grub. Open at 3am - Sweet deal. 

I'm not sure how I feel about the chunks of cheese just chilling on the top and 2 stingy squirts of gravy. The cup was a bit deep and the bottom fries got NADA!. The fries have skins on them that really tasted horrible if it wasn't hot. 

Walking in, the place looked like it was THE spot for after-hour recovery. Dirty, sticky floors and questionable forks. The staff - shockingly - were very polite. 
Very loud and be prepared to face a scary number of loser drunks that probe you with stupid questions. 

I'm not a big fan, the small cash register area is pushy and dirty!

No deal for me. 

xoxo

{"text":"Poutine is good but staff is literally sad. Extremely rude and lazy. Girls (short blonde Bob, other with super short masc haircut) handling gravy and cheese sneezes all over their hands and don't wash them. Customers kindly ask to wash their hands before handling food and they reply with a rude tone that they are touching a spoon and not food. Not to mention that they serve cold fries and gravy to customers and if you dare say anything they act like you're being a bother. They also scream your order 5 like they're in the army or like you're deaf even if you're standing right at the counter, make sure not to miss it or the rolling eyes will come shortly after. Sorry, not everyone comes here wasted. I know you probably hate your job, but this is a customer service job. Smile, serve and say thanks."}
{"text":"As my first time trying poutine, I am quite impressed. However, from reviews read about Smoke's, I think the next time I go to Toronto, I'll head there. The gravy was a bit on the bland side, and turned out also to be very greasy. However, as my first time trying poutine, it was actually delicious! I am quite impressed with this small place as much as I am impressed with Canada (which is much more open to culture than the U.S., my home country :-| )! Overall, I'll definitely come back to Poutini's!"}
{"text":"The location is right on queen. It's actually very tiny when you walk in. There's 3 bar tables with 2-3. stools each. So really it seats not very many people. This location only takes cash and there's no washrooms available to customers. It's really a grab and go place. They also have a bench outside too.

The Poutine it's self was very tasty. They have a regular Poutine and a layered Poutine. The difference is that the layered one has cheese layered in the middle. I feel like all Poutine should have it.... 

There's two sizes of poutines a tiny and a regular. The tiny is a very good size for a snack and the regular is quite big, good for sharing. They also have gluten free and vegan free gravy which is a nice option."}
{"text":"Late night snacks are hard to judge because you're usually there due to hunger after a night of shenanigans. From the looks of it, Poutini's seems to be a popular place for late night snacks especially with the Drake Hotel just down the street. When you walk in, you'll be quick to deduce that space is limited and especially when its crowded from the clubbing crowd, your best option is to buy and dash. The place definitely feels like a fancier and hipster version of Smoke's Poutinerrie.  

The menu is pretty simple to navigate through and everything on the menu sounded really appetizing. We ended up going with the The Works poutine and the Pulled Pork poutine. Personally, I definitely preferred the Pulled Pork poutine over the Works just because the pulled pork sauce was just amazing and I definitely could've been full with the small size they had. 

The service was decent but I wish the people were a little more friendly but I guess I'd be annoyed by the late night crowd as well. Unfortunately, they only take cash here so make sure you do have cash! Pricing is a little higher than your regular poutine spots as well but the quality justifies the price. I would definitely go back here when I'm in the mood for a pricier light night snack."}
{"text":"OK Poutine is just bad. In theory, it's not something you should really eat.

But I was at this location in December and boy was the poutine great. I think I had some meat on it, pulled pork? They were out of smoked brisket. All good flavors and such good fries. Worth the small heart attack.

A regular customer thought the best one was The Works, yeah I think sour cream might be good.

Like any new fast Toronto takeout, the pricing is kind of 'are you f--king serious' but at least here the food certainly doesn't suck and the service wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I've never felt fatter and more bloated than the morning after eating at Poutini's.  The unsightly mess of gravy, curds and fries goes down like wallpaper paste. I agree with another Yelper: after getting through the initial layer of gravy, you're left with a container of mediocre soggy fries. It's also extremely salty. 

Once was enough.  Maybe it's a Canadian thing to enjoy this culinary car crash."}
{"text":"First timers and we enjoyed it!  Had the traditional and the onion/mushroom (added bacon)."}
{"text":"Alright, so I read about this place on one of those blog TO sites or some publication that raved about it. My buddy and I finally made our way down there tonight to try it out. 

We managed to get paid parking on the street right outside. We walk into the place and there is one other customer waiting for his order. My buddy and I order the layered poutine which basically means you pay extra and get a second layer of cheese. It was our guarantee they didn't scrimp out on that. It was about $10 for a regular size, the only other size they call is tiny. Their regular I would say is the equivalent to Smoke's Poutinerie small size. I'm not giving credit to Smoke's here because lately they've been sucking too.

Of course they don't offer debit or credit. It they have the no name ABM in the corner you can use for a service fee. What year is it here?

The tables were dirty, the gentlemen who cooked the food was wearing shorts and a shirt that looks like it's never been washed. 

They have no washroom for customers to use. 

The food. Ok the cheese curds were good, fresh and with lots of squeak. The gravy had no taste. It was very thin and well tasteless. What good is a poutine without a good gravy. The fries were soft and starchy like they weren't cooked enough. Actually they weren't blanched first is the problem. 

The only reason they get two stars instead of one is because they used real curds. 

All in all a disappointing experience and I won't be back. Hopefully they can address these issues for future customers."}
{"text":"We didn't like it.  The poutine was not done properly.  My friend said there was no flavour and I would have to agree with her.  For a place called Poutini's you would think they would have the best poutine.  Well all I have to say is: think again.   

We both wanted to try this place for the longest time, and we both regretted it."}
{"text":"Excellent poutines at a fair price. Fresh cut fries that are deep fried, delicious gravy, crispy amazing bacon (you can get maple  too), with gravy (Gluten Free option available), and cheese (Vegan option available).  Not a lot of space to sit and eat but you grab your poutine and go! The staff there on Friday night were great!"}
{"text":"As a guy born and raised in Quebec and because it's trying to pass a poutinerie, I have to give it 1.5 stars. Everything is wrong. The fries, the gravy and the cheese are simply wrong. You would think that it would be easy to get those 3 simple ingredients right but it's not.

If you're truly a fan of authentic poutine, this doesn't even begin to be anything close to the real thing."}
{"text":"The Poutine is good. Service always something to be desired but the worst part is that they only accept cash. 

Having an ATM is not a good solution. It's called square, very affordable for small businesses. Get it. It's 2017."}
{"text":"As a Montrealer, born and raised, I have to say Poutini's is just fine for getting my poutine fix when in Toronto.  Nope, it isn't like my beloved Banquise or Poutineville, it's slightly different, but different is good!  I don't travel to a different city to eat the same things I could have at home.  But when I was coming down from a blast of a wedding, and needing my traditional \"on the way home\" poutine, Poutini's was mighty apt for the job.

I really liked all the different types of poutine available.  There really was something for everyone.  I enjoyed a sour cream/bacon/chives poutine, and D enjoyed the one with extra cheese studded throughout.  Yum!  My only complaint was that there could have been more gravy, I like my gravy! 

The restaurant itself is just ok.  We got take out, which suited us fine so we could enjoy our poutine while sprawled out in our hotel room.  I found the music rather loud for a Sunday evening, but I just rolled with it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Worth the wait in the line up out of the door at 3am! All expectations were met!"}
{"text":"There's not much to say, so I won't say much.

Johnson C. introduced me to the existence of this local establishment. When I first heard of the word 'Poutini', I imagined a gypsy caravan themed food truck dispensing potatoes driven by some hairy nomad who cuts at every corner he finds. What I found upon arrival was your above average hole-in-the-wall with expensive looking tree trunk seating over not-so-wobbly tables, and effigies of the things they adored and despised. 
\"Washrooms are not available, we are operating under a refreshment license\", or a sign pretty close to that effect hung on the door leading to the downstairs area where a functioning washroom so obviously have had to exist. What on Earth is a 'refreshment' license? Clearly, this was a restaurant that didn't take any shit from its customers. So I kept to myself about the offensive painting on display of this fine city's Mayor. 
After all, they were preparing my food, and certainly I was no fool, despite being able to see into their kitchen that reached inwards. 

One man took my order, another prepared my poutine. I do not introduce this simplistic dish to my daily, weekly, or even monthly dietary routines, because it's damn simple to make, and the idea of this food is just lazy on the most compelling level. 
The only time in my life where I yearned for poutine was during junior high, where the rich kids would have the money to go across the street to the Pickle Barrel and buy a box of the stuff for take-out, and have a swarm of less privileged kids vulturing around them for sympathy fries. I of which was guilty of such adolescent calamities. Ohhhh, the tragedy of not having MONNNNEYYY!

Large curds of cheese smothered under a flavourless gravy sheltered over a somewhat small portion of fries that wasn't small enough to inspire complaint within me. 
One wanna-be chef to another; I believe the secret to a good poutine is a spiced/flavoursome gravy. Otherwise, it's like going to a Chinese restaurant, and ordering a bland stir fry over white rice. It doesn't make sense.
Sure, add bacon here, whatever other ingredients there, but the body is still in the gravy. Otherwise, Poutini's is pretty good. I wouldn't call it creative, but the selections of poutines are reasonably satisfactory. The prices doesn't hurt, but then again I'm not a regular.  Despite the casual nonchalant looking staff, the service here is actually very friendly and casual. You are buying fries here after all. Which I suspect is the main reason for the clean atmosphere, solid furnishings, borderline 'art', and good lighting. It's equivalent to trying to give character to hot dogs. 
Fries is like the bastard child of potatoes. Think of it as a hot dog; alone, a sausage can  be fine, juicy, even exquisite. Put it in a bun, and all hope of humanity is lost.
Poutine is kind of the same thing. But both poutines and hot dogs can be delicious, as long as it is prepared right and keep it real on what it is that we are actually eating. 

There is potential for Poutini's House of Poutine, but only if they start experimenting.
I'll make you some poutine Johnson, for now your money is better in my pocket. 
If your name is not Johnson; I guess I would recommend it if you really like poutine.

Hmm..I think I said too much."}
{"text":"Not the best poutine, but far from the worst; with crispy fries, a flavourful gravy and a fair portion of cheese curds, their poutine was tasty, not overly salty. They had a good variety of toppings to choose from as well. Underestimated the cup sizes and got the large portion size which was priced fairly ($8 for traditional, ~$11 for Montreal smoked meat) and very filling. With a spacious interior, casual atmosphere, and friendly employees, it was a good experience, would recommend if you're looking for something other than Smoke's to satisfy your poutine craving!"}
{"text":"When I tried Poutini's traditional poutine for the first time, I had already spent a few 14-hour days setting up an art show at the Gladstone. So, sleep-deprived, hungry, stressed and craving nasty junk food, my friends and I decided poutine was the way to go. It was too early in the day (about 12pm) for Gladstone's kitchen to make poutine, so we decided to order take-out from Poutini's. 

What a disappointment. All I remember is salty, salty, salty gravy over my fries. I couldn't even register the flavour of the cheese curds, since the gravy was so overpowering in its saltiness. Even as hungry as I was, standards already low for the day, I couldn't finish my dish. Why so salty, Poutini? 

I can't speak to the service, since my friend picked up the order but for a restaurant that specializes in poutine, I expected much more."}
{"text":"Walked by this place on the weekend and it was closed during business hours because the staff had walked out to protest their working conditions. I read about the issues on a local news forum. I won't bother trying this place again unless I read about improved working conditions or a change in ownership. 
I also checked the DineSafe website and  noticed there have been health code violations at this location this month."}
{"text":"So when I knew I was coming to Toronto, I contacted Jennifer B and asked what were some of her most do's. Top of her list was poutine.  When I arrived on yesterday, my cab driver from the airport mentioned that his favorite poutine place was on my block so I had to try it out.  It's a new location for an existing business. This location has only been here a month,  so I guess I get another Toronto FTR! 

It's a small shop and up a short flight of stairs with zero seating, unless you count a bench wear you can wait for your order.  They offer veggie and vegan friendly poutine as well as extra meaty.  They were out of the blue cheese flavored mayo that I wanted to try but had little go containers for ketchup or malt vinegar, if that's your thing. 

Service was quick and friendly and I food was well packaged even though I didn't have far to go. The curds were thick and creamy and my veggie gravy was a good consistency and not too salty. 

This location takes credit and debit cards! They also sell a few soft drinks and water. 

All and all an excellent introduction to poutine!"}
{"text":"Ugh, a salty, revolting glob of grease.  I guess I hadn't had enough to drink, because there was no saving that oil spill, I only had a few bites and tossed my $8 \"Classic Poutine\" in the trash."}
{"text":"Poutine All Day Everyday!!

Poutini's is an attractive, industrial-style restaurant that serves a wide variety of interesting poutines right on Queen Street West! (North of Liberty)

Heads up! Poutini's is a cash only restaurant. 
- ATM located inside.

Poutine wise, they have everything from Traditional to Smoked Meat poutine. 
I was inclined to get the larger size because YOLO and since the small was kid sized...

The highly of my Traditional poutine was the Cheese Curds and Gravy! 
Their cheese curds arrive fresh from Maple Dale Farms, delivered every other day (which maintains their squeakiness). 

In case you happen to be vegetarian, they have Vegetarian Gravy! Made in-house daily by roasting a variety of fresh vegetables.

I think Poutini's is an excellent poutine spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I have never had Poutine before, and visiting Toronto seemed like the time to do it!  Granted, I do not know what makes for \"quality poutine,\" but this stuff was pretty good!  My sister, brother-in-law, and I searched it out because they had vegan poutine!  So, as a vegan I got some fries with vegan gravy and melted Daiya cheese.  It was pretty delicious--just about what you would expect, really.  My only complaint would be that the fries could have been better.  These were like, brownish, oven-baked, mushy sort of fries.  I would have prefered shoestring or steak fries, but maybe that's just not how poutine works.

Sucks that you can only pay in cash, especially when you're running around with American Visa cards, trying to find an ATM or bank that can help you.  It also sucks that there's no bathroom!  It also sucks that there are only two sizes that are very different in size.  I want the medium size of poutine that does not yet exist!"}
{"text":"It's more about the experience than the food. At 3am, standing in line and ordering something that is entirely unhealthfully decadent. You've always got to keep an eye on your friend- how much did (s)he drink? So many different options at Poutini's which is why they are so popular. I was so excited to eat the vegetarian version, I had to get it, and made my SO share it with me. 
Well, it tasted, like how most people think vegetarian is supposed to taste. Lots of salt, but not a lot else. I've had some great vegetarian gravy, so I was disappointed. 
But, the experience, brought me back to University days when it was Pizza line-ups and greasy grilled cheese."}
{"text":"My first bowl of poutine and it was every bit of delicious as I imagined! I didn't like the cheese chunks, but everything else was done to perfection. I also don't mind the presence of the cheesy chunks because it enriches the taste of the poutine."}
{"text":"Order the small. The large is too big, and unless your starving, don't torture yourself. The poutine was okay, I believe I've had better and I know Toronto offers better. I did like that this place had a variety to choose from, including their sauces. I ordered the BBQ pulled pork poutine, and it was decent. The pork seem to absorb most of the BBQ sauce, so it wasn't competing with the gravy, which I liked. However, if you're touring the city for the first time, this wouldn't be my first stop for food -- unless you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"The loaded poutine is very good. It has huge strips of bacon and the flavor profiles are on point. I would suggest a non local to try this place for sure."}
{"text":"This place has by far the best poutine in the city.  It's my regular go to place for a poutine fix, however I do need to mention it's inconsistency over the years.  Most of the time it's an orgasmic experience, but a few times it's an average poutine experience for my taste buds.  Lately the place has been serving better product lately and so I'm thrilled and excited about the place again.  The layered poutine is the only way to go to experience the delights of Toronto's best poutine."}
{"text":"dude!  here in the u.s. of a. we call this gravy cheese fries.  It was so good!  I had pulled pork added, then smothered it in sriracha.  Service was good, the people watching was great.  The cook came out and danced with the cashier, that was fun to watch.  Price was right, place was clean."}
{"text":"Similar to some of the other reviewers, the poutine was just that.  Nothing special that will entice me to travel back to this location.

I found the workers to be quite helpful in assisting which poutine I should try for my first time here.  But it was the combination of gravy&cheese-to-potato ratio that fell short by a long shot.  There were a lot of fries that lacked the cheese or gravy because our order simply lacked the cheese and gravy to appropriately be distributed amongst the container.

It's not a bad place - if you're dying for poutine and you can't walk any further and you happen to be in front of this place, then go for it.  But in conclusion, nothing special."}
{"text":"You know that feeling when.. you get halfway into your poutine only to  realize your fork is no longer pulling up delicious cheesy goodness because the gravy has drenched the fries to the point where's it's just a suction of DOOM? Not at Poutini's.

The fries were super POTATO-Y (don't underestimate how important that is!); held shape & crunch even halfway through. There was just enough gravy to coat -- though almost too little; the very very bottom fries I found absolutely void of gravy.

For the hardcore poutine fans, you won't find squeaky cheese here. But for everyone else, the cheese is a-ok.

The lack of seating is a downer, but despite however many extra calories you may burn standing while eating, I would suggest sharing the regular size (it's good to keep the heart beating!)

Poutini's traditional poutine = a solid fix for those cravings."}
{"text":"The Best poutine I've tried! The portions were more than fair, the combination of green onions, gravy, fries was mouth watering, and the spicy mayo they had was the kind of kick i wanted with something this delicious. On top of that the service was great! The staff were down to earth and i didn't have to wait long to jump into my poutine! I took this to-go and it was still great. I had \"the works\" and i recommend it. Also the BBQ pulled pork was full of flavour. Poutine anyone? Hell yeah!"}
{"text":"The best poutine in gta, and very on par with Quebec. 
If you tey it once, you'll be back again and again, like me when I get to Queen street in Toronto"}
{"text":"The funny thing about Poutini's is the only time I'm able to find it is when I'm past the point of acceptable inebriation. Like a trained dog I can sniff it out and find it with my eyes closed and my ears plugged.

Sober, or by day, I've walked past it a million times asking myself, \"now where the hell was that place?\" Last weekend was no different, hunger struck shortly before 1:30 AM and my last two tequila shots were deciding whether or not to make a comeback performance a reality. Instinctively my body went into \"OMG DON'T PUKE KRIS - Survival mode\" and before I knew it I had arrived and was placing my order.

Mmmmmm double layer regular poutine is an after bar must have!!! Sure they have pulled pork, bacon and other options (not to mention a poutine covered in maple syrup and bacon). But for this basset hound of after bar fatness food simple plain original fries with DOUBLE the cheese curds and gravy (layered) is where it's at.

Typically I order a regular which I must warn is actually the large and small is a regular - what is this backwards land? My first visit here I made this mistake on order size, and lived to tell the tale (however the unholy poop baby which decided to settle in for a 4th trimester in my lower abdomen damn near killed me). Be for warned, a double layer shot of cheese curds and gravy is natures recipe for a clogged colon.

Delicious still non the less.  

I'm usually wayyyyy too boozed to recall what I pay for this feast @ 3am but I think it's around $10. It could be $50 and I'd smile and take that beating on the chin... but the staff here are super nice and take good care of us, too much drink having self loathing colon loading patrons - thanks team!!

So if you happen to bump into me around Queen West and I seem to be staggering in a determined direction (zombie like), mumbling obscenities and 1980's song lyrics to myself - don't be alarmed. Just follow me to the after bar promised land and we'll get along just fine.

Until next time - eat curds and have fun!"}
{"text":"Best poutine in the city. I love their vegetarian one. The fries are not salty at all which I find can be a problem at other places serving poutine. It does have limited seating so I would recommend doing takeaway."}
{"text":"Poutini's is the best poutine in Toronto. Fun to go to late at night or even if you feel like something greasy in the middle of the day. I haven't tried everything on the menu but really like their layered poutine with a dip. The vegan and gluten free options are also a definite plus! I just wish that they took cards, that their delivery wasn't so expensive and that they had more locations throughout the city."}
{"text":"The person who took and made our order was unenthusiastic and looks and sounds like he's high.

THE WORKS POUTINE - Traditional Poutine + sour cream + bacon + chives.

Delicious poutine. Love that the fries were still crunchy even with the gravy. Didn't like the fact that the bacon was pre-made and was only microwaved to add as toppings."}
{"text":"Decided to wander out Queen West to finally try the vegan poutine option at Poutini's, and was quite happy. Their chips are of good quality, and the gravy's delicious - not too thick, spiced just right. Their use of Daiya vegan cheese is what makes it, though - they obviously tried a few and listened to suggestions as it's the best option for a melty delicious goo that goes right along with poutine. Nice one, Poutini wizards! Bonus points for having Boylans pop on offer.

I get the feeling that timing is everything, as a quiet Tuesday evening was just right, whereas I imagine at drunk-o'clock the place would be heaving.

3 stars would be bumped up to 4 if there were more seating, and the server didn't confuse me when I asked about the sizes and what 'layered' poutine meant. Hey, i'm foreign, i'm allowed to be clueless about such things. Overall this satisfies a craving and i'd go again, but not frequently."}
{"text":"This hip joint has a small menu but the little they do - they do it well! I loved the funny/cute little commentaries I found around the shop (I think I saw a tip box with Destiny Child's pic quoting \"can you pay my bills?\"). As I chuckled to myself quietly, I look around and notice is a quiet place. Not too many people hanging about which was great for me and my group of friends who stuck around and devoured our poutine (they got the pulled pork and I got the vegetarian option). I hear they might be opening one in NYC! 

The price is on point but you will have to pay extra for any sauces. All in all, my belly was happy!"}
{"text":"I have nothing to complain about. Friendly service, delicious poutine, open late. Regular vegan poutine ($8.25 including tax) made me nice and full. Had a slight spice kick and wasn't overly salty. Bigger in real life than pictures make it look. There are 2 veggie options as well as gluten free, which is more than most other poutine places."}
{"text":"I cannot visit Toronto without coming to Poutini's for a big bowl of poutine.  I live in the US, and when I'm back home I literally dream of this!  This place is trendy and hip....they have tables but not always stools to sit on.
I'm a poutine purist, except for the fact that I'm vegetarian and have the vegan gravy...I still to the traditional poutine. I don't know what else to say, poutine would be my last meal if I had to pick one and it would probably be from Poutini's."}
{"text":"Last night I slayed Poutini's after leaving the Social where Phillip Jung of M.A.N.D.Y. was spinning pure unadulterated sickness. Although I was well hammered, I knew whilst eating that I was having a fantastic poutine experience, so much so that I was very much looking forward to coming into work this morning to Yelp this spot. 

To my amazement the reviews on Yelp were mostly low. So, I am here to big up this house of poutine, it definitely deserves more praise then it has gotten on Yelp. 

The most memorable aspect of the poutine experience for me was the completely cooked through/crispy fries. Nothing grinds my gears more then getting fries/poutine from establishments and they're half cooked through or soggy, I can't stand it. Turns out Poutini's deep fry their fries twice, Belgian style. The fries themselves are PEI potatoes and are hand cut daily, skin left on.  The bountiful curds are delivered every other day from local cheese producer Maple Dale Farms. The delicious traditional style gravy is made in house from roasting meat bones and vegetables for at least 8 hours, they also have vegetarian gravy available (Kat!).

So yes the poutine was bang on, and this is coming from a dude who regularly slays poutine and went poutine hunting in Montreal. I read a lot of comments that the poutine is too salty but I have to disagree. I wouldn't say it isn't salty, but it's poutine, it's fries and gravy, it's supposed to be salty!  I found it seasoned well and I had mad bacon added to mine, their portion of bacon was notably generous. Another fantastic option they have available is the \"layered\" option. Instead of just dumping the cheese and gravy on top of the fries, they give u the option to have curds riddled throughout the fries, amazing. 

Aside from dishing out a solid folking poutine, Poutini's is extremely green friendly. Their containers, utensils, napkins, straws and dipping containers are all biodegradable. Overall a great poutine experience for me.  Unfortunately last night in my state I was unable to read the fine print where they had their dipping sauces listed, I will be sure to try the roasted garlic mayo on my next visit.  

Think I'm chirping? Now magazine declared Poutini's Toronto's Best poutinerie, and Sean Kelly Keenan (poutine connoisseur) of Eyeweekly.com claims they make perfect poutine.  

Nuff said."}
{"text":"Again... another Poutine place I got to try while out and about in Toronto. 

I had the pulled pork and the another one that had sour cream and bacon in it... not sure the name but it was pretty bomb.

I wish they had something like this in LA. Like... as a foodie truck or something.

LOVE IT! So goood.... :)"}
{"text":"If you are ever in this area or in Canada by any chance, you HAVE to stop somewhere to try some poutine! 
A poutine is basically fries drenched in gravyand some sprinkles of curds? And it can come with other goodies on top. 
This place is a perfect place to try it because that's basically they're whole menu. Plus, they are very generous with their servings. A large can be split up by my 2 friends and me."}
{"text":"Good gravy. Much better than smokes"}
{"text":"Waking down the street drunk on a Saturday night in Toronto at 2 am after the bars hungry.... stopped a local and asked for food. He says, \"go there, have some Poutine\". WHAT IN THE WORLD IS POUTINE? At first I thought he said Protein lol 
My husband and I traveled to Canada on Vacation and this was very new to us! We must try it!! Walked in there and didn't know what to order. So the guy that works there told us what it is... how can I simply put this?!?! 
It's FU**ING HEAVEN!! Best thing invented since sliced bread. I mean why don't we have his in the us!!?!! Ok, I know you can get it here and there but it's not the same, Canadians make way better poutine, obviously it's a Canadian thing. It's a cup filled with gods best creations! Fries, cheese curds and gravy! Oh boy!! Must try!!!!! Perfect comfort food."}
{"text":"Ok while visiting from the states we decided to try a local dish..so we ordered the basic Poutin at Poutini..first, music is ridiculously loud but goes with the vibe of the overall place...the taste well it sucked....we had three bites and threw it out....its nor for everyone but I would say try it and see if you like it....its definitely a local fav."}
{"text":"This place is great. Much better than the other place. I only get the fries with the vegetarian gravy every time I'm there. I"}
{"text":"Poutine is like my own personal crack as I can't get enough of it and I know it's super bad for me.  I guess it all started when I was a kid in Montreal and my mom decided to shove a spoonful of fries, cheese and gravy in my mouth.  From that point on I was addicted. 

I had high expectations for this place as any poutine connoisseur would.  I don't usually compare any poutine to Montreal though, as their poutine is just simply on another level.  Like your eyes light up and you start salivating from your mouth day dreaming about dat knowmsayin?

First thing is, their fries are on point here.  Crispy hand cut and fresh.  I've never had a soggy poutine here, which leaves me eating the whole bowl.  The cheese curds squeak like a baby mouse taking it's first breath, that's when you know they use the good stuff.  The gravy is delicious and I would drink it with a straw if people didn't judge me.  Finally the toppings are gut bustingly good.  Slow cooked chicken and green peas?  Is I in heavens? 

If you want great poutine in Tdot, give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Ugh, really disappointing.  Barely any gravy and curds were rubbery on my traditional poutine. The Bad rubbery like they were old. I like my curds fresh and rubbery!  Gravy was ok flavour wise. Would have been better if there was more than one tbs of gravy  Fries were decent. 

Really underwhelming overall."}
{"text":"Came here with my girl on a cold Thursday night. It wasn't busy in there nor did it take long to get the poutine. i ordered the layered poutine because i love cheese. However i found my poutine not melted enough or warm. It didn't live to the hype that people made it out to be. It didn't taste bad but it wasn't life changing either. i still prefer a poutine from Harveys. They only take cash. Not too pricy but still not worth it to me."}
{"text":"If ur looking for a great poutine go no further. They are the king of their trade. A tad pricey but they give huge portions. I recommend pulled pork poutine for meat lovers like myself. They have a wide variety appealing to all crowds."}
{"text":"After 4 years in Australia all I wanted was authentic Canadian Poutine. Now it's possible that after 4 years I was expecting too much but I thought the Poutine didn't quite hit the mark. The gravy wasn't thick enough and although it had almost a chili flavour, I found it all a bit bland and not salty enough. Plus who takes cash only anymore? Maybe I've forgotten what it's supposed to taste like but I wouldn't go back. The staff were very nice though and they have gluten free and vegan options."}
{"text":"Just had THE BEST poutine so far in this voyageur's life! Maple bacon poutine is as Canadian as you can get, and theirs is superb! This place could be a true restaurant with a little more space & seating- sad it's not, or I'd return more often. Still, what they serve is mind-blowingly delish! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Yep, I've had better... I think the gravy is what makes or breaks my decision when it comes to a poutine. The gravy here reminds me of Smoke's Poutinerie... Again, meh. 

But great for a meal after partying at the Drake Hotel. But then again, when you've been drinking, any greasy meal could be good."}
{"text":"Poutini's is better than Smoke's Poutinerie in that at least it's not a thousand ingredients mashed together in a wet box. However, it's almost on the other end of the spectrum: there are too little ingredients/toppings.

The vegan poutine is kind of depressing in that it only has vegan gravy and vegan cheese. It tastes fine, but as a non-vegan, I feel like it furthers the stereotype that vegans can't eat anything. It's a bit too plain; they could've thrown on some chives or other vegetables. They have the \"Roasted Mushroom + Onion Poutine,\" but there are many more options. Price-wise, I felt like it should've been a bigger portion for $8.25 (large). 

The bacon poutine was far better.

Poutini's is not bad, but it's just okay."}
{"text":"First experience with the famed dish, and was in heaven with the bacon variation. Clean, simple atmosphere and focus was on the quality of food. Has good vibe for being second location. Glad I walked and burned the calories for the well fried potatoes, just right curds and tasty gravy! But I'm telling you, the bacon made it great!"}
{"text":"Checked out Poutini this Saturday after a haircut around the corner. I was famished, but controlled myself and only ordered a tiny traditional poutine.  I quite like it, the gravy is tasty, and most importantly, not too salty like Smoke's.  The fries are good too. For now, it satisfied my craving for poutine away from Quebec, but still not the same."}
{"text":"Worst poutine I've ever eaten to be honest - it made me and my friends sick. the gravy seemed like it was packaged powdered gravy and it was lukewarm, fries were undercooked or too dry and salty for the amount of gravy. The gravy wasn't hot enough to melt the curds. You can get better poutine at Swiss chalet even...."}
{"text":"Ahhh... Poutini's. I wanted to love you, but I just can't.

After trying Poutini's last night, I thought this would've been my new drunken spot in Parkdale, but it turns out that I was terribly wrong. There were a couple things wrong with this place, and it wasn't just the food- it was the overall experience.

I ordered the traditional poutine which is your run-of-the-mill fries with gravy and cheese curds. There were a couple of things wrong with it. First off, the fries were a bit too salty and with a poutine having gravy and cheese on it, the salt content can get quite overwhelming. I found myself begging for water after finishing my meal. Now, I love cheese, but what I love even more is gooey, stringy cheese. At Poutini's, the gravy doesn't seem hot enough to melt the cheese, which is pretty disappointing. The cheese curds just sit there as curds... not melted little blobs :(

To top off my so-so night at Poutini's, the people who worked there seemed to have a case of teenage angst. The girl that served me at the counter was like the 15 year old kid that cashes you out at the grocery store, who looks miserable and absolutely hates their life and just can't crack a smile... except the woman at Poutini's looked to be almost 30. The same goes for the guy that was making the fries. Maybe they'll grow up... or not? Silly hipsters tehehehe

Anyways, I probably won't be back unless I'm that desperate for carbs after a night out. I'm sure there are plenty of other place in Parkdale that deserve my $$$."}
{"text":"Methinks the cheese is not the real curd

While the absolute favourite after a night out @ the Social nextdoor, it really is the only place to go for after bar eats.  It has good gravy and fries- but so do other places.
I've comehere on three occassions and wished it were the poutine place on adelaide & university.

why it ain't all that:
the curds- not REAL- i dunno what it is but it doesn't melt.  it's an unmelty curd that isn't sharp or salty and doesn't \"hit the spot\"
 and the meat toppings.  I've had the pulled pork and others and they just are not good.  the MEAT taste like nothing.  It's like they didnt' stew it for long enough and it reallly just is tasteless meat with tasty meat gravey on top.  The other poutine places have the meat infused with the gravy and it tastes delish- this place not so much.

the only redeeming quality?  they play kickass music and the brown dude behind the counter is adorable in plaid."}
{"text":"Poutini's poutine is not for the poutine novice. This is not cheapo Smokes, and so if you're looking for a drunken poutine move along. 

The basics are there. The fries are twice-fried, like the belgians do, and the cheese is as good as you can get in Ontario (unpasteurized curds is hard to find). The gravy, homemade, is powerhaps overpowering though and I had a hard time tasting the saltiness and flavor from the cheese. If you appreciate the gravy it's great. And I love the detail and effort they put in their one dish. 

So why not more love? Calling this place hipster is close but not quite right, but it's more like your one friend that fries just a little too hard. From the attitude of the clerk who first ignores you, then doesn't talk to you or even tell you that your order is ready. Got it, you got more important things to do. Your utensils are biodegrable. Your smoked-meat is house-cured. Your seats are wood pieces. You're cool. I just couldn't wait to get out."}
{"text":"This poutine shop reminds me of poutine I would get in Quebec. If you are looking for something that is more authentic, don't go to Smokes and try Poutini's! I came here with a group of friends after a Saturday night out and got the Works poutine. The fries are super crispy and the gravy is light and flavourful. The cheese curds are nice and squeaky, just like how they should be. 

The menu is very basic but that is probably positively correlated with the amazing food they produce. The only reason why they didn't get 5 stars is since the place was really small so there was no orderly fashion to get to the cashier, so we waited very long just to get it. But definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"ok so the kitchen closes at 330am... why did I think it's 4am?... 
I was mad at the spot. but not going to change my rating because it's still is the best poutine place in the city!"}
{"text":"Based on the line up outside the store, I expected some top notch poutine!  

After waiting about 20 minutes to get in, I discovered a very simple menu with many different styles of poutine. I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered the basic poutine.

The fries were ok. Freshly cut and cooked well. Cheese curds...  well, you can't really mess those up! But the gravy, that's where it all went downhill. It was bland, cold and just terrible. Ruined the whole experience for me.

Better to stick to Smoke's Poutinery for Toronto's best poutine!"}
{"text":"I'm from America and I'm not quite sure what considers authentic, delicious poutine. I ordered The Bacon Poutine and my sister both ordered the traditional. And both were just ridiculously good. There is just something about the gravy and the cheese used. The orders weren't too sweet and not too salty. It was just right. 

I would highly recommend! I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night at around 8:30. This is a casual spot with a lot of high chairs. 

They were out of their onions and mushrooms!! I had to settle for the traditional poutine with layered cheese curds. Honestly not the best poutine place out there. The taste of the poutine was okay.. not the best I've had. Please stock up on your vegetables especially on a weekend night!"}
{"text":"I will take a healthy serving of Poutini's House of Pountine over a box of Smoke's any day... here's why:

- Not a chain (all about supporting local businesses)
- The cheese curds actually melt properly which leads to my next point
- The gravy is piping hot (so much so that by the time we were back in Scarborough, it was still warm)
- The pulled pork is actually tender and not all dried out

The wait is equally as long but you can taste the difference.  Definitely my go-to place in Queen West! Totally loving the environmentally-friendly utensils and poutine containers too! 

Con: CASH only."}
{"text":"So, I went to Poutini's this week because a) I was really hungry having skipped lunch and b) because my first few visits were decent enough as a viable Poutine option on Queen West. The owners were courteous and willing to mix in the gravy and cheese and well there was a hope that despite a weak gravy and a heavy price tag eventually they would hit the magic ratio of gravy, spuds and curds in each bucket-poutine synergy if you will. But then something peeved me on my last visit: \"$7.97 layered poutine.\" Yikes. So now basically you gotta pony up an extra $2 after tax if you want your gravy and curd mixed in or for the regular $7 you can enjoy dry fries on the bottom. As for the Poutine itself, fries are still great, cheese curds are too thick and don't melt properly, gravy is still much better of Smoke's but could use some more kick. An incomplete and pricey poutine still."}
{"text":"Yummy poutine. The fries are just the right size and fried to perfection.  I enjoyed the gravy it wasn't too thick or gummy and coated the fries nicely.  We opted for onions and mushrooms the toppings were generous and fresh.  Next time I will order the bacon topped one.  Service was fast and friendly we will return."}
{"text":"Being an American, my experience with poutine is quite limited, so whenever I come to Canada I always make it a mission to try poutine at least once. This time, my date and I stumbled upon Poutini's. I ordered the Works Poutine while my date got the Bacon Poutine (with maple syrup for that extra dose of \"eh\"). We were a little ambitious and in retrospect we should have shared one regular sized poutine, as the serving size was extremely large. For one person I would definitely recommend getting a tiny size instead of the regular size. The downside is that the place is quite small and there is very limited seating room. But overall we enjoyed our meal and would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try poutine for the first time!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this wasn't good at all. A few things were wrong: the mini was served in a bowl, creating a potato stew (not what you want). The cheese curd was too cold, and therefore blocky rather than malleable.  The gravy was good, but the fries weren't crispy enough to ward off the liquid.  Lastly, the menu was very small and bland - nothing original.  Go here if you've had a few too many drinks, not if you want a quality poutine."}
{"text":"Some of the best poutine I've had in my life. Plus the staff here are hilarious, helpful and attentive. 

I came across this place one day and decided to give it a shot. I don't get my hopes up usually because poutine places might not have the best vegetarian options. 

This place completely surprised me though! The veggie gravy is amazing, there's also a gluten free vegan gravy and a vegan cheese option! 

My personal favourite is the layered (extra cheese!!) with veggie gravy and garlic mayo. I highly recommend 

There's not much seating here but in the summer the picnic table out front can accommodate quite a few. I would say, plan on taking it to go though. 

And enjoy your poutine!"}
{"text":"Ok so I Love poutinis. I enjoy a works poutine with maple syrup there quite often. However .. tonight I went there and I got home to enjoy my poutine.. and as I get closer to the bottom I pull a hair out of my mouth that was inside a cheese curd. Gross. Super gross. Ruined it. I give 2 stars based on this bad experience. I get it was busy.. but this hair was inside the cheese. Different story. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"So delicious!!!

Probably the best poutine I've ever had....  

The fries were perfect, the gravy was yummy and did not overwhelm the fries and the curds(my favorite part) were abundant!"}
{"text":"This place does one thing and one thing only... Poutine. I come back here then and when but today I really got the feeling the place is taking customers for granted. I don't mind paying close to 10 bucks for fries with cheese but I truly expect quality and care. All I got today was mediocre quality and utter disinterest. No lie, Harvey's makes better poutine... Sad to have to update my review."}
{"text":"Ewww. Ok. Clean location, good decor. But that gravy is sweet tasting. Like sugary. I have tried it three times now, same deal. It's just not good poutine. The fries lack any discernible flavour profile, the cheese was fine, not memorable, I've never finished any of the poutines from this place, not even the pulled pork.
 But to me a good poutine is accidentally thicker shoestring fries, thick, dark gravy and cheese curds that squeak. All Cooked up in a trailer on the highway, same way I like my meth."}
{"text":"My review is very similar to that of Casey Lyn B: I am American, have rarely had poutine, and this is the only poutine place I've ever been to in Canada. It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am. If I lived in Toronto and was drunk at 2am, I would DEFINITELY seek this place out, but I also recommend it to sober tourists on a layover!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to satisfy your drunken stupor and you just so happened to be in downtown Toronto, you have to come down to Poutini's House of Poutine.

Yes, I know it probably sounds like absolute blasphemy to speak of poutine outside of Montréal because they do it best, but damn it, I hate Montréal because of their snobbish attitude but do I want their poutine. Well, I don't have to worry anymore. 

They keep this place open just long enough for your to stumble out of the nearby clubs and bars to fix your munchies quick. When you come out of the bar or whatever place is kicking you out, your eyes will be tired but your stomach will be awake. Just follow your nose and you'll find this place to be a shiny beacon of light where zombified patrons stumble in.

There's really not that much in terms of seating (well, really standing but space really) and it's a cramp space so if it's raining outside or it's cold as hell, be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors (I know I did and my cousins and I swapped stories with a couple of girls for a good 20 mins so it's not a bad thing).

I've been here a few times and pretty much tried all the different kinds of poutine they got on hand and must say that they're all good. But the one I like the most was The Works and the Bacon Poutine. Toss in a healthy dose of Sriracha and you've got a popping party in your mouth.

Oh, this place is cash only so make sure you have cash or you don't mind using the ATM (with fees) that's there but the times I've gone, the ATM was down half the time so I would just have enough cash on hand. Their menu is online and so are the prices so if you're just going to get one for yourself (and it's a generous portion) I'd say having $10 cash should get you most of what you would want as far as one poutine item goes. Otherwise, bring a few extra bucks. Or share.

Let's see... parking sucks (but you shouldn't be driving if you come here anyways) and yeah, there could be a long line.

Parking: Limited paid street parking

{"text":"I remember going here after a few beers and needed air outside the social. Got a bacon poutine and it just took the drunkenness to a more respectable level. Delicious!

The best poutine! Sober or drunk :-p"}
{"text":"Loooove me some Poutini's, even more at 3am after a night out! 
Way better than another \"popular\" late night poutine spot in the city, their fries are perfect, gravy is amazing, and cheese curds perfectly sqeuaky!! I couldn't ask for more. Love how simple the menu is, and love that they have vegan/veggie options!"}
{"text":"Service - 5, Food - 4

Came here on a Wednesday night at almost closing time after going to the Third Eye Blind Concert. A bunch of items were sold out but we still managed to get a regular (bigger) sized layered poutine (extra layer of cheese in the middle) with bacon and maple syrup on the side. Shout out to MONA for being so patient with all our questions and being hilarious. It was quiet when we arrived but a bunch of people came after us and she was still great even if there was annoying/weird guy in line. The poutine was satisfying but great service knocked the experience of the park!"}
{"text":"This place definitely gives Smoke's a run for its money. Fries were crispy, cheese curds were plentiful, and gravy was tasty. We ordered the BBQ pork poutine and the Works poutine - both were great. Loved the Eco-friendly round take out containers , which made scooping out the bottom a breeze.  A few things that would make this place better: fresh cheese curds that \"squeak\", more gravy with each order, and having Sriacha sauce available.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is touted by many as having the best poutine in Toronto, and it certainly lives up to the hype. 

Prior to going to a concert at the nearby great hall, my friend and I decided to grab a quick bite at poutinis. I ordered the regular size works poutine (bacon, sour cream and chives), this was the perfect grab and go meal. The fries were nicely fried, quite meaty and soft they soaked up the gravy quite well. The gravy had a rich flavour and was not too salty. The cheese curds were the best I have ever had, they were soft and clearly very fresh, they did not skimp on the curds. The chives added a nice sharp flavour, and the sour cream added a cool freshness and a little tang. My favourite part of the poutine was the bacon, I was expecting some bacon bits on the poutine but instead I was given a few large strips of perfectly crispy bacon. I do know what they did to make the bacon so crispy without shrinking it or burning it but it was absolute perfection; it put my poutine over the top (next time can I get bacon instead of fries?). 

The regular size poutine was a fair size, not huge but big enough to fill me up (the small size would make a great snack). At over $10 after taxes I though it was a bit steep but the quality of the poutine was certainly worth it. The place itself is small, mostly wood finishing with a few tables to stand and eat (my friend and I ate on the bench outside), it is definitely a take out place and takes cash only. The menu is straight forward, just a few choices of poutine (pulled pork, bacon, the works, vegan or classic), or plain fries with your choice of dip. This place is great if you want a quick bite or are in need of some drunk food. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Everyone tells me this is the best poutine in Toronto. It's pretty good! Just the cheese curds were still cold last time I went because the gravy wasnt hot enough."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?? I've been 3 times, the first 2 times were great. Hot crispy fries, hot gravy and plenty of cheese curds.

After the last time, I don't think I will go back. The fries were mealy, not appetizing at all. Maybe they were from the day before? The soggy bacon was microwaved. the only thing that made it edible was the gravy. We were really disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good poutine.  Always a mystery how any place can get fries, curds and gravy so wrong.  Thankfully, Poutini's is all kinds of right.

Fries are competently done (not the best in the city, but definitely good), curds are great and squeaky, and the gravy, arguably the most important part of any poutine, is heads and shoulders above other unfathomably popular [cough...Smoke's...cough...cough] purveyors of poutine in the city.

Haven't dabbled with too many variations yet, but the basic and the Works are pretty darn awesome.  Just get the large, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Ever since I discovered this place couple of years ago, I refuse to eat poutine anywhere else. Fries are made fresh for every order no matter how small. They have some funky dips. Few different types of gravy and staff is mostly friendly. 

If you like french fries, just go there and you'll find some sort of a fun combination that will float your boat.

This poutine is Perfect for for after drinking, sunny afternoons, cold days, rainy days, snowy days."}
{"text":"Poutine with bacon and extra cheese. That's what I ordered and that's what I devoured. At one point, about halfway through my container, I looked over at the people I was eating with and proclaimed that I was full, but I.just.couldn't.stop.eating.all.the.poutine!

It's a pretty casual place, cash only, but there is a banking machine inside if you need it and they get your food to you fast. I hear it's a great late-night spot, albeit a bit crowded, but if you go around 5 pm there's nary a person around and you can get your poutine fix fast. And, that, I'm a fan of."}
{"text":"It's french fries...it's gravy...it's cheese curds and it's open after the bars close.

Besides the fact that the next morning might feel like a civil war in your stomach this American doesn't really see how Poutini's hasn't broken the 3 star barrier. 

I guess some Canadien yelpers are just loonie ;-)"}
{"text":"This place relies on drunk folk who don't know better. We ordered the regular sized traditional poutine (beef gravy)-  The cheese curds were tasty; the poutine could have had more cheese though. The gravy was also pretty good. Now to the fries- all I could taste was salt. I regretted not buying a few water bottles as well. This place is hardly worth the $8 that they charge for a regular sized traditional poutine. 

Meh.

Good for: post-drinking food (if you're the DD of the group, just watch your friends eat)"}
{"text":"I love Poutini's poutines! Their portions are pretty big - I always get the large size and split with a friend. The smaller sizes also have reasonable prices if you prefer to eat alone. The fries are always crisp and fresh with a good amount of cheese curds. I usually just order the classic style poutine, but this place has many unique flavours if you're into more than just the average cheese and gravy. It's also open late which is perfect for the area that it's in! Great fast food restaurant for a quick bite after a night at the bar/club."}
{"text":"I suffer from a gluten sensitivity, and I am also vegetarian. Fries are also one of my favourite comfort foods (okay let's be real - foods in general), and thus my heart breaks whenever I hear about or see people eating delicious poutine goodness (and my tummy aches for days when I secretly indulge at Sneaky Dee's in poutine during drunken blackouts). So, upon hearing that Poutini's had GLUTEN-FREE VEGAN graving, I was jumping at the opportunity to try it. 

I have walked by Poutini's a few times late at night and it always looks insane, and I concur with the other reviews that it's chock-full of girls much younger than me who look twice my age in teeny dresses, and guys with armbands tattoos (sorry if any of you have those). And that picture is not my idea of a good time. But the other day when I was very hungover and feeling very blue, my friend treated me to Poutini's and we both got to experience it for the first time.

It's a small, cutely decorated place with fun music. The three employees working were extremely helpful and kind in regards to my inquiries about the gluten-free, vegan gravy. Most of the time, people either a) don't know what I'm talking about b) don't give a shit or c) become aggravated with me despite my trying to be polite. But the guys at the counter helped me out, and even warned me that the gluten-free gravy was kind of spicy (they wanted to make sure I was okay with that). They apologized saying that the gluten-free gravy would take a little longer., but in no time at all, my poutine was up. I would hardly call five minutes a long time, and I thought it was nice they let me know beforehand, just in case.

The gravy was burning hot (which I love, I think hot, fresh food should actually be hot and not cooled down as if it's been sitting there for eons), there are ketchup bottles all over the place so I was able to partake in my serious ketchup addiction to my heart's content, and the place was quiet enough for my friend and I to take the only two chairs in there to sit on. 

The employees even asked me how the poutine was, they were curious as they hadn't tried it themselves and wanted to ensure I liked it. It had a bit of a kick to it, but was not too spicy at all. They talked to me for a bit and then let me continue eating. I thought it was really cool they checked up on me to see how I liked it.

The only things I didn't like about my experience at Poutini's was the fact that there were only two chairs, and there is no washroom. As the owner of the world's smallest bladder, the latter was cause for concern.

I will definitely be back for more hangover, sad day food!"}
{"text":"Some say this spot is for tourist, but some locals say it's their favorite. It is definitly not gourmet, but for some basic cheap and easy (the way poutine was meant to be) this spot is awesome. Better gravy than most other non gourmet spots."}
{"text":"I tried the layered poutine twice and it wasnt bad. The gravy has a dash of curry in it, I believe and the service is hit & miss.  Its pretty busy in there too. 

It might have been a bit too salty too."}
{"text":"After a night of partying up with the hubby, this place is conveniently located right next to all these awesome night clubs and bars and conveniently open super late when all the drunk party goers are stumbling up and down the streets in search of food. Dancing the night away definitely makes you want to gain those lost calories back. What better way then to grub on some awesome poutine. They make poutine just the way I like it, simple and no frills. 

The negative is there are no seats. So we sat out on the dirty front step of a closed shop next door and ate our poutine as we were people watching. Makes for good fun especially in the wee hours of the night.

This is a definite late night stop for any party-goer.

I can get my poutine fix without having to travel 6 hours to get it!! WOOT WOOT!"}
{"text":"With a name like Poutini I would expect nothing but the best.. 

Passed by in search of late night eats only to discover this place - which I had bookmarked as a place to visit!

Ordered the classic to find that it was alright, nothing special to be completely honest.  

Gravy held much to be desired.  Cheese curds and fries were ok for what it was all in all.

Not dying to go back."}
{"text":"I'm glad I got to sample this piece of Canadian cuisine on my little jaunt to Toronto.

I stayed on the Harbourfront, so this place was a couple of kilometers away.  Also, quite a few millimeters of rain were falling at the time; this didn't stop me from making it over here though.  This place is in the centre of what can possibly be described as something akin to the Wicker Park neighbourhood in Chicago.

I like that the gravy did not dominate the poutine, as the fries stayed crunchy with just enough gravy to appease.  I realize poutine is supposed to be a heaping mess of gravy and melted fries, but I enjoy the fact that the fries keep their shape amidst the gravy. The cheese curds were pretty tasty.

Not a ton of seating here, but this place is more of a quickstop, carry-out and eat it on the street type of place. Good choice for drunk food. Also, Poutini's has a righteous playlist going, you won't boogie to Nickelback in here."}
{"text":"Amazing poutine. I had a 23 hour layover in Toronto after being in Japan. I knew it all be worth it if I could find really good poutine and this place came highly recommended. I got The Works based off of the recommendation from the guy who was working the counter.  It's poutine with bacon sour cream and chives. There is two different sizes you can get here. One is called \"tiny\" and the other is called regular. The regular is 32 ounces so I went with the tiny which came to be around nine dollars. I have to say this portion was the perfect size and the works was so good. The toppings were amazing and the french fries were delicious. I would have totally gone again the next day if I had time!"}
{"text":"So the poutine here is okay...The last reviewer nailed the problem right on...way to salty. Although salty, the gravy is super tasty and they actually use cheese curds...a necessity for anything claiming to be poutine. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to get the poutine here, but if your in the area and have a hankering, give it a shot."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy Poutine.  

Very clean place. Diverse menu. Service was great.

Best place to get poutine in the Ossington strip."}
{"text":"We don't really have regular access to poutine in Chicago, so we try to get as much of it as we can when we visit Toronto.  Therefore, when we saw Poutini's, we knew we'd have to stop.

We just ordered the poutine with traditional gravy, and it was really good!  The gravy is delicious - I love a sage gravy, and I believe this was the first time I ever had it on poutine.  I just don't think there was quite enough of it for my tastes.  The fries were also delicious.  They must've been twice-fried or something because they were so crispy.  They were also really potato-y.  I can't comment too much about the cheese curds and their quality and sparsity because I try to avoid dairy, but what I did have seemed decent and sufficient.

The wait was a little long, but I guess that's what happens when the fries are fried-to-order, and service was friendly.  Overall, I'd say that this isn't a destination-type place to go eat, but I'll definitely give it another shot if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Ahh..poutine! I could eat you just about everyday, as a snack, or as a meal! :)

Every single time we come to the Toronto area, we're always craving poutine. Though it's not exactly like Montreal, it is still tasty in its own right.

Poutini's delivers on this.

We came on a Saturday afternoon, as part of our city exploration/food crawl, and Husband and I shared a tiny size of their traditional. Priced at $4.99, it was the perfect size for splitting, but you could certainly finish one on your own. What I liked about Poutini's version was not only was it served in a cup, it was wide enough for two of us to dig in simultaneously.

Once we dug in, we smiled ear to ear. The cheese curds had such a nice bounce and chew to it, and it was perfectly salty and smoky. The gravy had a smooth and runny consistency, but wasn't watered down or overly salty. The frites were fried to a nice deep golden brown, excellently crisp exterior and soft interior; my idea of a perfect fry. How they managed to create the harmonious balance of gravy to cheese curd to fry in each bite is truly astounding.

Open late (3:30am on Fridays-Saturdays!!), this is a great late night snack, but be warned, not a large space, so you either grab it to go or come with a small group.

We'll certainly be back, and try the other flavors. Dig in! :)

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"Being a Montreal transplant, I KNOW good poutine (pronounced Poo-Tin NOT Poo-Teen btw).
While Toronto has made an amazing effort to recreate the delicious goodness, generally I would rather eat sweaty socks than what this city tries to pass off as the most magical dish in the Country.  
And then along came Poutini's.  Quite possible the best place in Southern Ontario for Poutine, and so close to the Montreal \"blueprint\", that when I close my eyes I can almost hear the Franglish and smell  that intoxicating Quebecois aroma of cigarettes and Labatt 50.  
Unlike that other poutine place, Poutini's sticks with the classics (also available in vegetarian) and doesn't try and buy your love with ridiculous concoctions.  They don't need to. 
And so Poutini's House of Poutine, I salute you and Thank You for your authenticity and most importantly your awesomeness.   May the curd be with you."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cut and dry. They have about 8 options which are all derivatives of the same poutine. You order, wait a few minutes and it's ready. There's not much space to dine in. They maybe have 4 stools max, so you should definitely come prepared to either walk out with your food and eat on the sidewalk, as most people tend to do or, have them wrap it up to go. Based on the use of what appears to be blue masking tape to secure the container when you ask for it \"to go\", I am convinced that many people don't bother with this option. 

We tried the original and the bacon (with the maple syrup). They were both good. Granted this was my first time having poutine and based on the description, I was anticipating something kinda gross, but worth trying once.  My expectations were certainly exceeded and I would try it again. Not true preference between the 2 options I tried. They also had chicken and vegan options, so there is something for everyone. 

They come in 2 sizes: tiny and regular. Don't let the terms confuse you. It's kind of heavy so a \"tiny\" was sufficient for me. The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"This was our first poutine stop on our trip to Toronto, and we were unfortunately very disappointed despite coming hungry. There's a small seating area with a table along the wall, and although we were the only patrons there the eating area had half-eaten containers, dirty napkins and empty soda cans. My husband ended up having to clean the table so that we had a spot to put down our food.

We were hoping the poutine would make up for the uncleanliness and sticky table, however it sadly did not. We ordered two small poutines, one with chicken and one with pulled pork. The pulled pork poutine was flavorful and the pork was well-marinated, although the curds had no squeak to it. The chicken was unfortunately very dry and flavorless and we ended up throwing it away after a few bites (and we HATE wasting food). 

Fortunately for us, there were plenty of Smoke's Poutinerie close by, and all was well again."}
{"text":"I had a few drinks so I figured I'd try Poutini's regardless of being lactose intolerant.  The Pulled Pork Poutine was worth it, beautiful, crisply fresh fried fries, gravy with a mouth feel and tang and slow cooked pork greatness.  If only they'd combine the pulled pork and bacon poutine for a double dose of pig.  

For those American travelers with wives who read their credit card statement after a business trip, I can only wish you luck explaining this line item description is not a strip club.  Hope you give it a try even though this food item seems odd to us at first."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place after clubbing next door at EFS. It was my first time in Canada so of course, I had to try poutine.

My friends and I tried the BBQ pork poutine. It wasn't my first time trying poutine (I've had it before in NYC), but this was my first time trying it in Canada and I thought it was so much better. The gravy and cheese curds actually worked really well with the BBQ pulled pork and we finished the whole thing within minutes.

They also had other choices like maple bacon, the works (bacon, sour cream, and chives), vegan, and traditional. Good place for late-night drunk food if you're in the mood for poutine!"}
{"text":"Came here because of BlogTO's recommendation.  It didn't disappoint! 

I ordered the pulled pork poutine and my SO ordered a traditional poutine.  Pricewise, it was above average for poutine (same prices, smaller portion = less value).  Service was pretty quick.  Pretty inconvenient for me on that day because they took cash only though.

The pulled pork tasted great, good texture and I was able to have some pork with each bite.  The traditional tasted pretty good as well.  Overall it's a great poutine place, slightly pricey though.  4/5."}
{"text":"Was here last night. Really good poutine. Crunchy fries, and just a whole lot of melted goodness.

Smoked Meat Poutine ($7.15 for a tiny) which is just enough for a snack.
Love it! I can do without the smoked meat though. 

Only thing I can say was that the kitchen smelled like weed more than the entrance doors leading to the outside."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago for a quick bite and boy was I pleased we went. We got a large \"The Works\" poutine to share between 2 people and were very satisfied. The fries were crispy and didn't get soggy at all despite the heeping mound of toppings. 

I wish the portions were a little larger for the price however the gravy that was used was very rich and made up for the smaller than I expected portion. I definitely will be back whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"This was yummy. A bit salty and cold but yummy. I'd say make it a bit warmer and I'll come back!"}
{"text":"If you live in Southern California, The Kroft at the Anaheim Packing District is the equivalent to this place. 
BASICALLY I loved this place. THEY ARE CASH ONLY. Love the fact that they have vegan and vegetarian options. I got the layered one, but I don't think it had much more cheese than the original. They have free water cups if you get thirsty.

Would go again."}
{"text":"Great little place that's open late. I've tried all of their different menu items, they are all amazing. My personal favorite is 'The Works'. I think it captures the perfect balance of a poutine paired with sour cream, one of my favorite ingredients. Although their bacon poutine I would say is the most popular. They have an unlimited supply of Sriracha hot sauce around for you, which compliments the poutine greatly. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're drunk, obviously you're gonna stop by here before ending your night. It's conveniently located around all the clubs and bars on King Street. Really chill staff and fast service. My boyfriend and I shared a medium mushroom and onion poutine. WOW, i wasn't even heavily intoxicated so trust me when I say this was a bang for the buck! Almost couldn't finish it, but how could we waste the cheese curds?? Really good poutine spot in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Had\" the works\" poutine. Was the best poutine I've ever had. Delicious. Not as filling as smokes poutine but way better quality."}
{"text":"Every time we come here, I make the same comment to my fiancee: \"man, I wish there were a Poutini's closer to our place\". To which she replies: \"No, you don't\".

She is, of course, correct. If Poutini's had more locations, especially one near my home or work, I'd almost certainly be up at least thirty pounds and down several years in life expectancy. I'd be sneaking out of the house at midnight to grab it and clog my arteries on at least a weekly basis.

I was never a fan of poutine before stepping foot in Poutini's (heresy for a Canadian, I know) but they've converted me. The stuff is delicious. Being a vegetarian, I'm a bit limited in poutine consumption but I have tried a few veggie places since and none of them top Poutini's. The fresh cut fries, the tasty gravy and the incredibly yummy, super-squeaky cheese curd...love it. Plus the fact that they have options for me (vegetarian) and the missus (dairy and gluten free but with bacon on top!) is amazing. The service is always friendly AND they have Sriracha on every table...the perfect accompaniment to poutine, in my opinion!

As a final tip: drag yourself in on New Year's Day if you're at all able to. The once-a-year \"Poutini Florentini\" is unreal. I wish it were a regular item but I'll have to just look forward to it every January 1st!"}
{"text":"The only place I would eat Poutine!! 
It never disappoints. First off, I love the people that work there. They always seem to be having fun. Music is blasting & they sing! LOVE the energy.

Now on to the Poutine- my bf was actually the person who introduced me Poutinis and now I cant get enough.
I always get \"The Works\" made with fresh fries ( and no matter what time of day, the fries taste fresh!), Cheese curds (i recommend to get them layered), bacon (the real meat), Sour Cream, and Chives. We like to top it off with Siracha and it is Heaven!!! 
He knows to give me the rest! I am not a fan of Poutine and this is the only place I would go to. 
Cant wait to go again! :)"}
{"text":"Allow me to preface this post with the comment that I do consider myself a slight poutine freak. I love the stuff and make an effort to try all the good ones that pop up. I like it in all forms, simple with just cheese and gravy, and complicated with veggies and whatever form of pulled meat seems to be popular. 

So it is fair to say I have eaten a few in my life and really I have to say that I wasn't very impressed with the poutine here. I found it bland. It's pretty hard to make one of the worlds saltiest foods bland too. There are a couple variants on the menu, nothing  to write home about except for the gluten free gravy for any people requiring or liking the non-gluten life. 

I have tried it a couple times as I really wanted to like it as I know how much everyone seems to but I'm sorry. The cheese/poutine had zero flavour. Given the choice I would just go home and skip the tipsy poutine. 

BIG CON - They don't take cards and the cash machine, which can be out of order, is expensive."}
{"text":"Perfect location to satisfy those pouting cravings after a night out; I'm glad they opened up the location on King West. 

Space inside is small so it's more of a grab-and-go. They also have an option for vegans (daiya) and gluten-free (gravy)."}
{"text":"Poutini's is in the middle of hipster area and serves very hipster poutine.    This isn't bad thing, I'm just stating facts.  :-)    

It's not the kind of poutine I would get in Quebec or Montreal....but it still has crispy fries, a decent gravy, and the cheese is squeaky.   The mini is quite a good portion for me, though for $2 more you can get the large and it's HUGE.  It looks like 2000 calories in a small child bucket for a sandbox, and I would probably get that if I'm in the area and hungry.   I do love my fries, my gravy and squeaky cheese.

As for poutine in Toronto, I still prefer Smokes Poutine, but that's not around Queen West."}
{"text":"Unlike smokes poutine, this place know how to make an awesome, unique bowl of heaven.  Try the works, or the pulled pork... Or the bacon... Or just Try all of them."}
{"text":"When my partner and I saw that a restaurant entirely devoted to Poutine was soon to open in our neighbourhood, our concern quickly focused on our need to purchase more pants with draw strings or elastic waistbands.  We envisioned a day where we would sit side-by-side on our rooftop patio, beer in hand, engaged in a fork-fight over a trough of gooey cheese curds covering a mound of greasy french fries drenched in aromatic gravy.  We salivated.  Our dream brought us to places with a wide variety of gravies, countless options for cheese curds and maybe even a dish involving sweet potato fries.  After all, a 'house' of poutine suggested exploration; different rooms, nooks to peek in, crannies to uncover and drawers to open to find surprising contents.  We imagined our narrow-minded vision of poutine would be blown apart with creative concoctions of flavour. We wanted sauteed mushrooms to be involved in whatever capacity they could. 

Needless to say, we had not adequately managed our expectations.  We walked into Poutini soon after it opened to find only limited options. Veggie or meat. Fries or baked potato.  No variety of cheese curds.  This was not the house we expected, more like a bachelor apartment of poutine. 

Blame cannot be attributed to the owners of this establishment.  Our vision is not theirs.  However, I think it reasonable for the average passer-by to expect that a joint focused only on poutine would try pushing the boundaries of the genre.

At the end of the day, the poutine was good. It was not the best, but it was good.  The staff was nice.  There is nothing to complain about, aside of a deep sense that this restaurant has not yet met its potential.  My partner and I look forward to the future.  We dream of a day in which our now-nine-month-old son will see fries of all shapes and colours, curds of all textures and flavours and gravies from a variety of different animals or vegetable sources come together in an environmentally-conscious bucket of poutine greatness."}
{"text":"Poutini's is the epitome of hipster poutine in Toronto. Don't be surprised if you find the hipster staff (and this place is fuckin hip-sta!) rocking out to ghetto-blasted early 2000s techno or whatever it is kids listen to these days.

Yes it's nice to know they open incredibly late on weekends to serve hungover Queen West hipsters way past last call. There are a couple bar-height tables for eat-ins. Stereotypical hipster reclaimed wood and exposed brick interior aesthetics reek everywhere.

I've heard of fast casual, but even in drunken midnight I was surprised this trendy poutinerie gets their food done at a fast food fast pace. Like, not even a minute after paying, I was chowing down my order.

The Bacon poutine--with an dose of maple syrup for extra $$--wasn't much of comfort food. It was basically a lazy poutine with chunks of cut bacon strips stacked on top, with hardly any of the maple taste detectable. The gravy was very watery, like I could drink it with a thin straw if I wanted to. To continue the theme of fast-food-fast, the last time I was disappointed by the watered-down gravy of a poutine was when I decided to try the McDonald's iteration of the dish.

Their BBQ Pulled Pork poutine was slightly better. It made me feel like I was eating BBQ flavoured chips, because it tasted a lot like it.

Overall, my east end arse is not impressed by this highly raved about poutine shop. I prefer Smoke's, thanks."}
{"text":"Let's first get this out of the way... I'm a huge fan of Smoke's Poutine, but one of my good friends raves about this place so I'm willing to give it a chance!

I have visited a few years ago but don't really recall how it went, so here's a brand spanking new review.

I got 'the works' poutine which looked and tasted pretty good.
It came with bacon, sour cream, chives... The works! Lol

The poutines here a little on the plain side to be honest. I wasn't a huge fan of the spicy gravy that my friend says is the standard gravy at this place. I'm not huge on spice to begin with, so that could be a contributing factor.

The service was great, the restaurant is a cute little dining establishment however small.
There are two small tables you can stand at.. No seating available. Cash only and no washrooms.

I definitely prefer smoke's however as my friend says if you want a poutine with lot's of \"stuff\" in it, go to Smokes. If you want a basic poutine go to Poutini's!"}
{"text":"My journey of Poutine enlightenment continues in the wake of the announcement of Smoke's Poutine on wheels. I've decided to persevere to see if I can finally developed an acquired love for this food. I made my return visit to Poutini's since I was in the neighbourhood and it was 1:15 p.m. I figured this was as good a time as any to give Poutini's another shot at making me feel the Poutine amore. 

Alright, so here's my own personal low down as to why Poutini's isn't doing it for me. The gravy just isn't hot enough. It's thick, almost too thick and it just doesn't seem to make those cheese curds get ooey gooey the way I want them too. Speaking of those cheese curds, I think I prefer them smaller as opposed to curds the size of my fingers. I want them more crumbled so that they can fall down in between the crevices of the french fries. Seven bucks for Poutine that made me go \"meh\". 

Ok, on to Smoke's Poutine as my quest continues."}
{"text":"Absolutely gross. At least 8 massive cobwebs with massive spiders greet you on the way in. I happen to not notice when I ordered. I can't believe this place is still in business. Total disbelief. Poutineries was super salty.... Go elsewhere!!!"}
{"text":"I started eating here when I stumbled upon this location 3 years ago when out for a walk. I HAD to have the Pulled Pork. 

I never had anything this elaborate before on Poutine. It was heaven. I'd say a little less than 2/3 Fries, 1/3 big sweet chunks of Pulled Pork and then cheese and not too much gravy, so that a few fries at the bottom sides still had some crunch. Or, in other words just the right amount of everything in the right combination.

It was a great experience. I've since had the Pulled Pork 5 more times at this location and just simple poutine here once. 

This portion and prep here is very consistent and great for sitting across the street on the old post office steps and people watching on a sunny day :-)"}
{"text":"Difficult for me to review this place given that I find poutine rather unpalatable, but I'll do my best: 

Setting: clean and modern. 

Ordering and menu: simple selection and ordering technique. Staff are polite and quick. Poutine is assembled in front of you before service 

Food: what Can I say? Serving is large (there is also a small size that I probably should have gone for) chips were crisp, gravy was warm and relatively tasty. Cheese curds were inadequately melted in my opinion and bacon was overly salty. I'm sure aficionados will dispute the correct way poutine should be made but I'd take a chips and cheese and mayonnaise any day over this."}
{"text":"We stopped in here yesterday after going to Samuel J Moore's (courtesy of another fantastic yelp event).  I was in total need of something greasy and delicious.  We ordered the pulled pork poutine.  It was yummy.

French Fries, Cheese Curds, Gravy and a generous helping of pulled pork?  yes, please.  
I was one happy camper."}
{"text":"Good poutine, definitively a stop to make, gravy tasty, fries excellent and pulled pork was very good."}
{"text":"Crispy Fries? Check
Amazing curds? Tasty Tasty
Delicious Gravy? Ohh yea
Pulled Pork? Wonderfully good

Best poutine in the city. They don't offer nearly the variety of toppings you'll see at Smoke's but what they do offer is superb. The place gets packed around 2 on weekends, but they manage the line well. The only downside to this place is that they are cash only, which is just frustrating."}
{"text":"cheese curds were great

gravy wasn't enough

double fried fries were very good

a bit out of the way for most downtown core activities 

poutine was cold! wish there was more seating. 

I think this place is a bit overrated and over visited thanks to Anthony Bourdain"}
{"text":"As a Quebecer, I can tell you, this is not what an authentic poutine should taste like. There was barely any curds and the gravy was horrible. I thought I had a bad experience the first time, so I gave it a second chance and it still disappointed.  The gravy has its own type of flavor I can't put my finger on it, but make no mistake, this is definitely not what a poutine should be. As a Quebecer, makes me sad that people think this is real poutine."}
{"text":"Honestly I could give you a page long review (I can rant about nothing for a really long time as well), but to save you the trouble I was going to write the exact same things as Evelyn W. 

I absolutely love poutine. It is love, it is life covered in rich gravy and cheese curds and other amazing things that exist in this world. Poutini's offers many varieties, even a gluten free gravy which I think would appeal to a lot of customers. I've heard many great things about Poutini's and was so hyped to try it.

But why Poutini? Why does your gravy have to be so cold to me? You were so steaming hot in my mind, but so cold in person. 

They also have a bunch of cheese curds on top so you except a couple down the road as well, but it's an optical illusion. I'm being harsh... I just like hot gravy and melting cheesy deliciousness on my fries...

Their fries were alright. Actually I didn't notice much about them either. 

Also cash only to top it off. Why Poutini why."}
{"text":"The bacon in our bacon poutine was poorly microwaved. Yes it was pre-cooked before placed in the microwave but come on. We asked for it to be re-made but even after that, my preteen cousin picked out all the bacon. It was a Sunday afternoon with barely any customers so I'm a little confused as to how a microwave is involved in.
 
The star is for their pulled pork. 

Note:
1. The poutine containers are not poutine-friendly. It's a bit tall so you have to eat whatever toppings you have first before finding your way into the poutine.

2. Only 6 seats for tables that could've seated at least 12. 

See you never, Poutini."}
{"text":"Looks like I'm giving out one of my rare 5/5 scores this time, Poutini's is just that good.

The poutine truly is an amazing invention.  It's something so simple yet so coveted in our country.  Taking it's simplicity into consideration, you'd figure most places would have the formula down to a perfect science, yet I always eat poutines that just simply don't taste right.  It makes me wonder whether these restaurants are screwing up the basic poutine recipe, or if I'm just spoiled with my poutine tastes from going to places like this.  Either way, Poutini's is simply outstanding.

There are some drawbacks to this place and I might as well get them out of the way first since at the end of the day they're insignificant.  The place is fairly small with limited seating, they only accept cash and the washroom was out of service when I went.  In addition the restaurant could be touched up a bit as it wasn't exactly the prettiest sight to behold, but nothing horrible either.  These minor setbacks, however, still aren't enough to take points off that perfect score up above.

The poutine alone completely redeems any of the negative aforementioned points.  I got the regular sized \"the works\" poutine which had bacon and sour cream on it.  Everything about this poutine was outstanding.  The gravy was the perfect consistency, the cheese curds were a fantastic texture, and the bacon and sour cream went together shockingly well.  I'm assuming the fries themselves also tasted good, but it was hard to even be able to tell with so many delicious toppings covering them.  There aren't many different varieties of poutine at this place, but it didn't even matter since the one I got was so good; I would probably get the same flavor every time I come back.  The amount of food I got was also spot on, not too much to make me feel bloated and sick and not too little to leave me wanting more.  Simply perfect in every regard.  The staff was friendly and the prices were reasonable as far as gourmet poutines go.

Poutini's an outstanding place, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes poutine even the slightest bit."}
{"text":"I have had some of the best(and worst) poutines in La Belle Province and I can say that Poutini's can certainly hold their own against some of the best.

It was the summer of a few years back that I had took the plunge to recognize Poutini's at a local food event out west. I was instantly hooked! It had the flavours and refinement that reminded me of Montreal's very best.

Let's cut to the chase. The best poutines are often the ones leaving you wanting just a little more even after you're done. That means it has to satisfy your primal instincts for sugar, fat and sodium all the while keeping it simple and light. A good poutine is all about crispy hand cut fries, a complex yet light gravy to \"wet\" the fries(not immerse, not soak) and cheese curds that are...well curds and not a stringy, gooey mess. Yes, the poutine as basic as it seems can be a refined experience. The toppings are merely to dress the stars (fries, gravy and cheese) and not overwhelm.

Poutini's is succcessful in recreating this level of artistry on so many levels. The fries are fantastic. The cheese curds (shipped in daily) are amazing. The combination of toppings is limited but each delicious in it's own right. And last but not least a light and full flavour gravy. All this makes a great poutine! This isn't a poutine for the masses. It isn't 800lbs with 400 toppings smothered in a bathtub of gravy kind of poutine. This is a refine, simple yet delicious bowl of fries; the best take on a poutine from La Belle Province."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to check this place out... So much hype to live up to that it's almost impossible, but I thoroughly enjoyed the poutine. It tasted delicious and the curds had a nice squeak to them.

Apart from the food, the staff was super friendly and they even let me put up a poster for one of my events. So thumbs up all around. I like the look of the place as well. I'm trying to lose weight so poutine is not really on the horizon for me these days, but I will be back when I have a break down."}
{"text":"It has friendly staff and is located in a busy lively neighbourhood, especially Friday nights. The poutine though is not as good as described here. Listed as one of the top-ten Toronto's poutine, I expected to get an incredible meal which I would not forget the taste and makes me return there again. However, what I had last night was cold fries and curds with not-hot-enough gravy which could not melt the cheese. Even the Ginger Ale I had was not cold and apparently not coming out of the refrigerator. Three stars just for the fast and friendly staff and its late-night-hour service!"}
{"text":"Poutine. Canada's Pride and Joy. However, I wouldn't recommend getting Poutine from here. 

The reason why Poutine is so comforting is because of the combination of Potatoes, Cheese and Hot Gravy. 

I decided to for go the Fancy Options and stick with the Traditional Poutine; served with Fresh Cheese Curds and Beef Gravy. 

Boy oh Boy was I disappointed. I did't like the taste of the gravy, or the potatoes. What got to me was the lack of squeak from the cheese. Cheese curds are supposed to be squeaky, these curds were NOT. They also did not melt. 

A ski chalet has served me better poutine. 

I've had the very best of poutine from Montreal and now I've had the very worst. I would recommend going to Kitson and Co for good poutine."}
{"text":"Fries. Soggy. Sad looking. 
All of the generic tasting gravy was at the very BOTTOM of the cup .. huh?

A modest amount of teeth squeaking cheese on top.  

And the music?
WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too loud. The girl taking my order couldn't hear me, but she my read lips and I had to POINT at the size I wanted.

It was a terrible experience. 
I came out with a pounding headache. 

This place is completely over hyped.
Will never return."}
{"text":"The order through Ubereats was extremely cold - it took forever also considering i live across the street lol"}
{"text":"I was raised in an area of the country close to where Poutine grew up so consider myself well versed on what it's supposed to taste like, and let me tell you, this ain't it. 

Let's get to the point: I don't expect that all poutine has to taste like it's straight from Quebec and I don't think that places in Toronto should know as well as in La Belle Province, but for a place that has the word poutine in IT'S name, the poutine here at Poutini's is very...pedestrian. It's plain. The fries aren't that special, the curds aren't that good, and the gravy is pretty obviously powdered water gravy. The set up is nice and casual and the lacquered wooden bar tables serve to punctuate and updated version on the take out counter. The prices aren't bad. The poutine isn't even that BAD. It's just not that GOOD, and that's the problem. 

If you're around, it's not a never go to place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"A newbie to Canada, I searched for 'best poutine in Toronto' and this place showed up. It's a smallish place, no frills, and can probably seat 15. I got the pulled pork poutine and it was excellent. Not overwhelmingly flavored, just a nice balance between the meat, fries, gravy and curds. The slow cooked pork came apart super nicely too. I was fully expecting to down a ton of antacid after the meal, but the food had amazingly good quality ingredients going into it and I did not need to do that at all. Do go if you're ever in the neighborhood, or even if you aren't."}
{"text":"Everything is home made and local!  They even have a vegetarian poutine! 
Best poutine in Toronto!  You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Now, I'm not from Canada so I don't know the \"best poutines\", but I really liked Poutini's! Where I'm from, we have a version of poutine called disco fries: fries topped with beef gravy and melted mozzarella cheese. Since I've been a vegetarian for the majority of my life, I've never had disco fries before.
So, as you can imagine,  I was really excited to see that Poutini's had a vegetarian gravy. I've had vegetarian poutine one other time (in Montreal where they apparently do it best) but I was very satisfied with Poutini's poutine.
There IS a vegan option for all you vegans out there, but it's made with Daiya. I'm not a huge Daiya fan, so I passed and got the traditional with a veg gravy. The gravy and cheese were good! The fries? Eh, they weren't awful, but they weren't to die for.
All in all, I was a happy camper.

TIP: the portions are HUGE. I highly suggest you get the \"teeny weenie tiny\" poutine... which is a regular sized cup. I was completely stuffed and would never be able to finish the regular size... which is almost three times the size of the small. Trust me, your wallet (and waist line) will thank you later."}
{"text":"I tried Vegan Poutine. It was delicious! They accept cash only. I wish I could use credit card there."}
{"text":"What a place! This trendy spot on Queen St. W. is your poutine haven. They've got 6-7 different types of poutine with both beef-gravy, veg-gravy or vegan gravy. Their limit to two sizes of poutine leaves you the option of 'big' and 'bigger', if you want a small serving this isn't the place to come.

I came with a friend, she ordered the layered poutine and I ordered the traditional. I will give them credit that the extra cheese was evident in the layered but worth the extra $2? I'm not sure. I also couldn't finish my serving (which is unusual for me). 

The 'cash only' thing, didn't really bother me as I was intending on paying cash anyway. I think the biggest 'con' (or perhaps 'pro') for my friend and I was that neither one of us could tell if we had the meat or veg-gravy. We both thought it appeared too mild and almost sweet for meat gravy but in looking through the other pictures on yelp, the majority of the gravy looks the same. 

I certainly did not find the fries (or any of the components of the poutine) overly salty, in fact I felt the flavors blended nicely. I can definitely see myself returning here next time I'm craving poutine."}
{"text":"Poutini's is a poutine lovers dream.  This small location only has a few things on the menu, but they do them right.  I had the layered poutine - basically just poutine with extra cheese curds in the middle.  The fries were crispy, flavorful and well salted.  They held up well with all the cheese and gravy.  The curds were small and very fresh. They had a faint squeak and a smooth texture.  The gravy was a little more subtle, but quite nice when poured over everything.  They have a large and a tiny size.  It is about $7 CDN for a tiny order, which is more than enough for one person.  This place is pretty bare bones, so you can grab your little bucket of poutine and eat it as you walk around the neighborhood.
They are cash only and don't have public bathrooms, which isn't the most customer friendly."}
{"text":"For our first Canadian \"meal\" we stopped at Poutini's on the way to our hotel.  It was good, but not great.  Either the fries or the gravy was SUPER salty.  And not enough cheese curds.  I remember poutine being better than this."}
{"text":"I'm from Philadelphia in the States and I literally take trips to Toronto for this place. I want gallons of the vegetarian gravy because it's seriously the best stuff. The staff is always so sweet and the poutine is always bangin'. I'll always make a stop here every time I visit the city!"}
{"text":"I stopped by because I was hungry. Had the Mushroom and Onion Poutine regular size. It was a small bucket piled high....really high. It was warm and filling. The place is small. The servers were nice. All in all, good when you are ravenously hungry."}
{"text":"It's whatever. If you want yesterday's garbage then this is the place to go. The owner is outrageously disturbed."}
{"text":"I currently live in Orlando, FL USA and have noticed different restaurants serving poutine.
I wanted to try proper poutine in Canada to have a frame of reference before trying anything else,  so I came here.

Really appreciate the vegetarian and even vegan poutine option.
I opted for roasted mushroom and onion poutine and it was very comforting.
The curds squeaked when I ate it.
Very nice, I enjoyed it.

This place is definitely hipster.
The person that assisted me appeared to be high.
There was music playing that included racial slurs. . .
and no washroom available, even for paying customers. . .
(now that was a HUGE bummer)

Appreciate they accepted my US currency, as they only accept cash. There is an ATM onsite to help facilitate getting it, so no worries.

I enjoyed my poutine, but would really like to try another place that's more customer focused (like, I've been walking all day and really need the toilet).

Maybe it's time I download Air PNP"}
{"text":"Honestly the best late night snack after a night of hardcore drinking and dancing. The pulled pork poutine is a must."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of times. Really good poutine, amazing house gravy. Only limited of options to choose from. Cheese curds tasted amazing they squeaked as I was chewing fresh cheese curds"}
{"text":"Very limited seating. Cash only. No restrooms. Makes an experience difficult to enjoy. I would have given this place 3 stars if not for these inconveniences.

I don't go for any particularly wild combinations of poutine. I just like the traditional -- plain ol' fries, gravy, cheese. I find it is a bit dry here. The gravy is super thick and a bit too heavy and overpowering. The curds are decent, but pale in squeakiness compared to some other places in the city. I usually only find myself here when my vegan friend wants to go for poutine -- they have a vegan version with vegetable gravy and Daiya cheese. I've tried it, and wasn't particularly impressed either.

On a brighter note, they're pretty hip and use biodegradable food ware."}
{"text":"Never had poutine and I'm not that impressed and somewhat disappointed.  The cheese curds were cold, the gravy was okay and the fries were cooked perfectly.  But maybe it's me because everyone here seems to love this place. Now on the hunt to find another poutine place."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I do not say eh. With that said, this establishment serves up one hell of a hangover cure which they call 'Poutine'. Evidently a bunch of potatoes are cut into thin slices and then accidentally dumped into hot oil. The remaining crispy snacks are covered in salt and then assaulted with a glaze of gravy and chunks of cheese curds for good humor. The resulting delicious mistake makes for one hell of a good memory of Toronto."}
{"text":"Not bad!! Love that there is a gluten-free, vegan version of the cheese curds and gravy!!

Haven't done the poutine taste test yet with smoke's but Im excited to see which is better. However poutini's might win as they are vegan and gluten-free"}
{"text":"I'm currently visiting Toronto, and I found out about Poutini's via Yelp.

The poutine was very delicious, as it was my first time trying it. I got 2 small sizes, \"The Works\" and the BBQ pork. They were both very delicious and filling for 3 people. I would say the BBQ pork is definitely sweeter than The Works, but both are equally delicious. There is very minimal seating arrangement here, as it seems to be more of a to-go place.

Poutini's is a small hole in the wall, ran by two workers. The workers are extremely sociable and love singing while they are working. It seems like they are hanging out rather than working! and I mean that in the most positive way possible. It is a great environment to be in, and I recommend this place as a quick stop on your way home to pick up some delicious poutine."}
{"text":"It's overrated. It's good when your shitfaced, but try it stone sober. Or rather, go on a hangover. The loud music these hipster kids blast on the speakers will literally make you sweat from anxiety. But you don't eat music, or hipsters, so how about the fries? Well, there nasty, but in a good way. Like eating a handful of chocolate bars. It's fun, but it's also shit. Perhaps poutine is what it is though, just fries with clumps of cheese. Perhaps it can't be elevated. If that's the case, then gimme the works."}
{"text":"This place is over hyped .. the poutine doesn't taste  that good really .. I was expecting a lot more from this .. but the place looks pretty and they make your poutine fresh so that's a bonus ! Plus it's very clean !  And the presentation is nice ! But I would suggest tomatoes as well for the works"}
{"text":"Well it was my first test of poutine and I don't really know how it compares... However the service was fast, the place is relatively nice, I was just disappointed they run cash only in 2016 (but they had an ATM inside the shop so that was good).

Price was low for such a lot of food."}
{"text":"Eeeeeeeee!  Poutine! Poutine! Poutine!  Never have I had; always have I wanted to try it.  Poutini's is where it happened.  Now don't criticize me for having the vegan version, but that's what I ordered and it was delicious.  I added caramelized onions and mushrooms to it and that thing was perfect!!!!  I wasn't expecting it to be so soggy at the bottom but that makes sense.  

I loved it. Absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"I love this poutine place...mmmmmm so good after a sloppy night and just as good after a long stressful day, hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"went out of my way to drop by this location tonight. The were out of cheese and gravy.
REALLY. All they sell is fries with cheese and gravy and they were out of cheese and gravy, It's cash only and no washroom. Sounds like they are not interested in doing business. I'm not interested in going back."}
{"text":"As the saying goes: \"When in Rome, do as the Romans do\" so this is one of the first places I had to go in Toronto, right?! My colleague from back in California is Canadian and recommended I try Poutine on my first trip to Canada so that's what brought me to this place. 

Cheese curds and fries bathing in gravy sauce didn't sound as appealing to me initially but Poutini's opened up my eyes to this Canadian speciality. I ordered the smoked meat poutine in hopes of balancing out the carb overload and it hit the spot after an intense workout. If you're in Canada, you must try this at least once!"}
{"text":"Really good. Never had poutine before but this place was cool and quick with the food. We ordered and left bc there wasn't a lot of room to sit but overall the food was good!"}
{"text":"My visit was sometime after 2 AM on Friday night, so my taste buds were maybe not at their full stage of alert.  The service was good enough, especially considering the chaos inside the place at the time.

We shared a large pulled pork poutine ($10 plus tax I believe).  It certainly was a generous portion of pulled pork, and I definitely thought it was tasty at the time.  I agree with other reviewers comments though that the whole thing is too salty, and the gravy is not hot enough to melt the cheese curds.  

Not being a french-fry person to begin with, this is not something I would seek out, and certainly not sober.  But it does make an acceptable late-night snack before heading home."}
{"text":"I used to dream of this poutine, when I was far,far away from Toronto. I used to brag that this poutine is better than what ive eaten in Montreal.

After returning to eat here, I've been sorely disappointed. 

I ordered the regular with extra curds, curds were one long piece of chunky curds. They were delicious, but its not that hard to make sure the curds are in pieces.

Amount of gravy was lacking, I much rather go grab a poutine from a Toronto food truck. 

Gravy used to be rich full of heaven, now its just disappointing like a movie sequel.

Goodbye my love,
Ex love of HOP."}
{"text":"My first encounter with the real deal, Canadian poutine!  Often imitated, but never duplicated (I'm not sure they even have cheese curds in the UK).  My husband and I both totally \"got it\" re: the hype around poutine after this experience.  We shared a regular size Smoked Meat poutine, which is traditional poutine plus house-cured smoked meat, and oh mah goodness it was fab.  They layered it really intelligently, so you didn't have any dry fries, or bites without cheese curds.  The regular size bowl seemed small when it was just sat there empty on the counter, but once it was filled with food it seemed like a huge amount!  We couldn't finish it, although to be fair we'd been snacking throughout the day.  But it was lovely - a tad bit salty, but we loved the melty gooey cheese, the savory gravy drenching the fries, and the really outstanding and abundant smoked meat.  Would highly recommend you give this one a try rather than just the original.  Okay Canada, we understand why you love this stuff so much.

Cash only, and there are a few tables, but it's small, so you may want to take your poutine on the go!  They offered vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options, so there's poutine for all!"}
{"text":"My first time in Toronto and couldn't miss trying some poutine!  

Definitely one of those places you visit at 2 in the morning after a long night of drinking.  My friend and I shared the Regular-size BBQ Pulled Pork Poutine and it was DELICIOUS!  The perfect balance between savory from the fries and cheese and sweet from the BBQ.  

Our friends got the Traditional and the Bacon Poutine, which they didn't seem to like as much as we liked our BBQ Pulled Pork one.  I took a bite of the Traditional Poutine and it was way too salty.  The couple that got the Bacon Poutine said theirs were salty too and couldn't even finish half.  

The place is kind of small with barely any chairs.  Decor is cute, though... wooden tables and stools."}
{"text":"Oh Poutine. Not only is this located in a great part of Toronto, but it is a true poutine with crispy golden fries, a light gravy, salty curds, and added toppings of your choice. The BBQ pork with bacon was a perfect pairing. The restaurant (if you can call a small kitchen and a counter place orders a restaurant) was clean and the cook was very friendly. There's 3 bar stools inside to sit making this primarily a grab and go style. Even though poutini is traditionally a late night drunken food, House of Poutine is made with such a great quality that it can be fully enjoyed with no libations necessary."}
{"text":"Poutine was delicious, probably the best I've had. Had the classic and my gf had the the works. Portions were huge. My gf doesn't even like poutine but she really enjoyed this one. Wish they had more seats maybe some tables outside as it is a small spot. The store only accepts cash which is sometimes an inconvenience. But all and all when I crave a good poutine this is the spot I'll be heading too."}
{"text":"I ordered only the Vegan Poutine, and it was surprisingly good.  The fake cheese melted and was satisfyingly cheesy.  The gravy and fried tasted great as well."}
{"text":"This is the best vegan poutine I've had so far in the city and we're not talking about icky, dry tofu chunks. You are getting oozy, gooey, perfectly-melted gluten-free, soy-free Daiya cheese! There are two sizes - the 'tini' and the large. Of course, I go all the way - $8 is a great deal and the perfect size for stuffing your face.

Nearly every year, I make it a point to come here in the middle of Nuit Blanche when I'm roaming the city on two wheels. And although the lines are incredibly long, the staff can handle the crowds (with a smile!). Plus it definitely tastes better when you've been biking in the cold!"}
{"text":"Incredibly a hearty ass snack or meal...

I encountered this place while staying at Gladstone hotel. I never tried it before, but I was quickly converted into a believer in this 

I loved the fries, it has a good texture and taste to it. I had to come back twice to this place in my stay in Toronto. 

First time trying it, I got the pulled pork poutine. It was the heartiest snack I ever had. The blanket of pulled pork was very good,soft, and marinated along with the softly textured cheese curds. The gravy they use is a nice complement which brings all the flavors together.   

Two days later, I wanted my good bye fix of Toronto, so I went back braver than before. I ended up ordering the traditional poutine which was chives, sour cream, cheese curd, and fries.

I think this is the best item mainly because the sour cream is a little lighter than pulled pork and the cool taste of sour cream makes the cheese curd and gravy taste even better.  

Much props, and I would recommend this place for a cheap quick hearty snack or meal.. 


Serious note: Be aware you might be in a serious case of  food coma after eating this"}
{"text":"Just go to a chip wagon, its sooo much better. The only saving grace is that they have a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"When in Canada, you must have poutine.  It is like an unwritten rule!  My boyfriend and I made it a priority to visit some place that had poutine and while searching, Poutini's House of Poutine popped up.  Poutine twice in the name?  Yupp, they must sell some major poutine.  And yes they do!  

The place is small but easy to find for us tourists.  It is a cute little shop inside with about 10 poutine options.  I chose the bacon poutine (with maple syrup - def get the syrup.) Boyfriend got the pulled pork poutine.  I got the small, he got the medium.  I couldn't finish mine it was so rich and delish!  Boyfriend polished his off!  You wouldn't think fries, gravy, cheese, bacon and maple syrup would mesh, but damn, does it ever!

There are only about 4 seats in the place along the wall, next to the modest fireplace.

That staff was so nice, and even offered a few touristy things that we could do that was close by and inside (it was early Feb. and VERY cold.)

I am totally in love with this place and I kinda wish it was a chain restaurant and would establish a place in Long Island!  Bring a little Canada here!  

This place is a must people!"}
{"text":"Terrible. How is this poutine? I grew up with the real deal - Quebec poutine and this is not even close.  I was sooo dissapointed since all the rave reviews on this site. The gravy has some weird spice in it, the curds taste like hard rubber. The fries were ok. There was minimal gravy and that was just fine as it was terrible anyways. I won't be back, thanks for the automatic heartburn."}
{"text":"Of my 3 days I had spent in Canada, this was arguably the best thing I've eaten up there. This was my first time having poutine (I currently live in the states), and needless to say I would love to go back to have some more. 

I had ordered the small mushroom and onion poutine with vegetarian gravy. The gravy was the perfect consistency, the fries were not over cooked, the mushrooms and onions were sautéed and seasoned well, and the cheese curds had a perfect texture. 

For the price of their poutine, I'd definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I came in with some friends during our visit from New York after an employee at the Steam Whistle Brewery recommended it to us. I tried poutine for the first time a couple of days before coming here over in Montreal. I didn't really like it, so when I came here, I was going to order fries. At the last second, I decided to give the bbq pulled pork poutine a shot. I'm SO glad I did! It was phenomenal. Tasted so good! This place has turned me into a fan of poutine. The place was really clean too. The employees were nice and service was quick. Highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"OMG this place always hits the spot, went there the other day after a concert to grab a quick snack before the bar. They were out of smoked meat, so I had to settle for the bacon poutine. The portions are huge and loaded in. Lots of flavourful gravy and cheese curds provided. My favourite poutine spot in the city, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Poutini's has awesome options that are sure to please just about everyone who's looking for comfort food. Their vegan poutine is made with Daiya and a veggie gravy. The fries are hot and crispy, the service is prompt and they've always got fantastic music playing. The one thing I miss is a liquor license. Their poutine with a nice hoppy IPA is a perfect combination. There's rarely a wait and the place usually has a group or two."}
{"text":"Being a true Montrealer (born and raised) who just moved to this fine city, I was hit with a craving for poutine.  Not knowing anyone here, I decided to venture on my first Toronto culinary adventure.  My goal was to find a good poutine, one whose fries are nice and crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside, whose cheese is actual squeaky curds, and whose sauce is salty, thick, and velvety.  

I stumbled across POUTINIS after having done some research.  YELP, several other sites, and word of mouth all pointed to POUTINIS.  I asked myself if I just found the place that will give me some sense of familiarity in this large unfamiliar city?

Walking in, the first thing that hit me wasn't the smell of gravy, rather the sound of blaring loud music!  I overlooked this though, hoping that the poutine would make up for it.

The menu had shown me variations of poutines that I had never seen before.  Pulled pork on a poutine?  How about \"the works\"?  Seemed like everyone was ordering the works... traditional poutine + bacon + sour cream + chives.  After carefully reviewing the menu, I decided to get the \"layered\" poutine, traditional poutine with an extra layer of curd cheese in the fries.  You can't get more Montreal than that right?

So... I go to the cash and ask \"can I have a layered POUTSIN please?\" with the true Montreal pronounciation.  The sound of the word POUTEEN just makes me cringe every time I hear it.

I got my poutine and hit the stools.  The look of the poutine was not bad,  the fries were nice and golden brown. Reminded me of the type of fries that you could easily find in any \"La Belle Province\" or \"Lafleur\" across Quebec. golden brown on the outside, and fluffy on the inside.  The cheese was actual curd cheese, the type that squeeks in between your teeth with every bite.  Impressive indeed. But damn, that sauce... that's where it all went downhill for me.

The sauce reminded me a lot of the sauce that you get for the chicken at KFC.  It had that thick, almost starchy texture to it.  It didn't remind me of a poutine sauce at all.  Also, It had this nasty reddish color to it, possibly due to the ridiculous amount of chili powder that I tasted in it, or cayenne pepper.  Whatever the spice mix was that was added to the sauce, it was VERY overpowering. The only good thing about the sauce was the temperature, not piping hot but not too cold either.  Just the right temperature to start melting the curd cheese slowly. After a few bites, I didn't want to continue eating it.  But I took the courage to mix it all up into one mishmash of fries, cheese, and poutine \"sauce\" and forced myself to gulp it down. 

The only reason why I am giving this place two stars as opposed to one is because they nailed it on the fries and the cheese.

Ths poutine might be good if you are a Torontonian who has never tried a real poutine, but if you come from La Belle Province like me, expect to be seriously disappointed."}
{"text":"Super tasty! Open late hours for your midnight cravings. Solid cheese to gravy ratio. Staff is friendly.  Wait times are very short. Give us more vegan options, please!"}
{"text":"Great poutines and very generous portions. I shared a large with someone and it was more than enough. They have both traditional poutines and may other variations. Prices are reasonable considering its prime location in downtown toronto. 

We got The Works, which has gravy, cheese curds, sour cream, bacon, and chives. It was super rich, but super delicious, especially if you had a few drinks. Don't think of the calories. While very good, I was reaching for ketchup at the end to cut the richness. 

Place was generally pretty clean, but not much eating space. Theres about 3 stools and a fireplace that you can use as a ledge. But i'm sure this was by design.. to keep the drunks at 2am out on the streets instead of inside."}
{"text":"I went a bit poutine crazy for a month and was determined to try as many as I could. My previous favourite had been Jackastor's many poutine dishes and though I know it's probably not authentic it sure is delicious. I also tried Smokes Poutinerie during one weekend in Waterloo and I have to admit, Poutini's is way better. The gravy was good but not too salty and the cheese was great as well on my original style poutine. However, the container made it hard for the gravy to \"flow\" to the bottom so the bottom layer of fries was well...just fries. The spicy mayo was yummy and accompanied the poutine well. Way better than Smoke's transparent gravy and cardboard fries for sure! 
I like the decor of the place, kind of \"hipster\" I guess but the seats/tree stumps weren't that comfortable. The location is a bit out of the area for me and price seems a bit higher than what I would like to pay so I'm unsure if I would ever return."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Poutini's at 3:30am tonight.  I had a small poutine with veggie gravy.  It was good, but not great.

They seem to make their fries super hot, in hopes that they will melt the cheese curds, but it just doesn't work.  The gravy should be steaming so that it melts the curds as it's poured on.  Also, I found the veggie gravy to be a bit too salty, but the flavour was alright.

The best part were the cheese curds.  Great quality.  I'm hoping it might teach a few other venues in our city to use a higher quality cheese on their poutines.  

As far as the whole experience, the restaurant was really dirty.  Flyers all over the floor, overflowing garbage bins, stacks of empty poutine containers everywhere, dirty tables, and only two mis-matched stools for sitting.  It made me think it was almost done as a strategy to keep late-night drunk diners from sticking around after last call.  In further support of my theory, they were blasting music so loud I could barely have a conversation.  They also should consider being open later.  Most people leave the bars at 2:30/2:45am, and with Poutini's closing at 3:30am, there's barely enough time.  As a bartender, I went in sober, after my shift, but I think they would get a lot more service industry from the area if they extended their hours.  That being said, we left Poutini's close to 4am, and they had just served another group of party-people.

The main thing that will keep me from choosing Poutini's over other late-night poutine is the price.  It's pretty expensive for what they're serving.  When I used to party in Montreal, you could get a great poutine at 4am for half the cost, and they would layer it at no added charge.  I actually find it sort of insulting that Poutini's charges almost $2 more for a layered poutine.  I understand that it takes a bit longer to make, but we're not talking the difference between a G&T and a martini here."}
{"text":"I hate giving two-star ratings, but it really was just a \"meh, I've had better\" experience. The poutine was just okay. I love poutine, and am on a quest to find the best in Toronto. This wasn't it. If they worked on their gravy, it could be better than two stars, but even then...I'm not sure if I liked the fries. And I hated the \"cash only\" payment option. That and the fact that there are like, three chairs there and it was full. I will say however, that the dips menu enticed me and I would definitely go back to try those...but, for poutine? Not so sure. I know they have other options for poutine like pulled pork, but my standards are high: if you can't make a decent \"gravy-curds-fries\" poutine, then I'm not going to have much hope for the other kinds."}
{"text":"Being from the west coast. I made the novice assumption that proximity to Quebec would make the poutine better in Toronto. This one also got a lot of mentioned in top 10 poutine articles. So I went with high expectations. It was average. I'm giving it 3 stars because 2 seems rude and the server was polite and the food was not bad. 

The cheese was not squeaky. And the gravy was very mild. I actually like things bland so it worked for me but those who prefer salt will notice. The fries were perfectly acceptable. A couple that absorbed excess oil in the fryer but otherwise well within reason. A 2.5."}
{"text":"This was the best poutine I had in Toronto.  Poutine is a decent food but I'm not sure I would eat it frequently."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I consider poutine to be one of the greatest culinary inventions ever. So, I was excited when Toronto's second (Smoke's being the first) restaurant dedicated to poutine opened and received some great reviews. Unfortunately, Poutini's let me down with a pretty lacklustre version of this classic Canadian dish.

Poutini's is basically what you'd expect from a hipster poutine joint: cool staff, simple and appealing decor, a very minimal menu, reasonable-ish prices, good portions, and quick service as long as it's not too busy. They use proper cheese curds, they have great fries, and their gravy is decent (I tried both the vegetarian and meat gravy).

But, for a place that only serves poutine, Poutini's could do a lot better. First, their gravy is good but not great and could be hotter to melt the cheese curds. Second, and this is the clincher for me, they skimp out big time on the gravy and the cheese. The top layer is great but after that you end up with dry, cheese-less french fries. If I wanted fries I'd order them.

Poutini's does offer a more expensive layered version of their poutine, but I'm not about to pay more for something that should be standard. Poutine is meant to be a gooey mess with obscene amounts of gravy and cheese in every bite - from the top to the bottom. Poutini's just isn't cutting it. If this is what hipster poutine is all about I'll stick to the chip trucks."}
{"text":"The first 3 or 4 times I tried to have the vegan poutine, they were all out of the vegan cheese. 
But finally one day they had some....and all I have to say is - am I the only vegetarian out there that thinks Daiya cheese is like disgusting slime boogers in my mouth that taste gross? Because that is what Daiya cheese is to me - slime boogers. If you have ever purchased this cheese and touched it, you'll know what I am talking about. If you touch it there is this oily slime that gets all over your hands and it tastes weird. No thanks!

I'll take my poutine with REAL cheese curds and veg gravy (yum) or no cheese as all (if I'm having a vegan day).

p.s they play good music."}
{"text":"I love poutine. I love the fact that you can get poutine off at McDonald's in Canada. So when I was in Toronto for a 6-hour layover, I wanted poutine and by golly, I was gonna get some. After a quick Google search, I discovered Poutini's House of Poutine. I thought I was in heaven but I hadn't gotten my angel wings yet to glide me the mile-and-a-half there from Union Station. Nevertheless, I went and I got to see a bunch of cool things along the way. Poutini's is in a very cool part of town. There were a lot people walking around and the weather was gorgeous. When I got there, there was a counter and one of the ledge tables that come out from the wall. Other than that, there isn't much place to hang around. It seems like one of those places where you're in and you're out. I really liked how you can get a wide variety of different poutine. They had different variations of the dish, but what impressed me the most was the variety of gravy options that had. For someone who is horribly failing at eliminating gluten from her diet, I figured I could get the gluten-free gravy to make up for it. 

The poutine itself was good. There was nothing quite exceptional about it. As with all poutine, it  is definitely much better consumed hot. I always have the best intentions of eating leftovers, but it never happens. In this case, it was frigidly cold outside and cooled it down quickly. If you want get the best experience, hang out inside if it's cold outside. While I did enjoy most of it at its optimal temperature, it wasn't anything monumental. I think the allure of the place is the ease and quickness of it all. I am definitely still on the hunt for the best poutine!"}
{"text":"4/5 because they should have other vegan cheese. Also because the music is really loud and the cashier may not hear you correctly. But the cashier I interacted with ensured he heard me correctly. Even though the gravy is more watery than I'm used to, it tastes much better than any vegetarian gravy I've had at a restaurant. Also be sure to speak up when specifying the gravy since the music is really loud. They have a great selection of music as well. The super plus is that they open really late and can be delivered by UberEats."}
{"text":"Inevitably, after a long day and some libations at the Gladstone we ended up at Poutinis House of Poutine. Otherwise known as Om nom nom. Seriously. That's what it says on their sign! 

VIBE
I like the wooden log chairs and communal high tables for standing if need be. Getting your good quick fix. Staff were really nice and helpful. 

WE ATE
I've been here before and I felt like their gravy was similar to that of KFC. Thin, watery and a weird flavour. Maybe I had a few so or it's the toppings but tonight my bacon poutine (essentially bacon strips on top of the regular poutine) hit the spot. The digestive after-effects were not pretty. 
Friend had the pulled pork poutine. She was happy with it! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK
Poutine is an acquired taste. Taste around and see what you like! But usually I like my gravy thick, heavy and salty."}
{"text":"There's an old saying ... Canada could have been the best country on earth, they could have had American technology, English culture and French cuisine..but instead got American culture, French technology and English food.

Oh my friends who live in an ice box in the winter and suffer through humidity with mosquitos the size of Mothra in the summer, why must you be so hard on yourselves?

I've enjoyed some most awesome times in your country. 

Poutine. A killer of a meal. Just mouthing the words makes one a full on diabetic in an instant.

Ok Ok, before you Canucks get all up in my face about Montreal being the true home of my favorite fries, gravy and cheese curd combination ever, embrace this place. They rival their neighbors. 

Freshly made handcut=, blanched , double fried fries. Yes, they do that. Rich flavorful gravy that is worthy of your grandmas meatloaf. Cheese curds that belong besides some of the best in France.

It's done right. 

Open late, if you find yourself at Blue Jays game - skip the ballpark food and cab your butt here."}
{"text":"Eh, wasn't bad for a poutine.

I ordered a BBQ pulled pork poutine, and the pork was kinda dry and the cheese curds were so rubbery! It was alright...I would reccomend going to smokes poutine down the street instead."}
{"text":"Poutine here is awesome! I was just looking for a place that sells poutine and yelp brought me here! Service was good, and I really enjoyed my poutine! Definitely recommend this place to all who are planning to visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been once, after the bar. I almost didn't go in but who am I to deny a fry joint from being listed on my \"Fries\" list. I ordered straight up fries which kinda took a while to make. While waiting I was chatted up by someone who sang the virtues of the poutine. I ate my fries on the way home but only ate half either because there wasa lot to eat or because they were so friggin' salty. 

Service was great. 

Ambiance/setup was nice. 

I wouldn't go out of my way to go here (unlike what I do for Reggie's fries) but if I'm ever in the neighbourhood again I would go again."}
{"text":"I was excited for my first poutine since moving to Toronto, but was sadly disappointed. I got The Works Poutine, and for how many toppings were on it, the flavour was very bland. I might try their pulled  pork one some time to give it another shot, but for now I don't find it very impressive."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of poutine, but after moving to the states, it's become an obsession. Gravy, cheese curds and fries - WHY hasn't it become a staple food here?!  I miss this dearly. 

Anyway, on a recent trip home, my friends and I stopped at Poutini's. Frankly, I loved it. I ordered the layered poutine, and maybe that's why I didn't feel the lack of cheese curds/gravy in my order. The fries were perfect, the cheese was squeaky and awesome, and the gravy was pretty good (but yes, while I've had better gravy, it wasn't a deal breaker for me).  

I thought the service was really good too.  I went back the next  week with my sister, and once again, it was a similar experience, so I'm inclined to think that the food/service is consistent.  

The portion is rather big, but i guess for nearly $10, that makes sense.  The first time, I couldn't finish my order but the second time I went there, I shared with my sister and it was just the right amount. 

Definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"Poutini's hits the spot!  It is has a variety of options and offers vegetarian and vegan versions.  The place has limited seating and you literally sit on logs.  The vegetarian poutine is great.  Add some hot sauce and bleu cheese mayo to spice it up."}
{"text":"I have been to Poutini's House of Poutine for at least six times, and finally I'm writing my review of the place. I enjoy going here. I'm not a big fan of Poutine, but when I like how they twisted and have various options/flavors. When I read reviews, some people seem to not like it because it's not authentic taste? If authentic taste of Poutine is what you are looking for, maybe this place may not live up to your expecations. But this place overall provides a pleasant, casual atmosphere and you can drop by here to have small snack."}
{"text":"Went to Poutinini's maybe two weeks ago and the experience wasn't really anything to shout about. Everything about it was just...okay. Fries were okay, gravy okay (tried both the veggie and regular kind...veggie one seemed a bit sweeter and the regular one a bit saltier), cheese curds okay, atmosphere okay. Not bad, not great, just okay. The service was friendly though!

There's no real seating available so it's not very good for larger groups if you plan on dining in. They have two tables that are more conducive to standing but they do have three bar stools and I think there might be one or two chairs up front by the window.

I still liked it a lot better than Smoke's so if I had to choose between the two, I'd probably come back here. It's also a lot closer to my place, which makes it easier to come back to but I'm still on the hunt for some amazing poutine (haven't tried out many places so the hunt is still young).

Oh! Another good thing was that they serve their poutine in compostable containers and provide compostable forks as well. I don't even know if compostable is a word...recyclable maybe? Or biodegradable? Either way, they don't need to get tossed in the trash, which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"All hail poutine! Portions are huge and served with care. Embarrassed to say I ate a portion and a half. Friggin' worth it!"}
{"text":"To begin...I am born and raised in Quebec, so I know my poutine.

Okay...here we go!

It is not Quebec grade poutine.  Any poutine made in Ontario will not come close to Quebec poutine.  Why? 

Cheese curds in Ontario do not retain their characteristic 'squeekiness' because it is refrigerated.  Meanwhile, in Quebec they do not need to refrigerate the curds (it is THAT fresh).  Betcha didn't know that did ya?  In Quebec you can buy cheese curds in a depanneur, walmart, costco, or any grocery store totally unrefrigerated. 

However, Poutini's by far is the closest I've had to a Quebec poutine.  There are differences though - but still a top notch poutine.  Far better than Smokes or NY Fries (gag!).

1. Poutini's patate frites are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It is a superior fry.  Top notch.  This tells me the fries are most likely cut on the premises, kept in cold ice water, blanched, cooled, then deep fried to perfection before serving.

2. Poutini's gravy is very good. Except they tend to over do it on the pepper which brings it down a notch.

There should be an option to have regular gravy (sans pepper) or gravy with pepper.  There is a vegetarian/gluten free friendly gravy available.

3. The cheese curds here are par for the course in Ontario. No squeekiness to be found anywhere.

4. Offering KETCHUP on a poutine? FAUX PAS!  Think of a 'Chicago Style Hot Dog', you would never put ketchup on that, then why would you defile your poutine by putting ketchup on it? Sacrement! Jamais!

5. LOVE their offering of specialty soda in a bottle. Unexpected pleasure to the poutine combination.

6. Nothing to do with the food, but remember to bring cash...it's a CASH ONLY establishment.  If you forget, there is an ATM available.

To wrap up, great place, good service, and the best poutine in Toronto (so far!).  Rating this 4/5 stars because of the cheese not squeeking, and the over peppered gravy."}
{"text":"Growing up in Northern Ontario, poutine is definitely one my vital food groups.

The poutine at Poutini's is not the best I've ever had.  The gravy is a bit on the thin side, fries are under cooked and could be crispier.  Cheese curds are plenty and squeaky so that's a saving grace.  

I ordered the large sized layered poutine ($8.50) for myself...probably should have stuck to the regular as it was much too big for me to finish.  I was too greedy for my own good.

Seating is limited to a few long tables, stools and small bench outside the restaurant, which makes Poutini's a more grab 'n go kinda place."}
{"text":"Whenever I am back in the ol' stomping grounds, there are a few things I need: 1. A Leafs game, 2. Molson on draft, and 3. Poutine. So after a night of drinking on King St we stumbled upon Poutini's, which is open hella late BTW. I wanted fries. I wanted gravy. I wanted cheese. And I wanted bacon. Duh. On the menu was The Works Poutine: Traditional Poutine + sour cream + bacon + chives. This is what dreams are made of. Sure I might have gained a couple of lbs in Toronto, but if you must, do it with poutine. WILL. BE. BACK."}
{"text":"Coming to Canada for the first time, I wanted to try some \"authentic\" poutine. I can't say I know what good poutine may be like but a friend recommended this place so we decided to go give it a try. The workers were very welcoming but I was pretty disappointed with the food because even though the flavor of the gravy went well with the fries, the poutine was just not hot enough and the cheese curds were still cold and hard. Sad to say I won't be coming back and would look for other poutine places to try next time."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and the servers are always friendly. I always order the layered poutine. Poutini's definitely has the best poutine I've had in the GTA, however I recommend you request they add gravy to the middle, otherwise halfway through your poutine, you'll reach plain french fries, nothing else."}
{"text":"+ crispy fries, lots of cheese curds
-  needs more gravy

Went here last night after a concert downtown.  It was a little busy at 11:30pm on a Saturday. Ordered the traditional regular, $6.99.  Lots of staff working here, not sure why they need so many. Waited for about 10 minutes for the order. Lots of room to wait with a few tables to eat at or wait.

The poutine came in a round container with optional lid.  The fries were nice and crispy, with a good amount of cheese, but not enough gravy. I would have liked the gravy to be more of a beef flavour.  I thoroughly enjoyed the poutine, and would certainly get it again."}
{"text":"I kind of expected more out of this place. It was open late, it was crowded, but I was disappointed to find out that there was only plain poutine available. It's kind of a like a sausage house that only sells one kind of sausage. I was looking forward to having bacon put on my poutine. Oh well, I suppose if you're open at 3:30AM, then you should get to dictate what you want to sell. Oh, with tax, it cost $7."}
{"text":"Thank you Anthony Bourdain for making this Poutini known to me! After seeing this place on an episode of The Layover in Toronto, Poutini went to the top my list of places to go while in Toronto.

I came here at about 3am after a night of drinking, which is the only time it's acceptable to eat something like this. This place serves Poutine with various toppings, all of which are as unhealthy as you can get. For those who don't know, Poutine is french fries covered in gravy with cheese curds. I got mine topped with bacon...

After saying a quick prayer, I dove into it head first and killed it in about 5 minutes. It's deliciously unhealthy and one of the most satisfying intoxicated meals I've ever had. 

Aside from the Poutine, its a destination in itself. Everyone is excited to be there and the first bite seems to bring the same level glee to everyone's face. There were people in here from their early 20's to 50's. 

There are a few tables to post up at while devouring your Poutine. Basically a ground zero of drunken conversation with whoever is there as well. 

Thank you Anthony Bourdain."}
{"text":"I'm not a poutine expert, but Poutini's definitely took care of my junk food craving. I love the squeaky cheese, the gravy was very good and the fries were tasty and did a great job of soaking up the gravy. I got the traditional, and also tasted The Works (which has bacon, sour cream and chives in addition to the cheese and gravy). I can't imagine needing mayonnaise on top of all that, but there a few mayo options as well."}
{"text":"A Canadian delicacy? Yum. Having never eaten poutine, and being vegan, the goods at this place were awesome. The atmosphere, not so much.

The vegan poutine was made with Daiya cheese and vegetarian gravy. Apparently there's a gluten free gravy option as well. The music was SUPER LOUD. There were a few community type tables and very few uncomfortable looking chairs that no one was taking advantage of. The music was so loud I couldn't enjoy my poutine and had to go outside and sit on the sidewalk. 

Overall, worth the trip. We just happened to show up on their anniversary and got a 2 for 1 deal. June 15. Maybe they'll do the same offer next year if you want to put it in your calendar :)"}
{"text":"During a recent day trip to Toronto a friend and I dropped in for a late lunch. We were enticed by a nice looking web site and the curiosity to try a new spot. Nice decor, friendly staff and fully compostable containers and cutlery were the things that caught my eye, however it wasn't enough. 

For what I was paying for (and considering they specialize in one single item) I wasn't blown away by the taste. The fries were so-so and even though some of them still had the skins on them (yum), they didn't taste much different than microwave fries. The gravy was nothing special and the curds didn't blow me away either (didn't see any signs to indicate they were using local cheese either). Poutini's only had three chairs in the entire place with plenty of standing room only and a bench outside. On a early Sunday afternoon we were looking to relax, not stand around some more. There was area to tuck stools away under the tables but it was as if someone had made off with them. There is also no washroom here (they were directing customers to go to the local Starbucks instead, which I'm sure Starbucks doesn't appreciate) so there is no way to see if you have cheese curd dangling off your face.

It was nice to eat at a place that carries sodas, fun items like 'pulled pork & poutine', but sadly not a unique enough taste that I'll be back.

Cash only."}
{"text":"Cheese churds are difficult to melt and this place couldn't do it. The gravy for the fries was very good not too thick. It's a bit pricy for what you get but if Im in the area i would come back if im craving poutine. ventilation is not very good i usually stand outside while waiting for my food. wait times aren't too bad"}
{"text":"I feel like if you're complaining about poutine you're taking life too seriously. The combination of fries and cheese and gravy - however mediocre - is still pretty good in my books. I admit that the poutine at Poutini's might not be MINDBLOWINGLY delicious...but it's still enough to make me happy after a night out. I always get the veggie poutine without a drink and then regret not getting a drink (woe is me). Poutine is by nature a salty, salty beast. 

Staff usually look surly but are almost always quite friendly. Music is bumpin'; dancing optional. Veg-friendly poutine options and biodegradable bowls (with lids for leftovers!) are added bonuses.  

Also, BOO TO CASH ONLY. But at least there's an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Poutini's easily does in a pinch.

Whether you're grabbing a quick bite or fulfilling some late night drunken cravings you can get a solid poutine here. Will it be the best poutine you've ever had or one that will knock your socks off? No, but it's consistent and tasty. 

My only complaint is that they're cash only, but they do have an ATM on site if you need cash."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! The music is top quality and the staff was cheery and inviting, they even informed me of a secret menu (just ask for Paulina)"}

- gravy is not too salty.. not too much.. at least for the one that I ate...

{"text":"Located in  the West Queen West which is one of my new favorite neighborhoods in Toronto. Found Poutini's online listed as the #2 place that serves the best poutine in the city. Definitely had to try it.

The cash only shop is small-ish, which I guess can only seat less than 10 people. It was quiet when we checked it out, but smelled really nice as soon as we walked in.

The poutine was very filling, the only downside for me is that the curds were clumped up into a big ball and sadly was a little cold.

I guess for the price it was decent, not the best poutine that I've had, but for a quick bite, it was good enough for me."}
{"text":"+1 for being open late! We came here last night after an evening of drinks with the girls. The place was RAMMED but the service was super quick (+2).  

It is a very small place (barely enough room to stand) and there are no tables, so don't make yourself comfortable! This is mostly a spot for takeout. It was freezing out so we stood against the wall eating poutine and getting bumped by people trying to get by.

Now for the important part - the poutine. There are 2 sizes, tiny and regular (although the regular looks like a bucket!) They had about 5 different types of poutine, but nothing crazy and they sold out of the mushrooms and onions one (how do you run out of onions+mushrooms?!) I had a tiny bacon poutine which tasted okay but here was the problem, the packaging is like a cup. So they put the fries in and cheese on top (plus bacon) and there is not enough room in this cup to mix it or dig down without spilling the goods, so you end up eating the cheese and bacon and then are left with plain fries on the bottom. It was super disappointing and I heard several people around me complaining about the same problem.

All in all, I was not impressed. I much prefer Smoke's to this place (Smoke's has a bigger selection, food has a more wow factor and the packaging makes it easier so you can actually eat fries with your toppings) Don't think I'll be back here again, unless it's the only option around."}
{"text":"Haven't had squeaky cheese curds bathing in luscious gravy sauce nestled amongst root vegetable deepfried carb-sticks in a while... oh this canadian cuisine. 

This gravy reminds me of Swiss chalet sauce, but i also haven't had that in a while. Maybe this is the first time I have had poutine without a beer. It tastes better with beer (or after many bevvys).

Cashier never asked me what size and assumed I wanted a big one. I was going to order a small one. Ended up just getting bigsize. Now I am hearing a girl get automatically upsold... I guess that dance is one that works- 

There are no restrooms at this establishment?! Mmmhhm

To be honest, I probably enjoyed the paintings of poutine more than the actual food consumed here this time.

I would recommend Poutinis only if inebriated or extremely hungover. Once upon a time, I used to tell people visiting Toronto about making this their poutine stop... Maybe I just don't love poutine anymore.

Today, i was in the area and thought I'd treat myself. It was okay."}
{"text":"I would recommend the BBQ pulled pork on top of the layered poutine. The bigger size is a good size to share or eat yourself if you're really hungry. The gravy to cheese curds to fries ratio was amazing as well."}
{"text":"The vegan routine here is pretty decent, just wish they had more vegan topping options."}
{"text":"You need a fix, baby?  Jones-ing for some curds and gravy?  Craving those fries, baby?  I can hook you up.  Yeah, just go down Queen St, a little past Ossington and see my friends at Poutini's.  

Talk to the guy at the counter and he'll set you up.  Yeah, make you feel real good.  Start with the \"tiny\" because this is strong stuff.  Work your way up to getting the bigger sizes.   Just a couple of nibbles and you'll be feeling fine.  I wouldn't lie to you, baby.  Just take a bite, everyone's doing it."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good.  I was a tourist in Toronto and considered this experience a pleasant novelty."}
{"text":"Love that they cater to all types of diets. Poutine is great! Staff just seems a bit off."}
{"text":"Best chain poutine in Toronto hands down. Poutinis keeps it relatively simple compared to some other establishments in Toronto and I got one feel like simplicity is key when when it comes to a food as traditional as poutine. The fries are really good and the gravy is solid. Would definitely recommend this post-club or if you're craving a snack in the area!"}
{"text":"What to get:
Poutini with Bacon and Chives

I decided to come here after Anthony Bourdain featured it on his show Layover. We came here late night around 2am with the line almost out the door but it moved quickly. 

Poutini was amazing with the smokiness of the bacon. It is almost blasphemous to say it but I think it is better here than when I went to Montreal. My girlfriend and I were thinking about the poutine days after and even contemplating taking a $15 cab ride just to get it."}
{"text":"A place dedicated just for Poutine? I'm sold. If I lived in Toronto  I would be SO FAT as I would probably eat poutine every day. They have \"mini\" and 'regular\" sizes so we shared a \"mini\" size so that we didn't feel too glutinous. The fries were obviously freshly cut and the gravy was delicious. Best part...ACTUAL cheese curds. They have lots of other fancy toppings...the bacon they used were thick slices of Canadian bacon...eh!  I may need to do one more visit in my last 3 days here... hehehe"}
{"text":"A good place to get a late night snack. $6 for a small, but its not even that small. We shared this among three of us since we weren't that hungry.

The fries are a little too oily for me and the crispy ones are rare. The gravy isn't too heavy which is good. The bacon and cheese curds added the right amount of salt and texture.

Not bad for a snack, but I wouldn't travel out of the way to get it."}
{"text":"Being French-Canadien there are 2 things I know in this world: Celine Dion's full discography,  and Poutine... of course. I have to say that Poutini's is very suprising. Definitely an above average delight."}
{"text":"I dunno. Poutini's wasn't more than OK. For a place that specializes in JUST poutine, the flavour was weaker than a lot of other venues that serve a hundred other things but happen to count poutine among their offerings (Utopia, BQM, Betty's, etc.).

At 3am on a Friday Poutini's was uncomfortably busy and crawling with 905ers and yelly drunk girls shivering in tiny cocktail dresses. After a considerable wait I ordered the \"Teeny Weeny Tiny Poutini\" with veg gravy for $4.99 and got the hell out of there as soon as it was ready. The counter staff was surprisingly lucid and patient considering the clientele and amount of noise. Music was great - Radiohead, M.I.A. and Spoon.

The gravy, as others have mentioned, isn't hot enough and nothing comes close to melting. The fry quality was good but they weren't wet enough, and I sure as fuck am not paying extra to have my poutine layered. Poutine is supposed to be a heaping, gooey, liquidy mess and the cheese should string up when you load your fork. I had no desire to eat the whole cheese curds and after a few bites I was over it. 

If I have a poutine craving, I would not think to come back here. The late hours on weekends (till 4am) mean it'll constantly have customers, and the standards and expectations of said clientele in such a state of inebriation are low anyway. They just need some grease to soak up all those Jaegerbombs."}

As I write this I'm eating Smokes Poutine, which I slightly prefer as long as it's the veg gravy. But, this review is about Poutini's, so let's bring it back to the Queen W poutinerie. 

Poutini's is an adorable HOP (House of Poutine) perfectly placed for late night drunk passers-by. They're open hella late on weekends (3:30am!) and have many different poutine options.

My main beef with this poutine is the temperature of the gravy. It just isn't hot enough to melt the curds, leaving them cold in the middle. Their normal gravy is also a bit bland, and I have yet to try their veg gravy. Gravy is 1/3 of a pout-pout and they just don't have it right.

They have their music on really loudly late at night. Others have noted this as being annoying, but I've been involved in some pretty rad late-night dance parties here, so I'm a fan of them bumpin' the hits. 

PEPPER POINTS: For offering a vegan poutine. I'm not a vegan, but I recognize that it's a considerate menu option. 

PEPPER'S PISSED: Cash only. They have a high-charging ATM at the front, but still... girl needs to save her cash for her cab ride home."}
{"text":"The best poutine I had in Toronto!

*CASH ONLY*

WAIT: Came on a Friday afternoon and there was no one inside.  We ordered right away and our poutine came out in about 5 minutes.

ATMOSPHERE: It's pretty small inside, no bathroom and only 2 long high top tables with bar stools and then a counter area that faces the window.  You order at the front and then wait for your food to be called.

FOOD: They have lots of options but we went for the \"works\" poutine which is essentially a baked potato poutine.  

WORKS POUTINE - It has chives, sour cream, gravy, cheese and bacon.  The pieces of bacon were HUGE and very generous.  We wanted the smallest size but they made a mistake and gave us one size up.  In hindsight I'm glad because for us sharing, it was enough.  The fries weren't drenched in gravy (which I prefer) so it was a little more crunchy and the bacon plus the cheesiness was perfect.  It was delicious.

Overall, my favorite poutine while in Toronto but probably because I enjoyed the toppings so much."}
{"text":"I keep hearing all these people raving about Poutini. I find the poutines rather dull and average nothing particular special about the flavour. Smoke's is little bit better, but offer a whole lot more in choices. And while I was there, there were tons of flies around the front window of the shop. As a food establishment, I would expect the owners to do something to maintain a decent level of cleaniness. Just because the flies are not in the kitchen doesn't mean it's OK.  Overall,  a bit overpriced for commonly found everywhere poutine."}
{"text":"It's not the best poutine that I have ever had nor is it the worst.    It hit the spot.    The inside of the restaurant is really clean and the staff were friendly enough.    The chalkboard menu was large but they didn't have much of a dining area.  Maybe three or four stools and a counter.     The portion sizing was fair for the price and this place is open later than most being in the bar district.    Three out of four is what I would rate it."}
{"text":"The layered poutine is awesome. Layered with extra cheese curds.

They have vegetarian and vegan options, too.

It's basically the best poutine in Toronto that I've tried.

The downside is the incredibly loud, and quite frankly often annoying, music. And I love music of all varieties. I just prefer not to be sonically blasted while I enjoy my poutine. In my experience, it's usually a loud, pulsating variant of techno (sorry, not sure what the kids are calling it these days)."}
{"text":"this is the best poutine shop in toronto, if you want cheesy,hearty, warm, flavorful plain(or bacon filled) poutine, then this is the place for you. 
the only negative is no bathrooms and they have the music at a louder then normal level"}
{"text":"Nice place. It has been going downhill recently. I use to like it more than Québec poutine, but not so much now. Now they try to charge you 30% more than what the menu says. So watch out."}
