{"text":"Standard Chinese restaurant with notably better than average sushi selection and quality.  Very friendly owner and servers.  Possibly second only to Chinatown Inn when it comes to Chinese Restaurants in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot. The staff and management is very friendly and they make things special for me. If you are on a low fat diet they will actually accommodate you. They are always very nice to my daughter when we come in and they will give her little treats sometimes. The sushi is very good and unlike some Sushi places they do not skimp on the wasabi or ginger. The portion sizes are huge. When I order something it feeds me dinner and then lunch the next day. Therefore, the prices are worth it. Also, when you call to place an order they actually don't rush you on the phone, and they will answer your questions. One of the most impressive things about them is when they say your food will be ready in 15 minutes IT IS.  I highly recommend this place, Osaka is great."}
{"text":"Best General Tao's white meat in pittsburgh.  Huge portions.   Above average sushi.  The rainbow roll is highly recommended."}
{"text":"My family and I are food people. That said,  Osaka is our destination for great Chinese food. After catering an event we hosted and knowing the owner for years, we've grown quite close to this restaurant since it first opened.   Onto a review. Decor is pretty simple, very   Nice and clean, but not too formal. Kids are welcome, the servers are nice. The food is delicious, and I always come here as it is a quick local stop. When I don't want to go out, takeout works perfectly. This is my favorite restaurant in my area.   Onto dishes I recommend. The orange beef or chicken is great. If you don't like your chicken fried or would like to eat a bit healthier, they are fine with a different way to cook it if you ask. Also, the sesame beef and fried rice are great. We always order the string beans too. Every appetizer I've had was great, and I only recall one not-so-great meal there a few years ago with the beef with broccoli because the sauce was bland. The owner will also often come out and talk to the diners, when he's there. Not always though, because he may cook at times or the restaurant is packed (it's busy when we go.)  Go. It is a great experience, much better than what the other people say. Try it!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place sooner! We ordered soups, salads, sushi, fried rice and lemon chicken! All were great! When you are seated they give you cucumbered in a very yummy dressing and the fried chips with cold duck sauce also very good! I have ate food from here 3 times in 10 days!! Also they dont deliver where I live but they do you meet you somewhere which I thought was great :)"}
{"text":"I am crazy about Osaka!  They have fantastic sushi and great Chinese food.  The decor is your typically humdrum Chinese restaurant, and the stripmall location leaves much to be desired, but the food is consistently delicious and the service is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This is the best place for your money I'd you like sushi. Great staff and great food. I have been all over world and have eating a lot of sushi I live in pgh and this is the best. Nakama sucks and over priced. Go hear for great staff and great food"}
{"text":"Definitely would not order delivery from here again.  Food was bland and lacked a creative flare. The \"amazing chicken\" was overly breaded and the imperial beef lacked spice and came with like 2 pieces of broccoli, which left me unimpressed and under satisfied."}
{"text":"Terrible attitude from the waitress. The food is pricey for the service you get. The waitress was unreasonably rude and can't communicate in English. She forgot part of our orders and the manager is just as useless. Never going back there."}
{"text":"This place is quick consistent and great service- really fresh sushi! Never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least once or twice a month for 5 years. It is hard to beat their lunch specials. Really good food for a really good price with the lunch special. Service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Very clean tables and floor. Waiters knowledgeable about menu.  Were not rushed to order.  Extensive menu.  The Sesame Chicken tasted fantastic and the portion was large.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The best sushi in Pittsburgh. I love going there. It is a very warm and intimate enviroment. The customer service is amazing and very friendly. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been there multiple times and I've enjoyed it every time. Food was great and I received excellent service from both the servers and the employees at the front desk. The prices are all reasonable and a rather good value. I will definitely be returning here again."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from them, not because their food is great but because they are the only Chinese restaurant that delivers and taste acceptable around where I live. I always tip the driver 20% or above until lately I was having an important phone call when they delivered and forgot to tip the guy. I was told on the phone that I need to tip the driver the next time I called them. I said Ok and apologized, explaining I was on the phone that's why I didn't tip the driver. And I did tip the driver this time. However I FOUND A BIG PIECE OF EGG SHELL AND A PIECE OF HAIR in my food. This has never happened before so I dont know if they did it on purpose or not. As far as I remember tipping is OPTIONAL, and you should never throw egg shell and hair into other people's food."}
{"text":"Good Egg rolls. Good homemade dumplings. For the price(2 entrees and 2 egg rolls for $30), I was expecting more.   Chicken with black bean sauce was great, sesame chicken was not....bland and soggy.  If i can find somewhere less expensive with around same quality, wont be back here.   I do like the dumplings, but too pricey overall.  Good, not great."}
{"text":"I order take out from Beyond Menu more often than I'd like to admit.  Everything always arrives on time and the delivery driver is always friendly.  They have always contacted me when there was an issue.  I typically have the philly roll, salmon roll and spicy California roll.  Very good.  The steamed dumplings are also a favorite of mine.  Everything always arrives hot and neat."}
{"text":"Osaka has the best Chinese food in the Pittsburgh area! I ordered my all time favorite hunan shrimp! The vegetables were fresh and cooked just right! The rice and hunan sauce was so delicious too. They weren't stingy with the shrimp either which were cooked to perfection! They cooked with the jumbo shrimp! The food came quick and the service was great!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in pgh,we eat here at least twice a week,best food ever,and the staff are so friendly,definitely worth going"}
{"text":"I've ordered occasional delivery from here for a long time, but I've never stepped foot in the restaurant after all these years.  The main draw for me was that they delivery from open to close, which is really rare in the area.  Most only do dinner.  The food: nothing special, but not bad either. It's standard americanized Chinese fare, especially in the context of Pittsburgh. I think there has been a price hike recently, but the lunch special is still a good deal.   Word of caution: cold sesame noodles are extra peanuty here.   I forgot that I actually had sushi here a long time - the rolls I'd eaten before had been good - fresh fish, reasonable portions for the price. The sashimi lunch special - very generous portions consisting of 12 large cut pieces of fish and puts it at ~$1 per piece,  but the quality of the fish is mediocre. Quality vs quantity.... Personally, I started to feel a little sick. but if you're not the type to care, definitely go for it.  3.5 stars. The food does the job. more importantly, it gets it to me when i need it. I'll probably keep coming here when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Meh.. Edemame toooo salty. Ordered small asaragus roll.. Didn't show up. Entre was okay nothing spectacular. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"This is by far best Chinese restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. I order from here all the time and have never been disappointed. My favorite is general tso extra spicy."}
{"text":"Overall disappointed . I ordered 2 orders of eel sushi and she verified it. I only received one. It was good though.   I ordered the honey walnut chicken which anywhere else is a white creamy sweet cause not here, dark salty and not very good sauce with little chicken.  I ordered a large glass of wine and received a small.  Heard a lot of good things about this place but overall not too good."}
{"text":"This place is strange if nothing else. Food is average and decently priced for what you receive. They really pinch pennies here so you have to ask for just about everything including soy sauce. The strange part is the staff. The waitress is as rude as you can get. Chastises you if you don't order fast enough. She fell asleep at one of the tables so we had to keep getting up for water and so forth. The cook was also in the dining room but only half asleep. The sushi guy was hammering away at his station, creating an irritating racket. Another woman, I assume an owner, was engrossed with her register screen and totally oblivious to anything else. Another guy was feeding the fish. I mean this experience was Adams Family at it's best! No wonder we were the only customers in the place at 5:00pm. Probably won't go back. As I said the food is adequate but the rest of the show leaves you wondering why you didn't just stay home and save the money. La Choy anyone?"}
{"text":"I concur with the other positive reviewers and their observations, so I'll try not to repeat them. I have been eating here for several years and keep coming back. There's one waitress who is not as attentive but the others are exemplary. Owners are friendly, too. I moved to Beaver County for a while -- when I returned two years later and dined here again, the waitress named my favorite dishes and asked if that's what I'd be ordering!   The scallion pancakes are fab. Get them! Also, get a house salad. It's your typical mundane iceberg and carrot kind of medley but the dressing -- they make a unique ginger salad dressing that is heaven in your mouth. You'll be cleaning it from your plate. I recommend the scallion pancakes for that, or anything, really -- I'd eat a handful of foam packing peanuts if they had this salad dressing on it.  Like other reviewers have said, try the tea smoked duck. It's wonderful with hoisin (as they serve it with) or cold at 2am in the lurid glow of your fridge light."}
{"text":"We love this place and we go regularly. We love everything from the crunchy chip things to the sushi, miso soup and the dressing on the salad is phenomenal.  I in particular love the Tso's and the wife enjoys the Grand Marnier shrimp.  We've never had a bad experience here and like I said we eat here quite often. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch with a work colleague as this was close to his office. We split a yellow tail-jalapeno appetizer which for $10 came with only six pieces. It was nice that the jalapenos were spicy for once but it was a rather small appetizer compared to what I have had before.  I also had a miso soup, which was a bit on the sweet side, and a seaweed salad which was larger than normal.  I also had a yellow tail/scallion roll and a Inferno roll. Both had a bit too much rice but were fresh. The Inferno roll was quite good since it was also spicy.  Service was a bit spotty since our waitress did not speak very good English and brought out items at different times then we requested."}
{"text":"Meh.  Middle of the road \"Asian\" food."}
{"text":"Isn't it interesting how a predominately Chinese restaurant has a Japanese name?  Last I looked, Osaka is in Japan, not China!  The reason is probably because they serve sushi and sashimi here.    Otherwise this place seems like it's pretty much your typical Americanized Chinese food restaurant with your typical lunch menu.  There's a difference though.  The food here is really really good!  In fact they charge a couple of bucks more than most places for their lunch menu but it's worth it.  I went for my usual Chicken & Broccoli, however the chicken was very tender and juicy and the broccoli was crisp and fresh.  The spring roll was very light and melted in my mouth.  Someone else said this place is possibly second only to Chinatown Inn for this type of chow.  Hmmm--I'd say first Chinatown Inn, then Sesame Inn & Osaka in a tie for second."}
{"text":"Great food. I've tried several different Chinese dishes here and they were all delicious. I don't like sushi but my wife does and she said this is one of her favorite places to get it."}
{"text":"Very pleasant dining experience every time.  Polite, friendly staff and excellent service.  Food is an 8 on a scale of 10."}
{"text":"A nice and friendly establishment with tasty food. The main drawback is that the food is not of the highest caliber: the sushi doesn't taste fresh and items like the egg drop soup, miso soup and General Tso's Chicken are loaded with sugar and salt.   Tastiness often comes at a price."}
{"text":"really surprised by the negative reviews here... we order once every month or 2 (they're one of the only places that delivers in the area) and have never had a bad meal.  the delivery is always ridiculously fast - like, within 15/20 min of calling FAST.  we've only gotten sushi rolls once or twice, and it was decent, better than you'd expect from a strip mall place (they actually cater the sushi for the local country club).   the food is above average for Americanized Chinese food. we usually get the same stuff - fried dumplings, pork fried rice, soup, etc. the Singapore noodles are really good, too!   my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's kinda pricey, but we're willing to pay because it's good food and fast delivery.  we'll definitely continue ordering!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and awesome service! I always get the Ahi Tuna Pistachio roll. Also, very reasonably priced for such a high quality experience!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to Osaka in a long time but we used to be regulars. Tonight we decided to get an order delivered. We ordered cashew chicken, seafood wor bar and 2 sushi rolls.  The cashew chicken and seafood dish were identical except one had chicken and the other has seafood. Bland, no difference between the 2 dishes!! Rolls were good.  Very very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"Osaka is amazing! The interiors are simple and beautiful and tasteful and the food is served in large portions and is terrif! The Tea Smoked Duck still has me salivating. The server we had was really sweet (the dish I ordered is her personal favorite coincidentally), and she gave us complimentary orange slices at the end of our dinner which I thought was a nice touch. You'd never know the strip mall its in would have such a place. The portions are big enough to share easily too. You all should try them."}
{"text":"The sushi is fantastic.  However, anything fried has always been overdone, dripping in oil, or soggy.  This goes for tempura sushi as well.  Love this place, as long as I'm getting sushi.  Everything else?  Meh."}
{"text":"Chicken not fully cooked. Tofu mixed in with food. Will never order again. Refused to give refund when I called. Worst Chinese food."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much, but I just didn't have a good experience.  I went for lunch and ordered the sushi lunch platter. The rice tasted stale and dry. I asked for spicy on the sushi and they didnt add it. The waitress didn't understand a word I was saying. I'll try it again but am really disappointed"}
{"text":"Since living in the Crafton/Greentree area, I'd like to think I've tried the best of the best when it comes to sushi and Asian cuisine. Osaka is among my favorites because of the freshness of their food and quality of their service. If you want fresh sushi, quick take out, friendly service, and large portions, this is the place to go.  I've been coming to Osaka for a little over a year and a half now, and I've never been disappointed. Typically my experiences here have mostly been getting take-out, but I've had a couple dine-in experiences as well. From what I recall dining in was as pleasant as can be, no complaints there. On cold, rainy, days, however, there aren't many things I enjoy more than getting some good takeout to enjoy while wearing sweats in the comfort of my own home. Osaka has been a part of countless takeout nights between my boyfriend and I, and this is usually where I order takeout from when my brother is visiting, too.  My favorite roll has always been the Philly roll, and Osaka makes a mean one! This past weekend I got a Fantasy roll (Tobiko, tuna, and avocado), and a shrimp tempura roll. The pieces of fish were all rather generous and all of the ingredients seemed fresh as can be. I'm always a happy camper when I get some good sushi. Some of my other favorite rolls I've had here are the sunshine roll (tuna and white tuna), rock & roll (toasted salmon, eel, avocado, cucumber, and tobiko), and nearly any other roll I've tried. Usually I don't go all out with the super-complex rolls, but once in a while you have to treat yourself!  On to the dinner foods. My boyfriend has recently been ordering lamb every time we go out for Asian food, and he seemed to be pretty impressed with the portion size and quality of the lamb and scallions he ordered this past Saturday. During past visits I've ordered orange chicken, honey chicken, and General Tso's (basic, I know), and they were all amazing. They usually put takeout in a brown paper bag and even 1 person's order looks like enough to feed a small family. Pricing is comparable to other similar restaurants, but I've never complained about the price for as much food as you get here.  Overall there is nothing bad I can really say about Osaka off the top of my head. If anything, a pointer I have for newcomers is to not trust your GPS because it won't take you to the correct turn to get into Scott Towne Center. This was confusing at first, but it was so worth it once I made it to the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and we so appreciate that they can make some gluten free dishes (in addition to sushi). They keep gluten free soy sauce on hand."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Clean restaurant and excellent sushi. If you haven't tried them, you certainly should!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in the greater Pittsburgh area. First, the staff is so kind and when you're a regular, they remember you and it creates a great sense of community the way they pay attention to their customers.   One of my favorite things about this place is the free \"appetizer\" of fried wonton \"chips\" I believe they're called that they give to every table with dipping sauces. Who doesn't love a bowl of fried dough? It's like eating the best part of the eggroll (which, by the way, their egg rolls are also top knotch. I've only ever preferred Mark Pi's China Gate eggrolls more but they are closed now). I also love their house salad with the ginger dressing. Their dressing is creamier than most but is so good you could drink it like soup.  Their sushi is of amazing quality. I've had just about every roll there, and I have never had questionable fish quality and consistently good flavor. I've been to decent places that sometimes haven't thawed the fish out entirely or on the salmon sashimi there's some graying of the fish - never at Osaka. 100% perfect every time. The sushi boats are great for groups as well.   Their non-sushi dishes are delicious as well, reasonable portions that leave you full with maybe some leftovers but don't intimidate you either.   I always get a pot of their hot black tea or a Sapporo beer."}
{"text":"Great lunch & first time that my friend (who is mostly vegetarian) got to experience Osaka. The service is always on point & along with our lunches (they're lunch specials apply to Sundays too!), we sampled the Osaka & OMG sushi rolls. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great service today for lunch! My favorite sushi place in south hills and their lunch specials are so reasonable. Used the delivery too, always quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this restaurant a higher rating but it just doesn't deserve it. For food I would give it a 4 but for service a 3 at best. First time trying this restaurant we found just accidentally driving up in the Greentree plaza. The Italian restaurant next door Il Burnio was packed with no room but Osaka was completely open, looked very clean and new, and my husband was starving so we decided to give it a try. Even though there were only 2 other diners in the restaurant, our waiter was not friendly and did the bare minimum. He almost seemed agitated. The food was very good - we ordered Thai Chicken and Basil Beef. The Basil Beef was supposed to come on a hot plate (which it did) but when aj asked if I could have some spice added to it the waiter said no it could not come on a hot plate (?). Meal ended nicely with orange slices and fortune cookies. Ambiance, meh. Too bright lighting. Guessing this place is new and hoping they can improve. I wouldn't dine in again - would opt for takeout."}
{"text":"The name implies that this is a Japanese restaurant as does the fact that they serve sushi and sashimi.  However other than the sushi/sashimi the menu focuses on Americanized Chinese standards.  Personally I'm not a fan of typical Chinese food, so I stuck with the sushi.  I had a two color roll, it was pretty standard, yet still flavorful.  I also had the eel, which I really couldnt not tell you what kind as I let the waiter surprise me.  I was a cube of rice topped with a piece of cooked eel that had been braised in a very tasty sauce.  I actually really liked the eel and wished I would have ordered more and not had the roll.  Osaka is tucked into a weird interior corridor of a strip mall, so it can be hard to find if you aren't looking."}
{"text":"I was in the area and had a craving for sushi so stopped in for lunch. The last time I was here was probably 15 years ago when I worked in Carnegie and would come every few months for lunch specials, which were always good.  I had a dragon roll (primarily eel and avocado) and two orders ikura (four pieces of salmon roe sushi). Both were very good, and I will be picking up takeout from here quite a bit in the future since I am in Greentree fairly often.  For those eating in, service was fast, efficient, and attentive. It was on the early side of lunch time, so not very busy yet."}
{"text":"To celebrate Kay's new job, I whisked her over to Osaka in Greentree in the middle of last week for an extraordinary dinner. Located in a secret shopping center in the clouds, its eclectic coterie of neighbors includes Tamarind, Il Burloni, and Mad Mex.   Osaka serves a mix of both Japanese and Chinese dishes, but since we've grown weary of sushi and sashimi, we opted for hot dishes in lieu of cold.   Thankfully, we eschewed appetizers and went right for the mammoth entrees, both of which we narrowly finished.   I chose the Sizzling Red Snapper with Vegetables, a dish that lived up to its name in nearly  pyrotechnic fashion. Fried in an aurelian tempura-battered snapper and surrounded by the freshest of broccoli, infant corn cobs, and carrot slats, the fish was splashed with a salty, sticky, nebulous sauce (soy sauce?) upon service while on a hot plate, making for a steaming spectacle that caused much rubbernecking. The fish itself was as flaky, fragile, and savory as that which comes in newspaper cones from the UK, the vegetables acting as a grassy, earthy complement.   Kay's Tea Smoked Duck carried with it an esoteric essence that permeated the lardy, lusty flesh of the dismembered bird.   With no desserts of interest to us, our low-keyed and decidedly competent server brought to us a slew of orange wedges at the conclusion of our dinner. A swell, uncomplicated touch of hospitality and gratitude it was, and we appreciated it immensely.   Don't let the lack of hype dissuade you from journeying to the southern suburbs for Osaka's tiptop Asian fare. There is no teppanyaki nightclub flash to be found here, only serene ambience, pearly, elegantly elementary decor, and superb Oriental pabulum prepared with honor and great skill."}
{"text":"Met a friend for a quick meal and he selected O, since this is his go to chinese place.  Not easy to spot in Scott Towne Center shops, but a real nice restaurant with white table cloths.  Nice touch!  Service was very good, friendly and on top of everything.  Not real imaginative in my selection, just wanted shrimp fried rice.  It was very good, better than a neighboring chinese place!    Will have to remember this place since it is so convenient."}
{"text":"Took a large group there tonight.  Some food was over done and dry.  I'm a little disappointed as I love Chinese food.  Probably would not go again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here multiple times and the food is absolutely delicious. Definitely stop here if you love Japanese/Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"We have been going to the restaurant for 3 years, always great food and service.Had the worst experience ever Wednesday evening.Our waitress came over took our order, everything was fine.After bringing our appetizer, something changed with our waitress,she became so angry while I was ordering eggrolls and a to go order.The waitress actually yelled at me,while placing my order!! I became so upset, I decided not to order any more food! Never going back to Osaka,this women should not be working with the public.So sad cause the food is good."}
{"text":"Food was average. The waitress was in so much hurry to get us out. She would not leave us alone for 5 minutes to look at the menu. She tortured us until we ordered. After the food was ordered and brought to table, she was nowhere to find."}
{"text":"When a sushi roll is absolutely delish and its delivery, WHOA snap! The fantasy roll was awesome, and for less than $10 with an egg drop soup, delivered to my hotel room; I was a happy camper."}
