{"text":"Been coming here since 2006 well the crispy fried chicken with fried rice is always plentiful and their black bean noodle is always delicious it was better back then when they used to put in the tofu... the place looks a bit like the back alleys of Kowloon but the food is always fresh"}
{"text":"My go to place when I don't feel like cooking dinner.  Huge take out boxes filled to the brim with food for rougly $6-$7. Their Cantonese Chow Mein is to die for, and is even better the next day (i dont know why).  Your typical Chinese take out food, chow meins, fried rice, deep fried meats. Their most popular dish is the fried chicken/pork fried rice.  They are closed on Monday's. Cash only."}
{"text":"I am a culinary adventurer. It's been 20 years since I have come to this mall but I thought that I would try it, in search of a noodle place. I had done some research and was aware that this place existed.   There are two restaurants in the food court, this one is the only one that displays English signs. However, I didn't feel like ordering in Chinese, so, I spoke in English and it was almost like he didn't understand me, I had to repeat myself multiple times. Am I wrong? If you have an english sign, you're expected to speak English?  He took my money and rather than handing me the change like most people, he placed it on a tray. Like, he didn't want to make physical contact with me. Normally, I would be pro-anti-contact but I can't be assured that the tray that he put my change on was very clean.   Here's what my meal contained, it was the Goodies Special Noodle, which had 2 vegetables, 2 beef brisket, one chunk of fat and 3 large fish balls with noodles and soup. This meal is not very complicated, but it took them awhile to make it. Then, they yelled, \"Hey!\" over to me to come get my meal.   Looking at the meal, it looked edible; however, I did notice some iron flecks from the wok that were floating on the soup. The atmosphere was also unclean, the mirrors were broken and had a film on it. I hate to say it, but I have eaten better, cheaper and cleaner in the streets of Hong Kong.   The food was good, I had no complaints, but the flecks of iron didn't make my day. The tray was dirty, as well.   Service: 1/5 Food: 2/5 Atmosphere 0/5 Experience 2/5"}
{"text":"Portions are big and cheap price. Some are delish while some are blah. Had 1 order of fried rice with chicken on top, chili chicken with fried rice, fried fish and shanghai noodle. Always prefer to order here than next door because their fried rice is more yummy and its more clean than the next door lol. Chicken with fried rice is always a hit. Fish was crunchy. Shanghai noodle is bland and chili chicken taste like soy sauce cornstarch chicken, no kick at all. Payed $38 with tax. I will always come back for the chicken with fried rice. Btw the have good calamari too."}
{"text":"You know when you're feeling really lazy and you want to get take-out but you don't feel like analyzing a menu, or finding a decent, cheap place to go and you just want something easy?  Goodies is the go-to place for my family in those situations. Literally all you need is $10 and you can get three giant styrofoam containers of noodles, rice, veggies, stir-fry, anything! This place is a hole-in-the-wall (actually...it's a tiny booth) but you just phone ahead, come pick it up in five minutes, and go home happy.  One word of warning though -- there are three places in this food court, all next to each other, and if you choose one, you are not allowed to go next door at any point or else you will probably get glared at or they might ask you why you don't come there anymore. It's hilarious but definitely an issue. Be loyal to one and only one noodle shop."}
