{"text":"Food: Had beef hand-pulled noodles. The noodles were freshly made, chewy and well cooked. The broth is not salty, bonus! The beef pieces were big but not tender, hard to chew and to break down, lacked flavors~ no good no no! maybe i would order the vegetarian options next time~  Service: very fast  Price: good portion size/price ratio, quality meh~  Ambiance: situated on 2nd floor of Faubourg... Don't ask too much, eat and leave~"}
{"text":"At Yuki Ramen, you can get noodles... and more noodles. But they are damn good noodles! I order the BBQ pork noodle soup here almost every week and I never get tired of it. For $6.95, you get a large bowl of chewy, springy, long wheat noodles that are hand-pulled to order right before your eyes, steaming meat broth that is light and flavourful, but not overly salty, thin slices of Chinese barbecued pork, baby bok choy or nappa cabbage, green onions, and cilantro.   The menu is limited, with only about 8 options. I've also tried the beef noodle soup and the minced pork noodle soup and they were both good, but the BBQ pork one is by far my favourite. The only drawback is that Yuki Ramen is located in the Faubourg food court, which could really use a facelift. But you'll forget your surroundings once you dive into your hearty bowl of savoury noodles!"}
{"text":"Delicious hand-pulled ramen make this a perfect lunch spot, if you are ready to deal with the less-than-inviting food court atmosphere. Hours in the evening are limited."}
{"text":"it's so so for the price. It's located in the mall Le Faubourg. It's just average Chinese noodle since they changed owners.    Remember to return the bowl in you're eating there since they change 2$ for that."}
{"text":"Fresh made noodles, before your eyes. Great for lunch, and the price is really affordable for students. Will definitely come again :)"}
{"text":"(fyi, originally wrote this review in September 2012, and forgot it was in my drafts! So, as some time has gone by, your mileage may vary. I'm not trying it again just to compare though haha)  I had done some quick research to find some decent ramen places in Montreal, cause I loved having it when I was in Japan and craved it. This place got mentioned a couple of times, and I'm nearby daily so I decided to check it out. Honestly, I was expecting to be disappointed but... This is not ramen at all. The broth is extremely thin and tasteless, the vegetables were precut and the meat precut and precooked, so dry. I found the noodles a bit soggy and the seasoning was just... Pho-like, honestly. I'm disappointed, I really wanted to get my ramen fix, but this is not the place. :( if you've had ramen in Japan, I doubt you will like it here. If you haven't, honestly I'd rather have a good pho or Thai express, pretty similar or better..."}
{"text":"Those are awesome tasting ramen in a food court. You get the taste, you get the price, you don't get the ambiance. I find this perfect for a wandere. I feel lucky to know this exists."}
{"text":"Yuki ramen is not your typical ramen place, but they combine Japanese ramen with Chinese inspired meats and toppings.  The ramen is made fresh infront of you and although located in a hole in the wall food court, has some of the best fresh noodles in the city.  Almost all the combinations are hearty and go well together.  The broth is a little bit greasy, but still delicious to the last drop.  I appreciate all the Chinese style meats they have to offer as well, it's a nice change from the usual ramen and pork belly you get.  I always make sure to come back here when I'm around the area.  Definitely a rare find in Montreal!"}
{"text":"IN SHORT:  4/5 Excellent pulled northern Chinese soup noodle in a food court.  Get the beef noodle soup.   FOOD:  4.25/5 This food stall specializes in pulled Chinese noodle (??), phoenetically pronounced as La-Mien, the antecedent to the popular ramen.  Although confusing, as one reviewer pointed out, \"ramen\" means pulled noodle to / in Chinese. BEEF NOODLE SOUP:  Noodle is excellent, on par with some of the best.  You can see the meticulous pulling of the noodle right behind the glass partition.  The noodle is chewy, al dente, just right.  Even after submerging in the broth, the last bite is just as good as the first.  Brisket is well braised that the meat is tender and the other tissue has the collagen rendered soft.  The clear broth is flavorful, non-fatty, with hints of star anise and hot pepper.  It is complemented by some boiled cabbage, rather than the more popular baby bok choi from south of China. CHA SHU PORK SOUP NOODLE:  Pork is non-fatty, although unlikely to be \"cha chu\" (??), as it lacks the red ring of \"bark\".  The broth is light, pure and simple.  AMBIANCE / SERVICE:  2.5/5 Asian food court without obstreperous intrusions to your meal time.  Service is minimalist counter interaction.  LOCATION / PARKING:  3/5 Parking is metered city street.  There's a handicap reserved spot across the street, at the corner of St Catherine and St Mathieu.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS:  4.5/5 Scavenger hunting leads to unmarked wheelchair entrance from the back alley entry to the shopping center, on Rue St Mathieu, between St Catherine and Renee Levesque, closer to former.  Take the elevator to \"3\"."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the busiest stalls in the food court of the Faubourg building.   I come here once in a while in between classes. Their noodles are always freshly made, and cooked to order.  This is one of a few locations in Montreal where the noodles are hand made and freshly made every day. Protip: it's cash only, and ask for some of their home made chilies they keep behind the counter for regulars."}
{"text":"Well hot damn, this is a legit noodle shop. At noon on a Sunday, the young man was hand making noodles just to be dropped in my soup. The beef was plentiful and tender, and the noodles cooked just right. Not too much cabbage.  I wasn't as lucky as some of the others with the broth, which wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped, but perhaps it's because I was there too early. A good broth takes a long time.   I wouldn't hesitate recommending this place to any noodle soup fan."}
{"text":"Misleading name for the place as it's more hand pulled northern \"Chinese\" style noodles, soup and toppings vs \"Japanese\" style ramen.  The place would be good enough on its own without the ramen moniker especially for a fast food joint.  Almost inclined to take away a star for being misleading if you've got a hankering for Tonkotsu or  Miso broth with Nori and Kamaboko toppings."}
{"text":"Fresh, hand drawn noodles made and cooked before your eyes is a rarity these days. That alone is worth a visit.   The #6 ground soya sauce pork was a bit greasy/salty for my taste, but the noodle texture was very \"Asian al dente\" (springy with chew), a nice change from super soft rice noodles commonly found in Cantonese cooking.  A side of soup comes with the dry noodle options, although it did have some MSG, but not an overwhelming amount.  Serving size is large.  If you can finish a bowl, my hats off to you.  I'll be back to try the soup based noodles."}
{"text":"Giving it four stars for the meat, there's lots of noodles but needs egg or more veggies in the bowl. Very tasty and filling. :)"}
{"text":"Very nice fresh noodles. They made them on side. Good beef and clear broth soup. Not too spicy!"}
{"text":"Pro: - Awsome hand-pulled chinese noodle.   - Some dishes are a lot better than others. (#1, the marinated vegetable and pork stir-fry noddle is my favorite).   - Generous portion, especially if you ask for extra noodle, which they'd serve you for free.  -8$ all included for more of the dishes.  Con: - This is a chinese noodle place through and through. More precisely, they serve  Lanzhou-style lamian. (See Lamian on wikipedia for more detail). If you're looking for the thick-brothed, heavy flavor Japanese style ramen here you'd be sorely disappointed. If you're looking for more western/northern chinese style noodle, this place is actually pretty decent this side of North America.  - Again, some dishes are a lot better than others, personally, I really can not recommend the BBQ pork noodle, the pork is cold and dry, and actually not that flavorful or tender.   - Faubourg doesn't have much dining atmosphere to speak off... (it's like desolated large food court) I wouldn't even bring my friends here for a outing."}
{"text":"Good noodles with pork. Traditional Chinese food is Devine. Hard to find the place though. It's located at the second floor of the building"}
{"text":"I want to love this place - I really do. Fresh made noodles, before your eyes. But the bbq pork ramen soup I had lacked any real flavor in the broth which was a bit disappointing. Soup though was cheap $6.95 if I remember correctly for a large bowl.  Would be great for a pick me up after a long night of heavy drinking.  Yuki is located on the second level of a dying food court at 1616 Rue Sainte Catherine (Le Fambourg Complex) Worth checking out, just to see the noodles being made and cheap enough to try all their soups until you find one you really like. Unfortunately we only made it down there once.  While I would't go out of my way to make a trip down here I'd definitely recommend them if you are anywhere in the area."}
{"text":"Very average Chinese hand pull noodle. I like the one in Eaton center food court-Nudo better. The beef was over cooked too much. The soup is just Ok not very attractive."}
{"text":"Was not expecting a cheap bowl of ramen to be so good! Much less from a restaurant in the Faubourgh. I ordered the #2 BBQ pork ramen and was very satisfied with it. The bowl does not seem to be as big as other ramen restaurants for similar prices but they put in a good amount of noodles and meat to fill you up. There is nothing more legit than watching the cook roll out the noodles by hand.   The bowl was $7.50 and was ready within 2 minutes. It is important to keep in mind this is not Japanese ramen, but is a serious contender for choices at the same price level."}
{"text":"Hand made noodle ... You can't get anything more fresh than this! Wish I found this place sooner. The portion is generous and the soup is so very flavourful. Perfect for a cold winter day!"}
{"text":"Best ramen that I have had in Montreal so far.  The place is in a rundown food court, but they pull the noodles right in front of you and the taste is very authentic and Chinese.  I have has their pork and pickled veggies soup ramen 4-5 times now and I have also tried the pork sauce (which comes with a soy hard boiled egg) once.  Both tastes amazing.  I talked to the owners and they told me the place has been open for 3 years.  Hope the good work keeps up!  I go there about once a week for a fast dinner now.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"For food court noodles, this place is a tad more expensive than Chinatown restaurants! However the noodles and soup are delicious and totally worth the trek to this gloomy food court!  Service is fast and extremely friendly. They take AMEX!!!! The chef will make your noodles right after you order! Woot woot!! The beef is very tender and extremely flavourful. The braised pork #11 soup is very very very delicious!!! But fatty. I will return!!!!  This is Chinese food. If Japanese ramen is what you're looking for, go to Kazu!"}
