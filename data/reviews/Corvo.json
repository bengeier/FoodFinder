{"text":"I love this place and a specially the patio facing the CN tower what a view!! The best in town. The New owners are Italian nice people it is a family business Martino his partners and their family are very welcoming... great food we had the charcuterie and the cheese plater to die for with the Italian sausages. Highly recommended. Gracié millé."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I had to for this establishment.  Cafe Corvo is amazing all-around.  The staff, the food and the level of service was next level."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved eating at Corvo's during our stay in Toronto and would highly recommend them. The food is delicious and ambiance is very chill. The service was on point, everyone really makes certain the customers are happy including the owner which is nice to see. We will be sure to come here again the next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Cute little hidden spot in the midst of Downtown Toronto. I really enjoyed the margarita pizza."}
{"text":"This place does NOT disappoint! WOW! I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo and the margarita pizza! Both were quite pleasing. The fettuccine Alfredo is in this exquisite medium bodied, nutty, buttery cream sauce. The fettuccine was cooked perfectly al Dante and there was a very generous amount of sauce in this dish. Great, fresh pasta! The margarita pizza was Napoleon style with fresh pieces of Basil and big spots of mozzarella cheese the sauce is sweet and generously portioned. Big portions! I'd order this food again for sure! Yum! Can't wait to go there in person with family and friends."}
{"text":"Love this little Italian wine & snack bar. I've walked by Corvo unassumingly many times, but finally had a chance to stop by. The $$$$ reflection for pricing on Yelp seems a little off, because I found their pricing to be more than reasonable for the area (maybe $$-$$$). They also have a wine special on Wednesdays for only $8 a glass. We had the wild boar sliders and the salami pizza. The sliders were outstanding. I really liked the patio and the ambiance inside. Great new addition to the neighbourhood. I'll be back to try out some more things from the eclectic menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live just down the street from Corvo, but we had never been before today. This afternoon we went for an early dinner/patio drinks. The patio \"vibe\" overall is nice, there are cute string lights, comfortable seating and chairs etc.   My boyfriend ordered a beer assuming it was a full pint, but it was not (it was a half pint size). I ordered a glass of the house white and it was okay, but had not been fully chilled which (for me) is important for white wine. This wine seemed like it had been stuck in the fridge 30-40 minutes before being served. So far okay - right?? Well, then our food came...   I ordered the orecchiette with wild boar sausage and rapini. I promise you, it was the most repulsive meal I have ever eaten ... and by eaten I mean had one bite of. The sausage meat was a light pinky red and in my mind was undercooked (yuck). There was very little (perhaps zero) seasoning of any type on the pasta just a TON of butter and oil. It was swimming in grease. I'm really not a picky person, and pasta is kind of a difficult thing to mess up.   My boyfriend ordered the margarita pizza and it was also covered in oil. My boyfriend is probably the least picky eater in the world and he only had one slice of the pizza and said that it was so salty he couldn't eat it.   After my one bite of food I knew that I wouldn't be able to eat it. The server came back and asked if she could get us more drinks and I said no just the bill please. She asked if we wanted our food packed up and I said no thank you and she said okay! Did not address the fact that we had barely picked at our food at all - nothing. In my mind that is just terrible service.   This is my first one star review and hopefully my last. It boggles my mind that people have given this place such positive reviews. Our experience was completely at odds with what some other reviewers have said. Needless to say we won't be back which is too bad since it is so close by.   Oh - one final thing - while we were waiting for our bill a big stick/branch fell off a tree onto me and into my food. Obviously we can't control nature and its not like I was going to eat the food anyways, but still!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing and the food is even better. The soulful artwork combined with the exposed brick gives it a real sexy vibe. The pasta was delicious and filling. Do not let the odd shape dish fool you, it's a lot of food. Whatever the pasta of the day is...ORDER IT! The staff was friendly as well. It is definitely worth a bunch more trips."}
{"text":"Cool and friendly atmosphere, laidback. The best Negroni ever! Seriously Italian. Tucked away in a cute and leafy neighborhood. Sat at the car and talked to folks from around the planet, wish I lived down the street instead of a plane ride away!"}
{"text":"This Italian tapas cafe is a gem with a great view. The owner, Martino, is so kind and friendly. Ida is a lovely server. I sipped a perfectly made martini and ordered a charcuterie tray and arugula salad. The pizza and pasta enjoyed by the neighboring table looked delicious but is not on my Keto plan."}
{"text":"Best Italian dinner we've had in a while and we've tried all the places around here.  Do yourself a favour and try it out. Extraordinary service, incredible food. We had the kale salad, mushroom ravioli and boar sliders, and all three were best in class.  Extraordinary!"}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered from Foodora but each time that I have, I'm always satisfied! Delicious pasta and decadent desserts, I've never ordered anything that I've regretted. I'll definitely be ordering from Corvo again"}
{"text":"My visit to Corvo was great. I came in for an early drink and stayed for dinner.  I had my choice of tables and picked a spot on the front patio with a great view of the park and the CN Tower, a perfect spot for a excellent summer evening. The wonderful server, Olivia, recommended an excellent Caprese salad, simple and delicious.  I'm really glad I also ordered one of the pasta of the day options. It came out with perfectly cooked penne pasta, creamy tomato sauce, basil, broccoli, asparagus and flavorful Italian sausage.  I can't wait until I get to visit Corvo again."}
{"text":"What a find. In an unassuming little space near the Soho Metropolitan sits this family owned and operated gem. The food was excellent. So good. The service even better. The owner was happy to introduce himself and tell me a little about the history behind the recipes I was enjoying. 10/10 will be back."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband for the first time on a beautiful Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The patio is lovely overlooking the park and the service on point and attentive.  We ordered a bottle of Chablis and we ordered to share the $33 prix fix Tapas tasting menu and loved everything:  Arugula salad, bruschetta, orecchiette wild boar sausage, and tartufo.  The hand made orecchiette was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked and was amazing in flavour.  I felt like I was back in Rome, Italy where I used to live for many years.  The amount of olive oil used (no butter here!) in the preparation was perfectly authentic Italian.   In addition, we ordered a Margherita pizza and we loved that too.  It was thin, light and crunchy, NOT like a thick sloppy wet mess of a Neopolitan style.  The tomato sauce was sweet and delicious and the fior di latte cheese was real and delicate.  We love this gem and will be regulars from now on!! My husband particularly likes the patio chairs (Italian made) - comfy and sturdy."}
{"text":"Just ordered fettuci alfredo and gnocchi from foodora and its the shittiest pasta I have ever had. It has no salt, no flavour, and the cream sauce was disgusting.  I changed my rating from 1 to 3 only because of customer service. I got a call from the restaurant 2 hours later after I posted this review apologizing for the bad experience. I am glad to know they care about customers and atleast make an effort. I am just sad that i wasted $50 on two pastas that are not even worth eating. It would have been nice if they provided refund or a gift voucher."}
{"text":"Great location and neighborhood. Place is beautifully designer with navy blue velvet banquettes and a great outdoor patio. I had a panini that took me back to my days in Italy. Overall great spot for a friendly beer or apperitivo after work, before dinner or all night."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really enjoy going to Corvo, especially on nice summer days for the patio. We have a 1 year old beagle that we take to the dog park across the street and when we want to have dinner, we bring her into the patio instead of having to bring her home. The staff is accommodating and always brings her a nice bowl of fresh water.  We usually order the pastas and a house bottle of red and it's yummy. The whole vibe is very chill, they put up cute patio lights, have nice music in the background, and there's many trees around us, it felt like being in a cute little wine bar in Italy!  Also the customer service is great, the owner came out to make sure our food was good and the waitresses came to check on us and refill our beverages. I definitely recommend visiting in person for food and a drinks in the summer especially with your lovely furry friend!  By the way, I wouldn't say it's $$$$. It's more like $$ - most of the food is under $30."}
{"text":"So, I just ordered Corvo for the first time.  I got the Margarita pizza and the sausage rapini pasta.  In fact, the only reason I rated the order 2 stars was because the pasta is edible.  However - the pizza is a different story.   I opened the pizza box expecting to find a Neapolitan style margarita pizza that included ingredients as described on their menu (tomato sauce, fior di latte, and fresh basil).  The first thing I noticed was that there wasn't any basil - annoying, but I'll live.  The second thing I noticed was how pale and doughy the entire pizza looked.  However, I thought that it can't be that bad and I have nothing else to eat at this point (it's 10:15 pm on a Wednesday).  Let me tell you I was WRONG.  This pizza is an under cooked, disgusting mess.  The crust is raw, and the cheese is barely melted, even the flavour itself is bland - it's just bad.  Currently, I am heating up my oven so I can cook they rest of this pizza, and salvage something of this meal.   Again the pasta is meh...I was going to save it for lunch tomorrow, but I am too hungry to wait for this pizza to cook.  You really have to season the pasta yourself because flavour is bland. But again between the pasta and the pizza I can - with some doctoring from my spice cabinet -  at least eat the pasta.   I literally created a Yelp account tonight to write this review because I turn to Yelp often when I am trying new foods and really trust the reviews, and I feel that perhaps this place is better as a \"dine-in\" experience otherwise I don't understand it's positive rating.  I just also wanted to add that I have had many margarita pizza's and pasta's from various Italian eateries in the city (I live right downtown and work downtown as well) - Just to let everyone know that this isn't my first time having this style of pizza."}
