{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Love the atmosphere and the burger was out of this world!"}
{"text":"The place is not fully operating as of yet as there are some renovations that are still under way.  I stopped into this place to grab a coffee and some free WIFI.  The owner was very pleasant and seems very knowledgable in the restaurant industry.  The coffee and service was great and it was nice to not be rushed.  It has a nice/quaint atmosphere.  There are lot of windows and space.  I look forward to coming back when it's in full operations.  I will probably be back for another coffee!  Would recommend people to stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food and drinks there. Too bad it closed down.

The chef is a friendly and knowledgeable so wherever he is, he will make his customers very happy."}
