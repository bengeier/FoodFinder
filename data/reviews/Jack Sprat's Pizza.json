{"text":"When you first see it. It looks like a shady corner store but the pizza is excellent.  I recommend the the vegetarian white pizza.   OMG you get huge chunks of veggies and you wonder how they stay on.  Well I'll tell you with layer upon layer of cheese.  The sauce is excellent. Fir you meat Eaters, you'll have to come and see for yourself but i cant imagine it would be any less than delicious. It's a bit pricey but so worth it.  And the guys there are friendly.  Don't judge this place by the look, I promise you'll miss out."}
{"text":"If you want low grade cheap hamburger and  and poor service then this is your place.  I wasted $16 on a burger and wings. The wings were not even cooked in the sauce. All I can say is run far from this place! The only good item was the  canned soda. What a shame! They don't deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"This is over-priced really bad pizza. I feel like almost all pizza is good but this place almost proved the theory wrong that even even bad pizza is good. I wouldn't recommend this place at all and the prices are ridiculous, especially after walking in and looking at the inside of this dump. Sorry not sorry."}
{"text":"You can get pizza and anything you else could imagine at this place. It's a classic Bodega style business."}
{"text":"What this place lacks in curb appeal it makes up for in taste. If you're looking for a NYC style bodega, it doesn't get more convenient than Jack Spratt's. They even deliver. I usually do the meatball sub, or the white pizza is out of this world. Great wings too..."}
