{"text":"Went to buy smoked salmon to take home.  Staff was super friendly and made recommendations and gave samples.  Smoked salmon was delicious and they were many different kinds.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The chub chub will change your life. I may or may not have licked the fish spread off the wrapper... It was that good.   Also, the guys there are SUPER friendly and helpful.  If you like smoked fish, cream cheese, and bagels you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place. Pretty much go every weekend and the value is great. I was never a fan of smoked salmon until I found this place. I usually go for a gravlax which is a little less smoky and their house made pickled toppings are perfect."}
{"text":"Sort of a hidden gem on DuPont. If you didn't know you probably drove past it many times. Fantastic bagel sandwiches. All the smoked fish and chopped salads look so good. Any one of their creations will satisfy your bagel cravings."}
{"text":"This is my go-to bagel spot in the city. My only criticisms are that the layer of cream cheese they give you is too thin and it is a little overpriced, but everything that Anthony Rose owns is."}
{"text":"Great quick and easy joint for bagels, sandwiches, and the like."}
{"text":"Some of the best white fish salad that I have ever had.  The rapini salad, eggplant dip, chopped liver, and lox were very good as well.  Sandwiches were also available but keep in mind that Schmaltz is very small and only available for take out.  Service was great and were extremely patient and knowledgable about their offerings.  Some cookies, donuts, and other sweets available too."}
{"text":"Tasty smoked salmon (I'm usually not a big fan) and tasty cream cheese. Bagels are think and more B ready then I expected but make for above sandwich."}
{"text":"Had the best sammy here the other day! I byob-ed (build-your-own-bagel), and ordered up a toasted everything bagel with horseradish cream cheese, beet-cured gravlax, red onion, capers and a sprinkle of black pepper. Walked over to Christie Pits, sat down and opened up the most photogenic sandwich ever. The bright beet gravlax was delectable, with an earthy element and I loved the combo of ingredients... whoever thought of that is a genius.    Yes, this place is certainly pricey when you consider single sandwich vs. purchasing all the goods yourselves. But, they are pulling out all the stops with the specialty options like pastrami-style smoked salmon and lemon-dill gravlax. It feels worth it. Bite into it."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite bagel spot in not only Toronto, but also in Canada. I've been to Paramount and St-Viatuer in Montreal (and even a few in New York City for good measure) and Schmaltz's tops then all. The pumpernickel, pastrami smoked salmon bagel was hands down the best. The smoke salmon was nicely smoke and seasoned with a delicious rub. The pumpernickel bagel was dense, but also still very soft and nicely complimentary to the smoked salmon. I also tried the sesame bagel, which was good, but the pumpernickel is the way to go."}
{"text":"Gather around lil' kids. The old man is about to tell a story  This is Customer Service (read to the end to understand)  I visit Schmaltz Appetizing last weekend and BOY i was excited. Ive been on a lox cream cheese bagel trip for the last few weeks mmmmmmmmmmmmm hallelujiah.  My girlfriend told me we should go there since its own by the same people as Fat Pasha and we had such a lovely time there, great food and customer service.  Well...  Ive experienced the worst customer service of my life.  But first. The bagel was splendid. That bagel was $12 and well, it was worth it. The richness of the salmon. out of this world. You know when you eat something savoury that is so good it feels like you are eating desserts. Mmmm delicious amazing.  Unfortunately this bagel was served with rudeness and frustration over things i cant control and a general negative vibe.   I went to talk to the manager and as soon as she saw i had a bad experience, she took me aside, and ask me what happened. I want to personally congrats courtney for her devotion to excellence, taking action, caring about the experience of her guests and going above and beyong to make this right. This is the kind of people we need running restaurant, retail store or any customer facing business. This is the winning attitude. I was quite done with the bagel place before i talk to courtney and well she was so caring for the experience that happened in her restaurant, she didnt wait or find excuses, she apologies and fix the issue.   Courtney, thank you so much for your commitment to excellence, i will see you soon for more bagels and hummus, because this is how loyaulty is created. Not when everything goes right, but when something goes wrong, but the people make it right for you, because then you know, they care."}
{"text":"Terrific bagel sandwich.  I have been to Fat Pasha a few times and loved it, so I was excited to hear about this place.  Stopped by for a sandwich and a juice for lunch because I was working from home today.  Outstanding.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the bagel sandwiches! I once had an amazing customized bagel with their smoked herring (which I am a total fan of). Their chub chub bagel is one of their best sellers and I can see why. The smoked salmon and the light cream cheese with the addition of pickled cucumbers... mmmm. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Whenever we're in the area, my fianc√© and I always make an effort to drop in since it's the only place in the GTA that we're aware of that dedicates themselves to smoked fish bagel sandwiches!   The last time we came here, we sat out back on the patio and one of the guys setting up for dinner was really nice and gave us some water and extra napkins! The staff here want to make your experience as best it can be and will give you suggestions if you're totally lost with their menu."}
{"text":"After thoroughly enjoying our bagel sandwiches, I was getting ready to post my review on Yelp and For a second I was confused because the picture I took was already uploaded...or so I thought. I quickly realized that a common way to enjoy Schmaltz is in the car with food on your lap. There is little space in this take out joint and most customers are taking things on the go. The food was great. My wife had the popular chub chub sandwich and I had the chazzer (pastrami style salmon), $9 and $10 each. Had a bit of sticker shock but they were both solid sandwiches.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable and I really enjoyed their coffee. I wonder if prices would be lower if they smoked their own salmon and baled their own bread. Pretty much everything is outsourced except for the whitefish which was tasty. Overall, a tasty treat if you're in the mood. Yelp average of 3.5 stars is about right."}
{"text":"I LOOOOVE SMOKED SALMON AND LOOOOVE CREAM CHEESE BAGELS! What better place to have it at than here! There are a good selection of smoked/cured fish and 3 types of cream cheese (all that probably taste wonderful). If I could come here everyday to have the smoked/cured fish and try every single one I would!  I had the Nova Lox bagel (don't recall the name on the menu) but it was juuuust awesoooooome! LITERALLY yummy in my tummy! When things are yummy I could have 2 of them...and I wish I did but let's not get too carried away now :P  Service was swift and friendly which is great if you are a grab-and-go kind of style person. They also have like a points-like card where after buying a certain number of bagels you get something at the end so be sure to start one up!  They also do have a place to sit next to the shop that is like an outdoor patio if you wanna gobble the bagel up before going on your way.  Well what are you waiting for? Go indulge those smoked/cured fish and bagel senses!"}
{"text":"Such friendly service every time and DELICIOUS fish options. They are knowledgeable and passionate about smoked fish, cream cheese, and bagels. If that's what your looking for then this place will not disappoint. Also don't forget to get your schaltmz card stamped!"}
{"text":"Went for take out on a hot Saturday.  The gentleman behind the counter was friendly, immediately offering to explain things to us.  We ended up deciding to split a chub chub on a toasted poppy seed bagel, and a chazzer on a toasted everything bagel.  We were never offered options of adding additional items (onions, tomatoes, etc) to these bagels so I'm not sure if they offer that or not; they sort of rushed us to pay while the dude finished making our bagels.  They don't have any still water in their fridge, so we shared a sparkling water.  We were stupid and ended up sitting on a lone bench outside, but learned AFTER eating our meals that there is actually patio seating specifically for Schmaltz, so don't be like us.  Be better.  The bagels were really good.  First, I hate bagels.  So for me to say that is a big deal.  They weren't too heavy and the toast was light, which I appreciate because...I also hate toasted bread.  I'm the worst.  Anyway, they were good.  I preferred the everything bagel which surprised me because I'm usually a traditional poppyseed kind of girl.    We started with the chub chub.  My dining companion felt like he got less lox (beet lox!) in his half, but I think that's because he also didn't realize there is whitefish in there.  It certainly isn't a ton of lox.  However, I still really enjoyed it.    Next, the chazzer.  At first we were going to get pastrami lox w cream cheese, but for a dollar extra you can get roe.  I LOVE ROE.  For those of you that don't know, roe is fish eggs, and these were the big, beautiful, ikura kind.  OMG this was a beautiful thing.  I absolutely loved this bagel.  All in all, I would definitely be back for take out of either pre-made food or food to assemble at home."}
{"text":"The guy with the beard and tattoo up the left side of his neck behind the counter is among the rudest individuals I've ever met in customer service - pompous prick. The food was great but this guy shouldn't be dealing with customers...ever"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place because of all the great reviews on the bagels and lox. When we arrived, the exterior had what we assumed would be a great, peaceful vibe. However, I wouldn't recommend this place solely on the customer service. They were rude, and rushed our order, without bothering to explain the options, or making any recommendations. When we asked them what the choices were, the answers were rushed and quite curt.  For the food, Bagel was a little on the stale side, and it couldn't be made better with the average-tasting cream cheese, though the salmon was decent."}
{"text":"The food scene on Dupont keeps on getting better and better every year.   I do agree with Mark H's comments about the ingredients inside the bagel surpassing the actual bagel - there is definitely room for improvement here. Yet I want to express my gratitude for having a deli spot in the hood, even a small one, that offers good fish, latkes, pickles, rugelach, blintzes, and other delights. They also do catering.   Thanks, Mr. Rose! Ms. Baker looks forward to Bar Begonia and the backyard bocce court.  Update: The bagels are brought in daily from Kivas and if you get them while they're fresh, they are great!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and I am very happy with it. The bagels are delicious, the guy working at the front counter is very friendly, knowledgable about his product and funny. He made the experience for me and my boyfriend. Also got to taste test 2 of the types of lox which was very helpful in deciding.   The pricing is okay but the product is worth paying for, around $10 a sandwich which is fairly average.   We also tried thier potato latkes which were a delicious appetizer and served warm.   My boyfriend got the beet lox and I got the pastrami. We also got the cold pressed coffee, an interesting drink. Overall would recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Food was horrid.  I tried to scrape the fish and liver off the bagels.  Simply to salvage something from my 36 cad order.  But it must have sat for a bit as the flavours had seeped into bagels.    It was awful ... I'm not being dramatic when I say it made me. gag.    Pickles and chips were good  Don't waste your money.  This food is so bad....  ack !!"}
{"text":"I have tried the whitefish bagel and absolutely loved it. Found for lunch it was hefty enough to share with a colleague with some latkes on the side. DELISH! I also have tried the bagel with plain cream cheese and it was fine as well. Looking forward to returning for the smoked salmon. Havent tried it yet but based on the reviews, it may even trump the whitefish. Hard to imagine!"}
{"text":"Holy mother of bagels and smoked salmon - this is delicious!!   I ordered the Chazzer for today. Had it on pumpernickel. As soon as I had my first bite, I fell in love. The salmon roe popped in my mouth. The salmon was so rich and tasty. The horseradish cream cheese scared me because of the name. But I really enjoyed it as it melded with all the flavours.   The women who worked there this morning were friendly.   I got some salmon and pickled beets to bring home. It won't last me too long!  I'll definitely come back a lot more often than I want to due to my salmon addiction.  P.S. It's not pronounced Chaz-zer. More like Khazzer. I felt pretty silly when I heard them pronounce it the right way!"}
{"text":"First time here yesterday and really emote it.  As a first timer I ordered the 'Chub chub', the most popular item on the menu. It's a toasted bagel with gravlax smoked salmon, whitefish, some sort of pickled cucumber and horseradish cream cheese.   It was truly delicious. I don't know if I've ever had that kind of smoke salmon. It had some sort of red seasoning on the outside. Looked beautiful as the guy was slicing it for the sandwich. Pickles were great in there too.   Was about $10, standard ish for a good sandwich. Service was quick and staff were nice.  For me it's a once in a while type of sandwich, but I really enjoyed it.   The other salmons/items looked great too; would definitely go back to try some other items"}
{"text":"Used to be a weekly staple but now there's new people who make the order take twice as long....hate when this happens to old favorites!"}
{"text":"I love their chopped liver bagel and latkes. Good food and excellent service. Not cheap but worth every dollar"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chub Chub, it was good but not mind blowingly amazing for the price. The bagel didn't taste fresh but the salmon and cream cheese mix was pretty good. I wouldn't make a trip specifically for the bagel but maybe i will have it again when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Yum this place is my dream come true. The deli person guided us and helped us choose from the menu. I have been twice now during the winter. Can't wait to stop by more as the weather heats up . the outdoor seating will be enjoyable"}
{"text":"I was feeling exceptionally lazy and our fridge was super empty on a holiday morning so I decided to order us some breakfast via Uber Eats (I recognize this to be ridiculous but my millennial self feels it was worth every penny lol).  We opted for a couple of bagels, a pickle and the bakermans square. Bagels were great - chewy and flavourful. The pickle was perfect, super sour (so good). The square was freaking incredible. Try it!!  Everything was totally delicious except they completely forgot my smoked salmon (stuff happens!) When I called, the gentleman was apologetic and said he would give me a credit for next time. He also kindly offered to deliver another bagel immediately but by this time I was starving so will be back to visit in person soon.  Looking forward to trying the salmon!"}
{"text":"Another one of the Rose and Sons properties dominating Dupont Street, Schmaltz Appetizing is tucked in an easily missable storefront behind Fat Pasha (and yet another from Anthony Rose), which reveals itself to be a decent gourmet lunch option in the area that lacks such a thing (if you attend the nearby GBC campus, yeah, there's very little in terms of good food places in the area thus far). The tiny takeout shop lacks seating of any kind, save for maybe the patio shared with Fat Pasha.  I'm not much a fan of bagels, never mind bagel sandwiches. But even if you absolutely hate bagels, it makes no difference what kind of bagel you choose, because the things they put in it to make your sandwich will own the whole meal and make you forget it's all held in place by two halves of a damned bagel. Watch as fresh fish gets sliced to make your sandwich, then watch as you salivate with each bite! Certainly worth a visit if you're in the area to check out.  There are simpler and customizable options with your choice of fish, or not even. Predesigned schmaltz bagel sandwich choices are definitely a go-to for those who can't think. The Chazzer ($10) oozes goodness with the horseradish cream cheese and spillover of salmon roe caviar, all while the gravlax slices seals the experience. The Chub Chub ($9) is decent too with the pickle-y taste of dill adding savoury flavour.  {TTC: 26 bus to Howland, or a short walk west from Dupont subway station}"}
{"text":"Last morning in Toronto, and was craving a good bagel. After reading several reviews of other places, decided on this here delicious place. Good Things come in small packages. Originally ordered the chub chub which was great!  Also sampled a bite of the tuna fish on a bagel which was simple but very flavorful. We sat in the car and tried the bagels, didn't finish what we ordered and went back to get some spreads to go. Definitely worth the 30 minute drive out of the way back to Philly. Try tho place if you're looking for great tasting bagels!    They are pretty pricey, and I think their menu needs updating in regards to prices because our order came to $29 for two bagels and two cold drinks."}
{"text":"My sole reason of venturing into the Dupont neighbourhood was for this cute little joint! (Will definitely be returning). My friend heard that they have one of the best bagels in town, and boy-oh-boy was that so true.  My friend and I both had the Chub-Chub. It's a smoked whitefish salad, gravlax horseradish cream cheese with dill cucumber. I chose their everything bagel because they ran out of poppy seed :'(   We also had the Latkes which was very delicious and served warm!   I also had the Rugelach, which unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of. The presentation was great but, it's probably just not my cup of tea.   I definitely will be coming back and potentially try everything they have, because everything sounded so delicious (and also to try that poppy seed bagel)!"}
{"text":"Ethereal Smoked Fish As a lifelong lover of fish, I am always looking for another and innovative offering. Schmaltz is just that place. Primarily because they smoke fish onsite but in ways, you probably haven't tried before. Two standouts from my visit were the lemon dill and beetroot infused smoked salmon ($10.99 w. a shmear of cream cheese on a bagel).  Their bagels are sourced from Toronto icon: Kiva's. Which don't produce my definition of a bagel. Montreal bagels are the real thing! However, they are baked daily and you'd be hard-pressed to find fresher ones.  The location not so easy to find! But persist as they have a DuPont street address but you enter off of Bathurst."}
{"text":"Anthony Rose is on a roll.  His latest -- a small shop behind his Fat Pasha restaurant -- offers some of the best smoked fish I've had in Toronto.  It's all takeout, and we brought home the whitefish salad and the \"pastrami\" smoked salmon.  Both were superb, with the former characterized by just the right amount of mayonnaise and nice chunks and flakes of high quality whitefish.  The latter was a strong smoke flavoured beautifully textured (and cut) salmon.  We also had the pickles -- great crunch! -- and the rugeleh.  There was no real wait, and the server was friendly and knowledgable.  I note they also have interesting bagel combinations that they will make up -- for instance chopped liver and gribenes -- but I am a purist when it comes to deli, so we laid out our platter at home with the classic fixings."}
{"text":"Easily the best BAGEL place in the 6ix. The same owners of Fat Pasha however they really did a great job with this place. You gotta try the different bagels each time you go. I loved the Chubb Hubb!"}
{"text":"Was greeted as soon as we walked in and both gentlemen at the counter were friendly enough to explain what they offered and their preferences. Bagel itself was great, would definitely recommend the Chub Chub as its full of flavour and I love whitefish. Also, would choose everything bagel over poppyseed bagel. Would def come back, we saw the patio beside this joint but wasn't sure if it was for the restaurant next door. After reading will have to check it out next time! $20+ for 2 bagels"}
{"text":"Love this place. We have been coming since it opened (back before they adjusted the prices - when a bagel could cost you $16). Love walking in for a coffee, a chub chub bagel, a rugelach or a warm donut in the morning. The portions are massive and delicious. The staff is so friendly and patient! Fantastic stuff."}
{"text":"This place is a takeout joint with patio seating in the back that they share with fat pasha customers. A 3.5 for me.  Essentially a lox and bagel place that resembles some of the Jewish New York ones I used to go to when I lived there. The fish was very good but my main knock is that the bagels are pretty average. They're very doughy and thick bagels. They're not really chewy but more like dense bread. I suppose this is good for sandwich purposes to keep everything together.   The counter people and cashier were both very nice. They were helpful and helped us pick our bagels.   Two of their speciality bagels came out to be about $22 which is decent. I would come back for another sandwich. Not sure if they even sell bagels by itself but it's definitely not the place for it."}
{"text":"Run, don't walk to this unimaginable temple of heavenly smoked fish and shmears. First you'll arrive to find an unassuming store front, little do you know the magic that is underway within. Next you'll get a proper greeting by the staff that clearly doesn't work here for the job but rather the passion they possess to bring you into their world of what they love and only want to open your mind up to. After sampling a bite of some of the most delicious flavors you've ever experienced, you'll select a bagel with a shmear and choose from and incredible array of smoked or cured fishes to ultimately build your dream bagel. Word of advise, take the staffs recommendations on what to order, you find it outside of your comfort zone, but trust me, they know what they're doing. The pastrami cured salmon is not to be missed and don't forget to order a few pickles, it brings it all together, and for some of us, a comfort food experience on steroids."}
{"text":"Decent, but a little steep in price. Didn't get much salmon on my sandwich. Only good to try once. Good taste otherwise.. Bagel is very stiff as well."}
{"text":"After living in NYC for 10 years, and frequenting all the hot bagel places, I know good lox and bagels when I have them. The bagel was small, and left much to be desired. The salmon and toppings were delicious though, but it did not make up for the poor service, and lack of professionalism. The guy who worked behind the counter was pompous and rude. A lox snob if you will. He was patronizing and condescending when we asked questions about the different bagels, as if we should have fully understood each and every menu ingredient before even stepping foot inside.  I would never go back to a place where they treat the customers this way, no matter how good they think their food is."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chazzer and the Chop chop. Their horseradish cream cheese is delightful. They carry lox marinated in beetroot, lemon-dill, pastrami-smoked style lox.   There's a small patio on the side of their store where you can sit and enjoy your bagel. They're also opening a new location on Dundas."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bagel and lox I've had. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because 1) it's always busy so the line is out the door and 2) if you get there too late, especially on the weekend, they won't have any fish left for the bagel sandwiches. Still unreal and fresh - plus it's local and family run which is great!"}
{"text":"The customer is always wrong. We were fairly regular customers. My wife just got home after trying to pick up bagels, salmon, and cream cheese for our Yom Kippur break fast dinner. She was told they were only selling sandwiches. They literally refused to sell the same thing not in stacked form (hey: we're trying to save you guys the labor!). They told her they \"didn't want to disappoint people later.\" Um, guys, you disappointed the customer standing in the store, so I hope these people who haven't arrived yet are especially happy. If the owners are not buying enough food to serve your customers, whose fault is that? Anyway, we won't be going back. There's a great, new, friendly smoked salmon place on St. Clair West, and I think they'll be getting our business from now on."}
{"text":"We used to love schmaltz and would go out of our way to make sure we got our weekly smoked salmon there. The service was incredible with a focus on education, the product was delicious and the prices were reasonable. Unfortunately after a summer away we find this has all changed. Our experience this morning was disappointing to say the least. Service was lacklustre and uninformed. The salmon was cut thicker then my steak last night and multiple types of salmon were all packaged together making it more difficult to keep. The prices are now uncompetitive with other options, especially given the disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I came all the way from the east end to give the Maven bagel a try. It is amazing so fresh and so filling! If you love smoked salmon you have to give this place a go."}
{"text":"I love the idea of a place nearly entirely dedicated to bagels and lox.  Given that this has to be one of my favourite meals on the planet, I welcome the idea.  This is take out, and the quality of the salmon offered was exceptionally good.  I hear complaints about the price but for the variety and quality offered I think it is fair.  It also happens to be pretty cool to watch the salmon be cut right in front of you.  On the day I visited there was  beat soaked salmon that wasn't smoked and a Wolfhead smoked option.    My biggest disappointment is the bagel itself.  To be fair, I set the standard against Montreal bagels but if they had a bagel of that quality... I can't imagine how often I would be here.  As it is, the bagel is OK.  It is clear that it isn't made on site and was somewhat stale.  If they landed that, the line would be an hour long rather than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot for bagels and schmear! These lox, schmears, and bagels thoroughly impressed me, and I'm a lifelong New Yorker! Schmaltz's is off the corner of Dupont, and offers a variety of lox and smoked fish. I really enjoyed my nova lox, and the seasoning on the pastrami lox was excellent. The bagels were crispy on the outside, and nice and fluffy on the inside. And, thank the lord, they are generous with the cream cheese here, and their coffee is quite good for a deli (a place that doesn't specialize in coffee, per se). But best of all was the service. Everyone at Schmaltz's when I visited was warm, kind, and more than happy to talk through the menu. All in all a lovely addition to the Toronto culinary landscape."}
