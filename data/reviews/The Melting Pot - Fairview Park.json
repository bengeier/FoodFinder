{"text":"Went for Valentine's.  Everyone was polite and attentive.  Our server Mike gave us some great unsolicited suggestions that made our night that much better."}
{"text":"Great place for adults and kids! We love coming here. Good food, great service, attentive staff! Great for birthday dinners too! Also vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Last night was mine & my fiances first time visiting, and it was awesome! I've always heard great things about The Melting Pot. What made our experience even better was our server David. He was fun to joke around with and he was very knowledgeable about the menu. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food is always great here, fresh and tasty.  Because I have had Weight Loss Surgery, I asked Michael to put us on a slow track for the courses. His mother had also had WLS so he understood what I was trying to do and accommodated us with no problems. With WLS, the slower I eat the more I can eat and because Michael understood this, I got to enjoy both my cheese and chocolate course! :-)  

Melting Pot is a great place for WLS patients to eat.  Lots of flexibility with portions and , yes, you can take home leftover entr√©e components!!"}
{"text":"Service was average. Fun experience. Food was good. Pricey for having to cook your own food."}
{"text":"Stopped by Melting Pot tonight at 630 after shopping, was told by host and hostess that they were committed until 730 because they scheduled for a typical Wednesday night. They didn't have enough servers we were told. The Wednesday before Christmas? Management should take a good look at the schedule for the rest of the holiday season and make sure you are staffed properly.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate our anniversaries with another couple. Had a very private booth. Service was very good, nice ambience, and I was comfortable wearing jeans, a blazer and accessories to dress it up. We ordered the \"Four Course Classic.\" Fondue was great and food was good, just very skimpy portions. For example, on the platter of offerings for the main course, there were 3 tiny pieces of chicken, and 4 shrimp with additionally small servings of tuna and steak. If you cooked everything on the platter at once, and served it all together, it would not be enough food for two people to share. The offerings with the cheese fondue were adequate, but the bread cubes were stale. The salads were good as well as the dressings and condiments. The desert offerings were the worst. 4 thin slices of mushy banana, a few slices of strawberry (not even whole), a tiny piece of cheesecake, tiny squares of stale pound cake and brownies, tiny rice krispy squares and 3 or 4 marshmallows. It was not worth the price we paid. But to be fair, I would go back again and order ala carte, just to see if the portions are better. I would say this place is definitely for special occassions where you can take your time and enjoy cooking and sharing your food with your dining companions. Allow at least 2 hours. Even though it is probably hard to judge the amount of food to serve in order to avoid waste, they do need to add a little more and up the quality of the desert offerings for sure -  think how happy customers would be to end the experience on a big piece of cheesecake!  That just makes everything \"all better!\""}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my husband a couple weeks ago. We got there after work, it was about 4:30. It seemed like we were the only people there for a while. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and the four course dinner. The food was fine as usual, typical overpriced fondue. As we were leaving(after being there for 3 hours), a manager and hostess were standing at the front. They said goodbye to us,then we heard one of them say, \"They are both sauced!\"
How unprofessional!!! We each had 3 drinks and a pretty big meal in the 3 hours that we were there. We were not \"sauced\". We will not be back. At least wait until we are out the door before you talk about us! I wonder what they have said about other people in their restaurant. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"It's a good place to go at least once.  It was a nice experience.  I give the atmosphere 5 stars, especially if you're looking for a quiet, romantic setting. 

 I give the food 3 stars...the food was good, not fabulous, but in my opinion a little overpriced, and that's why I say 3 stars.  We got the 4 course meal and the portions were the perfect size.  Not too big, not too small.  We left feeling full and taking nothing home, which is exactly how I like it!  

I'd give the service 3 stars.  The server was polite and professional and offered good suggestions, but service was a bit slow at times.  We were there about 2.5 hours (just two of us).  Perfect if you're just getting to know someone and have a lot to talk about, but a little too much time for my husband and I, who have been married a while.  

Our check was $100, and that was with no alcoholic beverages.  It was a cool thing to do once, but in the future we may end up getting a fondue set and doing this all at home.  :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here today for lunch.  We frequent The Melting Pot restaurants often when we are on vacation.  We were visiting the Cleveland area today and so we tried this location.  Our sever was Jacqui and she was phenomenal.  She was very friendly.  She offered great suggestions and was the right amount of attentive.  We had the French Onion Soup inspired cheese, a salad (Cesar and House) and for the entree we had the chicken and the chicken potstickers.  Everything was wonderful.  The French Onion Soup inspired cheese is definitely my new favorite cheese course!!!!  The only downside of our meal was the size of the salad.  The size of the salad is smaller than it used to be but it is not any cheaper.  We chose not to get the chocolate today but Jacqui brought us a pair of their chocolate covered strawberries with a sparkler and she took the time to write out \"safe travels\" in chocolate on the plate.  We have been to a lot of Melting Pots but we have never had better service than we did today.  Thanks Jacqui!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come here often. Food is great atmosphere is great. Private if you like also. Happy hour 4-7pm. Is great. Prices are reasonable for upscale dinning."}
{"text":"\"Lyndsey was absolutely phenomenal. She was knowledgable, friendly, and helpul. Tods, the manager, even made a special visit to our table at the end of the night to double check on us. We truly appreciate the *b*tchin service we continually receive from the staff at this location. Keep up the great work Lyndsey!!! :)\""}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre.   Ther are great fondue restaurants out there- this is not one of them.  Went here for a birthday celebration. Even though it was a Wednesday and the place was almost empty we had to wait 5 mins to be seated.  We were lead through a DARK room and seated.  Waitress left menu and was go e for another 10 mins....it was so dark I had to use my phone light to read the menu.  We ordered and were surprised at the small portions.  The bread and chips wer a bit stale with our chees and the salad was non descript.  Our wiatress was unattentive, and the only time we saw her was when she brought food.  Never checked on us to see if we needed anything or a drink refill.  I was hesitant to order an entree but got the chicken.   Waitress said it took 2 mins to cook-WHAT!!!!  WHO eats raw chicken???? It took more like 15 mins and I was still afraid I would get salmonella.    We passed on dessert.. $90 for two crappy dinners and one drink is ridiculous- the food would have been better at Wild Wings around the corner.   NOWI know why THEY had a huge crowd while this place was empty.    Avoid unless you like to over pay for crappy food and service"}
{"text":"I had an excellent experience here! Our server was really good, fast and attentive, he was friendly and even gave us the password to the wifi (which is sadly not free) so I could download a fondue timer on my phone. I thought that was fun. Going to eat here is definitely time consuming. We were there for almost 3 hours since you cook most of the food yourself as it is brought to you table side. But it was cool to get each piece in courses. A real adventure if you are looking for something different. It was costly as well, not something you could regularly, but I would go back with a group for sure."}
{"text":"Came in an hour before close. Staff acted like it was the end of the world. Each person treated us with a terrible attitude. Original chocolate was dumped on the table with giant scoop of peanut butter unstirred. I asked waitress if they usually stir that. She said \"you can\" and walked away. There were no marshmallows or crispie treats on our plates either.
Update: Manager Todd apologized for the wait staff and made us feel much better about our experience."}
{"text":"This place..... IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! made a 7:30 reservation. At first we were told it was a 15 min wait. Ok no big deal. We get seated..... our first time here, place beverage orders and get waters....... we were disappointed that it took 20 minutes to get our actual drinks and place our order however the wait was very much worth it. The food and the experience was amazing. Waitress was very friendly, food was fantastic. Flavors were excellent and paired well with different dips. Adult drinks were great (a little overpriced but what they hay!) Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food is always very good but the service isn't. Last night, we waited more than 10 minutes in the lobby and never once saw a hostess. Another couple was behind us and we both discussed leaving. Finally I went into the other room and explained to the bartender how long we had been waiting and he found our host - who never once apologized. Same with our waiter - he was so nice but the restaurant wasn't full and it took forever for him to take our order. Just a long process."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, atmosphere and our server Karen was one of the best we've ever had.  It was a great experience for our first time there and we had the 4-course dinner and were so full we could not eat the dessert course so they were kind enough to give us a card to return some other day for the dessert.  Very considerate and wonderful plus when Karen asked if we were celebrating anything we said both our birthdays were this month and at the end of dinner before we left we got two chocolate covered strawberries with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate and two candles lite and Karen even sang to us.  GREAT NIGHT and GREAT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Melting Pot. It's not BAD, but (for me) it's a novelty and not a place to which I need to return. I've been to this Melting Pot a few times - most recently I went because someone gave me a gift card. 

The service at this location has always been excellent, although it's somewhat formal and rehearsed sounding as the waitstaff will explain in detail the menu and what they're doing when they're making the fondue at the table. But the waitstaff has been quite good, attentive, and friendly. 

It's a big space with lots of tables/booths. The booths have high backs so the tables are somewhat private. I think it's mostly 4 tops with one fondue burner, or 6 tops with 2 fondue burners. This Melting Pot is dimly lit, which is fine if you're hoping for romance, I guess, but if it's just friends or family or something, it's weird and unnecessarily dark. The music piped through the restaurant was solely 90's slow jams and love songs. 

Melting Pot is $$$$ if you are getting some booze and the 4 course meal: appetizer, salad, entree and dessert. For me, the cost is not justified by the quality. It is not fine dining. The cheese fondue is decent, but never something that we've been all \"Oh my God, this is amazing, I want more\" good. For me to be ambivalent about cheese says a lot. They give you broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, bread, and tortilla chips for dipping. The salads were decent. I am not a big fan of the entrees. Whatever you cook in the fondue (fish, chicken, steak, etc.) has little or no flavor so you have to rely on a variety of dipping sauces to flavor your entree. If you're there with a group of people, there's a ton of fondue forks in the pot, and half of the stuff falls off the fondue fork, and then is overcooked by the time you fish it out. The chocolate dessert fondue is also decent. They provide you with a selection of tiny items for dipping - banana slices, brownie bites, rice krispie treats, marshmallows, angel food cake bites, and a few strawberries.  

If you're doing the 4 course thing, it takes up a large amount of time.

This is 2.5 stars for me. It's not bad, but for the $$, it's not good enough."}
{"text":"What a disappointment and so very over priced. Appetizer: fine but complete rip off. $30 for cheese fondue that was bland.  Main course: meats were not of good quality,  and the sauces were just awful.  Did not do dessert. Atmosphere was dark and dull, table was at some weird right angle. Total was $130, and we just had water to drink. I certainly would not return or recommend this for any occasion."}
{"text":"Service -- Indescribably EXCELLENT -- Karen H is a Pro she contributed to both the enjoyment of the experience and the meal -- we were overwhelmed by her Excellent Service and can't say enough and asked to speak to the Restaurant Management to advise them of their good fortune -- to our surprise this young woman was only on the job three days!  With her sincere attitude and attention to her customers she will be successful wherever she works.  Hope The Melting Pot appreciates its talent you can't buy that kind of sincerity.  It is so refreshing to want to write such a positive review about anything anymore but that only goes to show you what a positive experience provides...Food was good too --  much more affordable with a Groupon...Thank you for the setting to voice a Yelp."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Took over 15 minutes to get a glass of water.  Once we finally got some food, my salad was old brown lettuce.  I was over charged but since the waiter only came around every 20 minutes, it was taken out of his tip.  Horrible experience and will definitely not be going back."}
{"text":"Fondue is the most brilliant goddamned idea any restauranteur came up with.  \"Let's put burning hot grills on the table!\" someone said.  \"And then we'll charge them extra to cook their own food!\"  

Somewhere, there's a restaurant owner who's trying to figure out a way to charge you for eating in your own home.  There has to be a way.

That said, Melting Pot is actually a pretty decent fondue restaurant - it's just really, really pricey for the experience ($110 for a full meal with two drinks apiece for two people).  They do a good job from start to finish, with very attentive waiters, reasonably tasty food, and a good selection of things to dunk - but how much of that experience is the novelty?  Woo.  

I mean, I LOVE dunking stuff in cheese.  If I could, every meal would consist of a vat of boiling-hot liquid that I could plop stuff in and out of, including my ice cream and my glass of water.  Actually, my ideal restaurant would consist of a swimming-pool sized vat of boiling oil, where we'd stand at the edge of a cliff and huck turkeys and bags of potatoes into it, then rescue our meals later with swimming pool nets.  

Get on that, people. 

And Melting Pot is pretty upscale, with reasonably fine dining.  But it's not quite a fine dining experience, because it's a novelty factor and if you take the \"Hey, we're enjoying the communal pleasure of cooking together!\" then what you have are little bits of cheese and meats in little bits of sauces - all decent, but nothing really to match an actual coq au vin. 

If Melting Pot was less pricey - say, $20-$40 a person - then I'd give it four stars, no problem.  But as it is, what I'm being asked to pay for is a night out at the opera, when what I'm getting is a night out at an Oscar-winning movie at the Cedar Lee.  It's still good, and you feel appropriately snooty, but the tug on your wallet brings down the experience.

Which is to say that I think everyone should go here once.  It's cool, and the people are great.  And you should definitely try to wrangle your friends into going here on your birthday, when they're paying for it, since this is a ramped-up hibachi house.  It's a lot of fun, and gets incrementally better the more people you bring, BUT it also gets pricier.  

Or you could just cook in your kitchen.  But then you have to do your own dishes, and you don't get the thrill of having a guy stir cheese for you.  Your choice."}
{"text":"There are just some places you HAVE to go to, every once in a while, because you deserve it. I was treated by new friends to an experience I won't soon forget, especially due to the fact that someone is charging a fair amount you to cook your own food...and you don't mind at all:) 

I knew when I walked in the door to Melting Pot that this was not going to be my standard, sit down evening. Some friends, my Wife and I went there after a wedding I'd performed for them, and I'd heard this was not your usual fair. 

The atmosphere of Melting Pot is dark, intimate and uber-classy. They even have smaller alcove booths for those moments you want to impress and have a bit of privacy (please note all you young, and old, lovers out there:). In our case, with the size of our party, we were in a room that was festooned with party-goers (I think I counted at least two obvious birthday parties.) When the waiter/cookery expert said to us, \"I'll be here to serve you and facilitate your experience\" (paraphrasing), I knew this was going to be neat. 

The menu can be done several ways; you can order a four course tour-de-force, or just get one, like a dessert fondue. We had a cheese/veggie fondue thing at the start, salads next (BTW, best Caesar salad I've EVER had, but I think that was due to the candied pine nuts, mmmmmm.) The main course of various meats which you hot pot (cook yourselves) in a hot broth of various spice levels, and lastly, of course, various types of decadent chocolate, or non-chocolate, dessert fondues that will leave you full and spoiled as hell. 

The wait staff did a great job. Our glasses were filled, our needs met, and the management even came by and checked on us. We even had a staff MAGICIAN come by and do an illusion for us just for a final treat. 

Now, this ain't for everyone. The price is a bit steep at around 75-100 bucks a couple, BUT, this is not for a casual nosh; this is an...EXPERIENCE. You feel a sense of camaraderie and mutual partnership as you all have to agree on what things to get, and you have to have patience as you're all passing amongst each other and cooking your food, maintaining mutual conversation, and trying not to immerse one another in chocolate or cheese; it was fun:)

Also, their wine and drink list is great, and their martinis are AMAZING, with various creations that dazzled the eye as well as the palates of my fellow diners. 

Overall, a good experience, and I'd like to thank my friends who took us there; it was a great way to celebrate their nuptials, and a fine way  spend an evening with good company. I'd really give this a try folks, it ain't for everyone, but hey, EVERYONE should treat themselves. Give it a shot, I think it'll make your taste buds melt:)"}
{"text":"Expensive, small portions, and a long dinner time. Been to other fondue restaurants, and this one is WAY overpriced. $10 for about 1/2 cup of cheese. Complicated menu the way it's written. Got there at 5:30, left at 8:30, and it was NOT busy at all. Can make fondue at home for 1/5 the price. Took the family out and went with another couple. $260? So, yeah, none of us will  be coming back."}
{"text":"I was very excited to go there with my mom. We were both disappointed. The cheese fondue was good as were the salads. But the broth that was used to cook the meet had a funny taste. The meat tasted terrible after cooked so much we informed the manager on duty. She was very nice and did not make us pay for the remainder of the meal.  We shortly left after that and will not return. Also you cannot see the menu because of the dim lighting."}
{"text":"The main course was mediocre,  cheese and dessert great!! Place is filthy! Black mildew ring in toilet,  dust inch thick,  vent above our table was full of giant dust bunnies!"}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate my anniversary with my husband.  It was our first time dining at this restaurant.  We sat in the red room, which is located in the back with smaller, more private seating.  It was very cozy.  

We skipped the cheese fondue and went for salads and two entree selections.  I enjoyed taking the extra time to sit and relax with my husband while we were waiting for our food to cook.  It was a nice change as opposed to sitting down and eating without enjoying your meal because we are all too busy.

The highlight was the dessert fondue.  Dark chocolate with marshmallow and oreo crumbs! WOW! i could have skipped the meal all together and gone straight to dessert.  

It was a little pricey and not something we would do all the time but it was well worth the price for the quality time and good food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I go to The Melting Pot at least once a year for some sort of special occasion.  We always leave feeling very full and very satisfied.  So we went there last night for my birthday and had such a lovely time.  Our 3 kids are a bit loud/crazy so we warned our waiter (Allan) and he said no worries.  He was such an awesome waiter.  Very down to Earth and super funny.  He chatted with the kids and joked around with us/them.  He gave me a chocolate covered strawberry with a sparkler for my bday and I also got a gift bag filled with some goodies in it.  Overall, it was a lovely bday experience...mostly because of our awesome waiter Allan.  The food, as always, was super yummy too.  Highly recommend this location and, of course, Allan :-)"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO!!!!! unless you like sitting in a freezing restaurant.  When I complained about it to the girl, she said, \"I am not in charge of the ventilation system!!\" WTF are you kidding me! It had to be 60 degrees in there. Do not give me that crap when the burners on the whole place warms up.  Who in there right mind would sit in a restaurant for over 2 hours and freeze.  They would not even give me a table in a warmer spot.  Then to top it off, my party was a party of 4 so now you only get a table with one burner, party's of 5 or more get 2 burners.  If you been there before you know that sucks. The PLACE was EMPTY, they had no intentions of turning down the air conditioning or giving me a table with 2 burners so I left, will never, never go back.  And the waitress was a witch. Last time I was here I was over charged. I warned you!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can someone explain to me how this place is in business let alone a chain? I don't get it. I was at dinner for literally almost 3 hours on a Monday night and left smelling like fried, greasy food and completely unsatisfied. The highlight of the meal was the cheese course for sure, but why it is made table side, I have no idea. The scraping of the metal on metal at the waiter mixed it was killing me.  Maybe they wanted me to see how easy it is so I could go home, do it myself and never come back. 

The salads are crappy looking and not much in the taste department. The small assortment of meat they give you seems like quality, but when 4 people have to cook it while chatting, we had several casualties in the meat department. And what are those batters they give you? I'm sorry, but that is not tempura. They are thick and floury and just plain gross. We got more tempura stuck to the bottom of the sizzling pan than on the food. And he told us to dip everything in there. Huh? Why would I do that? It doesn't make sense. The oils were different temperatures and the cook times were a mess. 

The chocolate course had good desserts, but the chocolate was cold and tasted like Hershey's syrup from the can. 

The waitstaff was slow as molasses, also I suspect hired for looks instead of smarts which is always a disaster, our drinks were empty for ages at a time and I thought we were forgotten at one point. 

I love to spend money on food, but I can't figure out why people would shell out the good dollars to make their own mediocre meal. At least I can now say I have experienced Melting Pot and have no desire to again. 

BTW, has anyone seen the fondue cheese selection at trader joes? I'm going to make a loaf of bread with my fancy new bread maker (thanks BK) and cook up some fondue cheese from tj's and enjoy myself far more than I did last night."}
{"text":"The fondue was good but the cuts of meat are terrible. I expect a lot better for the price. The cheese, chocolate, and salad courses were very good and would have it again. The cheddar fondue and the classic chocolate were amazing. However, our waitress (Maddie) must've been having an off night. We ordered two drinks each throughout the meal and each took 20+minutes to get and once wasn't delivered by her. She was certainly not inviting or attentive to our table. Had it been a busy night it wouldn't have been an issue, but watching and seeing only two other tables in her section occupied I think counters that argument. We did the endless four course meal and was not asked if we wanted any more of anything, we had to ask after waiting 20 minutes often watching the fondue boil down to minimal levels. It was not a small check as it came over $120 but she seemed to make us feel guilty while asking for a second order of one of the entrees. We went there for a nice meal and are willing to pay for it but it seemed like her overall attitude gave it a Golden Coral feel. We won't be returning for awhile."}
{"text":"I would go back for sure, but with a groupon! I wish they gave you more vegetables with your entree.  They definitely do not give you enough!  The pork and lime shrimp were the stars, chicken was huge but a total waste as it had no flavor!  The dumplings were pretty good, too!

I can easily do this at home, and plan on giving it a shot.  I am curious why no Bearnaise sauce, btw?  That is a traditional sauce with steak fondue!!!

Service was slow, and when we arrived, no one there to seat us.  We waited about 5 minutes.
My beer took forever to arrive, btw.

I do think there are better places to eat, but it is a fun, social meal."}
{"text":"Pricey, small portions...very small, as in 6 tortilla chips for 5 people.  Poor service.  Very poor.  Waitress finally said we could have extra dippers for our dessert, but never came back.  Had to flag down bus people to snag the sides.  Cheeses dips are delicious, but have your wife smuggle in some extra broccoli and cauliflower florets in her purse, since these must be hard to come by in Rocky River."}
{"text":"It's such a rip-off.   I bought a Groupon to go for a \"fondue\" experience.  However, it turned out to be a nightmare.  Food is not exerciting because all you do is dipping raw vegitable into metling cheese and throwing raw meat into hot broth( not even a good broth, it smells like medicine and taste too sour, which is they highly recommand).  Also, when you try to use the Groupon, there are so many restrictions on what kind of food you could order.  I guess the Groupon is only an advertisement for the restaurant.  I paid the full price for the dinner at the end. Oh well, once in a lifetime experience that you will never want to go back!"}
{"text":"Bleh. That is how I would describe our experience. I remember it being better. Cheese was an epic fail. Salad eh. Dinner the same. Oil was not hot enough to cook at first. No veggies to speak of. Server friendly but very absent. Chocolate was non descriptive. Stomach did not feel good, neither did wallet.  Ick."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. If you go please request Karen to be your server, she was fun and fast with an awesome personality. This was my second time good and the experience topped the first time by far!"}
{"text":"Hey this place was cool!  I somehow managed to live 27 years before getting myself to one of these locations up until recently.  I thought I knew what to expect but for some reason I hadn't considered that the meat would be raw and you would cook it yourself. It was certainly a \"dining experience\"-- emphasis on experience... so make sure you're dining partners understand that your whole meal from start to finish will be LONG.  I think we were in for 2 hours.  The teriyaki steak was the best meat option I tried and the PB/chocolate dessert fondue was really tasty.  I would recommend this place for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Update 7/19/16:  Eric (Proprietor) contacted me personally and apologized that they missed my husband's special occasion.  He also put a little something in the mail to make it up to us.  Any owner or manager that takes the time to read reviews and fix problems is A+ in my book! I moved my review for The Melting Pot up to five stars for going out of the way to make their customers happy.  Can't wait to visit again! Thank you Eric for letting customers know that they matter! 
_________________
Previously 7/18/16: I came here to celebrate my husband's birthday.  It was or very first time at this resturant.  I read the reviews online and knew going into it that it was going to be somewhat pricy. I made reservations online and received a phone call at the beginning of the week verifying my reservation.  I let the girl know over the phone that we would be celebrating my husband's birthday.  She said that she would make a note in the computer.  

When we arrived the waiter asked us if we were celebrating anything special, and again I said  \"My husband's birthday. \"  I read online that for birthdays this resturant will give out a chocolate covered strawberry with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate.  By the end of dinner all we received was a bill for $120 and some change.  I didn't want to mention anything in front of my husband about the special treat because it was meant to be a surprise for him.  By the time we left my spouse knew something was wrong and that I was upset.  I had to tell him that the birthday surprise wasn't  going to happen apparently.  

The atmosphere in the resturant was nice.  The service was good.  The food quality was amazing.  The drinks were delicious. Just wish they would have gotten their act together over the special occasion.  I would have had no problem paying extra for the special treat either."}
{"text":"Nice experience. Food is great though potions are small. Service was great. Overpriced but you can get good deals with Groupon"}
{"text":"Really love cheese. This was a perfect place for me.  Love fondue. Clean as can be, outstanding service. I had a perfect salad and awesome fondue.   GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"The Melting Pot. Please allow me to summarize the experience for those of you on the fence and in a hurry to get on with your lives:

1. Dim lighting
2. Unnecessary formality
3. Uber-long dining experience
4. Lackluster desserts
5. Large bill

For those of you with the time to kill I shall now provide the detailed run-down in all its gory pulchritude.

My wife and I have been to The Melting Pot exactly twice in the last 15 years. That's right, you did read that correctly. Our first experience was so amazing I guess we just had to allow ourselves enough time to come down from the high. So what brought us back after all these years? Groupon.

As soon as you walk in you're greeted with that \"Melting Pot\" aroma. It's sort of a combination of stinky feet from the cheese and meaty wine water from all the cooking pots bubbling away on everyone's table. The water element behind the hostess station adds just the perfect amount of Dr's waiting room to the ambiance.

The atmosphere, where to begin. Should I start with the slightly too loud soundtrack of horrid brownchickenbrowncow lovemaking classics playing over the PA? I'm talking Stevie B, Barry White and Michael McDonald. Although I think the latter deserves better company. How about the lighting that's so dim most strip clubs would consider it unsafe. I've seen cave lighting that's brighter. I suppose they're going for \"romantic\" and \"intimate\". I already have a hard enough time reading most menus, I don't need the assist.

The service at The Melting Pot is definitely on the formal side. Servers bustling around dressed all in black reciting their carefully rehearsed scripts detailing exactly what they'll be doing and how they'll be doing it. I find this a bit pretentious for a chain restaurant like The Melting Pot. It just makes it feel a bit sterile. On the plus side, our server was quite friendly once she had let her guard down a bit around the entr√©e course.

Another thing you must prepare yourself for is one helluva long dining experience. We ordered all four courses - cheese, salads, entrees and dessert - and it took us a little shy of three hours from butts in booth to bloated exit. The entire experience is v e r y d r a w n o u t. Each course takes about 40 minutes and sometimes it feels like it. Just be sure to clear your schedule and bring your smartphone so you can play Candy Crush while you wait.

The food and the entire food process I guess is, I supposed, the reason you'd come to The Melting Pot. The whole \"playing with tiny pieces of meat with mini spears by cooking them in some sort of hot liquid\" method is what's made them a household name, right? Be prepared to sit there and wait through some awkward silences as your server makes everything for you as you watch. We sat there and stared at our server stirring the cheese for what seemed like an eternity.

I'm a sucker for melted cheese. Who isn't? If you come here you have to get the cheese course. After all, that's the only true \"fondue\" on the menu. The Classic Alpine is really the way to go. 

The salads, as others have already mentioned, are nothing to write home about. They're tasty enough and, at just a shade over $5 each, not terribly expensive. I just found the dressings (we tried both the House & the California) very sweet. I'd skip these and save yourself the $10.

For the entree course we selected the Coq au Vin (herbed red wine) cooking method and our Groupon allowed us to choose 6 selections from the list. Entrees are normally in the $20/person range. We chose Atlantic salmon, filet mignon, chicken potstickers, spinach and artichoke ravioli, chicken breast, and wild mushroom sacchetti (little pasta pouches with mushroom filling). Everything comes out on a little plate and your server will also dump a bowl of mushrooms, potatoes and veg into your cooking pot.

Overall, the quality of the various proteins and pastas was pretty good. On par with some of those I've had in more traditional restaurants. The various sauces they served with the meal were definitely one of the highlights and made things a bit more entertaining as we sampled our way around them. A few suggestions - gorgonzola port + beef & teriyaki glaze + salmon.

The dessert course was a big letdown. We expected a bowl of melted chocolate. We received a room-temperature bowl of Hershey's syrup. Sure, the plate of mini desserts was nice - strawberries, pineapple, bananas, marshmallows, brownies, Rice Krispie treats, pound cake - but the chocolate was awful. For the additional $9/person I'd suggest you skip it.

The Melting Pot is one of those places you definitely have to try just once. It's one of the so-called \"experience\" restaurants where the actual event is more important than the dinner. Had we not had our Groupon, our total bill would have been about $96 without tip. Ouch. For that price I think I'd rather have my food brought to me already cooked. Maybe we'll see them again in 2022."}
{"text":"Went to a Great Lakes special event beer dinner @ Melting Pot a while back and forgot to publish this post ... it was my first experience and was absolutely great!  On par with a normal meal - was $45 for cheese fondue, salad, entree, chocolate fondue PLUS 5 3oz samples of Great Lakes beers. (again, it was a special event, so not totally on par with normal cost)

Cheese fondue was garlic & herb...talk about creamy, yummy goodness.  I could have just dipped my spoon in and eaten it by the scoop, but I don't think my friends would have liked that much.

Entree was a selection of four kinds of stuff - coconut marinated shrimp, chile marinated chicken, then some kind of pork and filet mignon.  Cooks in broth, not oil.  Unfortunately, it's easy to get caught up in conversation and forget that you're cooking your meal...so I overcooked most of my food.  But it was still delish!  HOWEVER, that steaming broth ... wow, it really smelled of garlic, and unfortunately, so did I when I left!

My favorite part was the chocolate fondue.  We had dark chocolate raspberry....I don't normally LIKE dark chocolate, but this one was awesome.  Comes with a plate of fruits and other tasty treats like marshmallows, rice krispie treats, and cheesecake.

Overall, a fun and delcious experience. I am officially addicted. :)"}
{"text":"Melting Pot is a very special treat.  Both times I've been to this location, we've used a groupon.  The groupon helps, but doesn't include dessert or cheese sauce, so we still rack up quite the bill.  It is definitely a special occasion type of place.

The food is good.  I like that you can choose multiple meats or \"proteins.\"  It is a fun experience to cook the food yourself.

My only qualm is that servers seem to always be pretty busy and aren't at your table often to help.  There are certain items like veggies and dippers that are \"unlimited,\" but there's never anyone around to ask to refill you before its time for the next course.  Same goes for sauces.  They give you pretty small servings of sauces and in my experience, we usually have 1 or 2 favorites that are depleted pretty quickly, but we can rarely find someone to refill them for us."}
{"text":"If this place was priced more reasonably, I would have possibly given it 3 stars, but it is offensively expensive. I got a groupon (and STILL didn't feel like I got my money's worth), but if I had paid full price, it would have been over $100 including tax and tip for two people (appetizer, cheese course, and meat course) and one beer with no desert! At that price, it had better be amazing, right? Well, it's just mediocre and it's a snack. Neither of us were full and there have been many meals in our lives that were half price or less that were higher quality and more filling. Another reason this place gets 1 star is because of the incredibly fake atmosphere. The chef \"cooking\" the cheese in front of you while telling you the ingredients (to make it seem more gourmet) made me cringe. I thought the cheese was pretty good, but the next course, with the meat, was pretty bad. They charger you extra for flavor (they charge like $5/person to be able to cook your meat with spices)? That's a new one for me.

All in all, an incredible fake, overpriced, and mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of commercial restaurants & I have always heard that The Melting Pot was $$$--so why would I pay a ton of money for franchise food? Because there was an amazing groupon available, that's why! 

The groupon covered a salad, three types of protein (per person) and veggies which you cook yourself in a broth. We ordered drinks and a cheese fondue which cost us extra. My husband got an Asian Pear martini which was delicious. We ordered the French onion cheese fondue which came with green apples, tortilla chips, bread, and raw vegges. It was tasty enough and I was surprised that prepared it right at the table. I had expected that it would have been a prepared product squeezed out of a bag in the kitchen but we watched as she warmed beef broth, added cheese, sauteed onions, and scallions. I have to say it was... okay... but we only ordered enough cheese for one person and it was still plenty for the both of us. After that we were actually pretty full and hadn't even got out protein. We ordered chicken, orange marinated duck, filet minion, teriyaki steak, barbecue marinated pork, and spinach artichoke ravioli. The server was very friendly but, as others have said, severely rehearsed. She explained everything to us like she had said it a million times but she said it with a genuine smile which was appreciated. We didn't eat all the meat or vegetables since we were full on cheese fondue but honestly we weren't missing out on anything spectacular. The food was just okay, which is what I would have expected from any commercial joint.

However, with all of the above being said, we had a really nice date night there. The best part of the whole experience is that they sat us in a little cavern in the wall with a round booth just big enough for two. The booth was completely private from other diners and incredibly intimate with red seats and mood lighting. The entire dinner took about 2 hours. As much as I wasn't excited about cooking my own food, it was nice to relax and chat while we ate. I really wish we had room for desert because I'm sure that would have been delicious. 

Above all, I have to say that the customer service was excellent. In addition to our friendly server the manager was very helpful. We informed our server of my Husband's nut and shellfish allergies and he came to our table to see what accommodations we needed. Anyone with food allergies know how appreciated that kind of courtesy is. Also, we casually mentioned to our server that our anniversary is next week and since we didn't order desert she brought out two sparkler-clad chocolate covered strawberries on a Happy Anniversary plate. That was a nice touch. 

I would recommend The Melting Pot for special occasions and maybe getting desert or appetizers with friends. I'm not sure that I would rush right back but I will think back on our experience with a smile."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a different dining experience for a special occasion or with a select group of friends, then The Melting Pot might be just the thing for you. 

I'm not sure what brought the fondue craze from the 70's to Westgate Shopping Center in Fairview Park, and I have to admit that I had my own trepidations going in, but I can honestly say that The Melting Pot was a great dining adventure. 

Having never participated in a fondue dinner before, I was relieved when our server offered to explain how it all works, as the menu can appear quite daunting at first. Not to worry though, it's actually quite simple. 

You first select a cheese (which will be shared by your party). The cheese selection will be prepared tableside and is served with vegetables, breads, and fruits for dipping. 

Next you select your entree, which will be your protein for your meal. The Melting Pot offers a nice selection to choose from, or you can select three of your own proteins to create your own entree. Entrees are chosen individually, so everyone can choose their own. After selecting your entree, you and your party then decide on the cooking style. This is the flavor in which you will cook your proteins. Once again, your server will prepare your cooking style tableside on the cook top in the center of your table, and your proteins will be served to you raw. Simply dip your proteins into the pot, and wait about 2 minutes and your will have a delicious bite to enjoy. 

Finally you choose you're dessert. We opted for the standard milk chocolate, but The Melting Pot has a variety of flavor combinations to choose from. Your dessert fondue selection is served with fruits, pound cake, brownies, chocolate chip cookie bites, and Rice Krispy treats for dipping. 

I had originally thought about a 4-start rating, but as I'm writing this review, and recalling my experience I really can't think of a single reason to drop a star. It was a 5-star experience through and through. 

If I were to caution you on anything, it would be the price tag. Be prepared to spend $100 or more for 2 people (without alcohol). You will leave with a full belly, but close to an empty wallet to show for it as well. With that being said, for a special occasion when money isn't a primary concern, The Melting Pot offers a unique dining experience that I'm sure you and your party will enjoy."}
{"text":"For years my family has done an annual fondue night.  Melting Pot was delicious and fun but for the price, I think I'll do it at home next time."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and overall it was a pretty good experience. I went in a group of four and we ordered two four course dinners. A four course dinner is a lot of food so it can easily be split between two people if you can agree on the type of fondue and entree. Our waiter was great and was helpful in explaining the menu because if your new to the melting pot it can be kind of confusing. I had the artichoke spinach fondue or something like that which was really tasty. The entree was various kinds of meat that you get to cook in a broth of your choice. You could tell the meat was high quality and it tasted good. I ended up with the chocolate peanut butter fondue for dessert with things like fresh fruit and cake to dip into it. Each course was amazing and the service was outstanding. One of my other friends in my group and I just graduated and our waiter gave us two free chocolate covered strawberries that said congratulations. It was an awesome experience so if you have a little extra to spend on a night out I would definitely recommend the Melting Pot."}
{"text":"This is a fun fondue restaurant where they will starve you to death in the beginning and then let you stumble to your car in a food coma...
Truly a special place however. Yes, you got to cook your own meal and pay tons of money for it...but wait, when did we get so lazy to expect a meal to be cooked in a restaurant?
I had two controversial dining experiences in the same place. And I realized that like anything in life what matters about any place - is the company and the attitude. If you are stuck on a blind date (whom you don't like) in place where you got to sit for hours \"fonduing\" around and then waiter keeps bombarding you with sexual innuendos (Don't mess around you, kids, once leave ) - then yes, you are in hell and almost ready to chew on the tail of the raw lobster! 
But if you are with somebody you truly love, and time, money and salmonella (and other earthly concerns) don't matter much to you at the moment - it is a place to be! You can dip things in different cheeses, broths, you can feed each other off the fork, you can prepare a LOBSTER (see baby I can cook!)...The atmosphere in there is saturated with romance like tasty Daniel Steel's book! 
UPSIDE: nice atmosphere, friendly service, fancied up cocktails, GOOD FRESH FOOD, mind blowing dessert, and you can be a minority and order an ordinary prepared meal. 
DOWNSIDE: loooong wait (to be seated, to be fed), danger of getting burnt or poisoned ( the instructions for cooking we got were really basic), loong wait...
Conclusion: it is not a place where you go to \"grab a bite\", it is a place where bite grabs you or your time at least.  This place teaches you to savor food, but since I also belong to the crowds of sleep-deprived American workaholics gulping gallons of coffee on the run ...I can see how the place can get controversial reviews. A nation that came up with drive-thrus and pizza deliveries can handle \"Melting Pot\" only maybe once a year....before angrily asking for hamburger.
P.S. There are clothing stores ( like \" Gap\" that dress women up in men's shirts kind of proving to the general public that clothes are not everything and style can be \"raw\" what matters is who wears it. So does \"Melting Pot\". It teaches you : \" Food is good. Here it is - all raw for you. Cook it and you will know the true meaning of \"good with every bite\"."}
{"text":"Good fun and such a fun thing to do. 

Pricey - especially for the small portions 

Our waitress was Stephanie and she was great! 

The chocolate w peanut butter was fantastic!! 

Lots of sauces. 

I forgot to take pictures -- but pictures of raw food aren't appetizing anyway - lol"}
{"text":"First time visitor  (a couple of months ago ), but I would be remiss if I didn't do a review. 

First of all,  I had a Groupon that I was using.  I had a friend with me who has been to the Melting Pot before,  so she knew about portion sizes.  I thought maybe we would get less food but no, amounts were the same. With the Groupon you just get the salad and entree. But the entree includes choosing between various meats, seafood and pasta.  They put veggies and potatoes in the pot to cook while you put your food in your fondue fork and place in the pot. You also get to choose the sauces to go with your meal.

This Groupon didn't include the cheese or chocolate  fondues, but I was full nevertheless. 

Service was excellent. Our server explained their process thoroughly and was very friendly. 

Only cons - the broth was 'spitting', so every once in awhile I'd feel a bit of hot liquid on my face. I moved to the right and was fine. And it's a bit dark. Maybe increase the lighting a tad?

I love fondue (my family does one every year during  the holidays) and definitely will go back keeping pricing in mind,  since other reviews have mentioned the high prices."}
{"text":"We just spent a most enjoyable evening at the Melting Pot. If you want fast go to McDonald's if you want  good food and relaxation come here. It is a little pricey BUT there is plenty of food, a friendly  staff and time to enjoy. First they could not find our reservation but asked us to wait a little  (15 minutes ) and they would seat us. Glad we waited. Our waitress  (Annie) explained the options and spent the evening watching out for us. She was ready with refills. .brought our various courses out in a tmely manner and answered our questions with a smile. 
We try to go out monthly for a \"nice\" evening the Melting Pot is  a place we will return  to."}
{"text":"need to work on better customer service!! overall i give it two stars because the experience was horrible but the food was okay. If the waiter wants a good top treat your customers well!! it will make a HUGE difference"}
{"text":"This is at least my 4th or 5th time dining at a Melting Pot, and I just do not understand the hype. If my SIL didn't love this place, I likely would not have returned after my first visit. Family of 6 visited tonight for dinner. It was our first time at this particular location, but the experience and food was the same as other locations. Incredibly friendly service and incredibly overpriced food. 

All 6 people in our party ordered the \"4 course experience\". This includes 2 cheese fondue appetizers, 6 salads, 6 entrees (2 cooking styles), and 2 chocolate fondue desserts. 

We had the Wisconsin Cheddar and French Onion Gruy√®re cheese fondues. Were served adequate amounts of bread (pumpernickel and french), pretzel bread, tortilla chips, and apples for dipping. Oddly enough, our server only brought two small containers of vegetables to our table for dipping, \"because most people don't like them\". We asked for more, since this is one of our favorite items to dip, and were promptly brought more. In all my experiences, the cheese fondue is usually my favorite course of the meal. The French Onion fondue was better than the Cheddar in my opinion (more flavorful). 

We had 2 wedge salads, 2 chopped (house) salads, and 2 California salads. All were perfectly adequate, but not memorable. Nothing remarkable, but not terrible. The tomatoes were all \"winter tomatoes\" - not flavorful and kind of pale. The candied pecans seemed like something shaken out of a container from a grocery store. The dressing - also seemed of the grocery store variety. 

For the main course, 4 people in my party ordered the classic, per the website: \"Certified Angus Beef¬Æ sirloin, Memphis-style dry rub pork, Pacific white shrimp, Herb-crusted chicken breast, Teriyaki-marinated sirloin\". Two people subbed potstickers for shrimp. I would love to see the weight of the protein for these meals, because it has to be around a 1/4 pound. Insane to me for the price. The final two in my party (including myself) ordered the vegetarian, per the website: \"Edamame or onion rings, Artichoke hearts, Baby Portobello mushrooms, Fresh asparagus, Marinated tofu, Featured pasta, Wild mushroom sacchetti\". This also comes with unlimited potatoes, broccoli, mushrooms and dipping sauces. We had the Seasoned Court Bouillon and Coq au Vin. 

The portion sizes are almost comical for the price, but enough to be filling if you're having the 4-course experience. The vegetarian meal is a joke for $31+ in my opinion. The meal already comes with unlimited mushrooms, so adding more mushrooms to the meal doesn't make sense. Edamame and asparagus aren't really items that can be \"skewered\" and cooked fondue-style - so they end up getting tossed into the broth. You only get two ravioli and two mushroom sacchetti, both of which are so delicate that they open and lose their contents in the broth in the first 30 seconds of cooking. So frustrating. I wish there was a better non-meat option. 

The dipping sauces are all \"fine\", but they don't seem fresh. The sweet & sour sauce actually tastes a lot like the Kraft sweet & sour I used to eat on my chicken nuggets at home when I was little. The teriyaki tastes like a standard, sweet bottle variety from any store. I could go on, but just not overly impressed with the dipping sauces. None tasted like they were made fresh. 

I didn't really like the Coq au Vin, which was the cooking style closest to me. Just tasted kind of weird IMO (can't put my finger on it). The Bouillon seemed to have way too much garlic. For me to reach the 2nd cooking style was a little awkward... I felt like I was always reaching across my FIL's lap while he was trying to eat. This was also a problem with the cheese. I feel like a round table (vs. a long booth) would be better for larger parties. Also, having only two cooking styles for 6 people is a challenge as the pots become full, and it is difficult to keep the food skewered. 

Finally we had the milk chocolate and turtle fondue for desserts. Both were great with adequate items for dipping. On request, we were able to have additional bananas and strawberries free of charge. 

Overall, the service was outstanding. The food, meh. I'm never impressed. The atmosphere, also meh - it's kind of dark and sterile. For the price, I feel as if there are FAR better dining experiences in the Cleveland area. If you're a vegan, or just not feeling like meat for the night, this probably wouldn't be my restaurant of choice.  I'm sure I'll return, but not likely via my choice."}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to the Melting Pot for our Fam-aversary on New Year's Eve in 2009 and 2010.  Our son enjoys the process of working for your food and we are never disappointed with our service or the selections.  Plus if you ask, they have balloons, photos and special champagne specials on New Years."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times & both times I have used a Groupon.  I can't get over how expensive this place is if you don't have a Groupon.  I can't imagine paying full price ($60 +) and still being hungry after eating.  The portion sizes are small & steak isn't that good when it has essentially been boiled.  The seasoning comes off in the broth so no matter what kind of chicken you get - it just takes like chicken.  

On a positive note the dipping sauces are tasty.  This is a good place to come when you are not in a hurry, want to practice taking small bites and eating slow.  I wish they gave you a timer to use at the table - I felt tacky taking out my phone out and using it as a timer."}
{"text":"I went as part of a group with 2/3rds sitting at the tables to the right of a small divider and 1/3rd to the left. The group on the right received their fondues and all you can eat refills during the hour I sat there while our third just received our drinks.They clearly do not know how to handle even a group of ten people. I walked out and will not be back."}
{"text":"Go for dessert. The chocolate is good stuff. But for dinner, this is nothing exciting. The atmosphere is nice and staff was great. The food is definitely overpriced. We had the Alpine cheese fondu for starters. It was bland and elicited no excitement. Sadly, the small salad course was probably the best. Their house salad and Caesar are good. There are some vegetarian options for entrees that are decent, but again, the entrees are nothing to get excited about. The experience is what you're paying for. You get to cook things yourself and it's interesting to do so, but you're cooking your own rather pricey dishes in a mediocre base. Would I go again? Ehhh maybe if someone had their heart set on it I'd join them. I certainly wouldn't recommend it. Two people will likely spend at least 80 or more dollars for a mediocre meal. If recommend stopping for dessert: specifically the flaming turtle chocolate."}
{"text":"This place used to be good till they made changes in the past year. They got rid of the Wisconsin Trio (which was their best cheese), cut portions, and ditched the cheesecake. They also stopped offering their \"big night out\" which was the most convenient way to pick a meal with your date. And although I know it's probably not the first place that comes to mind to take a small child they don't have changing tables in the bathroom which was a huge inconvenience with my little one."}
{"text":"We love celebrating with the kids here. They love cooking their own food and roasting marshmallows at the table. But our favorite part is the magician!"}
{"text":"Went there with my girlfriend and her two kids. The atmosphere is very nice and very first class the waiter knew exactly what she was doing. 

The food was average and plentiful. The whole experience took over 2 1/2 hours

We did the four course meal with salads entr√©e appetizer and dessert. 

Great place to go on a date night. But make sure you bring your wallet or credit card because it is very pricey. Dinner for four people cost $178 without tip. 

For that price I think I rathet go to a five star steakhouse."}
{"text":"Don't go to this location. I've been to several Melting Pots in different states that were awesome. (Maybe not now because of menu change) Last night I had reservations at 545 and we did not get a drink on the table until 630! The meal was served painfully slow, so slow that we were hungry when we left. We didn't leave the restaurant until after 9pm. 

The food... the changes to the menu are negative. They took off the popular Big Night Out and got rid of most of the tasty cheese fondu. They also give you less bread dippers and substituted them for  nachos...nachos! The entrees are much smaller than in the past and the chocolate was served cold and the waitress didn't bother to stir the ingredients. Our bill was 275.00 for 4 people and we were all very irritated. I used to love the Melting Pot but now it's just a rip off. GO FOR HAPPY HOUR HALF OFF CHOCOLATE AND CHEESE. I wouldn't bother with anything else."}
{"text":"I've been to the melting pot before and headed there last night after buying a groupon. 

I started with the wedge salad which was really tasty. The presentation was interesting with the bacon and tomatoes laying on the side. It needed a tad more dressing and the wine seasoning was terrific to add on giving it more flavor.

From there I chose the teriyaki marinated sirloin and shrimp for my meal. Both were really good with the teriyaki sauce. I also loved the vegetables (mushroom, red potatoes, and broccoli) cooked in the mojo broth and with the green goddess sauce. We asked for extra veggies which are complimentary. 

I was hoping for dessert but was stuffed."}
{"text":"We went to the Melting Pot on a Saturday night, with a reservation ahead of time. The atmosphere was perfect, and we were in a booth that we could actually have a nice conversation in. We were blown away how accomidating they were for Gluten Free. They had baguette for dipping into the cheese and even used GF beer in the cheddar one. The Alpine Swiss fonue was amazing! The meat course was better than ususal, and seems their portions are much bigger now that you get to pick your own protien instead of sharing for the table. I loved the shrimp and filet. For dessert they had gluten free brownies, pound cake, and made sure to load up the strawberries, pineapple, and marshmellows. Wow, that is the best GF food outside of a purely GF restaurant we've ever had. Bravo melting pot! Finally, I highly recommend going for birthdays they have the best chocolate covered strawberries with a sparkler for a treat at the end!"}
{"text":"Melting Pot has quickly over the last year won my heart. My first visit here was last March as a surprise for my fiancee's birthday, and I have returned here almost every few months since.

I honestly don't get why so many people think Melting Pot is overpriced. On my most recent visit, the bill came to $125 bucks for a 4-course meal for two and 4 cocktails. The dining experience always takes at least an hour to an hour an a half for us, and that is with a constant fill of food, drinks, and fun. You're poking things with forks and putting them into a steaming pot...get a few of their strong and delicious cocktails in you, and it becomes pretty darn entertaining.

The food never disappoints. I'm sure the meat isn't the most high-end organic grass-fed fancy stuff some people expect, and the cheese isn't some kind of organic non-hormone laced experiment, but the food is tasty. I usually stick to the classics: cheddar fondue, the house salad (which don't forget to smother that baby with wine&garlic seasoning), and the classic meat entree. The cookies and cream fondue is by far the best dessert. Besides the food, the cocktails are some of the best I've had. The smores martini is the best offering, but the pear cocktail is also to die for. One of the best things about Melting Pot is if you run out of dippers for your cheese or chocolate, they'll happily bring more until you're satisfied.

Besides the food and drink being awesome, the service is equally superb. The waiters are always friendly and talkative. They go beyond making small talk as they're preparing your food. The waiters know how to make jokes and be generally entertaining. This last time I visited, my waiter went out of his way to get the bartender to make me my favorite cocktail (which was not being offered on the menu at the time.) That's going above and beyond to make sure I was happy. The staff always makes sure to ask what occasion you're celebrating, and if it's a birthday or an anniversary, they will make sure the kitchen will write a message in chocolate on your dessert plate.

5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Melting Pot at this location on 3 different occasions and it's been a near identical experience:

1. Great service (I don't understand the people who've had bad service or long waits)
2. Great food (don't skip dessert)
3. Dim lighting (you can barely read the menu)

To expand on the service, I have to say that every waiter/waitress we've had is super friendly and very prompt. Waters and food all came out quickly.

The food is always wonderful as well. It is definitely a novelty, as other people have commented, and it's going to be about a 2 hour dinner if you do salads, entrees and desserts. But you're cooking your own food, so it's going to take longer than if you go to a more conventional restaurant.

They give you plenty of food, although when it comes out you're like, 'what am I, a bird?!?' It doesn't look like much, but you will roll out of that place you'll be so full. Plus, if you ask, they'll bring extra veggies if you run out. Same goes for the dipables if you get dessert.

The lighting... this is where I had to ding them. It's ridiculously dark. I mean, if you are afraid of your date seeing what you look like, just meet them in a booth. Any booth will do. I get the whole ambiance thing, but my mom and I could barely read the menus. It makes you wonder what they're hiding.

Overall, great experience and some place to go every so often (or just for dessert!)."}
{"text":"Great food. Terrible service. 

The food here was fantastic which was a real surprise to my wife and I. We were expecting a much lower quality of food. I would have given this place a better review but the service was absolutely terrible. We had to wait over 50 minutes for the server to bring us or first cheese fondue thing. I would also stay away from the mixed cocktails. There were just way too sweet and everyone we ordered a drink our waitress would disappear for 2o minutes.  One time she did not even come back with our second round."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a Groupon with 2 adults, 2 children and a teenager.

Our server, David, was amazing, but you could tell he was being rushed because they were short staffed.

The ladies restroom was horrible - zero toilet paper, 1/2 the lights were out and scared a child when she went in there. 

Our melted cheeses were great, not too impressed with the vegetarian plate, very unimpressed with the lobster salad - I don't think I could justify the upcharge for that salad - the lobster was minuscule and fake - nothing like I expected. 

The chicken and shrimp was amazing and so were the veggies and dips.  We really liked the pot stickers as well. 

We waited for more items to dip into our chocolate fondue and had to leave 1/2 the chocolate behind due to the server being so busy we never received anything extra to eat. 

As we left we tried to share our experience with the hostess and she dismissed us and did not empathize with our problem. 

I realize our Groupon took some $ off our bill, but we still ordered $80 above and beyond what the Groupon was. 

Overall it was good food and the kids enjoyed it, but I think the staff needed to work better together and support the customers."}
