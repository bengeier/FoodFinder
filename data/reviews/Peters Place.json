{"text":"The smell when one enters would by itself be enough reason to leave. I was there for a funeral reception so I had no choice but to stay. 
The food was actually adequate. Except for the fact that the green beans on the funeral buffet word almost like paste from being over cooked, the chicken and mashed potatoes were delicious.
The biggest problem is that the building is just filthy. The Decore ugly. And the bathrooms, should be reported to the health department. The bathrooms at the entrance of the building create a horrible smell and are filthy.
I would never come back to this place"}
{"text":"Good food, but kind of pricey.  Mostly a senior citizen crowd and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great staff! Kathy was so helpful with the menu and she went out of her way to make us comfortable. Such a family oriented atmosphere with good Italian food!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, disgusting bathroom. We had reservations for Thanksgiving, but we still had to wait 30 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. I went to the bar to get a drink while waiting. The bartender was nowhere to be found. A waitress had to pick up the slack and take drink orders. They run all of their bar tabs by hand (1990 called and said get a computer!). 

Our waitress came by once during the entire meal. 

The worst part was the bathroom. The toilet paper dispenser was falling off the wall, one stall had no lock, the toilet seat was stained, and the hand dryer was covered in mold. Filthy! Imagine what the kitchen is like. 

I would never, ever recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I went here for a baby shower and the place is gross.  Very dirty.  You can tell no one cares about it.  The decor is old fashioned and the food is sub par.  Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I ate here last night. I dont know about their other entrees but WOW the Chicken Tiffany was to die for! Twice baked potato was yummy too. The food was so good I had to give a good rating. That being said, the service is bad. Nice waitress, for sure! But it really does take forever to get your bill. The beers weren't cold at all either, which sucks. But if you can put that aside, try that Chicken Tiffany."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Well, upon walking into the restaurant we were greeted with a \"Mother's Day\" Christmas tree containing loofas, dolls, sea shells, and other confusing propaganda.  Oh, and the hostess wasn't in uniform, instead, she was wearing jeans and a hoodie which made it extremely difficult to pick her out from a normal patron.  When we were seated, we apparently needed a 12 seater table and only 4 menus for 8 people.  Clearly math is an issue.  When we were able to track down another waitress for more menus, she seemed reluctant to give us more.  I ordered a cup of seafood bisque and the Maryland crab cake (yes, one)  and my cousin ordered the seafood bisque and a cranberry pecan chicken salad.  Their \"famous\" seafood bisque was frothy and lacking flavor, but overall we weren't too disappointed.....yet.  Unfortunately, after waiting a decent amount of time for our meals without salad and soup plates being cleared, we received our entrees.  My \"Marlyand\" crab cake was canned crab and was supposed to come with a side of Newberry sauce.  Apparently, Newberry sauce = more seafood bisque in a different bowl.  No lie.  Same soup trying to be passed off as \"sauce\" for crab cakes!  Needless to say, it was unappetizing.  My cousin's meal however came fresh from 3 different bags.  Bag #1 was the lettuce, bag #2 were the cranberries (aka: craisins), and bag #3 consisted of chopped pecans.  The chicken looked like it came from 3 different meals and wasn't even chopped up well.  Neither of us could eat our food.  The only reason this review received 1 star was because we were so entranced with the architecture and how we might survive an attempted escape from a fire.  Seriously, who designed this place?  Steps randomly placed in the middle of the dinning room, random angles, dirty ceilings, mirrored walls, employees wearing street clothes texting in the middle of the dinning room, and egregiously priced \"food.\"  Needless to say, Peter's Place will not be graced with our presence again."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE... we had a bridal shower and the place was nothing what it seems. The private bathroom we had to our banquet room was FILTHY absolutely DISGUSTING that the guests wouldn't even use it.  The food was horrendous, the servers couldn't have been over the age of 16 and all had extremely poor attitudes. Not to mention the manager was unbelievably unprofessional.  Took 2 hours for a few guests to get their salads that we already told them how many of each salad we would be having, and their justification was that they had to make it.. since when does a salad made of iceburg lettuce and thrown on craisins take two hours? There was a termite outbreak during the middle of opening presents and the manager blamed it on a poorly put in window.. which is a CROCK. He came out spraying a bunch of aerosols during this time which was so embarrassing, a few elderly guests had to leave because he was fumigating the room.  After we told him to stop he ceased. He smelt of alcohol, and while speaking to the owner about it, it didn't seem to phase him, he didn't have anything to say about it and really didn't seem to care much, it was like speaking to a brick wall. I WILL NEVER go back and I will WARN EVERYONE to NOT waste their time and money here. You'd have better food and better service at Eat'N'Park."}
{"text":"We have dined at what is considered some of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh has many great restaurants but, we have found the best lobster tail and crab cakes at Peter's place in Bridgeville. Great service and amazing desserts! Max & Carolyne"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very nice dinner there. Service was awesome and the food was very good. I think it is alittle pricy but had a coupon"}
{"text":"My partner and I were on our way to a meeting in Pittsburgh and since we were a bit early we thought we'd stop for a quick sit down lunch. Randomly picked Peter's Place and we actually weren't disappointed. Sure, the place is super dated and we were hands down the youngest folks in there (by decades) but the lunch special was worth it. I had the seafood bisque (probably the the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot) and crab almondine...he had a French dip sandwich w/ fries. Good portions and super friendly service! Will definitely go back our next time in the city."}
{"text":"Took my wife to Peters Place for dinner and was shocked at the condition of the dinning area.  There were dirty dishs at the bus boy stand, some tables were not cleaned.  I ordered a filet mignon cooked medium and a twice baked potato.   My wife wife had fried shrimp.  The steak was raw in the center,  the potato was lukewarm,  the shrimp were very small  and over cooked.  It was brought to the attention of ou waitress (who was the only bright spot in the joint).  She apologized anw showed it to the manager/owner who was sitting two tables away.  They offered to re-cook the steak (which I declined.   We were then given a piece of cake for our troubles.  I should have told the manager what he could do with the cake.  I will never return to this dump.  It is a shame how run down it has become. It used to be one of the great resturnts in the area.  The health insectors should visit this place."}
{"text":"Although dated the restaurant was clean, the waitress was very nice, although she also had to act as bartender (a little understaffed), but this could of been for a number of reasons. The food was good, nothing out of the ordinary, the carrot cake was good. I had a coupon from restaurant.com which made it half price. A little pricey for the type of restaurant but would probably go again if in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant did not honor an online coupon because it was not printed out, so it could \"not be redeemed\".  I asked what they do to \"redeem\" a coupon and they had no answer. 

The food is also nothing to write home about, the place kinda smells, and bathrooms are dirty."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. I want to throw up every time I eat here. For some reason, my family picks here for big events. We came here after a funeral and the food was almost as upsetting as the funeral. The food was dry and just tasted... gross. The server had some sort of infected open wound on his hand and reached over us without warning. The women's room bathrooms were disgusting and the locks on the doors didn't work. Such a nightmare."}
{"text":"First I want to say that we had the sweetest waitress ever who was very attentive and accommodating the second star is entirely for her. The atmosphere is a little grungy, but it is what it is. But the food... That was inedible, and I eat pretty much anything. Two of us ordered the fettuccini Alfredo. It was a mess. It had a terribly strong aftertaste, like something (maybe the grated cheese?) Was rotten. I ordered the veal Romano which tasted like scrambled eggs and old cheese over very low quality mystery meat. The rolls were hot, bisques were good, salads were fine,  but those entrees... It would have been better if they took a jar of store bought sauce that costs $4 a jar and dumped it on some three day old pasta."}
{"text":"I just spoke with my mother about Peter Place to be inform that her and her elderly friends were denied to go as a group for a luncheon. My mother along with her friend are part of a program called the Vintage where elderly people attend during the day to socialize, engage into art's and crafts and at times take various different field trips at the requested of the group. 
 
Peter Place was introduce to my mother by her bus driver who happen to praise Peter Place! Personally I looked for myself on Yelp and see that the ratings are low and the photos of the food looks digesting! 

Peter Place it is 2015 and if you are having a issue with elderly African Americans eating at your location perhaps you should relocate deep down in the depth of the South. 

Also my fiancée just called around 5 minutes ago and was able to book a luncheon for 50 people! So I guess my people (Black People) have to sound like a white girl from Wexford PA to get some respect and prepared servers. I only give Peter Place 1 star because I had to rate something."}
{"text":"In 5 yrs of being a patron I have never been disappointed in the food or service. Done the place many times as a couple, a small group (4-6)  a few times had a party there for 11(main dining room) and attended an event there (meeting room, buffet meal.) What I love about P's Place: great food & service and good prices, generous portions. Seriously the seafood bisque is so good, fish on menu (VA spots, salmon, lobster, crab cakes) fresh & well prepared. Their chicken & veal dishes also very nicely done. Fresh & tasty warm rolls and very good desserts.
Like the decor. Not trendy or upbeat but real linens on the table, very pleasant , simply classic. No huge plasma TV's. It's a restaurant, not a sports bar, so the staff dresses in B & W,
not \"Black & Gold\" whatever the season. Actually nice to get great food, service...and NOT have loud music, a trendy menu and be able to enjoy a meal without some servers tap dancing & singing, interrupting. Yes, please go if you would like to have a great meal in a pleasant place for very good value. Turn off your phone and talk to your date or dining companions, you can do it there."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place needs a lot of work!!! From the rest rooms to the food.  Rest rooms are dilapidated and seem to be rotting under the sink.  It also needs air fresheners.  
I got the Boston Scrod,  very dry. Unfortunately we were with family for a funeral and had no choice."}
{"text":"So I would give this establishment no stars. It needs to be closed by the department of health. I am not a picky person but having flies circulating our table waiting for dinner was not appetizing. The smell was horrid and it needs a visit from Gordan Ramsey. Lucky enough there was an issue with our Groupon which saved us from consuming a meal that might have made us sick for days. Pittsburgh is beautiful and this place is a dump. Food was overpriced and there were signs of terrible leaks in the restaurant area and the bathroom. Do not purchase this asa Groupon. My husband and I made jokes the whole time we were there. Happy birthday to me."}
{"text":"I always thought this place was upscale decided to check it out for the first time last week.  Completely disappointed.  Seafood platter shrimp rubbery, salmon over cooked.  I only liked the scallops.  Bathroom disgusting.  This place is in need of a renovation stuck in the 80s.  Complained to waitress but she did nothing but say sorry.  Not good way to get a repeat customer.  If you are looking for a nice place to go to dinner don't have this place on your list.  It seems like I was eating in a retirement home."}
{"text":"The service was TERRIBLE. It was an hour and a half after our reservation time and arrival before the first entree appeared, and that was after I walked out to the front desk to complain that we had no service.  The last entree did not arrive until 2 hours after our arrival. Dinner took over 3 hours!  And the food was OK at best. I will never go back."}
{"text":"I went here with my husband for the first time last night because I had a Groupon. We were both turned off by the dark parking lot and wooden walkway from there to the front door. (The walkway was definitely a fall hazard, especially since the lot was so dark.) We did not have to wait for a table and like others said, the decor was outdated. My seat also had a large tear on it that was covered in bright blue duct tape. It took some time for the waitress to take our order, but everything was pretty speedy once she did. My husband was not very happy with his crab cakes or the shell he found in his seafood bisque. I got the spaghetti and meatballs, which we both agreed were pretty good. I also got the seafood bisque, which I thought was really good. However, I too got a small piece of shell in mine. I doubt we'll go back unless another Groupon appears."}
{"text":"Had the Easter buffet today. We had a little bit of a wait but to be expected on a holiday. The food on the buffet was good. The service was good. No real complaints."}
{"text":"I had a coupon from restaurant.com. we tried this restaurant. My husband had a filet mignon. They tried three times to cook this steak correct. The first two times. It was raw. The last time it was burnt. We never got refills on drinks or had the server ask about the meal. They gave us one free desert. But even that was burnt. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We came for our family dinner.  The food took a long while to arrive but was very good.  The folks had the Virginia spots and raved.  The biggest annoyance was the thirty or so flies that tormented us throughout the evening.  The family gave the food a five but service and atmosphere a 1."}
{"text":"We had a groupon for dinner (4 pepple) so we decided to check it out. This was my first time but my parents had been there before. The food and service was very good. Mary was nice and made sure we had everything we needed. The parking lot is a bit dark. They have a Christmas tree up year round but the theme is current. Tonight we saw the Fall foliage tree and it was very nice. The decor is old school but nostalgic not old and raggedy. Its a very spacious place with a great location. The rolls were delicious. I had the Fettuccine Neptune  (Shrimp, scallops and crab meat) I really enjoyed my dish. Large portions, fair price and seasoned well. They had a special Octoberfest menu so we tried the gouda dip appetizer and it was outstanding. The chips were good as well. I will definitely go back. I was interested in the salmon as well as the sea scallop dishes I saw on the menu so after a great experience I will return."}
{"text":"This place is in serious need of an update. The food is ok (nothing to write home about) but the place is a relic of the early 90s."}
{"text":"Our family has been going here for years.  Always consistent, Service is always great and friendly, Food is beyond excellent.  I recommend the Chicken Tiffany, Lobster bisque and save room for dessert."}
{"text":"The food is excellent. But the service sucks! Our waitress had no finesse or kindness. We had to ask for extra rolls. She didn't come around and ask us how our foood was."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service 
Would highly recommend this place to people
There chicken Tiffany is to die for and there turkey club sandwich is terrific"}
{"text":"Peter's place has some great Italian dishes and a quiet relaxed atmosphere which is a nice break from the busier chains. The pricing was on the higher side for some menu items but the food was worth it."}
{"text":"I gave this place one star because I had to pick something. You know why the lights are dark because it is hiding all the dirt, this place needs a health inspection now! I'm calling on them my sister got a coke and this was on the inside of her cup we emptied the top to show the waiter and she said oh maybe I should have checked it!?!?! DO NOT COME HERE!"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. Kathy took great care of us! She let us know her favorites, made sure we enjoyed our meals and that we were happy. We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Found Peter's Place on Groupon with stellar reviews. Yelp gave us pause, so we went with no expectations.  While they were a bit understaffed, all of the team was friendly and attentive from the moment we walked in.  Not sure why there were reviews about cleanliness - it is dated, but very clean, well-kept and relaxing atmosphere.  

The food was simply amazing.  Great prices, large portions, and our compliments to the chefs (one was new and in training).  I loved my Veal Oscar - so much yummy crab and the veal was cooked to perfection.  My partner was over the moon for his Fettuccini Neptune - it was LOADED with seafood, the alfredo was wonderful, and I don't think I've ever seen a plate of pasta that large.  

But my favorite thing, which I could have taken home buckets of - and might have if I lived nearby - was the seafood bisque.  Great on their stuffed mushrooms (the mushrooms were very well loaded with crab as well!) and like no other bisque I've had - over the top delicious. I recommend dunking the rolls.  

Also love that they are local and have been there for 30+ years. Thank you for exceeding our expectations, Mike Peters and staff."}
{"text":"As a child, I remember thinking Peter's Place was a classy restaurant that I always wanted to go to but just never did.  I went once for a college admissions interview years ago but only had dessert.  Luckily, I found a Groupon for it and figured I'd try the place as an adult.  We went on a Sunday evening.  The place looked like an old reception hall.  We ordered the Virginia Spots dish and Chicken Romano.  Our server was great but the food was bland.  The side salad was kind of too cold, I assume from it being stored in a refrigerator rather than being prepared fresh.  The meat/l and fish had no seasoning aside from the breading so it was bland. The green bean casserole was great, the bread was nice and warm but the butter pats were cold. Had strawberry shortcake for dessert which was pretty good.  All and all, I'm glad I went WITH the groupon.  Without it, I don't think I would have been pleased spending full price for the food experience there.  I think the restaurant could use Chef Ramsey's assistance because it definitely has potential but right now it's kind of lacking."}
{"text":"Food was okay and took a long time for service."}
{"text":"The food is made from scratch and made well. The place is clean.  The waitresses are vigilant.  The seafood bisque is beautifully blended and tastes like it was made with real cream.  The salad dressings taste home made and  not bottled by Kraft.  The food is \"honest\" -- if they say its \"prime\" beef, then it's not \"choice\" beef disguised with a lot of salt.  If they say it's calf's liver, it's not \"baby beef.\"  The seafood is well executed and not over-salted.  The veal parmesan tasted like grandma made it (if grandma was a really good cook).  The menu is pricier than Kings and other chains, but you aren't getting pancakes & bacon, you're getting dishes that involve preparation and a caring chef.  I don't choose my eating establishments by how old the clientele is like some of the reviewers.  But last night, there was an older couple celebrating an anniversary, a young couple on what sounded like a first or second date, a family with a baby (a QUIET baby) celebrating a birthday and several tables of miscellaneously aged \"adults.\"   Treasure this place while it's here and eat here while you can."}
{"text":"You know the old saying \"Not your Grandfather's this, not your grandfather's that? Well this is your grandfather's restaurant. Basic fifties place with wood paneling, sconces, large light fixtures, ugly carpeting, and a menu without nuance. Steaks, chops, chilled salads (mixture of iceberg, an olive or two, maybe a half a hard boiled egg, purple onion, and a way too heavy salad dressing) and other fifties style entrees. Typical South Hills restaurant, sad and old."}
{"text":"CLOSED, thank God!!! 
This place went out of style about 15 years ago. I have no idea how anyone could have eaten here. Health Department just cited them for rats, mice and droppings. A real cesspool. Glad it's finally gone."}
{"text":"The crap cakes were ok. Others had steaks which looked really good. I would consider visiting again."}
{"text":"My family and I ate here as a group on a Saturday night, and it was...interesting.  The service was not very attentive, and albeit we were a large party, at times it was borderline rude by one of the servers.  We were drinking wine and cocktails  throughout the course of dinner, but nothing out of the ordinary.  One of the servers just acted as if we were a complete inconvenience, something we generally do not encounter on evenings out.

As far as the menu goes, it is VERY diverse.  If you have a craving for something, I'm sure they have it on the menu.  The salads are pretty average, so I would recommend trying the seafood bisque instead.  It was hot and creamy, something to really warm your soul on a cold night.  

The entrees.  There are a TON to choose from, it is a bit overwhelming.  Many people in our party ordered from the Oktoberfest menu, but they were out of several of the items already, despite our reservation being early before 7:00 pm.  Everything we had was pretty run of the mill, nothing too outstanding.  The food was delivered hot and seemingly fresh to the table, but just didn't have anything about the seasoning or presentation that made it stand out from any other restaurant in the area.

For the price, the portions are reasonable, and the drink/wine menu is also very conservative, but I think this restaurant could really excel if it limited the menu to its most popular/specialty items, refining those to a perfect plate.  The service could also be kicked up a notch, maybe just reminding everyone that a smile is always appreciated!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great crab and spots at Peters Place.  IF you like fish Peters Place has he best Virginia Spots."}
{"text":"This place has serious potential but would benefit from updating the place. It has a mildew feel and is outdated. It presents as a place that is upscale but it really is not.

I had the Stuffed Chicken Breast with Mashed Potatoes. And Seafood Bisque. It was not bad, but wasn't anything special as well. My mom got the Salmon and said it was cooked too long. And there is nothing worse than a dry grilled salmon.
The Filet Mignon was a hit and those who ordered it enjoyed it, So if you are looking for a good filet mignon, this could be a possible place. 

However, the waitress Darlene was very nice and hospitable. She was very patient and even took the salmon off and ordered my mom a filet mignon.

Will I come back here though, probably not. The food isn't really worth it, and the atmosphere is too grimy for me."}
{"text":"Place is good.  I really like there orange salmon and artichoke appetizer.  There is a much older crowd here and it is kind of dim.  If you need a party space they do have lots of rooms and it's reasonable."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed. The place wants to be a fine dining place and may have been in 1980, but it does not appear to have been updated since. If you want an older feel, then it may be appealing. My meal was decent, but my fiancé had the chicken Devonshire which was basically a cheese soup with a piece of toast and chicken tenders- can not recommend that dish if you do decide to dine there. I think it has a great location and potential if it received some updating to the physical space and also the menu."}
{"text":"Food is okay...crab cakes were good, salmon was average. No draft beer. Surroundings need updating, but restaurant was clean. Service is slow and it takes forever to finalize your check if you pay by credit card. For the price, there are better options."}
{"text":"if i could put a big red stop sign here, i would! BEWARE!!! don't go here, unless you're over 75 & you've got all day to wait!!! my girlfriends & i went here yesterday for our monthly \"ladies lunch\". it was NOT good. the food was so bland, lacking flavor, soft & mushy. you could call it retirement home food. my seafood appetizer tasted like butter-soggy bread crumbs. the waitress was THE slowest waitress i have ever encountered. it took 20 mins. to get iced teas & coffees. it took almost 3-3 1/2 hours for lunch!!!! no one asked for dessert for fear of getting stuck there for another hour.  the only reason they get a star, is due to the guy bussing tables. 1st, he was SO cute!!! we \"cougars\" wanted to have HIM served up on a platter in the middle of the table!!!! plus, he did more for us than the waitress! so thank you mr. busguy(he was no boy!)!!! you saved us from an otherwise dull lunch!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night for our late Valentine dinner. We used a coupon from the enjoy book which was nice. When you first walk in, I can say the aroma of fish and another unpleasant smell was a bit unappealing. It wasn't very busy, but took staff way too long to notice us and take our order. I have not had service that took that long in a while. We were there for about 2 hours it took that long. It was also extremely dark in the restaurant for some reason. I can say staff was very friendly and pleasant. I ordered the chicken parm with seafood bisque soup and my boyfriend ordered the veal Parmesan with a salad. We really enjoyed the taste of the food and portion size, minus my soup being a bit cold. I think the restaurant definitely needs a few updates but the food tasted good."}
