{"text":"We wanted to go to the Vietnamese place down the street, but it was closed. I am SO glad it was! We got tea, egg noodles and pork vermicelli. The egg noodle soup was absolutely phenomenal. Tasted so authentic, full of flavor, like walking in the door after a long trip home. The vermicelli was also very good and the salad on top was fresh and vibrant. Sonny the owner was very kind and outgoing. I would definitely go back. Again and again!"}
{"text":"I had the Bun Bo Hue (pronounced \"boon-bo-hway). If you've never heard of it, it's a spicy (obviously from the picture) beef based soup that a lot of places serve on the weekend. The broth's balance of salty, sour, sweet and savoury balances on a fine line where a little bit in either direction will throw the soup off completely. There is a profound depth of flavour in this noodles dish, fragrant in lemongrass and spices, the toppings are similar to the dac biet, with the addition of black pepper \"cha lua\" - Vietnamese steamed pork loaf, the same that's found in banh mi, however, the rice noodles in this dish are thicker and cylindrical."}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue (spicy noodle soup with beef) was simply fantastic!  Our daughter had a rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and imperial roll, which was also amazing.  Everything here is fresh, authentic and made from scratch with the best of ingredients.  They certainly don't cut corners and the owner is very passionate about his food.  
This is not a bastardized version of vietnamese cuisine made to appeal to the masses...which is a good thing.  We will go back often, this is a wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested to me by some of my family members and I was not disappointed! I had a  pho with very generous portions of beef and tendons.
 my girlfriend tried the chicken vermicelli bowl and it was great! generous portion of tender and fresh chicken.

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"We had Pho tai nam( pho with raw beef and flank steak) and Bun ga nuong chagio(Vermicellis with grilled chicken, salad and Imperial roll). 
Both were very good, Chicken was tender and tasty, delicious. Salad was very fresh. The beef was also very good quality. 
Staff was very friendly. We totally recommend this restaurant!
This restaurant is closed on Every Wendsday. It is directly across the exit of the Metro station."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple, much like the menu. Awesome food, an incredibly friendly staff, it's easy to find, and it doesn't empty your wallet. That pretty much sums up the qualities and pros of Sen Vang. 

The menu covers the basics of Vietnamese cuisine and does an amazing job of everything. I had the rare beef pho, and the flavor of the broth was simply sublime in it's mix of sweet and salty. The quality of the ingredients is definitely higher than some other Vietnamese restaurants in town and I could tell instantly that great care was taken in the preparation of the food as the beef was not stuck together is it can tend to be, and there were generous portions of noodles and beef in the bowl. 

One of the hidden gems by far. Definite 5 stars"}
{"text":"Love this place. One of the best pho place on cote des neiges. You guys should come here comfort food is what they serve and full of flavor"}
{"text":"Worth of money. Roast chicken rice is $8.25, which is yummy! Will try the pho next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho !! Wish they had some shrimp springroll with the rice paper ! But everything said amazing pho i was really suprised by the food quality (meat was good ) i recommend !"}
{"text":"It's worthy to be here for Bun Bo Hue and also Bun Rieu which usually don't have on the menu. Needless to say they are special for Pho. It's so authentic! Don't forget to order Cha Gio , the taste is so unique that you can't get anywhere else but Sen Vang.
The staffs are all excellent, especially the cook, she is working hard to make all the dishes come out with the best taste. 
The last reason for this 5 stars rating is the cleanness and fresh cozy atmosphere when you enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The service is super friendly and welcoming and they master vietnamese specialties like bun bo hue. A must try!!"}
{"text":"My Vietnamese friend recommends this place strongly! I have tried Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef noodle) and Pho Dac Biet, I like the broths very much. It seems a family restaurant, not the kind to sell to tourist. The place is very clean with friendly service and the price is sweet ! (cash only , btw! )"}
{"text":"I went to this place for the bun bo hue. This place was close to authentic outside of going to Vietnam . They serve small and large size. Both are under $10. If you love bun bo like me I'd recommend ordering the large."}
{"text":"Quick service. The use of msg is a quite blatant, especially in the chicken pho broth. Servings are pretty generous in noodle, not so much in meat. But I did enjoy the beef itself, both the thinly sliced juicy brisket and the rare sirloin were on point."}
{"text":"Great rare beef  pho... broth was perfect,  served nice and hot, good amount of beef.  Very reasonable prices too. .. 7.75$ for a small, and I think around 8.75$ for a large.  had the imperial rolls too and they were delicious!   Friendly service.  Will definitely be back.
only small issue was finding parking. but that has nothing to do with the quality of  food at this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I wanted to go for pho with my sister on a Monday and guess what, a bunch of Vietnamese restaurants are closed on Mondays. So we had very limited choices and wanted it to be on Côte-des-neiges, so finally, we settled onRestaurant Sen Vàng. I was very pleasantly surprised by their pho, as it also had that sweet taste in the broth that I love. However, portions once again were a bit on the small side (I ordered the large, which was the biggest format). I also learned something new that day, which is that there is an herb called culantro (no, not cilantro) and it is supposedly better than the Thai basil leaves that are typically served with pho. Maybe it's a question of what you're used to, but I definitely prefer Thai basil. In any case, it was a bit of a educative meal

{"text":"On a hunt for some good Pho, I found awesome reviews of Sen Vang, and brought a group of 6 people here. Some of us had Pho, and some had chicken or beef/vermicelli plates - everything was spot on. I thought that although the Pho was good, the other plates tasted better, but that might just be because I get antsy since Pho takes forever and a day for you to finish it (yes, I get bored).

Prices are super reasonable, service is great, and the food is good. Perfect for a quick low key meal!"}
{"text":"Slowly the complex flavors of a generous sized bowl of Pho Dac Biet unfurl like the petals of the lotus flower in this new family-owned establishment! The beef seasoned broth served along rice noodles, thinly sliced beef, meatballs, tendon, is authentic and close to what you would expect from a homemade concoction - easy on the cloves and lean on the fat content.

You will also find your staple choices of egg noodle with bbq pork and shrimp soup, various rice or rice vermicelli dishes with grilled chicken, pork, beef and the famous vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. 

Recently inspired from my foodie friend's posting, I was intrigued and had to stop and try it out. Although only officially inaugurated two weeks ago, owners Son & Thao are working out the usual minor opening related kinks but this seems to be a promising outlet for soups & noodle cravings!

Definitely must return to try \"off-menu\" items such as Bun Bo Hue (spicy beef and thick noodle soup) or Bun Rieu  (crab and noodle soup). What surprises do the friendly Sen Vang (Golen Lotus) owners Son and Thao await us on our next visit?Come and find out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Sen Vang is a great little homely cozy friendly Vietnamese restaurant in my hood and I've started eating here on the regular.

Their soup is tasty, the broth is just salty enough, without being over the top. The portions are just right.

Their beef is fresh and yummy and so is their grilled chicken.

Their vermicelli dishes are a tad too big for my tummy (not that that's stopped me from gleefully wolfing them down anyway) and their prices do reflect the larger portion size. They're so big you could pretty much split one between two people and have a smaller dish on the side.

I tried one of their rice dishes, their simplicity and savouriffic salaciousness was succulent and satisfying. Seriously, the grilled chicken on rice did not disappoint.

Their prices for pho soups are very reasonable, so that definitely keeps me coming back, it's a real no brainer to eat here frequently.

I gotta say for a local eatery in the cote sainte Catherine neighbourhood, I'm surprised how good it is. I even prefer it to the slightly upmarket Hai Hoang up the road. The quality, value, and friendly service, everything is just how I like it.

Five stars - will eat again. A"}
{"text":"Was strolling along Victoria with the boo and decided to grab a bite at this spot. GREAT IDEA :)

We had the grilled chicken plate (chicken, rice, salad, fish sauce) and the special Bun Bo Hue (a spicy beef noodle soup). Both were quite tasty. I probably would ask them to hold the blood cube next time (just a personal preference), but I didn't mind it too much. 

Service was great, feels like a small family place the folks in the neighborhood like to frequent. There was a building alarm that went off a few times, which according to the staff happens when someone in the building sets off the fire alarm (from cooking, etc). Sadly, the restaurant has no control over that. 

Would definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to eat with my sisters on a Friday night. When we went in, I thought there were two customers, but turns out one was the waiter and one was the cook haha

The service was great and so was the food. I got the pho soup. It was delicious, and the price was good (only about $7 for the small, which was plenty). 
I can't remember the names of the meals my sisters got, but one was noodles with beef and salad, and the other got chicken with rice and salad. I tried both and they were also delicious. I posted pictures. 

I don't go to this area of Montreal often, but Will definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Nice place, the Tonkinese Soup was pretty good. Full of MSG...head was pounding afterwards."}
{"text":"Cash only!

Super nice staff, good pho (get large!). Menu has a nice variety, not as large of a selection as other Vietnamese restaurants I'm used to but has everything I'd order at a Vietnamese restaurant anyway. 

The imperial rolls are small though and come two per order. Think again if you think you're sharing with me!"}
{"text":"The pho was delicious!! The food is not only well priced but high quality. The broth was very flavorful and comforting. It was the perfect way to start the day. We also got the ice coffee with condensed milk, it was very rich and tasted almost like a liquid hard coffee candy. If you have a sweet tooth I would definitely try the coffee. The service was also very quick and easy. You can sit and eat for an hour or grab a quick meal. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best bun bo hue I've had in Montreal... Cash only business...bla bla bla bla bla!!

Must try if your a spicy soup fanatic!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pho in Mtl.
Tasty, not too salty and fresh.
The owner is really friendly.
A must try in the city."}
{"text":"My boyfriend said, it's the best pho in Montreal. Because I'm vegetarian, they didn't provide vege food..."}
{"text":"I am not from Montreal and decided to make a trip from downtown to Sen Vang. As a big fan of pho and Vietnamese food, I highly recommend this place
-family run restaurant
-literally across the street from the Metro station
-got the Bun Bo Hue aka spicy noodles, which was delicious. Some have this as a secret menu item but I saw it on the menu. Get the large, its only $1 CAD more
-have also got the Pho Bac Diet aka #1 at most Pho restaurants previously, which was delicious as well with great broth; that being said you can get this at all Pho restaurants
-between the Bun Bo Hue and the Pho Bac Diet, I would go with the Bun Bo Hue because its different but tasty
-skip the Cha Gio aka Imperial Rolls. They are okay but nothing special
-staff is friendly. Feel free to ask them for the wifi code
-definitely worth the trip if you like Vietnamese food and are from out of town"}
{"text":"There are many pro's for this restaurant.

Here goes.

Location:
- Right across Métro Cote-Sainte-Catherine
- Easily reachable by Highway (near Decarie Highway)
- Parking is easy to find and free on Victoria Street

Food:
- Pho: Delicious and unique. You may think that all Pho taste the same, but I'm very pleased with their soup bowls. Generous quantity, prepared to perfection, soup was boiling hot every time I order a great bowl of pho.
- Haven't tried their Bun (Vermicelli) and Com (Rice) yet. I will re-review this in the future.

About the restaurant:
- Family owned business with professional service
- Can get very busy in lunch times, that doesn't bother me because it tells me that this place is popular and is great.
- Price range is exceptionally affordable.

Anyhow, this deserves a 4.75 star - and 5 is closest to it so I give it a five.

Definitely will be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Nous avons pris une soupe tonkinoise et un bun bo hue. Malheureusement, nous avons été très déçus. 

La soupe: beaucoup trop sucrée
Bun bo hue: pas assez piquant

L'endroit est propre (qui sent fortement le savon ce qui peut couper l'appétit), mais personnel très accueillant...ce qui a mis un baume sur l'expérience."}
{"text":"Beware: Cash Only!

Decent lunch place. I went there during lunch time and ordered a XL Pho Dac Biet like any Vietnamese person who is hungry (and yes, I was hungry). Having seen the reviews on Yelp, my expectations were fairly high. Let's just say that I was neither disappointed nor overwhelmed. The flavor of the broth was good, but nothing to write home about. The portion was generous, but mainly because i ordered an XL size bowl (which ended up costing about 12$ before tips). Lots of meat too. Overall, good lunch place!"}
{"text":"Sen Vang is a great Vietnamese place for those who crave something besides banh mi, as they offer various noodle dishes that are guaranteed to soothe the soul. From the common pho to combo rice dishes to bun bo hue, it is definitely a sit-down place that's great for those who want to try something new like I did the day I went.

I ordered the large bun bo hue (spicy beef noodle soup) with a Vietnamese iced coffee for my beverage. It took all but five minutes for the noodle soup to come out piping hot and chock full of various cuts of meat that would be unfamiliar to Western palates. For instance, there were your typical un-intimidating slices and chunks of beef, but there were also pieces of Vietnamese white sausage and coagulated pig's blood. Personally, the pig's blood didn't suit my tastes, but that's probably because it's an acquired one. The broth was still wonderfully seasoned and spiced (although I did need to add some spicy oil for that extra kick), and the noodles were bouncy and fresh and reminded me a lot of Guilin mifen that I would eat in China. The bean sprouts added that extra crunch that is always appreciated for texture purposes, and the lime juice made it tangy but not too sour. As always, the Vietnamese know how to make their iced coffee, so there's nothing new to say about how much I liked it!

Since I have friends who live in or are frequently around the Côte-des-Neiges area, I'll be sure to bring them here next time I'm in the area! After all, great food is always better consumed with great company."}
{"text":"You're stuck in the Canadian winter and looking for something to warm you up? Count on my words, a bowl of Pho soup will be your best friend 

Today, I passed by Sen Vang .. A tiny place which is located just in front of Metro Côte-Ste-Catherine (you can't miss it out! they have a big green billboard lol). I ordered a beef bowl of Pho. The ingredients are fresh, the meat is super tender and just the smell of if will make you salivate.

The service was fast.. Price including tax was about 10$.. The only advise I'd give you, they only accept payments by \"cash\"

Et bonne appétit!"}
{"text":"Excellent pho, grilled meat with rice, imperial rolls and vermicelli with options for small and large for noodle soup dishes.  We ordered Bon Bo Hue and it was delicious. It tasted authentic and had flavorful! They also have egg noodles! As for drinks, they had good Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk. The food was fresh but it took a little long to be prepared. The server was extremely kind and helpful. The restaurant is very casual and small. Highly recommended to anyone who likes Vietnamese food! The price is well worth it (~$7-9 depending on dish)."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far because I don't live very close to the location, but I will definitely be returning on atleast a monthly basis. I tried their Bun Bo Hue, and it was AMAZING. I would say it's in the top 2 I've ever had in Montreal. It was really hot, full of flavour and definitely authentic. 

The chef came out and even spoke to my boyfriend and I about how he tries to make the soup as authentic as possible and how he aims for the soup to be consistent every single time it is ordered (at some places when you go it can be good on one day, a tad watery or oily the next). He was very friendly and definitely showed a true passion for cooking.

It's going to be hard to even try anything else on the menu because I think I'll just keep on ordering the bun bo hue :)"}
{"text":"Location have decent price . Walking distances from our place. Close to the bus and train. Location looks clean and food is Fresco."}
{"text":"The imperial rolls were absolutely delicious and so was the pho (although a large one turned out to be way too much for me). Service was excellent too, I can only recommend this place!... Especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Authentic home made pandan jelly!! There was a guy who walked in an just ordered a bowl of pandan jelly with coconut milk. That's all. I had it in the tricolored dessert and it was really good! 

Their specialty soup and noodles was really good and their spring rolls were uber yummy!  

Their grilled beef noodles was just average as the portion of meat was very small and I think was pan cooked instead of grilled."}
{"text":"Great place for Bun Bo hue. For those who are not experienced in BBH it's a spicy beef noodle soup in a rich broth. Think of it as Pho's angrier cousin. Rich beef broth with noodles and a healthy spicy kick to it. Another way I can explain BBH is it's quite possibly the best way to clear a full sinus cavity. Thus it makes a delicious meal in the cooler months where we have those wet humid 0C to -10C days. You know the days I'm talking about.......where you feel chilled to the bone and you feel like curling up under a blanket or blasting the heat just to warm up. Go get a steamy bowl of Bun Bo Hue and PRESTO. Instant feel better. 

For those who are Vietnamese purists this is a delicious option in a town where Vietnamese food is plentiful. Absolutely I shall be back. Without a question. 

****** Word of caution. BBH is not a first date meal. It is only if you state ground rules that you eat like a hungry dog. 

****** Second word of caution. Don't wear a white shirt as those red oil stains (from the soup) are near impossible to get out. I made an impromptu bib out of paper towel (yes I'm comfortable in my own skin). 

Slurp it up. MEGA delish in every way!"}
{"text":"Just pure amazing - the owner was super friendly and the food was amazing.  We can tell that the food was cooked with warm heart.  

My husband and I are from Vancouver and we took the metro from downtown to this place - it was well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Located right in front the metro, went to try this place since our usual place was closed on Monday.  The Dac Biet was delicious! I'm usually picky when it comes to a good pho. But the broth was very tasty and the meat wasn't overcooked like some places. It was a nice,calm and clean place. WOULD RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"My new go to place for a good pho ! 
The broth is tasty, noodles are fresh, great cut of meat, the restaurant is a cute little place, clean with friendly staff.

Brought some take out home for the hubby and  he quickly noticed it wasn't from our usually spot and the mister said from now on we will get our pho fix from there lol.

Only downside is no fresh rolls, the menu is limited but I rather have a small menu with tasty dish over pages of ok food."}
