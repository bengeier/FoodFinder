{"text":"The food here is really good and you get plenty of it for what you pay. Initially looking at the prices i was little taken back but once the food came out i understood why. You get two meals for one and they are usually running a pretty good special."}
{"text":"It isn't fancy but a great place for families. Food was great. Prices reasonable. We didn't understand why there weren't more people there! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Venice is a blessing for a vegetarian dining in this area. There aren't a lot of quality restaurants to choose from in the first place, let alone ones that offer vegetarian options.   I've never been let down when dining here, and I've visited Venice countless times! I actually just brought from my grandmaw here this week for Easter lunch.  Venice gets big ups for having lots of booths (my favorite seating), but tables in between to accommodate big parties. I also really love the simple decor... the green walls being my favorite.  The service is always great, very sweet girls... frequently checking in to see how your food is or if you need a refill.  My favorite dish here is the Eggplant Parmesan Sub... delicious! The calzones probably come in 2nd, they're the bomb! My mom always gets the lasagna.  Definitely coming here again next time I'm in the Kannapolis area!"}
{"text":"It's closed. I went by there and they are relocating. THEIR owner is currently at new York pizza in kannapolis."}
{"text":"Always good food, prices are always very fair, never had a bad meal. The 2 for 22 is the best deal in town"}
{"text":"Freezing inside, was told the heat was on, but air was blowing down on us. Never could get comfortable, had to keep coat on the whole time. Food came out it tasted canned and pre made. Kitchen didn't fix the meal the way asked and my other diner had a hair in his spaghetti. Very very nice waitress, but will most likely not return to this resturant."}
{"text":"My father and I were in town for the weekend and, based on other user reviews on Yelp, decided to try Venice Pizzeria Italian Restaurant.  Parking at this restaurant can be tricky.  The restaurant was less than half full when we arrived; and, we were seated promptly.  We were given our menus and told that our server would arrive shortly.  We decided what we wanted to order shortly after being seated.  Fifteen minutes later, no servers approached our table to help - not even to take our drink order.  Since nobody seemed interested in serving us, we left.  Only as we announced \"We think we'll go elsewhere where we think we can get served,\" and were walking out of the restaurant did any of the wait staff make an effort to ask if we had been helped.  Considering Los Arcos Mexican Restaurant was next door, and was spoken highly of by others on Yelp, we decided to go there.  We were met with prompt, attentive, cheerful service and enjoyed a delicious meal.  If we're ever back in the area, we'll be sure to steer clear of Venice Pizzeria Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like green olives...THIS PLACE IS FOR YOU!!  First of all, I'm disappointed that NO ONE ever offers green olives as a topping for pizza anymore...they just don't do it!! Why, possibly because the universe discovered I'm love with them...but on to the food...  I had the pleasure of eating here Christmas Eve.  Now, my crew sneaked in at a quarter til closing time, but they win cool points for several reasons:  1. they were actually still open.  you know everyone else shut down at 6pm and it was almost 10 when we got there. 2. The wait staff was very patient and even though they were probably cussing us out in the back, our food was DELICIOUS, HOT, AND FAST. 3. They have GREEN OLIVES as a topping for pizza!! (really, this should've been number 1).  We all ordered their dinner special, which for 9.99 got us an appetizer, entree, and drink.  Now, certain entrees came with either soup, salad, or bread sticks, but you could add either for a nominal fee.  I got the personal pizza and it rocked!! Super yummo!  My husband got the lasagna and said it was almost better than mine (which i'll take because he LOVES my lasagna).  So, it's not a question of if I'll eat here again, it's when!!  Kannapolis is a bit of a drive...nonetheless, I'll be getting the pizza again...GREEN OLIVES, FTW!!! (WOOT)!"}
