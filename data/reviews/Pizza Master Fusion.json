{"text":"I am from BC, tried there pizza last week. When I made my call, I was greeted very well, I spoke to (I assume) the owner. She was very nice. When I arrived to pick up, I met the owner, again I was greeted and treated very well. The cashier and other employees did not say much. The 4 cheese master was amazing, the coral springs veggie master indian style was good. I highly recommend this place and will order there again when I return from BC."}
{"text":"Decided to try a new pizza place and so glad we did! This place has fantastic pizza with lots of different types to choose from as well as different crust options. We will be ordering from them again and again! Delicious!"}
{"text":"We purchased a groupon and thought we would try this interesting mix of counter service pizza and indian inspired flavours.  We tried the Tikka Chicken and the Chilli Chicken pizza as well as the Punjabi style wings.  Excellent flavour and quality ingredients.  If you enjoy indian spices and want a better quality pizza than panago and little ceasars, try Pizza Master Fusion."}
{"text":"This pizza is horrible, maybe it's because I'm from nyc. The pizza dough is similar to pizza hut, the wings had no flavor and the potato s skins had not flavor."}
{"text":"Small family run place that makes a thick and delicious and filling pizza. Lots of styles available, from traditional to unique fusion of flavour."}
{"text":"Their pizza is so good they are very reasonably priced, the crust they use is so good too, I'm thinking the crust is a naan bread because it's not like a regular doughy pizza crust, I have been there several times and it's been so good, I think they also have two different kinds of sauces as well because the first time we got pizza it had a tiny bit of spice to it then, the last few times it been different, both very good but different, we saw them and wanted to try something different I'm glad we did they areGreatreat"}
