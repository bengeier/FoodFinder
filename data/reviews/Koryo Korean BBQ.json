{"text":"Amazing customer service and amazing food! Had to drop off a friend to the airport from Tucson and I wish they had one in Tucson. Food was delicious with a lot of serving. Usually don't eat the sides but those were good too! Superb overall"}
{"text":"Oh man....this place has very good Korean food! My husband was so happy they had items other Korean restaurants do not serve. We will be coming back for sure. Kids loved and so did we!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and side dishes. Service was very slow. There was only one server. But never refilled our water until bringing us the check. Food made up for it. We will try it again and hopefully have better service. Used the $15 for $25 deal with no problem."}
{"text":"Come here often. So much so, when we walk in they already know what we want. Always friendly service and great food. My go to place for Korean food. Oh and they have Fish Cake daily!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a quiet, secluded atmosphere, Koryo is a great restaurant to visit along with it's Korean dish. They have great bimbibap around, but I've tasted better quality.  Their price range is about average. I would expect to spend money around $15.00. To those who live by Glendale, this is a great place to visit for college students who are up for a variety of Asian foods. Though, I personally would not recommend this place to those who are knit picky about spending and are on a budget."}
{"text":"I went out with the boyfriend and it was delicious. We had bulgogi and pork belly. We also enjoyed the side dishes that came with the meal. I'mma definitely bring my parents here someday."}
{"text":"Food: Okay (3 stars)

Service: Terrible!!! (0 star) Food came out very slow, given that there were only 2 tables at the time. The server did not write down my order. I asked my soup to be mild, but it came out spicy. I think all of the above was not very bad, until I asked for the check and told her that I would like to use the yelp deal. She brought me the bill and specifically requested me to tip her 18% of the original amount (before coupon). She even added that \"some customers don't understand you know. That's why I want to tell you\" I would have given her tip anyway, but for the service, totally not 18%, and of course, totally not 18% when she asked for it!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food was pretty good, service absolutely sucked. There were only a couple of other tables so it wasn't busy yet we couldn't get water/soda refills without flagging server down, and then she would walk right past without even acknowledging us. She would then maybe come back , maybe not. For 6 people we got small dishes of sides, aprox 1 bite per person and then we would attempt to get her attention again. Only got 3 of the sides ever refilled, once. We ordered 4 orders of beef and one pork belly. She brought 2 of beef and the pork and told us that because table was full she would bring the 2 other beef when we were ready. When we were ready, she told us that no, she had brought double orders of the beef, BS. Not only had she told us that we still had 2 orders coming but the plates she had brought the beef on were the same size as the single order of pork plate. \"4 orders\" of beef netted each of the 6 of us about 4 bites. We argued but she insisted that she had brought 4 orders. We then get the check and find that they add 18% gratuity to all parties of 5 or more. I know a lot of places do this for 8 or more but 5?? Though that does explain her crappy attitude and total lack of effort. Signed CC slip with a notation signing under protest and detailing shortage. As soon as charge hits bill, I will protest the charge."}
{"text":"I have been to the location in Sherway Gardens and two words; GARLIC POTATOES. Very good! You can't beat the prices and the ability to choose from the many sides (tofu, veggies, noodles ect.) instead of just getting a pile of bland rice is awesome. The short ribs are grilled nicely and are super tasty."}
{"text":"I love Koryo! The food is undeniably delicious and authentic. I had a chat with the owner while having lunch with my family. He was extremely hospitable and gracious. The food and service were excellent. We had the bulgogi lunch special (great value!), chambong, japchae, and yakiudon. All were good. But my favorite were the many side dishes they brought us! I am a kimchi addict and Koryo's kimchi was so good!

I would go back - hands down! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I was with a group of 17 people and we were traveling through Arizona and wanted Korean food and found this place that had such great reviews, however, once we got there, we were all beyond disappointed with their service and quality. When we arrived, we were reproved for not making reservations, which is fine because we had the time to wait. I ordered the spicy beef soup and when the order came, the flavor of the soup was so bland, it was basically water. We complained and got a new order of soup, but I was still not satisfied. A friend ordered the beef short ribs soup and when the order finally arrived about 30-45 min later, the meat in the soup was still frozen!!! We were all very disappointed with our orders. I DO NOT recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Sticky table. Waitress doesn't know when to give you a refill. Hot in the booths. A fly went by. Literaly. Pricey for the very small servings. Waitress didnt really understand English. Two thumbs down."}
{"text":"Also coming from LA and trying some of the best K Town and Rowland Heights spots I think it would be unfair to compare this place to those.  I don't know what it is but the overall quality of Phoenix Restaurants is just not up to par with what you can find in LA!  

Pulling into the old looking plaza we found signs displayed for Koryo customer parking only and they were all open!  So we walked in and the entire place was literally empty!  I mean no one customers or employees on the floor, so now I'm thinking MAJOR red flag right.  

Since this is the first Korean BBQ spot I could find (for miles and miles) of this area, we decided to brave the unknown and sat ourselves in a booth (where I nearly sunk in) and waited about a couple minutes.  BTW this was around 2pm so it was a late lunch for us. 

When the lady arrived she gave us the menus and I proceeded to ask her about the items...and well, since I couldn't understand her enough, I went with familiar items.  We went with Galbi (short ribs, can usually never go wrong here), vegetable tempura (normally see this at Japanese spots), an order of the Tofu pot (with pork stew and an egg), and finally Bibimbap (this is a Korean staple with vegetables, thin sliced beef, an over easy egg, mix it with your bowl of rice and the hot sauce). 

I must add the reason I love Korean BBQ and what separates the good from the bad is the quality of the Banchan (side dishes).  Our meal was served with cabbage kimchi, raddish kimchi, fish cake, seaweed, and a sliced radish with a sweet vinegar type sauce.  I have to say I actually enjoyed the meal.  

Then again when your the only customers in the place, then you should expect everything to be top notch right?  Well, it wasn't bad and it wasn't great, overall an ok experience."}
{"text":"Strongly not recommended this place!!!They had the banner of $7.99 udon soup with the choice of beef or chicken. I ordered that and the guy there charged me for combo price which is $12. So I told them they charged me wrong but they refused to refund me the difference. And the portion was really small, totally not worth the price"}
{"text":"Looking forward to Koryo BBQ, I trek through the downtown looking for the location in the Plus 15, mouth watering all the way.  I have gone out of my way to go to Koryo BBQ at the North Hill Mall and have never been disappointed.  I wish I could say the same for here.  Granted, I haven't been a bit, so maybe things are \"tough\" all over, but my lunch was just not what I was expecting.  The service was excellent, moving through the lunch-time line with speed and efficiency - all with a smile.  Generous portions of the sides (kimchi and green beans, as always).  The meat is where things got a little dicey.  The beef was not in steak portions, as I was expecting.  It was shredded, almost like the stirfry beef you get at a Japanese fast food joint.  And did not have that grilled flavour as it was poaching on a pan before reaching my rice.  They must be using the runt of the litter for the chicken portion (although the server did seem to be looking around to find a reasonable sized one).  And the chicken tasted off.  Both the chicken and beef did not have that nice marinated/grilled flavour I so much enjoy at North Hill, even dipped in the amazing pinkish BBQ sauce.

I think I will give this location a miss next time and check out the small Choices restaurant I passed on the way to Koryo which serves bulgogi beef at lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Only two people working. The only time the lady smile was when she receive the bill. Party of 9, and everyone wasnt satisfied. First and LAST time everrrr."}
{"text":"I was looking for an Asian eatery to take our Korean friend for her birthday lunch.  I found Koryo Korean BBQ in my Entertainment Guide then looked it up on Yelp to read the reviews. I then saw the $25 for $15 offer and decided to give it a go. 
Very quiet at noon on Tuesday. Place is nice, was clean and the man and woman that helped us were very friendly   After reading other reviews, I think they must be the owners. 
There were 5 of us, 4 that haven't eaten Korean food before so our server made a few suggestions. We ordered 2 appetizers, Jap Chae and vegetable Tempura both  delicious and arrived piping hot. 
For our main course we ordered Bul-Go-Gi and Daeji Bul-Go-Gi both were cooked on the table hibachi and served with several small bowls of  condiments.   A very tasty meal enjoyed by all. 
No problem with the Yelp coupon either."}
{"text":"Good food horrible service. It was like the waitress was doing us a favor with everything she did. When we asked to split the check \"It'll be done tomorrow.\" With eyes rolled. Not good"}
{"text":"Tried the location in Scarborough Town Center. First of all, the portions are unreal. I ordered the Jumbo Combo, and it came with 4 sides, rice, short ribs, beef flank, chicken, and fried dumplings. The container could not even close.

The garlic fried potatoes were fantastic... lots of flavor, and semi-sweet. Short ribs were very tender, and juicy. Chicken was slightly dry, but still good. Price is amazing for mall food court type... that Jumbo Combo was only $9.99. My wife ordered the Daily Special, which was 2 sides, rice, and two big slabs of beef flank steak. $6.99 including a can of pop!

All and all, great deal, an great quality food!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today. It was our first time here at Koryo.  Julie (our hostess/server) was so welcoming when we arrived and she was super sweet. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere. The food satisfied our Korean food cravings. We live not too far from here and we used to go to Ohya but my husband doesn't think it's as good as it used to be. Glad we found another place nearby. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I haven't had KBBQ In years! And i was craving it so i was looking and saw this place with the highest rate. I went here today and i can say this is the BEST KBBQ I have had in my life! Friendly and great! Im coming here again thats foresure! Great costumer service!"}
{"text":"I had the worst experience there. The lady who was the servant she was very unhappy person. I called and did reservation for our family and she said on the phone that they were very busy and then we went there and actually wasn't busy at all. We say no one came asked us anything after 15 minutes lady came asked for our drinks then she was gone and came asked what we had to ordered one of us wasn't sure what to choose and then the lady said very rudely we had to order faster and making quickly because she was busy and don't have time for us I looked at the lady and said sorry but we are here to eat and you have to be patient with your customers. The food wasn't good like other Korean restaurant I been and it was my first time and last time there because I hate when I go somewhere and people are rude. I almost got out of there without eating but I didn't because I felt bad for others. I even gave them tips because I am not a rude person."}
{"text":"Just like many others, the waitress didn't accept my coupon. I was upset, but I let it go, the food was okay, but I should've listened to all the other bad reviews and saved my money to get better customer service. This is the first time I don't tip a waitress and I didn't feel guilty about it. Why? Because we were the only 2 people having dinner on a Tuesday night, and she should've at least provided excellent customer service. Not once did she come out to check on us. No refills on anything.  Definitely never coming back. 

Ps. Don't go on a hot day, they have fans, no AC."}
{"text":"First, Yelp is LIER. Restaurant is LIER either.
I did purchase $15 for $25 deal. Their policy to use this deal is 1 time, 1 table and expire in 1 year. They did not say I have to order minimum $50 to be able to use that deal. The server told me that deal only works with order from $50. What is the fucking lier !!!
Second, restaurant is very very stinky. They serve BBQ without fan like what I always see at another Korean BBQ restaurants. 
Third, they gave me just a few different dishes of kimchi. Looking cheap!!
I love Korean food and I did try many Korean restaurants, but this time I was definately dissapointed. Food is bad, service is bad....
DO NOT COME THERE !!!"}
{"text":"Food was OK. Service sucked. Wouldn't take any of the deals even though they don't say that its limited to dinner only."}
{"text":"The service was not the best, but what does one expect from a \" Mom & Pop\" Korean shop?  The upside was the food; probably one of the best Korean BBQ places in the Valley at the moment. Try the beef tongue.. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were craving Korean. She has been to Korea and into Hawaii so it's safe to say we know our food. This place has the MOST sour tasting food ever! The kimchi was terrible and that is our favorite every where we go! There was no one here but I had to get up to find the waitress for a check which was WAAAAYYY overpriced for untasty food. Save yourself the trouble!"}
{"text":"This is a really good korean bbq place. The bulgogi literally melted in my mouth, and all the sides were really tasty. The waitress was very attentive and helpful. I'll definitely come back here when I'm back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Sushi is great Korean food is good!!! It has a great atmosphere!! All of the staff here is really friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Korean food!!! Very pleasant service.  Definitely will return again!!! So glad to have found this place."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service. me and my group of 8 fellow college students were trying kbbq for the first time. It was delicious! I had the bulgogi dolsot bibimbap and it was great! Everyone else had just the regular bulgogi. Only thing was that talking with the waiter was a little difficult because she did not speak fluent english but I also know that talking to 8 18-21 year olds isnt easy either. Thank you Koryo! We will be back after winter break!"}
{"text":"First time going to a Korean restaurant and I'm impressed. Service was great... they recommended food based on other things I told them I like.  Will be back for more! One too though... when they say it's a little spicy.. they mean a lot! Lesson learned! Lol"}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Food was good but not the best.OHYA was still better.  We're  a family of six so by default the waitress already knew the tip (18%) was something she didn't have to work to get...and she didn't. 

We all placed our orders together,  yet my husbands pancake came in like 15 minutes before ours. When the rest of us got our food,  the waitress put out 3 forks.  3 forks for 6 people! When i asked for more forks she said she already brought them. I let that go,  sorta,  but only because my husband  and son were attempting to eat with the two chopsticks that were already set out.  I got a beer in the very beginning. Not once did she offer another one or perhaps something else to drink.  Maybe some freaking water woulda been nice. We even had to ask for the soft drinks refills.

 When we paid our bill of 102.89 (tip included) the waitress took forever  to get our change.  We gave her $120. She came back with $17. We weren't about to give her another cent more. We asked  for my coins.  When she came back she only gave us 6 cents!  This whining isn't about miniscule change. Its about the right thing....get it right!  I asked for my 5 cents.  When she handed it over she just tossed it on top of some menus.  Horrible attitude.  I don't understand. She made her tip as soon as we walked in.  Maybe we should have expected that kind of service.  We're never going back."}
{"text":"Now I can see why there's barely any line up here. My boyfriend had their chicken and beef \"bbq\" and it's the easiest way to throw your money. It's NOT FRESH AT ALL. The glass noodle is stale and hard, the meat is ridiculously small for $13 it will make you mad. The potatoes are hard as well. They're too cheap to replace their food when it's all stale and hard. Also, the meat was not heated up properly I guess. I don't think you can grill or even heat up meat in under a minute.  I assure you I will never go back here and everyone in my network."}
{"text":"Went to Ohya earlier in the day for Korean BBQ and sushi with a party of 12 and they had poor service, the grill tops didn't work and we wanted Korean BBQ so we ended up leaving and going to Koryo. The service at Koryo was great! Both grill tops worked and they were able to accommodate to a large party. We had 7 kids and 5 adults. There was a soup I really wanted and the waitress actually customized my order but it originally just came with tripe. It was delicious. Overall the food was delicious and service was great and a reasonable price for such a large party. The kids also loved it! Love this place and will continue to come here with the family!"}
{"text":"1st time here, after we finished eating in the restaurant we noticed some gnats or fruit flies flying all around some of the dishes and the bbq area. That was years ago. I didn't want to write a bad review because honestly, in most eateries you may run across this from time to time. However, I got desperate one night recently when our normal go to place was closed and got take out this time. While I was eating, I noticed a LIVE creepy crawly guy in one of the side dish containers that I had just eaten out of...this place has a vermin problem. I'm still washing my mouth out. I'm Korean, and I love Korean food and would love to support all the Korean food establishments in the area, as there are not that many and I would love to see more. But I cannot overlook what is clearly a bug problem, sorry Koryo, I honestly tried to like it here..."}
{"text":"Poor value! They're extremely chinsy on the amounts they give especially the meat. The food doesn't taste very good either. Completely bland and tasteless compared to what real Korean food tastes like. Yes, I know it's fast food but this poor quality is unacceptable. There are better choices in the food court."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times now. I always go with my boyfriend who is half Korean. We have tried several of their menu items and both us being well versed in Korean cuisine agree that the food is always delicious. I have only been disappointed once by their food, and that was when I order the Hae Do Bap(pardon the spelling) which is sashimi over salad and rice with a spicy korean sauce. The sashimi was served to me still partially frozen which I thought was quite horific, not to mention I was seriously craving Hae Do Bap that evening so that was a huge let down. The service is alright  nothing fantastic and nothing terrible. The waitress we usually get seems quite bored which can throw off the mood sometimes, but I overlook it because the food still comes in a timely fashion and is always tasty (except that one time of course).

Now recently I've been taking my mom and step father there for dinner and they enjoy it as well. My mom always gets the seafood tofu soup (Hael Mul Soon Doo Boo?) and my step father gets korean barbecue. He has fun being able to grill up his food and rolling the meat up in lettuce wraps. The portions are never an issue, every item so far is perfect for one person and sometimes two depending on how hungry the individual is.

In short, food is great, just don't get that sashimi salad I was talking about! Service is alright which is why I am giving the place four stars. I will definitely continue to eat here. I suggest they work on their service though since it seems like that's the main complaint from everyone else!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit here and it was even more amazing than the first and that's only because I saw more of the lovely server this time. The food has been excellent the both times I've been there, I have absolutely no complaints. =) We ordered:

- Galbi (comes with 2 long pieces- more than most places)
- Beef tongue (a whole plate) 
- Spicy pork (full plate- more than most places) 
- Kimchi tofu soup (lots of tofu) 

I included the size/amount description because most people know that Korean cuisine is pricier than others and not many Korean restaurants offer a portion proportional or equivalent to price, but this place offers **great portions** and **more banchan** (Korean side dishes) than we would ask for. The server is very friendly and is very attentive to our refill needs in drinks and banchan. 

There are also a lot of tables and space for multiple large parties and enough tables for self bbq with the gas grill which is a major plus!!!! :) 

With all this being said, this is my new **favorite** Korean spot and I will definitely return with larger parties ;)"}
{"text":"This place smelled good walking in; it was like kalbi heaven. We actually had decent service, probably because I started speaking Korean with the server.

We came for lunch because I'm on the hunt for a stellar jajjangmyun. I'd heard that their kimchee was delicious and was encouraged to try their food. So far, they have the best jajjangmyun that I've tasted in a while. But, it's still nothing compared to what's offered in Seattle. 

My husband ordered the fried rice which was kind of sad. The rice was way too mushy as though it had been soaked in water for too long. It also tasted very bland. In fact, on our way out, we passed by an empty table that hadn't been cleared off yet. There was a large plate of the fried rice and it hardly looked like it had been eaten from. 

Every thing had this weird but subtle after taste. It was in the jajjangmyun. It was also in the Coke I was drinking. It reminded me of traditional Chinese medicine, and how bitter it is. I tasted it in the fried rice, and my husband's diet Coke, too. My husband noticed it, too."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!!! They screwed up our order and tried to blame us. Then she short changed me on my order. The food was small and tasteless. Will never come back to this dump."}
{"text":"The service was okay. It seemed like it was just the owner and maybe one other person doing everything. The place was empty and we waited roughly ten minutes for someone to get us a table. I don't have that much of a problem with the wait, but it was a little strange to me. I'm not entirely sure if he was the owner but the person who served us was apologetic for the wait. No big deal.

The food itself was, in my honest opinion, so-so. We did the self-cook grill table type thing. I'm not that experienced in the method yet, but I know what tastes good to me and what doesn't. The bul go gi was good, but the chicken was disappointing. It's not horrible, but I'm just not a fan of squishy chicken. The side dishes were good, but not all that amazing either. Maybe I'll go back to try something else."}
{"text":"We saw a blurb in the Arizona Republic and decided to try this place before going to a play downtown.  We showed up at 5:30 on a Saturday evening and there was no one in sight to seat us.  After walking further into the place, we saw a man seated in a booth working on paperwork.  After asking they were open and he nodded yes, we still had to wait for someone to seat us.  Seeing we were the only ones in the place should have been our first clue as to what was to come.  The waitress was not friendly, but did take our order in a timely manner.  There were four in our party, and three of us ordered BBQ, the forth ordering soup.  Our friend liked his soup, but the rest of the meal was a disaster.  We ordered short ribs, and the meat was tough and chewy.  When told to the waitress, she proceeded to take half of it (it was two large slabs of thinly cut meat that had been attached to a bone) back to the kitchen, returning in a minute or so to tell us there was nothing wrong with the meat.  The chicken BBQ was ok, but had little seasoning.  The shrimp was dry, and the teriyaki sauce came cold.  Sides did not look appetizing, and 2 of 4 people didn't even try them.  This place won't last long."}
{"text":"My brother recommended this restaurant as he said he had been here once before and the service was good. This is one time I wished I would have listened to the Yelp reviews. We had a party of 5 and there was barely any customers. We were seated promptly and got our drinks pretty quick and things went down hill from there. We began to order our food and were informed we can't use the grill because they have a group that has a reservation, mind you that we were there for almost 2 hours and we never saw the group. 3 of us ordered bulgolgi and 2 of us ordered fried rice. The bulgolgi was cold when it came out like they cook a batch then serve it when needed, the hot plate wasn't even hot it was cold. The fried rice was very bland and loaded with frozen mixed vegetables that tasted generic. The waitress was extremely rude. Only one person got a drink refill and that was after asking 2 times then she replies I heard you and walks off before we could finish telling her what else we needed. We asked for a fork 2 times and the second time being asked she waved us off and said yeah yeah. When she returned with the fork someone else at our table needed one (because she rushed off again before we were done talking) and she seemed disturbed by this and said you really need a fork. There was a man standing at the front waiting for his check for 15 minutes. The table next to us was ready for their ticket as well and the rude waitress was nowhere to be found. My brothers got up and walked to the kitchen to find her so everyone could leave. She finally brings the check and then magically she was around coming out frequently to collect. I bought the $15 for $25 deal and told her I would be using it and she said why didn't I tell her before. I told her it's hard to tell someone something when they don't listen and aren't around. The table next to us had the same complaints as well and said they wouldn't be returning either. I could honestly say I would never return to this establishment again."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good! All the negative reviews didn't apply. The portions was large enough to make me very full and content. The flavors were great and service was just as good. The bulgogi was right on. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I would have given the restaurant a 5 star but at the last moments of our stay the waitress was rude when I presented the coupon I bought through yelp. She grabbed my phone and slammed it on the table when looking at the code and told me, \"You should have told me.\" Oh and Btw they brought the bill without asking of I wanted something else."}
{"text":"Craving for a KBBQ with some friends and I have yet to find a really good one here in AZ, because as much as I love making a trip to L.A. for some good food, I would also like to try what AZ has to offer. So I came upon this restaurant on yelp and I saw some really good pictures and sure why not try it. When we entered we didn't get seated for about ten minutes and it wasn't that busy but once we sat ourselves the waitress lady asked what our order was going to be. But how do we know what to order when we didn't get the menu?
So she then realized we needed a menu.

Its not an all you can eat korean bbq but the food was good and yeah I was pretty hungry too.. And we were sweating like it was freakin hot inside; depended on an electric fan. You see KBBQ in L.A. make me want more, but I wasn't feeling that I wanted more on this one. I had a Dr. Pepper but it tasted like it had been watered down.

Why a 2-star? Because we asked if we could do separate checks or if she could split payment of what amount we would like to be taken off out of our cards, but she just replied, \"You see you ordered this so that's how much for you and that for you and that is how much for you!\" I guess she didn't understand us and told us how much we have to pay and yeah we understood that but jeez you don't have to be so angry lady.

At the end I just paid for the whole meal. The lady demanded more tip which pissed me off with the one I gave her. Maybe if the service and her attitude didn't suck I would have. That is the first time that has happened to me. First worst experience at a KBBQ here.

Craving BBQ? Sure why not come here, but its not an all you can eat korean bbq and maybe you'd have a better experience than I ever did."}
{"text":"To be fair the food is excellent.I think this place has a difficult time forecasting their customers (I.e type and quantity). It could be a bunch of Korean guys craving a certain dish or it could be someone who never tasted Korean food before. Most of the reviews are hit or miss. I came at a bad time and almost left, but the food did make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for my order. Don't assume because the line is short that they will hustle. Beef was fatty.  The taste was good though. I used to love this place, but they've been going downhill."}
{"text":"We were turned away at the door.  They stated our party of six was too large. My husband looked around the dining area.  It was only 1/3 full.  I have never experienced this before anywhere.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Don't listen to the lady who will tell you about a $25 off discount if you spend more than $50. They need to be on the same page with the customer. I specifically asked her if I could use the $15 for $25 offer but she scammed me into using the 10% off discount instead which was a lot less of a deal and kept saying she already pressed the 10% and its the wrong coupon. WASTED MY MONEY!!!!  I was mad because I showed her the coupon BEFORE WE ORDERED and she said ya ya thats the one I can give you $25 off if you spend more than $50. The Galbi was $25 and not seasoned well. She didn't refill our bowls after she left to sit and talk to her coworker on a different table either."}
{"text":"The food is alright but the portions are great, especially if you order the combo meal. There must have been 5 sides that came with my food and I paid less than $10. Occasionally there may be a fly or two that will circle around your food. But who doesn't have those right? The servers are your typical Asian servers, indifferent yet friendly. Apparently it has a new name and now has cooking tables where you can grill your food. It's somewhat disappointing to say that this new and improved restaurant is still the same as it once was."}
{"text":"I won't be back. It just didn't make it. It seemed overpriced for the food amount given. I know kalbi is pricey, but geez; I'd expect more on a plate for the price. The waitress took forever to get our check. I literally left the table and waited near the entrance area."}
{"text":"Out of many, the food at this location is good....But extremely cheap on their sides. You can always see blank spots on your plate. Potato, sprouts are cheap! They give so little. I hate that most. They actually remove food off your plate if they feel they gave a couple of pieces of potatoes to much. That is why i gave it 2 stars. I hate places that wants you to pay but gives you small amounts. On the photo the jumbo comes with 3 dumplings, they always give only 2. The young girl that works there is never happy to be there and is not pleasant and just seems to be annoyed when you tell her what you want."}
{"text":"The place was completely empty when my boyfriend and I stepped in. As in we were the only people their besides the owners. The owner was really nice. For only just them working food came out pretty fast. We chose to grill our own bbq. Portion sizes are ok. The meat is thin and I like that so you don't get tired of it. We weren't planning on eating much anyways, but that helped us aha. Place is really clean. It's not bad for kbbq that you grill for yourself over here in AZ. One big plus though! It's not terribly smokey like Takamatsu!!!"}
{"text":"After driving about 4-5 hours and finishing a Mission trip, we had about 4 hours of free time until our flight. We were in the mood for some Korean food and after searching on Google we found this place. The reviews were not bad so we decided to eat there. Although we didn't make reservations, and maybe should have since we had a group of about 15, when we got there the lady was very surprised by the large group. She was complaining that we didn't call beforehand to make reservations, but it wasn't that busy, maybe 3 tables with a maximum of 4 customers. I know Korean restaurants in Dallas (where I am from) are busy on Friday nights. We told her that we are sorry and told her our situayion. As we sat down and looked at the menu I was very excited and couldn't choose what to eat. I was stuck between the Bulgogi and Ddukk Mandoo Gook (rice cake with dumpling soup) you can't go wrong with Bulgogi, but since I had it the night before at the mission trip I decided to go with the soup. This is where it all starts... As we were ordering, she got through our table/group with had about 10 people. When she got to the other table, she started complaining that we shouldn't order individual items and that it's going to take like an hour to get our food out. We repeatedly told her that it's okay, take your time, we have plenty of time. But she had an attitude. It felt like since it was a couple of hours before closing, they didn't want to work and serve customers. If you have that kind of mindset, you shouldn't run a restaurant at all. 
After all that ordering chaos I thought everything was gonna go smoothly and maybe we would have a nice chit chat and get to know more about each other since we're both Koreans from two different cities. But as the side dishes and rice came out, she only served 1 table, handed out rice to a few, left the tray (still with rice on it) on the empty table next to us, and one of the rice bowls had some red liquid stain on the rice, I wanna say it's from the Kimchi. 
When I got my Ddukk Mandoo Gook, it looked delicious. I tried it and that first sip burned my throat, not because of the temperature but because it was basically black pepper. It wasn't bad, but it was the most peppery soup I have ever tasted. I think I drank 3 cups of water and the Dumpling didn't have that much flavor, or because of the black pepper I couldn't taste anything. Another one of my members got the Galbi Tang (Beef Short Rib Soup). That took almost an hour to come out and when it did, the beef was completely frozen on the inside! That's when we all had it. If you're gonna complain that it's gonna take a long time for our foods to come out and we tell you that we have alot of time, at least cook the food! In the end, we weren't charged with that item but that will be the last time we will be visiting this restaurant. We go on a mission trip to Arizona every summer and thought maybe this restaurant could be our annual stop, but nope not after this horrible experience. We finished and payed for our meals and left a tip and pray that we will be the last customers who experience this."}
{"text":"The service was okay, but this place was a total rip-off, even with the Yelp \"deal\" we purchased.  Meals were greatly overpriced and you are required to buy two plates of meat to use the BBQ (despite the fact that we ordered additional items).  The quality of the meat was lacking, and the garnishes that I tried were far from delicious.  The \"fried\" tofu was soggy and tasteless.  I was excited for my first venture into Korean BBQ - but my search will have to continue.  This meal - and hit to my wallet - was one I'll be trying to forget."}
{"text":"Dropped in at the last minute on a weekday for an early dinner. This was my first time eating Korean Style BBQ. The food was a little slow coming. When we finally received our sizzling bowls the waitress was very nice and suggested how to mix and add the sides provided. 
The food was flavorful and it was a perfect. This is a cute date night place. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. I will go back for another round soon."}
{"text":"truth be told we really enjoyed the experience. 

my advice: give it a go. we've been to many korean bbq places and this was a solid 4 stars. 

to address other people's comments and concerns. 

1. yes, the wait staff was a only one lady. so chill out if she is busy with another table! she was very pleasant, helpful and accommodating. we went on a monday and there were only a couple other tables so we didn't have to wait long. over all she was awesome. 

2. the grills on the table have a fan built into them. one other comment was doggin them about the smell and the smoke. we turned on the fan on the sides of the grill and we didn't have any problem. 

3. yes it was a little drive out of the way from central phx, but there isn't a closer korean bbq in town so the drive wasn't terrible up the 17. 

4. for a table of 4 we ordered for following for a total of 113 dollars. 

    -appetizer: edamame and gyoza

    - bbq: two orders of brisket, on marinated pork        
       and one pork belly. the best was the brisket 
       and the marinated pork
    - side of kimchi rice
    - 4 hite

all in all the food was really great. the banchan (side dishes) we okay. the service was not super fast but attentive and friendly. remember korean bbq is not a fast dining experience. take your time and cook your meats and hang out. 

we loved the experience and will go back."}
{"text":"This is one of our family's favorite haunts. We enjoy the authentic experience of grilling our own meats (2 orders minimum). Even when it is just my teenage son and myself, we get 2 orders of bulgogi. Onion is rubbed over the grill. We drape our lovely paper-thin ribeye shavings over the onion and grill. We grill garlic as well. While we wait for the meat, we treat ourselves to japchae, glass noodles with vegetables and marinated meat. 

When we are with a bigger group, we have enjoyed the spicy pork and galbi. The kimchi chigae was alright, not our favorite, but okay. We enjoyed drinking soju and have never been disappointed.

We love the variety of banchan (side dishes) offered. The restaurant is generous if you wish to have more banchan, just ask chef or the waitstaff."}
{"text":"My stomach was punching itself from the inside with such a busy morning at work I couldn't wait until the clock hit so I could scurry over to the +15's to meet my lunch partner and hit up Koryo.

I've had Koryo just about everywhere so I was curious to try this location out. As I approached the staff were tentative, smiling and got through the ordering process quickly and with ease.

I ordered the BBQ Beef that comes with two ice cream scoops of Rice, my sides were Garlic Potatoes and Broccoli. I freaking love the Garlic Potatoes or whatever they are called usually at the other Koryo locations. I could probably eat a whole plate of those only. The potatoes today though however felt really stiff and usually they are softer when you bite down on them.

I don't know if it was because they had made them earlier in the day awaiting the lunch time rush or what but I mean it was good just not as good as it usually is. The BBQ Beef tasted the same as usual, looked the same as usual I don't have any complaints there.

Also Broccoli is Broccoli so I was a happy camper chomping down on mini trees."}
{"text":"One of the most satisfying Korean bbq's I had in while. Food was good, price is reasonable and the staff were nice and helpful. Definitely would come back again. I would definitely come back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sadly, as much as I love this place. I was so disappointed. The owners who are lovely people. They do a wonderful job, with custom service and quality of the food. 

They are on vacation,  which they deserve.  
The lady they have working, just is not personable, to say the least. 

She did under most of what I asked her. 
My soda ran out, I had to ask for a refill. Which I never have to do with the owners.

Still love this place, but will be happy when owner is back."}
{"text":"Im from Los Angeles, and this place DID NOT DISAPPOINT! GREAT FOOD and it is a family owned restaurant. It is well kept, clean and the owner Billy and his wife were just great people. Whether you want to come alone and satisfy your Korean BBQ craving, or come with a ton of friends, this is the place to be! The service was on point, and i felt right at home, and you could tell that the meat you were eating was quality meat.

Loved this pace. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Tried at the first time. It was good, but bit pricey. When we tried to use the coupon (10% off for $25 or more from Yelp), our server told us that she has $10 off for $50 or more orders, unfortunately our order was about $40, we couldn't use it. However, we could have use the 10%, but just because we did not tell her at the beginning, we couldn't use it. I thought that's a lie.
The server's English was not really good."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this new restaurant but realized it's not so great after sitting down.

1.  The service was slow and the waitress only came by twice despite the fact that there was no one else in the restaurant.

2.  When I ordered the food and it didn't come out as I had expected I was fine with  the soup instead of the bento bowl.  I asked for an egg and the waitress wrinkled her face and asked why do I want an egg.  Lots of Korean dishes have eggs in them.  All she needed to do was just give me one.

3.  I did the yelp check in at this restaurant to get the discount, but the server and restaurant owner refused to give me the discount.  Their customer service is not great. If they'd given me the small discount I would have come back and even told my friends about it.  Now I'm going to tell my friends not to come at all.

The food was all right but the poor customer service really turned me off this place."}
{"text":"Place is very quiet food was ok. Great deal on Yelp discount $15 for $25 bills. As far as food it was a fair price but, taste wise not too intrigued."}
{"text":"I happened to be in Glendale on business and checked Yelp for restaurants that were running special deals, and found Koryo.  Upon entering the restaurant my nostrils were assaulted by the strong smells of food cooking in a stuffy room with poor ventilation.  After about 30 minutes my nose adjusted, but the initial whiff was unpleasant.  The restaurant was sparsely furnished and could use an upgrade to get more business in the door, but otherwise was passable.  

The service was friendly and the menu had standard items available in a Korean restaurant.  The food, however, was the main event, and I wasn't thrilled.  I ordered a Bim Bim Bop with beef and the beef was chewy and tasteless.  The greens in my meal tasted fresh and crisp, but they could not save the overall tastelessness of the entire dish.  I actually spat out the mushrooms because I had spent too much time chewing on them.  The Kimchi was a similar disappointment.  I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. All the food is frozen or stale. I've had traditional Korean food and this place is a disappointment. Who ever runs this franchise should be ashamed. 

Avoid this place as possible unless you want throw away your money or possibly food poisoning."}
{"text":"This was by far one of the worst experiences ever. My family went in for dinner on a Friday night and there was no one there, four tables were covered with dirty plates and the service was terrible. I choked on the the chicken because it was all fat. I don't often recommend not going somewhere however if your in the area save your time and money because this place is a train wreck. Wouldn't be surprised if it's closed in a month. Gordon Ramsey couldn't even turn this place around."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????2?30??????????????????????????2???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I haven't visited this location of Koryo for a very long time.  When I used to patronize this place, however, I always enjoyed my meals.  We can only hope that Lana P's experience was an isolated one.

It would be helpful if someone else could chime in and let us know what's going on there right now."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, but service was pretty slow. There was a big party in the private room, so my group of three was apparently low priority. I was also hoping to be able to use the barbecue at our table, but that was apparently \"not working\" so we had to settle for (delicious) kitchen-cooked bulgogi.

I'd give the place 3.5 stars if I could, but the food was good enough I'm rounding up."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought Me here on a date. My first time here and I would say the experience was good, the service was good and the food is delicious. I think the only thing they Lack is that they only have one waitress for the whole restaurant. I do recommend it to go and taste the food there."}
{"text":"Never have I experienced such appalling customer service at any establishment! 

The boyfriend and I take on the 45 minute drive to Peoria from Goodyear after having some serious cravings for Korean BBQ. We walk in around 12:30 pm and expect a wait since it should be the peak of lunch rush. Instead, the ENTIRE restaurant was empty and continued to be empty from the time we arrived to the time we left. The only waitress there sat us down in a booth, gave us menus and took our drink orders, only saying about two words during the entire exchange. After the food arrived, she quite literally threw the food in front of us then left, never to be seen or heard from again. My boyfriend wanted a beer but she was gone and there was nobody else in the restaurant to help us either, After eating, we sat there for 15 minutes waiting for her to come by and give us the check. Of course, she didn't come back so we decided to do her job for her and physically get up just to hunt her down. She was sitting on a table on the lower level watching TV! Let me rephrase that, she was doing absolutely nothing and couldn't bother to check on us when we were the ONLY people in the store.

What really pushed me over the edge was that after my boyfriend and I decided to split the check, she demanded a tip from each of us. On the receipt, theres a \"recommended\" percentage that we should tip and she shoved my check back in my face after I didn't give her enough. I really just wanted to blow up at this point because how DARE you demand a tip for horrendous customer service! She 

Like many people on this page, I too had trouble redeeming the Yelp deal because the bill wasn't over 50 dollars. I wont go into too much detail about how unprofessional that is. The food here is good and without all this trouble with the deal and the waitress, this place could potentially have five stars."}
{"text":"I have been to 12-15 Korean BBQ Restaurants when i lived in LA. My best bud was Korean and we ate it all the time. Koryo was the worst Korean BBQ experience i have ever had, Slow service, over priced and they made you feel like you were bothering them for service. $160 for dinner for 4 was way over the top. The place was virtually empty , that should have tipped us off."}
{"text":"So I read many of the reviews before deciding to come (even some negative ones)...  I have to say that I disagree with some of the negative hospitality reviews!  I have a theory that sometimes we need to  understand cultural differences when patronizing establishments that are culture specific.  So I don't expect the same type of service in a place like this that I would at like a Flemining's...  Regardless, the lady that served us was awesome!!!  And when she found out it was my wife's bday she followed up dinner with a little ice cream sundae with a candle in it!  Very well done!!!  We will certainly be. Ack again for this tasty Korean BBQ place!!!"}
{"text":"Very welcoming staff & owner. Food was good and plentiful. Serves sushi too. Great 1st experience with Korean BBQ."}
{"text":"4.5 star. 

Its a really nice place visually; however they are missing something really important! They dont have soy sauce, pepper, or salt ready on the tables. Its a little inconvenient compared to other places ive been. 

The vegetables are probably re-used and look a little old. It definitely isnt completely fresh. 

The meat was marinated well though and tasted realllyyyy goooodddfd. Hats off to the chef. foshixzle.

Looking at the bar, it doesn't have a variety of drinks, just korean drinks n some American beers.  

The food taste delicious."}
{"text":"I rarely give 2 stars for a restaurant but something needs to be brought up for attention.
First I waited for half an hour to be seated because there is no one at the front desk. I had to go look to their kitchen and found waitress there and ask to be seated.
Second, the waitress can't really understand English. I tried to order pork belly, and I got marinated beef! Woo hoo! Talking about confusion here. 
Third, the food came sooooo late, I stayed in the restaurant for 3 hours!! That was a loooonnngg hour of waiting.. and finally I figured the reason why I had to wait for a long time: THEY ONLY HAVE 2 (two) PEOPLE and those two works as front desk, waitress and also chef in kitchen!! BINGO! 

The food was good but I really need a faster service.."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I bought the yelp deal, and when I was in there, she said they have nothing to deal with yelp, and demand is to just sit down and ordered.. there is no one there on a Sunday night, the waitress was rude. I wish I could leave negative star"}
{"text":"The food size definitely does not match with pictures displayed. The chicken and beef are so tiny ! Very disappointed and the food is cold too. For 12.99, I better off spend on some other place."}
{"text":"Okay I don't write very many bad reviews. Ever. But don't try this place. I'm never coming back. My friend and I come here and they're dead. They had just opened like 18 minutes prior. But there's obviously a reason for that. Then she stands there while we are looking at the menu. And after that I looked at the reviews and really wished I had looked before coming in.  normally I do. I just got excited to try Korean food. Nope. Not a good place. Then she goes away and we decide. Oh, also we asked for lemon with our water. We never got it. If they don't have it, that's fine but she should have said that. So she takes our order and brings it and then doesn't come and care to any of our needs. Then we're sitting there for 10 minutes waiting for her to come over so we can pay. we wanted to split the check. And very rudely she said we couldn't do that. I don't recommend coming here. Food was alright. But it's dead. The lady was rude and annoying and doesn't know how to care to customers. I was a waitress, so I know. And the prices are reticulum for how mediocre the food and service was. I won't be coming back. Save yourselves the bad experience and waste of money."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that makes you fight with your friends because you're so agitated. Food is good. Service is awful and dinner ended up taking 3 hours !!!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place closes down and opens under a new name every 3 months or so. 
Good luck trying to be seated when you walk in. There's no one to be found. If and when you do find someone, they're back in the kitchen doing god knows what. 
Then when you get seated it takes like 30 minutes to get your drink (even when the restaurant is completely empty).
A word to the wise, when they take your drink order, put in your food order because your going to be waiting at least another 30 minutes for that. 
Oh, and forget about drink refills here. They're unheard of, just like seeing the waitress again after she delivers your meal. When your done eating and want your check you have to go hunt her down again from the kitchen. 
The food isn't horrible but the service is. 
If you've got about 3-4 hours to waste, then sure, try this place out...."}
{"text":"It was very quiet and it was completely empty from passing dirty tables still not cleaned up to the waitress just sitting down not taking our order with 10 minutes passed not even asking us what we wanted to drink we just got up and walked out."}
{"text":"I was stationed in Korea with the military, so I have been exposed to my fair share of delicious authentic dishes.  Koryo is really good.  Our server was very sweet and always on top of bringing us drink refills.  Great kimchi, spicy crab soup, and mixed vegetable bibim bab!  I'll definitely be returning with friends."}
{"text":"Came in and no one was there. Grabbed a few menus ourselves and waited for ~5 minutes before we got up and decided to leave. No hostess, no waiter/waitress, no anyone."}
{"text":"I was with a friend and had him try this place for the first time.  I ordered a chicken bbq and another one to go.  The chicken was horrible.  Looked like all the dark meat and scraps of the chicken.    I couldn't find her to stop her from making my togo order but she never came back to check on us and disappeared I couldn't tell her.  She argued with me when she showed up that they already made my meal to the point of a shouting match.   Just shocked because I am a waiter in a fine dining restaurant and was trained to be always professional and I would be fired if I was  arguing and lecturing a customer.  Try Takamatsu just a few blocks down on Dunlap.  Way better food and nicer servers.  I will never step foot in that questionable \"restaurant\" ever again."}
{"text":"DEAL IS INVALID! Before we ordered (As stated by the sign on the door), we informed the waitress of the $15 off for $25.  She told us that we could not redeem the coupon unless we order $50 or more.  She said that they changed their policy since they were losing money.  They also told us that the 10% discount did not apply unless we spent $50.  Not only were we bait and switched, the waitress didn't provide any service after dropping off our food at the table.  The owner came by and also explained that the Yelp deals were hurting his business, and apologized.  I give this restaurant a 2 star rating cuz the food is average, but the owner was super nice. Won't be back here again."}
{"text":"This has been our favorite Korean bbq restaurant for a while now and it has been good experiences. I don't know what it is, but the quality of their food and service has been declining. I think there has been a change in management or ownership. The biggest disappointment was when I was ready to pay my bill and found out that the Yelp deals '$15 for $25 deal' and '10% off your order over $25' are invalid! I told the owner that this is false advertisement but she blamed it on Yelp and they don't have control over it. It's either that the owner does not know what she is doing, or it's all bs. I spoke to the owner to make her aware of these issues and hopefully she took it to heart, because I truly want them to get back to being a really good restaurant. For the mean time, I'll most likely be eating at the other Korean restaurants until they solve these issues."}
{"text":"Hubster and I were in the mood for Korean again and decided to try this restaurant. We have been to almost all of the Korean restaurants in the Valley and by far, this particular place is the nicest in decor and aesthitics. Our friends joined us and we all ordered the Bulgogi Bimbimbap. Certainly tasty,very filling and seemed like the bowl was neverending. Service was attentive and accomadating. Side dishes were plentiful and I really dig the kimchi here. Hope this place stays around for a long time as we will be coming more often!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday with nobody in the restaurant. Had to wait five minutes for a server and then ten minutes for nobody to wait on us. I've been craving some bulgogi for a few months and was last down. 

Pete's Fish and Chips it is"}
{"text":"Worst place ever! Too bad Yelp doesn't let you leave negative stars. 

Ok, story time. We checked out this place over 4th of July on our way back to LA. We came in and this lady asked us how many people, we told her 8. Took her about 20 mins to get us seated. 20 mins! The place was empty! She seated us in this room that had the thickest funky meat smell. Felt like they didn't turn on the vent in years. 

After about 10 minutes, we decided to order 5 entrees since we wanted something light. She told us we couldn't do that since we HAD to order 8 meals for 8 people. What the actual fck? She also added that since she seated us in the \"VIP\" room we had to eat BBQ. My mom wanted to appease her so I told her we would order some more later but she wouldn't agree. She DEMANDED that we order 8 meals right there or she would change our table. 

After 2 minutes of going back and forth, she forced us to change table because apparently the \"VIP\" room was no longer available. My eyes rolled so hard I was on my way to wheel of fortune. Let me remind you that place was still empty. We were the only party. At this point, we wanted to leave but she insisted that we move. She showed us to a non-BBQ booth that was like for 4 people. Literally, it was one of those small booths for a family of four. She somehow expected that we share that booth because apparently 5 meals = \"5 people + we won't sever the other three\". We were so done with her attitude--we told her politely to cancel our orders and that we were leaving. She got angry and told us we couldn't leave. We left anyway. We paid $20 for 8 cups of water because she got aggressive. It wasn't worth the hassle nor time. 

Avoid this place at all cost. Horrible customer service. Unprofessional and rude. If you want Korean, check elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went in their tonight and ordered the bulgogi and chicken bulgogi and it was a bit dry but o.k. I also ordered the tofu soup which lacked so much flavor. It tasted like water and tofu. The waiter was friendly but just brought drinks and food and had to fetch her for the check. Keep in mind that there were only two couples... not really busy on a saturday night. The ban chan wasnt fresh and usually I ask for more but the waiter never bothered to stop at the table to ask if our food was ok or to give us refills. Paid 48.37 which was pricey for the meal and service i got. Wont be coming back!"}
{"text":"So very happy to have finally found a good KBBQ place in Phoenix! Food was great, side dishes were awesome. Service was even better. Left feeling full and satisfied, and cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Place was awful. Service was terrible. If you're not of ethnicity don't bother even trying"}
{"text":"This was the worst service we have ever received. We had to chase our waitress down twice and one time she was sitting on the phone not taking care of any of her tables. Our drinks were never filled (even alcoholic drinks which would have made them more money), we were scolded when we didn't know which meat was which when she brought it out. For a party of 7 to come to a restaurant for the first time and celebrate a special occasion, we expected to be treated well and yet we were ignored. All 7 of us will never come back to this horrible place. Her name was Judy so if you get her as your waitress just ask for someone else."}
{"text":"We felt like having some good Korean food and having the grill at your table cough our eyes. It was so good and the sides were so delicious. We enjoyed ourselves"}
{"text":"I've lived in S. Korea and I know what I'm talking about when I say their bibimbap and kimchi are legit! The servers are friendly but you should know that American style waitressing is different from Korean style. Not bad, just different. I like it better actually. Kinda just serve your meal and leave you alone, not to be rude, it's just a different culture. You can wave at them for a refill. The place was clean and the food was delicious, if you get the bibimbap, it comes with plenty of yummy banchan, so trust me, there is no need to order appetizers. You will get stuffed! Good place for a casual date night. The location is tucked away in a small strip mall. Turn in where you see the roller rink sign. If you are looking straight at Target, the street on the left hand side is where you need to go."}
{"text":"The food was good but pricey for the portions given. I also HAD to cook my own food and I really didn't want to lol. The waitress was very nice and friendly as we explained we had never really ate at a Korean grill type of place."}
{"text":"Eh. It was ok. I've had lots of other Korean BBQ places. This one is... ok. The grill on the table couldn't get hot enough and the bulgogi marinade was...ok. 
Service was very good. 
I also didn't like that the ventilation wasn't good at all. It got quite smokey in the restaurant with only 3 tables bbq-Ing."}
{"text":"Koryo replaced another Korean eatery not too long ago. I was sad to see the original restaurant close; however, Koryo is quite fantastic!

The restaurant is beautiful and comfortable to be in. The staff is polite, speedy and effeciant! Most importantly, the food is delicious! If you are looking for a good Korean place, this is the perfect place. The food is fairly authentic, and there are plenty of options, even for picky eaters. For the quality of the food, the price is fair, but eating at Koryo can get expensive quickly (especially for sushi). 

Koryo is a fantastic restaurant! Stop by if you're looking for Korean!"}
{"text":"Am I giving some Korean BBQ in a mall food court 4 stars? YA DARN RIGHT I AM! The food court at the Toronto Eaton Centre really is an impressive place. Unlike most American food courts which primarily offer the same generic options over and over, Canadian Malls (Not all, but many in the GTA) give you a darn good selection of authentic style foods that can even go toe to toe with some sit down establishments. I came here on Monday morning/afternoon (whatever you want to consider 10:30AM) looking for a quick bite before driving back to Buffalo. Now, I absolutely love Korean food, it's probably my favourite type of food from Asia (I also love Chinese, Thai, Indian, Afghani, Turkish, and pretty much every other) and this place did not disappoint me. I ended up ordering the  beef combo with kimchi fried rice, honey glazed potatoes, and glass noodles with a side of water (I love life on the edge, ya know). The beef was absolutely delicious, much better then I would of expected out of a small place in the mall (Though I shouldn't be surprised since I've had similar experiences at other places in the same food court). The honey potatoes were also delicious, and tasted very unique at the same time. The Glass noodles were pretty typical for what they were and the same can be said for the kimchi rice, which was very good. 

Overall, the service was fast and friendly, the food was delicious (and took me two meals to eat), and the location can't be beat. I highly recommend anyone in the downtown GTA give this place a shot, you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I found this new restaurant while searching for something new and different on Yelp. My husband and I arrived around 6pm and we were the only ones, but others filtered in later. The service was great and very friendly. The restaurant has an authentic Korean feel and they have a decent beer/wine selection at very reasonable prices. My husband ordered the bibim bhab with short ribs that was warm and tasty. I had the Mae Oon Tang soup with fish and tofu that was the perfect level of spicy. I especially love the little sides that come with the meal to complement the hot, spicy dishes. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Would have given it 5 stars because it has been really good so far, but this last time we went, it wasn't a good experience and we will not be returning.

They got a new waitress and she is not good at all. On top of that the food wasn't great.

We ordered meats to cook on the grill, the waitress just starts throwing meat on the grill in the order I didn't want it in. One of the meats we ordered, Joo Mool Luck, was extremely salty and garlicky. We told the waitress about this and she tried a piece of meat and said that this is what it should taste like. Hmmm...NO. I've had Joo Mool Luck here at least 5 times in the past and it wasn't salty like this. I understand it is a marinated meat but this was way over salted and we couldn't eat it. We also ordered Jampong. The Jampong was made with Udon noodles this time. I've never had Jampong with Udon noodles before at any Korean restaurant and never at this restaurant either and I always order it here. I asked the waitress why they used Udon noodles and she said that she is the chef and that is her specialty and then just walked away. It is unfortunate as this place has been good everytime I've been here until now."}
{"text":"One positive think about this place is that they give generous side dishes and free fills for thoses dishes. They do not allow self cook for party of one. I ordered thin slice beef brisket. It was way overcooked. Here is how they can become a 4 star.

1. Let people cook their meet even party of 1. The place is never full.
2. Have a good sweet vinager sauce.
3. Have salad as one of the side dish"}
{"text":"A lot of reviewers are complaining about the service, but there I have zero complaints. The food is good, especially the BBQ! Really good quality meat, although a little pricey, but definitely worth it. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for some good korean BBQ."}
{"text":"Nice lady that is the primary/only server.  It's not the best Korean BBQ I've had but it is still the real thing.  Lots of menu options.  The location sucks and is a little sketchy, but I've taken my wife and kids back more than twice.  Go for it if you've never had Korean food."}
{"text":"The worst Korean restaurant I've ever visited and to give you perspective, my wife and her family are Korean so I dine Korean a lot.  This place isn't just severely over priced but the wait staff is rude and delayed.  If you're looking for a fine, authentic, Korean cuisine turn around and find another place!!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend, and got two entrees- Bulgogi and Dduk gook. Rang about 30 bucks, we had a $15 dollar gift certificate.  Served on a sizzling plate and in big*ss bowl, extra rice was $1.50. Ample amount of meat, the rice cakes in the soup were a good consistency of chewy and soft; wish the broth had more flavor. We were the only ones in the restaurant and it was past lunch time, right before dinner. Hard to get the attention of the server, probably better service when there's more people eating."}
{"text":"They're totally lier! The food is a disaster! We ordered Jajangmyeon and bibimbpa, just soooo terrible! Also, when I bought the coupon there're no any rules showed that the coupon can only be redeemed when you purchase more than 50 dollars, but After I finish the meal, they told me that I cannot use coupon because I've purchase less than 50 dollars! Any people who've seen this common, please never come here again! This is the most terrible restaurant I've ever tried!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Korean restaurant, this is it. The food is incredible. Although this restaurant was not packed, it is sooo, worth experiencing the quaint, home- style atmosphere. News on current South Korean events and KPOP artists are shown on the televisions, the server also shows you how to use the inset grills on your table. The pricing was reasonable and worth it for the culture knowledge you gain in their food. Give this BBQ a try, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for Korean this is a great place to go. The wife and I went and it rocked. We got the beef and shrimp that you cook yourself at the table. Not like a hibachi place there is a little gas grill built right into the table. We also got the garlic edamame for an appetizer. Everything is very good. Just like Korea you get a mountain of side with your dinner. The cabbage salad was my favorite but they were all pretty tasty. I recommend this place whenever you are looking for some great Korean."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to get Korean BBQ. Like most other KBBQ, it is a little pricey. I would say that this place is a little cheaper than some other places I've gotten KBBQ though. 

Date and I ordered the bulgogi and the pork butt. Both were really good and had generous portions. The sides that are served with the food are also unlimited I believe.

The service was good and we both felt very welcomed - this place is a hidden jewel and I would recommend it to anyone that likes KBBQ! I think this place would see a lot more business in a better location."}
{"text":"Great Service and good BBQ, I've been here many times and happy face!"}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ pork along with all the complementary sides. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of fast food, but if you're looking for a decent vegetarian meal before checking out a movie at the AMC, then check this place out.

I always order the \"Vegetarian\" meal, which isn't technically a \"meal\" because it's just 2 scoops of rice and your choice of 3 sides. But their sides are amazing! The first thing you need to try are the Garlic Potatoes (I'll post a picture of them), they're so freakin good. Then give the Glass noodles a try, they certainly aren't the best glass noodles in the city, but if you've never tried Korean then you just have to get them. Then I suppose if you're being a proper vegetarian you might want to get something green on your plate, and you can't go wrong with a simple veggie mix. They also have Tofu and a bunch of other stuff I haven't bothered to try because I've already found the best stuff. But please prove me wrong.

All this for $6.50 and ready in 5mins! At the very least, it's a hell of a lot better then a salad on a bun at Subway."}
{"text":"Good food, very different and fun menu."}
{"text":"Came here for my first time for friday night dinner and waited for 10mins. for a host. Didn't get service even though the place was empty. We left. Get it together, it's a Friday."}
{"text":"We came to this restaurant after a TKD tournament ....Great food, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love KBBQ! I recently took some KBBQ virgins with me to Koryo and I must say I was impressed! The sides were delicious and they had my favorites so I can't complain about that. We did the usual meat staples: bulgogi, brisket, and marinated pork (that was NOT bulgogi) and all were tasty. I even talked my friends into trying tongue just to be adventurous. Everyone was thoroughly satisfied with our meal. The guys didn't bother eating any of the lettuce so I was quite happy to make all the lettuce wraps I wanted. Since it was the Lunar New Year, we also got a free egg dish as well! Yay! No AYCE option but maybe that's a good thing, prevents me from overeating :D

What really bumped this review to 5 stars for me was the customer service. I had put my ring into my pocket while eating and it must've fallen out during that time. After realizing I left it there, I called the restaurant immediately and asked if someone had seen it. Not only had they picked it up for me, they went through some extra precautionary measures to ensure that the ring actually belonged to me before giving it back! Some may say that it was unnecessary, but I am relieved that they didn't just hand it over to someone else. 

Thank you Koryo. I shall be back."}
{"text":"I went there last night for the first time and I must say that I was very surprised to see that  it wasn't way busier. I lived in South Korea twice and have eaten at countless old restaurants while I was there, and this place reminded me of those places. The layout wasn't as authentic as I expected, but they still had the grill at the table and the food was spot on. I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Showed up place said opened but it looked close. Stood for 15 minutes no server or host so we sat ourselves someone showed up 15 minutes later walked by us didn't even acknowledged us that's when we walked out. There was another family eating there as well. Place was dead horrible customer service disappointed as this place was recommended by a friend."}
{"text":"I was skeptical to try this place, due to the frequent owner changes.  We ordered the do it yourself bbq for lunch, and I have to say it is the best this building has had to offer.. I recommend the pork belly, bulgogi(beef) and the galbi(need short ribs). The ban chan (side dishes) were fresh and delightful. Would go again"}
{"text":"This place is Gangnam,  I love self serve BBQ right in the middle of the table.  

 Its not easy to find in the corner of a strip mall behind the  Target Center at Peoria and 43 Ave. in Glendale.  I like the table vents to help with the smoke but what can you do at a BBQ place. The place a has a nice quiet atmosphere, i hope to see the place grow as Glendale customers slowly tickle in. 

I'm a fan of quality food and excellent cooking and Kroyo has my attention.  I like to compare Kalbi beef between places and this place nails it, the dishes are tender and flavorful.  Another treat to having Korean Food is the endless amount of little side dishes.

Hope to see more reviews here the place is defiantly is worth the find.

{"text":"I was craving that tasty BBQ sandwich again this week and decided to head down here and grab one. The Thursday special is the BBQ Beef Flamer with fries for just $5.99 and I was in the mood for something cheap and tasty.

Since it's reading week and Ryerson isn't very populated, the food court was quiet the day I went in. There was no line and I was served right away. I asked for garlic potatoes on the side instead of fries and was charged $0.50 for it, which was fine, but the woman doing the cash didn't bother asking if that was okay (I don't care but I'm sure some people might). I didn't have to wait long at all to get my food but when i saw her doling out the garlic potatoes into my takeout container, I knew they were most likely going to be cold. Again.

Lo and behold, I got back to my office and they were absolutely 100% cold. As if they'd never been heated in the first place since they were cooked. That was super disappointing because all I wanted to do was disappear into my office and mow down on the delicious BBQ flamer and I had to stop in the kitchen just to microwave the potatoes. And everyone knows microwaved potatoes suck.

I knocked these guys down two stars becuase the service just sucks, the staff here doesn't really care and they're standoffish and borderline rude. The sandwich was great, but the portioning on the sandwich seems to be a tad small, even for the sale price, and the potatoes weren't even warmed. That's not a fluke twice in a row, that's just plain lazyness. Disappointed but may go back again sometime if I'm craving that sandwich again."}
{"text":"Wanted to go try this with my husband because we were hoping to find a Korean bbq near our house. Instead we ended up leaving before ordering.
Disappointed to find out that we couldn't barbecue at our table unless we ordered 3 plates."}
{"text":"Okay place if you can find it. Good roadside signage but I am sure poor layout of the strip mall that is why they have no lunch business.  I found Koryo on Yelp and we were looking for the physical restaurant and still had a hard time locating the entrance.  Nice wood interior but needs a good cleaning; floors, light shades, etc.  The large floor fan helping to circulate the air conditioning was causing the overhead lamps to sway and knock dust onto our table.  That was concerning so I got up and moved it a little.  The dining room was empty for lunch time. It was hot in there too. Big downside to having your front door facing the sun in the summertime. 

The staff/owner was really nice and attentive. Taking care to ask if we were familiar with Korean food.  I don't blame him as someone new might send stuff back for being too spicy.  They offered great lunch specials and had a nice menu selection. 

For the restaurant being empty, the food did take a bit to get out to the table. The spicy rice cake is always choice and we asked for mild heat. The sauce was on point and good portion, but had no meat or green onion. 

I did not care for the quality of meat they used in the Galbi bento box.  It was mostly fat and not cooked properly.  My mom didn't care for the chicken katsu, as the sauce looked burnt and was almost too dry to eat. The bento boxes were well dressed with an assortment of items: rice, salad, etc. 

Ban chan was fresh and good. I wish I could give this place more stars but there were just too many things that add up wrong that all the friendly and attentiveness can't overcome. I really do hope they improve.  I will return and try the Bibim bop instead and hopefully have a higher rating to update."}
{"text":"The food here is actually delicious. I usually don't like to eat in food courts because the food is often lower quality for the price you pay. But this place has big portions & tasted good. I got combo # 1 beef with 2 veggie sides. I chose the beans & garlic glazed potatoes with glass noodles instead of rice. The beef was cooked fresh right in front of us. I'd actually eat here again & I don't like eating in food courts."}
{"text":"Had the Goyza and the short rib hot pot. Goyza were good. Little deep fried dumplings with beef in them. Came with dipping sauce. Perfect app for two people if you are also having dinner. The hot pot was real good. I had the short ribs on top of veggies and rice. It also comes with sides of Korean veggies that you can eat by themselves or throw into the pot. They also put a fried egg on top of the meat and veggies in the pot. I wish it had a nice savory sauce on the bottom as the rice gets a tad dry from being scorched by the hot pot. They give you a side of chile sauce to squirt onto the pit but still wish it had some \"juice\" on the bottom. Plain but clean restaurant in a strip mall. The waitress was nice but works at her own pace. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant experience.
We were traveling with a large group.
We walked into a pretty empty place and the lady asks how many people we have. We state 17. She reprimands us for not making a reservation for a group of 15 or more. My mother responds by asking if we should go somewhere else instead. The lady reprimands us again by saying there is nowhere else that can serve that many people. After we place our orders, the lady reprimands us again for us not ordering the same thing and ordering different items on the menu. One particular item we ordered was the Korean Bone Soup. That took about 30-40 minutes to arrive and when it did, the meat was not even cooked. It was still frozen. After my father saw the frozen meat, he just about lost it. We had a very unpleasant time and felt unwelcomed from the beginning. I do not recommend going. If you have had a great streak of pleasant restaurant experiences and want to break that streak, go here."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place for the longest time, i love korean food. So we decided to go for date night. my boyfriend and I walked in and was greeted by two happily elderly ladies. 

As my boyfriend was looking through the menu, he was so skeptical of what to get because this was new to him. Well, he didn't like his food of choice. We wanted to see the menu again, but she gave us nasty face as in, your going to oay for that meal right? The lady was very rude and wasn't apologetic at all. Didn't accommodate us or anything. 

Only two people worked there.  It was pulling teeth to get them to refill our drinks. It was just horrible.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  :("}
{"text":"Full fledged menu of offerings you would expect...and then some.  
Quaint decor, and great table grills. 
It's a nice mixture of modern and ancient Korean. 
The place was very quiet, and slow.  
I'll be back to try several dishes I made note of including the ice cream deserts."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Ordered #1 Korean BBQ beef with rice + honey glazed potatos and chapchae.  Generous portion.  Love their potato and chapchae, both very favorable. Potatos were crispy and the sauce was yummy.  The beef was ok."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! We went at lunch and used my Yelp deal.  The staff (owners?) were so welcoming and friendly throughout the meal.  We chose to grill our meats ourselves and ordered a variety - galbi, marinated pork, bi bim bap and seafood pancake.  We also ordered the wings which had a sweet and sticky sauce (very good!) but if you were expecting a certain popularized crispy style of Korean fried chicken, this is different from that, but still tasty.  The kimchi and side dishes were good quality and all vegetables were very fresh! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed!  We ordered the galbi, bulgogi, and kimchee chigae.  They were all awful!  The meat was flavorless and the kimchee stew had jalapenos in it!?!?  It was way over priced for nothing.  I would not recommend or ever go back."}
{"text":"Food and service were good.  Try the bulgogi, it's delicious!  I will definitely go back again next time I'm on the west side of town."}
{"text":"I saw that there was a Yelp deal for Koryo, and decided to try it for my bf's first kbbq experience. As soon as we sat down, however, I learned that it isn't AYCE; instead you have to have at least 2 meet/seafood options on the table at all times and they vary in prices. We ordered the Galbi, Bulgogi, and brisket all served with a nice variety of banchan and dipping sauces. SO MUCH FOOD. The meat was so tender and marinated so well! I don't eat typically eat beef, let alone enjoy it, but the Galbi was hella flavorful and delicious! The servers kept the banchan filled whenever they noticed a bowl empty and even gave us lettuce upon request. 

The restaurant is really large with a main dining room and a larger one in the back that can be separated for larger parties. They have tables for grilling as well as booths for ordering pre-cooked food. Great experience."}
{"text":"A hidden Korean BBQ gem in Phoenix. 

I have been here a few times, and every time, the barbecue is delicious and consistently fantastic every time. Their other dishes, such as their fried rice, udon, and bibimbap are also top notch. They do leave you alone when you eat, which is nice."}
{"text":"First time here and will definitely NOT be our last! Great/friendly customer service, fresh food cooked right before your eyes and a  fantastic kid friendly atmosphere. You will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was craving Korean food, and there aren't many options out here in the West Valley, so I thought I'd give this a shot. Food was alright - not the worst Korean I've had but certainly not the best either. We ordered three lunch specials (2 kalbi, 1 salmon teriyaki).

Seafood pancake - Not bad, except that the inside was a little too doughy and chewy. 

Kalbi - Average, it didn't have that little bit of char that I like on my BBQ. 

Salmon teriyaki - Decent, although a bit under-sauced.

Side dishes were pretty good and no real complaints here.

All in all, it's not a bad place and I would go here again only because of the lack of Korean options in the area. Lunch specials were a good value at $10.95 for the kalbi special, which included vegetable tempura, rice, and salad. Salmon teriyaki was about the same price as well, although I don't quite remember the exact price. 

Service left a bit to be desired. We were one of only 2 tables but the 2 people working there weren't very attentive. Secondly, we were given the regular menu at first even though it was still lunch hour. I had to specifically ask for the lunch special menu. I believe they wanted us to pay for non-lunch prices."}
