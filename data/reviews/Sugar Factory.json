{"text":"IMPORTANT NOTE: Mondays are no longer all-day happy hour. There's a photo in the yelp gallery showing that it is, but we were informed today, March 24 of 2014, that they're not doing that anymore. Now their happy hours are from 3 to 6, Monday through Friday.  We went in around 2 to split a happy hour burger and try one of their shakes. Our server checked with management and gave us happy hour pricing on the burger just this once, which was kind of them. Service was nice, ambiance pleasant, and things came out in a timely manner. Their water was some of the cleanest we've had in a restaurant. The strawberry shake is probably the finest I've ever had ? but it had better be, for $8, you know? The burger came out well done even though I ordered medium, and it seems to be one of those pre-formed, pre-grilled burgers with a bunch of liquid smoke added to it. Aside from the patty, everything else about the meal was good ? but because of the patty, I'll never order that again, and I'd have been disappointed to pay $14 for it.  It's weird to give the place 4 stars mostly just for the great shake, super-clean water, and nice service, but here we are."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I don't try new places but I found a gem in The Sugar Factory.  Chef Chris and Chef Alejandro really did a great job on my food.  I'm highly critical of food expecially pasta because it's so easy to make.  These guys outdid themselves.  I'll be back soon for food and of course drinks.  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I'm reading all the reviews about this place before I write mine and wow I can relate to a lot of these reviews. First off when I arrived at this location in Town Square I noticed that the AC didn't work. Drinking alcohol in a warm musty room doesn't help. Sweat just came pouring so embarrassing with friends around.   Second, there wasn't any cell phone connection. Couldn't access my phone.  Third, the price for the food is outrageous. Make sure you go there during happy hour because it's 50% off on limited items.   Overall it wasn't worth the $400 my bro in law paid, it was a sub par experience. Bring a sweat rag with you coz your gonna need it!"}
{"text":"I really can't put into words what an amazing experience we had here. I believe there were 36 of us who attended dinner here for my bachelorette party, and we were blown away by the food, drinks and most of all the service.    First of all to have that many people order food and to all have their meals within 5-10 minutes of the first meal being brought out is super impressive and shows how well the staff work together. The manager (I believe his name was Shawn introduced himself and made sure anything we wanted was takes care of. Our servers name was Eric and what a fantastic guy!! Such patience for dealing with such a large group and so so sweet and professional.     They truly made it an unforgettable experience. I'm going back again tomorrow and would highly recommend a visit to anyone!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered burgers and shakes, pretty simple...burgers came out wrong, shakes did not arrive til we were all done with our meals. Asked for the shakes to go since they came out so late and then it took our server so long to get the to go cups we just ended up making them to go ourselves. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Went there tonight about 6:00 and the lights were off and the door was chained. The signs were leaning up against the patio. Normally love this place for the desserts, but had to look elsewhere tonight."}
{"text":"Service was good, we were there on Saturday and about half the restaurant was full.  The only reason we went was because my 13 and 15 yr old wanted to check it out.  There signature drinks did not have a price on the menu so we asked the waitress how much for the non-alcoholic Drake drink, she said $34, my kids decided it pretty steep and opted to pass on it, but my husband and I insisted they try it.  When the drink arrived they took a couple of sips and said it was not worth the price which made me and my husband proud, it was a great lesson in life, $34 may of been too steep for this novelty drink/restaurant but the experience was priceless. Just another overpriced and over endorsed place on the Strip."}
{"text":"The service was fine. The kitchen cooks are a mess. This place is highly expensive and the food came out cold. Too many menu selections to choose from. The cold sandwich was the only thing that came out right.   As for the chocolate fondu with cheese cake, brownies and strawberries were amazing. Stick to the sweets.  A $30.00 sucker...really?"}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here and Sugar Factory by far surpassed my expectations. This new location is way better then when they were located near the Paris hotel.   The management staff was present and on top of things, the service was as incredible as the awesome milkshakes. I use to think that the Sugar Factory only had good desserts. Now, I know the food is just as good too!!   Thanks SF staff for making my birthday memorable!!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Back in Minnesota there is no place similar to this at all. I opted for the Ocean Blue in the goblet and it's legit. I'm telling you guys, they do not cheap you out on the alcohol. Overall, it is pricey, but I will try to make my return and try some new drinks!  :)"}
{"text":"Matt, Mario and the crew at Sugar Factory at Town Square are AWESOME! The service was amazing and they made it a point to come by our table multiple times to make sure we had everything that we needed. Definitely a top notch, clean, well-decorated restaurant. The overall ambiance has a young and fun vibe, and the staff is personable and attentive.   With it being over 110 outside, the drinks at Sugar Factory were as refreshing as they looked. I highly recommend the peace, love and harmonie drink. Food was delicious and overall it was a fabulous experience for the bachelorette party I was with. If you are looking to go to Sugar Factory, I highly recommend making the trip out to this one at Town Square, as it is less touristy then the one on the strip and it doesn't take long to get there.   I will definitely be visiting again when I am back in Las Vegas in September!"}
{"text":"Very yummy burger! Juicy! Tasty! Filling! Great shake but I couldn't finish it all. Cute decor and friendly waiter. I would visit again! Definitely will not visit their candy shop though ($22 for a lollipop lol)!"}
{"text":"Overall, my wife and I had a pleasant experience here for lunch.  I felt like one could get diabetes just from looking at the menu, but, to be fair, this is Sin City.  I had the jalapeño burger and my wife had the mac and cheese burger.  Both were incredibly tasty.  We also got a Nutella crepe for dessert which was excellent.  They didn't skimp of the Nutella.  Overall, I would recommend this place.  I'm taking one star off because the food and drinks were overpriced ($16 for a pina colada??) even for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for our first time it looks like something fun to go to. I asked  the waitress what she recommended because I heard that their pancakes are really good and she said they were order their original pancakes I was sadly disappointed they were flat and hard I had to use a knife to cut them and they tasted very bland.i wont be back!"}
{"text":"Sugar factory reached out and wanted to make things right.  They went above and beyond to make things right.  But waitress instead of finding out said that or dessert was right.  We had ordered the fried ice cream with fried oreos, while delicious the ice cream was not fried. Food was OK,  nothing amazing but definitely improved from the first visit."}
{"text":"Some very cool drinks. Food was tasty too. You can watch the Bellagio fountains while you're eating, great location! Our waiter Tom was very kind and made good suggestions cocktail, thanks Tom K :) price is fair."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in town. Fun and delicious drinks with great food. Get a huge goblet of signature cocktail full of candy, and dry ice. Try the Mac n cheese pops or a burger on a brioche bun. Ask for Ricci to be your server, very attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"The food was not satisfactory at all! Cold, over priced, and tasted like it was cheap freezer food. Do not eat here.  Service was good."}
{"text":"First experience here at sugar factory was great.  I don't often write reviews but our sever Lauren was great.  She kept checking up on us to make sure our orders were brought to us on time and made sure our orders were brought on time.  We didn't to wait long.  That's what you call good customer service!"}
{"text":"Our server was so nice and asked me to write a review. We should be careful what we ask for. I was with two other people and we all ordered different entrees and 1 appetizer. It was ALL bland and left much to be desired. The goblet drinks were....well..large and ok, but not even worth the discount with the Yelp check-in. I definitely will skip this place in the future and you should too."}
{"text":"We went for a bday dinner the waiter started off fantastic until they brought our food and one plate had a hair in it! We tried to flag our waiter down for 5 min finally came took plate back never came and checked up on us the food took forever when we initially ordered it took 15 min when plate got sent back it took 33 min I timed it! It was too late at this point we had been there for over and hour and past the hunger stage! Tried to flag him down yet again to get the check he saw we didn't even eat the food at the point literally ruined the bday which we told him it was a birthday celebration didn't do anything sing! That plate wasn't removed from our bill total was 218 cause all 3 of us ordered goblets and I still even tipped because I believe in karma! Horrible experience wish he would have at least talked to manager about the hair in our food and removed that plate or something but guess not!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Our server had a very large party but made sure we got the treatment we expected and more."}
{"text":"Dinner in general was good. The reason of my low rating is due to the following: Fishbowl drinks do not have a price on the menu. Was shocked to see that 3  of these came up to be $118. Menu says 60 oz however the fishbowl where they serve it is full of ice. The steak that I ordered was very small and thin; cost for that was $29.  I have never been to a restaurant where they have   a fee for candle when they sing happy birthday to someone. I saw that on the bill for $5."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. The grilled cheese was awful, the soup cold and the fries were flimsy. The food was overpriced and the quality hugely lacking."}
{"text":"Service is great,  clean and fun atmosphere, without having to deal with the crowds at the strip.  Lots of Michael Jackson music, if you're into that.  :) the banana split crepe is delicious.  The turkey Club was great too, the fries were a bit mushy for my taste, but I like extra thin and crispy."}
{"text":"Ummm definitely share a goblet if you can. Lots to share. The garbage salad was good even though they forgot the avocado which we had to wait for. The fries for 5$ could have had more. But good service! The Mai tai was more Malibu like so it wasn't too bad. The passion goblet was pretty strong."}
{"text":"Went in for a early breakfast t opening,  we were seated right away. I  ordered a bacon & swiss omlette. It was a standard well cooked omlette, could have used a little salt/peper. But over all a good well serviced meal. I would go back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Great happy hour....and great food   Outdoor seating with misters on patio and great service"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon and didn't realize you couldn't use it on the strips location of this place, and when I arrived to the Sugar Factory on the strip they were complete B**ches about it and told me I don't know how to read directions because it obviously says they don't take these and it's the other location that does. So after spending $30 on a taxi ride over to THIS location, lets just say we weren't so happy with our experience with this company so far. When we arrived to this location the hostess seated us right away, our waiter came over and was friendly. We told him about the Groupon and he said no problem....ONLY problem is he DIDNT check I.D. for drinks and NEVER redeemed our Groupon....  Food came out after 20mins of ordering, just for pasta and a burger, and than our milkshake took forever in a day to come.   If it wasn't or the fact that of the Groupon, we will NOT come back. Sadly..."}
{"text":"Town square location.   We were walking by when noticed a new sugar factory! I've been wanting a goblet for so long so of coarse half off drinks, appetizers, and pizzas we ate here!  (Lollipop passion & white gummy were very good)  Food was good, our server lorenzo was very nice and helpful with all our questions!   Good local spot, may be my birthday dinner location, who knowsss :)"}
{"text":"YES! Theres finally another sugar factory in town! I stopped by the opening of the sugar factory a couple weeks ago and I was blown away! From their delicious goblets to their grilled to perfection burgers I couldn't have asked for a better evening.Me and two others promptly seated even though it was busy and the customer service was exquisite! Right from the moment i walked in the door the vibe was set with the upbeat music and the eye-catching chandeliers! The whole place just has a sparkle to it! On top of the looks, our server was amazing. She was so happy to be working and it definately rubbed off on us. Anything we needed, she got us with haste and our food and drinks got to the table super fast! We needed an extra straw for our goblet and before we could ask her she whipped out an extra with a big grin on her face. I ordered a burger and not only did it look amazing, it was and I'm a big burger guy! This is a weird habit of mine but i always check the silverware to see of theres any water spots on them and these were some of the cleanest forks and knives I've ever used. I really meant it when i said the whole place sparkled lol! This place covers fine dining with a hip yet casual twist! I recommend it for anyone who stops by town square or is looking for an awesome five star experience!"}
{"text":"We (party of 7) were seated quickly enough but then it stop there! The service was horrible had to keep asking for service. The only reason they're getting 2 stars is because the food was very good once we got it. Never going back though...SMH"}
{"text":"The service was great! Anthony was our server and he was very attentive and accommodating and customize a dessert order. Service was fast. Got seated right away. The entree was typical American food, but the dessert was delicious. Would come back here for dessert."}
{"text":"Our first time at the sugar factory at townsquare, and it was very good. Our server Nissa was attentive. She recommended drinks suiting our best interests and also brought our friend birthday shots. The food was great and big pirtioned, also, the drinks are delicious. Nissa described the entire drink menu for us to ensure we ordered our favorite one. Seriously try this place out!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Sugar Factory and loved it! The host was pleasant and made recommendations and even came back after our meal was finished to ask us what we ordered.  Our server Monique was awesome! She gave us great service, not once did we feel rushed or forgotten about.  She was busy but made sure we were happy and had everything we needed. We will be back and be sure to ask for Monique"}
{"text":"So this is my first time here, we got seated, waited and waited to be served..about 20 min of waiting to be served my family and I just walked out.  It's not even close to full and service here is horrible.  No server came by to check up on us after we were seated.  As a local I'm never visiting again with this kind of service."}
{"text":"Went here last night with the hubs and promised to give a review- New to the Yelp scene! Waitress was very sweet but the drinks made our stomachs ache! Too sweet! Definitely recommend sharing a drink in order to not get sick!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time ever going to the Sugar Factory with my friend Tyler and it will certainly not be the last! Our waitress Terri was an absolute doll-baby and was attentive and helpful  The Lollipop Passion goblet that I had was outta this world yummy and they did it virgin  I will recommend this Sugar Factory location to EVERYBODY"}
{"text":"Overpriced and misleading. The \"gigantic banana and walnut pancake\" was a single regular sized pancake and the \"loaded with banana\" description meant 5 slices of banana. It was decent food, but not worth the price...."}
{"text":"This place is a gimmick and a joke. The food quality is similar to Burger King. The fondue was an embarrassment. Save your money and go to Dairy Queen. Service was terrible. I was told the Sugar Factory near the Paris was better."}
{"text":"Breakfast was inedible and expensive! Eggs dry and tasteless.  Shocking server!  Manager is pathetic. They don't care. Complete tourist rip off!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I never write reviews, you know the phrase if you don't have something nice to say...you get the idea.  I'm writing this review so nobody else has to endure the wretched experience at the sugar factory that I did.   I don't mind spending money on food, although their food is a bit overpriced it didn't bother me to spend the money. We went for a special occasion, ordered three meals. Not only where the meals missing every possible thing we asked for, but when we told the waiter, \"you know maybe we could at least get the bread for the meal\" Nevermind the missing pecans, burnt French toast , and the wrong protein on the fettuccini...  but maybe we could at least get the bread..nope too much to ask for, \"would you like to pay was the response.\" Ummm no I would like the correct meal, that would be nice. We paid..full price, which isn't the problem. The horrible meal, horrible service, and complete disregard for your customer is the problem.  I will be sure to tell my clients what a mess this place is when they are asking for recommendations, seeing as I work in the mall.   Do yourself a favor and go next door to Benihana ...they get client service!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, delicious food & yummy drinks!!  The fried Mac n cheese bites were huge!  My son had the popcorn shrimp & there was a ton of juicy shrimp!  The melon bowl was so fun!!"}
{"text":"I dined here 7/25/17 with my children while on vacation. Friendliest waitstaff around, you should be pleased. Was anticipating to try one of the goblet drinks but decided against at once I found out the sticker price.   I ordered the Classic Waffles and was extremely disappointed in how rubbery tasting they were. I sampled my daughters Big Cheesy burger and by far was the best cheesy burger I've ever tasted.   I feel the menu has too many options, which was bothersome as I was trying to hurry to order but skipped thru a lot of items. My children loved everything about it, however I found it a tad overpriced for such common food items....l"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times USMNT's been great, service is sufficient, food is tasty and my kids love the exaggerated milk shakes. They taste delicious and it's like a meal-in-one. The sliders and burgers are delicious, the white chocolate burger is just what it sounds like, sweet and tasty."}
{"text":"Where to start,   I made reservations (for 14) to celebrate my birthday here. Once we got there at our reservation time, they had no tables to sit us at. That's when the hostess asked if we wanted to sit upstairs in the chocolate lounge. Sure. Once upstairs and got settled in. We ordered our drinks. Then we ordered our food. Sitting for 30min we still have NOT received our drinks we ordered. Our drinks FINALLY came as well as only half of our tables food order. The rest of us sat for several more minutes until a couple more of our dishes came out. At this point we were waiting on 2 steak entrees for the last food to come out (steak bordelaise and steak bearnaise). It came totally wrong!!! My friend ordered hers med-well and my BF ordered his med-rare. Their steaks were mixed up on each others plates. And to top it off, they gave mushrooms (in a plastic container) instead of caramelized onions on what was supposed to be my BF Steak Bordaise. The server did not seem to care and blamed the kitchen staff on their mistake. We had to ASK for the carmelized onions!! Obviously, it's her job to make sure the food she's delivering is the right order. A friend ordered the alfredo and it came out like a kids meal size. Wth. We also did not receive an appetizer until after our dinner. The busser kept coming around trying to clear off plates that we were still working on, seeming like they were trying to hurry our meal and get us out. They also won't split checks for you.  I really wanted to come here to celebrate my birthday with friends and try their desserts but after the terrible service We just skipped dessert to get out of there.  So bummed this place could've been fun.   This place is 1)overpriced for the quality you're getting 2) terrible service, server will Just pass the blame to others and won't offer to Fix it nor apologize."}
{"text":"Request Rhea as your waitress!! She definitely made our trip to sugar factory one of the most memorable experiences we had here in Las Vegas! Not only was she extremely attentive from the moment we had sat down, she was funny, friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable with answers to any questions we had about their extensive menu (which is a lot to look through! But it was impressive how many different options they have food & drink wise, our party of 7, 4 of which were young children were all able to find exactly what we wanted to eat even though each meal was vastly different from the others). Also following her suggestions on desserts turned out to be the most beautifully hand-crafted \"insane\" milkshakes, (including one with an entire slice of cheesecake on the top, one with cotton candy and Skittles and one with a bacon cheeseburger to top it!) And they taste as delicious as they look!! I had the club sandwich and although it was HUGE in portion sjze, I couldn't stop myself from eating more and more. My husband got the steak and lobster tail which was cooked to perfection and although pricey, completely worth every cent! We ordered the white gummy worm goblet with alcohol and we're pleased to find out we could order any of them without the alcohol also for the kids. They enjoyed the lollipop and ocean blue goblets. The beer selection is a little slim but we were pleased even more when our waitress assured us it was a full bar not limited to the menus cocktails and martinis only, so my sister in law enjoyed a vodka soda. The bruchetta and spinach and artichoke dip were definitely a great meal starter. We enjoyed dinner in the chocolate lounge upstairs and loved the atmosphere. We will definitely be returning next time we are in town!!   Thank you sugar factory staff and thank you Rhea for making our experience much more than just dinner out as a family!"}
{"text":"Delicious drinks, great food and desserts. Could not ask for more!! If you are on the Las Vegas strip you have to come get ur favorite drink here.  The service is top notch.  The waitress is super nice and constantly checks in to make sure ur ok."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience here.  I can't rate the food (although it looked awesome) but the drinks were excellent.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was superb. They have a large array of novelty mixed drinks that not only looked cool but tasted awesome. They have regular sized novelty martinis and goblets drinks that looks like an 8th grade science experiment (gummy candies, dry ice, etc).   My own gripe, is that they played a very short playlist of songs. I think I heard, \"California Gurls\" like 3-4 times during my visit (the song was fitting, but a larger variety would have been welcomed)."}
{"text":"Never again. Went there earlier and had the worst service. Hostess didn't know if one of the servers was new. I asked the hostess for a pen to sign my check and was offered a.crayon. Server poured iced tea in my glass of water, saw she made a mistake then walked away then came back to bus a plate. I had to ask her to take the glass of tea water. Was asked if I wanted a to-go box for my water. Who does that. I swear I thought I was on an episode of plunked or what would you do. Wow. Never again Sugar Factory Town Square.Try screening your employes for some common sense. I'll go to the one near the Paris hotel."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant within the beautiful towns square area. Food was great I had the meatballs and garlic bread. Goblets are amazing me and my boyfriend had a lovely time here. We had purchased a groupon and had plenty of good. Also brought a goblet to bring home which was wrapped in a lovely bag. Our waitress was fantastic and all other staff appeared to be very professional and welcoming. Will defo come back here a truly lovely spot in Las Vegas. In fact I'm so glad this was available on groupon as I didn't even know town square existed !!"}
{"text":"Amazing mimosa brunch! Service was spectacular and the food was great! Max is the best server for this awesome experience!"}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT the SF at Paris. Here is how our night went:  1. Hostess seats us & tells us it's happy hour until close (1/2 off all drinks) 2. Takes at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us 3. By the time he showed up, we were ready to order drinks & food 4. Our appetizer showed up before our drinks (3 small pieces of bruschetta haphazardly thrown on a plate) 5. My drink finally shows up...my husband's is nowhere in sight.  6. We had to flag down a manager to hunt down our other drink.  7. The kid sitting at the table next to us put his retainer on a side plate & the bus boy threw it out. Chaos ensues. COULDN'T MAKE IT UP IF I TRIED.  8. Dinner was mediocre. The serving sizes are half what they are at Paris, but the prices are the same.  9. Bill comes (after we wait awkwardly for 15 minutes)...the server had all our drinks at full price & also decided to charge us for a slice of birthday cake & a sparkler that we never order. When we pointed out the non-happy hour drinks, his response was, \"Oh, did the hostess tell you it was happy hour? She's not supposed to do that.\" ???  By the time they got our bill corrected, it went from $153 to $60. They were trying to charge us more than double what it should've been! Pretty sure we won't be returning..."}
{"text":"I had brunch here with a few friends, it was good. I was greeted by the hostess and seated right away outside, it was a beautiful day to eat outside. The patio was covered so it was shady and cool. Our server was very nice and friendly and quick with our drinks. The food menu was full of sweets, all the pancakes, waffles and crepes were loaded with items on them. Not the place to go if you wanted something light, other then just eggs, but I guess it's just living up to its name. I settled for blueberry lemon pancakes. They were delicious, the blueberries were on top of the pancakes instead of baked inside them and it had lemon shavings on top as well. I also got a Bloody Mary, it was nothing to brag about and just ok. I figured since everything else is over the top it would be too but I was wrong. I've been here before for the cocktails and I must say they are amazing, pricey but tasty! I would go bak for the cocktails but not sure for the food. It wasn't bad just nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Terrible service, overpriced, and not worth your time. Went here for brunch with my friend and they messed up both of our orders (my friend didn't even get the meal she ordered and mine was messed up). The unlimited mimosas were tiny and they never came back to refill them, what a waste of money. Our waitress was very apologetic but it wasn't even busy and for the prices you are paying it's not worth your time dealing with the crappy service and food."}
{"text":"The bloody Mary's were fabulous!  They charge $2 a person for tap water and watch your bills at the bar because they charged more then the menu stated."}
{"text":"Kaylie the bartender here is freakin amazing and just a sweetheart!!!!!! Come see her at brunch time on the weekends!!!! And the GM Lana O'Neil knows how to welcome you to her restaurant :) Love this place!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If there was an option for 0 stars I would select it. Extremely disappointed with our experience. The service was horrible. They were not crowded so no excuses. The food is over priced. I honestly would've gotten better service at a local chain. Do not waste your money or your time. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that can provide friendly service and quality food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Anne Marie was amazing, she took such great care of my friends and me. The bowls are so good and the food definitely helps with the drinking - so delicious. This is a MUST VISIT when you go to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We went to sugar factory for brunch with our groupon! I recommended you getting it saves you soo much money. We had ricardo c. as our waiter he was so great and helpful! He is the real reason why I gave 5 stars. The breakfast was delightful and the Mai Thai goblet got me feeling good! Highly recommend. I think overall was a wonderful experience. Thank you Ricardo!!"}
{"text":"It makes me happy to update my feelings on the SF, the  staff did get they're groove thang going! I value good  customer service, it's just as important to me as the food being good when I go somewhere. The 2 go hand in hand to ensure a customer is always happy. I'm a happy girl!  my tummy is growling thinking about my next visit! I was always a goblet girl at the prior locations but the new extreme milk shakes give me life ugh!"}
{"text":"Terrible service horribly overpriced!  Took, my GF there for dinner and drinks. She order the hamburger which was delivered wrong, we informed the manager and he said sorry and walked off, her gummy bear drink had like 4 gummy worms in it. I never got a single refill for my lemonade... Place is a joke.... Save your money"}
{"text":"AMAZING!! The Sugar Factory cares so much about their customers and what they think. Came back again before I left Las Vegas and was so glad. I was dying to try a goblet, so I got the lollipop passion and it was really neat. Our server was really nice as is all of their staff. Really nice place to stop by and eat. It's also really fun and the experience was memorable. Hope to visit again"}
{"text":"It was mine and my friends first time together in Vegas and the bartender was so awesome. She was the nicest and accommodating bartender. Two thumbs way up :) Next time we will definitely do more thank just drink here."}
{"text":"OMG. We tried this restaurant for the first time and are in love.  We ordered the Chinese chicken salad, chicken, mushroom and spinach crepe and Mediterranean Chicken Pappardelle and they were amazing.  The crepe was our favorite but the others were delicious as well.  Best of all was our server, Lillian, who was bubbly, fun and proud of the restaurant and selections.  She made our experience extraordinary and we will be back to see her.  She is a major asset to the restaurant and  is the best server we've had in months at a variety of high end places.   Thanks for the great food and service.  :)"}
{"text":"This sugar factory sucks! Messed up my girlfriend and I's order and then messed it up again when they brought it out a second time. Don't come here stick to the sugar factory on the strip much better customer service."}
{"text":"As I sit here at the Grand Luxe cafe I write this. We sat at Sugar Factory for 15 min on the patio with zero acknowledgment from our server. He walked past more then a few times and we saw he kept forgetting parts of orders and ignoring others as well. We then asked to move inside thinking perhaps it would be better. Nope. The hostess knew we hadn't been served outside thus should have alerted waitstaff but again we were ignored. Waitstaff walked by no acknowledgement. Out the door we went. Hostess unfazed. Never again. Place was not full by any means either."}
{"text":"I am all about the Dill Pickle POPPED, but five bucks is a bit dramatic. Nahmean?"}
{"text":"Very poor servicethe waiters did not pay attention to what I needs and completely ignored, I never accepted such a poor service, I was a guest should have this service?I will tell my friends not to visit this restaurant"}
{"text":"Darla was great, we had a big party with split checks and was extremely patient and  Nice.   The burger was amazing, the goblets are soo good. I had the white gummy and they Mai tai."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time, heard this place was a go to. The atmosphere was clean, cute and fun! I ordered their famous goblet drinks, definitely cute and good but was surprised with it being almost $40. I think that although it was a must try, I'd probably will not be getting one again, at least not for that price. I didn't get to try the food here but I'm sure they are good to. Will definitely be back to give the food a try, worth checking out while you are in vegas!"}
{"text":"Nice decor but overrated .The goblets don't have a price on the menu, the reason why is they are $38 for some dry ice and alcohol. The food is mediocre, we ordered burgers which were ok but nothing to write home about. Asked for a duck for my son and was charged $3, thanks! Won't be back."}
{"text":"I wish i could give this more stars just because our server, Melissa, was super Nice. but she should prob brush up on her menu knowledge...the drinks and food were not impressive. The drink \"Lollipop\" shows 3 lollipops and candy necklaces in it, it came with one, false advertisement for a $30 cocktail. The description even says it come with lollipopS! The bruschetta was tasty but not a sharing portion. My chicken Marsala was a huge let down. Never try it here if you love chicken Marsala... My sister had the tomato soup with grilled cheese, that was probably the best part of the meal. Its a cute place but dont think I'd return and pay full prices again. Maybe next time i will come during happy hour.."}
{"text":"The waiters here have no idea what they were doing ! Asked for water for the whole table only got like 6 cups with no ice . At the end we asked for our bill they over charged us for 4 plates of food we didn't get ! I called the place to get a refund and the manager that was working on 9/30 in the night was rude as f**** I asked to get a refund for the plates of food we didn't get he went ahead and told me that \"well you ate that food and you have to pay for it \" and hung up on me ! I called again yesterday 10/1 and I tried talking to the manger and she told me that they were to busy and to take my info down I gave her my info and I asked her something and she hung up on me !! They still have not called me to resolve my problem ! ? This place needs more training and the managers are unprofessional !"}
{"text":"The 2 stars is for the food. If it wasn't for that I'd give it 0 stars. The service was horrible! First they take forever to get us our appitizer, during that time they brought us the wrong food. Once we did get our appitizer, about 2 minutes later we got our meals. Not cool, I don't like my food getting cold. Oh our server never gave us utensils so we had to take some from another table. Btw there was 1 guy just putting utensils on tables and he never got around to us. Our server never checked up on us so we had to ask another server for our check.   We do not plan on coming back.  Btw if anyone from the company is reading this our servers name was Chase."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were skeptical at first when greeted by an Italian Arnold Schwarzenegger but the food was great as usual and the service was good although a tad on the creepy side. I like the decor but the not as good as the atmosphere in the sugar factory in the Paris."}
{"text":"Very tasty!! Great atmosphere and treats! Our service was excellent. . Loved the lollipop gobblet"}
{"text":"First, it started off with the four different pronunciations of my friend's last name. Second, our food came out before our drinks. Third, one of my friends ordered an entree and specifically asked for no chicken, guess what? She got chicken. Fourth, one of my other friends ordered Bolognese it came out with a touch of cooker's hair. The manager was eventually called over and our drinks were rolling in. My friends got their replacement food 20 mins after the complaint. They offered us dessert on the house but we never got it because we had to go.    Food: It was okay...  Drinks: Good. Service: Took too long."}
{"text":"I will say that after I writing this review I was compensated by the company and it makes me rethink some of my scalding remarks and overall brings up my personal view for this place, however my views still stand, just to a lesser degree."}
{"text":"To begin with, The Sugar Factory at Town Square has a great staff and an amazing experience. The only minus is that the food comes from a very select menu and is not all that great. Also, it doesn't even compare to The Sugar Factory on the Strip!"}
{"text":"What a cool experience. Great atmosphere, candy, drinks and food. Nell and Carla were fantastic bartenders, hospitable and friendly, and made our experience wonderful! Highly recommended to check out whether you are looking for a quick bite or a drink!!"}
{"text":"Awesome time at Sugar! Richard B. as an awesome server and answered all our questions. Huge menu with something for everyone, the mac 'n cheese ball were the best! Goblets lived up to their reputation. Be sure to come here on your birthday, you get a massive bottle sparkler on a cupcake, like you're living it up in the club!"}
{"text":"Came here during the afternoon after seeing online promo for buy one get one free for the famous goblets. The manager then came over and informed us this deal was no longer available even when we showed said coupon. Food was actually very good. But when the checks came I found out my drink, not a goblet, was the same price as entree. Menu does not show cocktail prices so watch out. Also be warned, the \"souvenir\" cups you get for the goblets are in no way free. They are an additional $15 after paying $35 for the drink. All in all, I would recommend avoiding this touristy gimmick of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Not impressed. We came in to have dessert and coffee after our dinner; it was about 40 minutes before they closed. Both the dessert my wife wanted (plain cheesecake) and the one I did (mudslide ice cream sandwich) were 86'd. By the way, it's great when waitstaff uses lingo with customers (sarcasm). So we both ended up getting different ice cream sandwiches and coffee. So we thought. Nope. They were out of coffee. What??? How do you run out of coffee? So we go the SF Cappuccino which is just plain 'ol cappuccino except it's $8 we found out when we got the bill. And it was gross. Extremely bitter. Kinda like me after this visit. The ice cream sandwiches were just ice cream between 2 rock hard cookies that you couldn't cut through. You'd think the cookies would be soft, no? Ya know, edible.   The service wasn't any better. We had to ask for sugar because he didn't bring it with the $16 worth of cappuccinos. He never came back to ask if everything was okay. He seemed more interested in what music was blaring overhead. Then he disappeared for a good 15 minutes while we were waiting for our check. We had to stop him as he walked by to ask for the check. Which then took another 5 minutes for him to bring. And don't get me wrong, it was not busy at all...so there's no reason it should have taken him that long.   So in summary, I do not recommend this location for its selections, desserts or service."}
{"text":"We had a 4:00 reservation on Saturday.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and we would have been seated without a reservation with no wait.  Our waiter was very slow and not very personable.  We had one of their novelty cocktails.  It was definitely a unique tasty drink but the alcohol was very weak.  (The drink was $30+, so we expected it to have plenty of alcohol.) The food was good but not great.  The waiter didn't even offer us dessert.   We had to ask a manager for the menu to decide whether or not we would have dessert. I am glad we visited the restaurant but don't plan to return."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre, we had bacon and eggs and a veggie omelette, we will try desert next time.                                        The drinks were very good the service was great, Monique our server did a great job.                                                         The guy in the suit, a manager,was a total maniac he was running around apologizing for everything and saying off the wall things.                                            I would definitely come back for the drinks, they have one bar tender who managed to keep up with my girl and I despite our alcoholic tendencies and all of the drinks were very good.   I have them a 4 because I like to drink and their service was great"}
{"text":"I enjoyed their cute atmosphere, it's colorful and fun. Their cocktails are awesome!! They were a bit too sweet for me so the bartender was nice enough to take it easy on the syrup! They were just right after. Their pizza is pretty good too. I'm going to go back and get one of those goblets and maybe order a desert next time!"}
{"text":"So, I ordered the Lollipop Passion and loved it! It is extremely sweet, so if you don't have a sweet tooth then I don't recommend it. The really cool thing about it, though, is the dry ice. At first, all they serve you is a bowl of ice but then they pour your drink in and steam pours out of the huge gauntlet. The process is really cool and if you ever see one of these places you should really go. The only bad thing about it is the price. Each one of the drinks is 30 dollars... Also,  we came around 5 and it looked pretty dead. It would've had a better atmosphere if more people were there and the Vegas lights were lit up. Other than that, it is a really cool place I that I really enjoyed going to!"}
{"text":"What horrible service.   I absolutely LOVE the sugar at Paris, by unfortunately this location was a huge disappointment     It took the hostess several minutes to even acknowledge me standing right in front of her.    After not getting any service for ten minutes after being sat, I got up and walked out.   I mentioned this to a manager on the way out and his response was \"oh, I'm sorry, we're very busy\" and let me walk out.  Never coming back !!"}
{"text":"After leaving the movie theater, we dropped in to Sugar Factory at Town Square. We were greeted and seated immediately. We ordered burgers, pasta and a chicken sandwich.   The atmosphere was relaxed - perfect expression of Vegas. The food was DELICIOUS, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to order.  They were sensitive to my gluten and dairy allergies. A BIG PLUS!!!!!  The price was reasonable. The drinks were PERFECT. Lizzy the bartender is definitely a mixologist!!!,,   Mike, the manager, was super cool. Matt, our server, was phenomenal. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great location, burgers and staff! Loved the shakes and goblet, the pasta was disapointed but we came back the next day for brunch. The waffle and crêpe were fabuleus! Highly recommend this place, they are good accessible to"}
{"text":"Last night my wife & I went to eat at the new Sugar Factory located in Town Square.I read some of the reviews and to my surprise they were anything but spectacular. However, we have wanted to try this place for quite some time. Only we try to steer away from the strip.So we went to see a movie in Town Square and to our surprise we saw a new Sugar Factory .I know it's new because I live in Las Vegas and  I 'm familiar with Town Square. First off, let me tell you we were greeted at the door by a sweet young lady who's name we did not catch. However, I do remember my waitress's name Jessica, cause she greeted us with a enormous smile and very caring and inviting attitude.She not only recommended the Lollipop Passion Goblet, which my wife and I shared and absolutely loved.  She was also very knowledgeable about many other choices, which we will be trying the next time we come back. She asked if we had a chance to check over the menu which we then said yes, but we were still uncertain what we wanted so she recommended  the Chicken Paillard and the Black Angus fillet. Although we did not get the fillet we did decide to order the chicken for my wife and I myself had the Chicken Parmesan. It was nice to know she was so certain of your menu and could assure up of a variety of meals which honestly had my mouth  watering by the end of are ordering. We were really hungry and asked how long, so she recommended an assortment of appetizers to hold us over. We wanted something simple so she recommended the macaroni cheese pops which came out in a timely manner. Shortly followed by the main entree. My wife and I were overly satisfied with the appearance and taste of both our meals, but what I especially appreciated was my waitress Jessica. She was very attentive to our every need. She never even let our waters get fully drank before she came around to refill them for us, which was delightful to know. She was always there to make sure our dining experience was meet to our fullest expectations. Our next time in and to anyone who reads this, I strongly suggest you ask for Jessica as your waitress.We live in Las Vegas and dine out alot and I must say she is one of the best we've had in  the city. Cudoos to The Sugar factory located in the Town Square to giving us not only a wonderful dinning experience but a great memory for my wife and I."}
{"text":"1. The prices are out the roof for how much food you get 2.waiting for food takes an hour .. when I went the place wasn't full 3. Food was cold 4. Drinks didn't even come 4. waist of money don't come here they ain't good hummy"}
{"text":"My first time here and I love it. The menu is playful, fun with a lot of variety. Being able to enjoy made to order crepes with Sugar Factory signature cocktails is delightful. I can't wait to bring my family next time. Great place for adults and family."}
{"text":"I'm so upset... I came in thinking this place was going to be great and it was totally the opposite. Didn't get the drink I specially ordered. The food I ordered was cold when it came out. I'm just in shock that this place was suppose to be really great and it seriously made our night end badly. I just wish someone could've made it right.. ?"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 5/5 because, firstly, the food is amazing!! Excellent burgers, and I had a virgin signature martini (which was excellent). Secondly, a member of my party had a life-threatening peanut allergy. We talked to one of the chefs, Mitch, and he was willing to adapt his recipies in order to accommodate her! Great experience. I recommend it completely!"}
{"text":"Restaraunt is adorable. Loved the ambiance and all of the details. The food however was ok at best. And way overpriced!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. We were waiting for the last guest so we sat at the bar and the bartender paid zero attention to is and when she finally got to us we were about to be sat and the bartenders response was \"well taps cannot be transferred.\" Ok attitude. No worries we will order drinks at the table. Be prepared to wait...and wait. Our server did his spiel got our drink order and we didn't see him for 20min. We didn't get any water and with several \"managers\" walking by you would think one of them would notice...nope. I'm writing this as I sit here waiting for our drinks and server to come back to take our order...not happy."}
{"text":"Im only leaving 1 star out of courtesy. We had reservations,  arrived on time and sat down 30 mins later. It took 15 mins for someone to get our drinks and nearly 15 mins more to get the drinks. I'm sorry, but the hype is just that. We appreciate the mgr trying to right all the wrongs though but... I spoke too soon.  Update: prior to the end of the meal I was presented with a check of $143.00, but with no itemized receipt. Which I paid. As I did a mental tally of what our meal costs, I discovered that I had overpaid. The manager then provided me with a receipt which showed that I had paid for our meal as well as another table. I have never been to a restaurant where they only provided a consumer with the end result of your bill but not actually what you paid for. After this situation was corrected, it was determined that my bill was only $83. I guess I will have to wait to see what my credit card statement says. Never again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has a good vibe. Our server Nissa  gave us wonderful service and will always come back to see her for her."}
{"text":"Dessert was great and our server Lauren was awesome. I Def recommend the peanut butter cup sandwich ! Also great birthday celebration"}
{"text":"Just ate there today food was good but service not so well i had to ask repeadly for a spoon and sugar for my coffee and by the time i got it my coffee was cold, also when paying for the bill i had to do the math while he carriers a tablet that im pretty sure he has a calculator on it to do the math for him thats why im paying and tipping you for also had to chase him down in order to pay the bill after i wrote the totals. We also were asked if its my girlfriends  birthday they asked for there names and made it seem like they were gonna  do somthing and nothing happen i believed they forgot as my waiter Joshua M forgot as well im sure he is nice guy but service was not good espeical for what i paid for"}
{"text":"Extremely discouraged at the service.    It took over 45 minutes to get my food.  The diner was not that busy.    I was not alone with this as I saw two other tables walk out    It appears the management staff just walks bout in a trans and doesn't even comfort the customers with the delay on food delivery.  After all the waiting, they we considerate enough to reduce my bill in half!"}
{"text":"Was doing a little shopping with my boyfriend in TS on Sunday and decided to stop into the new Sugar Factory for some brunch. The host station is outside and we started walking in. the hostess ended up walking us to the bar like we were being sat at a table, which was something Ive never had happen before. I appreciate this however it was a bit strange. I like the casual nature of going to a bar setting and being able to waltz in, check it out and pick where to sit... The bartender, Caley came over with a warm smile, explained the menu and let us know about some specials.  FOOD: It was ok.. for food, we ordered Blueberry Lemon Pancakes to share. those were pretty tasty.. I ordered the Benedict which looked better than it tasted, sadly. I felt like everything was so covered in salt that I didnt want to finish it. even the asparagus. My boyfriend got build your own omelette which was fine. next time we will try lunch items or more pancakes.  DRINKS: let me say, Im a brunch girl. seriously the biggest reason to come is if you enjoy a boozy brunch.  gourmet mimosas and bloody marys (Im not sure if its all weekend or only Sunday) ...Get this: all unlimited for $20... so you can try all the different ones!!! we sampled some over the course of brunch.. a Bacon Bloody Mary with a spicy brown sugar rim (!!!!) and for mimosas we had a Blueberry Lemon mimosa, a Raspberry mimosa, and Tropical mimosa (which was my favorite)..we got to talking with Caley and she told us she moved from New York this summer and was at a mixology type bar there. she came up with these and is going to try out some new ones every Sunday.. Im already excited to make this my new spot on sundays. Ive been to the S.F. at Paris and they dont have specialty brunch cocktails like this. Not many places in Vegas do.  SERVICE:  Caley was great... she knows what shes doing with a cocktail. Even while she was running around making drinks for the servers, she never stopped checking on us. We immediately felt like her friends. The busser (?) came and delivered the food. he seemed very professional and asked if we needed anything else, we needed some extra sauce and he promptly returned with it. there did seemed to be ALOT of managers on duty...almost like bouncers at a nightclub.  all keeping a hawks eye on everything and were buzzing all around, which was slightly uncomfortable and excessive.   -1 star for the food/ weird atmosphere. Im sure it will get better as they get into the groove.  we will be back for more brunch cocktails, lunch, and happy hour.seems like a promising new addition to TS..  it seems they are still working out the kinks since they have just opened."}
{"text":"We had an awesome experience! The drinks are great and we had excellent service from Carla."}
{"text":"Good Atmosphere, Great Food! Worst.Service.EVER!!! I think our waiter was worried about scoring a huge tip from the table next to us and totally ignored us!!! But no worries, the manager John was Amazing and took care of us! Menz was our \"so called\" waiter."}
{"text":"Fun for kids and adults ! Cool hand dryers in the bathroom. Drinks were a little pricey but really good and very unusual."}
{"text":"We have been going to the old location for years, when they closed we were sad.  We recently tried the new location at the Fashion Show Mall. We went on a Sunday evening and it was busy, but not crazy busy. The decor is beautiful. There was plenty of staff visible and the service was great! The milkshake was to DIE FOR! We shared one and it was plenty. We will return."}
{"text":"My party was seated and then quickly forgotten. We waited at least fifteen minutes and no one even took a drink order. To top it off, other tables that arrived after us were being waited on first. No one seemed to notice our table despite an abundance of staff."}
{"text":"OMG!!! We absolutely this place!!!!!! Today was my daughter's 12th birthday, so I took her and my other daughter and invited a few friends. Upon arrival, we were pleasantly greeted; despite being late for our reservation and our waiter, Brandon, provided us with the most exceptional service I've had in years!!!! In fact, all of the employees I encountered were friendly. The decor is chic and I found ambiance whimsical as well as inviting. The food was tasty and the shakes were delicious   that coupled with their presentation...This place has mastered the ability to cater to all ages.  I definitely will be returning especially because I want to have a drink in the \"Chocolate Lounge,\" which the manger was kind enough to let us take a peek at."}
{"text":"We never thought sugar factory had breakfast and let me tell you!!! It was amazing!!!! They have the sweetest most decadent pancakes and the chicken waffles feels so close to home with my Southern roots! It was so fun to see people ordering the huge fish bowl drinks at 10 AM :) Ariel was our server and she was the sweetest"}
{"text":"Seeking a place to eat before attending a movie, my husband and I happened upon Sugar Factory (SF). We were familiar with SF but didn't know they also had a restaurant. Town Square is our \"go to\" spot, away from the Strip, so we were excited to find a new eatery there. Perusing the outside menu intrigued us enough to give it a try. There were items in all of the 16 categories that I would have ordered, so I was excited to get started on this gastronomic adventure. Inside, the restaurant had a fun & relaxing vibe. Each staff person we met was personable & friendly,(hostess & table busser included) which was a good start. Our server, Sarah, was attentive and efficient. The management-Mike and the Chef -Michael Gillet (Corporate Pastry Chef) spent a fair amount of time conversing with us. Everyone treated us like friends, although we were first time diners. There was a minor delay in receiving our meal, but the 2 Mike's went above & beyond to accommodate us. I ordered the All Natural Turkey Burger on a Brioche Bun w/mozzarella, sautéed mushrooms & herb mayo; I omitted the grilled onions and added tomato & lettuce. For me, the bun is the most important part of a sandwich; this one was so delicious, I would have eaten it alone. It was soft, but large & dense enough to cover the patty and contain the contents without falling apart. The burger was prepared exact to my specifications and a mound of crisp fries completed my meal. My husband's Chicken Marsala sautéed w/Roasted mushrooms over Spaghetti was mouthwatering. Both portions were so large, that we'll be able to enjoy the 2nd halves for tomorrow's dinner. I believe they had the largest dessert menu I've ever seen. We shared an Old Fashioned Sundae for Two. Nothing old fashioned about it - it was beautifully presented in a large modern boat-shaped bowl with 3 mounds of gelato separated by mounds of whipped cream ( I should have taken a pix). I selected pistachio, banana and chocolate gelato, w/hot fudge. The pistachio was almost as flavorful as the gelatos we ate in Rome Italy. Shamefully, we devoured it all. I would suggest that they offer the Sundaes for \"1\", to better serve solo diners; diners who do not want anyone dipping in their bowl; or in case diners want to order two different desserts. SF is destined to be our new favorite eatery in Town Square. We will certainly return and will also spread the word."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. I ordered the smoked salmon croissant. My bread was burned and I had to ask for my side of potato. My friends ordered scrambled eggs with cheddar and well done crispy bacon. She received eggs with monterey jack and her bacon was not crispy. We had to track down our waiter for the check. The one salvation for the meal was their chocolate cake. It was superb."}
{"text":"We order ice cream for dessert... for only $14 really!!!  It's the worse ice cream I ever had !!! Taste like water .. No flavor !! Cheap quality!! Chefs what the he'll are you doing ?? Try your food !!  No wonder you guys close 2 times at the Paris casino and Town Square mall locations .. Never come back !!! Save your money !!!"}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricy and not worth it. Spent $14 on a piece of chocolate cake for my bday and it was horrible. The cake was served cold and was very dry. Nothing tasty about it. After that I purchased the smokey goblets for $40 and that was not very tasty either. I realize it's the sugar factory but this drink was way to sweet. Tasted like they added 5 cups of sugar. It was a nice representation and fun environment, staff was nice."}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of Sugar Factory.  When I worked on then strip I used to take my staff to then location at Paris.  I was so impressed that about 2 years ago I had my team dinner there and then last year we had a bachelorette dinner there too.  I always enjoy then appetizers and fruity cocktails! This past Wednesday my husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary with the kids at the location at Town Square because my daughter wanted to go to the park and I wanted my daughter to enjoy the desserts. The positive as I walked in is that the drinks were 50% off (I later found out that appetizers are too based on the yelp page and my server didn't even give us the 50% off, even after I had to correct him on giving me 50% off the drinks- maybe he wasn't sure if we would tip off the regular price- who knows?).    First disappointment - no bubble gum iced tea  Second disappointment - our server didn't even tell us about Happy Hour but he told the table next to us  Third disappointment- our appetizer baked brie took forever. My husband noticed that the table of girls got the same appetizer before us and they ordered way after us.  I said maybe ours is coming out next.  My 1 year old was a little fussy so we went walking around the mall.  I came back about 15 minutes.  My husband was shaking his head and didn't look too happy.  I said what happened.  He said he watched our baked brie go from the table next to us (as they finally told the server it wasn't theirs) to inside the restaurant to right back to us.  He didn't say anything as we pretty much don't like to say anything especially when other people are cooking your food.  I know I should have but I just wanted to enjoy my anniversary dinner with my family.  My husband was already irritated and grouchy that I just wanted to eat my food and leave. A minute later our entrees were dropped and no silver ware on the table.  We asked for another set of silverware because she only bought 2 and there were 4 of us.  The server said to my husband you need one too...um, yes, how else would he eat his crepe?   We didn't get to enjoy desserts because we were upset with the experience and just wanted to leave and take then kids to the park.  Positives- food was great - macaroni pops, garbage salad and chicken crepe was very delectable.  (Although we didn't enjoy the brie because it was cold and the fact that it was sitting on another table was just not appetizing after)  I really hope they make it at that spot because that's the 3rd or 4th restaurant in there.  They really need to step up the game with service and let everyone know about happy hour and give them the happy hour price!"}
{"text":"Hmmm....not for me.   But I can see the appeal of this place. The decor is fresh and modern and fun. The location is convenient (Town Square near the movie theatre). And the concept is smart--who doesn't want creative sweets that are both delicious to eat and beautiful to look at?  I'm not the audience for this place, so feel free to ignore my review if you are less concerned with the quality of the food than the location, and celebrity-infused image.   The first time we went, the service was terrible. We were seated outside and promptly forgotten about. We waited a ridiculous amount of time for our food, we're never checked on to ask for additional condiments, and watched a number of employees walk by and lounge about while we waited for our waitress. We'd brought our neice to enjoy the ambiance (she's 11) and she did. She loved her burger, but what I tased was a solidly average hamburger. We had the pizza burger (neither flavorful or notable), fettuccine Alfredo (same), Mac and cheese pops (no), and chicken caesar crepe (goopy).  We didn't want to make scene because we didn't want to tarnish her experience, but we were so frustrated that we left without ordering the dessert. There was a gentleman who seemed to be a manager milling about in the front, but his presence didn't seem to spur our waitress to provide service.   But who goes to this kind of place for savory lunch? No one. So I didn't write a review and kept my generally negative opinion to myself.    We recently returned with my daughter looking for a dessert experience. I can get cake and ice cream anywhere, but we wanted to bathe I'm some decadent delights. To Sugar Factory!   The overall experience was much better, but the desserts were not as well made as we'd hoped. Between us we enjoyed a few orders of popcorn shrimp, a s'mores martini, the red velvet cake and a chocolate cake.   The shrimp was crispy, tender, and flavorful. So much so, that we ordered another round of them. While there was some miscommunication about the sides for the order (see LEMON STORY below), we were very pleased with the dish.  But the desserts were a disappointment. They were fine, just not great. The cakes were on the dry side and lacked distinct flavor. They were both nestled with ice cream and whipped cream that could have been organized with ingredients at home. The s'mores martini was was rich and felt luxe, but was missing the marshmallows promised in the picture. When I asked about my beloved marshmallows, the waiter brought me three mini marshmallows on a saucer. Not a big deal, just not as advertised/pictured.   SERVICE: What can I say? The service was MUCH better the second visit, and I appreciate that even though our waiter was busy, he never forgot about us and would pop in to see if we were ok. Our waiter felt like he was reading from a service manual, but that was such a vast improvement over our first experience. Honestly, it felt like they were trying to step up the service with specific talking points and direction. That's a plus in my book.  This place was fine. The second experience was better and we received MUCH better service when we ate inside. All in all, the food was mediocre, and were desserts are ok. I know they are popular, but they have the feel of a place who is still ironing out the wrinkles.  I don't plan to return, but with the modern decor and house music gently pumping in the background, I can see why others would.   LEMON STORY: I asked for extra lemon with the shrimp (it came with one slice for three of us) and the server asked me if I wanted \"one\" lemon. Confused, I responded, \"Yes.\" I thought he was going to slice up one whole lemon and bring to to us. I mean, why else would he ask if I wanted \"one\" lemon when I asked for \"extra\"?  Instead, he returned with ONE extra slice of lemon. That's a total of two lemon slices. We laughed at the incident and then ordered a second round of the shrimp because it was tasty. This time, when I asked for extra lemon, the same server didn't ask how many extra lemon slices I wanted, he just brought one additional slice. Is that a thing now?"}
{"text":"Great service, super attentive and amazing food and drinks. Awesome playlist that had us singing at our table and that set a great mood for the rest of the night! After seeing the chocolate lounge upstairs we wished we had had more time to stay and hang out... absolutely beautiful!"}
{"text":"WORSE Restaurant  on the Strip...STARY AWAY.. When it was located at the Paris hotel this was an awesome place. Great food and service.  Then they moved to Fashion mall, it sucks big time. I went there when they reopened and had bad service and the food tasted bad. They took off the menu, the great tasting drinks. My Well done  hamburger was raw. sent it back and it came back medium. Just ate it and left. My wife's club sandwich was dry.   We tried it again on my birthday. Again, really bad service, several of our party had to send their food back. We bought a Big Smokin drink for the kids for $35.00. mostly filled with ICE. about 10 oz of fruit punch and very little smoke. we sent it back because the fruit punch was sour and tasted like crap. the kids hated it. it was suppose to be a sweet drink. My BLT bacon was raw.  We all left their vow to never come back.  HOWEVER.   Last week my wife and I were at Wynn and she bought a groupon for breakfast at the Sugar Factory. So we though, How bad can they ruin breakfast? Well they did. I ordered an Eggs Benedict and my wife got a Bacon egg croissant.  Mine came with salmon on it, and my wife got a ham croissant sandwich with no egg. I told the guy who brought it that it was wrong and he goes, OH and walks away. We finally got our waitress  to sent it back.  30 min later, I got my eggs benedict cold. my with got bacon and eggs. eggs were raw and bacon was raw. We talked to the manager who was ruid and she said she would comp  another meal for my wife to go. I just ate mine cold. so they took back her bacon and eggs and she ordered a Club to Go. So basically we gave them a groupon for 2 meals, I ate one, sent one back and the Club was suppose to be free. we got a bill for 3 meals. I was pissed. she said she would take that off and then came back and wanted $5.00 for tax. 20 min later still no Club. At that point my wife and I left. NO CLUB. $60 groupon for a cold egg benedict.   The next day we went to Denny's got 2 breakfast for $14.50 and it was hot and yummy and quick."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Terrible food! I'd give less than one star if that was possible. Not sure how this place is still open."}
{"text":"I hosted a small get together the other night for the local chapter of a collective I'm part of and we had the best time! I had reached out to the restaurant in advance to make sure everyone could pay with separate checks and make sure they could accommodate us as we needed and they were so helpful. When I got to the restaurant, they took me to a corner booth and helped me set up all of our materials. Our host answered any and all questions and stayed to make sure our small group had all arrived and we were settled (Thanks again, Madison!). Our server, Jason, took amazing care of us as did the rest of the staff who kept our water glasses full and made sure we had everything we could possibly need.   We had the Rainbow Sliders which were so yummy (and super photogenic) and three of the craziest milkshakes I've ever seen in my life (Twinkie Dinkie, Tie Dye, Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake). I literally had a slice of cheesecake sitting on top of my milkshake! My club sandwich was so big it's literally served as three meals ($16 might sound pricey but given it's been three lunches, it's a good deal). When it was time for our bills, they were brought out separately as discussed in advance with absolutely no fuss. That never happens anywhere! One of the managers even gave us a tour of the chocolate lounge upstairs and offered to take photos for us in front of all the cool displays.  I was a HUGE fan of the original Sugar Factory when it first opened inside Paris Hotel and Casino. I rarely go to one place multiple times but Sugar Factory was my favorite place to frequent (and that says a lot). When the menu changed I wasn't happy and I didn't love the incarnation at Town Square. I wasn't sure what to expect of this new location but when I walked in I was thrilled. It has the same look and feel of the original and the menu even has the original items (many of which were removed when the menu was remodeled). If you eat here, make sure to go upstairs to see all of the displays outside the chocolate lounge! It's an Instagram dream come true (especially the miniature carousel). Yes, the restaurant is ornate and over the top but it's Las Vegas, get over it.   Thank you Madison, Jason, Mery and all the wonderful staff at Sugar Factory for making our gathering so amazing! I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time , and let's say it was awesome. Menz was the best waiter ever he asked me was my drinks amazing and was my food good . And he gave me all the facts about which drink was worth it and which meal was delightful. And he also was charming and handsome . I mean the food and drinks were good but he was even better :) . And I can't wait to come back and see him again ."}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. We were seated right away and our server , drew , brought us over waters as we were being seated. The staff is super friendly and were constantly checking in on us   Our food came out quick and was absolutely delicious. The grilled chicken sandwich and turkey and Brie sandwich was delicious as was our fish bowl Mai Tai   I would 100% recommend this sugar factory location to everyone living in and visiting vegas"}
{"text":"Server was great food was cold waited over a hour for our food. Manager said it was only a 20 min wait which was incorrect as social media showed the exact time we ordered and recieved  our drinks. Manager tried to act like he cared which it was obvious he didnt. I would strongly recommend not going here!! Expensive cold food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to the sugar factory in the fashion show mall because they have a Groupon specific to that location, specificly for brunch. We went, wish we didn't. We had to park on the opposite side of the mall because the gates were locked by the Macy's and there was a convention so no parking near there. That's fine. By this time it's about 930am and we are standing outside of S.F., the doors were locked, someone inside flashes me 10 fingers, my assumption they open at 10, since there were no hours posted outside. However on the Groupon it says they open at 9am? I brought that to the servers attention when we finally do go inside. He said he told the manager, hopefully they will fix that sooner than later, especially since it wouldn't let me leave a review on Groupon since I waited to buy it, just to make sure the there wasn't any other specifics. Thank goodness, I would have been even more angry. Mind you I am feeling pretty hangry, walking around for 30 because they can't seem to post the right time on the promotional ad. Also the sever says \"we do open at 9 Sat.&sun.\" I said \"ok but the Groupon says only valid Mon.-fri.\" That makes sense thanks for clearing it up. Ok, I'm ready to eat, the Groupon says let your server know you are using a Groupon before ordering. Ok. Then tells us the only dish available for the Groupon is the on in the picture on Groupon although the highlight promote pancakes and waffles which is what I wanted. 2 eggs, 1 slice of French toast, country potaoes, and 2 pieces of meat was in the pic. Ok. I thought wow! The Groupon value is $60 and I'm paying $36 at 40% off. Oh and the Groupon is for specifically only for 2 people. If we did decide to order off the menu, what we wanted it would have been less than $60, hold less than $36! What was the deal breaker was we were going to settle for the breakfast in the picture, we were already there and starving, we told the server we don't eat meat if we could sub it for some toast or fruit. That was an issue, he said he has to ask the chef. Came back and said they just budget the Groupon for what's in the picture but we could sub for a cup of berries this time. Budget for what's in the picture?! $60 worth I guess wasn't enough for toast instead of meat. They really need to take that Groupon down, so frustrated!!"}
{"text":"Had a tremendously horrible experience at this sugar factory. My friend and I went here at 4 pm on a Sat we had two goblets She had lollipop passion and I had an ocean blue goblet we both ordered Fettuccini Alfredo so we get our drinks and everything is fine until I look down and see a freaking dead fly in my goblet I almost threw up in my mouth I tried not to make a big scene there was a little family sitting next to us to be having a good time but Lord oh Lord I couldn't believe my eyes I couldn't believe there was a dead fly in my drink! So when the server came I told him in a nicely manner he apologized and he called his supervisor over and he said, \"are you sure it's a fly?\" Like seriously so I took it out my drink with the silverware and put it on the table and said, \"What does it look like to you.\"  He was very nonchalant about the situation. I explained to him how I hate complaining when I go out I normally wouldn't complain but this was just unacceptable. At this point I lost my appetite my friends goblet was fine she finished eating we paid and left. The manager offered to give me a discount on my goblet I said no thanks I was disgusted with the customer service and the dead fly. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place has amazing drinks and food. The atmosphere is incredible. Hands down one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Said I wouldn't go back and I should have listened to my own advice.  Once again service slow, food not what i ordered and the meal definitely not worth the money.  Great concept but the food on the menu looks way better than what you actually receive.  I am definitely never going back!"}
{"text":"Last night was the first time at The Sugar Factory at Town Square.  My wife and I each had the Salmon special and by far it was the best we ever had! Our waitress was fantastic also.  A great night!"}
{"text":"Love their Caesar salad and blue cheese bacon burger! Very comfortable seating and ambiance"}
{"text":"The server, who asked to be identified as \"Misty with an eye,\" although I'm certain she has two eyes, is an excellent server! She served us with an attitude that made us feel welcome and we'll definitely be back again! Promote at once! Thanks Misti!"}
{"text":"Is there an option for 0 stars? Third time I came here and tonight for my birthday. 1st time around grand opening had a reservation for Valentines day and they neglected to call and say they were not opening on time, we showed up and had no where to eat on Valentines day- I wrote to restaurant on FB i think or company site got no response. 2nd time decided to try the place for my sisters birthday about a year later, it was terrible. Food was gross sent back a couple things (waitress even said meat looked terrible) the \"fried\" ice cream my bf ordered was soup and disgusting. Our waitress gave us a 50% off food card for our next time she told us they may have had an off night and to try again. So here we are my birthday. Came with some friends ate, had the kind kong sundae. Our friends gifted us a groupon we used for 2 duck drinks, at the end of the meal were told we cannot use the groupon with the 50% and we cannot use the groupon on a separate check (in a group couldnt split the check I am pretty sure they could but ok probably just wanted auto gratuity cause I definitely would not have tipped)  Waiter said he told us that in advance and no he did not. So we ended up paying an additional $65 for drinks that were gifted to us and now we return the groupon to her? LOL because no def not coming back to get them another day. I am sure there was a much better way to handle it in the view of customer service. 3 times now and each time was a terrible experience, oh not to mention a goblet is $35 even with no alcohol that is ridiculous but side note and not fully part of the issue. I used to love this place when it was at Paris even Town Square was better than this. Also your menu online for fashion show doesn't really exist in restaurant (also part of 2nd visit). Terrible choice for my birthday dinner. thx"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was lively. Our services Richard was very helpful & always checking on us. Love this place & recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"First off, my friend and I were walking around yesterday and came across Sugar Factory and were super excited because we thought they no longer exist seeing how the Hexx took its place at the Paris hotel. The host greets us and asks if we want to sit at the outside bar, which we asked if it would be ok if we sit inside seeing how it was super windy and we were cold. He sat us in front of the door which made us feel like we might as well just sat at the outside bar. We tried asking to move, but that ended up making things more complicated. I tried to say it was totally fine, seeing how I do understand how a restaurant and hosting system works due to the fact that I've been a waitress for 7 years and understand that things just can't happen. But then a manager came and said that he was going to have the door closed for us, which made it worse because I knew that was a shortcut for waiters and bussers and tried telling him it was really fine. So the manager did it anyways and told all the waiters and bussers that they had to go around and I could hear one of the waiters talking how over the top it was and that we should just move and even our own waiter was annoyed with us which made me feel mortified. We sat right in front of the door which is right next to the bartender and every time they walked by our table, it was just them talking about us. Now the fun part, our food. My friend got the turkey burger which was super dry and looked like someone sat on it. I got the white chocolate burger and it was like our waiter, rare. It was cold and not even close to cooked. I couldn't ask for them to take it back one because I felt bad for causing so much inconvenience and two because our waiter checked on us once. I really do understand the frustration and patience one has to have in this industry and honestly, my friend and I weren't in a big hurry and would of waited for a different seat and I understand that the reason certain tables aren't opened is because it's a closed off section that's either for the closing shift or someone who's section is cut off due to the fact that they're about to leave, but we asked the host for inside away from the cold and he dropped us in front of the opened door and when we asked if we could get something else he had this attitude that said take it or leave it. Cool. Again, I totally understand when it's busy and you just hope the customer just goes with it, but hey, that's the job; and if you're going to talk crap about a customer, do it in the back, not right in front of them where we clearly can hear you. Of course when I asked for the check, that was when he was super attentive. Probably couldn't wait for us to leave. Check was over $100 for awful food and average drinks. Still left a nice tip because I felt horrible the entire time. So sad that it was so awful, I've been looking forward to coming here once I turned 21 and it was a complete let down. Just another overpriced store, average service, hyped up because it's on the strip. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday celebration. Had been once before and wasn't too excited but I had to give them a chance for the birthday girl. Food was again sub par, we both had to season our pasta, and waitress took forever. Have yet to have a good meal there. We all got goblets, they are just gimmicks barely any alcohol. Pretty place though. Everywhere else in town square was packed, it was Saturday night, this place was half empty. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here to treat a friend for her birthday, I bought the groupon deal. We sat inside because it was too hot to sit in the patio, I ordered the lollipop drink with my groupon which was delicious, amazing presentation, it was a large goblet. We then ordered the appetisers brushetta, and fried mac and cheese pops, the bruschetta , the tomatoes were old, the fried mac and cheese pops , needed to be fried more, When it came to the main course, sadly the chinese chicken salad, looks nothing like the picture on the menu, the lettuce was old, tasted weird, we had call the manager to return the food. On a positve note the drinks were really delicious, the  mai tai a large drink in the goblet and during happy hour, its worth it, but i would not come here for the food, I would only recommend this place for the drinks, I would not return to eat here, maybe only for the drink specials."}
{"text":"So...I've walked by multiple Sugar Factory within strip hotels but never took the time to go in and have a meal, given they are always busy.  So it is pleasant to be able to experience Sugar Factory away from the tourist crowd.    We started our night here for drinks and light meal!  The place got a nice face-lift, tables were replaced with nice comfy booth but the set-up seems to be the same from when it was The Meatball Spot.  Service definitely improved from when it was The Meatball spot.  The menu is impressive, especially the fist 12 pages, which is ALL adult drinks with a fun, tasty twist!  We just stuck to the simple food for the evening, chicken fingers, fried macaroni cheese pops, bruschetta, and baked brie.  Now here comes the best part...the drink menu!  I ordered adult root beer and the carmel machiatto martini!    And don't forget the reason why it's call The Sugar Factory, the CANDY and the bling lollipops!  I took the time to purchase some for my bridesmaids as part of their gifts.  The only reason why it only gets 3 stars is because I haven't had a chance to try their significant dishes.  There will definitely be another update review soon!  My suggestion is to take a visit, rather it inside of Paris Hotel or at Town Square, this place is definitely a place to visit, to taste the delightful sweetness it offers!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for my nephews 9th birthday we got seated right away which was amazing cause we had a party of 9! So we went up to the chocolate room and sat down and waited and waited and waited for our waiter to finally come when he came he seemed so annoyed with us and we had a few questions about the menu because obviously we had never been their before he answered us so short and then left to get our water which took another 30 min then left and came back to take our order! We had a few questions about getting a candle and singing happy birthday and he was really really rude and seemed like he didn't even want to be at our table so we didn't end up doing anything extra which was a major bummer to our nephew cause that's the whole reason we went their! We wouldn't have left a tip at all if it wasn't for the tip included with a larger party because he never was at our table it was all these other waiters who were way nicer than him! We are so sad we had such a horriable time because we had high hopes!   UPDATE******* I was messaged very quickly by the business and the man was very very nice he asked to call and talk to me and let him know more about our experience! Great customer service from him!"}
{"text":"OH MY YUMMY!  my husband and i like to visit places off the las vegas strip and find out what the locals like to eat. after visiting another restaurant in town square, we remembered we passed The Sugar Factory and Boy, are we GLAD we did! we had sundaes and ice cream sandwiches that were to die for! they offer goblets of their Signature 60 oz. drinks, sandwiches, burgers, brunch on Sunday, pizzas, etc...   we had a Fantastic Server - Lauren. she was friendly, polite, patient with us while our eyes glazed over looking at the menu, and promptly brought us our check when she knew we were ready for it. the atmosphere, decor, music, food, and service will encourage us to come back on our future trips to las vegas! check out their menu:   http://sugarfactory.com/sites/default/files/SF_AB_Town_Square_Menu.pdf  i will post up pictures since they are worth a thousand words.  Thank you Lauren for a Wonderful Experience!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is famous for their treats and the elaborate drinks that they have here. I found out when visiting that they usually get a ton of celebrity visitors in Vegas and there are actually drinks named after a few of them (unfortunately one of those celebrity drinks was created and named after Pitbull aka Mr. 305).  That is neither here nor there, we came with a group of us who had gotten a Groupon deal on a couple of the huge Duckie alcoholic slushies and thank goodness we did. The prices are insanely high from what I saw on the menu but for Vegas I guess that is to be expected.   The flavors were decent (I mixed Pina Colado and Rum) and by the time I finished I felt as though I had gallons of liquid in my stomach, I think it's because I actually did. Make sure you prep beforehand if you want to get one of the larger drinks and stay hydrated when enjoying the Vegas strip during or after you consume!"}
{"text":"The goblets were amazing and they had a coupon where you buy an entree and get half off of a goblet. The drinks alcoholic and non alcoholic were really tasty. Overall very impressed. The entrees were pretty solid. My gf got the ny strip and it was amazing. I had the seafood platter and honestly it was ok not really worth the $34 they charge for the plate. There are other viable options on there but honestly this was a great place to eat and drink and has a great atmosphere"}
{"text":"Two stars for all the glitz and glamour. However,food is not great. My friends and I tried their bruschetta which is a disappointment,wings which were bland, and ceasar salad which is mostly croutons. I guess it's best to just try their huge goblet drinks which is what all the \"stars\" are having on the projected screens but prepare to spend  $40 for that. It was nice to try this place but there are better options around."}
{"text":"I been to the sugar factory at the pairs hotel and casino I love the food service and everything about it,when I found out that one opened up at town square mall I was excited.   You see I wrk at the strip and I try to avoid going to the strip as a locale. So my boyfriend and I went to have a dinner date at the sugar factory, I called and ask to have a table ready for two for 8pm, I called around 640pm so with enough time. We got there at 745pm they told us we had to wait 5min, and I was okay with it even though it was cold out because we knew we where waiting for the best burger in town and great drinks. So we wait 5mins pass then 20mins pass finally we get a table and sadly it was by the door, but still I was okay because I know how great the food is. So my server comes up to us Monique got us stared with drinks and we even tried the mac and cheese with tomato sauce (great by the way) we both order the factory burger  as are main dish now this is where it all goes WRONg   My BF ordered it well done no veggies with onion rings, I got it no tomato with fries. It toke all most 25-35min for us to get are food and that just because the people next to us who came 15mins after us and was a table of 4 got there food b4 us. So we finally got are food and may I say we still have not said nothing we still have a smile on we did not say why the other table got there food b4 us nothing. So are food comes and not only is it over cooked (burn) but it was nasty I was so sad. Both are burgers had no sauce no onion rings inside it.  You can tell that there is no communication in the back house, don't tell me that my burger is broil I wrk in the f&b department my dad was a chef at the red rock I know what is burn and dry and what is broil.  But the front of the house GREAT the 1st person I told about my issue she tried to fix it (I'm sorry I did not get your name) and let others know that I was unhappy and the hole front staff tried to make it better for us. They went as far as giving us are meal drinks and they added a free frozen hot coco all for free all I paid for was the mac and cheese pops. And I have to say bing unhappy and a bad dinner but leaving happy because thy went over and beyond to make sure we left happy. And we did. We will go back and give them a sec chance and MONIQUE your GREAT THANK YOU I will ask for you next time we visit. The only reason we will return is because of are server and the customer service. Other wise the kitchen needs help :( the only reason I give them 5 stares is because of Monique and because I remember how the burger at the one at the pairs tasted like."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start...we walked up to the restaurant & of course my kids want a picture with the big yellow duck. They get up by the duck & go to sit on it & someone from the restaurant comes out & yells at them. Put a sign up if you don't want kids climbing on the duck, it is an attractive nuisance! Then we go to the front to be seated & are seated at a table that is very wobbly. I ask to be moved to a different table that is not wobbly; they move us to another slightly less wobbly table. We wait at least 10 minutes before our waiter comes to the table. Actually another waiter had to tell him to wait on us. So we order...it takes forever to get our coffee which is cold and the orange juice the kids ordered comes when they are almost done eating. The OJ was GROSS, dark in color. We got our meals & mine was the completely wrong thing. So the waiter takes it back & brings me what I ordered. My husband got an omelette that had no taste & some toast. No butter or jelly is offered for the toast, so he asks for jelly. About 10 minutes goes by & he asks again for jelly & now fresh toast. The waiter told us they were getting fresh jelly out of the fridge...what?!?! What, really...it takes over 10 minutes to get jelly out of the fridge...ummmm ok.   Now the coffee situation...you would think that when you order coffee you would get a hot cup of coffee...no, not here. And when we asked for new, hot coffee the waiter brings one cup and tells us that is the last cup & their coffee maker is broken and the coffee they got from Starbucks is gone. WTF! Seriously!   Now, I expect a place to be very nice when I'm paying $15-$18 for one breakfast dish. Not the case. As I stated both tables were wobbly, the crevice around the table had old, nasty food in it, NO COFFEE, black cloth napkins stuffed under table legs to make the tables not wobble & there were wires hanging down from a chandelier. It is really the little things this place is missing! It's all the little things that add up!   We will never, ever go back. The manager did offer for us to come back later for dessert...nope, no thank you, not even for free!  Update to this review: we did get our meal for free. This still did not change the experience we had. I'd rather pay full price & have 5-star experience!   After I posted this review we were offered to come back. Management said they would make a reservation & provide us with a 5-star experience. I accepted as our kids really wanted to have a huge milkshake. Then I get another message stating she didn't realize our meal had been comped & she was confused that I still gave a one star review. Really? I was a little shocked. Yes, our meal was comped because it was a horrible experience. I was told they would give the kids free milkshakes and basically asking me to post another review & make it positive. I declined & then was told basically that I am trying to take advantage of them.   Really think about choosing a different restaurant if you are considering this one!"}
{"text":"This was something on mine and my girls bucket list when we came to Vegas... I don't know if we came at the wrong time or what... But it was mediocre asssfff. The food was OK... The mac & cheese bites were the best thing that we ordered. The service was crappy. Dude was nice and all but we literally watched him stand in the middle of the dining room floor texting. Not a good look. The drink is obviously supposed to be sweet and for show- but for the amount of money, you would think two smaller sized women would at least feel a buzz after sharing a whole goblet. But nope- it was basically like drinking a gallon of Kool-Aid. I would go again with someone who has never gone before because it's definitely cool to see the drink get poured over the dry ice but other than that... not too impressed."}
{"text":"This place was great! I took my best friend for her birthday and she loved it. The service was good we got our drinks and food fast and everything tasted amazing ! Will be back :)"}
{"text":"Very slow and poor service, and they were not very busy. 15 minutes after sitting down I flagged our server down as we kind of wanted to order drinks and she made a bad face.  15 minutes after ordering those drinks weer had to flag a different person down to ask about the drinks because our server wad not in sight.  Things improved after we complained to the manager, that didn't change the fact that the food was not very good.  Won't be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious! White chocolate coconut frozen hot chocolate was to die for!  Service was a bit slow and seemed like everyone was a trainee."}
{"text":"This place definetly did not live up to the hype. Food was ok, but not worth the money you spend. There was food under my table and it took 5 minutes to get mayo and mustard for the burger I ordered."}
{"text":"So around 9:00pm on Saturday May 24th I had called Sugar Factory inside the Town Square Mall to make reservations for 10:30pm to sit outside for a party of 9. We arrived at 10:30 with just half of our party, and the rest of the party showed up like 10:45 and that's when we had just ordered all our drinks. We receive our drinks like not even 5mins later. Ok when it comes around to 11:40 the waiter came up to our table said last call on drinks we close at 12pm when on there website it says 1am btw. I'm like wait what?!! They should have told us that when I was making the reservation that night at 9p, that FYI We close at 12pm but they apparently Didn't! So we go and order more drinks. So the waiter gave us our last round of drinks mind you 60oz drinks. And he gives us our bill right after as he leaves and says to us we can take our time and hang out. Then this buser girl starts walking around to see how we are doing like kinda just to push us out. And then about 10mins later the part that pissed me off they started shutting off the lights of the whole restaurant including the outside area where we were still enjoying our $27 beverage and also turned off the music. I was very upset! we just payed $300+ on our tab and your trying to seriously kick us out now. And mind you the person doing the light shutting off was the 2 managers themselves!!!! Then buser girl comes out again mind you it's prob 12:40ish and I told her I feel like your trying to kick us out by shutting the lights & music off. I had told her I've even working for costumer service for over 12 plus years & I've worked in a restaurant business what you guys are doing is very disrespectful. And she told me \"I'm not trying to kick you the people inside want to go home I get paid hourly so I can careless how long you stay.\" At this time she walks away to tell someone how I was complaining. And some other guy comes not even a manager to speak for them since they didn't want to hear it from me I can see, and apologizes to me and says that they are under new management and he apologizes for everything that had happened. He got my info. Still yet have heard from anyone. I will NEVER EVER COME BACK AGAIN! I will go to the one at the Paris Hotel where the drinks where 100% better and actually decorate your cup the way the menu picture appears to look like."}
{"text":"Fun place for the family. Prices are high but this is Vegas, baby. Food is good. The \"damn that's amazing\" moments are with the milk shakes. They are ridiculously good in presentation and taste. We had the Dulce de Lecha. Wow! Service was good/-polite but not terribly speedy. Get a Groupon to ease the pain of the cost."}
{"text":"Will never return. Purchased a groupon. We were excited to try it after a Vegas show. Got there about 9:45pm. Menu is a book so took us 20 min or so to look at everything. It was apparent they were closing. Nice waiter was the only saving grace. Milkshakes come out at the time we are told they are out of the ice cream flavor that was to come on our sundae. So as you can see the sundae hadn't been started. He offers us different flavors. We are fine with that. We ask what are the options. No list of flavors. We had to get up to go see and when we did most didn't even have a label so no idea what the were. We settled on 2 flavors but very unimpressed with 2 of them.  Our sundae comes out and immediately I think something is missing. No crushed Oreos and no caramel. This is a signature sundae not something we created. We ordered coffee figuring we'd warm up with it while we waited and it didn't come until the ice cream. It was awful.  5.00 a cup we expected better flavor and the option of more than one cup. They took off for the sundae. We asked to remove the coffee and he was not happy about it. Manager says \"you drank the cup right?\"  The one late arriving bad coffee. Used a Groupon thank goodness but was still very expensive. Totally not worth it. We went for a fun experience and this was definitely a fail. Took a picture of my kids milkshakes and was not excited about the dirty mop pail in the background of the picture. . Save your money."}
{"text":"Service was great. Nissa areas extremely helpful and accommodating. I definitely recommend her as a waitress and will come back and ask for her in the future. We got the Lollipop Passion and a basket of fries. Everything was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I mean what could get better than sweets and alcohol, well good service just adds the cherry on top! Absolutely amazing staff, CASE, KIM on the main bar down stairs you both are amazing and the reason why people sit at bars to get an experience with a little bit of excitement thank you for keeping us entertained! AND ugh Shaun the manager absolutely over the top service, checked on us and even recommended a MUST have goblet! We shall be back ! Keep up with the sweet service and the drinnnnnks!"}
{"text":"Sugar Factory is an ok experience. The food lacked flavor. The service started out great but gets noticeably bad the last 75% of your time there. The music is really loud. The tables are small while the plates are huge- my friend had to put her plate in her lap because there was no where else on the dinky table. The prices for the Goblets are high so look for check in deals on Yelp and other voucher websites or skip them altogether. I'd go back with the realization that their Happy Hour sucks.   We went after reading about the happy hour and what a rip-off. I'd have been more pleased if the Goblets were 50% off- end of story. Inside the server said buy one Goblet and get select apps for $3. I figured it was a great deal and thought you could choose 2 or 3 apps for $3 each, I mean the Goblet is the price of an entree at dinner for goodness sake. Well you could only choose ONE app at that price PER Goblet. I chose the burger thinking I was getting a great deal. Not so much. The burger came out and it was honest to goodness the size of a slider! It was not as others have posted pictures of who went earlier when the restaurant first opened. They honestly thought I was going to pay $3 for that little thing. The server, while nice and all smiles, failed to mention that. I'm not a greedy person but these servers should learn how to describe what they are selling their patrons.   I sent the slider back and ordered a burger. The table next to us suffered the same fate and they sent their little slider back too and asked for a traditional sized sandwich which is $13. That burger didn't arrive for 20 minutes. Three people walked by and kept saying \"itll be right out\". I wasn't in a hurry, but at a certain point you start to notice. The burger arrived and it was cooked medium (noticeably pink in the middle) so I'm not sure what took so long to cook it. lt looked great and juicy but it lacked ANY and ALL seasoning. It was bland as shit and there was no salt in sight. Even with the crispy onions strings they didn't help.  The Goblet was great but you'd get sticker shock if they listed the price of them on the menu in fact they don't list the price for ANY of their drinks. I despise sneaky restaurants that do that. You have to ask the server and it becomes a talking point when it shouldn't be. $39 for a drink is not chump change for any time of the day. On top of that they ran out of all citrus fruits at the bar- no lemons for the water, no limes for the vodka soda and no lemons for my $39 Iced Tea Vodka drink. The server had the audacity to bring over 1 (One) sad lemon slice from the end of a lemon with all the white pith on a big plate. It wasn't enough juice in that thing to squeeze a drop in a thimble. During dinner a server walks in from the back with bags of citrus fruits from the local grocery store. Who is running this operation? Get it together.  Towards the end of the meal, as usual, the server disappears and we have to ask random people and managers to bring us our check.This has become an annoying part of dining out lately. You'll get great service at the start and then it tapers off dramatically to no service at all- then they hoover over you to leave a 20% tip, but were absent the last 75% of the meal. Oddly they don't even have check presenters here. Everything is ordered and check is presented on a ipad style device. Its quick, but we never were presented with a itemized bill when they swiped our credit card or after the charge was processed. Its best to ask for a bill BEFORE paying and keep a tally of the charges."}
{"text":"My sweetie took me here for Valentines as a \"surprise\" though it had been the place I was hoping she would take me to!  She made reservations to avoid any imposing crowds. This is the town square location so it's nice to not have the hustle 'n bustle of the Strip vibe.  We watched other couples drinking the 36oz goblets of sugary liquor and Dana giving me the eyes of \"would you be able to finish this?\" Instead, I suggested we order individual cocktails that looked more tasty.  She ordered the grape crush and I had the root beer float. Mine tasted stronger which I enjoyed (and finished!)  They offered a Vday prix fixe menu, but we opted for the regular menu since I am the picky vegetarian. . .  I nommed on the rigatoni marinara which was very good; and my italian princess had the fettuccine alfredo with chicken. I do appreciate that on the menu a \"V\" represents that a dish can be made vegan.   Now dessert is the reason my baby took me here. Even though we were both fairly stuffed from the meal, I consulted her opinion briefly and promptly ordered the \"signature fondue\" with a choice of milk, white, or dark chocolate. We opted for milk.  It was yummy indeed! Portion sizes were pretty average, and pricing is in the range of medium to expensive.    Sugar Factory definitely provides a sugar rush combined with a romantic vibe. My next goal is to try the weekend brunch & a signature lollipop."}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is extremely expensive!!!  I spent over $14 on a small bag of candy.   Yes, they do have a big selection of different candies but I don't think it's worth the price.  I tried the watermelon sours, watermelon gummy bears and watermelon sour slices. Yes, I love watermelon but I don't love watermelon enough to spend $14 on a bag of sugary candy when I can buy a real watermelon for $5.  I love candy but I'd rather buy a bag of sour patch watermelon slices for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time and I used one Groupon for food and another for the candy shop.  I ordered a Raspberry watermelon mojito goblet.l decorated with candies.  They pour the drink into this huge glass in front of you as you see the \"smoke\" From the ice when the drink is poured.  The drink does do the trick and I got buzzed at 2pm.  It really hits too (the Mojito I had ordered is made with 8 shots of rum.  It does not taste strong but it packs a punch.  The foods is not bad, but if course, it cannot compare to the more unique dining.  My daughters ordered the chicken tenders and he white Chocolate burger which was something different.  We also ordered onion rings and fries.  It would be nice if friends came with the burger but overall fun experience"}
{"text":"Here on vacation had a buy 1get one free ticket for their goblets. Loved them!!!! Are there 3 more times and tried different drinks all amazing even their ice cream drinks. Staff was very friendly no issues at all. Pros: Amazing drinks Discounts offered Friendly staff Large menu selection Clean Fun interior  Plenty of seating  Bus drops off right by it  Cons: Fashion show mall location a bit out of the way from middle or strip"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. It's alot of smoke and no roast. Very loud tourist trap. They spend alot on marketing to make this place popular and it was dead for dinner last night. We had three subpar burgers and three drinks when the bill came I was mortified. FYI there is no prices on the menu for the drinks."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. They don't seem to know what \"reservation\" means. We had a 9pm reservation for 6 people. I showed up early to check in and the staff had no clue where to seat us. After waiting by the hostess stand for 20 minutes, I reminded them that we had a reservation and they acted like I hadn't told them that from the beginning.   We got seated on the outdoor patio, which was quiet compared to the inside. Or at least it was until a DJ started playing right next to our booth. My girlfriend and I ordered chocolate fondue for 2 (which is $28) and it was served COLD. Our friends ordered one of their giant goblet drinks ($36) and it was served in a broken glass.   To top it all off, while we were still eating, our server told us the entire patio was now reserved for a private party and we would have to move inside. Unacceptable. We will never go back. We chose Sugar Factory for my girlfriends birthday dinner and they wouldn't even do anything special for her because of the private party taking over the patio. Avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"Went with my mother while she was visiting me from Ohio. We have never been. I got a burger and she got a pizza burger. The food was so good but there was a lot left over that we took home. We had one if their famous drinks! I believe it was worth it. They are a bit pricey but you only live once!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here it was for my sisters birthday. The inside of the restaurant looks really cool and I loved the decorations. We got seated at a table directly in front of the doors that go into the kitchen. Waiters and hosts came in and out so often that it was a huge distraction. It happened so frequently that it almost seemed like their were way too many people working on a pretty slow afternoon.   We both ordered drinks, which were pretty good, but our food wasn't that special. It was good, but I was expecting something a little more unique from this restaurant.   As we were leaving, at least four hosts and their manager was standing in front of the door and didn't even notice that we were trying to leave. I said \"excuse me\" and the hosts move like it was my own problem. Sorry I'm just trying to exit?    The second time I'm came here was just to get drinks (hoping the service would be better on a saturday night at their bar area). Sadly I was disappointed, again. The drinks were great, but the bar tender was awfully rude.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone other than for the drinks. But even the drinks weren't good enough to make me put up with the bad service."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since I heard it was opening. Brought my girlfriend to it. Ordered a pizza. A salad. And some fries. The food was pretty good and prices weren't ridiculous. Our server Matt was extremely attentive and entertaining!! He definitely made our night! When we entered I wasn't down to try the goblet but he managed to convince me! It was pretty cool  actually. Pros- good food, great service, cool atmosphere. Cons- needs more alcohol in the goblet"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! and that doesn't even begin to explain it.  We went for my son's birthday.  Great host, very personable, no complaints yet.  We ordered a signature drink (virgin) and then we placed our food orders.  The place was not busy.  Over 20 minutes later.....finally came out with the signature drink.  Not really sure why it took that long.  Than after waiting over 45 minutes our food FINALLY came out.  And, of course, it wasn't even close to right.... my son's patty melt... well they ran out of rye bread.  Really?!?  My parents both ordered a tuna melt hold the bread and a side of salad.  Apparently, this was more than what the new cook in the kitchen could handle.  He served ice cold tuna on a bed of lettuce.  I had the turkey and brie sandwich.  I ended up deconstructing it because there was so much seasoned mustard on it I wanted to gag.  Also, brie was ice cold.  Hubby's sandwich was an actual tuna melt.  But it was served, again, ice cold and on rye (so did he get the last two sliced in the restaurant? or did the cook just have no bleeping idea what a patty melt was).  Some of our plates came with fries.  How hard is it to screw up french fries.  Well, the new cook figured it out.  They were obviously initially frozen (not fresh), completely under cooked, served ice cold, and not seasoned at ALL. Next we were informed that since it was my son's birthday, he would receive a free ice cream sundae.  Okay.  I honestly think they must have been milking the cows to make this.  Again....long wait.  It was painful to just sit there at this point.  So, I thought I would run to the ladies room.  YUCKY doesn't even start.  Instead of using their facilities, I instead while filling up with gas used the one at the 7-11 down the street.  Sadly, much better."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that the food was good. My husband and I ordered the rainbow sliders, onion rings and fries. The fries were lightly seasoned, however they were string thin, but also tasty. The sliders were flavorful and filling, as were the onion rings. My friend ordered the macaroni and cheese balls, they give you 3 and she only ate 1, they were not good.  Second, the drinks. The drinks were very yummy with just enough sweet and alcohol combined. I ordered the chocolate strawberry cocktail and my friend ordered the root beer float.  Last I would like to give the reason of only 2 stars. The service. The service was terrible. We sat for nearly 30 min before someone came to take our order. To top it off, our waitress was so eager to get another tables order that she said she'd be back to finish our order after she took the other tables order and then never came back. About 20min later she shows up with a milkshake saying we ordered it, um no, you never came back to finish taking our order. Wrong table.  The entire time we were there not once did she come check to make sure everything was ok or to see if we needed drink refills.  I had to flag her down to get our check, by this time the table was cleared by another person. So will I ever go back, probably not to this location."}
{"text":"Kathy was our server the first time ever and this place was amazing! Were from outta town and the staff was smiling and welcoming and FYI there sexy too!  Alex"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best! Not worth the hype!    Nice ambiance and a fun place to go BUT the food is not appetizing in the least. The grilled chicken is thin, chewy and poorly seasoned.   They were out of ice cream so for dessert my party and I ordered cheesecake, which I must say, is the worth cheesecake I've ever tasted! Plain and tasteless.   Service was extremely slow, although I don't know if the waiter was just bogged down with too many tables.   Overall, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"We had a table of 9. It was so hot in there we were sweating and fanning ourselves. Service was terrible and here is why: 1) We were consistently out of water,  when the server finally decided to stop blaming the runners he brought a barely full pitcher to fill one glass.  Took 20 minutes to come back to fill the rest.  2) Two of us went without silverware for the duration for the meal,  we asked 3x for setups,  had to resort to stealing from another table.  3) THE FOOD... For a place that charges $14-16 for a salad you would expect it to be something you couldn't make at home,  and honestly we make better salads at home. The Chinese chicken salad looks nothing like the pitcure on the menu,  the lettuce was old and the chicken looked boiled, pretty sure it had little to no purple cabbage, it was disappointing.   Overall when you spend close to $80 bucks for two people you expect to leave satisfied. This place should stop serving food and just focus on drinks made with candy because that's it's only strong suit."}
{"text":"Ms. Chelsea A. was a sugar indeed! She accomodated our party of 10 and surely made a great impression on us. Her service was outstanding. Unfortunately one of our sugar goblets didn't have the dry ice because they ran out. But good ol' Chealsea made up for it and her service was just so pleasing, I didn't even care if my goblet didn't have the smoke hovering out of it. It still tasted great and so did the food! I got the Rainbow Sliders, juicy, colorful, basically a real life pretty patty (yeah, I just made a spongebob reference lol.) Our group came in to celebrate two of their birthdays so we also got the BIG bowl of ice cream and candy delivered so happily by all the sugar factory servers. That dessert was also pretty bomb. Enough to feed us all!   Don't forget to check-in on Yelp for the 50% off the sugar goblet (theres also non alcoholic ones!) Also, one of my friends used a groupon here as well so you can check that out too.  I'm so glad they opened a new restaurant here, I was pretty sad when the one at the Paris closed down. But forsure this wont be my last visit!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Lauren is the best! Great service! Love the drinks, most definitely will go for seconds!"}
{"text":"Walked by and saw a real cool drink with smoke coming off of it. Decided to go in and I'm glad I did. Try the white gummi goblet it's delicious!! And the smoke comes from the dry ice at the bottom of the glass, it's a great added feature :)"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food was delicious.. Went for brunch and had bottomless mimosas. The waiter kept the drinks coming without us even having to ask. Will make sure to go again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came for my birthday had the worst experience ever. My meal came uncooked I asked for well done and it was still mooing on the plate. I informed the waitress of this and she took it back. Once my \"new\" came back it had no bacon or blue cheese on A Bacon Blue Burger . My sisters and moms shake were missing ingredients and they did not tell them and however when they asked about it one little saucer was brought with them on it. What a waste of time and money. This place is wayyy over rated and not worth my time. Should have gone next door to Benihana."}
{"text":"Went to the Sugar Factory to check it out.  My husband had a coupon for the lollipop which was but one get one free. I picked up the apple flavored lollipop. The lady was explaining us how it worked. There's a cap that covers the lollipop if you can't finish it. Once you finish the lollipop, you discard the stick and replace it with another one. You can order the lollipops on line. Great idea. The whole lollipop contraption was a little pricey if you ask me. It was about $25.00 a pop. The other one was free. The store was very bright and colorful and had lots of different kinds of candy especially the old school candy.  I don't think I would want to spend that much money on candy in the store. You can buy it elsewhere for cheaper.  Store was clean and was easy to find what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Wow. What a mistake it was coming in here. I ignored all the warning signs and let my friends convince me to give this place a try. We were walking around looking for a place to eat lunch, and..  Warning Sign 1.. They have hype guys standing outside trying to get people to come in. They flash the menu and try to convince you they have amazing foods/drinks. We were kinda hesitant. But then he mentions a 2-for-1 appetizer deal. My friends were all about that, and I was out voted. So we went in. I had a bad feeling by that time. If you ever walk by a strip club that has hype guys outside, it's a clear sign the talent inside ain't so great. Same concept here with a restaurant. Read on.  Warning Sign 2.. We were seated. I flipped through the menu and noticed that the cocktails were very prominent, with lots of large and colorful pictures. The food.. not so much. They're listed in the back part of the menu. Hardly any pictures. Just generic descriptions and tourist prices. Also, we asked about the 2-for-1 appetizer deal. Our waiter kindly informs us that it's only valid if you buy a cocktail. Something the hype man outside neglected to tell us.  Warning Sign 3.. We were ready to order. Our waiter came over and tried to punch in our order on his handheld thing. But it wasn't working. He went off to grab another one and came back about 10 minutes later. But that one didn't work either. So he wrote down our order with pencil and pad. Lol.   Warning Sign 4.. Food took forever. The place was practically empty. So I'm not sure what the delay was. Maybe the staff was on their lunch break, eating at another restaurant?  And we finally got our food. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich. Oh boy, what I actually got was a big plate of disappointment. I could tell it was microwaved or precooked. Even though it was covered in buffalo/wing sauce, the breading looked obviously soggy as if it was sitting around for a while. Also, the menu says it was supposed to be on a brioche bun. It was served on plain old wheat bread like you get from the supermarket. And I really knew it wasn't fresh cooked because when I bit into it, it was warm. Not steaming hot like normal fried chicken sandwiches. The fries were the only thing that was good.   So after my underwhelming dining experience, I came to the conclusion that this is a bar masquerading as a restaurant. Based on the enormous and somewhat comically fruity drinks and desserts, the target demographic for this place is for 20-30 year old girls, for a \"girls night out\" type of thing. If you want real food, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I mean what can i say!! I am a frequent visitor. This location I used Group Deal here in Vegas and it was perfect! Unlimited mimosas!"}
{"text":"I only wanted to come here to try the huge goblet drink and I was pretty sure it was going to be overrated and disappointing but instead I turned out to really like it! The staff was very friendly, even though our waitress was incredibly busy she took good care of us and checked in frequently. We ordered the raspberry watermelon mojito. The only complain I have about this drink is that it became carbonated because of the dry ice and I didn't really think that worked with the flavors (but that is just a personal preference). We also ordered the \"chocolate, chocolate, chocolate crepe\" and it was really good too, but you honestly can't go wrong with chocolate really. Yes, the price is a little bit high maybe but it's a fun restaurant to go to and they have a lot of different types of desserts and drinks. I would of come here for a regular dinner, rather would just recommend it for drinks and desserts!"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the GroupOn offer, we would have never visited this place. With a GroupOn, we got $40 worth of food for $25 as long as we go Mon. To Fri. It's around $4-$5 more for any day (includes Fri-Sun) GroupOn. We arrived in town on Thursday so we had dinner there on our first night.   We got seated right away since, I guess, Mon. To Thurs. is not a busy night. As soon as we were seated, I regret our decision. As a family, we like to look at the menu and talk about our choices but I could barely say a word without screaming because the music was so loud!!!!!! I guess they don't want you to talk to anyone you are with and have a nice conversation over food.  The next regret came when we saw the prices on the menu. With the $40 GroupOn we got one order of $20 rainbow sliders, 5 tiny pieces so it comes out to $4 each where you get two bites each out of it. We also got one order of $19 shake which came with a bonus tiny slider.  I was going to check in to Yelp to get 50 percent off one of the smoking goblet but I was told that I cannot combine it with the GroupOn. Lucky break that I realized later on since I would rather spend my money elsewhere.   The worst part was being seated next to the elevator where all night long scantily dressed women were brought up there by the wait staff. That must be their free ticket to get up there. There's not that much space in between the elevator and our table so it's a bit distracting. The elevator is also close to another room where the wait staff keeps going in and out. This must be how it felt like to be seated next to the restroom.   This place is just hyped up by the Kardashian family and other celebrities. We go to Vegas at least once a year and this is definitely one of those one time visit only."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and check this out. So finally we were able to come and dine here with a friend. First I thought I can use the Groupon but then they say I can't use it bec I have to have 4 people to be able to use it. So I wasn't able to use it and that's a bummer .   Then I checked out the store . Ok so what is the difference between this store compared to the other candy stores ? Actually it's only the name and the plastic goblet that says sugar factory and that's it . All of the candies here u may find it in any candy store . They don't have any signature candy or chocolate like See's candies or ghirardelli So anyways I still got myself some chocolate covered gummy and nuts .        On to our dining experience , the decor of the restaurant is ok nothing really fancy. Since it's a sugar factory I would expect more sugar decor lol . But it's just an ordinary restaurant type of decor . We got the orders right away and my kid ordered the berry bliss and it was really great to experience it . Me and  my friend ordered fettuccine . So the food came , my kid was delighted to see the smokey berry bliss . My guess is that they put dry ice on the bottom , add some berries and then when it's time to serve , the server pour the cocktail (without the alcohol) to the big goblet and then it starts to smoke . Pretty neat. Then the lunch was served , my son ordered the chicken with waffle . It's a big serving but the taste is not that great the chicken is salty. The waffles didn't come with any fruit or whip cream . And IHOP waffles tasted better than this one . Onto our fettuccine oh my gosh it is way salty to my taste oh my goodness what's wrong with me everything I taste always taste salty . But how come the other pasta restaurant doesn't taste salty at all ?         So at least I got a great talk with my long time friend who's based from Vegas . Then I got the bill . The berry bliss in the goblet was $30 so I thought maybe the goblet is free that we can bring it home . But no . The price is  $30 it's only great to experience it . So that's another bummer and so I have to buy it from the store if I want and it cost $20 . Well that's it I cannot say I fully recommend it . If u want to experience it why not go ahead but be aware ur paying way too much . I wouldn't recommend to eat the salty foods that you may order anywhere else but I would recommend the goblet if you want to experience it ."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed drinks at the Sugar Factory located at the Las Vegas Fashion Mall. He had the Hypnotic goblet and it had gummy sharks inside. I had their signature goblet with a candy necklace and two unicorn lollipops. They both were super delicious! I only wish we hadn't just had dinner because I would have loved trying something from their dinner menu. Service was a little slow, but we were in no rush. The decor inside  is pretty cool, but we chose to drink outside. We can't wait to go back and try their food and enjoy their chocolate lounge."}
{"text":"WOW. This place doesn't seem like anything till you get inside and order your food. I suggest getting coupons from the people outside for the food and goblet drinks. My fiancé and I ordered the goblet drinks with the coupon that said 2 for 1. We saved a lot of money because the goblet cost about $36? The experience is amazing though. You see everyone recording when they get the drinks. Yummy candies inside and one drink does you good! The desserts are amazing as well, but if you come for food, I'm not sure how much you can eat the dessert! The food comes in good quantity. The spinach and artichoke dip was my favorite appetizer along with the chicken wings. Shoutout to the waiter Chase, who was really kind and gave the best serve in Las Vegas to us! Definitely recommend this place. It is a rememberable treat ;)"}
{"text":"No different than any other sugar factory expect it's smaller than the NY location. I've been to the sugar factory a dozen times so I know the drill get a drink and a burger you won't go wrong with a burger."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time tonight at Sugar Factory by myself because I was craving for French toast after holiday shopping! I got seated right away by a host at the bar area which is nice! I waited for 10 mins for the bartender to come ask me what I want to drink! Then took her another 10 mins to get to me to order food! Another 30 mins for my French toast to get on my table! For the whole time the bartender (a girl) was so pay attention on her VIP people (from their drunk conversation, the people are maybe owner's friends). She has no intention of greeting other customers on her bar zone! And very unorganized environment at the bar! The bar back has to keep on asking her where everything is, and as a bartender herself went back and forth 4 times to find a bottle of syrup. Then another bartender broke a glass! Everything was not a nice experience! I think the bartender is a nice girl, but very slow and has no muti-tasking skills and not acknowledge of her surroundings! For my 50 mins in this sugar factory, the bartender only talked to me twice, beginning and the end for the check! Never apologize on the delay of my food!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Sugar Factory so I wanted to check it out I know they are pretty famous for the drinks but I wanted to try the food I seen a pretty picture of Chicken Alfredo on the menu with what looked like cheese bread when I received my order the Alfredo was submerged in oil the bread was not only stale it was cold and hard the manager gave me more bread that looked similar to the one on the menu and it was also stale I had finally had enough and the second bite of Alfredo made me sick my waitress was very nice and offered to take my meal off the bill and comp me for any drink I wanted however the very rude manager tried to intervene and offer me a burger or desert instead I politely declined I was over it he was upset that my waitress offered a drink of my choice and after pretty much causing a scene he rudely said to order a drink and that his waitress had no right to comp me for my meal which may be true but he should have chose s more professional way to handle the situation the drink was pretty good but I'd recommend not eating at this place"}
{"text":"Wonderful! The staff was beyond friendly and the food was great! The presentation alone makes you want to try everything on the menu. Reasonably priced and in a central location.... I fell in love"}
{"text":"Sugar Factory is known for its goblets and rainbow sliders. I would give it 5 stars, but the reason why I'm only giving it 4 stars is because they were out of rainbow sliders. How can you be out of rainbow sliders at like 12pm?! On the plus side, The \"Lollipop Passion\" goblet was yummy! I wish I could try all of them, but those things are ginormous!!"}
{"text":"Sugar factory was great! Our waitress Nessa was so sweet!!! A great Las Vegas experience everyone should enjoy!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had an amazing  and exquisite experience tonight. We were greeted before we even reached the entrance. A lovely hostess reached out to invite us in unaware that we had reservations. Reservation indeed, it was a full house and I know why! The music gave the vibe a fun happy atmosphere. We started with the delicious Bruschetta & I ordered the Rib Eye dinner and she ordered the Steak Frites. Both of our steaks came out exactly how we ordered them, \"medium rare\" it' was perfect. \"Our compliments to the Chef\" we told our sweet and attentive waitress Adrien. We had the pleasure of meeting 2 restaurant managers and yes they are involved and seemingly never fail to check on any and all of us patrons.  The rest of the staff we came in contact with were attentive and a pleasure to meet. We finished it of with the Turtle Cheese cake, oh WOW, a must have!!!  Upon our farewell we personally expressed our compliments and gratitude to the gentleman named Mike (1 of the 2 managers we met) and Adrien our server. Not realizing there was an upstairs Mike personally took us on an upstairs tour of the rest of this Amazing Candy Land where there were having ladies night every Thursday's (btw). Crazy exotic drinks of all kinds some with chocolate dipped glass rims, a strawberry fondu fountain to cotton candy and so much more. She'll be back with her girlfriends for ladies night and we'll be back for more exquisite food and fun! Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty sweeeet time here at the Sugar Factory! To start off, Ms. Mercedes, our hostess, was such an incredible host and helped make our time there really extraordinary. I wish I could remember the name of my waitress because she also deserves all of the praise I can give. The Sugar Factory is one stop in Vegas that I recommend everyone makes.  I loved the location of this place, in the heart of the strip. It was alive and full of fun people and all of the staff was very welcoming and professional. You can also take your drink to walk around if you haven't finished it during your stay (which, unfortunately, I finished mine).  Which brings me right to the drinks. I had the \"Energy Bear Goblet\". Now I'm not really a sweets person, but this was a special occasion so I decided to bite the bullet. This was so fantastic. From presentation to taste, this was a very quality drink.   I also had the buffalo chicken sandwich and if everyone isn't ordering this, they're really doing themselves dirty. A fantastically cooked chicken with a delicious sauce and awesome toppings. So good, there was no way I could finish this and a goblet.  And if I haven't raved about the staff enough (I haven't), the service was impeccable. From the entrance to service to everything. It was a friend's birthday and Mercedes would not let her get out of the birthday dessert and song. Which was fun, and made us feel very warm and welcome.  Overall, fantastic choice for a place to celebrate. 5/5 service, 5/5 food, 5/5 location."}
{"text":"If you are going to splurge this is the place. The drinks and food are fabulous. Great customer service is beyond great. I strongly recommend you try one of the drinks and a milkshake, the hardest part is deciding which one to try."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the food was great. More on the pricier side but there are some groupons at times. Definitely recommend getting a giant milkshake as mine was delicious. Still can't believe I finished it all myself."}
{"text":"I'm actually sitting here writing this as we wait for our server to remember we exist so we can pay and leave. We had to wait a long time for our server to come to our table to ask for drink refills, order food, and pay the bill. Gratuity (18%) was included which is some bullshit because while our server was nice and polite, many things went wrong this meal and he was not attentive. If the restaurant had been full, I would understand but it was nearly empty. The Pepsi I ordered (they didn't have coke)  was one of the most disgusting things I've ever tasted. Something has to be very wrong with their soda machine. I ordered the Chinese chicken salad which wasn't horrible, but wasn't flavorful or fresh and the chicken wasn't quality. The fries were cold (they brought us a hot serving after we complained). The water tasted weird, I think it might've been something wrong with the ice. Also there were no paper towels or hand dryer or any way to dry your hands in the bathroom. For the price this place isn't worth it at all."}
{"text":"When we came here a month ago, we were not happy with our experience with the service. We decided to give Sugar Factory another chance and really enjoyed it this time. The service was excellent and prompt. The experience is so fun seeing all the fun drink concoctions go by and overall it was a festive experience. The food was pretty good too."}
{"text":"The service here is great. Everything we've eaten here was very tasty. The goblet drinks are massive and easily split by 2. Hit them up during their amazing happy hour to at least to save on ur drinks.  Check in via Yelp and get 50% off drinks...NICE!"}
{"text":"The hubs made us come here.  We ordered a choco fondue.  Totally over priced for the food we got but what isn't in Vegas?  Nicely decorated.  The kids had fun dipping their delectables in gooey chocolate so the overall experience was fun."}
{"text":"This is ridiculous, the place is empty and I can't get a table to eat desert, I need to order at least appetizers. I was honest to say I want I have a desert, hosted was unbelievable rude."}
{"text":"Update: we went back last night for dinner with the family and this time the experience was wonderful. Nicki our waitress was very attentive to our table. The food was delicious and this time the goblet we ordered had the right amount of liquor and didn't taste like just juice. Thank you for making our second time here a better one.  My group and I went here yesterday for our ladies night I was excited to go here since it was my first time and I had seen before that they have these cool drinks to chose from. When we got here we waited almost an hour maybe more to get seated which they kept giving us the run around. When we did get seated we were put in the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen, to be honest I think that table was pulled from outside and placed wherever since our group was becoming impatient from waiting for an hour they figure they just put us anywhere. When our waiter came to the table we ordered a watermelon goblet he said he would bring waters which we didn't get till 30 min later. For the price of that drink I would think it would have enough liquor but it tasted like juice instead. We pretty much didn't see our waiter since he was more concerned about a bigger party that he was taking care of. When he did come to the table we ordered another goblet, we sat and waited for almost 35 min and still no drink, by this time we were already disappointed with the service that the first waitress I saw I asked her to find our waiter and ask him to bring us the check. From the time we got in to the time we got our check we were in this restaurant for over 3 hrs 1/2! Super disappointed from this experience."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!  Drinks were so creative and the food was great.   I really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and even though it was winter when I went there, the outside is a must.  People were sitting outside even in the cold.  I can't wait to go back in the spring!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times & I can't believe this place is still open. It's always empty & the food is horrible. The service was better than the last time but it doesn't make up for the terrible food. Husband and I had dinner at bonefish grill so we decided to have dessert here. We ordered the classic sundae. The ice cream scoops were huge but it wasn't any special ice cream, it was store bought commercial. The toppings were barely drizzled on & I didn't even realize there were sprinkles because there barely was any. I'm done coming here & I won't be surprised if they close anytime soon."}
{"text":"To my girls thanks for letting me redeem midnight birthdaycake!   A tradition I call, it's not midnight birthday cake anymore!   What's on the table? The watermelon gobblett  The King Kong  Philly cheeseburger  White chocolate burger Chicken and waffles Chicken Alfredo pasta  I highly recommend the following:   This establishment is known for it's gobblett drinks, virgin or with alcohol. Either way the taste is a burst of energy. It's an item on the menu that comes in different ways, a must try on your first experience. The gobblett is sharable so the price fits the portion, $35.00 bucks.   If you want to put a smile on mine or my girl's faces gimme some ice cream 16 flavors of them with sparkles! The King Kong is presented with all the glitter and glam and is announced with importance! The whole restaurant is dimmed for the King Kong has arrived! All eyes on the King Kong as the sparkles light the way to your table. I tried the coffee, mango sherbet,  and blue bubblegum. The ice cream is lit! The presentation and the taste match its price, $80 bucks.  I left entertained and satisfied!"}
{"text":"My first experience at \"Sugar Factory\" was the one at Paris Hotel! Remembered great service and good food!  My visit this time was because of a Groupon deal - $30 for $62 worth of dinner/drinks.  We made reservations but was running a little late. When I came up to the hostess and told her that, she pretty much just threw me at the worst possible seat outside. My mistake for assuming that I should've been asked if I wanted indoors or outdoors, or if I wanted to wait for indoor seats.   Took about 10 mins for us to see our waiter, Justin. He took our water order, for we were waiting for our friend, and told us about their half-off special for the night on drinks. Took another 10-15 mins to ACTUALLY get our water.   Because we were waiting for our friend still, we decided to order a couple things - we got a $29 White Gummi Goblet, my $18 3-Piece Chicken Fingers and Onion Rings and my friend's $8 4-Piece, Cracker-Sized Bruschetta.  Our goblet arrives.. As they're suppose to, they bring the cup filled with ice and they poor the drink in front of you. Justin pours the drink .. Then DEMANDS for my friend to sip it because it was going to over flow.. Like DEMANDED, as in told her \"hurry up, sip it because it's going to spill all over the table\" ... W T F?!  Our food comes shortly after the uncomfortable incident, it was good and all but just not worth what we paid for..  We had ordered another goblet (Berry Bliss) and for what they're worth, they are definitely good drinks. Although they were sweet and fruity, they pack the alcohol punch that comes creepin' after a while of drinking it!  Somewhere along that time period Justin had made really awkward, not so funny jokes.. It made us feel so uncomfortable and he did it in no flirty, nor professional manner!  As closing time approaches, Justin had asked for my phone for the Groupon voucher, he took it so our discount can be applied to the bill. He came back, dropped the check, and literally ran off ..  Sooooo, where's my phone?!?!? Seriously took a few minutes to see him.. When he finally noticed I was eyeing him down, I asked \"so where's my phone?!\". He ran towards his manager, dropped off my phone and AGAIN awkwardly, unprofessionally joked about his manager looking through my pictures.. True or not, I shouldn't have had to ask for my phone! Nor did he have to make that stupid joke!  I've seriously have had it with him that night and wonder how and why he works there.  To end the night, we saw on our bill that gratuity was included... For THREE people ?!? Because we had our Groupon deal??? I honestly didn't understand but I would've really liked for our \"funny\" waiter, Justin, to have explained things..  For the record, I don't think I'd be coming back ... If I do ..... Nvm yeah def not, thanks to Justin!"}
{"text":"Scott the bartender and or server is great. Free shots and amazing drinks and food. If you're visiting or a local it's a definite must visit! I would recommend it to everyone I know!"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the WORST SERVICE I've had. I'm local. I myself work in the casino restaurant industry and my bf is a chef on the strip. So we very much we'll know hospitality.  We sat upstairs and we were greeted by the waitress. When I told her we needed a second before ordering drinks, she never once came back.  We waited what felt like 20mins until I had to get up and ask a bartender if he could send someone to get our drinks and that we were ready to order.  The manager than comes to take our order and you would think he would be apologetic after I had to wait and ask for service but no.. didn't bother him .. We ordered our food and drinks.  We waited no lie 30mins for sliders and a burger philly. The manager did however come by and said \"it shouldn't be much longer\" .. which really means .. \"it's still going to be awhile\"  There was only two waitress it wasn't busy for a Saturday night (11/4/17)they both had large parties of 10 and 15 no other tables just those two parties. If you can't handle a table of 2 let you're manager know ..  The waitresses looked confused and didn't know who's meals was who's when the large parties food came out, they were auctioning food.  Our food came out and my bf asked for  medium well burger and it wasn't. My rainbow sliders were not bad.  The busser did come by and asked how we were doing and refilled our drinks which I very much appreciated it.  The manager also than came by later to ask how was everything.  When we were done we waited another 15mins to see if anyone would come by. No one came, I easily could had walked out the restaurant without paying because no one attending us.  I AGAIN HAD TO GET UP AND ASK FOR MY BILL!!  My bf and I don't ever complain or make smart mouth remarks or ever call a manager. We're respectful and we try giving the benefit of the doubt. But this was one of the worst service we've had. So bad I had to make my first yelp review.  Sugar factory's hospitality sucks to the max and their management was just as bad .."}
{"text":"Before I had lived in the Vegas area, I had dined at their other location on the strip.  I loved it there so I was keeping my fingers crossed with this new location.  And my superstitious finger crossing worked!  I was so excited to try them so we popped in for lunch.  It wasn't overly busy which makes me happy i don't have to wait in line.  We were seated immediately with Brandon, our waiter, over in a flash.  They have a wide range of menu items.  Luckily on Monday's their appetizers, burgers and pizza are half price ALL DAY!  Big smiles all around!  So of course I went with the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger but started off with their onion rings appetizer.    The onion rings were absolutely perfect.  Crispy and light breading hugged the ever so tasty onion.  A heavenly chipotle ranch dipping sauce accompanied the appetizer which had just enough kick to keep my taste buds popping!  Can you tell I loved them?  But wait, I'm not done....  Still happy about my burger being half price, I was anxiously waiting to devour it.  I always order my burger medium so it has just enough pink.  And the judges give it a 10!  It was perfectly cooked.  Not to mention the crispy bacon, onion straws and sautéed mushrooms sitting pretty on the burger.  I would order that again and again.    Our food was obviously great, and so was the service!  Brandon was the definition of great service.  He was delightfully pleasant and attentive for our entire dining experience.  Thank you Sugar Factory for not letting me down!"}
{"text":"We met up here with a few co workers and friends on a Friday night. Although we did not have a reservation, our request for a table was quickly accommodated.   Our drink orders were placed and brought out in a timely manner. One of the members of our party ordered the gummy bear goblet. It looked delicious and she enjoyed it -- I could only admire it from afar. The goblets are typically $29, but during their happy hour special it was 50% off. I think the special was a great equalizer because as interesting as it looked, I would not have dropped $29 on it.   I did not opt for any sweets this time, but my husband and I decided to share their turkey burger with a side of fries. It looked, and tasted, extremely disappointing. It was a deflated sandwich with some bland turkey, costco buns and mushrooms for $16. It took the two of us 30 minutes to finish it, in between socializing with our party. Had it been great we would have wolfed that thing down in 10 minutes or less. The rest of our party kept ordering drinks and got to take advantage of the great happy hour special that was going on. Our waiter was very attentive and accommodating. He earns most of the stars. The food and regularly priced drinks were extremely over priced. A small bag of candy (and I mean SMALL) was $4.  It does appear to be a  popular spot for birthday celebrations for high schoolers. You'd know someone was celebrating their birthday when 50 cent's In Da Club would start blasting and there would be staff carrying dessert with sparklers to the table.   Perhaps the birthday niche is the one that works and they should stick to the desserts and maybe go tapas style vs doing substandard burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, etc. It is amazing to me how many people loved taking pictures in front of jars of candy. It made for great people watching."}
{"text":"Had a ton of fun with Brittany as our server.   A little bit of something for everyone"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and quick. Food was delicious. Drinks were out of this world. The milkshake was fab"}
{"text":"Came back tonight and what a difference.  Bryan (manager) came over to meet me personally and introduced himself. He went out of his way to make sure that my sons birthday dinner went flawless. Food was great, quick and our waitress was very attentive. Bryan also made sure to bring out the biggest ice cream surprise I've ever seen. My son had the best time as well as the rest of my family.  So glad we gave this another try. Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I've been to Sugar Factory twice now and I think that if you're coming here for breakfast, go for something sweet and not savory. Sugar Factory does much better with their drinks and sweet dishes for breakfast.  The first time I came here, it was around breakfast time. I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile and had some free time to do so. I ordered an omelette with vegetables in it as well as some Nutella chocolate chip pancakes because I wanted to be healthy and also have pancakes. The waitress serving me didn't pay much attention to me which was a little meh since she spent far more time focusing on the tables next to me.  When I got my food, it came separately and the guy who brought it out seemed confused. My omelette plate looked a little messy. I tasted it and it was just okay. Actually, less than okay because for that price, I expected taste. The pancake was far tastier.  The second time I came here, I came with my sister for another breakfast occasion. This time I ordered smores crepes and a cotton candy Cosmo while she ordered her own crepes and a shake. The Cosmo tasted just like cotton candy and it was so delicious to drink. I noticed the cotton candy on one end of the straw, but I never noticed the gummy bear at the bottom of the straw until towards the very end. I told my sister that \"That's the drunkest gummy bear ever.\" The crepes were so good that I ate that bad boy right up.  The service was much better the second time around and I'm glad I went with a sweet breakfast dish. The next time I come here, I'll stick to their sweet breakfast dishes, drinks, and I definitely want to try their desserts. I'm not that interested in trying out their burgers when I can get burgers anywhere else and for cheaper."}
{"text":"I purchased the Groupon for 2 people (40 dollars worth credit Mon- thursday)   1 goblet is 40.00 with alcohol and 36.00 without (what the heck?!?)   We ended up not drinking and ordered:  1. rainbow sliders (comes with a free mini duck)- the flavor was on point and the colors were def IG friendly. I loved it! The burgers had a lot of flavor and the right amount of filling to meat to bread ratio.  2. Calamari- keep in mind it is like tempura style (fluffy and airy- slightly seasoned) I really enjoyed the calamari because it seemed not as greasy *please note they do not have tarter sauce and have marinara   For dessert we got the cookie jar sundae (meant for 2 people)- it was massive there were 4 of us and we barley made a dent. The ice cream is from San Francisco and absolutely delicious.   I will be back with another Groupon to try more but it is really pricey. They have special events- new years and superbowl which is 100.00 a person and includes food and goblets for free. I will do that in the future for sure!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time there and the service was great it was a bit expensive but It seems like everything is expensive here in Vegas so you have to stop looking at the price And just Enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet this new place here at Town Square!  It's just not the candy store but also a full service restaurant and bar.    Making this review short since I'm just putting it on blast via my phone so just the highlights for now.  Dining area indoors has mixture of booths table and seating at bar.  Outdoors has nice heat lamps and also flat screen TVs are out here too.   It's American fare cuisine.  Burgers, salads, dessert pancakes and waffles, savory and sweet crepes. Portions are average.  Prices are in line with restaurants here at Town Square.  Deep fried Macaroni n Chesse pops apps,  chicken fingers, red velvet pancakes, dessert waffles dish, Red Velvet Martini and grown up version of a Root Beer float was our picks.. All were great!  Didn't have room for dessert though.   Service from the time we stepped foot and left the place was EXELLENT!  All their servers are well trained. Everyone friendly and helpful.   There's a small section of the restaurant that is dedicated to sweets included their signature Couture Pops. The Hello Kitty one has a charm!    Sugar Factory American Brasserie is going to give the place across the way a run for their money. Especially the Happy Hour 3-6pm time frame. Martinis and specialty drinks are also on their Happy Hour menu which also consists of 1/2 off burgers and appetizers..  AND.. Happy Hour is ALL DAY on Monday!!!  How freaking A AWESOME!!! .. I'm there!"}
{"text":"Enjoined my visit with the family. The waiter was really nice and the drinks were really good. It was nice to bring the kids and let them order drinks (non-alcoholic) and the prices are fair. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Everything was wonderful. Chaz is an excellent server. He recommended great dishes and his smile was gorgeous. I am still dreaming of WHITE CHOCOLATE. It does not always have to be chocolate!!!"}
{"text":"Great drinks and deserts, food is ok, could be better, especially the ribeye.  Service could use some help as well."}
{"text":"This Sugar Factory location doesn't exist anymore it is now a HEX chocolate store, I'm assuming that it's the store that the Sugar Factories are turning into because they are still selling a few of the lolly pops.  The only true store I could find on the Strip was inside the mall at PlanetHollywood. Still love their Fishbowl drinks!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a mostly touristy spot, but fun place to grab dessert BUT only dessert. I'ved lived in Vegas most my life and theyve changed location about 5 times but looks like it will stay at fashion show.  Prices are steeeeep. A goblet with alcohol is $40 and we could not even taste a hint of vodka in ours. My friend said her crepe was good and my $17 burger and fries were just average. Her crepe was pretty small and I actually think more expensive than my burger at $18. Service was friendly and fast. Again, come here purely for their milkshakes and desserts. Goblets are tasty but only worth it if you want a nice Instagram picture."}
{"text":"Great staff. I recommend the gelato, specifically the PB and J. The tipsy truffles were good but they didn't have all the flavors available. Chocolate chip cookie had a ton of chocolate which I like. Pretty good snickerdoodles, not great. Good people watching site."}
{"text":"Wow! Made a reservation for my daughters 14th birthday and they exceeded expectation!   The reservation process was seamless.  Service was top notch.  Garner was awesome! So pleasant and attentive.  Food was delicious!   And to top it off, they did something so special for my daughter!   Highly recommended and we will always come back every time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Went after the Canelo-Chavez Jr. Right about the time they were closing but they still took us in. 1pt.    Location: by the fashion mall district.    Drinks: we had the original goblet and the one with oranges ( candy gummies) I think. Drinks were special, it's something you have to try in Vegas. 1pt   Food: I ordered a rib eye and she ordered mahi mahi tacos. The rib eye was very good and tender well cooked how I wanted it \"medium\" the sides were nothing out of the ordinary but were well prepared. 1pt    Service: waiter was a guy named Jason, that's the guy to go to! He's the man! I highly recommend requesting him. He helped us thorough the menu talked to us about the origin of the place and the popular items on the menu. He even went to the bar to make us his favorite drinks. Not usual for a waiter to also make your drinks 2pts.    Overall 5 stars, well come back again."}
{"text":"I felt quite welcome at 2 in the afternoon for lunch alone and enjoyed chatting with the friendly waiter.  It was quiet, because at that hour it was almost empty, as expected. I enjoyed the steak au poivre, which was not quite traditional, but OMG the mashed potatoes were right up there with the best I've ever had. And I've had Michel Richard's, which he cheerfully admits are 50% butter. With all the candy around it might be a good birthday spot for kids as well. The potatoes were a memorable indulgence, so alcohol or dessert were not required. Thank you for the Groupon, Sugar Factory."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Tuna salad consisted of a can of chunk light dumped on iceberg lettuce...no mayo, dressing, seasoning or anything else. My friend had the wedge salad and the blue cheese dressing was almost nonexistent and watery. And the place is hot!!! Almost no relief from the 100 degree weather outside. No cell service or wifi. My friend liked the cheese cake. Thank goodness!!"}
{"text":"Holy amazing. It's that how they said it in the Bible? Who know but wow what a great time I had at Sugar Factory in Town Square.   I was worth my brother and two friends and wanted to take my brother off the Strip for a little bit to celebrate his birthday. I was at Sugar Factory two years ago, but the one on the Strip.   So the cab takes us there and the four of us sat at the bar. This place is like Candyland the adult version.   The menu is full of burgers, pizza, dessert, and a list of alcoholic concoctions such as FlufferNutter martini, Root Beer Float, and Jolly Rancher martini. Dry ice Mai Tais that snow like a volcano. And the drinks are good. Not too strong or too weak, but taste so good that if you're not careful, you will be drunk lol.   The bartender we had was Lizzy... She made the experience even better. Totally amazing, ask for her by name of you want.   If it's your birthday, they will dim the lights and play cool music, and bring our an ice cream dessert with a rocket on top!   So fun, this will be a permanent stop on my annual Las Vegas adventures!"}
{"text":"Came into Sugar Factory yet again and were blown away with the food and customer service. Our server Anthony was top notch and made our experience unforgettable. This time we had the white gummy and the energy bear goblets. Both were great but I still think the passion punch is my favorite! We started off with the popcorn shrimp and macaroni and cheese pops for an appetizer and but of them suited my satisfaction. For dinner I had the New York strip with a side of grilled asparagus. Despite my steak being a bit overcooked the flavor was still fantastic!   Once again I will for sure be coming to this spot over and over again and will be asking for Anthony as he was professional and took great care of us!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food was good, though the prices were high even compared to other places on the Strip. The main reason to go here is for people who are interested in their large selection of deserts and sweet drinks."}
{"text":"This review is soley on the fact that the time is wrong!!! They close the kitchen at 10pm . And it shows that its open till 12am??? Wtf???? So pissed of that i drove 30 min for them to tell me this!!!!   So dont waste ur time coming here late!  So dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Our server was sick and therefore didn't have much of a personality but that was understandable I guess. We came on a Saturday afternoon and got seated right away. For a party of 6 that's great. The fancy drinks are a little over priced for what you get but nothing beats their presentation. I got the salmon croissant- super good. and the watermelon mojito was a perfect combo of sweet and minty. Loved our visit"}
{"text":"I should have wrote this review back in May when I went for my birthday. After reading everyone's reviews I feel I need to speak up. I use to go to the Sugar Factory at the Paris for years! It was amazing, never had a problem. When they closed I was Devastated. I was excited when they open a new at Fashion Show. I decided to go for my birthday, we went on Saturday, May 13th, I called and made a reservation. We went to the chocolate lounge because I was excited for their menu compared to down stairs menu. Every time I passed by when shopping at fashion show I would look at their menu board outside. I was so excited!  Well we get there and they don't even have the menu available. Strike 1. The place was completely empty. (Red flag) we were the only customer for a long time.  We order, it takes an hour for our drinks and food. Food was cold. It was the menu from downstairs. We were the only people there. I was trying not to cry. My friends had asked for sugar factory to do something special for my birthday (I didn't know). Which ended up having us sit there for an extra 30 mins-1 hour for 2 scoops for vanilla ice cream with sparklers. Apparently they had forgot and then changed us when they said they were comping it. And then over changed my cousin $20 on a $40 bill ($60) and they denied over charging her. And she had to dispute the transaction with her bank. She also had a $7 ice tea that tasted like fish, it was disgusting!  We all ended up getting food poisoning. My birthday was ruined. I tried to stay positive but after we left I started balling my eyes out. I will never go back to Sugar Factory. It's nothing like how it was at the Paris.   The manager on duty said he was going to take care of us for my birthday, but didn't do anything.   Over priced. Horrible food. Long wait. Food poisoning.   You can't pay me to go back there. Thanks for ruining my birthday."}
{"text":"Took 27 minutes, from the time of ordering, to get our glasses of water... despite us asking a couple more times.  Also, charged me $10 for birthday ice cream. I told the waitress that it was my girlfriend's birthday, but she never told me of any costs involved with what I was hoping was a complimentary birthday snack (source -- http://birthdayfreebies.com/freebie/SugarFactoryLasVegasNV)."}
{"text":"This location is worth driving off the strip for. Great happy hour and our server (Darla) was amazing! We had a bunch of teenagers with us and coming from the service industry, I know how frustrating a bunch of teenagers can be to serve. Good food, great drinks and awesome service."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to go to the sugar factory and of course it's EVERYTHING I imagined! We ordered a goblet (of course) and it was well worth the $40 not as sweet as it looks very strong and fun to look at...the children ordered a milkshake that was just as delicious and the staff was very friendly I would highly recommend to friends family and fellow yelpers"}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday with a Sunday brunch at the newest Sugar Factory location at Town Square.  From the moment I walked up to the host stand outside, I was treated like a king!  The table I'd reserved was ready and waiting and we were seated promptly.  Our server, Josh, truly made the experience incredible.  He was attentive to every detail of our meal and went above and beyond to make the day really special. The bartender, Kaylie (sorry if that's misspelled!) whipped up a HUGE variety of mimosas and Bloody Marys for the table and even came by to personally make sure we were enjoying some of her signature creations!  Very nice touch!  The food was awesome and I heard compliments from everyone at the table that they truly enjoyed the dining experience.  The management capped the meal off with a huge birthday sundae surprise, too!  Completely unexpected and VERY delicious!  I couldn't have asked for a better celebration!  THANK YOU SUGAR FACTORY!!!"}
{"text":"Passion punch.... I loved the kick of the alcohol but not tasting it in the drink. The only suggestion i have is make the oranges blood oranges and use colorful straws. Other than that, I love the outdoor option here and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday for lunch because Brio was closed.... Needless to say I will never return unless it's for desert. I ordered the party melt and it was terrible. The bread was twice the size as the burger and for $20 I could have made 8 of them at my house that would have been much better. The service was no better. I got my food before my drinks and then when I asked for a side of ketchup I was finished eating before I got it. The deserts are great but would never recommend anyone to go here for food."}
{"text":"Have this place a second chance and I am so glad we did!! Our waiter RIchard was great. He greeted us quickly and explained a bit of the menu and got our drinks within 5 minutes of being seated. We both ordered the steak classique that comes with fries and a side salad. Our steaks were ordered medium and they were cooked perfectly!!"}
{"text":"Cool place! Second floor is Chocolate!! Sunday Brunch! Big choice of drinks, all with champagne! Cupcakes, chocolate fountain, waffles, music, outside dining (if you are in the mood,) great view of the Strip!"}
{"text":"Girls night, happy hour and shareable food(; happy hour all day Friday. Drinks are awesome, and bartenders are super nice.  Check in and get a coupon too:) the goblets are worth it. Chicken fingers are good for two people $10 (;"}
{"text":"It's all about the staff, second disappointment and we didn't even eat there. I thought this one would be different but I was wrong. No more sugar factory for me."}
{"text":"We stopped in for some dessert cocktails. We had the chocolate peanut butter and the red velvet cake. The service was great. The red velvet cake cocktail was awful- tasted kind of like pepto bismol, rather than robustly chocolate. I won't order that one again, but the chocolate peanut butter was amazing."}
{"text":"What a nightmare. First time visit for our party of 5. Was surprised their dinner menu was one sheet of paper fresh off their printer and was very underwhelming. We ordered drinks and everyone got theirs right away except me. My drink came after we were served dinner.  I asked if there were any dinner specials and  Matt our waiter described the New York steak dinner that came with baked potato and salad. He then said it really was potato skins and lettuce to fill the plate. That sounded okay to me if he could make the salad cesar . When my plate was served it was a steak and green beans with 4 grilled shrimp. That was not what I wanted and  gave him the plate back. I hate green beans and never order shrimp grilled.  He offered to leave the plate and take it off the bill and get me something else. I asked him to bring me a small Cesar salad. I was brought a mixed green salad. I asked the waiter what type of salad it was and he tried to correct what he said and called it a Cesar salad when I told him that is what I ordered. At that point my steak was getting cold and I didn't want to argue with the waiter. So I ate my mixed green salad with tomatoes and cucumbers and no romaine lettuce.  We later ordered a mudslide desert after Matt the waiter described all the ingredients including my daughters favorite coffee ice cream. He then came back to the table and said they were out of coffee ice cream.  I also found it strange that the drink menu has absolutely no prices and we were then told its happy hour so drinks are 1/2 off.  By the way he didn't take my plate off the bill. They didn't however charge me for the mixed green salad that I didn't order."}
{"text":"Sugar Factory receives high points for novelty and ambiance. The smoking goblet signature drinks are just plain fun--especially when shared with friends. The food is nothing special, but satisfying in quantity and quality. Of course this place excels with the desserts. Our milkshakes were excellent!"}
{"text":"I am a local.  In our paper last week this location was showcased.  I was very excited to go and have their ice cream cone which is surrounded by cotton candy.. It is a Sunday at 11:45 a.m . There ice cream showcase is empty, 100% and the Gelato is 3/4 empty and what WAS in this case looked like it had been eaten and put back, very messy and unappetizing.. I asked if this was the only ice cream they had, and I was told yes..Very disappointed.  I will not make the trek back to the strip for this.."}
{"text":"After having a late lunch in the food court, we decided to wander out to Sugar Factory for ice cream . We were seated in the upstairs \"chocolate lounge\". Area did not appear busy, only 3 other tables were occupied.  Ordered: Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding $12 and Fried Ice Cream & Oreo Cookie $12 (with the plan to split between two people)...were later told that they were out of fried oreos. Ordered the Cookie Jar Sundae for Two $14 (again meant to split between two people)  Received: \"An extra shake\"...while waiting for our orders to arrive, a different server came to our table and dropped off a milkshake saying that it was extra from another table's order. We graciously thanked her and sampled what we believe was a cookies n cream shake. Caramel Brownie Bread pudding: Traditional bread pudding served cold with bits of fudge brownies..all swimming in a pool of melted vanilla ice cream. 2 spoons arrived with the bread pudding. No napkins were provided.  Service: Waiter checked in with us four times:  1. to drop off waters & menus  2. take initial order  3. informed us that one order could not be completed as they ran out of fried oreos  3.5--After waiting 30 minutes (after bread pudding was dropped off) flagged waiter down to ask about our missing sundae, she pointed at the \"extra shake\" and said that was what we had ordered. When we asked why it wasn't a sundae, she responded \"it's the same thing...just blended\", with further questioning she blamed the kitchen and said \"they've been messing up orders lately\" 4. to drop off the bill    The check: We were charged for the caramel brownie bread pudding $12 & a (not ordered) cookie jar milkshake $11 Based off this check, I believe the server entered in our order incorrectly (despite stressing that the ice cream sundae was going to be for two people)..but wasn't apologetic (instead passing the blame to the other staff).  Cleanliness: Table surface was not cleaned completely. A different waiter came by mid-way through our wait with a rag to wipe extra chocolate off the side of our table. Floor was sticky in some areas. Crumbs/sprinkles on seat.  OVERALL: As a local, I would PASS on this tourist spot. Poor service and dining experience = an \"extra\" order we were charged for, a missing order, and no napkins/utensils or drink refills"}
{"text":"Amazing team! Awesome food, drinks, and service. The only issue I had was the unfriendliness of the \"owner!\"  I think he was the owner. Had a hat on and gave dirty looks and didn't say hello to a single person eating there.  A complete attitude problem. He should feel lucky to have such an awesome team!"}
{"text":"We are in town for a soccer tournament. A few of us purchased a Groupon to use and our boys were so excited about eating there. There were four adults and six kids. We sat down and the server was extremely rude when he said he wouldn't split the check with us. Then we told him that two Groupons and he said we could only use one and we should've read the fine print that there was one Groupon per table. We asked to speak to the Manager. The server then came over and threw a laminated copy of the Groupon fine print to us. We asked to have us sit at separate tables and were told no. The Manager didn't come talk to us and my husband went and spoke to someone else. They explained that since we came in together...we are considered a group and they wouldn't do it. Oh...and the restaurant was empty. They wouldn't even consider letting us move tables. Needless to say, we all got up and left. Hoping that Groupon will give us our  money back. Worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Large menu, good for lunch, deserts and mix drinks. Atmosphere was a little weird - couldn't quite put my finger on it but it could have been the outdated-feel and the average customer service. It was kinda quiet, might have been a slow day. Menus felt greasy and chairs were grimy- not a good start. My turkey burger and fries were  good but my husband didn't not like his hot wings. Pictures of all the celebs that have visited the restaurant was interesting to see."}
{"text":"Love the gourmet popcorn.  The buffalo ranch cured all my salty cravings.  Nice place to pick up a gift.  Fun, tongue in cheek toys and cute tanks.  Check out the $4 alcoholic artisan truffles, made in LV."}
{"text":"This was such a cute, fun place to have brunch. The decor is bright and colorful, with a neighboring candy shop. I really wanted to come after seeing the menu of smoking goblets and food offerings online.   I ordered The Drake goblet, which was topped with cotton candy and filled with peachie-ohs gummy candy. I loved it, but it should be served with a spoon to fish out the peachie-ohs! They were stuck to the bottom of the glass. The white chocolate burger was good, but not what I expected. The ganache on top makes the burger difficult to eat. My hands were a sticky mess trying to maneuver through this dish. Maybe it would be better if the ganache was inside the burger. It would kill the visual effect that the restaurant is probably going for, but it would make it much easier to eat. The burger itself also needed salt to balance out the sweetness of the chocolate. It wasn't until the last couple of bites that I tasted any salt on the burger. But the best was saved for last, because those two bites were sweet and salty greatness.  The only pitfall was our server. It seemed like he came around often when we didn't need him, or he was nowhere to be found when we did need him. Overall, it was a great experience, and I would come again."}
{"text":"If you wanna clubbing while dinning, best choice!!!"}
{"text":"We just stopped by this place as we were walking by an haf an amazing dining experience!  The food was excellent and our server, Dwight was polite and attentive.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my birthday and from the time I sat down the experience was amazing. Our waiter Matt was OUTSTANDING. I'm very big on customer service and Matt exceeded most standards. We didn't have to ask for anything more than once, he memorized our orders and was very efficient. He showed us a great time while remaining professional which I know at times can be hard to balance. Amazing customer service! Our appetizers and food both came out in a timely manner. The food has nice portions, we had a party of 10 and only a few of us finished our plates. The drinks were amazing!! I totally suggest the place and hopefully you're there on a day when Matt and Justin are both working!"}
{"text":"Took my daughter and her friends there for her 12th birthday.  The service was outstanding!  Justin (our server) and Amanda (the manager) were so nice and friendly.  They even surprised my daughter with a b-day sunday w/o me asking.  Keep up the excellent work!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat! Love the service, ambiance, and food! Especially the DESSERTS!! Ate here for brunch with my husband and had a great experience! Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"A group of us came here to try out the fun drinks and of course check out the candy shop.   We sat upstairs in the chocolate lounge bar. It was more quite and relax.   We got the Drake and my godson got the Watermelon Patch.   The Drake was kind of too sweet for my liking but the first few sips were good.   My godson really enjoyed his watermelon patch and we saw the sugar kick in afterwards lol.  After our drink we took the elevator downstairs to check out the candy store. The restaurant downstairs was busy and a lot more lively.   The candy selection here was more limited we didn't see any of their well known lollipops but that didn't stop some of my friends from bringing back a container of sugar"}
{"text":"I came here for my 18th birthday with a few friends. They have a happy hour from 2-6 PM Monday-Friday (unfortunately, we came at 7.) I had the grilled chicken sandwich, and the chicken was kind of pink, but it took about 45 minutes to get and I was hungry so I didn't send it back. We also shared a frozen hot chocolate, which had potential, but I was literally chewing on ice the whole time. The service was pretty slow and it's a little pricier than Cheesecake Factory, but not by much. I'll give it another try soon and hope it's better!"}
{"text":"I would go here daily if my waste line would allow!! The shakes where alone a meal and SO GOOD! Spinach dip was different but WOW it was good! Neat spin on a caprese salad. It was different for sure but liked it very much. $20 for 5 mini rainbow burgers and a duck! Hesitant to try but took a risk and boy it paid off!! All the food was enough for 4 ppl when we only had 2! Terri was so kind in bagging up our left overs. Music is loud and hip hop but it fits the funky fun atmosphere. They have a full bar with drinks full of candy that smoke pours out of... can be made w out alcohol. I didn't get this time (have had in the past tho and YES ITS WOTH THE COST!)  Highly recommend for visiting tourists! They have a candy store attached and an upstairs area that's stunning!!  Greeters gladly took pics along w our waitress!! Her alone is worth going again she put our experience over the top.  Stopped to thank MGR and let him know about how everything was wonderful and even the cashier helping in the candy shop was a doll!! A must do again!!!"}

{"text":"Watch out for the gnats....  Sugar Factory you let me down for the LAST time.  When I go to a restaurant with $24 food items, I expect to dine without gnats flying around me.  Yuck!    I used to love the Sugar Factory at Paris, then they took away the secret dining room in the back with the fondue tables, and so I stopped going to that location, plus I hate the strip.  I was sooooo excited when they opened the location at Town Square.  I figured I would be there all of the time.   The first few times there were good/  I even remember a visit that was great!  But the last two or three times have been gross.    I went with my cousin from out of town and her friends, the food was a half step above McDonalds, but I did not want to complain to her.  Tonight when I went, I was terribly disappointed.  The menu consisted of page after page of drinks, and then more pages of desserts and there was an afterthought food menu of a one sided 5.5\" x 8.5\" sheet of paper (laminated of course).  The crepes that I loved are gone, the breakfast foods are gone, left were regular bar foods, salads, and over-priced entrees.    The meal started off fine, my friend and I were seated at 6p (Wednesday night) and were one of two tables in the place.  We got a booth, were talking for quite some time and then realized when we finally looked at the menu that the food was only that half sheet of, (well can you call that food? I guess) food.    We ordered salads because we really wanted crepes (our usual).  And I ordered a personal pizza.  I have no idea how long it took the salads to come out, because we were talking so much, but when they did, the greens were not completely fresh, but they were not completely wilted.  As we were eating that, I smelled something that smelled like burned bread.  I jokingly told my friend that I hoped it was not my pizza, and after the burn smell, my pizza took a while to come out... so I suspect it was the pizza.     The gnats gathered on the table while we were eating the salads, and we were swatting them away while we ate.  GROSS.  Then my pizza came out. I ended up pulling it closer so I could reach to swat the gnats away easier.  The conversation consisted of us talking, swatting and saying, \"Oh, there is another one!\"  I finally got fed up and told the guy in the pink shirt, what ever his name was that there were gnats at the table and could he get rid of them?  Instead of offering us a different table, he oh so kindly pointed couple out and swatted at them too.  SERIOUSLY.    I asked for a box so I did not have to focus so hard on swatting the gnats away from my food.  The waitress came and I told her about the gants and she said, \"Oh\"  and put my boxes in the bag.  While we were paying the bill, I saw several gnats land on the bag.  I could not get out of there fast enough.     I will NEVER be back.  If they offered me a free meal, I would not be back.  Maybe if they gave me pre-packaged candy, I would take it to go, but I would worry about whether or not gnats landed on any of the stuff out in the open."}
{"text":"Awesome service, atmosphere, and menu.  We came for brunch.  The menu is not deep, kinda on the high carb side.   Extensive dessert and drink menu.  Unlike every else we've been in Vegas these drinks come with a punch.  Good times.  The manager even came over just to thank us for dining here.  Great spot.  The loud woo-girl music is a little distracting but still fun."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with not only the service, but the food is awful as well.  I don't even think they deserve 1 star. When I made the manager aware that we hadn't received our milkshakes in an hour and a half, he didn't even apologize. He just asked who our waitress was. It's almost as if this is normal here. The waitress told us another table was waiting 1.5 hours as well. I would not waste my time or money on this over priced \"restaurant\""}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great atmosphere and the food is fantastic. They have these 60 oz. drinks called goblets and they look wonderful, but I was too stuffed to try it out; however, we will stop back in for one at some point before we head home! Prices are high, but comparable to other restaurants on the strip and the food is absolutely worth it!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend for his 30th birthday the other night. I wanted a special dinner for him since we were visiting from Phoenix and it was his special night. I have always noticed the fun goblets from sugar factory and decided that would be a fun experience for him. When we got to our seats our waiter was Chaz. Chaz was fine, decent waiter. Once we finished our dinners the wait staff comes out singing happy birthday to my boyfriend with a BIG sparkler on top of some ice cream, very cute display. Then I get the bill... $10 charge for the birthday dessert. What!!??? We were dumbfounded. Not once was I ever asked if I'd like to add that on or anything about a charge for the birthday dessert. ANY restaurant, even fancy steakhouses, don't ever charge for a birthday dessert. I first brought it up to Chaz and he said they do charge for it and it's not a mistake and he went to speak to his manager to see if they can take it off. He comes back and mentions his manager can take off $5, not cool. It's not about the money, it's about making your customers aware of your charges beforehand I ask to speak to the manager and he comes to our table. He mentions \"we are known for our birthdays\" ok... so if you are known for your birthdays then you'd think they would be included in the \"experience\". He was sort of fighting me on it back and forth and then just gave in and said he will adjust it off our bill. It should have been no questions asked, but instead he ruined our experience and my boyfriends birthday dinner (for me anyways because I wanted the greatest experience ever for him). Not cool sugar factory."}
{"text":"Being in the service industry I'm very forgiving, but this place left me mad that I wasted my money. Neither the hostess nor server brought a highchair for my baby, I finally had to ask another server to bring one. That was after 10 min of people walking past me with a 1 yr old on my lap. Then the food was subpar. My daughters pancakes were heavy and gooey almost raw. My \" kitchen sink\" salad was all lettuce with only a couple pieces of  meat, cheese ect.... Not worth the $14.00 we paid.  I left Hungary  and mad."}
{"text":"Food good. Appetizers came out same time as entries.  Service pretty good.  Energy great. Nice place."}
{"text":"Not a satisfied customer! One I order 2 big ass drinks for 40.00 EACH (2) and it's no liquor WTF  second I order a 13.00 salad plus 6 for chicken and they bring me out a half of a salad.. why are u charging me for a full and I get a half?  Smh"}
{"text":"Initial visit (one star): Service was poor. Our poor waiter had three large parties to deal with with no extra help! The food is subpar and the drinks are disgusting. I will not be returning!    Update (three stars): Corey with management reached out to me and extended a complimentary return visit. We took him up on his offer as we were return to Las Vegas last month. The service this time was much better, the staff was attentive and not overwhelmed, and the food and drinks came out timely."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have dinner and/or dessert! My wife and I split the sliders, a basket of fries, the Reeses pieces pizza and a giggles snicker shake (something like that). Food was AMAZING. Service was FANTASTIC. Ambience was ON POINT.   Could not have better things to say about this place. We went for my sister's birthday and it made for a very special birthday dinner! Sugar Factory is a must try if you're in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"It's right on par with the Vegas experience but the food and drinks were average and overpriced in my opinion. The goblet drinks are impressive but pricey at upwards of $40!   The atmosphere is bougie and ornate, but also somehow really superficial; with large chandeliers, bold and dramatic decor, and classic finishes-it's a beautiful space. Then there's the copious tvs with photos of celebs and brand \"whoring\" in your face, along with loud music.   Service was good. Fast and attentive, but it was a mid week lunch service so I can't speak to what a weekend dinner service might look like.   I could see maybe returning for their huge and over the top sundaes, desserts, and fondues for a special occasion but it definitely won't be making it's way into the regular rotation with (extra) overpriced drinks and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Omg where to begin!!!!! While visiting vegas this past weekend i decided to stop here and check this place out. It seems pretty popular and well known. The ambiance has an upbeat diner feel. I ordered some sliders to start and it took forever for them to come out i knew it had been sitting on the food line because it was almost as cold as ice when we received them!  Before putting in our order for the sliders we requested that the sliders would be light on the salt the server then says SHE DOESN'T MAKE THE FOOD i was in complete shock for hearing such a rude comment i was so frustrated. i have been working in the industry for years and would never say that snarky to a guest and obviously it is your job to tell the kitchen our requests that is essentially what a server does? Anyway, i ordered the country fried chicken and it was a nightmare the chicken was greasy and burnt! Probably from being on the food line for so long or the cooks must have really had a long night. I don't recommend this place at all unless you're drinking. This is more of a I'm too drunk to care what I'm putting in my body type of place or maybe if you have a sweet tooth otherwise 0.5 stars."}
{"text":"This Town Square location is an above average place. I waiver between 3 and 4 stars, but will give it the 4. It's got above average prices, but it ain't too bad for what you get. And there are usually some specials or groupons or other things that can help you shave off some cost.  This location is smaller than the Strip/casino versions. It has a much much smaller section for the candy items. But I like that about this place - it keeps it feeling more like a restaurant.  The space itself is pretty and well-appointed. Clean and modern. Very nice. I really like sitting in the booths. They're u-shaped and offer plenty of space. And they're actually pretty comfy. There's also a nice outdoor patio section too. And there's a bar area as well where you can sit and dine.  The service I've experienced here as always been good. Friendly and very attentive. I really appreciate how the servers keep you posted as to the status of your order. And they're always good about letting you know about drink deals and whatnot.  The menu is plentiful. Lots of options. And it's always so hard to choose. Everything from red velvet pancakes to chocolate crepes to burgers to omelettes  to steak to sundaes. Plenty of both sweet and savory options. Plenty of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert options.  The red velvet pancakes (especially with the white chocolate syrup) are quite yummy. I also enjoyed the eggs benedict with salmon and asparagus. And the sundaes are, naturally, pretty darn awesome. And quite sizable too. The sundae for two could really be a sundae for four.  Brunch is a definite good deal here as they do offer all-you-can-drink bloody marys and mimosas. And you literally never even have to ask for another one, as another one will be at your table before you've even finished the drink you're on. And they'll even bring them to you two at time.  All in all, I'm becoming a fan of this place, and will be back again and again."}

{"text":"AMAZING SERVICE!!! ASK FOR RIKKI: I have been to the Town Square location a couple of times and prior to tonight, they had sub-standard service... Great food though & awesome fun drinks which I loved, so I tried again with my family from Utah. I was amazed at how fantastic and super attentive our server, Rikki (aka Ricardo) was!!! He got our order in last minute so we could eat even though he didn't have to make it work when their kitchen closed at 10pm and we wanted to order at 9:56pm. He was fun and really seemed to care about his profession at the Sugar Factory Town Square.  Smiling everywhere he walked in the restaurant! I loved the fun time that he seemed to be having while working. He was there every single time we needed him, he went above & beyond with my 5 year old son, telling me to order the kids menu fried macaroni & cheese instead of the adult app size (which would have benefitted him in bill size...) he even put my son's ice water in a kids cup with lid & straw w/o being asked (that's a BIG plus!!!). Plus my cousin's daughter was newly 21, so she was given the fireworks in her comp dessert. I can say enough about how great the service was with Rikki, though.  He has set the bar very high for my return visits... I will be asking for his section, always!!!"}
{"text":"Saw pix of the cute place & drinks we decided to try out this place for a bday dinner. Our drinks & food order was taken pretty quickly. Food was ok. I ordered the Salmon nothing too great. If it wasn't for the lil sauce they had on the plate I think it would have been too dry. But the sauce was yum. The drink was tasty but too pricey since you don't get to keep the cup. I ordered the same drink the day before on the strip paid $38 & got to keep my cup. The restaurant was $42 (I believe) & if you want the cup its $15 more. We also ordered a shake that we kept asking the waiter for. The electricity went out therefore we were not able to order anything else so our dinner was cut short. Note: we never got the shake we ordered from the very beginning yet he said because the lights went out they were unable to make it. Yet it was ordered & asked for over & over. I can't say I'd recommend this place. I don't mind spending but as long as I feel its worth it & the experience wasn't great here."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time and every piece of candy I bought was not only expensive but completely stale. I couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Excellent food. The service was very slow and restaurant was not busy. We were in a hurry and had plenty of time, but bc service was slow it messed up our plans."}
{"text":"Place is empty. Totally ignored by staff.    VERY overpriced for what you get. Don't bother"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 Stars because the girl who helped me out the night I visited was the SWEETEST thing ever! Very helpful, and kind.  I purchased the bling pop in Black ($22, but the ones with charms are $25), personalized mints($3.25, I think?), and a Lollipop Refill Pack ($12 for 3 custom Pops) I haven't had a chance to crack open my packages yet, but I'm sure I'll love anything that comes out of this place.  Definitely give it a shot if you're staying at, or visiting MGM Grand. It's such a fun environment :)"}
{"text":"How sad. We LOVED sugar factory when it was at Paris but it's definitely dropped in standards.   For starters, we made a reservation for 1.45 and they obviously knew nothing about it - the hostess struggled to find us a table and led us to one that was still covered in dishes! We sat down as she cleared this away, came back to ask what name it was under and then wiped down the table. Ok...  Nearly 15 minutes later we got asked if we were ready for drinks. Ordered 3 martinis and our food as well - 2 burgers and the fettuccine. The group next to us asked for their check about this time.   20 minutes later...no drinks. The group next door asked for their check again. We saw several goblets and insane milkshakes being served at the bar but nothing came our way.   Finally, almost 45 minutes after we sat down we got our drinks. Our food came shortly after that and the next door peeps finally got their check after asking for the 3rd time and noticing how long we had been waiting.   I give one star for the food being delicious and the other star for our poor server, who advised one of them has just walked out for no reason and \"something's going on in the kitchen, I don't even know what.\" Poor staff, I felt really sorry for them with such disorganisation going on."}
{"text":"The goblets are fun and always good for anyone that hasn't tried one. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad and there was nothing special about it, definitely not worth $19 especially after waiting 30 minutes for it. We also ordered a dessert and someone had to remind our waiter about it because he came back after another half hour and asked what dessert we wanted and said it must have slipped his mind. I'm a very patient person and will usually put up with a lot but this service was so bad and I will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 3 because this place gets a lot of hype. Breakfast sucked!! I felt like they rushed the food. I ordered the ham and cheese omelette that comes with home fries and they were crap! Greasy and the bottom of the barrel portion! What home fries!!? I was truly disappointed. I guess they need to stick to their milkshakes and specialty drinks!  Service was fast and our waiter was great!"}
{"text":"AVOID IF YOU CAN!  Okay, so I rarely give such low reviews (it's true, go check out my other reviews to see) but this place deserves NO stars if possible.  It makes me wonder how it took over half an hour for me and my bf to receive two ordinary milkshakes, while everyone else around us got not only their milkshakes but their food too! I mean, we had 3 changes of people to the right and left of us. Quite inexcusable. We later found out the order wasn't even processed, so we got them instantly after, but then had to wait another 20 minutes for our bill (after finishing our shakes).  Worst part was that they didn't apologize or try to reconcile. AVOID THIS PLACE. Also, the shakes aren't worth the incredible amount they charge. Just a shit show here."}
{"text":"Highly recommended especially if BRANDON is your  server. He's the best. Perfect ambiance. Drinks are awesome and tasty. White gummi was super good"}
{"text":"This review is for the candy store part. I like this store. It's a regular candy store, to be honest which isn't that special. However, I ordered a caramel macchiato from them and although it was pretty steep in price, it was the best I've ever had. I really enjoyed the drink. It was smooth and balanced. It wasn't too sweet or too bitter. I would never have thought it would have been so good coming from a candy store. A waiter walked by with what looked like the most delicious milkshake I've ever seen. The employees were very nice and helpful as well. I will definitely be back to try a goblet and some food...maybe even one of those amazing looking milkshakes."}
{"text":"Terrible service! We were a group of 6 and went for breakfast. They only had herbal tea, no regular (but they had coffee -??) We had to ask 3 times for jam and in the end only got it for the table when I had to go inside and track someone down. Food was cold by that time. We waited well over an hour for eggs and when we finally did get our food it was wayyyy undercooked for two of us. We waited another 30 mins for a fried egg to be redone -??? AND THEY WERE SLIMY AND UNDERCOOKED AGAIN!! In the end the two meals got comped but when our friends got their bill there was an automatic 18% tip added to their bill. Ridiculous!!! Oh and they also said they would not accept change. Give me a break. The Kardashians might get the royal treatment here but not everyday people and we were not the only table complaining. Never again!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting this establishment for a birthday party. There was a group of about 20 people. The server and the manger refused to split our bill amongst the multiple people in the group. After gratuity and tax, our bill was approximately $800. (They went back and gave us 10% military discount) When we asked the server, his explanation was that it was easier for him to just keep it all on one check. When we asked the manager, he would only say \"I'm sorry, we just can't\". Therefore, leaving us to figure out the bill, tax, and gratuity amongst 20+ people. AND on top of that, the drinks were weak, and my burger was absolutely terrible. There was no flavor and it was extremely dry. Save your money. It was overpriced and not worth it."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and absolutely love it. Adrian was an awesome server. Highly recommend the ocean blue and white gummi!"}
{"text":"I'd come here again. Definitely the sugar factory. The waiter, Anthony, was very patient, and willing to help & give recommendations...we had a party of 10 and he did great with making sure we had all we need. My burger wasn't what I expected it to be but they had no issue with fixing it and I'm happy with the overall service received."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on July 4th - excited to go as we loved the Sugar Factory when it was at the Paris.  I will never be back. The service was terrible.  The restaurant ran out of clean eating utensils and napkins.  The waitress told us to \"just eat with our hands.\"  The fish bowl drinks were a huge disappointment.  We had intended to have dessert but after the terrible dinner experience we just wanted to get out of there...the manager was worthless when I wanted to talk about my not paying the full added on gratuity for my party of 11.  Terrible service, no water refills, no silverware or napkins does not equal the full gratuity!  Paid the check just to get out of there.  What a sharp decline from the former place...terribly managed."}
{"text":"Sugar factory is great! The drinks are delicious and the experience was wonderful. I love how the staff works together as a team. Even though our waitress was busy, the rest of the staff was very on top of it at assisting our needs. great job!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting to receive such phenomenal service here. They really blew me away. Thank you for making my daughter feel like a princess on her 4th birthday.   Sugar Factory is a cute and lively spot with over-the-top drinks and shakes. Sure, you'll be paying strip prices and the food is standard quality for a chain restaurant, but the crazy shakes and desserts are actually pretty good value. The crazy shake I ordered had a slice of cheesecake, a huge rainbow lollipop, a sugar daddy, and the mug was huge! The shake itself was actually quite delicious, it tasted like homemade ice cream, which was surprising. I think that's worth the $19.   But really, the service was impeccable. The staff was so kind and thoughtful. I will definitely be returning for dessert because of the wonderful time we had.  *update: after trying shakes at a different, new establishment on the strip that's known for their crazy shakes, Sugar Factory is my first choice. SF shakes are a couple dollars more but worlds better when it comes to taste. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in for a quick dessert. We waited for over 20 minutes because we didn't have a \"reservation' at 4:30. They finally sat us and no one came for 10 minutes. When we ordered the server told us they were out so we ordered two more times for her to tell us we were out. Then we finally ordered and we waited for 45 minutes and nothing came so we had to leave because we were late for a show"}
{"text":"Very Disappointing. My sister and I Visited this location earlier this afternoon, and were highly disappointed in the service and food. We normally love this place and visit every time we're in LV. I'm not sure if there have been recent changes in management or what. The waiter had no personality, never smiled, or introduced himself. He was very short and blunt with his responses to our questions.   Now for the food. I was in disbelief. We love their signature burger and other entrées, but there must have been a new cook today. I could have made a better meal at home for less. The macaroni and cheese tasted like it was sponsored by Kraft and the burger was disgusting. This was the worst way to start our trip. Something has got to give! We will not be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Omg! This was place to die for they have the best ice cream shake ever. If you ever want to do your birthday you should come here they offer a ice cream bowl with 24 different scoop of ice cream flavor and they come out with sparkler on the ice cream. They also have fish bowls with different gummy flavors mixed with the drink along with liquor mixed in with the drink. This place gives you a chance to act like a kid in a candy store it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! My turkey, Brie sandwich was awesome. I would recommend this as more of a lunch spot or after dinner spot for food and dessert."}
{"text":"My daughter was dying to go here and try one of the specialty drinks.  She was thrilled with the presentation- suckers, candy necklace and dry ice.  My son got a milk shake and said it was delicious. My biggest complaint was the price of the drink- $34 for a non-alcoholic drink seems pricey, even for Vegas standards.  Overall, a fun experience."}
{"text":"I think we can all agree how exciting the sugar factory drinks are! As far as pricing goes, you're looking at $40 for an alcoholic Goblet and $30 for the non-alcoholic drinks.   The service was good. The staff works very well together. If you ask one person for something, a few seconds later someone else would bring it. I do want to shoutout one of the staff would was so sweet and helpful! His name is Richard, I believe he may have been a food runner but secretly I liked him more than my actual server (Shh!) .   I ordered the chicken tenders and fries, basic but a good choice. The other two ladies in my party ordered the chicken quesadilla. There were fresh, a good amount of chicken, however, the taste was very bland. I even tried to add hot cause for a little flavor and they did not solve the issue. I get it, Sugar Factory is known for their drinks not food but the quesadillas was such a let down."}
{"text":"Sugar factory is God's gift to this world! The one at town square is AMAZING! Went for lunch and had no trouble getting a table. I love the decor and the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. Our server Monique was one of the best I've ever had. She was helpful and checked on us the perfect amount of times. She was able to help me pick the PERFECT drink (aka goblet). The menu has everything you would ever need on it. Anything from breakfast to burgers to pasta to dessert. Everything that we got was yummy and a good serving amount. The food is definitely priced very well for what you get. If it is your birthday let the server know because they have a funny way of wishing you a happy birthday. If you don't want to deal with the craziness of the strip head over to town square. I highly recommend this restaurant and Monique as a server. I will definitely be back any chance that I get. This place is life changing!"}
{"text":"My family had such a great time here at the Sugar Factory at Fashion Show Mall. We celebrated my nieces 18th birthday so my family reserved a space in the Chocolate Lounge. When you first enter the lounge there's a step and repeat sign (photo backdrop) where you can take pictures in front of it.   The chocolate lounge is upstairs and right off the back patio where you can ride a carousel and take beautiful pictures. It's very picturesque! It has spectacular views of the strip and the lights are breathtaking at night.   So much food was ordered for my niece and her friends. They each received red candy buckets on the table. But why not! It's the sugar factory! They each ordered the infamous Goblets. Each one ordering from their own taste. Hers which ones they ordered (Virgin of course!) duh!   Lollipop Passion   The Drake - I ordered this! You can always count on me for cotton candy   White Gummi Watermelon Patch   Each goblet is super cute! You can take the cup home for an additional $15 on top of the already $25 drink. You decide if it's worth it.   Anyways, the food was delish. I ordered the rainbow  sliders.   Other food ordered (which was all family style) was:  Banana Split Waffle Country fried chicken and waffle -  Baskets of fries Fried Mac & Cheese Pops Spinach Artichoke Dip Grilled Mini Burgers Sampler Platters Chinese chicken salad  The Signature Sugar Factory Burger - my husband ordered   All this food came around a thousand times! So much was ordered and it was all delicious.   Service was great! Especially for a party of such large size.  Parking was fine. We parked in the Neiman Marcus parking lot and walked right up to Las Vegas Blvd. we did get lost by going to the Miracle Mike Shops. That's not the right one if you're trying to find the chocolate lounge. She did give me a couple coupons for the mixup. Lol   I really cannot wait to go back there.  I think the one in Los Angeles is open. I wonder if they'll have the same flair. I'll definitely be going."}
{"text":"Food is decent though seems a bit overpriced, then again it's Vegas and right on the strip. Goblets are a cool experience but I wouldn't buy more then 1 at $40 a pop. Service was decent. Not outstanding. Not bad. We had the goblet with Red Bull - it was pretty good."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette brunch. The food I ordered was good (Monte Cristo Sandwich). The server was super nice and the location is very convenient to where we were staying at. Wouldn't mind coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Updated review:  After much hesitation that I would come back and waste my time again,  I decided to return and I have to say this time they delivered. Completely different experience than our last trip. We were greeted with a friendly smile and were sat right away. Food was good(came out in a timely manner), drinks were great! They even went out if their way to make me a drink that was on their online menu but not on the menu at the restaurant. Service was great as well( thank you, Nikki!).  Thank you Sugar Factory for making it right!   I can't even with this place! Hey get a 1 because I have no other choice. Where to start? my party and I arrive and are given a 10-15 minute wait time. Sit at the bar and order a margarita which seems like a complicated order for the bartenders. Get he margarita and I don't know what it was but it was not a margarita. Fine. Make some adjustments to it and still not a margarita but whatever. 40 minutes later still waiting and I approach the hostess stand and I'm told about 20 more minutes. Wait 20 more minutes, nothing. THIRTY more minutes and still not seated. Finally we get seated and it's not a booth as requested but a table that seems like it was pulled from outside and placed by the kitchen area. Our server comes to introduce himself,make small talk and we make a comment about the wait time. Even after all that, the service is TERRIBLE!! Order drinks,appetizer and entree and as you can guess..long wait time. Order a second drink which never comes until we ask another employee passing by to please get our waiter and get us our check.  He shows up with the second drink we ordered 30 minutes before. Unfortunately I had to send that back as by now I am fuming and ready to get the hell out of this place!  The check comes and it's incorrect. I get it's busy but that's no excuse for this type of service there are way too many other places I can spend my money!     Ps: the bathrooms are disgusting!!! Fail all the way around!"}
{"text":"I initially made reservations for the Sugar Factory and it was way too loud. It was almost like we were at a night club and it was only 6PM! Our server recommended for us to go to the chocolate lounge that is a little more private. The moment we walked in the server/bartender (gay guy with blonde hair) was RUDE AF. He told us and the host that all the tables were reserved and we had to sit outside. Funny he said that, when there was only one table with a reserved sign. FYI--We were seated at one of the tables INSIDE THE CHOCOLATE LOUNGE. Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to come, to get our beverage order, and the food. The food is not good, at least not for dinner. It's pretty much like diner food with contemporary furniture. The only plus with this restaurant is the view."}
{"text":"As Vegas locals we love coming to town square and have come into Sugar Factory a few times since it's opening, thanks to the server Matt!  Matts super knowledgeable about all the drinks and food items. He always has great recommendations each time we come in. The service has always been fast and attentive as we come in before movies sometimes.   The turkey burger is awesome, not like neighboring yard houses frozen like patty! We tried the sexual chocolate cocktail, banana chunk martini, caramel macchiato, and of course we had to try a goblet too. Matt recommended the sunshine tea, awesome choice! Just like an Arnold Palmer..   To sum it all up we will def be returning again and again and of course asking to be seated with the server Matt! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this lunch with my 9 year old daughter because of the candy shop and being on vacation in Vegas. I didn't know about the Kartrashian connection. We sat inside and I unfortunately faced the tv - luckily she did not. I didn't let that bother me. Ladies (very close to us) at the next table had one of the fun fish bowl drinks. They didn't finish their food nor did they want to take it with them should have been a clue to me. My daughter had the chicken fettucine. We shared the $18 chocolate shake. I had a burger and fries. I finished my burger - it was good. too many fries but good. I tasted the fettucine and it was very rich, tasted fine. I didn't try any of the chicken. My kid got sick off the chicken and spent the evening and the next day in the hotel room sick and sleeping from nausea and stomach pains. Careful what you eat there. I would say - drink only."}
{"text":"Drinks were over-priced in my opinion considering the indecent amount of alcohol in these huge bowls. They taste great though. The service my friends and I received was less than subpar. She was discriminated against (she's a transsexual) and when she presented her ID the waitress didn't think it was her and gave us a very hard time. Not pleased with how she was treated. I really should've given this place 1 star but because the drinks were tasty you get 2."}
{"text":"I went to the sugar factory with my boyfriend the other day and it was an amazing experience!!! I would highly recommend this definitely to my friends and family ! I came one time and I'm hooked now !  I had the chicken parm and it was like one of the best that I've ever had. chef Chris and chef Alejandro are the best ! I will only go in now when they are there !  Please try this place and better yet this location and make sure Chris is there !!!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for Sugar Factory, and took the kids (6 & 8), and a few of their friends. All was Ok. Kids would say \"great\". Food was fair, drinks and other were definitely sweet, but then it is called the Sugar Factory. We were asked to move tables, after being seated and severed drinks because the area they sat us in was \"closed\"??? Service in the new are was lack luster, and when the bill came, there were three extra meals and two extra drinks that were from the table next to us. I would recommend for the kids, desert and such, but not really to par for food vs. other area places or that of the same name on the Strip."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and our waiter suggested we try the Passion Punch Goblet. It was really good! The atmosphere was fun and elegant. Food was great a bit pricey but the food proportions are pretty decent. Menz our waiter was very attentive and friendly! As well as all the staff that assisted us. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"If you love candy and sweets this place is great, if you like really delicious desserts, do not expect it from here. I was hoping for a delicious warm gooey fresh baked brownie and the one we got was hard and tasted like it was baked the day before. The fudge was cold, it was just mediocre."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Excellent food, perfect people watching, music you enjoy listening to.  The servers a re the best!  Nisse served us today with a big smile and great attitude!  I have also met a couple of the managers that are great asset to the restaurant.  I come here often as I can and highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for the first time i had so much fun great atmosphere delicious specialty drinks or maybe we just had an awesome server Lauren  she was so attentive! definitely will be going again...."}
{"text":"The SERVER My friend and I came here because she had a coupon. It was also happy hour. We sat down on the patio and waited at least 15 minutes until the busser even gave us water. We waited another 5 minutes & I saw only 1 server running around. It seemed he was the only one so I got up and spoke to the first person I saw whom was the pastry chef at the counter, which by the way should be a lead server as well because he was personable, kind, tried to make up for how terrible the service was by our 20 min late server with no personality and no smile. Pastry chef proceeded to take our order, bless his heart, then the server magically appears. He then tries to hurry us up, doesn't try to redeem the poor experience we're having. We asked what's in one of the goblet drinks,\"I'm a bartender, so I like to know what kind of alcohol is in my drink since the menu does not specify\" he said pineapple and coconut....Um ok pineapple and coconut what? I didn't feel like getting into it, just give us the $30 cocktail we've been waiting almost 25 min to order!  The wonderful pastry chef came out to bring us a candied apple. Yes it would spoil our meal but who knows how long that will take to come out.   The pastry chef gave us 2 to go bags filled with something we didn't get a chance to see because 2 min later our server comes out takes the bags and hands them to the other 2 ladies sitting across from us. Um, he doesn't come over to explain wtf just happened. Wow the communication at this place is Terrible.   The looks to be manager appears and comes over to touch our table and asks how is everything and kind of walks off like he could care less. I didn't have the energy to tell him everything or the time.  The FOOD & DRINK The drink was exceptional. The sliders were good. I could get great sliders anywhere but not that drink. I bartend at a very popular tourist destination on the strip and I get questions every day on where to go eat and drink and I won't be recommending your establishment.  In a city with so many unique cocktails and food, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a friend's birthday dinner & the experience was okay. Our server was pretty nice so I gotta give her credit since there was a lot of us.  I ordered: Chicken Fingers(appetizer): 4 normal sized pieces. I believe the normal price is $10, but 1/2 of for HH. These were alright, tasted like the average chicken finger. Overall 3.5/5  Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops(appetizer): 3 petite pieces. I believe this is also normally $10, but 1/2 off for HH. These were pretty good, but I wish it came with more pieces. Overall 4/5  Goblet: I can't remember the name, but it was the blue one w/shark gummies in it. I think it's normally $29 or $30, & this was also 1/2 off. I wish I could say I enjoyed this, but it was just alright. I feel like I just drank Powerade in a fancy goblet. Overall 2/5  I'm so glad it was happy hour. Otherwise, I probably would not pay regular prices for such small portions."}
{"text":"Went there with a good friend 2 weeks ago and had HORRIBLE service! I never saw our waiter, but we had drinks when I came back from going to the bathroom right away. Then we waited half an hour and finally just talked to a manager that was walking around. They had changed their menu and it was incredibly small and we were a little disappointed. I got the spicy chicken burger which was nice but expensive since it come with only the burger, and my friend got a pasta with a redish sauce. We asked the manager what kind of sauce it was and he said it was meaty which means????? She did not like it. We did have a cookie dough milkshake though which was INCREDIBLE! I almost did not get it because it was like $9, but that was by far the best part of our trip! I do not think I will go back due to bad service and over priced food, but I will try to find a milkshake that compares!"}
{"text":"A great exprience...good food big portions. Staff is wonderful. Ejoyed it so much came 2 days in a row."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to dine here forever!  The food did not disappoint!  It was so amazingly perfect. My friend and I shared the rainbow sliders (how freaking cute are those?!), the garbage salad and a red velvet sundae. The reasons I'm not giving it a solid five is because it was so incredibly loud in there I pretty much had to yell at my friend across the table from me.  It was hard to hold a conversation with anyone..I wish it hadn't been 115 out or we would have sat outside where it was slightly quieter. I get that it is probably part of their ambiance. The service was meh....Nothing special.  She kept my water glass full.  The one thing that kind of turned me off was the use of profanity at the table by the server. There is a certain level of professionalism that should be maintained and I was a little put off by that.  Not that I am a prude by any means but those words shouldn't be used in conversations with your guests--especially when you have a young child at the table with you."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but I was surprised when I got my bill because the non alcoholic goblet drink I got was $30.  My drink was more than my food.  No one told me the price of the drink and it wasn't printed in the menu.   That should have clearly been printed and fore warned about the price of the drink."}
{"text":"This place is so fun!!! It has a great outdoor area and inside was so cute and has an attached candy store. The drinks were amazing and loaded with candy We got the sliders and they were on bright colored buns. They tasted sooo good. Big menu and lots of selections. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was ok and food was decent. It seemed that everyone was no enthusiastic about anything. Anyways my son got the super large yellow duck and it was just amusing. Candy selection was something I could get at grocery store."}
{"text":"Love it!!! I'm so happy I came I love the decor it's so pretty and te music awesome classic music the food and drinks are good! I just wish my chicken tenders came with fries. The fondue is bomb! It had gummy bears, bananas, strawberries, brownies,lemon pound cake and marshmallows"}
{"text":"Fun place. Food is not that bad.  I love the drinks flavored candy. Best time to go is for breakfast and brunch.  Fries are amazingly good."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I don't give out many one star ratings, so when I do it's well deserved! It's taken me a few days to write this review because that's how long it took me to get the manager Marlon's name. I asked multiple employees there and because he was there they refused to give us his business card or name, I've never experienced this, EVER! He was super disrespectful not once but TWICE, second time rolling his eyes at my sister as I watched him. The reason we went back the second time is because we had already purchased a Living Social deal that was only redeemable at that location and we didn't use it the first night there cause the service was so bad we left immediately before losing my temper.   The first night we were moved from the bar area to the dining area cause of the kids with us, we were never told they were closed though, so we sat there waiting for a server until finally asking about 20 minutes later and that's when they told us the dining are is closed for the night. Really?! Marlon didn't seem to care one bit! We told them that the hours online say midnight, and he said he's not aware of any of Sugar Factory's online info, and just stared at us. We needs up leaving while he gave us an attitude and rolled his eyes, AGAIN!   DO NOT COME HERE FOR ANYTHING!!! Vegas is known for customer service this place treats you like scum."}
{"text":"This place was great! The two bartenders were awesome as well! The goblet drink was soooooo good! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé went to the Sugar Factory last Sunday with a Groupon. The drinks on the menu all had a candy like theme and looked delicious! The Groupon  already came with all you can drink mimosas so we didn't get a chance to try any of them. The food on the menu all looked great but as soon as I saw the Eggs Benedict I instantly got tunnel vision. Me and fiancé both ordered the Manhattan Eggs Benedict which came with grilled asparagus, salmon, and sat on scalloped potatoes. It was beyond excellent! Our server Max was just as excellent. His customer service skills deserves to be recognized and rewarded. He was attentive, patient, and very knowledgable of the menu. He was a very easy going guy and could relate and interact with any type of customer. Great Job Max! The next time we go back we will ask to sit in your section."}
{"text":"Great drinks!!! We wanted something sweet and with the right amount of alcohol and this place was just the thing. We got the drake and the peach mango bowls. They were great! Our server recommended them from all the different varieties. We also go the sampler platter to snack on while we ate. We loved the atmosphere and the service! Definitely recommend for either just desserts, drinks or actual meals."}
{"text":"Justin our server rocks as does the overall experience at Sugar Factory! Very good time and would come back"}
{"text":"Had lunch with family at the newly opened Sugar Factory! Great bartender Heather- wonderful server Max  thx for your \"excellent\" service... Ricardo is the best Manager.  Lunch was fun- we appreciated your professionalism & the super chef !"}
{"text":"Giving two stars because they did give us 1/2 off the bill and the manager was apologetic.   We had a reservation for a group of 8 people for a birthday dinner. We arrived at our scheduled time and were seated quickly. The place wasn't very busy but It took awhile for the waiter to get our drink order. He brought drinks a few at a time but didn't bring mine until I reminded him. Again he took some time to return for our food order. When we finally ordered, 5 of us ordered the chicken and waffles. About 20 minutes later the manager comes to our table saying they are out of chicken then says wait I'll be back. He comes back and says the actually do have enough chicken for our order and we were the last chicken & waffle order they could fill. Well.... our food finally comes out. The chicken and waffle plates should come with two pieces of friend chicken on the bone i.e. Breast and leg or thigh. Each of our plates had two wings, two chicken strips and a thigh. It was as if they used all the remaining chicken types they had left to make our plates. I personally don't like strips or thigh pieces. They didn't tell us this is how our orders would be filled or give us the option to change our order. So disappointing and not appetizing at all! After calling the manager over he did give us half off our total bill which was nice but at this point we've been here almost 2 hours and it's already after 9pm and those of us with the chicken and waffle orders now need to find something else to eat since we really didn't touch our food.   Seems the service and quality has declined since moving from the old location at the Paris. Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"i've had a blast at this location. amanda was our server and she made our experience fun and vibrant. i wish they had more locations in florida because i would be there every single week! thanks Vegas Sugar Factory for the memories."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey even for vegas but the ambiance and presentation of the food and drinks were amazing. Definitely a tourist spot and worth trying once"}
{"text":"I love Town Square Mall and am there for movies and shopping frequently.  I'm always glad to see a new place open and usually give it a few visits before I say anything good or bad.  As a  Vegas local i am always wary of \"celebrity hangouts\"  let's face it do these people really go there or are they just paid to show up and take a picture with the owner?  So this is kind of a mash up of things I have had heard and seen over a few visits.  The food can be hit or miss.  The BBQ chicken pizza and French Onion Soup were great.  Chicken fingers are like what I can get at a Dairy Queen for half the price and are a SYSCO item I am sure.  You would think they could bread and fry their own chicken..Blah!!!  Fries are unremarkable and just not that great.  None of the food is a stand out to me and certainly stuff you can get at any cut rate joint off the strip.  My one serious complaint is the wait times for food were a problem the first few times I went there.  It was obvious that the kitchen was not ready and totally overwhelmed.  The poor wait staff was run ragged and it seemed more food was given away than paid for.  The drink menu is massive and diverse.  The goblets are generous but can seem a bit pricey for one drink but can really knock you on your ass as they are pretty substantial (two girls could share one and still have some left).  They have a few beers on tap but this is not one of those million tap type places such as Yard House.   As time has gone on I have seen the service get better and better (mind you i am talking about the servers not the kitchen).  I have had great service from the Bar from Neal and his accent is awesome.  Servers Josh and Brandon have been great...even when other things about a visit weren't so great.  Here is my issue primarily with this place and why I am giving 3 stars.  I ask questions when I see something and I have been witness to some very poor treatment of employees on the floor by people who I am told are owners of this establishment.  I've heard very poor language in front of customers (with kids) from someone named Steve or Stevie who I am told is an owner/manager.  I also have seen someone named Tom who is reported to be a manager/owner berate an employee on the floor in full view of his table.  I also witnessed what could easily be viewed as sexual harassment or at the least very questionable behavior by this \"stevie\" to a female employee.  Many times I feel at least these two men and this whole \"crew\" of managers just stalk the small dining room creepily watching everyone.  I feel like I am being watched while trying to enjoy a meal.....More managers per square foot than any other place I have seen in my life.  I have rarely seen a manager at Yard House and if I do he is not skulking in a corner glaring at everyone like this \"Steve or Stevie\" person.  It has really put a damper on a couple of my visits and  am not sure when or if I will be returning if this is the business model of this place.  If you're a teenage girl, want to eat someplace that seems celebrity trendy, or want be stalked by a manger this is the place for you..."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience with the staff at the sugar factory with my girls. Bj and Louis was very attentive and apologetic after some hot sauce spilled.   The food was great. The drink was nice and strong .   The atmosphere was vibrant.  The music was really good. And the best part was I meet Gilles Marini!"}
{"text":"Me and my girls were really looking forward to this place! We arrived and ordered the rainbow sliders and 2 big \"goblet\" drinks for a little fun. The service was literally HORRIBLE. Don't go here! Save your time and money. Food is mediocre and drinks full of bullshit cheap liquor."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Vegas I had to go to the Sugar Factory. It was still at Paris then and it was one of the best dining experiences I have had! So obviously I would want to go back. And bonus, there was a Groupon!! Well now it has been moved to the mall across from the Wynn and almost impossible to find. I looked forward to this my whole trip because I have wanted a goblet since my first visit but have never gotten one. Now the reason for 1 star: We arrive at 4:50 on a Monday and we're promptly seated. After 8-10 min a waiter finally greeted us and let us know he was training the girl with him and would be back with waters. (There were only 3 in my party and we were 1 of 5 tables in the restaurant.) We get our waters and I order my goblet, my friends get tea and lemonade, no alcohol. At 5:25 the girl training comes and refills our water and I ask where are our drinks, she says sorry I'm not sure. I can see my goblet sitting on the bar, I get it may take awhile to make, but where is the tea and lemonade? Finally at 5:35 she comes back over (no drinks) and we let her know we are leaving and to tell the waiter training her that it is his fault. This was so ridiculously bad I thought I was being punked! So we took another cab back to Planet Hollywood and went to the Sugar Factory drink station and they were amazing! I contacted Groupon and got my money back, thank goodness! Moral of the story, save your time and money and go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Fun place, lots of duck paraphenalia, and celbrity photos.  Expect to pay top dollar  for candy, but you'll have fun doing it.  ($14/lb in the bulk bins)"}
{"text":"Visited your location in Las Vegas, NV Fashion Show Mall. I visited on 12/9/17. We were celebrating my friends 47th BD. Our waiter was named Chaz.  It was our first time experiencing the Sugar Factory. We asked our waiter a few general questions abt the signature  drinks in the goblet. For instance what did he recommend and how much. He  throughout a money amount of I think its 41.00 i'll be back. It took Chaz a long time to come back to the table. We had more questions abt more drinks and food. He answered as best as he could I guess. I'll be back. He disappeared once again leaving us hanging, he left us in total 3 times. In the interim we asked another waitress was he new because he appeared to be in a fog and didn't no what he was talking abt. She responded no he has been here quite sometime. We asked her how much were the goblet drink. She gave us a completely different amount. We asked the couple next to us who had Chaz also, how was he treating them with the service they were provided. They said he disappeared on them too and were waiting for him to come back to the table. He got their order wrong etc.  Upon arriving back to our table we asked him not to go anywhere, we were new to the experience, please don't disappear on us again and to be patient. When we proceeded to continue our questioning he would answer and talk to us like we were children and in a condenscending manner. There were what appeared to be 2 or 3 Managers standing around doing nothing but talking and laughing with one another. They were not walking around asking customers if everything is ok and do we need anything like good management do. May I add Chase was laughing and talking (sucking up) to them as well!!! Our experience was so awful it killed the rest of our evening. It was our last night in Vegas, we wanted to go out with a bang!!! And did we, we were so miserable when we left your establishnent we went back to the hotel and packed our luggage and went to sleep. We were to make one more stop but the experience sucked the life out of us. I had read all the negative reviews before going here, against my better judgement took a chance anyway. I see why all the negative reviews abt Management and some Employees. Instances like these will cause this location to suffer and eventually close down. I am surprised nothing hasn't been done abt it because of all the negative reviews on service, food etc. It needs a new vamping of mgmt, empl. I should had maybe tried the one in my hometown Illinois. By the way, we had drinks and food and it was a waste of money. Food mediocre not that good. And one of the drinks had to be sent back and replaced.  To date I have not heard from this establishment. I reported them to the BBB and they have not gotten an response as of jet. It's almost Feb. complaint was filed and reported incident to them Dec. Bad business from the top to the bottom.  REALLY!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok. It's way overpriced for the quality. Our server Justin was awesome! Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service was great and the food was awesome, their Campfire shake was amazing. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and my husband and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I DONT KNOW WHAT TO RATE THIS. BUT KEEP READING IF YOU JUST JUST A GOBLET!   we walked all the way over here for a goblet. The menu don't list how much the drinks are... which is a little weird.  Well goblets are $39. The other regular cocktails are $8  But be aware at this location YOU DONT GET TO KEEP the goblet!!!!!!!!!!! You have to pay an extra $15!!!! If you however go to the their other location you pay $39 and you get to keep the cup! But at the other location don't have have dry ice! At this location they gave dry ice and they make your drink all smoky and cool!!!   Other that that, the drinks are good. Sweet! But good! I got the watermelon mojito, it was delish!!! It had a ton of candy which is cute but really not necessary because we ended up throwing most away since we can't drink a lb of candy in one sitting. Good presentation tho!"}
{"text":"They have great deals on food with purchase of a cocktail!  The food is delicious and their sweets are what dreams are made of. The staff is super friendly and they know their menu from front to back.   You can always go to their candy shop but take advantage of their restaurant if you have some time to sip and dine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Sugar Factory for the first time yesterday and absolutely loved it! The service was amazing and so were the drinks and food! We purchased a Groupon for two duck daiquiris but we also wanted to try one of their goblets and it did not disappoint! I'm so glad that they also have a wide variety of non-alcoholic drinks. We had a Fuzzy Peach Penguin Mango goblet that was created by Pitbull and it was so delicious! We kept playing with the cute little penguin gummies lol as for food, we ordered the rainbow sliders and they were perfect! If you order an item on the menu that has a duck next to it, you get a free rubber duck which is so cute! I really wanted to try the Night Owl or The Drake goblet but they were sold out which just means we will have to come back again very soon! We will definitely go to Sugar Factory every time we're in Vegas! Oh and as for the duck daiquiris, they were so cute! We got compliments all night as we walked around with our ducks. We both had piña colada daiquiris which were super refreshing! Thank you, Sugar Factory!"}
{"text":"Great place, had the Sugar Factory Burger but the service here was outstanding definitely recommend server Matt to help you out. Definitely on top of his game, Thank you Matt"}
{"text":"So me and my brother came here a few weeks ago and it's such a cute place! Cailey the bartender was our server and she was so dang cute and bubbly and I absolutely love that in a server. She gave us great service and we were very happy with her. She had great suggestions for the drinks as well and she whipped up two different martins for my brother. A red velvet cake one and I don't quite remember what the other was. The food was pretty good. Not outstanding but I'm still overall happy with the experience. Thanks Cailey!"}
{"text":"Thank God this place is going to close soon.  It is the worst service, food and management I have ever seen.  The owner was at the location when we were there and he looked like a washed up trust fund 60 year old guy dressing like he was 16 and sat in a corner (with some dumb golf hat on, probably to cover his balding hair) for most of the time we were there.  He never visited a table or even talked to an employee or guest.  We asked the server about him and she said \"well, some people shouldn't own a restaurant\"  LOL   I AGREE We asked if all the Sugar Factory's are closing and she said \"No just us, we aren't a part of the other Sugar Factory\"  I asked around after we had been there and actually talked to me neighbor who works at another restaurant that a cook who works there used to work at that Sugar Factory and he said that this place was bouncing pay checks and they still owed him money along with a couple dozen other employees and that the owner had been apart of the Paris one but was kicked out for illegal activities.   He also said that they own so much money to distributers that they have to buy all the food at the grocery store.  That would explain the poor quality in food.   Latest; Don't spend a dime at this place. It goes into the owners pockets, he doesn't pay his employees (bad checks, missed hours etc) except his relatives that work there, he doesn't pay his distributers (owes almost $100K) and all the food is coming from Food 4 Less."}
{"text":"I love this place! Came here with my girlfriend and it's amazing! Got some burgers, goblet and a milkshake and all of it was great! Defiantly coming back!"}
{"text":"Our waiter Chaz was absolutely amazing!! He suggested the best items! He was super friendly, which made our our first experience wonderful. Super cool environment! Great music! I would recommend this restaurant to any hip, chic foodie!"}
{"text":"Food was good but our waitress barely stopped by our table and then didn't bring is all our change from a $143 bill. We figured the change could reflect in her tip.  My husband complained to the manager about our terrible service and keeping the change from our bill. The manager then followed us out to the walkway to bring us the change and tell us off for not tipping well enough. Tips are not and should not be expected! We are very good toppers when we get good service,  do your job well and you'll get paid accordingly! I will NOT return to this overpriced establishment."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and likely our last. This place is definitely more about the drinks & atmosphere. We were looking for a nice hearty, delicious lunch after donating blood and this certainly was not the place for that.  Everything was quite pricy on the menu, but the pictures looked amazing so we figured it was worth it. I ordered the big cheesy and my husband ordered the farmer, we both asked for well done on the burger. When they came out, they looked fairly decent, but with one bite, that changed. They were a frozen burger patty with a lot of fake smoke chargrilled flavor, very reminiscent of Burger King. My burger had macaroni and cheese on top, it was simply some Stouffer's frozen macaroni and cheese. My burger was cold as was the macaroni and cheese. My husband's burger was still bloody inside.  One thing I can say is that the service from Betty was superior, but the food was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"My friends and I contacted their Instagram account enquiring about a locals discount. With no delay they replied back and told us locals get 20% off! So that very night we decided to stop in to check it out and have dinner before our show. What a delight! Our server was very kind, our food was delicious, and the goblets are super fun. The manager even brought us out a giant rubber duck to take home! (although I have no clue where to put it)   In the end thank you for a wonderful night. We'll be spreading the word and I'll be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Love the decorations and the service. Food is always good and the goblets and milkshakes are probably the best"}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate my sons 21 st Birthday  It's really cool the sparklers with the ice cream dessert love the effect  What a super fun atmosphere  The waiter  Erick with a CK was very informative and gave great recommendations The food was fabulous and even down to the onion rings  You have to have the goblets amazing  I see why they're featured on TV and multiple celebrities visit this restaurant  Very pleased everyone had a good time in our party the place was packed that also speaks volumes on its popularity"}
{"text":"They have such amazing service. Very time we come with have an amazing waiter. The manager is very friendly. The food is so amazing it speaks for itself. My husband always gets the French toast and it comes with this amazing dark chocolate sauce. It is to die for. I got the fried egg sandwich with home fries. It is amazing as well. We also like to come during happy hour and get the pizza to go with our goblets. I love this place. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for good food anytime of day. They are also great for parties and groups. We try to come as often as we can."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Sugar Factory's candy cocktails so I was happy to see a full service Sugar Factory was coming back to the Strip at the Fashion Show.  The opening date kept getting pushed back but now the downstairs at least is finally open.  Upstairs is a Chocolate Lounge that is coming soon.    We wanted to sit at the bar for happy hour but it was full.  We were offered 2 for 1 goblets if we sat at a table.  We took them up on it but that was a mistake.  Our server wouldn't let us keep a menu at the table and rushed us out before we finished our first round.  We planned on having more drinks but ended up just leaving.  Drinks were good but I prefer the small cocktails to the goblets.  Next time I will sit at the bar where hopefully we will get better service."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear that this place reopened!  I went on Easter weekend with a large group.  Our server was Rhea and she was phenomenal!  My group was about 15 lovely frilly people and she was very kind and attentive to us.  Our food was great!  I ordered the white chocolate burger which sounds strange, but it was actually really good!  It's messy but it's the perfect hint of sweetness to the savory flavor of the well seasoned angus beef patty.  Their portions are gigantic!  The goblets are enough to serve six people and the presentation is quite a sight!  The rainbow donut ice cream sandwich was different from what I expected since it's served sandwiched between two sugar cookies rather than donuts.  The Sexual Chocolate cocktail is delicious, but quite strong!  I will definitely be back again in the future to hang out in the Chocolate Lounge upstairs."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my hubby whilst in vacation in Vegas.  We started by having one of the goblet cocktails whilst sat outside before our reservation,  the bar man was great really fun to chat with wish I could remember his name, he was from Bosnia though.   We moved inside for our meal, hubby had the NY strip and me a turkey burger, I also had the Lemon head martini which was very good.  Food wise it wasn't the best meal I'd ever had but not the worst either.  I wished I had room for one of the crazy sundies or milkshakes as I think that's probably where they shine.  Crissy our server was just lovely and we liked her a lot."}
{"text":"So sad I hear they are going to close all of the Sugar Factory's! I go every time we go to Vegas and we buy a lot of stuff and candy, we just love this place it's for grown ups!  I had my last birthday there when my son took me, we had lunch the best pasta I had to let the chief it was the best dam carbonara not sure of the spelling?  We had drinks they gave me my drink free for my birthday that was an extra added bonus.  Every time we go to Vegas we make it a stop no matter what we have to go there but now they are not going to be there?  I wanted to try to get there one last time."}
{"text":"Brought the family for dinner and was a little disappointed. Had the grilled chicken sandwich with french fries, standard waffle, cheeseburger and steak respectfully. Steak was bland, chicken sandwich was decent, waffle was decent, burger was good but the fries were way too salty. The biggest problem I had was the music...EDM crap that was way too loud! I just didn't understand why I had to listen to dubstep while I ate. Then again the girl next to us, who looked like she been in the tanning bed way way too long, was feeling the drop. I'll pass on the skrillex burgers..."}
{"text":"Everyone was so nice the drinks are liquid gold the milkshakes are fun and delicious and the food is amazimg definitely worth stopping in 10/10"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend and for the hype it was just OK - I'm really big on photo-ops so that was a plus...the store is really fun and creative looking, however it's a huge waste of $$. The goblets is what they are known for, but they are so sugary and priced super high at $38. My friend and I were going to split one, but unfortunately had different tastes. Luckily, I'll be back this weekend so I want to give it another shot...just wish the goblets were priced at maybe $20 less then I'd consider reordering. I haven't heard great things about the food either, but the service was great and store is really fun."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for lunch and we had exceptional service the entire time!! Our waiter was Travis was so fun. Several employees and managers came around and everyone continued to ask what was needed. Brad was amazing, dimmed the lights, put on all the single ladies, and brought out some special sweets with fireworks! Total surprise! I have not had such great service and food in awhile!"}
{"text":"Poor Service & Drinks were 40$ and had barely any alcohol. Food was decent ... cool for a picture but, not much else."}
{"text":"This place has very pretty food, and aesthetically pleasing desserts.  We got a cool deal where it was a BOGO apps. We also got two drinks, and it bubbled. The thing about the goblet drink is that is pretty pricey...It is a nice show, but I think most of the goblet you are paying for is the dry ice that makes it bubble and fog.  The food is good, but they also discontinued the pizza but that was still pictured on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here on Memorial Day around 6 pm and the restaurant wasn't busy or anything. I wanted to order the burger sliders with the colorful buns, but was told they ran out. We ended up ordering what I think was something like popcorn shrimp. It was alright, nothing amazing, have definitely had better elsewhere for cheaper. I ended up ordering a goblet. The goblet was amazing. I almost drank the whole thing by myself but barely got buzzed though and I'm someone who rarely drinks so if you're looking to get turnt then I wouldn't suggest spending that much money on a goblet. We wanted dessert so we ordered a brownie ice cream thing, I don't remember what it's called. We were then told they were out of brownies (shocker) but that they could substitute the brownie with a cookie. We were down because the lady said she would make it really special for us. Yeah...no. The cookie was basically concrete. We couldn't even eat it. I was genuinely scared of chipping a tooth trying to bite the cookie. It was ridiculous. The service wasn't great. The only friendly person we encountered was the guy outside leading people inside. Two stars- one for the cool dude outside and one for the good tasting goblet."}
{"text":"I went with my friend the other night and I really enjoyed it. We sat outside but it was still really warm next to the heaters. Our server was Brandon D. While he was very attractive the service we received was awesome as well. Every question we had was answered and I thoroughly enjoyed the goblet I had, the passion fruit punch was so yummy! The only downside to the place is how pricey it is for the amount of food you get. I got the Chinese chicken salad for 14$ and while it was good, it could have been larger. All in all, I enjoyed sugar factory at town square very much! Wouldn't mind going back just to see Brandon ;) haha."}
{"text":"Food portions here small for the price. The Goblet drinks were super fun to have. Our dinner experience started off rough due to a rude host. The restaurant was nearly empty (went on a Tuesday evening around 7) and I requested a more private booth area. He wouldn't let us sit there because it was only for parties of 5.... but the place was empty. It stayed fairly empty until we finished the meal and left. He could have sat me and my party at a circle booth and there still would have been plenty of seating for incoming guests. I mentioned on the reservation note that this was my birthday dinner and he didn't seem to care at all. I asked several times if we could just sit one table over and he was like no you can just move your tables here. Gave up after that. Didn't even bring out a dessert at the end. The table next to us had a birthday too and they got one. Best part of my dinner experience was the kind server, Pablo. He was open to answering all my questions about the menu and was super friendly. The menu here is vegetarian and vegan friendly. They have \"v\" next to all the items that can be veganized.  Overall the drinks and milkshakes here are worth it since they have nice presentation. Might be better to eat elsewhere and come here after for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"We went here for my husband's birthday in December with a group of our friends.  I have been to their other location at the Paris Las Vegas and the experience was always pretty good.  The server at first was really nice and promised to be accommodating and even promised that the food once we ordered would be out fast.  She even said that she would split our bills (which is unheard of when you have a large party).  The dinner looked promising.  We arrived right before 7:00pm.  We didn't get out of there until almost 10:00pm.    We ordered our drinks, or at least attempted to.  She only asked 3/4 of the table for drinks.  Then was a smart ass and scolded our friends that she didn't ask for their drink order, rolled her eyes, gave them the \"one minute finger\" and then came around to ask for their drinks.  50 minutes later and after asking her twice and another server for their beers they finally got them.  Our one friend was only stopping by to have a drink before he had to go to another event.  By the time the beer came, he could not drink it because he had to drive.  Meanwhile, we had also given her our appetizer order and were still waiting for those.    Finally the apps came and then slowly, but surely the entrees came.  It was about 9:15pm by the time we got all the food.  My friend's dad actually called one of the suits walking around several times to complain about the service and they graciously took off the appetizers and tried to smooth things over with gift cards.  He told them that it was my husband's birthday and they didn't acknowledge it.  I don't expect anything extra for saying it's someone's birthday except if I know it's a guest's birthday, I say \"Happy Birthday!\"   Even though I have a gift card to here, I do not think I will use it.  I do not want to go back."}
{"text":"this place is super cute inside!! Beautiful setting with a hip atmosphere. Perfect for groups or even date night . Plus creative food & drinks too. PRICEY $$$ But worth it."}
{"text":"The sugar factory itself has a nice concept, as well as service, and is even located just outside of the fashion show mall. However, I must say that once the food arrived, my family and I were disappointed to see the very small portion of the crepes we ordered. The worse part was not only the size of our servings, but the price of it. Every item on the menu was SUPER pricey, even for the smallest portions. I highly recommend that you shouldn't come here, especially when your on a budget. Overall, the food at The Sugar Factory is very disappointing, when you consider the price. Unfortunately, it's just a giant rip-off."}
{"text":"Awesome service. The lollipop martini is delicious! We had an easy time finding vegan options which says a lot. Half price drinks on happy hour means you can try lots of things. :) we will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment! My daughter has been wanting to come here for 2 years to get the huge goblet drink. We ordered the Lollipop Goblet, one of their most popular, and the waitress said sorry we are out of those, so we ordered the Watermelon Patch and asked if we could get the lollipops in that one since they were out of the drink, sure for another $8.00. This drink was completely full of dry ice and hardly any alcohol,  it had so much ice we could barely get our straws in it. It ended up costing us $46.00! Now we ordered the Rainbow Sliders and a salad for lunch, the sliders cost $24.00 and the salad was $19.00 with hardly anything on it. The sliders were barely warm and had no taste. Since we drove 3 hours to come here we wanted to have dessert of course! We got a sundae the triple chocolate one, now I have to say it was wonderful but not worth $16.00!  Now we had assumed for $46.00 a drink you would get to keep the glass, wrong!! The glass was an extra $15.00, so since this was her #1 reason for wanting to come here I bought her the glass. When I asked the waitress if we could get a clean one since this was still full of dry ice and candy she said no, it will be an extra $10.00. I about flipped out at this point, I said surely you can dump out the glass because we can't take it like this, and she said well I  don't so, I told her to go find out that there should be no reason they can't do that. She then came back with a clean one.  The waitress was not attentive to us at all, first of all the presentation of pouring the drink is a big deal, and I had gone to the restroom quickly, when I returned she had already poured it, she couldn't wait 1 minute for me to return and there was only 1 other table with people in there. She never came by and asked it we needed condiments or water the whole time we were there. Now to top it all off when we left a girl was sitting at the outside bar drinking a Lollipop Goblet!! So they were not out of them!! This small lunch venture costs us $150.00. I will never go back it is a huge rip off!!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend wish I read the reviews before coming. Server was rude every meal was extremely mediocre and overpriced. Mac n cheese burger came with like no Mac n cheese, one dish came thirty min later than everyone else's. Waste of time and money when there are so many yummy places to eat on the strip"}
{"text":"So we came for dessert very disappointed we got the fondue for two it was $20 you get a little bowl of chocolate 7 little sides the brownies were hard like they were sitting out all day the marshmallows were also hard the red velvet was under cooked.  We did mention it to the server (matt) and he was very nice about it the manager also came over and offered other sides but we were full from dinner.  They did give us 50% off  which was nice and respectful but unfortunately the dessert was just a  disappointing."}
{"text":"I've visited sugar factory at town square a few times now and each experience has been excellent. The food is always delicious and beautifully presented, the service impeccable, and the atmosphere is always so fun! I especially give a big thumbs up to my favorite yummy drink, the gummy bear goblet. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or local :) perfect for a girls night or date night!"}
{"text":"The decor in here is so cute and  I love the creative thinking going on, what a million dollar idea. However, the food is alright. It's not bad it's just okay. Adding on, I was really excited to try their cupcakes knowing that that the whole place is candy-store inspired. Sadly, the cupcakes did not live up to my expectations. I would have rather gone to a bakery close to my house then spend 12 dollars on a cupcake. OH WELL."}
{"text":"Usually go here for just \"drinks\"... but decided to go on my birthday.. we found not one but hair twice this day. One was in one of the lollipops in one of the drinks we ordered. The other was in the little \"birthday\" rice crispy treat they give you for $10 (not worth it lol) and when it was time to pay, we weren't charged for the rice crispy or the drink with the hair but instead they charged us for something extra that we didn't even order, but we didn't notice until after paying for the whole bill."}
{"text":"Manny was our waiter and was awesome and deserves 5 stars! We really enjoyed the atmosphere there and the special drinks. The food I'd give 3 stars. It was mediocre but to be honest all the food we had in Vegas this trip was mediocre."}
{"text":"Amazing fooooooooooddddddd.... too bad I was in a hurry I couldn't enjoy this place the way I wanted to . I had the sugar daddy shake which was soo good . My friends ordered the rainbow burger which was pretty damn good when it was warm . My friends loved the other stuff they ordered too. The menu options are definitely cute and creative . I loved the restaraunt decor as well. I wish to return to the l.a location near me soon ."}
{"text":"Alcohol + sugar + sugar.  They most make some sweet cocktails, it's not totally my thing, but the vibe is kind of neat.  The staff is super friendly.  If you ask, they can make the drinks less sweet.  Happy hour all day monday brings the prices into the reasonable range.  Small beer selection (4 or 5 drafts I think?)"}
{"text":"Preshow meal turned into an unexpected gem. Location with a view of the Bellagio fountains and a super friendly staff. Just wish the preshow menu wasn't so constricted."}
{"text":"My review is for the candy shop only. The candy shop is very small with ice cream, rubber ducks, stuffed animals, lollipops and more. Very clean which was impressive. They also sale cotton candy $5 and make it right in front of you, that's my kids favorite thing."}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette dinner here yesterday and 5 of us used to be servers. I have never had service from a waiter that horrible in my life. His attitude was terrible. One thing he said to the bride was \"one man can't do everything\" and she said \"well my fiancé is doing just fine\"....he was sooooo rude with everything, very negative! His name supposedly was Manny (he was a short black/maybe Dominican guy) very rude. It was my first time there and I stayed quiet because I didn't want him saying anything rude to me and I have to snap on him. Anyway, food was good though. He just gave negative vibes the entire time. Closing out was super sketchy too because we totaled everything exact including tax and 18% gratuity that he honestly shouldn't have gotten, yet somehow it came up short and he said \"don't worry, I'll get the rest\" and disappeared after that. Very very weird...and we as servers didn't find that to be normal. They really need to get rid of the bad apples in there because obviously there's service issues from previous reviews."}
{"text":"We went here because we bought the Groupon. The food was only mediocre... definitely not up to Vegas standards. We ordered a burger and it came out completely wrong but they corrected it and made a new one. It was very empty. The drinks were a fun experience but they didn't have much alcohol in them. We would not visit here again in Vegas..."}
{"text":"The drinks were amazing and so was our waiter Ronnie! Te food and things took quite a while to come out even though it wasn't busy and the staff seemed a bit confused on who ordered what at times but none of that really made our experience any less wonderful. Their half price happy hour was nice as it was and they took the yelp coupon  for 50% of that which I figured they wouldn't do. Overall awesome experience."}
{"text":"I truly had an amazing time, Nikki, our waitress was very polite & kept up with our demands. I can honestly say we are pretty needy but she was definitely able to keep up with our high maintenance. I will be coming back for her service once again. Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I can't give a review on the food, because I only had a drink here. The ambience is a little dark, only our faces were highlighted. I kept thinking, \"does my nose look shiny?\" (the things you think about in poor lighting). Anyway, I had a nice chocolatey drink that was very tasty. I'm not sure if I would return, because there is so much competition on The Strip, but it is definitely a nice place to get together on a \"girl's trip\"."}
{"text":"First and foremost the service was great. We were seated promptly at the table of our choice. Then were greatest by a very delightful waitress.  The drinks were good as the usually are. Our food came out quickly. The food was ok. Nothing to really brag about. Then desserts were amazing.   Not a bad date spot for Music, drinks, and desserts."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place. Had the fish bowl and the colorful burger patties that tasted way better that what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I came here during the week and it was pretty dead. I was surprised because they have a pretty good happy hour with 50% off drink until close. We just came for drinks and sat at the bar. The bartender was good but a bit of an over sharer. I think he opened with the fact that he was hungover. I got one of the goblets and it was delicious. They are exciting to drink with the dry ice and candy. I probably wouldn't come here regularly but I would definitely bring people when they are in town. I came here with my brother and the bartender ended up giving us his drink free, so that was very nice."}
{"text":"This place is absurdly expensive for food that's picturesque, but not very tasty. I had the mixed berry crepe, fried ice cream and a non alcoholic goblet drink. It was $70. The crepe was old and hard, the fried ice cream was the worst I've ever had. It was all very pretty though, so I guess I just paid for pictures of food. It was also so much sugar, I'm sick now. The goblet drinks look cool, and can be shared by 3 people easily. 40$ for alcoholic ones (about 7 shots worth of liquor), 35$ for virgin. It's way too much for too little. The atmosphere is really tacky, they advertise all the celebrities who have been there on every screen in the place, and the menus. I recommend going with friends, split the cost of a drink, get your pictures and leave."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriends came in for a quick dessert to end the night during my bachelorette party. Erick was our waiter and did such a great job. If you're in the area and looking for delicious ice cream, energetic and great customer service come here and ask for Erick!"}
{"text":"We dined at the bar for Mother's Day. The club sandwich and chinese chicken salad were both great!  Food service seemed a little off, not sure if it was because of the amount of people or what... It appeared that a lot of upper management were in observing...staff seemed nervous.  The only thing that saved this review is the amazing bar service and food recommendations by Scott!  He made great drinks and was on top of everything! Will come back just to see him."}
{"text":"Food is very good. Have been here a few times and the service is lacking every time. They are very slow and made mistakes throughout our visit. Hopefully they can get it together. Soon!!"}
{"text":"Diane C. is the worst server ever. We waited for a while to be acknowledged. Table next to us got seated 10 mins after us and were approached by server first. Then she assumed we were with the other table and asking \"Are you guys the one using groupon?\". When she was done taking their orders she left, we waited a bit for her to come back just to take our drink order. She brought our drinks and left again. Then came back to take our order. While enjoying our meal my daughter was looking for the rubber duckie that is supposed to come with her burger sliders. When server came around passing by, my daughter asked her if they forgot to give her the rubber duckie. The server immediately said \"we dont have it, if you want you can speak to the manager\". Long story short, After meals & drinks, we were going to order dessert when server approached us to take the order my daughter asked her if there is anything they have because we are celebrating my birthday. The server rudely said \"if you are not ordering any dessert then we don't have anything\". At this point I was already aggravated, and told my daughter we will not be having dessert anymore because of the way we have been treated. She could have nicely said it being that she is speaking to a 10 years old. Then on top of it all, upon paying our bill she was really rude how she shoved the receipt in my purse after I asked for it.   ---I can understand the attitude or rudeness if they were slam busy but they were not even busy.  --- She did not have to shove the receipt in my purse there is a proper way of handing the receipt to a paying customer."}
{"text":"The food was terrible,but the milkshake was delicious.Interesting drink menu.Service was not very good"}
{"text":"Pretty great sundaes.  They are expen$ive.  But the s'mores and  caramel cheesecake shakes.  Shake that ass!"}
{"text":"Used a Groupon which was misleading.  We were told pay 30 for 60 worth of food which included all you can drink mimosas and bloody Marys for two.  Turns out that the unlimited drinks was 20 per perso, leaving only 10 worth of food per person. We wouldn't have ordered as much food if we knew that.  Took us about 15 minutes to get a high chair after asking 3 people.  For unlimited drinks they were very slow and watered down. Not worth 20 each. The food was good but service wasn't great. Also the wifi didn't work at all."}
{"text":"Giving three stars really disappoints me after this much anticipated visit. When we were in Vegas last year, the Sugar Factory restaurants were closed. We were able to get one of the goblet drinks at their location in the Miracle Mile. When planning our trip for this year, I was delighted to discover the restaurant had opened in the Fashion Mall. We arrived at 9:45pm on a Tuesday night. There weren't many other patrons, but there was a table of about fifteen teenagers celebrating a birthday. They were really loud and rambunctious, but we didn't mind. Their energy was contagious and went well with the music blasting from the speakers. Yes, blasting! Don't expect to have a nice, dinner conversation when you're here. Our waitress promptly brought over menus. Excuse me. I should have said' \"extensive menu\", but I'm not complaining. Pages and pages of mouthwatering drinks and delectable desserts. I finally decided on the fried seafood platter and the sour apple lolly martini. The drink was great. The entree not so much. Basic seafood from a frozen box most likely. At least that's what it tasted like. They were out of the dessert we wanted to try so the waitress had them make us a customized sundae. Now that sundae was an absolute yummy treat. The best part of the visit. Our waitress was very attentive also. Almost to the point that I wanted to ask her to stop coming to the table so often. Seriously, whenever we were about to start talking, she would show up. Overall, not the great experience I wanted from this much anticipated visit."}
{"text":"Overall this restaurant is great. The menu is thick of options ranging from crafted cocktails to juicy steaks and fresh salads.  The venue is similar to a French bistro. Very open yet intimate. Diners have the option to sit on the patio, in restaurant or at the bar.  We ordered artichoke dip for appetizer, a steak and salmon salad for lunch and shared a milkshake for dessert. Dip- it's a generous portion but you're going to need more crustini. Ask for more! Steak- order your cooked preference 1 degree higher. We typically like our meats at medium- rare, but it will cone out bleeding. Their medium-rare is a true rare. Comes with a huge bowl of potatoes and asparagus.  Salmon salad- Salmon is cooked deliciously and Romain is tossed in a sherry dressing. Nice and light for a warm day. Milkshake- amazing! Rich and large enough to share. There are so many options but we ordered the very berry."}
{"text":"First let me start off by saying I work in the restaurant business and this place definitely knows how a restaurant should be run. SUNDAY BRUNCH is where it's at!!!! Not only is the food delicious but the drinks are fun unlike any other restaurant. It is nice as a local not to have to drive to the strip to have a Las Vegas experience which is why it is our girlfriend's first choice for her bachelorette party."}
{"text":"Food was incredibly bland and overpriced... dessert was good but prob won't ever go back"}
{"text":"decided to try out sugar factory in vegas after a good experience at the sugar factory in nyc. Ordered a pumpkin spice latte , it was very sweet and small. Isn't worth the money. Also got the apple pie waffles which were very delicious and the mixed berry crepes. Both were great."}
{"text":"I saw this place a couple of times and figured I would take my family out for a great night, Scott the bartender and Lauren the waitress absolutely made our night spectacular! Couldn't be happier with their customer service!!! They treated us like royalty! haha. My family has never been to Sugar Factory before, and they couldn't stop talking about how much they loved the place. The manager came over as well and checked to see how we were doing. Very friendly and courteous. Food was delicious and fresh. Overall and epic night! Thank you guys so much. I will be bring more people to come eat at your restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you wanna take an Instagram picture with your drink and that's about it. My friend and I ordered the night owl goblet (non alcoholic since we're 18) and it didn't even have the owl lollipops that the menu promises. But that's no big deal (we didn't care but thought they'd be cool). The drink tasted like diabetes but that was expected considering all the sugar. My mom got the berry goblet. In the picture it had fresh berries and the actual drink was candy. No big deal though. But for a drink that large that costs $35 she should at least get a buzz. She hadn't had a drink for two months prior, so her alcohol tolerance was low. Considering she couldn't even taste the liquor, I wouldn't be surprised if hers was non alcoholic as well. The most surprising part for me was that it was only $5 extra for alcohol in the drinks. They should lower the price on the nonalcoholic drinks if they're just fruit punch in a cool cup. The thing that caused this place to lose stars for me was that we asked four different people for a to go cup. And the food sucks. $100 for two drinks and an appetizer. Spend your money somewhere elsewhere, maybe nobu or maggianos if you want some actual good food."}
{"text":"I guess I should've yelped this location before actually buying the Groupon.  I'm not a fussy yelper and if I have a great experience I always give 5 stars, but for this particular time I can only give 3 stars.  We actually went to Town Square to use this Groupon while visiting Vegas.  We got there a little early so they weren't open yet, so we did a little shopping first.  When we got to the restaurant it was of course empty so we were seated and greeted right away.  Everyone was great.  Customer service was awesome.  Now the food on the other hand...my sister ordered sliders and a side of fries and I ordered a pizza with mushrooms and black olives.  We got our drinks pretty fast...but the food was another thing.  The restaurant was dead, at most there were 4 tables occupied.  So when it took 30 minutes for the food to come out, it was a bit disappointing.  I understand that it takes a while to cook the pizza, but not 30 minutes.  Needless to say we were hungry by the time the food came out.  The food looked great when it was put onto the table.  So I grabbed a slice of pizza and put it on my daughter's plate, then I grabbed a slice for myself.  It was a thin crust pizza, which was soaked in tomato sauce.  I could only eat one slice because of how soggy it was.  So I ended up eating one of my sister's sliders.  I don't know if it was because I was hungry or if the slider was actually that good...lol  I should've said something about the pizza, but i'm pretty sure that I won't be going back to that location anytime soon.  I also didn't want to wait for them to make me something else when I was hungry.  My advice would be to only go there for drinks and pupu's, which i'm pretty sure they can't mess up."}
{"text":"Coming back for their waffles!! Serves the cutest drinks but I wish I could have gotten a hot drink with my waffle. Couldn't pass on the eye candy."}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out after ordering. They can make such exotic drinks yet are unable to provide a simple glass of wine."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with our experience a few nights ago. My husband and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and was hoping to have a fun night because we rarely have time for date nights between our busy schedules. I asked the hostess if we can go sit outside and she said yes and she would send a server out to us. We are very patient people but sat there for more than 30 minutes and no one even came to greet us. We almost walked out until my husband flagged down a server. We stuck it out to make the most of it because it was our anniversary but I don't think we will ever go back again because of the service alone."}
{"text":"I've always liked sugar factory, food hits the spot and drinks are always fun. This review is for the service in this location. I ordered salmon and after I ate the outer edges, the inside was completely raw when I ordered medium. As I was picking through it, our waiter came by and said \"Oh wow, That's pretty raw\" and offered to redo the plate and after I declined since I ate most of it anyway, he offered another drink. I accepted. I didn't even tell him or make a notion of being bothered by the dish. That's amazing customer service. Within 5 seconds of agreeing to another drink, the manager came by, apologized, and went out of their way to make everything right. I've never experienced that type of prompt customer service. Amazing! Again, I want to emphasize that I didn't even have to draw attention to the incorrect order! Will definitely be coming back to this location again :)"}
{"text":"I loved my first dining experience here. Friendly staff and the drinks were amazing. I didn't get try any of the flavored \"smoking\" cocktails that Sugar Factory is known for but simply had a few margaritas and my daughters experienced a massive milkshake... birthday cake flavor. Also ordered a grilled chicken entree which was a perfect portion size and tasty. We will return!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to eat here. The decor is really cute and the food menu broad and tasty looking. Unfortunately my meal here was ruined by horrible service. I'm here early on Thursday (only a few other tables worth people) and waited 15 min for a waiter to even acknowledge us. We immediately ordered including drinks. 20+ min later food arrives- still no drinks. Shouldn't you get your cocktail before your foodI ask the food runner to check on drinks which arrive another 10 min. later with he excuse that the bar is backed up. Really? No one is here... I'd hate to see the bar on a busy night. Also I could see the bar where I was sitting and my drink had been just sitting there for who knows how long- the cotton candy topper had melted and I watched he waiter put on a new one with his hands which he didn't wash. Food was nothing special. Do yourself a favor and skip this place for one of the many many other options on the strip.  Update- much like their cocktail service  the direct message from the management's comment below never came...."}
{"text":"The experience at the sugar factory started off rocky because they cooked my order wrong but server was superb she was so patient and nice. After my order was corrected everything was great. The drinks was amazing I advise to try all the drinks."}
{"text":"We're standing outside 30 minutes before close and they locked the doors! Come on stop being lazy. The workers just looked at us and shrugged. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful breakfast today. Yelp steered us here.  Though we are quite the coffee snobs and might usually walk in with our own discriminating cup, we found the coffee exceptional! ...Accompanied by eggs Benedict and granola crusted French toast.  We sat outside on the Vegas strip and the entire experience was great."}
{"text":"Went this week and very great service very pleasant host and servers !!!! Food was great and drinks were awesome"}
{"text":"This is the greatest service I have ever had from ANY restaurant/bar in Las Vegas. Our waitress, Monique, went above and beyond to ensure that our experience was amazing!  We had, incorrectly, thought that this place closed at 1:00 a.m. and when we were told otherwise, two of the staff assured us that they were staying open until we were ready to leave.   Also, the drinks are AMAZING!!! I'm a Jack Daniels girl usually and I ordered the Grape Crush cocktail instead. So good!!!  I enjoyed this location much more than the one on the Strip. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is good and the drinks are wonderful! Q was out server and he was super friendly. I will definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Fun food but AWFUL SERVICE our meals took forever to make it to the table and the waitress mite as well been none existent. Definitely not worth the 40min wait to get a table (when there was empty tables everywhere)"}
{"text":"Good spot for sweet drinks. Had a groupon so we stopped in after a walk down the strip. I got the cheeseburger bacon milkshake $19 and he got the alcoholic smores $29. Both were very tasty! Worth going for the experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service, incredibly loud music, over priced drinks, and terrible food!!! The food is like a bad cafeteria. Worst turkey club I have ever had in my life. Had three different waiters who knew nothing about the menu and were quite annoying. Oh and the bathrooms were broken and they were out of milk shakes, pizza, and several other sides. What a joke. I took my seven year old nephew and luckily he liked the the thirty dollar candy drink he had. Bad bad bad experience.  Was contacted by management to atone for their subpar performance and when I reached out to bring my mom I was never contacted again. Wow! Lived in town for 15 years was a concierge for7 years. I have never been to a more mismanaged restaurant on the strip. It is the Chuck E Cheese of Las Vegas Boulevard. Don't waste your time go to a real establishment."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful! The interior is so modern and trendy! I felt like a celebrity walking in! We were walking around the fashion show looking for a drink and decided to stop and get one of the famous goblets! We came in through the outside entrance and were greeted by a friendly hostess. I was waiting for my friend to return from the restroom and I was very indecisive about where I wanted to sit but everybody there was very friendly and accommodating! I asked to look at the menu so I could decide which goblet I wanted. There's a flavor for anybody and everybody! I love the idea of the candy shop in the restaurant and picking the candies you want in your drinks or desserts. This place is a fountain of fun for the eye. The colors and candies everywhere makes you feel like how Charlie must have felt in the chocolate factory. We decided on the Drake! It was peachy and delicious with sweet tea and cotton candy! The videos do it more justice than my words can. Well it's a little pricey you pay for the whole show and experience you get when you dine here. I need to come back and try food and I sure will."}
{"text":"Initially, I was really excited to spend Valentine's dinner here with my honey; however, I cannot think of one thing I liked about this place.    1. The food was less than mediocre with numerous mistakes from the kitchen.   2. Their fondue (a big reason for why we came) was terrible - poor quality chocolate, old accompaniments.  3. The servers were delivering plates to the wrong tables. 4. The atmosphere was confused, resembling what I can only describe as a cafeteria/nightclub.  I normally don't have such harsh judgements, but this place was really that bad.  My review is not just based on our night at the Sugar Factory, but what those around us were experiencing as well.  With the quality of service and food being less than par, unfortunately I will not be returning.  I really hope this poor experience is only true for their Town Square location.  Maybe their Strip location is better.    I will say that I did not get to experience one of their goblet drinks (which are HUGE).  I would consider going to their Strip location for drinks at the bar."}
{"text":"They had a large line which is usually a good sign. We ordered two regular shakes which came to over $20. The shakes were much much smaller then you would expect for the price they charge. Once we got the shakes they were good but not nearly as good as other shakes we have had. Long line, expensive items and not the best I've ever had. Would looks for another option next time."}
{"text":"Came back with 2 of my good Friends for some drinks with dessert! The vibe this time was great! To start my drink on I ordered the Blow Pop Martini (12$) the ream had pop rock candy so you can already imagine all the popping going inside your mouth:)  Well for dessert I was scared to order red velvet since last time i came here it was super dry and left disappointed, so I decided to go ahead and order a slice of red velvet cake (8$) and I loved it! It was moist and had a really good cheese cake filling ( hands down!) I like it there I still need to come back and try those goblets! :s"}
{"text":"A complete 360 from my first experience.   We were seated right away and greeted as we walked in.   Our party started with four people, then moved to seven. Luckily we made it work and made more room in our booth for the extra people.  We all started with a round of drinks and one calamari appetizer.  Calamari was fried to perfection and very well seasoned.  For the first time I decided to try a different flavor in their signature Goblet's. Went for the Raspberry Watermelon mint Mojito and it was very refreshing. But my favorite is still their Lollipop Goblet.   For the entrees, we had the Steak Bearnaise, Fried Sea food platter, Chicken Satay and two orders of the Pacific Salmon.  I had the Salmon and it was definitely my favorite entree. The salmon was not over cooked, very well seasoned and the asparagus and capers made the whole dish come together. I highly recommend this entree if you're a fan of salmon.  Seafood platter was really good and it came with multiple sauces to dip in, or I am not sure if my boyfriend just order a variety of them on the side.  My best friend had the Steak Bearnaise and she devour it. I am going to take a wild guess and say she enjoyed it. LOL We wanted to do dessert but unfortunately our tummy's said \"no\". Probably was a good thing since we were drinking.   Over all, I am so glad I came back and gave them another chance. All my friends had so much fun and truly enjoyed their dining experience.  Our servers name was Jason and he was great. Very attentive, patient and polite.   FYI, this place is perfect for Birthdays, special occasions or just a fun night out."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sugar factory in America        our waitress Carla made my every experience full of joy. The city view strip of the city is more then enough bit the fried chicken and waffles and the lollipop goblet was every bit of amazing.... Stop by the sugar factory ... you will enjoy the service and the meal tell them glowing star media sent you"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to having lunch at Sugar Factory this morning because I've waited since last year for them to finally open. From the reviews I knew beforehand that it was going to be pricey but I couldn't get my mind off of their Goblet drinks! Anyways, I was there earlier this morning for lunch and the service is what is giving the review two stars. Our server and the other workers around were very attentive and polite. The reason I'm knocking off 3 stars is because I found a hair in my ultimate veggie burger. The manager did speak to me and ask if I wanted anything else but after I basically ate half a stand of hair my appetite was gone. She apologized for the issue and we went on to get our bill from our server. We asked for a discount because of the hair and our server gave us 75% off of my burger. I personally thought my meal should have not been charged at all but I didn't want to speak to anyone and my sister was dealing with the check. Obviously I could have asked to get my meal removed from the check but I wanted to get out of there so I can't blame them for that. I probably won't be back because it was embarrassing and disgusting having to deal with that.      Also, the hair is on the side of the plate in the picture I provided because my sister pulled it out of the burger to make sure it wasn't any strand from the leafy greens that was inside."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The service is terrible. We got sat outside, ignored for 15 minutes where I had to go up to the host and ask if we had a server. Then this stupid server  comes up and sits down water. Continued to ignore us. The manager came over and said he would take care of us. We ordered 2 drinks, and an appetizer. Everything seemed to be going good, until we went to order our entree. He said the kitchen was closed, but failed to tell us that when we ordered before. Said he would take care of the drinks, and then refused to.this place is terrible. They have horrible service. Do not come here, unless you like being treated like crap and less then human. Do NOT come here!! Go to the one on the strip inside Paris casino."}
{"text":"Chocolate and drink specialty. We skipped the $40 big goblets and decided to try a peanut butter chocolate and chocolate strawberry drink instead. They were strong and flavorful. We ordered and omelet and fettuccini alfredo. It did take a little while for us to be waited on and for the food to come out. The food was decent and priced similar to other areas. Drinks were about $15 each so a little pricey. The potatoes that came with the omelet were nice and crispy and the pasta was cooked to my liking. The menu was slightly different than what's online. No pizza or chocolate lava cake, both what I was going to order"}
{"text":"The best part of this place was seeing our old friends! Had drinks, entree and dessert. Loved my lemonhead martini, nothing else!"}
{"text":"So went w fam last night.   Service was a bit slow and very inattentive.   Was decent, burgers are good quality.  Fries were a bit soggy.  We waited a while for water and soda refills, salt and napkins.  Server didn't bother to ask how our food was.  Here is my biggest beef w the place:  I asked for bacon on my burger - it cost 4 dollars for a 14 dollar burger... Stupid expensive for just bacon on a burger.  The burgers were good but not worth 18 dollars plus tax.  Safe to say IF we go back we won't be adding bacon to our burgers.  And get a living social deal to save 10 bucks on your meal.  The groupon deal is very restrictive."}
{"text":"Great place food and drinks where good awesome experience great service when you go ask for Scott to serve you"}
{"text":"We were seated at the outside bar because they were full and we didn't want to wait once we sat down the bartender let us know that he wouldn't be able to make those white fog or smoke come up from the drinks because we were outside. We were disappointed at first but the bartender was so sweet he made the yummiest drinks and made up for it! The drinks were still so pretty to look at i forgot about the fog I was looking forward to and enjoyed my time there. My friends ordered fish bowls and I ordered a milkshake that he had then make inside.  We will  be returning on our next visit for more drinks and to try their food because it's looks delicious."}
{"text":"It is very similar Cheese Cake Factory. Don't let the name to confuse you. They have a menu very similar to Cheese Cake Factory. We ordered a Mediterranean chicken pasta with dried tomato. Also we requested hot tea. Waiters told us they are out of hot tea. But latter she was able manege to find some for us. It is really nice of her."}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night. Not too crowded. We were seated immediately. The menu is huge and it's so hard to decide what to order, but we settled on the lollipop goblet, rainbow sliders, mac and cheese pops, and white chocolate burger. They were out of the mac and cheese pops. :(  They started us with the goblet. It's pretty messy. When the waitress dumped the liquid into the goblet it boiled violently and got all over our table. We had to use our napkins to soak up the mess, she didn't even seem to noticed. Be careful when drinking these goblets because the dry ice creates gas and that gas is pretty painful when you inhale it if your straw is unfortunate will enough to hit an air pocket.  You will end up with a mouth full of gas up your nose and it's pretty painful. The sliders were pretty good that was probably one of my favorite parts of the meal. The burger was OK but super messy and not at all visually appealing. The fries it came with were pretty good. We decided to try a milkshake for dessert and had the Smore's milkshake. Be forewarned this thing contains a lot of espresso! I stayed up all night easily after drinking that milkshake, but it was so good. Layers of chocolate and marshmallow. The marshmallows were toasted to perfection! Service was a bit slow for how empty they were on a Monday night, but it's a place you want to hang out at for a while anyways. I will definitely have to make a return trip to try some more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Amazing food, best place to be at town square.  Great happy hour, awesome staff!  You can't go to town square without a visit to sugar factory!"}
{"text":"I've never eaten the food at Sugar Factory but I have visited for their drinks. They have awesome goblet drinks that are full of candy and are super delicious! We ordered their lollipop passion goblet which is described on the menu as \"a wonderful mix of melon, coconut and pineapple blended together to create a taste sensation no one will be able to resist! Garnished with lollipops\" Our goblet came to the table and it is huge, I am glad the husband and I decided to share this drink. It had two huge rainbow lollipops and a candy necklace inside. The server pours our drink and we were surprised it had some kind of dry ice or something in it to make the drink bubble and smoke. (It was super neat) We had great service, the woman who took care of us was very attentive even though we only came in to order a drink to share. The drinks are expensive though and I wish I knew beforehand that yelp has a special. If you check in on yelp you get 50% off your goblet drink, which would have saved us at least $25, but you live and you learn! Next time I would for sure use the check in offer if it is still available.  Overall the drink was super refreshing and not too sweet. We will return. The decor of the restaurant is super cute, they have awesome looking food and great service."}
{"text":"Our whole experience was terrible! We had a table for 11. When we got seated we were given 2 menus... And after some time had passed had to request for additional menus for the rest of the adults. After ordering our food we waited and received three orders first, as they were finishing up the rest of the orders came out. We also had 5 kids with us and one order of French fires to keep a child occupied was the very last to arrive. Throughout our whole meal we were continually asked, \"who had....\" And it was something that no one had ordered.   Ordered the Manhattan Eggs Benedict, definitely not worth the wait and I'm not a hard person to please when it comes to food!  Maybe because it was auto-grated so they just didn't care however it was defiantly top ten worst experiences."}
{"text":"Exactly one week ago today my family and I along with in-laws drove to Las Vegas to celebrate my sons 9th birthday. As soon as we checked in to our hotel rooms we asked my son where he wanted to have dinner for his birthday and he said Sugar Factory.  He was so excited and us adults were excited too (we had seen pictures on Instagram, tv shows etc).  Right away I called to make a reservation for a party of nine (4 adults and 5 kids ranging from 3-9years old) at around 7:45pm.  We all got ready to head out and walked the strip a bit.  While walking and passing the restaurant we saw that it was empty and the kiddos were already hungry so I stopped and spoke with the hostess and she was able to sit us right away. We all were relieved and happy because the kids were hungry and super excited to dine there.  We were taken upstair to the \"Chocolate Room\" then our waiter came.  I forgot to get his name, I should have written it down but my oh my was this waiter so rude! I don't know if he was annoyed because it was so many of us or that we had 5 kids with us but cmon its a damn restaurant what do you expect! Any-who,  my daughter and I went to the restroom and on the way out we saw our waiter. I told him hey it's my sons birthday and right away he answered me as if he was annoyed stating they DO NOT do free birthday cheers I would have to buy a dessert and also pay a $5 fee to have the waiters come out and wish him a happy birthday.  Fine I was okay with it, I could've paid extra, not a big deal but the way he responded to me was unprofessional.  Because of his sassy attitude I decided not to bother with ordering my sons desert.  Mind you guys... it took forever for us to get our drinks...and it took forever for him to order our food! He would leave and come back minute after, lets just put it this way we literally had like a photosesh outside with all the kids because he was just taking so long.  Point blank this waiter ruined our mood, and to top it off I paid over $80 for our meal and unacceptable service. What urked me even more was the fact that his tip was already included on our bill.  I would not have left a tip at all if I had the option.  My son and I along with our in laws were looking forward to the desert and having a good birthday dinner and he ruined it. We all felt uncomfterable it was only obvious this waiter was annoyed or idk having a bad day. I was so upset and irritated by the waiter that I even wrote on the receipt stating If it wasn't for the added gratuity on the check I would have left nothing as a tip! $0! I also wrote a piece of advice to give better service next time. I hope his manager read it or who knows he probably threw it away so he wouldn't get in trouble.  Just a shame the food was really good but the service was just horrible and that alone threw off our dinner and even our mood for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Sugar Factory is definitely a novelty.  Their elaborate drinks, desserts, and meals are instagram-worthy and will make your followers swoon.  I was tempted by the enormous goblet drinks, but opted for a water to save my appetite (and bank account) for the delicious milkshakes for dessert.  For my meal, I ordered the Farmer burger, which part of their monster burger collection.  It was a unique burger with gravy on top, which was amazingly good.  The burger was huge, so it is worth the price you pay for it.  For dessert, I ordered one of their insane milkshakes and decided on the Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake shake.  These are pretty expensive-- but again, you get what you pay for.  The glasses are coated with various chocolate coatings, which are pretty, but not really functional as anything more than decoration.  My milkshake had a giant lollipop, a piece of cheesecake, and a piece of sugar daddy candy on top-- so it really felt like 4 desserts in one.  One of the shakes even has a bacon cheeseburger on it!  The shake was delicious, but I couldn't finish the entire thing.  If your shake has candy on it, they will package up your candy for you to go if you can't finish it, which is nice.  In summary, this is a place you go for the novelty.  The food is great, don't get me wrong, but the draw is really the elaborate foods.   Be prepared to shell out a lot of money, but it is an experience and is 100% worth it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fell in love with this place and their service. When my friends and I came they have only been opened for 2 weeks. The building is beautiful. The drinks are great- very sweet. Our waitress, Kari was the BEST. Her personality, service and demeanor is amazing! A must go in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Over priced for mediocre food. Asked for the lollipop goblet, said they didn't have it so I ordered a different one. About 10 minutes later I saw someone drinking the lollipop goblet. When I went to leave I saw another person drinking a lollipop goblet!!! Paid $15 extra dollars to keep the plastic glass, I asked if they could dump the ice or give me a clean one and they said that would cost $25! Dessert was good.... that's probably all I would recommend."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience with a waitress/server by the name of Mijka on my birthday! She made rude facial remarks toward me after charging me incorrectly. She thought my friends didn't pay their tab & in actuality they did pay their tab! Although she charged us 2x for the same tab! I had a party of 10 & she was very disoriented the entire time she waited on our table. Almost like a deer in the headlights! She needs to work on getting the customers engaged in what the Sugar Factory has to offer by displaying a more positive/upbeat energy with the customers! She's lifeless. Luckily Gerard, the manager is the BEST in life! He literally made everything better & made me want to go back. I rate his service a 10! Mijka on the other hand need's a lot of guidance & coaching from upper management in order to be successful. If the proper coaching isn't given, I'm sure Mijka will continue to be rude, provide poor customer service & cause a deficit in revenue for Sugar Factory. The atmosphere is fun & is great for selfies. The food & Goblet drinks are the best!"}
{"text":"I was in Vegas visiting my family for Thanksgiving weekend and we decided to visit this place for some goodies. I was extremely disappointed though...   I usually go on Yelp to give good reviews, but I need to post this so that maybe the manager can take action. As we arrived, we were greeted by the server & got a table pretty fast, must have been because it was kind of empty. Then after that, it just kept getting worse!   It was our first time here, so we asked the waiter what he recommended to which he didn't know what to reply & on top of that didn't offer the daily specials. We finally ordered & got the wrong item, we ordered BBQ wings and instead got hot wings. We told the waiter and he said he would correct the error, but he never came back instead ignored the issue. We also ordered the lollipop goblet and he didn't bother to make the experience cool. He also didn't come check on us to see if everything was okay. Especially after knowing our order was incorrect. We still tipped the 18% although the waiter was horrible and didn't deserve it.   This location needs to work on their customer service or change their staff. I should not have gone after their 3 star review, but I decided to give it a chance. But it definitely lived up to it. I hope the one on the strip is not as bad as this one.   I gave this place 2 stars only because the interior was pretty nice."}
{"text":"We came with a large group of ladies for dinner. Service was awful. Took about a half hour to get a drink."}
{"text":"Today was our last day in Vegas so we decided to try out this place. The atmosphere is cool and clean. We only had dessert but it was good."}
{"text":"Amazing! The drinks are super fun and delicious. The macNCheese Burger is to die for. The milkshakes are the best I've ever had. Thanks Sugar Factory for a super fun afternoon!!! I'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I really can't with this place.   Want to start with the positive - which is that our waiter was super attentive to our large group and definitely tried his best.   The food is beyond mediocre, and unfortunately its not only that, but they also served me raw chicken. I ordered the chicken tenders. I noticed that two of them were stuck together and there was a white sauce coming out of it. Thinking it was just ranch, I pulled them apart only to find out that the chicken was literally raw and uncooked. I wanted to vomit. I immediately alerted my waiter who was super apologetic. They re-brought it out, but at this point I could only take a couple bites cause of fear. After like 2 bites, I look down to discover a long black hair, which is the opposite of my hair color. I couldn't anymore.   IDK if they're just like rushing to get the food out because our baked brie was cold in the middle and we sent it back to make it gooey.   Super health hazard and if I hadn't realized before eating the chicken that it was literally raw, things could've been a lot worse for them"}
{"text":"I took my wife to the Sugar Factory today for the very first time for both of us.  Not what i expected at all. Here are my reasons:  1.) 8 min on the phone on hold. Actually drove to restaurant and was still on hold when I was sat. The phone rang as we were walking by and the hostess seemed oblivious.  2.) Spoke with Lana the manager and informed her of the phone situation and she  couldn't seem more uninterested.   3.) Decor is bland and doesn't pop as you would expect the sugar factory brand to do in a Vegas setting.  4.)  Manager kept glancing over at our table as she spoke with other employees.  5.) Server never brought straws for our drinks the first time around and brought 1 for my wife with her second drink, but none for me.  6.) Food Runner claimed that the dressing on the house salad was made in house but clearly tastes like wishbone. The employee that brought it was so caught off guard he couldn't even get his scripted line out right  7.) Used a groupon and total bill came to $42 and with discount was $21.40. Gave the server $30 and never saw her again. $9.00 tip for bad service. Even if I tipped 15% on the total, it would only be $6.30.   This is the last time i will ever visit this establishment. The food was decent, but the service was far below par for Las Vegas, and it was only 2:30 in the afternoon with more workers than guests.  When we left, the same hostess was outside the location flirting with a guy and the phone was just ringing.   Being that i work in a place the is a tourist attraction and local hot spot, when asked for recommendations,  this will definitely not be one of them."}
{"text":"Okay spot for sweet treats right on the strip. We came in on a Sunday afternoon and we must have picked a really bad time because I guess they were having a shift change and we didn't get to order for almost 25 minutes after looking through our menu. Our server walked past our table multiple times and didn't even make eye contact, and then when he finally came back he brought a female server with him and told us they're having a shift change and she will be our server now. It didn't make sense because even after we finally ordered our food and drinks and started on them after everything arrived, we saw him walking around within the restaurant and serving other tables and still working??  Anyways.. the food is mediocre. I'd only come back for the drinks. Things are overpriced for the quality but it is Vegas and it is a spot right on the strip so its expected. Their chocolate shake, I forgot the exact name, was really good. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich and Turkey Club we ordered was prepared fresh and a good sized serving, but we didn't find it to be anything spectacular. It was good but not as good as what some others hyped it up to be. Like I said, only come here for drinks and you'll have a good time. They have a lot of cool, interesting drinks with lots of candy and chocolate options and you can even make your own."}
{"text":"Service was slower than slow. We had a party of 8, but with a reservation our food took ridiculously long. The drinks are yummy and novelty fun, instagram worthy if you will. We didn't even get to dessert because of how long our food took. Food was nothing special. Save your time, skip the table and just hit the bar for a fun drink!"}
{"text":"Brandon was a GREAT server. Awesome customer service. The food was amazing, drinks were amazing, although we didn't have room for dessert other tables ordered and it looked fantastic!! Definitely coming back just to try it and requesting to sit in Brandon's section."}
{"text":"The watermelon goblet is amazing! Cool presentation and so yummy too! It's pretty sweet so if you like sweet drinks, this is for you! Food was good too. We ordered the club sandwich and Sugar Factory Burger. Our waiter, Manny, was also great! He was very attentive and even waited for us as we put our phones on record when he mixed the drink into the goblet :) This place is a must do when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"All time FAVORITE spot! Their goblets are so amazing. Now that they moved locations we don't go too often but when we do, we always go all out. Part of their new menu item they added was the rainbow sliders... delicious! We went with a group of 6 recently to celebrate 2 birthdays and had an amazing time. There's a dj that plays live music and the environment is so fun! Our server Manny was so generous and kind, he had a great energy and enthusiasm. The menu has soooo many choices. Must try items... white chocolate burger, the Mac and cheese burger, chicken Alfredo pasta, ALL the goblets!! The drake is one of my favorites. The desserts are something else. The presentation of the food is so cute and well thought out. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Not only was the service GREAT but the desserts was AMAZING!!! Thank you Erick with a CK lol you are GREAT"}
{"text":"Service is excellent here and they do make that a priority. Chinese chicken salad lacks flavor with the dressing and quite bland. I would get a different next time. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Went here with my fiancé for a date night and it was great! We tried the white gummy goblet and that was super good enough to share. Our server Erick was amazing! Definitely entertained us and made sure we were having a good time. It was a Thursday and it so happen to be ladies night at the chocolate lounge upstairs, they had drink specials and a giveaway which was pretty cool. The music was good and the decor was very cute especially outside on the patio area! Would def recommend coming here for date night or girls night for sure!"}
{"text":"BEAWARE!!! I been to the Sugar Factory at Paris that closed down and all I have to say at Fashion Show Mall was one of the worst restaurants I been to in my life. This place has changed a whole lot and I am for sure they will go out of business. Everything there from the food to the candy side are soooo expensive, so you would think the food and candy would be amazing? Absolutely NOT! Even the people working for the restaurant have the worse customer service ever! The prices are over the top and there burgers are Blah to there cold fries. I couldn't believe on Fathers Day we have a table of 9 and ask can we sit where there was a table with no one sitting there the lady said no it's for another guest. Literally while sitting with 7 little tables that moved everywhere for roughly 2 and half hours no one came for the reservations SMH ?. So I'm thinking are they racist and think ? Finally we are done eating and paying for a check that was astronomical, then to find out a-white family was seated where we originally said can we move to that side of the table. Lol! I would never in my life go to a place that sells a GOBLET for 40.00 and it's the worse drink with absolutely no alcohol. Anyone reading this I promise you do not waste your time. Go to Cheesecake or Maggiano's by far."}
{"text":"This place is aesthetically attractive with a menu with lots of options . Major potential to be my fave place , however , service killed it for me . The hostess rolled her eyes when I asked for a different seat ( something where I can sit next to my love , not a one top where I have to sit across from him ) , our server was annoyed and rushed and observed him being seated very close with larger parties . He forgot drinks as my love struggled to finish dinner .  As we checked out with the server we had to chance to rate him , right in front of him , I passed on the option and he kindly gave himself 5 stars with no explanation of the meaning of the review . Spoke to the manager concerning service and lacked interest with awkward silences even though I expressed my understanding of the server being overwhelmed .  Not sure the atmosphere or the food is worth 100 bucks for 2 when there's poor service ."}
{"text":"Amazing so much fun !!! The food has gotten so much better than it was a few years ago. We've been to this new strip location a few times and it gets better every time. The burgers and fries are always good , and you have to try one of the huge milk shakes !!!! This is a fun place to take your family for the night you can park at the mall and easily walk over. Don't forgot to check out the candy shop before you leave"}
{"text":"I know that this place is super gimmicky but holy moly, I had an excellent time considering I walked in with pretty low expectations.  First off, our server Marc did an excellent job in making us feel welcome. He explained everything and recommended some of the stronger goblets (maybe my party looked like we could drink?) He was also very professional and took really great care of us the whole time we were there, even though we did not order a whole lot of things.  My lollipop passion goblet was delicious! Yes, it was super sugary but it also packed quite a punch, I shared mine with the boyfriend and still ended up a bit tipsy. The lollipops and the candy bracelet was such a fun touch, Marc even offered me a bag to take my lollipops to go.  I tried my friend's calamari and it tasted so much better than I expected it to be, crispy and the marinara sauce that came with it was delicious, we felt that we had waited too long to receive it considering the place wasnt busy at all while we were there.  A few reasons that makes this place not 5 stars: -The price: I got one goblet drink and an appetizer, $75 ish including a nice tip. That's a little ridiculous in my personal opinion but hey it's the strip and I guess if you got cash to burn, you do you.  -The candy store was all out of their couture pops/refills: besides trying this place out, I was looking forward to purchase some refills and maybe some new handles. I did not see a single one in the storw. It doesn't make sense to me that they could be completely out of what they are known for."}
{"text":"Came in last night for my gfs 21st birthday. We had dinner at yard house and the plan was to have drinks and dessert here after.... We should have just stayed at YH.   My Gf had a reservation all set up, they even called to confirm with her a few days ago. When we all arrived they took us to a table and we heard one of the hostesses telling the server \"they didn't even have a reservation\" it's not like we needed one, there were maybe two tables in there that were occupied, and for good reason...  I've dinned at the sugar factory on the strip before so I was very surprised at the horrible service we received at this location. The server never told us their name and the GM refused us his card. Our table was being completely ignored. I've been in the restraunt Industry for 13 years now and how we were being treated was completely uncalled for. I told the server a few times to bring out my gfs birthday dessert because another table got there's but nothing. It never happened. It really put a damper on the night.  There are so many places in Vegas especially to celebrate your 21st and we chose here... But we will never make that mistake again. I would be much happier paying full price for the other location or somewhere else entirely."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server was super sweet. I had the chicken fingers which were good and my boyfriend had the club which I tried and was equally as delicious. The drinks are the greatest part. I had the Grape Crush drink and it literally tasted like Grape Crush but it came with a nice little buzz ;) We shared a dish bowl with gummy bears and the RedBull in it and it was SO good. Total was $100 for 2 drinks, 2 lunches, and 1 fishbowl which was a little steep but when in Vegas... Will return!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I decided to try out the sugar factory today but it was a short visit. Once we were seated, no one had even acknowledged us for 15 minutes. A lady finally came around and asked us for our drink orders. Almost another 10 minutes and we still didn't receive our waters. We got up and left but 3 people managed to say thank you and come again on our way out. There were at least 10-15 people working and it wasn't even busy. Looks like I'll be going back to the one on the strip from now on."}
{"text":"Extremely upbeat place! You walk in and it is LOUD!!!   -The décor is super cute and fun.  -Cute bathroom with the fancy air pockets.  -Visit the candy store while you wait for your food. They have such a great variety of food to bring back to your little ones, or friends as souvenirs. I made the mistake of saying, \"I'll visit the other Sugar Factory to pick up something, and never came back. :( -I ordered the garbage salad and it was pretty damn good. The portions are pretty large. I can't remember the name of the drink I ordered. But, it was green, with a candy rim and it was heaven. It tasted like a melted popsicle. (That's a good thing!)  This will be a fun experience. Is there better food elsewhere, sure. But its a fun place. The waiter was extremely nice. However, we mentioned in our reservation it was my daughters birthday, and to the waiter, but she didn't get a special treat. :( I thought asking a third time would be excessive...."}
{"text":"Disappointing.   For drinks I ordered the cherry tootsie pop cocktail. When my drink came, it looked nothing like the one on the menu. My drink didn't look appetizing at all. And I swear there's suppose to be a gummy worm that comes with my drink. The drink tasted exactly like a cherry tootsie pop so it definitely lived up to it's name. However it was just too sweet for me.   I ordered something simple for food. The Signature Sugar Factory Burger. It tasted like a plain burger to me. So i was confused with what made it their signature burger. Again, it didn't look like what it looked like in the menu. This burger comes with crispy fried onion. The burger I got had a pinch of fried onion that only took up less than half the burger. And it wasn't crispy at all. It was soggy. In fact, when i bit into it, you could't tell if there was any onions in it at all. I asked for cheddar cheese and they gave me swiss. The bun was great, the patty was perfect. I didn't taste any mayo. And I had one piece of lettuce.  My mom ordered the Sugar Factory club sandwich. That sandwich tasted like something you buy at a gas station. The menu says that it comes with turkey breast. The turkey that was in our sandwich tasted like ham. And it looked like ham too. It also looked like it was store bought straight from the sandwich meat department, in the containers. I expected there to be a piece of avocado in the sandwich but there was only a thin layer of avocado spread that you can barely see.   Oh and the water didn't taste right.  Other than that, the service was good. The french fries were good as well. But i don't think i'll ever go there again. Maybe to try their goblet drinks."}
{"text":"Great service yummy food !!! Love the goblet this place is amazing! Can't wait to come back again their steak is so yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the sugar factory on the strip and loved it so when I saw this yelp deal I thought I would check this one out too. The food was great as always. I got a banana split crepe but the service was lacking. It took us at least 10 minutes to just get a drink. The waitress looked like she would rather not be there. Took a while to get anything even though there were 20 waiters walking around to the 3 tables filled. Good food, meh customer service."}
{"text":"This was seriously the absolute WORST service I have EVER experience. I was with a group of 5 girls. 3 were seated and given Complimentary drinks for Ladies Night & told the waitress (Terri D.) that they were waiting for 2 more ladies to order. The last two arrived and we had to wait 30 minutes before we were even acknowledged again! We tried to wave her down, she put a finger up signaling she'd be there in a second. We literally went up to another waitress and just asked her to please take out order, she said you guys aren't in my section so I'll just tell her... WELL SHE DIDNT. We waved down what looked to be a manager and told him how we had not be attended in over 45 minutes, she finally came around apologizing that she was busy & had too many tables. It literally felt like she was just plain ignoring us because in the time we spent waiting to get our food and drinks; 3 appetizers & 2 goblets (2 1/2 hours +) we saw the two tables next to us get several rounds of drinks and one of them managed to finish a goblet, have dinner, order dessert, & was even sung happy birthday to. So obviously she was just \"TOO BUSY\" to stop by our table for some reason. Oh by the way we were half way into our goblets before we had to stop the manager again to ask him to get us the complimentary drinks for the two other ladies who arrived a little late. And the only reason we bothered him again is because we waited over 20 minutes after asking Terri again to bring them...   I don't buy her too busy excuse because I saw plenty of other tables being attended and serviced... it felt personal, we felt ignored and for no reason. We were trying to be polite but we are never doing ladies night here ever again."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food and the best server! We love Shane!! Coming back next week for happy hour & hoping to have him as a server again! :)"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner on a Saturday night. We were immediately greeted at the door and seated. Our waitress was prompt and came to check on an appropriate amount of times. The music is fairly loud and energetic! The tables are close together, not so much room for intimate eating. We ordered the calamari, it came out over cooked and salty, the outside crust was terribly crunchy and the calamari itself was hard. We then ordered a turkey burger, which was good, not worth $17. It was average is size and came with a small helping of shoe string fries. For dessert we had the bananas foster. We were so excited when it arrived. It looked so delicious! Our excitement left us the moment we tried to cut the macadamia nut cookies, but couldn't. They were so hard.... just disappointed. Would not dine here again. Glad we used Groupon and saved some cash!!!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great ambiance, great service, great food!  I has a savory crepe and it's portion was hefty. Delicious choice and there is enough to take leftovers home if needed.  The grape crush was okay.   You can RSVP via OpenTable."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have some of the best exotic drinks in the city! The music was great service was awesome. Jus a overall great environment. Will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"Had the Chinese chicken salad, which was ok.  Also had the ice cream Sunday which was excellent!! Our server Anthony was pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"Went here and was so excited to try this place out! The management is awful! I was Walking back from the bathroom and ended up slipping on something that looked like grease or floor cleaner. The hostess saw me and asked if I was ok and that was it. She told me she'd have someone clean it But apparently never did because minutes later, and older lady slipped in the exact same spot as me on the exact same grease.  Again, the same hostess came up to her too. You would think a manager or someone \"superior\" would come up to the table asking if everything was ok.... But no. They acted like nothing happened. Fuck this place. Save your money. Terrible staff and crappy food."}
{"text":"Horrible service, hot chocolate was delivered 10 minutes after the rest of our order, and tasted terrible. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Bring your kids and your sweet tooth !  Great selection except for the make your own sugar stick area.  Most of the powders were out, but my niece made the best out of it  with the little selection she had."}
{"text":"So the boyfriend took me to the Sugar Factory at Town Square for a sweet dinner last night. When I called ahead  I asked the hostess if there was a wait for a table and she said no. Once we got there, 5 minutes later, the hostess told us there were no tables available just the bar, ugh. So another hostess (tall, thin, blonde hair) told us she would open up a section and seat us, perfect! We waited for 5 minutes for our water, which the nice hostess brought us surprisingly) and another 10 for the waitress to take our order. There was a DJ setting up and two men in blazers following each other around, strange but funny! The music was ridiculously loud so our visit was starting to turn sour at this point. My boyfriend ordered a beer and 5 minutes later was told was out of that beer. He ordered another beer and after about 10 minutes no beer and the food came. One of the men in the blazers came by to ask us if the music was too loud and my boyfriend asked about his beer. He came back to tell us he was out of that beer too, really?! He noticed the disappointment and brought a Makers and coke on him, nice! After we started eating we noticed the man in the blazer come back in with a plastic bag and then served the beer we had ordered, wow. The Manager went out to get the beer that we ordered, AMAZING!! My boyfriend ordered a burger and the fries were super good. I ordered the ham and cheese crepe and aside from the cheese being overpowering, it was yummy and the nutter flutter shake was killer! There was also a server that was dancing as he was serving his orders and I mean sliding across the floor on his knees, lol! Pros and cons aside I was impressed with the management pulling it together for the staff and making sure tables were happy :) btw I just ate the red velvet cake I took to go and I will say this like a high school girl, OH EM GEE MMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"This location is so much better than the one on Las Vegas blvd. 100% the best experience tonight. Jeff is an awesome server and we'll be coming back just to see him! Highly recommend coming, they have a great happy hour with 50% off of cocktails!! Doesn't get much bette than that. Thank you for a great ladies night!"}
{"text":"I didn't have such a great experience at the Sugar Factory inside the Paris, so when I found out this is where we would be meeting up for a birthday dinner, I was a bit bummed. I hadn't been to this newer location at Town Square though and only had dessert and drinks at the Paris location, so trying actual food from Sugar Factory I had a open mind for. Walking in they have candy and lollipops for sale, but they have price tags on them that are way overpriced. I couldn't ever see spending what they are charging for a sucker that spins.   Our server, Manolo was great. He checked on us often and seemed genuine, not pushy trying to get us to order apps, drinks, merchandise, etc. He just was the type of server you wish you always had when eating out. The place was packed inside and even the tables outside the restaurant were filled, but the servers did a great job at taking care of everybody.   I ordered a \"S'mores Martini\" priced at $14 and was a bit disappointed. Sure it looked cute and tasted alright, but it tasted more like candy than anything I would catch a buzz off. My hubby's Reese's drink was much more tasty. Priced also at $14 I had a \"Garbage Bowl Salad\" for dinner and substituted the vinaigrette that comes on it for ranch dressing. The salad had lettuce, pepperoni, salami, cucumbers, tomato, avocado, mozzarella and provolone. The menu said it also came with croutons, but what a bummer they weren't on the salad! There was enough other stuff so it worked out. The salad was really good. I liked the crisp, fresh lettuce and the amount of ripe delicious avocados they put in it. The bottom was filled with salami and pepperoni as well. I kept eating and eating and still there was salad left!   The key with Sugar Factory is to come here when it's HH or with some type of deal/coupon. The drinks and much of the menu is just way too overpriced and coming here and paying full price will more than likely leave not only a dent in your wallet, but will probably leave you feeling like not ever coming back. Currently there is a yelp check-in offer for $15 that gets you $25 (not valid Fridays & Saturdays) and they have a groupon right now for this location where you can pick from a few different deals depending on the size of your party. Sugar Factory also has different deals depending on the day. The HH runs Mon - Fri from 3 pm - 6 pm where you can get BOGO cocktails and half off appetizers, pizzas and burgers. If you are coming here to drink anyway then coming here when it's better priced makes more sense.  P.S. The cel reception in here is no good! I had no signal most of my visit and when I did it was just 1 bar. Everyone at my table had this same issue.  P.S.S. The music is TOO LOUD! It's hard to have a conversation with people sitting next to you because the music is annoyingly loud."}
{"text":"I came to the Sugar Factory on a Monday afternoon with my boyfriend. We were offered a 2 for 1 \"goblet\" drink offer which was pretty inviting.  After receiving our menus we were given enough time to watch an episode of Joel Osteen before our server came back to ask for our orders.   We didn't receive any silverware or napkins once our Mac and cheese balls appetizer arrived, so we used our hands and licked our fingers to stay sanitary and ensure we could use our hands for hunting better food at a later time.    We ordered the charcuterie platter and when the food runner brought it out he spilt all the pickles on my leg, and the container fell to the floor. My boyfriend and I were like, \"it's cool...things happen.\" As he went to go scavenge for more pickles I noticed we did not receive bread with our meat platter. When we asked for the bread, the food runner looked confused and out of place. .... (how can you eat paté by itself or meats and mustard w/o any bread.  It's like ordering a pizza with no dough.). We were polite upon asking for our bread as it clearly states it is included on the menu.  I usually wouldn't write a 1 star review of this caliber as I see them being a decent warning, yet a waste of time. However, I wouldn't want anybody wasting their time at this establishment."}
{"text":"Try the candy bar shakes, they are amazing!  I had the Twix shake, and it was a taste of heaven."}
{"text":"Great food menu.very unique drinks, most which are really pricey. Which is why it looses a star.overall a great place with excellent food and drinks.and the sidewalk elevated seating was grand."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time the place was great but sad thing is when checking on the menu no body explain about the drinks and it doesn't show the price only the huge picture of it. My daughter was upset because she ordered her non alcoholic cotton candy drink but unfortunately it doesn't have dry ice! The server said dry ice is to follow after one hour we already finish our drink sadly they still dont have.So that is the highlight shes looking for.  We paid 30$ each drinks without incomplete presentation of it! Not a happy customer."}
{"text":"Overcrowded and the service is subpar! Friend ordered Med Rare burger, it came out Well Done the 1st time and Med Well the 2nd. My niece & I ordered Steak and Eggs... she got mine Med Well and I got hers Med Well  Not impressed. Manager didn't even come over to the table to apologize for the mishap."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this, I was expecting A LOT more than what we got. It's very fancy but we waited almost 25+ to get water, then our waitress was VERY rude cutting off the little girls at the table and being snappy. By the way his name was Ricardo. He rushed us and then expecting a $20 tip even though he only interacted with us twice and both were rude interactions! The food was good but I wouldn't go there again unless I was guaranteed GOOD service!  It was my boyfriends moms birthday and I'm sure that ruined it for her. Thanks Sugar Factory!"}
{"text":"Drinks were cute but way overpriced!!  I guess my first clue was there was no prices on the menu but I would have never thought they would have been $40.00 for one drink and you don't get the glass unless you want to pay more for it.  My husband had a salad and I had the mini sliders with one drink and it cost $130.00!!!!! Then they want you to tip on the $40 drink, I don't think so. We only saw a waiter twice.  Won't be visiting here again."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for their Sunday brunch. I was here yesterday on a private event and had lots of fun. It was on the 2nd floor at the Chocolate lounge.  The Sugar Factory is indeed a cute and a popular hot spot in Vegas. They have an indoor and outdoor seating. Their signature menu offers everything from pancakes and sweet and savory crepes to burgers, salads, and pizzas.  We all had drinks on their famous goblets with dry ice that makes them fizz and bubble. The drinks and sweets were tasty, however, the food was a little bland.  The lower level is the Sugar factory dining experience as well as a confectionery offering gifts and sweets for every taste.   The music was loud and so we sat outside on the patio. I'd definitely recommend the Sugar Factory if you want awesome ice cream with lots of choices."}
{"text":"I Love The Sugar Factory. The Food, Drinks and Dessert were excellent. My kids really enjoyed the signature drinks. This place is perfect for a date night or a lunch or dinner with your family. We went on a Thursday and there was no wait. I can't wait for the next time I'm in town to go back there."}
{"text":"This menu needs a major overhaul. Everything on the menu is junk. Absolute garbage. It was so hard to decide what to order because nothing looked good. I ended up ordering the Signature Burger with onion rings. The burger was bearable but cost $17, and they gave me fries instead of onion rings. I'm consistently shocked with how Restaurants on the Strip get away with charging so much for such poor quality food and service."}
{"text":"Drew youre the man! He was an absolute peach and took care of my motley crew of eight! Now some people can't even handle my rowdy husband and I but this guy Drew did it x's four! All of the food was great and everything came out in perfect time. Everyone was happy and the party was in full swing! My husband and I were ever the heroes With the crew, everyone had a blast.    My only tiny tiny gripes were that the AC didn't work at full capacity because we were all a little warm, and the chicken and waffles wasn't quite as good as I had on the strip a year ago, but these things aren't enough from keeping me to come back and see Drew!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I admit wasn't the best maybe our waiter was having a bad day or whatever. But the second time we went back I felt better than ever. My glass was never empty, the waiter always checked to see how we were doing, and even though this place was packed we still got our food fast. This is place is good for their desserts and burgers"}
{"text":"Dinner and desserts were actually really good and our service outstanding! We are always looking for a kid friendly fun restaurant and we thought we found it until a bald loud mouth man came yelling as we were taking a picture  of my daughter and her cousin in the front the restaurant next to the yellow duck. He completely embarrassed the sweet hostess in the front as we let him know she gave us the ok to take the picture. Not knowing who was this loud mouth man yelling from a distance as We later found out it was the owners brother! The approach should have been totally different, perhaps some training when working with the public not just because you are the owners brother does it give anybody the right to speak to anyone the way he spoke to myself and my family. We will never be returning to this place! My 9 year old daughter and her cousin were shocked!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disappointed. My first time with sugar factory was at the one located inside Paris Casino and it was okay. They were always known for their goblets and food was not something great the rave about.   This would be my second time and I went to the town square Sugar Factory. It was the worst service I've ever had! We had a party of 6 girls and we had the groupon deal. I know it says one per a table so we thought if we couldn't combine then we'll sit at the bar. So when our server came we asked her about it and she said her manager will honor the groupon but we wouldn't be able to order out of happy hour. Happy hour? We never knew about happy hour! To make it short, the groupon was misleading saying that it's good for 2 drinks and 2 dinner when it's really you have to spend $30 worth of alcohol before you can get to entrees of dinner! So you would end up paying $60 for this so called deal! Not happy!  So in the end it was just cheaper to just order out if happy hour, which was half off of all alcohol drinks.   At the end of our meal, the server who already started giving us attitude since we got there asked me if I would like desperate checks or all in one. I told her if it's not too much trouble, we would like separated checks. She said it's not a problem and came back with each one of our checks slapped with 18%! Thanks for telling us! And to top it off they had to charge the 18% off of the full priced goblet which is originally $30. Needless to say.... I will not be coming back here EVER! Food wasn't great, drinks were okay, and customer service was horrible!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had drinks and dinner here this evening. The service was excellent. Our waitress was very attentive throughout the evening.  The food was better than I remembered at the old Paris location.  My burger (I had their signature burger) was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful.  My wife had the crepe and it was perfect.   All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"I have to admit I don't write as many of these as I should. We stopped but the store wasn't open yet. Anxiously waiting and eager to try the Strawberry french toast and Apple waffles. The coffee was excellent and food off the hook! The prices were as expected for Las Vegas. The thing that made this first time experience was our server Justin! Justin's attention to detail was beyond my expectation. We eat out A LOT and there are VERY FEW servers that exceed my expectations. Justin may be only one of a handful of people I've sought out the manager to tell them about how wonderful they were. \"Examples: Justin brought us new silverware because he didn't like that they ones we had weren't polished. He brought me extra strawberries when I questioned if I got the mixed berry or strawberry french toast. (They only have a strawberry version that has a mix of raspberries, black berries and strawberries.)\" I can't give enough stars to how much this experience has raised the bar even more for the rest of the serves I encounter!"}
{"text":"The drinks here are the show stoppers.  Yes, they are sugary and all have a cream or chocolate based liquor.  I thought 60 oz of liquid was too much, but opted for one of their cocktails.  The American Dream consisted of a little chocolate, cream and honey with cinnamon on top.  Everyone kept saying it was horchata, lol.  I liked it considering the food was just ok.  The turkey and brie sandwich was forgettable.  The bread was too hard and there was too much of their herb dressing.  Their eggs benedict wasn't impressive either.  But they did have a fantastic mixed salad.  Not so good when your salad that likely came from a bag was the highlight.  Their menu is here:  http://sugarfactory.com/sites/default/files/SF_AB_Town_Square_Menu.pdf  I will note that we were a party of 4 adults and 3 children one of which was a 6 month baby.  The two kids had ice cream the baby had nothing.  They charged us the auto-gratuity!  I don't eat with kids often, so this was surprising to me."}
{"text":"My buddy keeps raving about this place so I tried it out. It's the BOMB baby!!!! Goblet drinks are big enough to soak in. Food was very good but our waiter made the entire experience. Brandon was a real treat. Informative and a great attitude. That dude was juggling multiple tables. Great drinks, great food, great service......We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"When I first heard Sugar Factory was coming to Town Square I was beyond excited. As a recent transplant to Vegas from NYC I am still not in love with the concept of entering a casino just visit a great restaurant or see a movie.  Ambiance- Love the decor! lots of chandeliers, sparkly, beautiful, and romantic.  Service- A star was lost here. Our server had between two and four tables while we were there and she was LOST. We had to ask for drink refills, the wrong side came with my entree and the bus boy who brought the food smoothly apologized and brought over the correct side. The waitress appeared confused and brushed it off saying he would fix it. She had one other table!! We asked for a dessert menu twice...Our fondue was brought out without the flame underneath and she said \"they are supposed to do that for me.\" 5 minutes later it comes back to our table without an apology. The busboys made up for her lack of service and tact.   We stopped in for an early dinner after a day of shopping and with bags in tow we were shown to a nice sized booth. We ordered the Onion Rings to start they were perfectly crispy. For entrees we had the Steak Bordelaise served with Steak Frites which are like fresh thick cut potato chips and a salad. It was absolutely delicious and a spot on Medium with a beautiful char. The black Angus Filet was ordered medium rare and it too came out perfect. The quality and taste of the meat was apparent. Their mashed potatoes might be the best I have ever had. We also ordered a side of grilled asparagus that paired nicely with our steaks. For dessert we had the hazelnut fondue for two, it was sooo delicious. I enjoyed the white chocolate bread and the strawberries the most.   Although the food was great the service took away from the overall experience. If this was a planned dinner and not a spur of the moment stop in you would be looking at a 3 star review."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to find a Sugar Factory opening up in Town Square, cause let's face it, locals rarely want to make the trip to the strip just to eat. if they're not already avoiding it all together. It was an indeed a smart move to open another location where more locals thrive.   I remember going to Sugar Factory at Paris once and really enjoyed their fries, so I was excited to order them once again. Wasn't too hungry so I just went with the fried mac & cheese pops (appetizer option) as a main course. You get a total of three and I can't complain, but I wouldn't spend $10 on them again either. Fried batter on the outside, mac & cheese on the inside. Simple. I did however enjoy the sauce they provided with it. It was like a tomato cream sauce (with possible melted cheese?).   Ze BF ordered a turkey burger with a side of fries. No, just no, don't do it. Don't even consider it. It was totally dry, bland, and really boring. Sure it has melted cheese (your choice between pepper jack, swiss, and american), sauteed onions, and a small amount of mushrooms, but I feel like those were just added to give it at least some sort of taste. I usually view the extras as something to enhance the taste, not substitute it.   And the one thing they could've gotten correct was the fries. Nope, another miss. Soggy, unsalted, and again boring. If you're dying for fries, just make a quick visit to Yardhouse instead.   Why I don't think this is an absolute fail? The cutesyness of the restaurant. Let's be real, chicks will eat this place up because of the cute decor and fancy cocktails. I'll admit, I am guilty of that too! I could see this being a cute place to grab a quick lunch or weekend brunch with girlfriends, but I definitely don't see me returning here with the BF anytime soon.  As for the service? Well it wasn't terrible but it wasn't attentive either. I do have to say, a gentleman greeted us and was very friendly, but as we were leaving he engaged in a short conversation with us and started throwing N bombs. Erm, instant fired if I was the manager.   Anyway to sum it up, cute place for your girlfriends but don't expect a 5 star meal, or even 4 star, probably a 2.5 star."}
{"text":"it was my birthday 8/2 and our waiter I think his name was mark or matt he was great. He was very welcoming and knowlegable. But look at our bill, it was only 6 of us there and honestly they are way over priced. I can go to a steakhouse out here in Las Vegas and still our bill wont be this high. Not only  that but after the bill was that high they still wanted to charge us for 1 extra piece of candy. Huh, after we just spent $400 dollars in here, your still going to charge us $1.50 for 1 piece of candy. Even though Matt or mark was excellent, the staff after him and that little incident made it all bad."}
{"text":"Here's the Scoop: While shopping on the strip we decided to check this pace out for a quick bite. Lots to choose from on the menu. Whatever your taste might be or if you're undecided you will find something on this menu. The refreshments are outrageous!! Ice crème, smoothies. Oh  my a huge selection. This is the place to go on a hot day in Vegas. Definitely try this place before or after shopping, you wont be disappointedd"}
{"text":"We stopped in here for the first time a few weeks ago and love it.  We've been back a few times a week for drinks and appetizers and everything is excellent.  Must try: Blow Pop, Hubba Bubba or White Chocloate martini.   All great drinks.  We've only sat at the bar but all the staff we have encountered are great.  Maria, Joe and all of the other bartenders are awesome and very friendly.   The manager stopped by our seats and thanked us for visiting again which was a nice touch.  Nice to know their repeat guests are noticed!"}
{"text":"Nice place! I brought my 7 year old daughter and 10 year old niece and they loved it! No issues at all server was great! We ordered the rainbow sliders for my daughter and apparently they only had one orders worth left (which was supposed to be hers) and another waiter took them to someone else but we were offered a FREE substitute meal thank you ANNE MARIE  you'll pay $30 a piece for the big drinks (non alcoholic) but what do ya know I had enuff check ins and was offered 50% off of 1!! Thanks YELP... I have to add this because I love when the workers think of the kids!! There was a very cuuuute little girl next to is who wanted the rubber duck that came with the rainbow sliders and they gave her some free"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this restaurant. My co worker recommended the Sugar Factory Restaurant for my their one of a kind drinks. The night started pretty good our server welcomed us and answered our question about the different drinks. As we waited to get our drinks the fire alarm went off, it went on for 5 minutes then it stopped. It was annoying and loud so we were glad that it stopped. 10 minutes went by and the fire alarm started to go off again. After 30 minutes we received our food. Didn't know what was happening our server just said that there's a problem with the kitchen. At no time did a manager ever come out to the dining room to apologize or even let's us know what was happening. We ate out food as quick as we could so we could get out of the noise. When it was time to pay the system was down they had issues with the computers, don't know if it was due to the fire alarm issue. The couldn't even get me a receipt. I had to check my bank Account to see my final total.    With soo many choices in Vegas don't know If i would return to this restaurant. Bad experience overall."}
{"text":"UPDATE:   After the manager reached out to me on yelp to try again we totally took her up on that offer. Jeneivieve was super apologetic and very prompt in making our reservations after I gave her a date that me and my guest would be available. So one week later me and my best friend went back up to Sugar Factory. And by the end of the night I was FLOORED with how amazing our service was!!  From the moment we got seated we were taken care of. This was the experience that I was looking for last time. We got greeted by the manager  (and he apologized which we graciously accepted) , and then from that moment our waitor Jason gets 5 stars! He was awesome, funny, attentive, and a pleasure all night. There was nothing we asked of him that he did not give us with a smile on his face. We started out the evening with two goblets (he recommended the lollipop one) and on top of presentation the drink was delicious. I will definitely come back for that goblet alone. My friend orderd the Drake and boy oh boy was it strong. You can taste the Virginia Black in it, thankfully the cotton candy added a nice sweetness to balance out all of the alcohol.   He gave us some time to enjoy our drinks and just chaqt before he came over and took our order. (which we appreciated). I ordered the country fried chicken with a side of Herb Varicots (fancy a** green beans) and my friend ordered the steak and frites (which he suggested). Both plates came out piping hot. The chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy texture and a hint of sweetness in the skin. Her steak was cooked thoroughly and by the end of the night BOTH of our plates were empty. Upon the suggestion of the manner we both decided to order deserts. I ordered the red velvet cake. Now to be honest I didn't read it all the way through because I hate raspberry and this cake was loaded with raspberry cream, mousse, layers, syrups.....so that was a miss for me. I got a chance to taste my friends fried ice cream, and to be honest it was just OK. We were so full that the only thing we could really enjoy were the lollipops that were in my drink. (which were amazing).   Let me tell you. This entire night was the exact service we were expecting the first time we came. And although they didn't get it right then, they got it right the second time. They have ultimately changed my heart and I can't wait until my friends can come in town so I can bring them here. Thank you to Jenivieve, Manuel, and Jason for the great night.      Literally the worst experience. From the moment we walked it was just a complete lack of attention, lack of hospitality, lack of well....EVERYTHING.   I made reservations for this place a week and a half prior for 8:30 pm. We were a little early but we definitely wanted to get there early to look around and take some pictures. I heard the upstairs lounge was super cute and we were more than excited to check it out. Once I showed up to the hostess stand there was NO ONE there. After a few minutes of staring idly at the drink bar outside, a manager came out to speak to the bartender (who was watching us stare at him...) and then saw us waiting. He immediately sat us at the empty table outside without asking name questions reservations etc. We thanked him and for 15 minutes we were not acknowledged, offered a glass of water, or even thought about UNTIL we saw another \"manager\" who came out to speak to the table behind us. I got his attention told him our issue, he apologized and said he will be right back to take our order. Then a woman came out who he introduced as the Event Coordinator took our food and drink order (PRAISE THE LORD CAUSE WHO KNEW WHEN WE'D SEE ANYBODY AGAIN).  By the time we got our food an hour has passed, and we never saw the event coordinator or either manager EVER again.   Let's talk about the food. It was SOOO BASIC. I order the jalapeno burger. Jalapenos, roasted tomatoes, Sugar Factory's special sauce and American cheese. Sounds good huh? NAH. They literally through a luke warm patty on a bun popped some uncooked or seasoned jalapenos on it with a slice of cheese, no sauce, no roasted tomato, and some sloppy lettuce. I was so turned off by the service, the food, and the entire night that I sucked it up and just ate it. I was so ready to go. Literally the entire experience ruined my night. At the end of the night I paid 19.00 for a burger that I could have went to Burger King for (at least it would have been hot). I could understand paying for the experience but there was no experience. They had one poor girl working the patio, there were more than enough empty table inside, the ran out of the ingredients for the one goblet we wanted, one glass of water the ENTIRE time. I didn't even bother going upstairs for pictures or to see the rest of the establishment, it was so horrible. I will never go back. EVER."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Food was prepared as requested . Incorrect cheese used as well and then tried to tell us that it was correct cheese .   Over priced and not impressed ."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin....  I messaged sugar factory to ask of they had discounts for locals because my mother was coming for her birthday from California and i wanted to take her someplace fun! I received a message from Jennevive. She let me know about a 20% disc for locals and made my reservation for me on the spot. I asked what she recommended I should order for my mother for her birthday and she stated she would provide \"a little something\" for her on the house she was sure to enjoy. So sweet!! Well...... they did not disappoint!!! When we arrived we were greeted by our waiter Brandon M. Great service from the moment he said hello. The atmosphere was upbeat and beautiful. At least three different people who worked there asked us how everything was and made sure we were happy. I cant remember a time I received such good customer service and with a smile on every single one of them!  My daughter ordered the Dulce De Leche Milkshake. It was exactly how it looks in the menu and absolutely delicious. My mothers martini had her feeling happy and relaxed. The food was top notch. Not joking... the fries...Yummy!! My mom and i ordered salads. I know that was silly at a place like this but they were so good!!   Well when they came out with the \" little something\" for my mother......I couldn't believe my eyes!!!! The lights dimmed and at least ten people followed our waiter singing happy birthday to my mother. I didn't know who to record my mom that was brought to tears or the huge gathering that was singing. Brandon was holding the biggest bowl of ice cream with ice cream cones, whipped cream, so many toppings, candy and fireworks shooting out!! It was HUGE!!!!! The look on my mothers face says it all. I was so happy to see her this excited. She was like a kid on Christmas morning! This was not at all what I was expecting. They went over and beyond!! I truly am grateful to every single one of you at Sugar Factory for making this a memorable birthday experience for my mother. I wish i could go back and hug every single one of you...... Jennevive, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart. That night meant so much to us."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon here for brunch ($59 for two for bottomless mimosas and $24 food voucher for each person) and ended up going into the lounge entrance instead of the main entrance. Needless to say, sitting in the lounge was the best thing we could have done.  Annemarie and Enrique served us and they were the best!!! They made sure we were well taken care of ( even if we were being \"cheap\" in vegas) and made sure we felt like we had the best service!!! I would definitely recommend and make sure you have one, or both, of them as your servers!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted a crepe to go and the cook told me that he can do but it would not be as good because it would be cold.  Well, I get what he is saying, but I wouldn't think of saying that to a customer. I would think the quality of the food would still be good regardless if it was hot or cold.  Blah"}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Sugar Factory! Our server Mannie was super fun and made sure we were taken care of. I got the lollipop goblet and it was beautiful. Loved the presentation. It was very big, but I barely caught a buzz so I think it might be mostly juice. They say there are 7 shots in this drink, but I find this highly unlikely. Everything else was awesome though. The atmosphere is wild and fun. The photo ops abound."}
{"text":"It bothers me to have to say this about the Sugar Factory, the one located inside the Paris Casino is one of my favorite restaurants in town.   The one at Town Square is consistently bad, but they serve breakfast later so I gave them another shot.   An hour wait after being seated with minimal check in by the waitress. The food was nothing like what we ordered and the eggs were overlooked.   The waitress seemed overwhelmed by the four tables she had.   The Meatball Spot that was there prior didn't do well either.  I won't likely be back."}
{"text":"If you want to waste a couple hundred dollars and yell over the music to the person next to you while sipping on a novelty milkshake that has a cheeseburger on the straw, this is the place to go. Otherwise, I would recommend literally anywhere else.  My family and I went here for my mom's birthday lunch a couple days ago and it was awful. We were there at noon on a weekday so it wasn't even busy, but we struggled to get our server's attention the whole time, and none of the other waitstaff walking by would stop to clear plates. We finally had to ask someone and he actually ignored us. It was so weird and not Vegas-like service at all. They also didn't do anything for the \"birthday\" part of the lunch (like saying a simple 'happy birthday') and we didn't bother bringing it up a third time to our waiter. There were five of us and we didn't have alcohol or dessert but it was still over $200 which felt so wasteful. We were all really disappointed by such an icky experience eating out.   More on the food: The blue cheese bacon burger and onion rings  were good.  The fish tacos were really gross.  Chicken fingers, club sando, grilled chicken sando were all fine."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon and brought the kids to try it out. The kids enjoyed the playfulness of the food art. We ordered the Rainbow Sliders, cookie monster milkshake to share, and a basket of fries. I would say, if you love sweets, come here for dessert for sure. We wanted to try more, but didn't have the room."}
{"text":"A great experience. Kids love the environment and the food. They have a wide variety of speciality drinks and a large menu of gourmet food selections to satisfy any pallet. The burger creations are one of a kind which provide even the most experienced foodie a unique experience. If your visiting Vegas and looking for a place to enjoy a one of a kind dining experience Sugar Factory should be at the top of your list."}
{"text":"First, although the restaurant was empty it took so long for us to place an order. We ordered food to share and made sure to inform our server we didn't want everything to come out at the same time if possible, which they said wouldn't be a problem. It took so long and it all came out at once. It also took so long for us to get the check and to pay. Keep in mind there were barley any people inside."}
{"text":"I'd like to start off by saying that the drinks are fantastic, however other than that this place is a miss. I came in with three other friends tonight and I'd have to say their customer service needs work. Hostess outside was nice enough and promptly sat us down after we requested a \"table for 4\". Our server started off friendly when we ordered 2 $40 goblets. When we let him know we weren't interested in ordering food (it was 11 pm) he became visibly upset and said \"I don't know who sat you here, but this is the dining room where you order food. The bar is right over there\". Uhhh okay? I don't work here, I think that's the hostesses job to let us know where to sit and ask us if we're going to be eating or not. Keep in mind the bar has about 6 seats and they were all taken so I don't know what he wanted us to do. There were also plenty of other open tables, the place was no where near full. He proceeded to bring the check right away and slam it down on the table trying to get rid of us and turn the table. I've worked in the service industry before and I understand he wants to make money but considering our bill was $90 for two drinks that all he had to do was drop off at the table, I dont know what he was upset about. That's no way to treat guests, and we won't be returning. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Sugar Factory is such a cute and very popular hot spot, especially in Vegas!  I visited here with my family during our annual Las Vegas trip and it was fun for the experience. To be quite honest, the food was a little bit of a let down. In my opinion this place is overly hyped, which lead me to have high expectations for their food.  They do have really interesting desserts and drinks, but their food tastes mediocre. I wouldn't claim it to be the best I have ever tasted, but it wasn't horrible.  I'd definitely recommend the Sugar Factory if you're looking for a fun night out, and are wanting to try something new! Take lots of pictures because the food (especially their milkshakes) are picture worthy, but don't overestimate the quality of their food."}
{"text":"The kids loved the milkshakes. So much that we went twice. The chocolate martini was delicious and, of course, who doesn't love the smoking goblets. The food was mediocre at best and not worth the money. My friend had an average grilled cheese. I didn't get my omelette because we waited so long for the server it was 4:02 and they stopped serving eggs. That was just one example of the awful service. The first time we went for drinks and dessert service wasn't bad although it took about 20 minutes to get an extra spoon and another 20 for the check. The second time it took 30 minutes to be seated even though there was nobody waiting. Then about 20 minutes for the server to take our order and then about 40 minutes for the order to arrive. We had to ask a different waiter about our food. We made sure to ask for the check when the food came. Of course, they charged for the omelette I wasn't allowed to order. They took it off obviously but it was just another example of the horrible service. This place desperately needs a good manager and a better trained staff especially with the prices they charge!"}
{"text":"I went here on Monday evening with my friend. We wanted to go have drinks and something to eat since our job has been pretty stressful. Wanting to stay close to the strip, we decided on trying out Sugar Factory since neither of us had been since they opened up at this location, but we had been when they were still in the Paris.  We had a reservation for 6pm, but arrived about 15 minutes early. We were greeted right away, and sat promptly. The host was very nice. The decor of the restaurant is so cute and French bistro-like. I love the black, white, and red color scheme.  The menu is pretty large with tons of drink and food options. It took us a little while to decide on what we wanted, and our server was very patient. We ended up getting the mac and cheese pops, 2 Caesar salads, and we split 3 goblet drinks (2 of the lollipop ones and a Gummi one). The goblets were so yummy and cute, just like we remembered. We were here for a little over 3 hours, and the staff was cool about it. My friend said that we would finish our drink and head out soon, but the manager who was by us said no, stay and enjoy as long as you want. That was really nice! The only thing I would improve was the size of the salad. It was kind of small and I am glad we each got our own instead of sharing.  I will definitely come back to this cute place!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfasts, we had great service but what made our experience even better was John the manager.Came and cleared our table, refill our waters and he didn't just do this to our table, I seen him go around the restaurant helping out. That's a great manager right there! He's a team player! Very pleasant and attentive! Thanks John!"}
{"text":"Started out rough, thinking they opened at 1030, but they ended up opening early for us.  All you need to know is they have all you can drink mimosas and bloody marys for $20 on the weekends!  Service was quick and courteous and the food was typical American.  Great spot to relax on the weekends!!"}
{"text":"I never got the chance to visit the original Sugar Factory Brasserie on the Strip back when it was outside Paris LV.  So I was pretty excited when I found out that they re-opened at the Fashion Show Mall.  Now I finally have a chance once again to try some of their outrageous menu items.  I was actually interested in trying one of their Insane Milkshakes on the menu.  In particular, their Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake.  After all, it was National Hamburger Month when I was there.  And it was definitely a huuuuuuuuuuge milkshake good enough to be my lunch.  Bacon Cheeseburger Milkshake -- http://bit.ly/2vLk12Q Strawberry Ice Cream drizzled with strawberry sauce and topped with whipped cream, a Mini Cheeseburger, Candy Bacon Strip, in a Chocolate Covered Mug with pretzel pieces and M&Ms. Just to be clear, there's no cheeseburger in the milkshake.  As you can see from the pic, the candy bacon strip and mini cheeseburger are both served outside the milkshake and were more like decorations.  Still though, just by looking at the pic, it's pretty damn insane!   The milkshake was good and I enjoyed the sweet and salty combined flavors when eaten with the mini cheeseburger, candied bacon, and pretzel pieces.  This is not something I'd order all the time but if you want shock value, this is one thing you can consider getting.  I ended up finishing at about 80 percent of the shake, so I was very satisfied!  Sugar Factory at the Fashion Show Mall is definitely a spot you want to check out for some shock value dining and drinking.  I would love to come back again to try more things from their menu.  Almost everything on the menu has some kind of playful Willy Wonka look to them and would be fun to enjoy either by yourself or with a group."}
{"text":"was very good. Took my daughter there for a birthday dinner. everyone's food was great service was good. we got there @ 5 and they have a good happy hr special. 1/2 off apps, burgers, pizzas, and drinks. i have bacon blu cheese mushroom burger . it was good. kids shared a pizza some fries, and chicken fingers, and of course a milk shake. I would take them there again. actually very reasonable price during happy hr."}
{"text":"Haven't gone back. Review had a reach out request from management. I wasnt sure if I was going to reply. I have wanted too; I've been looking for the contact information and can't locate it. They have seemed to disappoint yet again. Why remove the contact information"}
{"text":"A good place for kids. That pretty much sums it up the food is decent. I got a burger and fries, which were ok. Not really a place for adults in Las Vegas. Really touristy, which equals inflated overpriced. I will definitely be taking my daughter when we go to Las Vegas as a family. Take the family"}
{"text":"We went here for my birthday this year and I had the worst service ever. It took more than a half hour after we ordered to get our food while I was informed that my food was still being made. I ordered clam chowder and a personal pizza and never received my meal. The waiter was trying his best but it did not make up for the cold food that my family received or the fact that I never received my food. The beer was watered down as well which ended up with my food, my father's food, as well as the beers being taken off the bill. As I said before the waiter really tried his best and because he felt bad he created a goodie bag for me for my birthday and as an apology. All in all I will never go here again and I really don't recommend this place for people who are looking to dine in. (I would give this place zero stars but am unable to do so)"}
{"text":"First of all, the goblets had 8 shots. 8! So yea... off to a good start. Manny is absolutely amazing!! Very attentive and sweet as can be! Appetizers (Mac lollipops and wings) were delicious! Music was on point as well. Will come back just for Manny!!"}
{"text":"Awesome environment & great service, drinks are pretty dope. Dope date night theme & experience. Waitress (Adrian) was very on top of it & very courteous. Food definitely on point. Grey experience as a whole & I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to have a good time with there significant other. Unique experience for sure."}
{"text":"What the heck??? We are locals, and hoped to make this our regular date night. No way! What is happening here? No management available, slow, incorrect service, without a smile, and rush, rush, rush. With the price of those drinks, we should have been made to feel welcome. Food is just ok, nothing else. Left a message for management, never called or emailed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Medicore at best ..... food was cold, service was slow and there was only a handful of tables be careful ordering alcoholic drinks the goblets are $40 for sixty ounces of ice. The 60 ounce cup of  ice is brought  to the  table with a 16 ounce cup of  your beverage... my  partner ordered a vodka and cranberry and was charged  kettle one for 15 dollars I am sure that kettle one isn't the house  selection. I can not comment on dessert I opted out"}
{"text":"Okay so this has reopened in a new location and new menu.  When I first went when it was at Paris, it was great.  Then I went again under new owners and it was terrible.  Then it closed. Back in March my friend came to visit from NY and wanted desperately to come here.  I was skeptical but I figured it's a new location I will try it... It was really good. We all enjoyed our food, the menu is huge but a bit daunting.  We all bought candy at the adjoining store and a good time was had by all. We left full and happy."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE the old Sugar Factory restaurant so I was extremely happy to see it had opened up in a new location. I ate here with my family on our first night in Las Vegas after a 8 hour drive. Worst decision ever. The service was good, but the food was awful. 3 of us ordered the white chocolate burgers, which used to be our absolute favorite. I cannot stress enough how awful this was. Every burger had white chocolate drizzled ON TOP OF THE BUN. No where on the menu description does it mention that. None of us could pick up our burgers, and I got so frustrated eating mine I took a few bites and gave up. How do you expect us to eat a burger with chocolate drizzled on top? Our hands were completely messy, ruining the whole experience. We also ordered the dark chocolate french toast which was repulsive. It was soggy and mushy.   On the last day of vacation, I decided to order a salad to go. It sounded really delicious and I decided to give it a second chance. HUGE MISTAKE. The garbage salad was literally what it sounds like - garbage. The meats were so dry and the lemon dressing had a thick consistency, almost of mayo. The lettuce was soggy and I couldnt take more than a few bites. What also upset me was I called in the salad at my hotel. By the time I got there 20 minutes later, my salad was still not ready. Heres the kicker, there was NO ONE in the restaurant. Literally. So tell me why it took 40 minutes to throw cheese and meat on a salad? Seriously? There were servers sitting around talking and doing nothing but ignoring me. I had to go interrupt a group of servers and ask them to go check on my salad.   Overall, I would not ever recommend this restaurant. It used to be my favorite but unfortunately I will never return here again. Horrible food, horrible staff, and overall it was a horrible decision giving this new place a chance!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. Came here for brunch. And what I ordered was totally different than described in menu. I was taken aback when it arrived, the server asked are you allergic. Well no, I'm not allergic, but that shouldn't be the only question you ask. Then when your patron does not touch her food, you would think as a server you would inquire. Nope. Won't eat here again. :("}
{"text":"Very loud. Like a night club. Barely can hear.   Food good.  Turkey sandwich dry. Nothing special.  Calamari good.  Blue cheese burger great. Love it. Would have another burger for sure.  Salad ok"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! If you're looking for a quiet dinner, this is def not the place for you.  Very loud and energetic, fun for large crowds and even kids. We had a groupon for 8 people but had a party of 10 with us. The manager let the extra two partake in the groupon AND let us order WHATEVER we wanted from the menu instead of the limited groupon choices. Highly recommend this place to everybody. The staff were incredible and the food was plentiful and delicious! The $99 ice cream sundae was extremely over the top and the BEST ice cream I have ever had...mmmmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Came here for a smoking goblet while in town and, WOW, what a cute experience. From the restaurant layout to the actual menu, Sugar Factory is heaven for anyone with a sweet tooth. There's also plenty of places to stop and take pictures around the restaurant, which is cool.   We came during lunch. There were quite a few people, but we were able to sit upstairs without waiting. There's a great view of the Strip from up there, whether you opt to sit inside or out.   We ordered the Lollipop Passion goblet, the Grape Crush cocktail, and a mixed drink. These drinks, as sugary as they are, were reasonably strong. We noticed the shakes after ordering, unfortunately, or we would've probably snatched one of those up, too.  Yes, drinks and food are pricey, but that's honestly to be expected with the decor and theme of Sugar Factory. A goblet runs ~$30-$40. They know how to make that dry ice last! We had our drink for almost an hour, and it smoked the whole time. Food portions are on the smaller end. We didn't try the food, but we might just have to next time!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to The Sugar Factory for a few years now and came to this location on a whim. I didn't realize that this was sort of a soft launch for their grand opening which is tomorrow.   The drinks and candy are what they're known for, but the actual real star at this establishment was our server Brandon! It was quite busy and frantic (typical Las Vegas restaurant on the Strip), but Brandon made our experience a very memorable one. Not only is Brandon knowledgeable and cognizant of everyone's tastes at the table, but he was extremely personable and delighted us with his upbeat personality and sharp wit!  Thank you Sugar Factory for making a comeback & thank you Brandon for your service and pleasant disposition."}
{"text":"Two good things about this place was the managers were nice and the bussers were very attentive. Other than that it was very blah. The food was average the drinks were alright service was bad and the quality you would expect in a vegas brunch was not there especially with all the celebrities they have flashing on the wall I am sure they didn't serve Jamie Foxx French toast with the chocolate sauce in a plastic cup or molded strawberries overall disappointed my wife on her birthday"}
{"text":"I love the outdoor dining area and the location is super convenient if you're staying on the strip. Personally I've been dying to try this place ever since I've seen their lollipops plastered across social media by everyone and the ridiculously amazing milkshakes/drinks. So I took myself on a lunch date since I'm in town visiting.   Sat, got glared at an waited....  I ordered a goblet (I'm horrible with the names of the things that I order, but I promise to work on that y'all) it was super pretty and tasted ok. For 60oz, I'm on the fence about paying $40+ for a drink that had to be followed by a few more elsewhere to get me smiley. Then again, maybe I can blame that on my tolerance. I wanted another but didn't exactly feel comfortable nor too persuaded to order anymore. I also got a Cesar salad and added shrimp ($20) fairly small salad with 5 shrimp on top. Yummy but again, the pricing wasn't worth it to me. Especially after MORE WAITING. Wasn't busy around noon on Monday at all. My server was really sweet but I waited awhile before anyone acknowledged me at the table. Just men in uniforms with ear pieces...watching....  All in all, for $75 (tip included) I got a salad and drink, you're paying for the name and experience. Wasn't too impressed by the way I was treated as a guest. I really wanted to try an entree but will have to sadly pass."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, desserts underwhelming, terrible service. Happy hour drink prices are excellent. Mist likely won't be back. Too bad, had such high hopes! The only redeeming thing is that the food runner was dancing as he delivered food, nice to see an employee who enjoys his job."}
{"text":"Update: My husband and I came back to Sugar Factory Last night. The hostess outside seemed to be having a better day. We asked to be seated upstairs in the Chocolate Lounge.  When we arrived upstairs we learned one side of the outside was closed. (P.S. there were plenty of people under the age of 21 in the Chocolate Lounge)  We did get to sit by the windows though. The views were great. We both had a goblet drink. My husband didn't really like his, the candy berries gave a little bit of a bitter taste. Mine goblet was great. We both had the Sugar Factory Club sandwich. It was delicious."}
{"text":"We wanted to have a fun sugar experience at the chocolate lounge. When we walked in the upstairs it smelled like mold and the decor was underwhelming. Of all the items listed on the menu only 25% were actually available. Drinks were mediocre. I would not go back."}
{"text":"The food gets 5 stars, the prices get 2, so I'm settling on a 3.   I had never been to The Sugar Factory before, and needed to get a bite to eat before attending the wine walk in the Town Square last night. We ordered a cocktail each ($12) and two appetizers. We got the Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops ($10) and the bruschetta ($8).  The cocktails were on point for sure, and absolutely delicious, served in a stemless wineglass. The Root Beer Float tasted precisely like a rootbeer float! The Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops were delicious, the order came with three individual 'pops' that were about two inches around, a great size - with a manara dipping sauce. The crust was crisp and the inside was the best macaroni and cheese you could ask for, warm and gooey - amazing. The bruschetta arrived with 4 individual pieces on top of a balsamic drizzle. It was yummy.   Where you can normally grab two appetizers to tide you over for a bit, we left still hungry after $50. This place although delicious, has a ridiculous price point for what you receive portion-wise. A special occasion will bring me back, but nothing short of that."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and great service ! Also if your trying to get away from all the tourists on the strip this location is better for you. Can't wait to come back !"}
{"text":"Loved this place. I had the 4 cheese grilled cheese with the tomato soup and it was the best tomato soup I have ever had!! The drink menu looked incredible but didn't get to have one want to go back to try some. The waiter was great too and the food came quick."}
{"text":"As I sit here, eating chips and reflecting on my experience having my BIRTHDAY LUNCH at the new Sugar Factory, I am forced to wonder what would ever possess any restaurant owner to decide that their only vegetarian dish should be a freaking fishy tasting, soggy garden burger from a box. Also, I wonder why I am so hungry after literally just paying for a nice meal?  I have raved about the Sugar Factory veggie burger at the other location and I was beyond stoked that there would be a more easily accessible location at the Town Square. Finally a place to get these gourmet burgers that I'm in love with!   I will never visit this location again because I am so mad that they ruined my birthday by serving me a lazy garden burger and then executing it poorly on top of that. I know that vegetarians aren't the major focus in the business model, but if you are going to bother putting anything on your menu that is for vegetarians, you should make a half hearted effort to elevate it from the standard slop you can get at any bar or Denny's for 1/3 of the price. Then calling it an \"Ultimate\" veggie burger? Please. It is insulting to serve that in a restaurant that you claim is \"gourmet\".   Let me be clear, I understand that restaurants change their recipes and their menus. I totally get it. But this isn't a menu change, it is a bait and switch. You are promised an ultimate burger, but you are given crap that is readily available in a supermarket for less than $2. They didn't cook it, they heated it up. Infuriating.  The server was very nice, but inexperienced. No one found it suspicious that I didn't eat my \"ultimate\" veggie burger. I'm basically led to believe that this location is a cheap reproduction of the real thing and I am both starving and unimpressed.   Afterthought: Our phones actually did not work while we were in here so I don't know if they block service with a jammer or if Town Square was just too crowded... however I don't think your phone not working enhances the meal or the experience. Maybe they should call that \"ultimate\" internet? Boo, this place is an ultimate fail."}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but this place was so terrible I had to.  First of all I made the mistake of believing the positive reviews of this place.  I bought a Groupon for my family that included bottomless mimosas and food credit.  It took an hour to get the first mimosa. The food was so overpriced for what it was. (garbage) Our server Richard B., only saw him maybe twice the entire time.  Eggs Benedict came out with no hollandaise. Other entrees came out cold.  What hurt the most was the 18% on the bill of four people. This guy got a guaranteed 40$ tip for doing a terrible job.   This place was an atrocious experience for Fathers Day and I will do whatever I can to encourage people never to go here."}
{"text":"I have been to the miracle mile sugar factory, and it was no comparison to this one. Drake was awesome! So personable and made a delicious drink! And the drinks aren't the only candy... Drake is a nice piece of man candy himself."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere good food. Fun place to have some food. Had the ribeye steak. Food prices are a bit expensive but I think it's worth it.    The service was good. We will come back to try new foods for sure."}
{"text":"It was a fun experience but I doubt I'd return. Our server was great but I really felt the food was totally overpriced. We were a party of eight but I don't think any of the entrees we ordered were worth the price. My nephew ordered the grilled four cheese sandwich and tomato soup, he didn't even finish it...this is a teenage boy that finishes everything.  The salmon was tasty but so small. The place is gimicky and I really prefer a restaurant that focuses on food not gimmicks."}
{"text":"The Brie was amazing and the dinner delicious!  The staff was extremely nice and attentive!  Kristen was our waitress and she was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! I've been to the one in Orlando, FL before so nothing was a surprise. I had a Groupon for $40 toward our meal so I made sure that we stopped here. We got here at 7:30pm and it wasn't packed at all. We walked right in. You can make a reservation but you probably won't need it through the week. On the weekend, it's probably packed! Our server Manny was AMAZING! He was funny and he was very attentive! The service was perfect!  I order the caesar salad with shrimp and my boyfriend had a chicken sandwich and fries. Everything was delicious. But the thing to write about...the GOBLETS! I had the fuzzy peach mango and he had the gummy bear one. They are HUGE! It's about 2 1/2 drinks in just one goblet. They are very sweet with all the candy that's in them and they weren't very strong but they were still great. However, they are expensive! One goblet is $38 and you can't keep the goblet! That's kinda crazy if you ask me. The food isn't too bad price wise. My salad was $19. It can get loud in here...especially with the staff yelling when it's someone birthday and they deliver a dessert to the tables. Go and ask to sit in Manny's section!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place, and I was very disappointed! First, Open Table had allowed me to make an 8pm reservation at the Chocolate Lounge, but it was closed when we arrived (very strange, but not a big deal). We decided to have dessert at the Sugar Factory instead. We waited for about 10 minutes to have our order taken despite the restaurant being maybe 1/3 full. Not too long of a wait, but longer than I would have expected. However, next, we waited for 40 minutes for our dessert (ice cream cookie sandwich)- I finally caught the manager's eye to ask him if our order had been put in yet (our waiter, Chaz, had not been back to check on us that entire time!). The manager promptly got our dessert and refilled our waters for us. He very kindly went to grab us some spoons for our ice cream as well. About this time, Chaz came back over and had the audacity to ask us if we could use forks for our ice cream or if needed him to get us spoons. The manager was making his way back with the spoons just then, which was good because I don't know how I would have even answered that! If someone orders ice cream, it's always safe to assume he/she wants a spoon!! It felt so condescending! After all of that, the cookie was very dry- the ice cream was good, but the cookie kind of ruined the whole dessert.   When we were ready to leave, I waved my credit card in the air when I saw Chaz waking by to get his attention because he had managed to avoid eye contact with us for so long earlier in the evening. Chaz noticed we hadn't eaten much of the dessert and asked if it was subpar. We told him the cookie was pretty dry/tough, and he said he would let the manager know, but we told him not to worry about it because we were tired and just wanted to go. He just stood there like he didn't know what to do, then he ran our bill. No apology for the food or the wait, no thanking us for coming in, nothing- he just gave us our bill, watched us tip, and left. I gave 20% even though he did not deserve it just because I felt so awkward with him watching!   I appreciated the manager stepping in to fill our waters and get our food when our waiter was no where to be found- he was wonderful. Unfortunately, due to the quality of the dessert and the terrible service, I won't be back. Next time, I'll just grab an ice cream cone to go because the ice cream did look pretty delicious as we walked past it on our way out!"}
{"text":"Brunch wasn't as great as I was hoping. Although the photos look appetizing, the food is lacking in flavor and the service could be better.  We ordered steak and eggs and also the apple pie waffle. It all looked so good, then we took our first bites. The steak was under seasoned and the potatoes were bland. The waffle was actually really good. Crispy and the sugary.  Our server didn't check on us often, and one of our orders came out wrong. The restaurant was practically empty, so that wasn't even an excuse.   I think this place should stick to the sugary items and leave the savory stuff to the professionals. Totally over-rated place. Skip it!"}
{"text":"Brenda or server is great, very sweet. She made the experience. But if your not here for the alcohol it is a mediocre candy shop. The ice cream is nothing special, but the presentation is amazing"}
{"text":"Decided to visit the Sugar store since just wanted so take out ice cream and it is so hard to choose here what ice cream that one wants, since you usually want them all. I decided on the make a wish shake and had the bar add a shot of vodka too! The shake was great without the vodka but the alcohol made it so much more fun. Always impressed with the staff here were so professional and awesome to talk with."}
{"text":"After the 4.5 hour drive back from the Grand Canyon and a little hungry, but not too much given that hiking and the sun had certainly sapped us of resolve......  I've been dreaming about the Bacon Cheeseburger shake since I first saw photos of it a few weeks ago and this was my chance, since I don't like to eat late and it was already 10:00 pm by the time we dumped the car.  Sugar Factory was open until 12:00 am so we ran over there as fast as we could.    They have set up shop in the newer Fashion Mall on the lower level and ever since Serendipity left the coveted Caesars storefront and other than HEXX, there was no place that screamed \"Vegas\" on the north end of the strip.  The interior is a fusion between Willy Wonka + Moulin Rouge + Steampunk, which means you will enjoy sitting there while the music pounds away in the background.  Sugar Factory takes everything know for the American classics, such as sandwiches, burgers, milkshakes, and drinks and optimizes them.  And when I say, optimize, I really mean bigger and brighter.  For example, they have drinks here but instead of a typical cup, the drinks here come in goblets.  These are goblets you need to hold with two hand cupped around it, mind you.  There are no small drinks here.  And the vibrant colors induce rather than repel.  There was a table next to us that ordered the drinks with liquid nitrogen for the dramatic effect.  In this case, I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger strawberry milkshake and a Caesar Salad because that was exactly what I was craving.  Others in the party ordered the Turkey Avo Club sandwich and others ordered just drinks and wings.  The milkshake was everything that I was expecting and more.  The mini burger was even good, but the strawberry milkshake was a typical milkshake, not too fancy or out of this world.  My Caesar salad was fresh and crisp, exactly what I wanted after spending the day out in the sun exploring.  Not too heavy.  The Turkey Club looked good but seemed a little dry.  IE., there wasn't enough avocado on it and same with the tomato and lettuce.  I'm usually use to seeing stuffed sandwiches but this one lacked the filler and it looked a bit airy.  Overall, however, my friend enjoyed his sandwich and the french fries were a lightly seasoned shoestring kind.  We kept nibbling on these throughout the course of our evening.  Bear in mind that in the later hours of the day, this hotspot caters to a lot of groups celebrating birthdays so I wouldn't recommend bringing your little kids in around the 10-11 pm hours.  The music is awesome/dance but NSfK (Not Suitable for Kids).  Our staff person was very attentive and checked in on us at various intervals, which we appreciated.  Overall, a great experience so I'll be back for a quick bite/dessert in the late hours of the day when everything is closing."}
{"text":"I will say it's a little pricey but luckily we found on yelp 50% off our $40 drink.  Staff was all friendly and the food was really delicious and colorful I've never had bright colored cheeseburgers before in my life.   Jason was our server super friendly guy and the director of operations JOHN way way cool."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is trendy, food was very poor. Fettuccine Alfredo sauce must've came straight from a jar, ordered the angus filet medium rare came out dry must've sat under the heating lamp for a while before getting to us. They have a promotion if you sat outside food was 50% off go figure with Vegas summer heat which was tolerable for the food quality and pricing. Wait for service and food was a bit excessive. Silvia our server was very kind and apologetic, did everything she could to make our first experience a better one, kudos to her!"}
{"text":"We travel to Vegas often you can say and pass by the mesmerizing colorful sign all the time. I saw this Groupon deal for $25 towards $50 and it was well worth it that we used on 12/14. We ordered the French dip sandwich with tater-tots (a lil extra for tots), Signature Burger with White Chocolate bun with fries and the Lollipop Passion Goblet. All was delicious but of course the Lollipop Passion Goblet stole the show. The waitress was awesome and helpful since it was our first time there. I wish i could remember her name. She asked me if I wanted to take pictures of her pouring this special liquid into the goblet even. As soon as she poured it, there was fogging, steaming and bubbling...so FUN! I even took the candy bracelet home to eat it while I gambled LOL! After the bill came, there was still a balance of $40, which was from th Goblet which was $36....yikes! She gave us some white chocolate covered nutty thingy that was soo sooo yummy. Also, Connected to the restaurant they have a very fun candy store! I found the stash of that same white choc covered yummy and bought some to go...oink oink!  Buffets are always great but it's nice to try other dining options! I would definately recommend this on a girl's night out or even a date."}
{"text":"I just experienced the worst customer service ever today. First of all it was my birthday, I made a reservation for a table of 15!!!! ( expecting my table to be ready and set up ) which it was not , I arrived at my reservation time which was 7pm and no one helped us at first ?? Second they didn't have our table set up ??? our waiter was completely rude he seemed like he really didn't care what we had to say or ask, so as the night went on I thought it was get a little better one of my friends ordered a steak  medium rare ( came out almost well done) , so she asked the waiter about the steak and about getting a new one and this was his response ( I work at a steakhouse for my second job I know what medium rare is ) which in a professional restaurant like that you should always make the customer HAPPY no matter what !!!! never came around !! Asking how was everything , no refills nothing only until everyone saw us getting annoyed!!! When I called and made a reservation I said \" everyone will be splitting checks \" and when it was time for the bill they didn't even bring the bill out !?!? Until like 25 mins plus !!! And they bill wasn't split up !!!! MY MOM SPLIT UP THE BILL HERSELF using her phone calculator !! Between 15 people !!! And not once did anyone come up to us and say if we needed help or anything or how we could figure it out !!! Nothing JUST RUDE RUDE RUDE DUMB PEOPLE AND IM FROM VEGAS AND OUT OF ALL PLACES THE STRIP HAD THE WORSE SERVICE !! Get outta here bad location"}
{"text":"What an Amazing Experience!! We (party of 6) came here to celebrate the 12th Birthday of my friends daughter, Ashley. She was so amazed by the dry ice effect in her non-alcoholic goblet. Then even MORE AMAZED (as were the adults) by the \"show\" that was put on by the staff when delivering the Signature 24 scoop King Kong ice cream sundae!!!   All lights go dim and the restaurant goes quite. Suddenly, fun dance/club music starts playing. Our waiter starts walking with a HUGE sundae (with sparklers) in hand and behind him a line of other staff members. Once they arrived to our table they begin to sing Happy Birthday. IT WAS AMAZING!  The smile on Ashley's face was Priceless!   A huge THANK YOU SHOUT OUT to Marc (our server) and Amanda (Manager on duty)!!! Your service was so much appreciated!"}
{"text":"We came to the town square location because we had a groupon deal and it is much better than the paris location. They have a kid's menu and the prices are a less. No wait, not loud and a more family friendly environment. Our server Jessica was great! She went over the menu and gave us some suggestions on what to order. She even gave the kids some candy before our meal and they loved that! We will definitely recommend this location to our friends and family! Post a review on Yelp and get a $10 gift card for your next visit! P.S. Try the Cookie Jar for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the drinks are huge and awesome. The only bad thing I can say about this place is people that work there are snobby and they lack in customer service. Also the prices on the menus are on the pricey side. But other than that it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We had been really looking forward to dining here and walked quite a distance just for it. It was our last Vegas restaurant experience on that trip and we expected it to be the cherry on top. It was a HUGE disappointment. HUGE!  I know it's \"Sugar\" Factory, so I won't be complaining about the murdering sweetness of the drinks, though I did feel the entire evening afterwards how that sugar clod was just sitting in my stomach causing uneasy sickness. But that's expected from a candy-themed restaurant, even though a couple next to us returned their goblet due to that very reason.  What I did not expect was that ALL three dishes we ordered (Mediterranean salad ($16),  Buffalo chicken sandwich with fries ($17) and Pacific Salmon ($29)) were unacceptably OVERSALTED. In fact, so terribly that I couldn't eat my salad at all and my husband had to ask them to take it back. My mom couldn't finish her salmon and it's still in the box. I know food is usually oversalted when it's about to go bad, but the salad seemed fresh, so I simply don't understand such unnecessary cruelty on the cook's part. Just.WHY? Moreover, our drinks had no alcohol in them. Like At All. We were told the goblet ($40) would have about 8 shots. 8 shots of syrup, obviously, not alcohol. The other drinks (Watermelon Burst martini and Sexual Chocolate strawberry ($17 each)) were also just that: sugar. No alcohol. For a $130 dinner (the salad was taken off the bill) that's just unacceptable. It spoiled the whole impression from the trip. The entire evening I regretted coming here and polluting my body with all that sugar and salt. For comparison a small restaurant Ocean One Bar and Grille inside Planet Hollywood got us deliciously full and drunk for just $48.64. Three DELICIOUS HEALTHY dishes, 1 appetizer and 7 great drinks! I HIGHLY recommend everyone to check it out instead of this sugary grave."}
{"text":"Horrible! I would never come back. A horrible, small and overpriced steak au poivre. Theu fill out your plate with tons of fries to fool you with the miserable size of the steak. 3 times I had to ask for my aoda to be changed because it tasted horrible and then we couldn't eat dessert because they were sold out!! Unbelievable how the quality changed compared to when it was at Paris. It was a total rip off!"}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!! The waitress, Bettye, couldn't get anything correct on our order. She never apologized for all of the mistakes she made. The manager, Miguel, came to the table being sarcastic regarding our issues with the meal we ordered. I will NEVER come back and waste my money in this place again!!"}
{"text":"The drinks were yummy, and pretty strong! They are extremely sweet, but what you would expect from a candy store. My husband and I shared a 60oz drink and it was plenty!"}
{"text":"i actually really enjoyed this place but was just a bit disappointed that the groupon i bought made me feel like i was being treated as a less appreciated customer by the waiter  the food was really good and the goblets were amazing :)"}
{"text":"Went to Town Square location.  Food was adequate...drinks only slightly watered down.  Used a Groupon and what a waste...drinks are outrageously priced!  $22 for a double rum and coke..off the strip at a place that does groupons?  Holy wallet pillaging!  NEVER again will I go here....you've been warned."}
{"text":"Sugar Factory. Where all of your sweet desires can be consumed. From \"Goblets\" of cocktails to lavish ice cream sundaes, to crazy milkshakes, they also have a variety of food options to choose from.  After a couple of days of non stop drinking, I decided to lay off the booze. Although they are known for their Goblets (60 oz concoction of colorful, vibrant cocktails) I decided to skip the massive \"buzz\" and opted for something that had no alcohol. Their Milkshakes caught my attention.  Giggles Snickers Milkshake: For some reason by looking at all their desserts, I had the assumption that everything was going to be overwhelmingly sweet. To my surprise, the milkshake tasted fantastic. It was nice, creamy, and thick. It had a great oreo flavor, and I kept scooping away at the whipped cream and sprinkles. It was perfect. The presentation was exquisite. The mug was covered in chocolate with a rainbow of sprinkles and bits and pieces of Snickers everywhere. There was also a caramel waffle to top it off! SWEET! 5/5  I'll have to come back again to get sugar wasted with their Goblet's!"}
{"text":"Where should I start. The service. Probably the worst services experience of my life. We had to be beg for our waitresses attention which is crazy since we are a party of 10 ! Once we ordered several of our guests received there food late or about 45 min after everyone else. The food arrived cold! I even took the time to let the waitress know that the service was bad and all she did was agree with me ! So not call for a manager or nothing. We paid our bill and will never be returning. It's probably the reason that sugar factory has had 3 failed attempts in Nevada!"}
{"text":"So I can only give a review on what I saw...right up until I didnt. I'll explain: We were in the Towne Square area and saw this place the night before, but were with friends across the way, but decided to check them out the next day. Searched for them online, and found (like it says here) that they open at 10:30. We promptly arrived at 10:25 and the place was dark. Double checked the website..yep..10:30. Waiting...10:45 a girl arrives and starts her work at the hostess counter. Approached, asked for a table for 3..and were told they dont open till 11. Well nuts. \"You guys should fix you're information on your website about your times, people actually use that to look you up\"...blank stare...waiting...10:57 they take us in and seat us...inside the place is pretty cool with candies in dispensers making up an entire wall, very modern deco, etc, menus delivered with hostess. Our waiter, Max, promptly appears, asks us if we have ever been there, informs us of the specials and of the drink specials...and then leaves...without asking if we would actually like to have any drinks....smh...whatever...start looking over the menu. Some VERY interesting looking drinks, some interesting food ideas I would like to try....and waiting...only my party and two other parties here now...waiting...11:10 I can see what appears to be the clean cut manager in the suit around late 20's early 30's walking around inspecting this and that making sure everything is ready for the days business, except if his guests are actually being taken care of...no sign of Max for the last 12 minutes...waiting...11:15 we leave. Clearly they dont have their act together, and with the prices they are asking for on their menu, I would assume some semblance of customer service would come with it. Ciao baby."}
{"text":"Its raining Sugar up in He A!  Seriously this place is a sugar addicts dream shop.  Everything here is sweet and sugary.  Came here to redeem one of the My Vegas coupons.  I felt high on sugar the whole time I was in there and I didn't even have any candy.  I picked up some chocolate rocks, malt balls, chocolate covered pretzel and green cotton candy!   Since I don't have a sweet tooth these were all brought into the office to be shared.   Eyes ~ So many candies and sweetst! Nose ~ Smells sweet!. Ear ~ Enjoying the music they have playing. Mouth ~ Chocolate rocks taste yum!. Tummy ~ Must not eat too much!"}
{"text":"Sugar factory is always enjoyable for me. I live in the Las Vegas area and when I need a break from work life I relax with a signature cocktail or share a fishbowl.  That staff and bartenders are not just friendly, but very energetic. The environment is always upbeat and entertaining enough for me to appreciate my night out.  Maria was my bartender at the town square site and she was one of the nicest and most attentive that I've had.  I definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Place is nice, people are nice but the food sucks balls .. no flavor whatsoever. Ordered the spinach dip and it taste so bad, the chicken fingers my sons ordered were hard to bite and stringy (double yuck) I would go just for the experience of those alcohol drinks. My husband ordered a bubbling drink and it taste like big o fountain soda but that was it. I wouldn't go back for the food that's for sure.  Oh their super fast to bring out the food like VERY fast.  We were shocked maybe that's why the food tasted so bad .. stale French fries found at Sugar factory"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place and was extremely disappointed. Went to get a goblet which was $38 dollars  (which i knew) but you do not get to keep the glass.  You can get a cheap plastic knock off for $15. The drink itself was way to sugary.  Drank the whole thing and no buzz just a headache from sugar overload.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"Took my 13 year old daughter wasn't looking at prices nor were they on menu for goblet drinks but I was shocked to find out Virgin goblet was $34 but ok I get it (unique drink) but about $14 more then I would expect but for $150 lunch date the food was not good, cheap, over sauced crepes, pasta was ok but like spaghetti factory, soggy crepes....if I had gone on a Groupon I'd prob think I got what I paid for....I just saw I paid $6 for an ice tea which was never refilled & was in a small glass, which prompted my review because $6 for ice tea is over the top, tipped $23 according to their suggestion on checkout computer tablet which was awkward as waitress stood waiting, staff were nice but someone started sweeping at my feet cleaning while we were still hanging out which was rude, total bill was $143.74 for 2....OUCH!  Drinks are cute but overall it was a major let down...but I should know anyone running a Groupon needs business that was my 1st clue only wished they weren't sold out on Groupon for 2 so I could have paid what it was worth."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else.. seriously. For starters, the service was incredibly slow -_- staff more people on a Friday night, I waited an hour for a drink, and another hour for food!! Every time I wanted to ask the waitress for something I had to go walking around the restaurant looking for her and eventually ask someone else, who were also too busy to help. The food was nothing special, and the drink was good but WAY over priced. I don't get the hype but will never go back to find out."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and the service and food is great consistently. Our waiter Richard was awesome! He checked on us frequently for anything else we needed and had a great attitude.  The goblet and shakes is a must try. The burgers are monstrous! Love it! I recommend you experience it yourself."}
{"text":"The Sugar Factory is a fun and whimsical place to grab lunch; brunch or insane milkshakes.  I am not kidding about the insanity of the milkshakes; one.comes garnished with a cheeseburger, another is garnished with cheesecake.  There are also a billion choices for rainbow colored, confectionary laden alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.  Many are served in fish bowls and are bubbling due to a small amount of dry ice being put into the drinks.   I had a caesar salad, my children had pasta dishes and my husband had a burger.  It was all passable but I have to say everything was over seasoned.  The fries were delicious but salty enough to cause chapped lips.  Maybe their menu is too large to cook anythinf with precision.  It kind of reminded me of the cheesecake factory in that respect.  The menu was huge!  We enjoyed watching all of the crazy concoctions at the tables around us. The decor was pure whimsy with  chandeliers and an amazing duck shaped disco ball.  Is it even called a ball if shaped like a duck.  Really it was a fun lunch but the food just wasnt that good."}
{"text":"sugar factory- I've bookmarked this place for a while now. I have been dying to try their goblet drinks and finally decided to get one since we were staying across the street. We entered on the first floor and were asked if we wanted to be seated upstairs in their chocolate lounge. We agreed and were led up the elevator into the lounge. The first floor seemed like it was more for families because there were lots of families that night with their kids. We wanted a quieter area so the lounge was perfect!   We ordered the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito and the Hazelnut chocolate fondue. The watermelon mojito was filled with frozen raspberries, watermelon gummies, and a lot of rum. They were pretty generous with their rum and that was all I could taste. I also don't think the watermelon and rum mixed well together. I wish I got something else. But the overall performance of delivering the goblet out and pouring the drink into the frozen ice at the bottom, creating this mist/fog effect was truly IG worthy. $39 per goblet.   The hazelnut chocolate fondue was a big disappointment. The chocolate was not creamy at all and it didn't taste like hazelnut. Not sure if they gave us the wrong fondue but it tasted a bit like dark chocolate and bitterness. I was not impressed with the fondue. It came with mini marshmallows, mini gummy bears, pretzel bites, strawberries and bananas. Not only did the chocolate not taste good, but the gummy bears and pretzel bites did not pair well with the chocolate. For $26, I expected the fondue to really hit the spot.   Overall, the experience was fun but the food and drinks were mehhh. The service was also mehh as well. We asked some questions regarding the menu and the person didn't know and didn't come back to us until 15 minutes later. We had 3 different servers the whole time we were there. They weren't very helpful nor were they attentive either. I wish the food and service was better so I can go back."}
{"text":"jayden!!! the bomb.  he's the best bartender. i think we sat at the bar for hours. we're coming back to tomorrow during his shift...just to see him again. so cool!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sugar Factory on the strip several times and I am never pleased with the service they provide. I work at a restaurant as well so I know how it works. However, when I went into Sugar Factory Town Square the experience was different! Brandon was an amazing server and super nice. I told him about my past experiences at Sugar Factory and told him to prove me wrong and he did! Thanks Brandon! The manager on this evening even seemed genuine when he checked in on us, unlike the ones at the strip location. The s'more hot chocolate was definitely worth the splurge in calories! (:"}
{"text":"It took about 15 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge that we were at the bar. There were about 10 people total in the bar so it was not busy whatsoever. The bartender, Enrique, then waited another 5-10 minutes to ask us for our drinks. After that, he prepared the tables drink first and delivered it before making ours.   When making small talk, he asked where we were from and when we said Vegas, he proceeded to tell us we gave off the tourist vibe. He was very awkward with his small talk.   At some point a hostess showed up at the door to greet people and show them to a seat.   Overall, it was a horrible experience and would not recommend it. The only redeeming quality was the variety and flavor of the drinks."}
{"text":"The food was very low quality, for the price. The bathrooms were filthy The waitstaffs uniforms were filthy Overall it was very underwhelming! We went to celebrate my Birthday and they charge for EVERYTHING! We can understand paying for he cake but they charge $10 for the candle/sparkler."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous time at this extraordinary restaurant! From the simply perfect Bruchetta to the phenomenal bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Mary's .. This staff made sure to make us feel like we belonged here! Starting with our beautifully sweet Gia to our wonderful server Matthew aka \"MGM\", to the sweet and sassy Monique.. and the owner Scott making sure to show he truly cares about his service.. absolutely recommend this wonderful dining experience to everyone!"}
{"text":"We recently had a Sunday funday at Sugar Factory in Town Square and had a pretty good time.  It started off a bit shaky because it took about 20 mins before anyone took our order, but our waiter definitely made up for it by giving some of the best customer service around. We had brunch with bottomless mimosas and he never let us run out.   The food was okay but let's be honest, we were there for the alcohol.  Sugar Factory wouldn't be my first choice, but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was a planned event..went with large party..ordered dinner took 45 min to an hour to serve..1 waitor..and many orders with incorrect or missing food..no apologies from manager for late/wrong food orders..never again go there..plus they added their gratuity to your bill automatically..LOOK OUT"}
{"text":"Food was tasteless, way to overpriced for what you get.  Customer service was good but won't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience. The food, drinks & dessert were delicious!!! Thoroughly enjoyed the upbeat and fun environment!! Loved it!  \"Briana\" provided excellent customer service.  We shall return.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"First of all the waitress confirmed my order of the app of my sampler and after 25 minutes it still didn't come, I had gotten my main food and she didn't mention anything about the app, she tried to apologize and give it to us for free but it was pointless, she wasn't attentive and her name is Sylvia, she's a bad waitress and doesn't pay attention to problems. I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Dessert bar/restaurant located in front of the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is like an old ice cream parlor meets modern luxury.  To start I had one of their famous smoking goblets. I had the watermelon mojito. The goblets are very large at 60 ounces and are shareable. My goblet was yummy and continued smoking for about 30 minutes, when I finally finished it.  The food menu is pretty large and includes brunch, lunch, and dinner. I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It was good.  Lastly we could not leave without trying dessert. We got the snickers milkshake which was obnoxiously large and came in a candy coated glass. Again, easily shareable. It was delicious and I slipped into a sugar coma the rest of the afternoon."}
{"text":"I've come here on two separate occasions before tonight and have always had a great time. Tonight was a very different experience. We showed up at 10:30 pm for ladies night which I was told minutes before we showed up that it was still going on. When we arrived we were informed that it ended at 9 pm. When I called the day before I was told that ladies night began at 9 pm. I was then informed by the bartender that ladies night was from 7-9 pm. Fine. We decided to still dine there for dinner. The server took forever, when he did finally come he got my order wrong. Then as we were leaving, a bartender yelled out \"have a good night\" but three out of the four of us were already out the door and the last girl barely heard what he said so she didn't respond. So in turn, he then yelled out \"fine, don't have a good night.\" Tonight was a joke and I would think twice about attending 'ladies night' at this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was great and our waiter was such a doll. He found out we were in Vegas for a bachelorette party and at the end of our meal he brought a huge ice cream platter for us to share. He surprised us by dimming the lights in the whole restaurant and brought the platter out with flares. But aside from that if you guys aren't coming for a special occasion this place will still make you happy. The plates are HUGE and the service is great, they were constantly asking us to go if we needed anything; they even asked one of my friends if she wanted a new drink when she didn't like the one she ordered. Make sure to visit this place if you are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing...... over priced for what we experienced. food tasted old , gummy candy was hard as hell. Only plus was our waitress. Wanted to have a lovely Father's Day dinner with friends and family. Never again......"}
{"text":"Brought my girls here all for the first time for a bachelorette dinner & we loved it so much. Very clean, fancy, everything is GREAT. Very pricey but what do you expect from a restaurant on the strip. Lol Love!"}
{"text":"The host was very nice that was outside & told us to go in & the other inside would seat us. We walked inside & there was no one there to greet us & stood there for 5mins before anyone spoke to us & there was a host walking around waiters and even the manger. We finally stopped the host and asked her if we could get seated and we had a reservation. She sat us and gave us the menus and walked about, no apologies for having to wait or even a smile. We were greeted by our host who didn't tell us or know about the specials or happy hour I just happen to hear it from another waitress that told her customers next to us! Not a good start. But the drinks are really fun & the food was just ok. Better customer service would've been great."}
{"text":"The goblets are amazing, super fun and tasty. One goblet is enough to share with another person. We had a great time here, the music is great... end blasting lol. Our server, Brandon, was great! He had good food and drink recommendations, very nice and friendly.   I would definitely come here with my family and friends. Good drinks, good food, good vibes, and all around a great time!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the the Sugar fatory club !! And make a wish shake!! Yummy!!   Excellent service Drinks are uber tasty and the food is fresh and satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the drinks are pretty but expensive, I can't even remember if the food was good but the place is definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"Love the factory.  During the week it's always happy hour.  Half price drinks from 6 to  10 and their 4 cheese pizza is one of my favorite pizzas in town.  Nessa always treats us well.  If I don't feel like pizza I get the Brie and turkey.  Thick juicy turkey and succulent melted Brie.  This is definetly my spot in Town Square"}
{"text":"If it were possible to give something less than one star, I would. If you have a reservation here, cancel it! If you don't have a reservation here, don't make one! I just returned home after an early Mother's Day brunch with my daughter and granddaughter. Between the three of us, we ordered brioche French toast with assorted berries, pancakes with caramelized pecans, and fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. We asked that the chocolate drizzle and whipped cream be left off both breakfast items. When our food finally arrived, there were no pecans on the pancakes, and the brioche French toast looked as though it had been prepared literally in a toaster rather than on a grill-the crust was completely burnt. How does that even happen on the grill? There were barely 3 edible bites in the center. Additionally, both items had chocolate drizzle and whipped cream on them. Also, the promise of warm syrup is not to be believed. Apparently, only cold syrup exists here. No matter, since both items were barely worth eating. The fettuccine had chicken rather than shrimp and the waiter forgot the garlic bread that was to have come with that dish. Normally, we say nothing and don't return to restaurants if something even remotely close to this happens. Today, I did tell the waiter that the cook was probably going to cost him tips since every dish was wrong. His response was \"I'm sorry, did you want your check now?\"completely amazing. What should have been a delightful once-a -year celebration was completely ruined by the inept performance at this establishment."}
{"text":"It was my first time in Vegas and we found a Groupon for this place. I'm so glad we did.. The food, ambiance and service was amazing and made our trip memorable. Their goblet drinks are super delicious and picture worthy. We tried the cheese board to start, a monster cheesy burger (comes with mac & cheese on it!) and fetttucine Alfredo. Everything was delicious and I wish I could remember our server's name because he was so great, even put our drinks in to go cups with extra gummy worms before we left. I highly recommend this spot for a delicious and memorable meal."}
{"text":"This store is a sugary disappointment. The only reason it's getting 1 star is the good is actually pretty good. The service is worse than the most piss poor restaurant I've ever been to in my life. Just gawd awful. The first time I went there w 2 friends. Place was dead.. Took 1:05 to get my appetizer and the manager came over after walking by our table 10 times and smiling like a jackass. He then offered to comp part of our bill for the fact we hadn't yet received our order. That's the only reason we gave it a second chance. Went back again yesterday. Service was worse than the first time. Disappointing for such a cool themed restaurant and decent food."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!! Sat forever and NO ONE said hello, offered drinks, or even acknowledged us. We were on the top deck. The waitresses upstairs made it a point to not make eye contact with us so that they wouldn't have to help. Initially, there was some type of confusion between the waitresses and the hostess regarding our seating, but that shouldn't have affected the service we received. We were told by the hostess that they wanted to give our table to someone else.  The male hostess guy out front with the curly hair was super cool and helpful, but I'll never visit again. Two thumbs down. There was also a guy on the elevator with some sort of microphone in his ear but I'm not sure of his position. He over heard our complaints about not being helped and said absolutely nothing. It was our first time there and we only went in after being asked to by the hostess outside. We were actually trying to go to the Benihana's next door. I've now read several reviews on the horrible customer service (mainly the wait staff). Guess I should've read up before we agreed to going in. DON'T WASTE YOUR  $$ HERE!"}
{"text":"This is a review of the Sugar Factory Kiosk inside of the Fashion Show Mall. Not sure why Yelp is showing the wrong address. Anyways, horrible service. Got thirsty while shopping and saw that they had a juice bar. All the options seemed light and refreshing, though I think it's a bit overpriced at $5 for 24 ounces of sugary water infused with bits and pieces of fruit and herbs. Got a pineapple mint juice after trying a sample. While my mom is paying, the lady fills up the cup and I see that she has stuffed a huge clump of ice inside the cup. The ice literally fills up three quarters of the cup. I ask her right there and then to not give me so much ice but she ignores my request and says it's supposed to be like that. She tops off with a little bit of juice, caps it and tries to stick a straw in. The straw will not go in because cup is packed with so much ice. We complain once again and every one at that kiosk from the cashier to the manger keeps repeating there is supposed to be ice in this. Well dull, I'm not complaining about the fact there is ice, I have issue with how MUCH ice there is. As to be expected, the drink after all the ice started melting was totally diluted with hardly any taste left. These people have no shame and no sense of customer service. After searching for this business on yelp, I realize it's part of a franchise. Will definitely make sure to stay away in the future."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to come to this place since it's always below one of my fave CLUBS in LV.  But we never get the chance to eat here or at least stop by.  Finally a chance to try the place since it's my son's bday on Tuesday and so we had a lunch date there and he had always wanted to eat there.  Got there after Noonish.   A lot of people but not much wait- only 10 min.  While we waited we looked around the store area but not too much since we were hungry and didn't want to buy everything we see.  I asked for a table outdoors so we can people watch and I got confirmation the heaters were on since it was super cold.  We got seated and the heater next to us was not on.  The waitress (she was very nice)- tried to turn it on for us.  While we studied the menu the waitress tried to turn on the heaters in the other area....so we moved closer to those heaters.   ***(The heaters turned off after 5 min)**** We ordered the *FRIED MAC/CHEESE...which was delicious.  The consistency was delectable and I can even picture it better if it had crab in it. My son had *CHICKEN ALFREDO- which tasted very buttery and with plenty of chicken.  Exactly what my son loves.  I ordered the *FRENCH DIP- which was full of the most tender roast beef and very moist almost like butter.  It could use a lil more salt but it was good it wasn't too salty.  Easier to add salt than to take it away.  The fries was good too.  (dang was we that hungry that everything tasted good??????  LOL)  ****that dang heater--the waitress has assured us the heaters were out of propane DUH!...and some guy was coming to refill it and we'll be good soon.  We finished out food, paid the bill THEN the propane man actually came and started filling up the propane tanks.   Luckily the sun peeked between these two hotels and we got a lil sunheat while we were eating...Thank You G.   Paid the bill - gave her a good tip since she was a good attentive waitress.   The food was good and I was thinking it was gonna be expensive and paying for the location and that food was gonna stank.  - NO....it was worth the price, the view of the Bellagio fountains, able to people watch, and good staff minus the slow -ass propane man.   Yes we could have sat indoors- but we were assured the heaters were on.  We could have been asked if we would like to move indoors - but we were not.   Even if we had thick jackets and everything it would have been nice...but who wants to eat with all that clothing.    I tried to go on the SUGAR FACTORY online to comment on our experience but I could not find a link for customer comments.    The store part- it was fun to look at everything and I just want to buy everything.   So we just bought some  pop rocks and the lip tattoo.   ---can't wait to try the lips."}
{"text":"Low quality ingredients, terrible powder hot chocolate, lukewarm coffee, and all overpriced. Not worth it. This isn't the same Sugar Factory from three-four years ago."}
{"text":"I have been hearing about this place for a long time. The problem with this \"impulse\" visit since we were in Town Square was not reading the Yelp reviews beforehand. They seemed to range from 1 star...those who came for the food to 4/5 stars...those interested in the alcohol. This spot (which used to be the Meatball Spot and prior hookah lounge) has been plagued with restaurant failures. I was hoping that a known strip brand would finally break that cycle, but it sadly did not.  My daughter pointed out that most of the wait staff are \"good looking\", which seems to trump decent service. Albeit a very nice staff, no one seemed to have any real service industry substance. I asked our server about menu items and popularity and got a generic response. My order came out wrong the first time and small things like a side of ranch dressing with our fries were quickly forgotten items. I ordered what was the most disgusting thing I've eaten in a long time. The chicken caesar crepe looked promising but left me feeling nauseous, even as I write this review. It is presented as a crepe filled with a thick alfredo-like sauce with pieces of chicken served alongside a creamy caesar salad...with chicken. Why? I don't know. I only took a couple bites and it took every ounce of willpower not to gag. My daughter and wife both had the buffalo chicken sandwich. My wife enjoyed it, but my daughter said it was too tangy for her taste. An unfortunate dining experience when the best part was the fries. We saw most of the patrons enjoying a large smoking alcoholic beverage...what this place is known for. It's Sugar should just remove food from their agenda altogether and only serve drinks. Our bill came to $55 for 2 chicken sandwiches and 1 gross crepe. Sigh, really hate being disappointed in food and ripped off when dining out. I don't like the fact they will be opening up a location at the Galleria Mall because there are so many other worthy establishments. NEXT!!!"}
{"text":"Run! This place is so NOT what it's hyped up to be. They must pay up the wazoo for these celebs to promote this kind of crap. The food was bland, the wait was long, and the service sucked balls, literally we got 2 visits from our server and never saw him again UNLESS he was tongue kissing the ass's of the larger parties around us."}
{"text":"Beyond Terrible service. The waiters and waitresses are like clueless zombies. Bad for kids. No kids menu. Not kid friendly- don't get fooled. This is not a place to bring your kids except for the candy store. Cute decor but that is about it.  Food is barely edible. Everything we ordered came wrong. To top it all off, they gave us someone else's check.  Total waste of money. Gimmicky."}
{"text":"My sister & I were in the area yesterday & decided to have lunch here. We decided to dine outside because it was beautiful out. Our server's name was Brittany. Although it was lunch time, the service was horrible. We waited forever for everything. Food, refills, check, everything took forever. The table next to us, who had a different server, was constantly asking \"where's our server?\" as well. We had the Fried Macaroni & Cheese. The macaroni & cheese itself was good but the breading was just okay and somewhat soggy. My sister had the pasta and it was not worth the money. The portion was super small and it was not that great. I had the Club Sandwich. The fries were good and the sandwich was just okay."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience at Sugar Factory very much. The food was delicious and the drinks were amazing! But the best part, in my opinion, was the excellent service! Our waiter was great, and everyone who came by our table was so friendly. I loved our experience there and would definitely go back my next time in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my experience here. Our server forgot to ring in our appetizer, and never even apologized for his mistake. When we tried to order food, no one in the store could tell us what was in the veggie patty ( not even the manager) . The server didn't check on us once. When it came time to pay, the sever dropped the wrong check. Very unorganized and the manager acted like he didn't care when we spoke to him after paying. I definitely wont be coming back ."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this evening's dinner at Sugar Factory. I had been to the one at the Paris Hotel last year, and when I saw a Groupon for this location... I knew it was a must! We paid $30 for $62 worth of food and beverages! It's such an amazing deal! But it's not good for desserts. We ordered: an American Honey drink for $12, a frozen hot chocolate for $9, the chicken parmesan for $17, and the steak bernaise frites for $25. After our Groupon, we paid $6 plus tip.  The drinks were SOOO delicious!  The food was good, too! The server was friendly, but she was quite busy with a lot of tables. Understandable. It took a little bit for our food order to get to us, but our drinks came out really quickly! But it was okay... as we weren't in a hurry and were enjoying our drinks.  Seriously... buy the Groupon. SOOO worth it! :D"}
{"text":"This place has some really awesome treats and the food was good as well. Nice place to take the family. There's a restaurant abnd a retail side.  I didn't make it into the retail part.  The service was awesome and I they poured my alcohol drink to go silver I didn't finish it all with my meal. I hope to be back again soon."}
{"text":"The dessert was great...now the rest of the story. We got seated quickly enough and the atmosphere was really good. We quickly noticed how hot it was and were informed that the air wasn't working. It was 109 outside so definitely uncomfortable. We ordered and then waited at least 45 minutes for our desserts to arrive. Yes, we only had dessert! The service was horribly slow only made worse by the sweltering heat! The tables were absolutely filthy! I won't ever go to this location again!"}
{"text":"The drinks are great!! However was there 6/4/18 @2:30pm and server Jacob S, check #117 took an extra 20% off my credit card on top of the tip we gave him in cash.  We signed the computer with no tip and gave him cash and still took an extra 20%. That is bad Karma. If you go there watch your tip as this is a great way to scam extra money from people. It was a prepaid card and that is how I know bc I went to make another purchase and there should have been $24.22 on there and there was $9.09. What a joke!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome... my friends and I were shocked on the atmosphere and the customer service. The chefs, Chris and Alejandro were amazing. We left full and satisfied. If you haven't eaten here before, you are totally missing out. I will definitely return! !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. Really wanted to love it since we attended to celebrate my sister's bachelorette party. A few of the things we experienced: -one of the slowest services in the Vegas strip. Service was so slow that while walking to the bathroom I witnessed a party simply walk away after saying they were waiting for 2 hours for their food. It took 50 minutes for our drinks to be delivered to our table. -the layout is awful. Servers have a hard time moving around between the tightly squeezed table, slowing down service even more. -room is uncomfortably hot. -bartender couldn't answer a simple question such as \"what kind of red wine do you have?\" -food quality was awful, high school cafeteria type of food.  The positive? The design makes this place seem kid friendly since it's all about candy and sweets, and the bar is decorated like a carousel.  Never coming back. No wonder their other location closed."}
{"text":"Shopping at fashion show mall today and i had a groupon for Sugar Factory. Always heard and saw the amazing drinks so decided to give it a try.  The inside is super cute and trendy. Lots of chairs and tables for big groups or even smaller intimate party sizes. The menu is super huge with lots of choices so dont get too overwhelmed. Lots of colorful and fruity drinks for the overwhelming goblet sizes. We opted to share the Raspberry Watermelon Mojito ( it was okay wish i chose something else) if you check into Yelp you get any goblet drink for half off. Steal!!!!  Besides the food and drinks i would have given it more stars but the service and the surrounding activites with the other staff was challenging. For example the buss boy was mopping right in our area where ourselves and other guests were eating and drinking as well as a walkway for patrons and servers moving back and forth with the aroma of clorox on the side very unappetizing. I dont see why the mopping was needed at that very moment when there were no spills that needed to clean up. As soon as he finished  (i told my girlfriend this was going to happen) an employee slipped and fell. Good thing she didnt get hurt too bad and right after her a guest was coming along and myself and another guest told her to watch herself because it was slippery (no visible signage) i just shook my head. Its common sense. Finally a manager told him to not do that right now. Smh."}
{"text":"So I checked in a the wrong one, I visited the one at Town Square.  When we got there at 5:30ish on a Monday night is was empty, only 2 tables besides ours.  There was only ONE server for the entire place.  She was nice and came over pretty quick and took our drink orders.  She also explained the specials but we were there for a drink and dessert.  She took our order the fondue and it came pretty quick.  It started going down hill from there.  The manager seemed nice but lacks leadership and team building abilities.  I have never seen so many people walk around and do NOTHING to help each other out.  Oh there is ONE thing everybody does and when it comes to celebrating your birthday, everyone from the manager on down participates and then they go back to ignoring the customers.  A few more tables came in and our server had to attend to them.  She spent a good solid 5 minutes with one and during that time NO ONE including the manager came over and asked if we needed anything or checked our drinks nothing.  Two employees walked past our table and clearly saw our drinks were empty and we were just sitting there and never said a word.  When our server was finished with the new table I grabbed her as she passed us without looking at us and asked for a black regular coffee.  It took almost 15 minutes to get that coffee, REALLY??  Then the Bartendar disappeared and our server became the Bartendar and we were left alone.  Then I watched the manager go behind the bar and spend a good 5 minutes just chatting with our server instead of helping her with her tables.  We finally got our bill and left.  Team work does not exist in this place and it starts from the manager on down but if you have a birthday to celebrate, the manager will be very quick to grab the computer that controls the music and will blast the birthday song and be focused enough to watch to see when the singing is done so she can turn the song off and turn the volume down, the she goes back to just walking around and not paying attention to tables.  It's sad because they all have great potential, someone just needs to train everyone to be a team instead of individuals.    Needless to say we will not be back as the value for what you got along with the lack of service & attention to customers is not a high priority.  Better food, cheaper prices with a teamwork attitude is available in too many other places.  We did not order enough stuff for it to take 2 hours."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would.  The service here was horrible, which is weird because there seemed to be several waitresses, a busboy, definitely a manager of some kind, and some random hipsters that you could have thought were customers, until you got up to get your own menu (see note about bad service above), and then they got up and got it for you.  The service did not get better once I ordered mediocre food, the busboy brought all the food, and some random French fries no one claimed.  When I got my tomato soup and grilled cheese, the bus boy realized the random French fries from before actually were mine, so he just brought back the same fries.  They were cold by this time.  Communicating with them seemed to be difficult, either they did not listen or did not care, one of the two.  Dessert was ok, but certainly not worth enduring bad service and average food."}
{"text":"What a fun place with friendly service. Here, it's all about large and creative food. I'd say the quality is just average, but I really enjoyed the range and imagination that went into the menu.   My husband went with a basic bleu cheeseburger and fries. Dad and I got the Mac & cheeseburger and a BBQ Chicken pizza to share. Again, good portions and creativity. Ok quality.   For dessert - brownie bread Pudding and a chocolate peanut butter shake. The latter wasn't very thick, but had tons of flavor. And the bread pudding is probably croissant bread pudding with chunks of brownie on top (which they forgot and promptly brought out) as well as ice cream.   This was a fun place to visit with family. As anything on the Strip, it was over priced. But very fun!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money.  I wish I had read the reviews before we had lunch here!!  Had a friend in town visiting and we thought we would give this place a try.  Once seated you feel as if you are sitting in a cafeteria.  Uncomfortable chairs and cheap wobbly tables.  I ordered a turkey burger and my friend decided on the spaghetti and meatballs.  Our waitress came back to our table about 5 minutes later to let me know that they were out of turkey burgers.  I told her that I would have the club sandwich then.  She proceeded to tell me they were out of those as well.  I finally settled on a hamburger.  As we sat and chatted a waiter tried to deliver us another tables food.  When our food did come it was nothing special, you could get the same thing at any fast food joint; and my friends spaghetti looked like it had been poured out of a can.  Atmosphere was poor... As we ate I watched as other patrons were being seated at dirty tables.  The service staff seemed as if they had not ever been trained.  Atmosphere bad, service bad, food TERRIBLE.  $70 dollars later we headed to leave and we were greeted by the manager who said \"come again\".  That definitely won't be happening!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best but my biggest complaint was the service of food to our large group of 30 for a bday party.  Every table of 6-8 was supposed to be given a dish from a pre-fixed menu. Nine out of ten times, the servers skipped our table. It was TERRIBLE. At first, I thought it was just a simple oversight and I complained once...then twice...then three times. Then it just became a joke. It seemed as though they were always one dish short and they were skipping us to ensure that the last table--the table where bday was sitting--was guaranteed a dish. That's fine. He should most definitely get a dish. But if I paid just as much as the group joined next to us (another table of 6-8), we should get the dish too. We paid for it.   At one point, the waiter gave me attitude as  he stuck a dish in front of me and said, \"There. Right in front of your face so you can see it now.\""}
{"text":"It's exactly as it's described. Not something that I myself would get more than once or twice a year. Postmates brought it our way and Sugar Factory made sure everything was in tip top shape when it did. For that one splurge it was perfect. Insane. But perfect."}
{"text":"The service in this place is terrible.    We weren't expecting much, but drinks and napkins would've been nice.    Our waiter was incompetent and unable to keep up with simple things.   After the man passing out our food knocked water all over the table, he continued to hand out meals while water was dripping all over the kids.   He didn't really understand that he needed to clean up the mess before handing out the rest of the food.   After the water debacle, we never receivers our drinks back or our napkins even though we REPEATEDLY asked for them....six of us shared the lone Diet Pepsi left on the table.   My friend never received her food.    The manager was completely useless....they didn't understand that we didn't want our meal comped....we wanted our meal.  This is a terrible tourist stop where they don't care about customer service at all.   Avoid."}
{"text":"This place is just plain CUTE!  There are bright rubber duckies in all colors and sizes throughout the place.  But when you look up, you see sexy chandeliers and mirrors.   The menu is just adorable! There are fishbowl sized cocktails with lollipops, rainbow burgers, and milk shakes covered in chocolate, topped with candied bacon and a slider!   Everything looked good but I finally decided on a fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp, an apple pie crepe with coconut ice cream, and bottomless mimosas. The food was buttery, heavenly deliciousness and washed down well with the mimosas.   Our server, Mark, was really cool and even got us to-go cups for our last mimosa.  I love Vegas!!"}
{"text":"In theory, it's great. The shakes look fantastic and creative. They are disorganized and unprepared. We wanted to have the special ice cream with cotton candy that we read about online, but that was a special so they didn't have it. That's not so bad. Since it was over 100°, we walked really far and 11 o'clock at night, we decided ice cream would be refreshing. We sat down at a booth and were served ice waters by a very nice waiter. There was no ice cream on the menu, only specialty shakes and $50 troughs of ice cream. The waiter told us to wait in line where they served the custard, sorbet and ice cream scoops and then take it back to the table. This was confusing because we were taking up his table and paying at a different place. No one told us where the line was so we waited for a really long time without anyone helping us."}
{"text":"Soooo glad they reopened this sweet place!!! I loved the one at the Paris Casino so when they closed that I was really bummed.  This location now has added the Chocolate Lounge upstairs to the Sugar Factory. So this trip we decided to check  that out.  We had a wonderful view as we ordered two sweet drinks, my daughter had the Bubble Gum cocktail and I had a Raspberry Martini--even though not on their menu they will make any cocktail for you.   The dark chocolate fondue for 2 was delicious! It came with small bites of brownies, lemon cake, angel cake, marshmallows, bananas, gummy bears & strawberries.  The wait staff are beautiful & sweet too!! Although pricey ($70 including gratuity) it really is a cute place to have a dessert, specialty drinks. They also have a candy store & full food menu. It totally reminds me of a new age version of Farrell's. I am def a fan!"}
{"text":"I usually am a 5 star giver so it pains me to do this.   Had a weird experience there with getting my Eggs Benedict order correctly but once it was fixed......It was really really good.  Plus the scalloped potatoes were fabulous. Bottomless mimosas & Bloody Mary's were a hit too ! $20 & its on ! That's awesome ! Banana Split Crepe was really nice. After our order complications were ironed out, they were so apologetic I felt bad, but they made it right.  Very nice people, astute management & great food ! Oh & the decor is superb !"}
{"text":"So pleased to see a Sugar Factory off the Strip. Our meal here was wonderful! We came for Sunday brunch. Fantastic service from start to finish, even when there was a slight delay with my waffles. We had the bottomless mimosas for $20. Tons of flavors - my fave was the wild berry, but my husband and mom preferred the wild orange ones. My waffles were delicious! My mom never finishes her meal, and she killed her egg breakfast. My husband raved about the smoked salmon Eggs Benedict. But really, the best part of our meal was our server Matt. He was fantastic! Super friendly, gave suggestions and was very attentive. He was so fun! Thanks for a wonderful welcome meal for my mom, Matt! She also loved the maître'd that sat us because she is from the Bronx! I highly recommend this location for a great brunch."}
{"text":"Absolute worst service I have ever had.. management was unapologetic about our service.. we waited 40 min for a server .. then an additional 30 for the rest of our party to even order a drink.. food was cold.. beyond disappointed will never come back"}
{"text":"Every time I go to town square my son and I and his father usually eat here. After our experience yesterday we won't be eating here again.   We were feeling a little hungry and it was around 330/4 so we decided to grab a late lunch/early dinner. We walked up to the hostess and we were seated promptly as the restaurant was pretty empty. We were greeted right away by our waiter who asked what we'd like to drink. I ordered my son the hot chocolate and his father got a beer. I'm not a big drinker but every time I'm at sugar factory I always get a mojito because they're so good, so I order my usual raspberry mojito. We also ordered a side of the Mac and cheese pops.   About 5 mins after we place our drink order the drinks arrive. My sons hot chocolate looks and tastes great and his dad is happy with his speciality beer. Mine however was another story. Instead of my regular mojito I always get he'd brought me a huge goblet. Why he'd think I'd want one of those when I was there with my 3 year old is beyond me. Common sense dude. He made a display of pouring it and I made the remark, \" Jeez, every other time I've been here it's always normal sized. This drink is huge, I meant a regular mojito. \" he didn't say anything just walked away. When he came back with our Mac and cheese pops we placed out food order, I ordered the club with no mayo or avocado. I got my son the chicken fingers and his dad got the Spagetti and meatballs. After about a 15 min wait our food was at the table. Both of theirs was great, mine however was not correct as it had both the mayo and avocado on it. Wtf?! I sent it back and they brought me another one a few short mins after. It was right this time but I was already annoyed about the upselling on the huge get drunk off your ass drink and that despite me telling them no mayo and avocado they gave it to me anyway. I took a few bites and was done. The one star isn't because their food is bad. It's because of their, not your way, it's our way attitude. The bill came and was like 100 bucks. Big surprise that a 5th of it was because of the huge mojito that I took like 3 sips of. When the waiter came back I asked him what happened to the regular size mojitos and he said they still had them and when I ordered a mojito he just assumed that I wanted the big one. Um bullshit. He also said when he brought it out and I made my remark he realized I meant a normal one but yet he didn't offer to take it back and bring me a normal one so I call bullshit again. It's seriously common sense. Why would I want a drink that big when my 3 year old is with me? I wouldn't even want that drink if I went out with friends because getting sloshed isn't really my thing.  I'm almost 30 not in college anymore dude. Needless to say we won't be back to this location. Maybe the one on the strip. But definately not the one at Town Square."}
{"text":"This was the place we had my brother birthday dinner.  We were told it was lady's night on Thursday at the chocolate Lounge, which was find but didn't realize we could here anything but the music.  We had 15 people with us so most conversation was through text lol.  Very cute place.    Reason for getting a one star was the service.  Knowing the music was so loud why would you try to talk to me from across the table.  After ordering our food it had taken a good 35-40 for appetizers.  It wasn't busy.  Even for a house salad!  Come on now.  Everyone food didn't come out at the same time.  3 hours later and 20 minutes for the bill.  I was over it not worth $761.  We all wanted desserts but didn't want to wait another hour.    Making the reservations was hard enough to get through.  With one person telling me I had to go through a group with a set menu.  And another telling me we didn't.  Where is the communication?  For being on the Las Vegas strip you would think service would be on point."}
{"text":"It is a tad bit overpriced and I feel the menu is highly limited. If having sugar in all the wrong types of food is your thing you might like this place, not mine."}
{"text":"This review is more on management than food or anything regarding the chain. Although I can imagine this establishment is not the only one doing this.  Sometime during the summer I wanted to get my mother a candied Apple because I know how much she loves them and she doesn't travel to the strip or other stores where they are very common very often so I figured I'd surprise her.  I got home and cut it up for us to share and it was completely rotten. Okay no big deal, I'll just call and return them tomorrow.   I called, spoke to a manager who had a sincere apology and even asked if I'd like a comped meal for 2 and I said sure since the place was so far away from my house anyways.   So I show up later that day dressed up and with my girlfriend only to ask for the manager and be completely ignored regarding the dinner.  I say \"I'm the one that spoke with you earlier about the apple\" to which he replies \"I know, I remember\" then I ask about the comped meals and he completely ignores me and leads me inside and tells me to get 2 more apples along with my refund.  2 comped meals is a lot for this kinda thing, but don't offer it and take it away. I invited my girlfriend and drove all the way out there for no reason."}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly staff and is a nice clean environment. Oh and the waiters cute. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The manager went above and beyond to make up for the experience I had. I went back on a Saturday in the daytime this time. I went on a Sunday last time. It was a totally way better atmosphere. The waiter, Richard, was awesome. He filled our drinks and gave prices on the drinks when we first got there. The burgers were moist and cooked deliciously this time, the fries were fresh, And the desserts tasted great. The caramel sugar daddy is sooo good. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am giving it 1 for staffing reasons... Start off by its a fabulous place. Its fun and a wonderful experience. Most of the staff was awesome! However the management is a piece of work. It was busy took a long time to even get our order placed while sitting AT THE BAR. At the end of our drinks I take off to the restroom. Come back and see a receipt infront of me on bar. My husband then goes to the bathroom. Yes its my fault I assumed he paid! He comes out bar tender says bye and we go to candy store. My husband assumed I paid. Total misunderstanding! Yes it was my fault! But I was in store almost hour wondering picking stuff out. Then go to leave and am scolded and embarrassed infront of others on the strip for not paying... Excuse me!!! It was an accident and I promptly turned and paid. There was no need to let me walk around for an hour and then yell at me! I am beyond pissed and believe they overcharged us on purpose after so. We will NEVER be returning and I wish I could have returned the items I bought."}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away by how bad this place was. The service was mediocre, the food was what I would expect from a cheap bar whose regular chef was sick and the bus boy was doing his best to cook something similar, and the \"bottomless mimosas\" were 90% orange juice that was lower quality than Sunny Delight.  I can see why this place was half empty on a Sunday for brunch in one of the business parts of the strip.  1 star is being generous."}
{"text":"This location is easy to get to. We enjoyed my daughters bday lunch and it was great. Service by Kathy was prompt and on point. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Liked it! Fun atmosphere. Good for the sugar addicts! But they also have a way of making the savory entrees taste like sweets too! Of course there is a wide selection of everything from breakfast until 4pm, crepes savory and sweet, and items like monster burgers, chicken and waffles and French style soups and steaks and frites. My husband and I split the philly burger, it was great and served with fries! We also had two chocolate martinis. I had the smores and he had the mudslide. We were satisfied with this establishment, the food and drinks  and noticed there are Groupons available for this place too!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The server is doing the bartenders work and not paying attention to her tables. Told her we wanted to order and she then gave us attitude. Will not be returning to this location at all. We are both servers and understand what it's like however they were not busy whatsoever so there is no need to make your tables wait that long. We were celebrating a birthday as well and having to wait long when we are hungry just wasn't a good experience. We are still waiting for our food so hopefully the cooks will wow us since our server didn't."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Amazing food and drinks! Great service! I got the Rainbow Sliders which were super delicious and the truffle fries. Also got the Ocean Blue goblet. I really hope they open the restaurant in LA."}
{"text":"After all the hype of one of these opening near me in Foxwoods I attended this one while visiting Vegas last month. My server Chaz was extremely rude, he did not want to be there. My drink was completely watered down and my Mack and cheese bites were over cooked so they were practically empty inside. I have reservations for the Foxwoods location for a company outing and am currently asking them to relocate.  This is a very expensive place to go, and supposed to be a fun atmosphere but just failed on so many level. They will lose at least 4500$ on our company outing due to this experience."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard the expression 'like a kid in a candy store?'  Um, yeah....  I have always wanted to go to a Sugar Factory and there is NONE anywhere near where I live. This was on my Vegas bucket list from the moment I knew I was going!  Now, there are 2 locations in Vegas. This is the one outside of the Fashion Show mall. Our experience here couldn't have been better. We sat at the bar and our bartender was friendly and funny.   We ordered the Giggles Snickers Shake and I sat in excited anticipation while I waited!  When it was ready, OMG!  I could hardly contain my excitement!  It was so beautiful and huge and I couldn't wait to dive in!  My husband ate the snickers on top while I munched the warm waffles. The shake itself was the best we'd ever had!  And, because I wasn't going to let any of this go to waste, we scraped the chocolate off the side with our spoons!    The whole experience from beginning to end was everything I'd hoped!  When we were done I filled up a box of gummies to take home to my daughter. From penguins to whales to crab claws to strippers, they had every gummy you could ever want!"}
{"text":"Sugar factory is expensive all around. Food to drinks to dessert. It's a nice splurge once in a while to treat yourself to massive amounts of sweets and chocolate. However, after coming to this location at the fashion show I don't think I will be coming back.   My friend and I came here and was seated at the chocolate lounge on the second floor. The server girl we had seriously did not know what she was doing neither did the whole staff of the restaurant. I asked if they had happy hour because we got there at 4pm. And the server didn't even know if the restaurant had happy hour. Instead she comes back with a flyer saying \"no but we have ladies night if you want to come back later.\" Umm..no. So then we place our order and as we place our order she fumbles around with her iPad trying to place the order. So food comes. Food was pretty good. Hence the second star.   We ordered the white chocolate burger, onion rings and chicken tenders with the chocolate cookie overload milkshake and the strawberry milkshake. The burger was pretty good. It had some white chocolate drizzle and shavings to the top bun. A mix of swet and salty as you bite into the burger. My friend really enjoyed the chicken tenders. She said the breading was really good compared to others. Onion rings were great as well. The breading was light and came with a chipotle ranch dipping which was pretty good.   Food experience was great. However when paying the bill came around, the server stood behind me while I added the tip to the iPad checkout. I do not like that. My tipping is private and the server should not be standing behind me watching. Tip is based off of the service you provide me. I left an unfortunate 18% which is actually really generous for the crap service I got.  Anyways on the way out my friend and I asked for a bag to put our leftovers in. And one of the guy goes and checks to see if they had any. He comes back and say \"Oh we don't have any upstairs but if you go downstairs they have ALOT\". Ok so you can't go downstairs and grab a bag for a customer? And instead make them go downstairs themselves? Ridiculous!! So ticked off i left without a bag.   The staff is so incompetent. I don't care if you're new or what not. Know the proper ways to provide customer service, and know what your restaurant is offering or don't even work in the industry at all. Keep in mind 4pm on a Thursday. Not busy at all. Probably only 2-3other tables besides mine.   All the other reviews regarding service is true. Incompetent staff and worst service ever."}
{"text":"My first time eating at this restaurant. Location was as expected busy, it was clean, updated and modern. We made a reservation so wait time was not an issue. The noise level of the restaurant was quite distracting and made it difficult to converse with people in our party. The wait staff was amazing, friendly and prompt. My daughter's ordered the specialty drinks  and  we all ordered gourmet burgers.  The drinks were fair and the burgers were sooo good.  The burgers were truly delicious.  This restaurant definitely warrants a return visit."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Will be last time I Come here. Food took forever to be served.Steak was warm, potatoes cold. Just about done with dinner when my napkin fell on floor...went to reach for it and saw a roach crawling on it. Beyond disgusted. Have never encountered that in any restaurant before. Needless to say not coming back."}
{"text":"Would not separate the check took us 30 minutes to pay the check. The guy kept walking away.. So disrespectful. I paid 39$ for one drink"}
{"text":"My nearest and dearest know I'm always hunting cool & colorful places.   When they come across something visually appealing they haven't seen on my social media feeds, they'll tag me. Sometimes demand to know why I haven't been... appalled even.   That is how I came across this place a friend tagged me when she found out I was going to Vegas, then I started to google it and found out they were having a grand opening, a few weeks before we were scheduled to arrive.    Immediately made reservations for our first night there. Online reservation was easy, I didn't even have to print out anything we were on the list.  Day of: We were not going to make it timely, I tried calling to make them aware but was told to get there ASAP.  She didn't have time to go let their hostess know.  We were fashionably late. They were packed, large crowd in and out doors.  I gave my name and the look upon the hostess face. Priceless.   \"We mark you as a \"no show\" after ten minutes\"  *insert annoyed emoji*    Good news, I wasn't turned away, but we lost our table indoors. I was told THE Backstreet Boys were to make an appearance. They did, I have pictures and video, shaking hands and hugging. (worth the extra wait)  We waited about 30 minutes to be seated, which is not bad considering the crowd. It didn't feel long due to the hustle and bustle of standing directly in front of the celebrity dudes. *no longer boys*   They were going to seat us outside in front of the crowd, my girl friend was not having it. N.O. *they bicker* The hostess looks over at me and I say \"look, I know we were late, I am sorry, but I booked it because I saw the beautiful décor and the fancy drinks, we are not here because of the backstreet fellas.\" *insert pouty face*  She said \"I only have outdoor tables, let me take you upstairs\", we walk out of the restaurant, around the crowds, up the stairs, & up to security.....  My eyes and smile couldn't get any bigger. Started wiggling in my skirt doing my happy dance, \"Yes! This is what I want, no better place! Is this where we are sitting?\" *dancing, clapping, silly ear to ear grin*  The most beautiful \"willy wonka\" (not willy wonka but you get it) area I have seen in real life. It's so pretty!!! We sat in a gorgeous gazebo & the lighting was perfect. Yes, I am outdoorsy, like getting drunk on patios too! I was asked a million times by my friends are you okay? I had gone over my limit but I was in magic land.   We sat just on the other side of the Backstreet Boys, window between us, their waitress was our waitress.   She was slow, but because she was busy, and she made it up to us.  Service, although slow, was great! She was a sweetheart. Appetizers, Steak, & Goblets on point. If you have anything here it has to be a Goblet. Just for fun!"}
{"text":"Meh...just ok. The atmosphere is is super cool! The food was ok and the service was awful!!! Like really bad! We had to ask for EVERYTHING...refills, ketchup, the check...the guy never even checked in to make sure that our food tasted good! I don't think it's worth the high price tag."}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food just gets worse every time we come here. We used to come for the chicken fingers since they were breaded perfectly, but they changed them. Now they're hardly real chicken, and tasted like rubber. Even our server was joking with us that they are far from what they used to be. Sorry, won't be back."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. We had a Groupon for $12 for $24. I've heard about the drinks here and was skeptical but they did not disappoint. John and Scott were GREAT help. John was very attentive to our needs and helped us decide on the Mai Tai goblet!! Yummy!! Definitely will dine here again."}
{"text":"Although the dessert (Banana Split Sundae) was delicious, the service was unsatisfactory. Tip was included for parties of 6 or more which helps us understand why we only saw the waitress twice during our time. Maybe they were understaffed but we did not feel well taken care of."}
{"text":"Came in sat and waited for the server. He took forever , took our drink order , and came back took the food order ! There is to much orders here , I prefer to have taken the order one time ! Overall , everything was great . Thank you for the service ."}
{"text":"The one in Planet Hollywood lets you keep your cup since you're already paying about $50 for it. This one you have to pay an extra $15 on top of that to keep it the cup you've already payed for which is ridiculous. Set up is nice. But they really ran out with that extra $15. So if you want the nice sugar Factory cup souvenir, go to the one INSIDE PLANET HOLLYWOOD. Get more bang for your buck"}
{"text":"Warning everything is expensive. But everything is over the top. Goblets 60 ounces with dry ice loved it. There is a candy shop with all sorts of gummies and gelato. Drinks were wonderful avaign just expensive. Cute cute place.  The brownie sundae was only ok brownies were hard. Will be back. Park (free) in red zone of parking garage go up escalators and turn around - go out door to strip."}
{"text":"Crazy bougie expensive for what you get, but the mac n cheese balls are life changing. Wish it was less of a touristy spot. Would be really good if the prices were more fair."}
{"text":"If you want something sweet and fun and unique come here. Sugar overload that's for sure. Food was good, lots of sweet options. We went on Easter. Didn't even have to wait, we were seated as soon as we walked in.   The server seemed a little overwhelmed with tables. We had ordered a second coffee and it never came. The mimosa tasted more like oj (where's the champagne?) We ordered the French toast with berries and the lemon blueberry pancakes with a side of bacon. Also they don't just have coffee, they have espresso coffees only."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to visiting the Sugar Factory during my trip to Vegas. I went on a Tuesday around 1 PM and it wasn't packed at all. I sat at the bar and the server wasn't very attentive at all. She seemed very preoccupied and flustered but there was literally only a handful of people in the restaurant.   As for the food, I ordered the burger that had Mac and cheese on it. I substituted the beef patty for turkey. Overall, the burger was bland and the macaroni was average at best. The fries were delicious though!  I also ordered two shots and a goblet (what was I thinking?!) The goblet was very fruity and I only drank half and it got the job done. My bill came to $70 I believe but I had a groupon deal which knocked it down to $40. Pretty expensive but typical for Vegas.  I would definitely return, try something else on the menu, and probably sit at a table instead of the bar."}
{"text":"Love the concept but the food is just ok. Very popular location being that its on the Las Vegas strip so be prepared for crowds. I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. For how pricey it is I would have expected a better meal. The ambiance is loud music and low lights so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"While visiting my day daughter, son-in-law & grandson a few weeks ago l had the opportunity to buy a Groupon for the Sugar Factory! The pictures of the deserts had fantastic presentation value. We all went there for a late lunch. The restaurant is beautiful on the inside with chandeliers on the ceiling. The ice cream shop is to the left when you enter. My daughter and I tried numerous samples of the many fun flavors there while we were waiting on our meal. We ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza and a Mac and Cheeseburger and Blue Cheeseburger with Fries. Overall the food quality of the burgers and fries was average in taste. I expected more from the Mac and Cheeseburger. The Mac and cheese while overflowing onto the plate looked and tasted like it came from a box. The BBQ Chicken pizza was my favorite food item. It had a nice tangy BBQ sauce and a delicious presentation. For desert we ordered the Brownie Bread pudding and the Chocolate Peanut Butter shake. The bread pudding came without brownies but this was quickly fixed by our server who provided friendly and attentive service the entire meal. The shake looked awesome with peanut  butter cups on top. It was thick and had the added tastes of marshmallow. The Sugar Factory is a little pricey but it is a great experience just to go there. Someday I want to return to try other menu items and the ice cream parlor.#yelpvg"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! We were celebrating a birthday on an early evening, a slow night we waited over 45 minutes for our cocktails and they weren't the ones we ordered. Our server said she would take care of our drinks and she didn't. We had a coupon and our server never added it to our check... management could have stepped in to make the situation better"}
{"text":"We decided to try a new place out last night. As a local to Vegas, I don't head down to the strip often. The Sugar Factory may have just changed that. Having never been to the restaurant,  we asked our server Emon what he suggested. After a great conversation we ended up ordering signature burgers. The food and the atmosphere were great. But what really made the experience awesome was the service we got. If you go, make sure to ask for Emon!!"}
{"text":"Service was better yesterday then it has been the last few times I've visited. I absolutely love their chicken fingers and club sandwich. Easy and simple lunch!"}
{"text":"Food was okay Ill admit Ive had a better burger at red robin. We specifically asked the girl if we got fifty percent off pf our sons thirty five dollar drink. We were told everything was fifty percent off and we brought it to her attention at check out and she had an attitude when I told her we were misinformed before we ordered. She said well I can get a manager with an extreme attitude. We declined and decided we wont come back in the future."}
{"text":"Avoid, avoid, avoid!  We came to this place after seeing an ad for a meet and greet with UFC fighters. The ad also said to contact them for reservations. Naturally, we assumed this meant that to get to see the fighters you would need to be a patron, so we booked a reservation and showed up on time. The fighters, however, did not. They showed up an hour late. And when they did arrive, this place became a circus.  There was no organization whatsoever. We asked our waiter if it was possible to meet the fighters (as we were dining in the restaurant for that purpose) and he said \"they don't tell me anything about what's going on\" and walked away. When we got up and tried to get closer, we were told to \"get in line\" if we wanted a picture....so why did we make the reservation (as the ad suggested) and spend $$$ dining there if we're supposed to line up behind nearly 100 people who weren't patrons? Eventually, we did manage to get some pictures since the process was such a mess that they couldn't really stop anyone dining in the restaurant from doing so.   But I feel really bad for the people who waited hours in line, most of whom were waiting in 40+ degree weather, to meet fighters that showed up an hour late + further delays because people that I assume are friends of the restaurant owners or something got to skip the line to meet the fighters.  To make matters worse, the burger I had was not cooked properly. I ordered it medium-well but received it well-done and charred. The fries were great - at least they have that going for them?  While I wanted to order dessert, the experience left such a poor taste in my mouth that I no longer wanted to contribute to these guys and will definitely avoid them in the future."}
{"text":"My kids and I had a blast here! Our waiter Chez was amazing he was very attentive and even had a couple jokes up his sleeve for the kids. I came in with two of my girlfriends and their children and we all agree this is a great place for kids and adults as well :) most of the fishbowl drinks can be made non alcoholic for the kids, awesome music beautiful decor and excellent food. The desserts are to die for and so creative!! We will be back for more soon maybe without the kids next time!!"}
{"text":"Great, go for the happy hour,  half off everything!  The regular burger is great, the mini sliders appetizer are very small, but still good. More flavors for the goblet drinks at Town Square than on the strip. The goblet with red bull is delicious.  Must try."}
{"text":"I think I am going to call this my new favorite off-strip place! I found the food very tasty. I happened to show up during Happy Hour so I was pleased to find that all of my drinks were half off. Mac sure you try the Mac & Cheese App. Its absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Groupon for $25 for $40 (can be used toward food, beverages and Retail).  We purchased: * hot wings which were excellent. Perfectly seasoned a little hotter than I usually get. * mixed green salad with a side of Sesame ginger dressing * Tomato Basil Bisque served with 4 pieces of grilled bread topped with melted cheese.  This came up to $34. We split each dish and it fulfilled two of us and we had to ask for a to-go box.  So I still had $6 to use but they did not have my favorite candy which is chocolate-covered gummy bears so it it up getting a bag of pre-made cotton candy.  TIP: As a bonus this location gave us complimentary cotton candy exclamation and they were big puffs of cotton candy."}
{"text":"Used a Groupon. Enjoyed everything about this place. Everything was good. Get the bacon cheeseburger sundae with French fries!"}
{"text":"Ariel was awesome! The rainbow sliders were so good! Seat quick and the food came quick."}
{"text":"Very nice lovely atmosphere and awesome drinks! Service of the wait staff definitely needs more training and attention. I had 3 situations that I had to speak to the manager about. He was very nice and personable. I'll try Sugar Factory again and hope for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Went with friends to celebrate a birthday. Drinks were great especially since they were 1/2 off all night!! Appetizers were yummy, entrees left a lot to be desired. My eggplant Parmesan came with one slice of eggplant and a lot of pasta and sauce that could of have come straight from a jar. My friends burger was just luke warm and the fries were limp. So just blah. We ordered a banana split to share since it was my friends birthday and we happy with that til we saw the same banana split come out to the next table with a firework in it. The server knew it was my friends birthday, so I would have thought a little extra effort would have been made, plus she spilled ice tea on my friend and then has the balls to say to that same friend \"oh, I forgot to charge you for your drink, let me fix that.\" Really? I would have thought the tea would have been free after you spilled it on her!!! It's a great place for drinks and desserts but the in between leaves a lot to be desired, especially for the prices they are charging for the entrees and the service was just ok."}
{"text":"Menu is themed to sugar with over the top fun goblet drinks and cocktails. Our group ordered a bottle of champagne celebrating an event and while the server was opening the bottle I noticed the flutes has some serious hard water stains all over them that kept me from finishing my drink after the initial sip (a water softener would be an easy investment). Food was good and came out in a timely manner. We shared an ice cream dessert that was covered with whipped topping and tons of sprinkles.  Biggest turn off was that it's not a clean restaurant. The floor on the second floor was so sticky when I walked in for lunch. I mean disgustingly sticky as in it apparently hadn't been mopped in a very long time. I was thankful to only have to walk through to the elevator that took me to the dining room downstairs. Downstairs was much better as far as being clean.   Best part of the whole lunch was the entire genuinely super friendly staff that made our experience fun."}
{"text":"Sugar Factory has been on my Vegas to-do list for years! I never had the chance to visit when it was located at the Paris hotel, so I was delighted to find out there were still locations open at the Fashion Show mall.  Long story short, Sugar Factory is just a better branded Cheesecake Factory that is much more expensive. Their goblet drinks and extravagant desserts are what pull customers in and are really the only things worth trying in my opinion. The Sugar Factory Chopped Salad was not chopped, pretty mediocre and I had to request a different type of dressing to really jazz up the sad greens. The Mango goblet drink was okay.. nothing too special so next time I'll stick to a sugary frozen drink from the strip.  I went during a pretty busy time and our waitress seemed overwhelmed by all the tables, so I felt bad with all my numerous requests for water, etc.  Vegas is pricey so double check if you really want to spend your money here."}
{"text":"Drinks and shakes are fun and good. Food is so bad I don't even have a description for it.  We've been many times and every time I don't even finish my food it's so terrible. Why is it so hard to figure out how to make the food decent?"}
{"text":"I picked up some cool lollipops here for my daughter.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the candy.  I almost bought my wife some edible candy panties and bra, but I'm on a diet and not sure if she would think its funny.    Well I'm still at the MGM so maybe I will get those ;-)"}
{"text":"Glad to say I came but I most likely won't be returning.   The Sugar Factory isn't your average candy shop. They are commonly known for being widely endorsed by celebrities and the ginormous 60oz signature Goblets. With it being so widely popular, there are multiple Sugar Factory locations worldwide ranging from Las Vegas, NYC, Chicago, Orlando, Dubai, and even Manila.   After numerous trips to Las Vegas and my IG constantly being riddled by drool worthy images of SF, I was pretty bummed at the fact that I have never gotten the chance to experience it first hand. This most recent visit changed all of that......  Our party arrived and was told there would be a wait for a table but if we didn't mind sitting at the bar, we could be seated right away. No harm no foul since our only reason for stopping by was for the infamous goblets.  Be advised that the once glass goblets are now plastic and being the picky person that i am, scratched up plastic fishbowls were not appealing whatsoever.   Instead we opted for 3 martinis: LEMON HEAD- described as \"lemon with a hint of sweetness\" WATERMELON BURST- \"crisp taste of watermelon\" SOUR APPLE LOLLY- \"liquefied sour apple lollipop\"  Overall experience- the cost is waaay too expensive for something that simply tasted soooo sooooooo bad and the portions are definitely skimpy. One added star for the nice gentleman who helped us out and insisted on my little sister looking like his cousin. LMAO."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing and mind blown the food here is incredible and the drinks alcohol and shakes are eye candy for the eye and the sweet tooth! Brought my sister from Connecticut to see Las Vegas ! She was pleasantly surprised to have the chicken and waffles with me it was big enough for the both of us to share! My husband had the Bloody Mary and banana French toast!  I will be visiting the candy bar to see if there is a gift for my girls! Thank you so much for an absolutely amazing time! We loved it so much we bought the table behind us drinks for their three daughters the same one in the pictures!) they were so happy"}
{"text":"I went here with a few girlfriends who were visiting for the weekend. The food was awesome - had the tuna melt. They were out of all their wine and turkey. Our server's name was Alex. To be honest, he was horrible. We were sitting at one his two tables and he was a space cadet. Forgot our drinks multiple times, got my order completely wrong (didn't feel like dealing with him at this point) didn't bring set ups, napkins, etc., and scoffed at me when I asked for the salt and pepper. He needs to learn some serious customer service. But all and all a good dinner."}
{"text":"This place was the highlight of my trip . Every single candy theme item I can't wait to try. The drinks can have a show of its own. I can't wait to go a second and third and fourth.  If you have a sweet tooth and a taste for good food this is the place for you. A must stop"}
{"text":"I have to give a big shout out to Corey D. for giving us such a great time with good food. The customer service was also excellent. We will be back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"Great! Our server was Adrian E we got the energy bear goblet"}
{"text":"Didn't want to come here in the first place and their food justified why... While nothing was wrong with the service, the food is sub par... cheap ingredients and overpriced for what you're getting. Pass."}
{"text":"Our waiter, Justin, was fantastic!  The whole crew was great and we'll try to be back before we leave."}
{"text":"Expected the worst, but had to \"experience\" the drinks the wifey had checked out online.  Arrived on a Tuesday around 11am. Place reminded me of an old soda fountain bar but with adult beverages disguised as childhood dream thirst quenchers, and a candy emporium as we came in.  Wife chose a Strawberry Mojito to share. Waiter was attentive and gave her the heads up to grab a video of the pour of our watermelon mojito into the icy red glass.  Once the liquid he poured hit the dry ice, the vaporous concoction started to bubble and boil.  Pretty tasty as well with a good mix of rum, fruit, mint and enough little fruit gummys to put a four year old into a sugar coma.  Food arrived and wifeys fish tacos were crispy and delicious.  My steak was petite, but well marbled, very well seasoned, and cooked perfectly with my over easy eggs and crispy home style potatoes.  Toast was meh, but satisfactory to mop up the eggs.  Price was the usual stack of cash for two.  Enjoyed it all and would recommend!"}
{"text":"ASK FIRST!!!! I thought I knew the price going in. I thought you got to keep the glass..... a non- alcoholic version of their signature nitrogen drink was $36 on a Wednesday night.  Be prepared."}
{"text":"Update: I decided to give this place another try and from what I see, they have improved extremely since their first opening week. Jennevive, Sean, and my waitress were very pleasant and made sure my boyfriend and I were well taken care of. I absolutely enjoy their menu. It's full of yummy and interesting sweet beverages (you have to try one of the Goblets). The ambiance is lovely, classy yet hip and the environment live and fun. I'll definitely be back with some friends and family!!!   Not a good experience. I sat at the bar and was served by an Asian guy, I believe his name tag said \"ST\"... unfortunately he wasn't as enthusiastic with me as he was with other patrons. I sat at the bar and was ignored for about 15 mins, even the patrons sitting next to me were inquiring and wondering what was the deal. So I finally spoke up and asked if I could order. I ordered my drink but I wasn't given water like the other customers. He poured the drink and walked away and never gave me a straw. I had to ask another bartender, who I also had to make my food order with. She was great (sucks I can't remember her name). The drink was delicious and though my food order took forever and a day, I was comped for my second drink. All in all, I probably won't return. I'm unsure why I didn't receive the keen service as others but it was very disappointing to experience such at a reputable restaurant."}
{"text":"Sunday Afternoon was my Birthday Brunch at Sugar Factory. We had no clue there was even a Sugar Factory in Las Vegas so we were excited to experience how the Vegas one was because we love the NYC One. Upon late arrival (we had to walk through a hotel lobby to reach the entrance), we told the Hostess that we called a few minutes that we were going to be running late and that we also had a reservation. She told us it would be a 20 minute wait & we can sit at the bar outside. Unfortunately,  it started to rain outside so we had to wait by the wall (the inside bar was full) during our wait. After about 15 Minutes, we were seated & given menus. We couldn't but notice the manager looked familiar to us. We later asked her if she was from the Meatpacking location & she confirmed she was the General Manager that followed with a warm conversation between us 3, she was very nice. We ordered our Steak & Eggs with Bottomless Mimosas which were all delicious, service amazing & can't beat the music and ambiance of the place. They also did a very good job with surprising me with Dessert for my Birthday! If you've never been to Sugar Factory, what are ya waiting for?"}
{"text":"For the TS (Town Square) Location:  Came in with a party of 5 and was seated right away. It was extremely busy for a Monday night so you know the place is desirable. Inside looks amazing, has a nice  white bar and table tops with gorgeous chandeliers down the back wall. We got an Almond Joy martini,a S'mores martini, Blue Ocean Goblet and a Passion Punch Goblet as well as a classic Margarita. SO GOOD!! all this drinks were very tasty (their specialty)   For apps we got the baked brie, popcorn shrimp and a bruschetta and two of the girls got french onion soup to start; all of which were amazing! Usually bruschetta  and french onion soups are hit or miss, well Sugar Factory's TS were definitely A HIT.  Next came a Tuna Melt, Tuna Tuscan Salad,Bleu Cheese Bacon Burgers and the best grilled cheese sandwich ever, had 4 different cheeses in it!   Plus they have candy, lollipops and merchandise you can purchase before you leave!  The food was great and the service was well above anything else I've experienced at Yard House or Brio. Would definitely recommend to any local or tourist in Town Square for the day, GO TO SUGAR FACTORY TOWN SQUARE, so good!!! A+"}
{"text":"Honestly only went because my girlfriend saw the different colored sliders on Instagram.   But damn! For just being sliders, they're really good!   Only downside is location. Unless you're staying on that end of the strip, it can be a bit of a walk to get there."}
{"text":"I really love the Sweet Factory!  They have the yummiest original cocktails sure to satisfy your sweet tooth.  Me and my friend went here for Happy Hour and they have super killer deals.  We had the BBQ Chicken pizza and it was deelish!  Our serer was super sweet (no pun intended) and helpful with helping us choose drinks and food."}
{"text":"I've given this place three chances now and each time it got worse.  This last time I was left just completely disgusted with this place.   A group of 11 of us came here for brunch.  It took 20 minutes to get just water on the table, then the server, Gina, took our orders but informed us that they were out of bloody maries which sucked because that was part of the whole reason we went there to begin with.  4 people opted to get the bottomless mimosas.  They got their first glass and then she never came back to offer them refills.  We waiting over an hour and food never came.  When we asked to talk to a manager, we were informed that they ran out of champagne so the manager was out picking up more.  At this point, we were ready to just walk out but we felt sorry for the server and despite their complete disorganization and lack of customer service, we decided to be nice and stay.  The food FINALLY came out and most everyone was sorely disappointed.  The only thing that seemed good were the waffles.  I ordered the fried egg sandwich and the eggs were so overcooked it was like 2 pieces of rubber.  The \"Canadian bacon\" was just a paper thin piece of ham on top of a flat squishy English muffin.  Then there were fries covered in gravy.  This dish was so disgusting I had one bite and couldn't eat anymore.  They finally informed us that they got more champagne and bloody maries so we started ordering rounds and she kept bringing them out, but she forgot someone's ice tea and refilling my water.  We reminded her and the busser 4 different times for the iced tea and it finally came at the very end of the meal.  A funny thing that happened during brunch. There were quite a few groups with children and one of these groups had what looked like an 11-year-old's birthday.  They ordered the \"birthday special\", which is this giant ice cream dessert that the servers bring out with sparklers and make a big show of it.  Well when this happened, they started playing the \"Go Shawty it's your birthday\" song, which the lyrics are SOOO inappropriate for that particular moment. It was comical.  Overall this place sucks and has absolutely no business being open.  I will NEVER eat here again, and like every business in this location before it, I'm sure we'll see a closed for good sign on its doors soon."}
{"text":"No Split!  Sugar Factory will forever remain one of the cutest places to celebrate special occasions with your best girlfriends and for that I'm grateful they've re-opened. Spending over $500 after tipping on top of gratuity for a \"mediocre\" dining experience is extremely disappointing (definitely not the hip-trendy-exceptional service they're known for)!    PROS: The Chocolate Lounge was extremely patient and sat majority of my squad while the remainder of the crew (8 total) were \"tardy for the party\" on a Saturday evening! (The restaurant was very slow upstairs to be honest)  CONS: We started off with hair in one of the 8 glasses of water. Small service failure but still unacceptable.   The Pacific Salmon $29 was very over cooked; not by request.   The spinach dip $15 was terrible. I wish I could compare it to something but I'd rather not. Just skip it and thank me later!  My friends salad didn't have one drop of dressing which was completely strange. (Of course we \"found\" the waiter to make it right).  I purchased The Drake $40 for obvious reasons! Y-O-L-O  Regrettably, it looked like swamp water? Total opposite of the photo! If Drake didn't change his number so frequent, I'd call him and get his thoughts on the situation! Of course I didn't drink it. The not so souvenir cup became a filthy looking photo opp for my out of town snap chat peeps! It's an additional $15 to keep the plastic \"souvenir\" cup can you believe that?! Total rip!  The icing is the new \"no split\" check policy that our server failed to share until the end. Everyone paying towards one bill with the option to receive separate receipts of payment is so backwards and took the server way more time to settle 8 payments.   Overall I'm uncertain if I'd return which is disheartening because I've been a SF fanatic since couture pops were on trend (that's a long damn time in Kardashian years)!   Totally five star worthy but not worth it this evening!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had such a great time here last weekend! They recently have opened, and have not even had their grand opening yet. The place is so cute and beautifully decorated. Everyone was very friendly and inviting at our 11am arrival. I ordered breakfast and my husband ordered lunch. Also, a killer milkshake! (Over the top maybe but so fun and worth it! I swear we talked about it for weeks) Our food was great, server was great, talked to a manager who was very friendly and informative. Looking forward to returning!!!"}
{"text":"I saw videos of this place and was super excited to try their drinks and see the candy shop. We got two goblet drinks: Lollipop Passion & Fuzzy Peach Penguin Mango. Thankfully, they offer the drinks without alcohol because our waiter said it was about 6 shots in each drink.   The Lollipop Passion was green and was topped with two lollipop sticks and sugar candies. It tasted mostly like coconut, but it also has small hints of melon and pineapple. It wasn't great. The Fuzzy Peach Penguin Melon tasted straight up like orange soda, even though it was supposed to be peachy and mangoy. They had some gummy penguins in the ice and orange slices on the edge of the goblet. It was great and exciting seeing the dry ice working with the drink, but towards the bottom my drink froze and I couldn't drink the last inch of it. As fun and childish the drink was, it was insanely expensive. $34 for each goblet!! We didn't even get alcohol in ours, so I thought maybe it wouldn't be so expensive. I guess you really just pay for the dry ice and show.  This is a fun place to try once. Get ready for a big bill at the end!"}
{"text":"Food was good and drinks were very unique. The cost of the Goblet drinks should include a take home glass too for $38. We are glad it wasn't busy as the restaurant setup is very tight with only inches between the tables. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is my second time visiting the sugar factory, and the last time i went it was near the paris hotel, and this location is at the Fashion Show mall. It's very nice and clean and very romantic like. Only thing i have to say about the sugar factory is they food. I asked for the hamburger with mac and cheese on top with no bun. They brought it but with a little and mac and cheese so i asked the waitress to look at my hamburger and she said \"ill bring you some more mac and cheese for your hamburger\" she did. My sister order a Classic cheese burger, and she asked for well done and she didn't get that, so she had to send the burger back and got a new one. These are the only reasons that i'm not impressed with this location, but they drinks are very good i might say!!!!They don't skip on the alcohol when it comes to the Goblet drinks with the candy in them."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing !!! Marc was our server and he was awesome.  John Sweiss guided us through our experience to perfection.   The rainbow sliders were a crowd pleaser and the mai tai was yummy . Topping it off with one of the most decadent chocolate cakes I have ever had.    Thank you for a great night . Making memories one duck at a time !!"}
{"text":"This place is sugar heaven! They have every gummy, chewy, and chocolate candy you can imagine. One pound of candy costs about $14; my hubby and I got a few of our favorites and a t-shirt for my niece that says \"Will Trade Brother for Candy\" which cost $20. They have a bunch of candy memorabilia around the store, as well as Sugar Factory t-shirts and merchandise. Everyone in the store was very helpful and fun. I had a great shopping experience and recommend stopping by if you're staying at the MGM Grand."}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Extremely slow, mediocre service. Why did we come here? Great Happy Hour prices on Mondays.... that's why... but is it really worth it? Probably not."}
{"text":"I love this, what's not to love. Sugar and alcohol in one big jar (9 shots per glass). Nell was behind the bar. She was hilarious. Drinks were awesome. I had the hot and wild spicy. Yum"}
{"text":"Every Thursday night at the Sugar Factory is ladies night. Ladies receive a free glass of champagne. The top half the glass is covered in melted white chocolate and white chocolate shavings. Who doesn't like chocolate?! It looked heavenly and tasted devilly delicious! Each additional glass was only $5. In addition, they had complimentary appetizers to go along with the evening which included  bruschetta, a white chocolate fountain with brownies, marshmallows, and strawberries to with it. Yummy! Only gave 3 stars because the food was only for a limited amount of time and the server did not charge us correctly."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day lunch. I went because I saw the drinks on Instagram and wanted to try them. The food was subpar to terrible. I ordered eggs Benedict and the yolk was broken and dried by the time It got to me. Also, I had four children and my husband with me. We did not get any silverware with our food and when they finally brought silverware they only brought four sets. I couldn't eat my food until I got some more because I gave the first sets to the children. Then, I had to get up and ask for more silverware even though we asked for extra sets when they brought the first ones. My point is that the food isn't good, the cheese on the burger looked like cheese wiz. And the service is HORRIBLE. But the drinks were fun. If you want to go for drinks with friends this place could be fun if you have zero expectations for customer service. But avoid the food, there are MUCH better places to eat in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast because we had a Groupon. I was really excited about this place and been wanting to try it for some time. The host was sweet and talked us up a bit which was nice. Our server was very attentive and friendly which is why I'm giving this place two stars instead of one. The reason for the low rating was the food. It was cold and bland and terrible. Prices were way too high for that quality. I got a creme brûlée latte for $13 and it was served in a tiny cup and halfway through it it got terribly sweet. I've had creme brûlée lattes before so I am aware of how sweet they get but this was gross. I drank it anyway needing the caffeine. I could've gotten two coffees at starbucks next door and still had change in my pocket. The potatoes were stale and cold and they give you half a scoop. I can't even compare it to the freezer bag of potatoes you would get at the super market because even those taste better. The New York steak and eggs was a joke. The steak didn't even look grilled. There were no grill marks and it looked like someone slapped it on to a cold pan. No good looking sear or anything. On top of that it looked like a cheap diner piece of meat. It was a very thin small over cooked piece of meat. The picture makes it looked like a thick cut beautifully grilled slab. They give you one piece of toast too. For $22 they couldn't even give you a full order. $7 for an order of bacon that wasn't even thick cut but looked like something you would get at a drive thru. I got the Alaskan Benedict. You know when you forgot to zip up a bag of meat in the fridge and the edges become hard and brown? Yeah that's how the edges of my soles salmon looked. I work at a breakfast lunch and dinner spot that sells food half the price but higher quality and properly cooked. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I aren't people to complain and ask for new plates especially since we didn't have time for that so we just paid and left."}
{"text":"NOT the same focus as the Sugar Factory on the strip.  This one is a sit-down restaurant in Town Square that has some retail candy available for purchase.  I would not have tried except for a Living Social offer but I'm glad I did.  Somewhat overpriced for the location and food but the grilled four cheese sandwich with tomato soup was really good.  I like cheese but have to admit the sandwich had too much cheese.  The tomato soup was quite good.  Service was efficient but then it was pretty empty for lunch on a Friday at 11:00."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought of kids to to Vegas to kick of summer vacay! Our kids are teens so they had certain spots they wanted to explore and try! My 13 yr old, Kylie and Drake obsessed wanted to try Sugar LOL so I found a great Groupon, pay $40 for $80 value. We were greeted at the front and choose to sit outside. Here's what we ordered  2 classic burgers- standard  Classic steak- boring, no flavor Nutella pancakes Garlic butter pasta- boring, very little flavor Garden salad Rainbow sliders Mac and cheese balls The dye milk shake Rocky road milkshake Watermelon goblet  Bill with Groupon and checkin on yelp, $180  The food was ok nothing wow..... The goblet, it was ok had a powder taste to it. I barely drank half and you don't even get to keep the goblet! For that much give me the dam cup!  So 2 star for food, if we come again I'd do the mac and cheese balls and desserts only.  Now, the service! Ugh! The waiter didn't really engage with us and tell us about the menu, the menu is huge so it would be great to get some help here! Then after we were done eating, we sat and waited for 30 mins, I just wanted the bill and saw the waiter taking everyone's order but never came over to see if we were okay or to check us out. Finally I went in and requested the bill. Which they finally brought out. I showed him my check in and Groupon. He rolled his eyes and said this is a process and takes a while I have to go upstairs and do it. WTF???? Don't have a check in and Groupon if you all can't figure it out! Another 15 min wait, comes back and gives me my bill to sign. Never once explains there's already gratuity added, but hands me the bill with the option for tip open. So I added the tip because again I had no idea it was there already! Ugh! So he got there mandatory tip they charge and an extra tip! Ugh!!! Then I had to even ask for a paper receipt as he wasn't going to even give me one. Service sucks! Mind you the restaurant was not even packed, not busy at all! Someone needs to train this waiter!"}
{"text":"Took a long time for the food to come I ordered a well done burger it was super pink in the inside my wife order chicken alfredo noodles was over cooked wish I could give it zero star"}
{"text":"We went to Sugar Factory last night for dinner at the Town Square location. It has a nice decor, awesome chandeliers. When it's someone's birthday they play 50 cent \"It's Your Birthday\" instead of the same 'ol Happy Birthday song.   The food and dessert is so good. I wouldn't recommend to get the chicken fingers. They weren't breaded like how you would think.   Service was excellent. They had a separate person topping off your drinks."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a couple times these past 2 months. Once for a friends birthday and the other was for a friend's farewell dinner, which occurred last night. Last night had to be one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had mostly due to poor service.   When I went to order I noticed the sign on the wall advertising fudge Nutella crepes for $13.99 on the menu it states Nutella crepes for $12 +scoop of ice cream from $3 more. I asked my waiter what the difference was between the advertised item on the wall and the one on the menu. He looked at me, dumbfounded, and said \"I don't know what you're talking about...they don't tell me anything around here.\" And after beating the bush for awhile he finally said, \"I can ask if you want I guess\" (which he probably should've done in the first place). Then I asked if they had cookies and cream ice cream and he said \"uhh yeah you can put ice cream on there for $3 or $4 or something like that\" he acted very unprofessional at that point. Our meals came out and I was pretty disappointed with my fudge Nutella crepe. It was not worth $17!!!   We also ordered a pizza (with mushrooms and pepperoni) - that did not really look cooked to order and had a huge hole in one of the slices, basket of French fries and onion rings (creamy chipotle sauce was pretty awesome), a sandwich (not the best honestly), and a banana split crepe (this order was brought out wrong, the waiter brought my friend the banana split dessert meal for 2, not the crepe). The waiter brought my friend out the wrong order and it took a very long time for him to get the correct one out. At this point he probably should've offered her an incentive for having to make her wait and watch us all eat our food.   We ordered the white gummi bear goblet mixed cocktail drink which was pretty delicious, but way too sweet to drink all of it. And I ordered an amber ale. At the end of our dinner, our waiter claimed he accidentally charged us for the table's meal next to us, so he said he needed to void our checks and do it over again. We waited a longer amount of time but the second time he brought us our checks they were all the same prices so it really didn't make any sense to us.   My friend asked the manager for a void receipt and after waiting for a longer period of time once again, we found that we were double charged and one of the orders was never voided... Overall terrible service and food isn't great for what you're paying for. It is overpriced. So if it were my choice, I would not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. So much fun. Great waiters and staff. Food is good too. Highly recommend for a birthday celebration!"}
{"text":"Left in tears. For my 21st birthday I had reserved my reservation two weeks ago. Our table was ignored, the service was slow... Then the hostess told another server I never had a reservation?!? That's funny because SHE CALLED ME TO CONFIRM AND I CALLED TWO WEEKS AGO!!! And as I watched other tables receiving more attention and getting fire works and ice cream sundaes I was completely forgotten. There was only two other tables and mine in the whole establishment! No one came to check on us. The manager gave me a gift bag with a few things and just said sorry... :( so upset."}
{"text":"I HAVE to say \"yay\" to this Sugar Factory. It is located across from AMC theaters on the first floor of Town Square Mall!   (1) It's way way cheaper than the Strip one. (2) It's more accessible and easier to park close to.  (3) Probably one of the most interesting Happy Hours  It is just as comfortable to be seated outside as it is inside. Also, it isn't crowded on the inside and the staff is really nice and sweet!   Note that the food isn't crazy delicious, but they always have amazing presentation. I had the red velvet sundae ice cream. It was just vanilla ice cream with red velvet syrup. And a little bit of red velvet cake pieces. It was really a sad dessert that just needs to be called vanilla ice cream and sold for 7 dollars! A lot of the food is good, but isn't worth what it costs!   There is also a bit of candy in this store, too, and gelato!!   My advice to you: Enjoy those drinks at Happy Hour and have a fun night :)"}
{"text":"My first time in any Sugar Factory and I had a great time. Our server was Menz, and I had no complaints. Our party enjoyed him as our server. Someone I was with ordered chicken fingers and they were a little salty but,hey, it happens (pleas fix it lol) We wish our goblets could have been stronger but the service was good so it trumped that. The atmosphere and music was really good.   I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have had a few drinks from the Sugar Factory, but this was my first time eating here. Love the decor, if your into the Kardashian's you'll love it even more they have pictures and videos that pop up around the room.  The atmosphere is a mix between loungish and restaurant. Great place to get a night on the town started, large and sweeet drinks filled with different candy's. I had the white chocolate and apple bacon burger It was messy to eat but a finger licking good. I need to go back when I can have one of their out of control shakes."}
{"text":"My appetizer was the fried macaroni and cheese pops for $14. The pops were ok and you receive 3 per order. They come with a tomato sauce, which reminds me of grilled cheese sandwiches with tomato soup. For my meal I ordered the South Beach Flair with a side of French fries for $19. The burger and fries were delicious and my burger was cooked perfectly for me (well done). My favorite was the Nutella banana milkshake for $19. Next time I visit I'll have to try their alcoholic beverages. Currently they have a Groupon deal for $80."}
{"text":"Upon walking in, the hostesses greeted us in a very cheerful and friendly manner. Our server was very attentive; she always made sure our drinks were full and that everything was perfect. The food was delicious and it came at a surprisingly fast pace; we were impressed. We ate in the Chocolate Lounge which had gorgeous views and a fancy atmosphere, although we did pass by the downstairs area which was lovely as well. When we were all done, the manager and our server thanked us and wished us a good night, which felt very nice and personal. Overall, we had a wonderful experience. Thank you, Sugar Factory!"}
{"text":"Well it was a one and done place for sure. Bad lighting,  poor service and quality of drinks and high prices. One hamburger, two grilled cheese sandwiches and three drinks each large 2 small for the bargain price of $157. Our waiter was hard to find. By the time we were trying to get out of there to hit a Vegas show I was done with it all. I had to go to the hostess and ask her to find my server so that we could check out. The crew screams happy birthday to almost every table occupied, apparently it was everyone's birthday, with Roman candles shooting out the top of a deserts and noise levels of an airport runway conversation at our own table was rough at best. The drinks were billed as 63 ounces. With ice and dry ice to cause a bubbling effect we may of had a 12 oz drink watered down? Maybe they boiled off the alcohol? I'm just saying enough sugar to give a toothache, but nut enough kick to pack the tiniest buzz . I loved Farrell's ice cream parlors as a kid but this seems like a bit of a swing and a miss. In a town with lots of options keep looking."}
{"text":"One of the worst service experiences I have had yet. The only saving grace to this place was the ambiance that my children enjoyed and the table next to us that interacted with us. Our server never introduced himself. It was like we were interrupting his evening. Only found out his name is Renan by my receipt. We will not be back."}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 5/100***  We decided to come here to grab a quick bite before catching a movie on one of the date nights with the hubby. MEH is definitely how I would describe this place. Everything we've tried was mediocre at best. I ordered a turkey sandwich with brie cheese. It lacked the creaminess and nutty flavor the brie should've provided and the French baguette it was in was hard and obviously stale. The husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich which left much to be desired. The dessert was another disappointment, strawberry cheesecake overload which tasted very generic. The prices I feel were too steep for the quality they offered. The only redeeming factor I would say was the cocktail, although towards the last few sips it became overwhelmingly sweet. I'm hoping we'll have better luck with the brunch offerings as I still have a certificate we have yet to redeem. Not in  a big rush though."}
{"text":"Visited Sugar Factory last Saturday around 10pm, It was a nice, casual,\" pre party\" environment, our waiter was really friendly and attentive. I had the \"Hubba Bubba\" martini and the Fried Macaroni & Cheese Pops as an appetizer. The drink was okay, I've had better. The appetizer was really good. I will definitely be back but will be trying a different drink."}
{"text":"The goblet we chose to share was Passion Punch!!! Delicious, with enough alcohol for a nice buzz! Stay tuned... we're coming back later for the food and to share more pics!!!"}
{"text":"So, so sad to write this review.  My husband and I were HUGE fans of the Sugar Factory back when they were at the Paris.  This new location is nice and the decor is fun.    We got the Passion Punch goblet which we got every time prior and this time is was unbelievably sweet with ZERO detectable alcohol.  Bummer because we used to get a little buzz on to start our day on the strip.    Fried Mac and Cheese are no longer triangle squares with breadcrumbs.  Now they are battered in what is like funnel cake batter and then fry them and put them on sticks so they are lollipops.  First, you used to get more... second the thick batter on the outside is just GROSS, third is I found something random and dark brown in one that was questionable.  The side sauce seems to be unchanged and still tasty.    The club sandwich was standard and good - hard to mess up though.   Lastly, our waiter was okay but he was also tending the outside bar.  Problem is I watched him pick his nose/ play with his nose ring MULTIPLE times and then continue touching things. GROSS!  The only reason I ate was because I saw him wash his hands before he brought us our food.    We want to love this location but will not be back.  Hopefully we can get a better experience at one of their other locations."}
{"text":"Came because of the great reviews !! And I'm glad I came !!! So delicious !! From the drink to our small crepe entree!! Wow so tasty & the server (brittney Rhea) was awesome, attentive and very sweet. Too bad I don't live in Vegas or else I would be here on the daily !!!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 11 that went after a movie for brunch.   Pro: wait time was much less than told Greeting was friendly  Waiter was friendly   Con: seated 11 of us with 2 menus          On 3 different occasions they brought other people's drink to our table.   Our food took much longer to be served than it should have. They brought out 3 entrees and the rest of the party's food came out 15 min later.  They forgot one of the kids meals.  When the food finally came out it was cold.   This is my second time here and my first was also a hot mess. The first time it seemed like their Corp people were there and the staff was stiff and nobody smiled.  Food was cold and took forever."}
{"text":"I literally have never wrote a bad review in my life so this is incredibly hard for me. As a local, I have been to sugar factory several times when it was at the sugar factory. for about 2 years, it was actual a frequent date night for me and my boyfriend so when they closed i definitely missed it. When I heard they were reopening another location at fashion show, I had to come and see it.  So I came tonight for my birthday. Let me say, the service was absolutely horrendous. Let me start this by saying it was a Wednesday and there were literally about 5 tables sat in the whole restaurant. It took approximately 10 minutes to get my drink order in and then an additional 20 minutes to even order my food. Throughout this time span, I watched my waiter stand and talk to his coworkers and continue to do his roll ups (as I'm assuming his shift was ending soon) instead of taking our food order.  I come to sugar factory mainly for their amazing desserts and I didn't even order one because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes on my birthday for a dessert.  I will NEVER come to this restaurant again. And as a local who frequented here weekly when it was at the Paris, that's saying a lot. I even used my last bit of cash to pay the bill so I didn't have to wait for my card to get ran.  If you are a local or even a tourist looking for a place to eat, unless you have an hour and a half to spare on just waiting for your food and drink, I would go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! So beautiful inside, the atmosphere was really awesome. Drinks are delicious- chocolate martini? YES!   They had great service and everyone was so nice and attentive!   The food is amazing. I ate the white chocolate burger and it was juicy and the mix of flavors with the white chocolate is genius! I loved it. I will definitely be back again for that!"}
{"text":"The goblet drinks are absolutely amazing! This place has such a fun atmosphere and all of the drinks are very refreshing!  I am headed back to Vegas this summer 2017 and I am so excited to see the new location and enjoy another goblet! So happy you all are back :)"}
{"text":"We celebrated my daughter 's birthday here.  It took us some time to find the restaurant but was worth it. We had a groupon coupon for the party of eight. We were all given a salad and a choice from four selected dinner items and a giant dessert at the end. My daughter said it was her favorite birthday party."}
{"text":"So we went to this place for my wife's birthday. Our time there started on the right foot. When we were seated, one of the managers came to our table and introduced himself. So I thought to myself \"how cool, it should be smooth sailing from here\". But I spoke too soon! We had our two daughters with us and ordered their food food first. When they brought our drinks out, we ordered our food. It took close to an hour (not exaggerating) to get their food out. By that time we were done with our complimentary water and drinks. Never got a refill on my iced tea, but that's besides the point. The rest of our food came out about 30 minutes after our kids' food came out. By this time my wife was a bit upset, she was so looking forward to this restaurant and it did not deliver. What I noticed is that it's more of a bar than a restaurant, because the people at the bar were taking care of customers much better than the wait staff serving food. It was a good thing i got a (Yelp check in discount and a groupon deal) otherwise i would be more upset in paying the high prices and the service doesn't match up to it. if you're looking for a good place to eat, pick somewhere else. But if drinks are what you want, you will have a good time there."}
{"text":"Not a very good place. They ruined my birthday and didn't care. They were out of most of the stuff we ordered, and it was only 6:30pm. Kept trying to up sale us. Wouldn't sing Happy birthday since we didn't order dessert. I wanted the cheese cake ice cream but they were saving the cheese cake for only the milkshakes. Very disappointing.we did say we would pay for the birthday candle, but they wouldn't do it."}
{"text":"Great service, but food wasn't great, unless you buy a dessert they don't acknowledge your birthday or do anything for it...was slightly disappointed especially since it was the sole purpose of our visit for my daughters 16th birthday...prices are a little extreme...drinks were weak for the amount of money paid...sorry just didn't agree with a lot of the reviews...  Soooo the manager reached out to me and fixed all issues that was wrong the first time...although we can't redo a Birthday the second time around was great...food was better and our waitress helped out with our selections so that our food was better...service was still great and they came out to do her birthday. I was grateful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great service!  Sundaes are enormous and can feed a family!"}
{"text":"All I got say is order the apple martini  burgers and ask for manny.. guaranteed for a great experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"They had great service and great food. Fries were seasoned well, steak was melt-in-your-mouth amazing, Yukon mashed potatoes were a delicious delight, and asparagus was grilled to perfection. Definitely recommend to anyone !"}
{"text":"Came here tonight to celebrate our daughter's birthday. All our girls had a fun time with all the fabulous drinks! Our service was absolutely great, food was delicious....will definitely be back when were in Vegas."}
{"text":"I overly enjoyed myself. So much to choose from but decided on the wedge salad and blue cheese steak. Oh and let's not forget the smoking goblet drink. Will return no doubt."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of women for a Ladies Night upstairs in their Chocolate Lounge and the service was so bad I left in the middle of the party. The appetizers themselves were fine but the drinks could not have come out any slower if a snail delivered them! This event was not spontaneous, they knew at least a week ahead of time about our reservation but clearly they were not prepared with ingredients nor wait staff. Of course most of the ladies ordered the big candy goblet drinks which are time consuming but they made one at a time, carried up by elevator (which is shared with other serving staff). We saw one drink delivered to the table every 15-20 minutes on average and some people never got theirs. I got my lemon drop faster than others but felt guilty about drinking in front of friends who didn't have theirs. Rule #1 in restaurants, serve a girl her drank ASAP! Failure to follow this on a ladies night out will result in lots of unhappy women and no one wants that. On top of that, no prices are listed on the menu and when a couple of gals received a $50 charge for a dry ice drink, that soured the experience even more. They never seemed to apologize or even try to rush things. I won't be back.  Bottom line, they are slow, the drinks aren't worth the touristy prices (c'mon, it's sugar water plus candy and a shot of alcohol!). Don't waste your $$$."}
{"text":"We went there on a Monday night, so it wasn't crowded. Daughter who we took to Vegas for her 21st birthday and loves everything Kardashian. It lives up to expectations. I had the peanut butter chocolate martini. It was great. Place was very clean and decent music in background. I can see how the Millennials like it, but I'm a little older to go back. Waitstaff was friendly and kept an eye out for the brand. Dont ask to change anything."}
{"text":"This place is a must do in Vegas especially with kids. The lunch was delicious, the goblet drink was good! Got a little tipsy, husband too, rainbow sliders my kids said were yummy, my chocolate covered milkshake with a cheeseburger was yummy, my husbands club sandwich was good too! We ended our visit with a ice cream sundae with a sparkler for my son's birthday! Everything was great, slow service with one waitress... poor girl, but we were patient and she tried her best! Now this place was good, heck a'pricey but I knew what I was getting myself into and won't reduce their stars because of that! We left satisfied, full bellies, and happy."}
{"text":"My friend and I used a groupon for this location at Town Square, lots of competition to eat elsewhere?? Anyway food is average and a little over priced, nothing to write home about... The pizza was like  Caesar Caesar pizza, just plain for too many $, would not order again, the drinks too much ice, for a few sips, not my kind of alcoholic drinks,, lots of chocolate Martinis . Service was pretty good the last  2 visits,, one more groupon to go and I think it will be the last visit, limited food menu, basic stuff.. No real signal on cell phone  and their wi- fi is hit or miss was able to use the town square one sitting outside..."}
{"text":"My experience here at the beautifully designed restaurant was BitterSweet. Alfredo, is Great! He will do well and move up quickly, if that's what he wants to do. Now Alfredo, sales me on coming in to try some of there signature drinks that start at $44. My time here, also being that I'm not a tourist, the drinks would always be available to me. I'm more of a Foodie, and I did Love my Turkey Burger with crumbled Bleu cheese, sauteed mushrooms and onions. With a side order of chargrilled asparagus for my side dish. Now after waiting for the actual waiter Betty to appear after waiting for a small glass of water 10 minutes. I explained to her, that I'd never eating here before. She didn't make or offer any suggestions to me. Just was kinda on a mission I guess her shift was almost over after me..so I asked, Could she give me a few minutes more?\" She replied, \"Sure thing\" and left for about 12 minutes more this time. I really didn't make too much of a stink being that she may've been Bombarded with an Abundance of customers to tend too. I ordered finally, my food was \"Superb.\" I guess I wasn't moving fast enough for this young lady. She reappeared at my table with in 10 minutes more asking, \"Was I done?\" I looked at her with half a sandwich left and shoed her away..this may've been wrong but I didn't like feeling as if my table had a meter on it. Now, I'm not getting hyped up just because I knew I'd be asking for the GM's email or speaking with the higher up before I left this establishment. I waited for I guess the shift changing, I did see the morning shift manager tell one of the hostess' that he didn't have time at the moment he'd be back..13 to 14 minutes went by before I spoke with a very caring an also intuned individual about what he's been experiencing since he's lived in Vegas as well. Geraldo was an is a splendid General Manager. Hopefully he can stay here to whip the staff into shape per say literally...it's disgusting to pay for services and then the server's are expecting a 5-18% tip..this usually is what I give IF I'm treated with courteous behavior. Geraldo reassured me that he'd speak with this young lady. He was also very aplogetic because of what had accurred.This situation that had me a little hot and bothered. Betty and the day shifts manager need additional coaching or more frequent breaks. Just a suggestion. Overall my food was Fabulous, the Proprietors are worth all the praises as well. Thanks! I will return."}
{"text":"The first time we came to sugar factory it wasn't the best experience, unfortunately. However,  they reached out and wanted to make it right. I told the young man at the door I had a reservation and he knew my first and last name which I thought was pretty awesome. He walked us in and to our table and almost immediately our server Terri came and introduced herself and went over some menu items with us in a way that wasn't so \"robotic\". It was very conversational and when we asked questions she was able to answer them for us. Terri was super sweet and friendly.  Now, you may be thinking \"well, they're gonna be extra nice this time around. They're making up for last time\". Not at all. We noticed the other customers were receiving the same treatment and service, which shows this wasn't just for me. I strongly believe my first experience was a one off, and I thank Jennevive for extending out an invitation to show us. We had a great time, great drinks, food. Can't wait to come back! In the mean time I'll enjoy my own drinks out of my souvenir cup! Couldn't resist!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see that the Sugar Factory full restaurant was back on the strip and bought the Groupon to get the goblet drink of course. We orders the Mai Tai goblet, not my favorite. I would get the white gummy bear or the one with the lollipops and candy necklace ( I forget the name) I recommend coming here for one drink and that is it. The food is overpriced and not worth it. We ordered  the spinach dip appetizer which was a pretty decent sized portion but they give you like 4 pieces of tiny sourdough crisps. We asked for more once we finished and still had plenty of dip left and they come back with another 4. (Maybe it was 6 but still not nearly enough to finish the dip). I saw two birthday parties going on while I was there and the giant Birthday sundae seemed pretty cool. I'm somewhat disappointed in this new location. I miss when it used to be at Paris, it seemed a lot nicer there."}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 18 for my friends' birthday. At first they set us at a table that was a bit too small. After a bit, they accommodated to make the table bigger, which was nice of them.  The waiter was very patient in checking a bunch of IDs so we could try the cocktails. Two friends got goblets, which were great! You couldn't really taste the alcohol, and they had great candies inside. I got the Sexual Chocolate. The alcohol taste was a bit overwhelming in that one, so next time I'll be getting it without alcohol (which you can do with all of the drinks).  Now onto the food. Oh boy.. again, the waiter was very patient with us as we ordered. It took a while for the food to come out, but that's to be expected when you come with a large party. We got food ranging from pasta to burgers. No one had any mix ups with their orders, and everyone's food came out mostly with no gaps. I got the Fettuccini Alfredo with a side of onion rings. Although the pasta portion was small, it tasted great! I'm actually glad the portion was smaller because too much pasta isn't always a great thing. The onion rings were great too! Everyone finished their meals without leftovers. The only downside was that it took an hour to get the check. However, the waiter was really nice in splitting all of them without mix ups.  Overall, my experience was a good one and I will be back."}
{"text":"Another great dining experience in Las Vegas . . . Not on the Strip!! We were warmly greeted upon arrival and seated quickly. (NOTE: They also accept reservations.) The atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. Seating options: bar, bar height tables, booth and regular tables. Every seat is a great seat. Drinks were great (Mai Tai goblet [60oz] and Goose Island Honker's Ale).  Lizzy, the bartender, makes a mean Mai Tai. Our server (J.R.) was superb. For dinner, we had salmon, chicken pasta, and a burger. Dinner was served hot and cooked to order (even for the gluten free person in our party).  We met Mike and Dennis (managers). They were really great, down to earth. The owner, Tom, was very personable. Monday night: happy hour 3pm to close (football season) Wednesday night: free champagne with fondue for 4  Looking for a fun spot with great food and good vibes, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"This place sucks ass! It's my 21st birthday & not only did I have to sit and wait 20 min for my drink but everyone else had to wait too. Twenty minutes for a Stella, are you serious?! They ran out of goblets so I didn't even get the full effect with my family. Then on top of that I am stuck sitting here waiting for my food when only bits and pieces are coming out. I really don't appreciate having to sit here and wait for absolutely nothing. There is no such thing as quality here & I'm extremely disappointed. The one at the Paris is amazing but this one at town square is the biggest disappointment ever. Thanks sugar factory for ruining my 21st. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Came in yesterday (11-20-17@12ish) for some brunch and waited so long for our waiter MARC ANTHONY A to come and greet us. First time here and it'll be my last.   I ordered a shake for my daughter and was told that the Ice cream machine is broken..  (Note: I came in about a hourish before the place opened) If I didn't order my meal I would've left the place bc that's the only reason why I was here."}
{"text":"Great food, yummy and fantabulous drink. Our server ,Lauren, was awesome. Good place for group and birthday celebrants... :-) will be back for sure. #foodporn"}
{"text":"Went to sugar factory for my 25th birthday. Me & my boyfriend order 2 drinks & a basket of fries & we paid $40 plus a $10 gratuity (there was 5 people in our party). $50 for 2 drinks & a basket of fries?! Not to mention our waitress Chrissy was making inappropriate comments about how she doesn't like when they play Spanish music bc this isn't a Mexican restaurant... she then went on about they don't even sell Mexican food & it doesn't make sense to her that they would play Spanish music. My boyfriend & best friend are both Mexican & sitting right there so it was very uncomfortable for everyone. She was so unprofessional & didn't even seem to realize that what she was saying might make us uncomfortable considering my boyfriends name is Jose & he looks obviously Mexican.. really ruined the experience for me because I did like the ambiance. Then on top of everything she said Jose's card was not reading & she wouldn't be able to accept it. Even though it worked fine everywhere else. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with mine & my fiance's family to celebrate his birthday. The service started horrible from servers not knowing what alcohols were in their specialty drinks to receiving the wrong order and my mom receiving her grilled cheese sandwich after we all almost finished our meal. I shared the feedback of our experience with the Manager as I am very observant in customer service. The recovery made by the manager was ok but there was another gentleman that seemed like an investor or owner of the restaurant who checked on us and made the best recovery I have ever experienced first hand. I am in customer service and I was highly impressed and would return again because I know the top line does care. This place is new so I am sure once the front line is trained more, they will be great."}
{"text":"My husband and I brought our little girls into Sugar Factory for dinner about a week ago. I am not writing this review because of the food, I am writing it because of the service! We had a server named Jessica and she made our experience amazing!! I am a server/bartender and I am very picky when it comes to service. She blew the roof off of that place! She made my girls feel so special and made us want to come back just to hang out with her. She made me feel like we were best friends :) If you go to Sugar Factory in Town Square, ask for Jessica!!"}
{"text":"Awesome  food and awesome service!  Definitely recommend the frozen hot chocolate!   Oh, and huge servings! I got much more than I expected!"}

Sprawling in size with glitz, glitter, and glamour to spare as $30 lollipops lined the walls it was to the tunes of Britney followed by Daft Punk that we arrived to the semi-shrouded entrance and soon seated it would not be long before the first of several slick-talking servers stopped by, a 'cool' vibe clearly part of the training though not particularly well sold as a multitude of check-ins bordered on annoying.  Undoubtedly a loud space, both literally and in the visual sense, it was to the tally of three plates plus two drinks that our $70 experience unfolded and with both drinks living up to the soda-sweet branding the desserts would mostly follow suit, the $13 slice of stuffed French Toast served with white chocolate alongside pure maple syrup doughy and underwhelming while a 3-scoop sundae and fruit-tinged carrot cake proved better, the former more than enough to share and the later a well balanced concoction of lightly sweetened frosting juxtaposing densely spiced cake.  Certainly not a spot for subtlety and thereby de facto 'celebrity' suffice it to say my Sugar Factory curiosity is satisfied but with Serendipity offering up a better experience in a similar vein I can't say I'll be rushing back, though I won't rule out an early morning breakfast at the 24/7 flagship sometime to see how they compare."}
{"text":"Born out of Las Vegas and now identified as a place to sip gigantic bubbling drinks, eat fun food and spot celebrities from New York to Dubai, it would be hard to say Sugar Factory is not one of the most successful concepts to ever spawn from Sin City, owner Charissa Davidovici somehow managing to turn $30 Lollipops into high fashion frequently spotlighted in Social Media feeds of everyone from Drake and Shaq to a disproportionate number of Jenners and Kardashians.  Originally launched in 2010 where HeXx now resides, a second location at Town Square also opened and shuttered in the interim, Sugar Factory American Brasserie was recently re-introduced at Fashion Show Mall with a multi-million dollar overhaul and several 'grand openings,' a visit on Friday Night showing the space to be every bit as audacious as one might guess, both in terms of the eye-catching décor and the over-the-top menu executed in a kitchen led by Chef Bryan Ogden.  Without doubt a spectacle, the French Brasserie façade and giant Rubber Ducky quickly giving way to walls donned with \"Dots\" and photographs of celebrities as Rihanna 'Shines bright like a Diamond' at about 80 decibels overhead, it was with pleasant greetings that three guests were met at the hostess podium and led to a sizable six-top facing Las Vegas Boulevard, a young man named Erick providing great service throughout a nearly 2-hour evening.  Focused as much on the concept and environment as the food, a 'theme' restaurant in many ways but in general American as relates to the fare, it was after a quick visit from Chef Ogden who was most recently seen at Boca Park's Mixx Grill that a few items were ordered with a request for Bryan to 'fill in the gaps' family style, a brief wait spent watching the NBA Playoffs played on LCDs in back as sparkling candles zigzagged through the room as part of at least seven birthday celebrations.  Attempting to balance A/C with open doors, a tough task as Vegas neared 100°F for the first time in 2017, it was after a bit more perusal that the decision was made to invest in one of Sugar Factory's $36 Goblets, the 60oz White Gummi featuring fresh-pressed Juice, dueling Cruzan Rums and a whole lot of Ice served bubbling at the tableside with Gummy Worms laced throughout a concoction that was at first quite sweet before unveiling a more spirit-heavy finish.  Making a low ceilinged first-floor look much bigger by way of crystal chandeliers and a lot of mirrors, the glass doors looking out towards Wynn and an open patio enough to keep the inside feeling secluded yet still accessible, it was after perhaps twenty minutes that savories came forth in back-to-back waves, the first two plates featuring Sugar Factory's spin on Chicken and Waffles with a golden half-bird laid across two crisp waffles tinged in Chives plus a sidecar of Maple-Cheddar Mornay and 3 Fish Tacos flawed by cold Tortillas that fell apart almost the second one tried to pick them up.  Not making any attempt to be a 'serious' restaurant, but rather a fun place for food and drinks in a City made for such things, round two saw Chef Ogden send out Sugar Factory's recently launched \"Rainbow Sliders\" aligned in the same color-order as the restaurant's signature signage as well as \"The Big Cheesy,\" a thick patty of Angus cooked medium-rare beneath crispy Bacon, house BBQ Sauce and a big scoop of Mac n' Cheese-a delicious idea that isn't so weird when you think about the ingredients.  Delving into three \"insane\" Milkshakes, an idea that seems to be gaining a lot of traction recently as restaurateurs put stock in Instagram's ability to drive short-term traffic, Sugar Factory goes all-in with three pages of choices, each seemingly more decadent than the next with the Twinkie Dinkie not dissimilar to drinking Birthday Cake in terms of its taste while the Giggles Snickers is essentially melt-resistant given the thickness created by Cookies, Peanuts, Chocolate Chips and Candybars, the Caramel Sugar Daddy further upping the ante by putting a whole wedge of Cheesecake on top of a Chocolate and Graham Cracker-coated mug full of the taste of a Sugar Daddy infusing a texture almost as smooth as Cannoli filling.  Fully aware that occupation and fascination were in conflict at this point, Sugar Factory proving as appropriate a name as any for a restaurant with an attached Candy shop and Chocolate Lounge upstairs, the meal came to an end by way of three desserts in two waves, items from the \"Gourmet Ice Cream Sandwiches\" section including two rich Brownies wrapped around Vanilla Ice Cream while a hemisected Doughnut was essentially a two-person Sundae with a duo of Sauces, Ice Cream, Fudge and Berries, the Caramel Brownie Bread Pudding served last a contrast of temperature, texture and flavor as the piping hot Brioche and Custard quickly melted Ice Cream and Whipped Cream into a pool around chunks of Fudge and Orange-Caramel Sauce that the youngster in the group likened to the taste of Fruity Pebbles"}
{"text":"My short review: relatively loud environment, ridiculous wait times, not really worth the money.    The long: Not the atmosphere I was expecting at all. But that's on me. Loud pop music and the whole restaurant was relatively small. They have small upstairs lounge so I suppose that could make up for it. The food was good but the main problem and the real reason behind my rating is the wait time! Do not come to this restaurant if you have somewhere to be afterwards. We started by ordering drinks. 15 minutes later we ordered appetizers. About 15 minutes later they brought our appetizers and we ordered the entreé. 20 minutes later they. Rought the entreé. And then 10 minutes later they brought the drinks we ordered (remember those?) after we were done we asked for a to go box which took about another 10 minutes. And then we waited about 25 minutes for them to bring the check! All in all we were probably in this restaurant 2 extra hours that we didn't need to be. I don't plan on coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Want an over the top family dining experience in Las Vegas?  Then look no further than Sugar. This place is unlike any other. The menu is thick with interesting choices. Very good selection of appies, salads, burgers, anytime breakfast, pizzas, sandwiches and their over the top selection of fishbowl drinks, specialty drinks and specialty milkshakes.   We had a wonderful server Richard who was attentive and accommodating. We ordered 2 fishbowl drinks. One with alcohol ($38) and one without ($30) for our boys (ages 12 & 14). They are fun with the dry ice inside. Sweet as you'd expect in a place called sugar and for extra sweetness they add candy to the drinks.  We ordered an appetizer platter and the Sloppy Joe burger. Not everyone was hungry so we didn't order multiple meals. Appetizer platter had wings (good), onion rings (very good), chicken fingers (ok, not special) and amazing deep fried mac n cheese balls. Amazing!  And I'm not a huge mac n cheese fan. The sloppy joe burger was very tasty as were the thin fries that came with it.   We left stuffed and with our drinks Vegas style in to-go cups. Would go back next Vegas trip. Used a Groupon which helped lower the total cost."}
{"text":"We went to this place after a friend said how great it was.  We had 7 in our party for brunch.  We sat down and literally it was at least 15 mins before we asked someone if there was anyone waiting on us.  The coffee was cold, eggs were overcooked so then they said they would take that off of the bill when my husband said forget it and don't bring me anything.  He was so upset.  The service was horrible and we will never go back."}
{"text":"Sugar Factory is known for their oversized drinks that have a smoking effect. They also offer food. I ordered the Philly burger. There was cheese sauce on it that just took the burger to the next level for my taste buds. It was delicious! It came with regular thin cut fries. The burger filled me up and then some. The decor in the restaurant is really unique. The colors and lighting makes the restaurant look very vibrant. No complaints for a casual lunch or dinner here. The restaurant also offers breakfast but I have not had any of the breakfast items. The drinks are very good too. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We came to see what the Instagram hype was all about.   We ordered drinks 35$ a piece for somewhat 60 oz drinks.  They did taste pretty good. We also ordered appetizers which tastes great. We got a free Nutella pizza no one wanted but had a ton of peanut butter. No one complained about it but does anyone complain about free food?  Overall it was an okay place, would def go back to order entrées."}
{"text":"If you love chocolate the peanut butter martini is like a melted peanut butter cup.  The cheese plane huge.  A great place to stop for a drink or quick bite"}
{"text":"I asked my server a question about the menu, he said he had no idea and said he would give me a minute to think about what else I wanted- How about an answer to my question??!! . He didn't offer to ask someone else or MAYBE EVEN THE KITCHEN?!! (Hmmmm...Who would have thought the kitchen might know something about the menu?) Anyway, I was so annoyed that I was over it and just wanted to walk out. I WONT BE BACK. Ps their MENU IS REALLY LIMITED and I could have gotten better food at Denny's. 1 extra star only because I liked the decor, otherwise I would have given this place 1 star."}
{"text":"Very attentive/friendly staff. Beautiful decor inside restaurant. Chinese chicken salad and buffalo chicken salad were both delicious. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken spinach mushroom crepe, and my son had the chicken fettuccine it was delicious. And the decor is lovely. Beautiful chandeliers."}
{"text":"The food was Amazing just like our phenomenal server Stephen! The insane shakes were... well insane. If you are in Las Vegas you have to try this place! Stephen gave us wonderful recommendations and was very attentive and took great care of us."}
{"text":"We've visited twice in 2 days. Good service,  creative and delicious drinks and the food is good. Get the spinach dip!!"}
{"text":"Just no. Very disappointing as I was hoping it would be decent. We went for breakfast.  We ask for coffee. They, currently, do not have regular coffee. The coffee machine is broken! They offer us free Americana espresso, yet I want regular coffee. Not good. We turn the offer down and just tell them that it's OK to be polite, but it's not OK. Then I found out, as my friend heard it, that after saying the espresso would be free, the waiter corrected himself and said it would cost the same as the coffee and not more. I order the egg white omelette with spinach.. it is simple... no cheese, with rye toast and BK potatoes. Healthy meal... so excited... the meal comes: The menu forgot to mention how bland the omelette is going to be. It also forgets to say that the joke is on me due to how much oil the omelette and the breakfast potatoes are clearly cooked in, as they are swimming in oil. It looks healthy... but it's not! I also ordered the rye toast... A bit chewy. So, what was the best part of the meal? It was the water. What made the whole experience that much worse is that we had a waiter that thought he was being funny but was actually very annoying ( sorry.. I feel bad writing about this but it's a fact). Neither my friend or I finished our meals. My friend ordered the American breakfast with two eggs and bacon, and not only was hers bland but she commented that she wished she had made her own breakfast at home this morning as she could easily make this and hers would've been 10 times better. The waiter actually said \"I bet you guys did not finish your meals because you want dessert\". Sugar factory may be known for sweets, but that is not what adults usually ask for when it comes to breakfast. It may be better for dinner or especially for strong drinks... I don't know... That is not my thing. I know that the top chefs make it very clear that if you are going to cook anything in your restaurant, it needs to be top notch. This restaurant miserably failed at breakfast. I do not plan on coming back for any meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Chinese chicken salad is my favorite. Drew is cute and single come see him ;)"}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE DURING MY STAY IN LAS VEGAS!!!! My fiancé and I were walking by and thought the place was so cute so we decided to walk in and check it out, it was very empty, only us and another group. We were given a menu, and the waitress went over a few drinks with us. there was so many options but we didn't want any drinks we wanted a dessert, So we asked for strawberries with chocolate. Well I don't know for what reason but they wouldn't sell them to us. She left and came back saying they didn't have that, and didn't even offer us anything else!! and took the menu away!! Basically Asking us to leave for not buying a drink!! Funny part was that when we walked past the bar to walk out, we saw they clearly had strawberries right there. I don't understand for what reason she didn't want to dip a few in chocolate, the plater only includes 6 strawberries, it's not like I'm asking you to give me all the strawberries for the rest of the day. And I'm pretty sure you guys have chocolate. It's like you either by a drink or get out at this place, Or either they were too lazy to make some. This is the First and last time we come to this place.  NO, I do recommend this place to absolutely anyone, don't let the cute looks from outside fool you, the employees are rude and lazy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the Sugar Factory location that used to be over at Paris.  I thought the food and drinks were delicious there!  So I was pretty excited when I found out they were opening a new location at Fashion Show Mall.  I've been here a couple of times now since they opened.  Service was \"meh\" the first time and we were told they were out of dry ice so I couldn't get the goblet that I wanted.  What kind of business that specializes in these drinks runs out of dry ice?!  That was a huge disappointment, but toward the end of our meal, we found out that they had some dry ice in so I placed an order for a non-alcoholic Watermelon Patch goblet.  At the time it was half off with Yelp check-in, which was great since those drinks are pricey, but the deal is no longer offered.  I got to take a cool video of it as the drink was made and it started to smoke, but it could have been smokier in my opinion :p  Taste-wise it was nothing spectacular to be honest, but it was pretty refreshing and handy to take to-go with me since it was such a hot day.  As for the food, I had the Sugar Factory Club, which was totally average.  Even though food and service were not great on that visit, I wanted to come back to try their Caramel Sugar Daddy Cheesecake \"insane Shake.\"   On that visit, service was better, but not their food.  I got their tomato bisque which was not very good.  It came with cheddar brioche toast which I liked but there wasn't enough of.  The shake WAS pretty insane!  I had to take off the rainbow lollipop and Sugar Daddy to drink it and was given bags to put them in and take home.  The cheesecake that came with it was pretty good.  The shake itself was plain but tasted better with the caramel, which I wish there could have been more of.  I'll give three stars because the goblets and drinks are fun and Instagram-worthy :p  But the food is just not good (and the pasta dish I loved is no longer on the menu) and the service hit or miss, so now that I've tried what I wanted to try, I don't think I'll be coming back here."}
{"text":"We got to Vegas from Mississippi and this was the first stop. What a great place! Atmosphere, drinks, service, bartenders (Nell is hilarious), awesome. It's a must see!"}
{"text":"We actually visited the Paris location a couple of years back and remembered that we left pretty happy. Our party of five returned to the Fashion Show location on a Sunday night and we weren't all that impressed. The weekend dining time and atmosphere wasn't conducive for a family dinner and the service was slow and not very helpful with the daunting menu. When we did finally get our food and drink, we did enjoy it, but it wasn't quite enough to save the overall experience.  We were seated immediately for our 7:30 reservation time to a crowded restaurant with very loud music and even louder screaming and yelling echoing throughout the room (listen to my video). We had a lengthy five minute greet which gave those in our party who had not dined at a Sugar Factory before, a chance to review the voluminous menu. When the server arrived, the only introduction we received was her giving us her name and she immediately asking if we were ready to order without any review of the menu or even one suggestion. When she finally took our order, she was unfamiliar with the menu overall, especially my branzino entree and could not even find it on her ordering pad. Service from the bar was exceptionally slow. It was so slow that we received our entrees before we received our goblets. I'll be generous and say it took 25 minutes for us to receive our drinks that weren't appropriately garnished because they ran out of the gummy candy for their Drake, which was their signature goblet.  The menu is about 30+ pages with about 75% of it being flavored alcohol drinks, desserts, and pictures of celebrities. The food is for the most part American and everyone was actually pleased with what they received. I was happy they served the salty, crispy branzino skin side up to contrast the soft, mild flesh. I actually had a taste of my daughter's nutella crepe and it would be a good option for those wanting to stay on the sweet theme for their entrees. Although the goblets did pack a nice punch, when the mist cleared, the overpowering sweetness and the dry ice show were not worth the $38 price of admission for me.  Of course you have to get dessert at Sugar Factory, but our server did not even bring the word up and just dropped off the check. Maybe our $200 tab was enough already and she wanted to just turn the table over? So we paid it and had dessert elsewhere. I have no issues paying $40/person for a meal, but I expect stellar service, not service I would receive at a 24/7 diner. A non peak hour visit, which I would have to debate heavily, would probably result in better service. On the weekend nights, Sugar Factory is best for the large groups celebrating a special occasion, such as a birthday or bachelorette party, where you can get your drink on with foo-foo drinks, be boisterous and happy, and where you might forget about the prices you're paying and the service you're receiving."}
{"text":"We went to Town Square to see Fury and wanted to try a new place to eat. The Sugar Factory had half off burgers and appetizers. I ordered the blue cheese burger, my boyfriend had a pizza burger, and we shared the fried mac and cheese balls. My blue cheese burger was soggy, tasted like plastic (maybe from blue cheese?) and the bun tasted stale to me. It was okay, but I have had so much better. I tried a bite of my boyfriend's pizza burger and I felt so sorry for him. It was disgusting. :( He isn't as picky as me. I gave him the rest of my burger and finished off the mac and cheese balls.  Meh."}
{"text":"Monique was the freaking best EVER! She was all over our table and we weren't even her table. She was fun and attentive. Ingyin was freaking awesome too. Will totally be back to sit with them! They even asked us to guess how to spell their name and guess what? We got it right!"}
{"text":"Oh Sugar Factory, I have a love/hate relationship with you!  I have been to this Sugar Factory quite often since it's been open in Town Square. I was very excited it opened in Town Square since  becoming a local in 2011 I don't get to the strip much unless I have friends and family visiting.   That being said, here are some of my loves!  I love the red velvet hot chocolate! It's rich and delicious, and just plain yummy! I could drink it all week if I had to!  I'm obsessed with their tomato soup! Maybe it's because it brings back fond memories to when I was little having tomato soup and grilled cheese on cold days!  The drink menu!!! What a variety of tasty signature drinks! Try the White Gummi, you will be glad you did! Half the fun is trying to fish the gummy worms/bears out!   The hates: ok not really hates, but annoyances...  The service could be better. A lot better. The servers we have had are all sweet as the desserts they serve. They just aren't attentive. There was one night I went in with two other people, and we didn't get greeted for over 10 minutes. Another time, again the girl was sweet enough, but she disappeared! When I was in there tonight, or server although sweet and very informative, but she was hard to find as well!   Overall food and drinks are yummy to the max! Service needs a little TLC.... Work on that part and everything will be 100%!!!!"}
{"text":"The place is beautiful but the food is just okay. I actually had a gift card to use there that they would not honor even after I called ahead of time to verify. I actually showed the bartender the gift card before I ordered and she said okay. I ordered and ate my breakfast. When presented with the check, I gave her the card and was having problems entering it. She went to speak to the manager who then, turns to me to tell me he has no way of processing the gift card since the different Sugar Factory locations use different POS systems. He offered no resolution to how I could redeem the gift card and was quite abrupt. Very disappointed in customer service and organization of Sugar Factory to allow this to types of situations to occur."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and management. Will never come back. I came here to celebrate my birthday and made a reservation a week ahead. They sat us upstairs and no one came to greet us or anything for over 30 mins, and It took 45 minutes to even get water after we sat down. The food was sub par, but after complaining to the manager (who didn't even have a name tag and never even apologized) about the lack of service, he did absolutely nothing besides split our checks up for us. Worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Oh and the waitress never even brought my \"birthday surprise\" that cost $10. I've been to the old location at the Paris Hotel several times and it was great! But this new location is totally different now and I will never return."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Wonderful service! Chaz was our server and he was quick on getting our orders and made sure we were happy with our food and drinks. We didn't like the taste of one of the goblets and they replaced it without hesitation. Alex the manager even gave our children lollipops for free. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"SO RUDE! Went with a group of families, excited for a fun and memorable meal. We had purchased Groupons to help off set the cost of the $19 milkshakes, etc. Upon being seated we notified the server of our plans, I feel it's courteous to address it at the beginning. Our server immediately lashed out at the idea of us using more than one per table. Apparently that is a rule of the fine print, which he ran back to prove with their laminated copy, laminated- which tells me this is a recurring issue. He refused to accommodate us in anyway. Not even moving to two tables - \"we all walked in together so we are set as a group.\"  Following even misguided rules is fine and had the server, or any of the staff we spoke with, addressed the issue with the slightest compassion for the inconvenience or miss understanding, we would have happily stayed. I am still appalled at the lack of costumer service.  Instead we left and it became a good learning experience for our children to see that you don't spend your money at rude, disrespectful establishments. If they are so against using Groupons, they shouldn't offer one."}
{"text":"My wife and I had never been to the sugar factory so we wanted to try it out. We weren't too hungry so I ordered the spinach dip which was pretty good! My wife had a club sandwich. The kicker is their club comes with avocado which paired really well with the sandwich, now i feel like it's a must have for me on a club.   We also tried the goblet drink called the \"Drake\". They fill your goblet with peach candies, dry ice, and cotton candy and pour \"60oz\" of liquor over it for the show. I highly doubt it's really 60oz. It may be 24oz that fills up a 60oz goblet because all the candy and Ice in the goblet. The drink was very good but my wife and I finished it without a buzz at all. In my opinion not worth the $45 bucks but it's a cool show and it taste good."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in for dinner and I couldn't have been more pleased! Our server, Matt, was absolutely wonderful. He was personable and easy to talk to and joke with. He recommended the entree I ordered, (blue cheese bacon burger, YUM!) and a goblet cocktail. Everything was delicious and so worth every penny.  The service was on point, nothing took a long time to come from the kitchen, and for being in the industry, I couldn't have been more impressed. I will definitely be returning!! :)"}
{"text":"This is the only candy-only store in the MGM. They have all the regular candies, as well as a bunch of specialty confections, like giant gummy bears and chocolate-covered pretzels.  There's also a small selection of cold beverages.  And as for bulk candy, there are lot of selections along one wall.  When I walked by, I only bought a bottled water, but I'm sure I'll need a sugar high later this weekend and will be coming by here to get my sweets on."}
{"text":"Chelsea was absolutely amazing.  Me and my friend sat at the bar in and enjoyed the lollipop smoking goblet.  She took a bunch of pictures of us because Lord knows I needed one for yelp, for Instagram and Snapchat and she's so cool and patient and amazing!  Thanks first starting our evening of fun off right!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here strictly for the goblet, I was told it was a must! The atmosphere was great! and the place is really cute! I've head a lot of celebs work with this place, and now I know why! I def reccomend anyone to try this place while here in vegas, although I didnt get to try the food but im sure its great too, ganna have to try that next time. The only thing that sucked was the goblet drinks were real expensive. I didnt realize it was about $40 without tip just for ONE, my husband and I just ended up getting one to share, probably wouldnt be getting another one but other than the price I def will be back!"}
{"text":"Me (Ms. Angela B VIP) and my twin sister Angelique turnt up here at the Chocolate Lounge in the SugarFactory at the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas strip for our birthday...we had a blast...I definitely recommend this...shout out to Manger Shaun for everything...service was great...it's a beautiful atmosphere...it's like your in candyland...if you haven't been there or seen it you're missing out...great experience!"}
{"text":"Friendly and helpful service. The shakes are crazy! Crazy and good! The atmosphere was clean and modern. There are a lot of visuals. We liked how it was attached to the mall as we stopped by after a day of shopping. Wish we tried the food. This is definitely a place to stop for dessert though!"}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant for Sunday brunch. I called to make reservations and was told that they only do walk it's but the wait was 20 mins. Cool. I get to the door 15 minutes later and the wait turns into 45 minutes. At this point I was starving so I asked to sit at the bar.  The bar was pretty big and had about 3 couples sitting down. I saw a few open tables which made me question why there was a 45 minute wait. Any who, it takes about 15 minutes for the bartender to ask for my drink order. I mentioned that I was ready to order my food as well since I was more than ready to eat, and she asked if I could wait. I then noticed that she was the only bar tender in the restaurant serving not only the bar and our orders, but making all of the bottomless mimosas for the entire restaurant. Therefore it took 40 minutes for my food to come out and my order was wrong. I had to ask for a manager to rush my order because it was getting ridiculous. I ate an hour later with 1 mimosa, in which one of the managers had to run to the store to buy more champagne.....   I will never dine here again. Good luck with those Groupons out there, the staffing is terrible and the food isn't ANYthing special. Our bartender was working very hard might I say. She had black hair with tattoos."}
{"text":"Went to eat here after work hearing that they have 50% off goblets. I made a reservation at 330pm and arrived on time and the hostess was very polite and friendly and sat me right away. The busser dropped waters right and away and didn't see my server to greet me until 15 mins later. All he said was \"are you ready to order\". Myself and my party just ordered right away being on that spot and never saw my server again for awhile. We ordered the rainbow sliders, chicken quesadillas, and the night owl goblet. Our food arrived 15 mins after ordering and our server is no where to be found and by the time we're half way done with our food our drinks arrived.. it was so disappointing to know that our drink came after mid way of eating our food. The restaurant wasn't busy during that time. I would have understood if it was peak business hours but it wasn't. He didn't even clear our empty plates, he didn't ask how our food was, or anything! He came during the end and said \"you ready to pay\" we jsut didn't want to be there anymore and paid and asked to split the check. Our server told me to use my phone to calculate the spilt for the amount. First of all. YOUR the server, that's your job  it's just two cards to spilt down the middle. I wouldn't go back again. They have such a good name but such poor service."}
{"text":"Took the kids to celebrate. Regretted it the minute we sat down. Small portions on the actual food(wish we'd ordered the Mac & cheese lollipops). They actually \"ran out\" of chicken strips (what the heck) so our youngest was really disappointed with her dinner. Hunny & I split dinner and my eldest split dinner. We let the kids get dessert as well, as the place is known for its dessert. It was ok - definitely not worth the cost. An experience for sure, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Drinks were super cool! Staff could use a course on costumer service. Went up stairs to the chocolate lounge, inquired with the bartender on sitting upstairs, which was met with a rude response, said, \"Thanks, we'll take our seat downstairs.\" Told them we were there for a 21st birthday celebration. Our server, Manny, sang for another table but never got around to sing for us. In a two hour visit, got a drink refill once. After waiting 20 minutes, finally went up to ask how we get our bill. On a Monday night, not busy at all, surprised that the service was that poor."}
{"text":"This place is usually packed but definitely worth the wait. The food is delicious from the appetizers all the way to the dessert. Great for people with a sweet tooth. Save some money for the candy store because the candy is amazing. They also have people on standby to let you try samples of most of the candy. The special lollipops are a little overpriced though."}
{"text":"This is definitely a great spot to start the night before heading out to a club. The service is amazing and it server, Anthony, really took care of our group even though half of our party of 18 didn't show up. They even got the birthday girl a complementary drink and shots for everyone. It's best to bring big groups and the specialty drinks really hit the spot."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. So was our server Anthony. He made our visit to sugar factory special. Since this was our first time. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place is decorated awesome, food is delicious, and the cheesecake is one of the best I have ever had!! Service was a little slow which is why they lost a star, but otherwise the experience was great. I had the margarita pizza and the banana alcoholic beverage that smokes when they bring it out. Def a must do if you go here."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere...yes! Yummy drinks....yes! Great customer service yes!!! Pizza... No no no! I'm sure I will be returning again definitely to take advantage of the great happy hour special, but I will not be ordering the pizza again, no thank you!!"}
{"text":"Food was good and the service was great!  I even got a birthday treat, thank you for making it special!"}
{"text":"The waitress was nice! And my goblet & my boyfriend's milkshake was good. The food was decent. But the price, omg, so overpriced! I didn't even know the price of the goblet until after my boyfriend paid. I liked what we ordered, but because of the price, I probably won't be coming back.. even as a local :( They need to lower their prices & maybe then they'll get more customers!!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that you come to for all the hype and the experience. We had a Groupon for $40 off but the bill was over $100 for 2 people and 5 things so we were disappointed. However, I would come back because we learned our lesson, and you just have to know what to get. We got 2 soups, one of the goblets and 2 burgers. The French onion soup was bland and my sister's was actually artichoke dip when she looked under the cheese. It was an honest and funny mistake, however it took 10 minutes for the server to come over and get it exchanged. We got the signature lollipop goblet and it was weak. More tarty and sweet than anything else. That turned out to be $40 bucks and a huge disappointment. I think it's worth maybe 25 or 30, and then you should be able to add shots. We saw some things on the cocktail menu that we could get but being as though this was our first and probably last time for a while we decided to get what the place was known for. Meh. I will say we ended on a high note with the burgers though. Had the bleu cheese bacon and the white chocolate burger. Both were great! So next time we're in Vegas we think we'll go back and try other drinks and stick to just the burgers (and definitely try dessert  since we'll have a little extra money in our budget)"}
{"text":"You guys tried to remove my review but in fact this was the right location and I'm going to post it again here. Nice try.  I will never go to this restaurant again. Last night was my birthday and my family and I decided to go to the Sugar Factory to celebrate. The waiter was hard to track down after 10 minutes of being seated. We had made a reservation and our Hostess didn't acknowledge the fact that my husband had told them it was my birthday and they just put us wherever. We told the waiter it was my birthday and he actually wrote my name down and then that was it. No song, No scoop of ice cream with the candle perhaps, nothing. My salad/meal was the caliber of of a side salad and it was $24. Complete rip-off! This was my birthday dinner?! Never again. And they wanted $10 To come out and sing Happy Birthday and give us some sort of dessert is what my husband told me later. If I had known this I would have gone anywhere else for my birthday celebration. Very bad service and not a good place to celebrate your birthday!"}
{"text":"Carrie the bartender was so amazing !!! She made the most incredible drinks and was so super duper nice If I lived in Vegas I would return over and over for her and the goblets !!!"}
{"text":"We thought it would be a fun girls day lunch. My daughter and my two grand daughters. There isnt' a children's menu so that is mistake number one, and with all the candy everywhere  there isn't a small lollipop in sight. The food was good but it took a bit to long to come out of the kitchen. It definitely is not a place to bring toddlers."}
{"text":"Finally made it to this place and I left disappointed. First of all after sitting for over 15 minutes we had to flag someone down to get service. Everyone kept walking by our table and not once stopped to ask if we wanted to start with drinks or appetizers. I ordered a Turkey burger and fries the burger I didn't really care for, the fries were pretty good. I also ordered a side salad, it barely had any lettuce and had way too many cucumbers in it. The mimosa was decent. I bought a small scoop of ice cream on the way out it was $3.50 kinda expensive since the cup was tiny. This is the type of restaurant you need to visit only once. Way overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Worst service,  food was cold, took forever  for the food. Beer tasted old. Would  not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was warned by my family about the slow Service and they were correct. We had to cancel the desert We ordered because it was taking too  long. Their gobblet drinks are over sensationalized. I would not return."}
{"text":"I say this is something to try at least once. The drinks are pretty strong, but have a lot of sugar in them so it can get you sick. Drink lots of water, you will get dehydrated drinking this mixed with the Las Vegas heat!  Pros: you can get some cute videos and pics from these drinks  Cost: $40 per drink"}
{"text":"Burgers and the milk shakes are the way to go! Justin was a great server , and management truly cares for their guests! We had such a fun time . Such a great ambiance and I love the loud music to drown out my kids excitement over their milkshakes! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because some items are a little too pricy for what they are."}
{"text":"The staff were all very friendly and attentive. Top notch customer service. The goblet was good but pretty overpriced at $39 and really lacking in the alcohol department for the money.   I had high hopes for this place at first, but then our food came out. I ordered a chicken sandwich and after my first bite knew something was wrong. After the bite I inspected my food and the chicken was very very undercooked. They were super apologetic, brought me new food and didn't charge me for my dinner. They also brought us a free dessert, which was appreciated. Again, the service was great. Later that night I got extremely stomach sick though and I know it was from the bite of raw chicken. Can't go back because of that..."}
{"text":"Neat place!  Fun souvenir to bring home to your friends and family with a sweet tooth.  They had a ton of really adorable and unique candies, as well as most of the old standbys.  Prices were pretty reasonable too, considering.  One should note: this is coming off as a restaurant on Yelp, but it's really a store. Some of the reviews are confusing: I don't remember there being any food or alcoholic drinks available here."}
{"text":"We brought our soon to be 7 year old daughter for lunch and dessert. We got the Rainbow sliders, chicken satay and fried ice cream and Oreos.   The sliders were pretty good, she loved the colors and the little duck that comes with it.   The chicken was really tasty and the dessert was awesome!  A big negative was the service.    We were seated right away but then it took quite a while for us to place our order.  To be fair our waitress was nice but clearly overwhelmed with too many tables.  Was a neat experience but with all the cool places in Vegas not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I thought it was an okay place to eat at while on the strip. It is near the Fashion Show mall. Customer service was okay. However this place is all hype nothing really special besides the alcohol."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful inside, however the lighting, the staff, the music all Suck! Our waiter was like a used car salesman trying to get us to buy things we didn't want.  Huge letdown"}
{"text":"Haaaay there. LONG time Sugar Factory fanatic here. Est 2011 when I wasn't of drinking age yet but dreamed of the day I could have a goblet. Being a SoCal native I frequented the location at the Paris Hotel often and my heart broke into a million pieces when I had seen that it closed down. Fast forward and here we are! You could not fathom my excitement as I heard this place was opening during a trip to the SF @ the miracle mile shops. Did not have as much time in Vegas this time around as I had hoped so I only got to visit once and it was a weekday. NOW with all that being let's get down to it.  Being a weekday it was not super busy but had a decent amount of people. We were seated immediately and given menus. I got my smoking goblet! (amazing) Seriously anyone whining about the price can get bent. You're paying for the brand, you get quality liquor, and great visual effects perfect for showing off to everyone on social media. DON'T COME TO VEGAS BROKE!?ANYWAY. My guy was happy you kept the pizza burger ( from the OG menu )  he loves it and talks about how he craves it and can't wait to go back. You axed my monte christo sandwich soooo I got savory crepes which were good. I couldn't really describe anyone here as friendly - maybe mildly pleasant? Our server was okay, nothing to write home about. He could have checked on us as we did have to flag him a couple times for refills. Unfortunately after the meal is where it really went downhill (please bare with me)   Being obsessed with all things Sugar Factory I wanted the whole experience and really missed the chocolate lounge. Our server informed us they had just opened for today and we were welcome to go up and we could order dessert upstairs. Well once up there the magic kind of died. It was empty (to be expected) and this blonde bartender gave us the evil eye (yikes) I felt horrible like I had walked into someone's house. I VERY nicely apologized for bothering her and asked if we could order dessert up here. She kind of huffed and said \"yeah it's fine but what they wouldn't give you dessert downstairs?\" Ughhh I felt so uncomfortable... I told her I wanted the full experience yada yada and took a menu. Menu is great and I really wanted to relive my 18th birthday during my first visit to SF years ago with my mom when we had the chocolate fondue. But we literally just sat here. For an hour. I'm not exaggerating I promise. If I wasn't so hell bent on holding onto \"the magic\" of this place we could've walked out. We both felt crappy to bother this clearly unhappy lady that had disappeared and left us up there alone. We had to chase after her a few times and she finally took our order. We waited about another 30 minutes after this. In the meantime we heard her talking with a coworker that came up saying that she was all alone AGAIN today and basically she was understaffed and outwardly very unhappy about whoever called out or whatever. I guess that's why she was so unhappy? Well the same waiter from downstairs brought our chocolate fondue out . The chocolate was lukewarm borderline cold (idk how that's even possible). I enjoyed it for the most part I mean chocolate is good no matter what I just wish it had been warmed at least? Well it was time to go . We payed and left and I'm happy I payed extra to keep my goblet .   *** IDK who took the time to read this but management/owner/ANYONE that has the power to do something***  Please listen to the reviews and find yourselves some solid workers who are professional and NICE. You guys NEED to restaff! And find more kids to hand out flyers?? There was some awkward dude y'all are paying to literally stand and walk in circles.. I guess he was supposed to be advertising ladies night but he was so uncomfortable trying to approach people that he just stood around.  I want to make it clear that I did NOT have a five star experience but I do NOT want to see this place fail. There is so much potential but you have GOT to improve in your service department. Atmosphere, cleanliness, price it's all good in the hood but your lackluster staff is KILLING you."}
{"text":"Update. Manager verified we did not get charged twice but never refunded for the salmon. Fun experience and decent food. But very disappointed in the fact that we substituted shrimp for salmon on my wives salad and we were charged for both. Even after questioning it. Fun and good food but not worth it."}
{"text":"The goblet drinks looked awesome but I decided to pass on this and get one of the insane milkshakes instead. They're pretty insane! I had the Twinkie Dinkie and it comes complete with a Twinkie garnish. The glass comes covered in chocolate and gum balls, and the chocolate is worth scraping off and eating with the shake. As for the food... I don't really have much to say because it was so average. Definitely check out this place for dessert or a drink when you're ready to spend a lot for a great photo or just an over-the-top indulgence, but I suggest passing on  having a regular meal here. As for the prices... well expect to pay a LOT for what you're getting but check the Yelp or other promo deals."}
{"text":"I don't really remember being here, but one drink tasted like a jolly rancher and one was like a tootsie roll.   AhhhhMazing!   And the Britney Couture Pops, so cute!"}
{"text":"5 star night for sure! My sister in law and I love sugar factory, since she is a local, every time I visit we usually designate a night out to go to the location in Paris...not anymore! After our experience at town square I doubt we'll go anywhere else. I am in no way comparing to be rude, I am only doing so because I think its valuable info. The food was definitely better tasting, we had the chicken tenders (our favorite), puff pastry brie, and they brought out complimentary popcorn shrimp which we hadn't ever tried and ended up LOVING! Our main course was the Fettuccini Alfredo with shrimp which was also good, the cheese bread that came with it was incredible! I had the lollipop passion goblet and had the best buzz ever. At Paris, we had a goblet each and a martini after and left barely buzzing. The bartender at town square definitely hooked us up, he even teamed up with our waitress to make our night great by bringing us rounds of watermelon (Jolly) shots, on the house! I don't know about you, but service definitely determines my return to anywhere that I visit and the attentive staff at this location really made our night. Britney was helping us and she was such a sweetheart, made us laugh and seriously made our night! The manager at the location, I'm so sad I forgot his name was also really awesome, we got there kind of late and he lagged the kitchen to make sure we didn't eat in a hurry. He also checked up on us during the meal to make sure everything was wonderful, so awesome! Overall, loved everything about this location. The music was up to date and fun, drinks were strong but yummy, food was delicious, and our nutella dessert and smores martinis sealed the deal! Can't wait to visit again!! :D  PS. Floyd Mayweather was having a party at this location the night that we were there and according to the staff, celebs visit this location all the time (just an added bonus) haha"}
{"text":"Went there with some friends for a bday party.  Sat at the bar for a few mins and no one came to see what we wanted so we sat at the table. Waited 15 mins before our server came to get our drink order.  Then it was another 10 - 15 mins before we received the drinks.  It was over an hour since we sat down and I had to ask our waitress if we could order food.  Ordered a few appetizers and the club sandwich....the fries were cold and soggy like they were sitting for quite a while.  My friend ordered a well done burger...specifically said to burn it and it came out medium. Another friend ordered the chinese chicken salad and it didnt have any dressing on it. We ordered 3 of the goblets and couldnt taste the alcohol....pretty sure it was just fruit punch or whatever sugary beverage they keep on hand with no alcohol whatsoever.   The ladies bathrooms were a whole other story. There were no toilet seat covers in any of the stalls, no paper towels and very little toilet paper. It was horrible....it was like a public park restroom. 2 out of the 3 stalls were unuseable due to clogged toilets....the only one that wasnt was the handicapped stall.The kicker is there was a waitress in the bathroom and she didnt even tell management that the restroom needed to be attended to. Will never go here again and will not recommend this place to friends. Wonder if the Paris Hotel location is any better????"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate my 11 year old son's birthday last night and it was ok. I purchased a Groupon for $55 which had an $80 value. The coupon said it was for 4 or more people. Great!   We get to the location and after being seated it was cool. We were greeted promptly and our servers were super friendly. The place itself was very cute. There were 4 of us and we ordered: 2 milk shakes, 1 Goblet drink and 1 martini with grey goose vodka instead of the standard vodka, an order of French fries and an order of spinach dip. The bill came and it was $117! I wouldn't even mind the price because the goblet drink was cute and really good and I liked the atmosphere BUT, one of the shakes was not good so one of the kids didn't drink it. The martini wasn't sweet and it was a Lemon drop, and the food was soooo bland.   The staff was very sweet though. I think our waiters name was Mellz (sorry if I butchered that) and he made my son's night with his dancing and just being relatable.   If you're hungry, eat first then come here for your drinks and sweets."}
{"text":"We went back to the Sugar Factory and had a completely different experience this time. Our waiter was incredible and so was the food. We really enjoyed it this time and will definitely come back to this location! Thank you Sugar Factory for changing our opinion, it showed you really care about your customers which is a rare find!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation on Thursday, April 20th to see the Backstreet Boys. I was early and able to see them on the carpet but was told by the hosts outside that the restaurant was closed down and we weren't able to be seated, even though it was past our reservation time, which was included in the \"closed time\". One hostess kept saying \"I don't know what's going on\" to everyone that asked. I sat outside at Starbucks and watched fans taking photos with them right next to me, while I was supposed to be in there. Yes I'm bitter lol. One young woman was helpful (seemed to be the only host who knew things, took charge), she felt bad and found us our table inside, but just in time for them to leave. Well it sucks we weren't allowed into what we had reserved, but we're already here, might as well eat. The music was as loud as a club, and maybe 6 or 7 times that a song came on, was changed to another, like the music is hooked to someone's phone who keeps pressing skip. It was annoying at first but became hilarious when we started betting on how long a song would last. When in Vegas... So just when we're done laughing about that, the lights were dimming and going back up. Over and over. Ambiance, just kidding, bright. Tables nearby exchanged looks with us like \"what the hell is going on?\". The most unorganized place I have ever been. Our server's name was Rhea. She forgot about our table for about 20 minutes, TWICE, our appetizer came out at the same time as our meal, she did apologize for it being \"crazy\" and I can understand that, but eventually another man named Jason had to step in since she was so MIA and he was very helpful and quick on his feet. I wish I would have thought to tip him. I don't care who has an appearance, we will not be coming back here. It's not ok that I had a reservation but was held outside my event. I wish I could say the dining \"experience\" made up for it, or at least didn't make it worse. I don't write reviews unless I feel that a place really deserves a great one and I can compliment someone, or the exact opposite, so here we are. I cannot use another word to describe the Sugar Factory except simply ridiculous. At least we got a few laughs."}
{"text":"I just went to this Sugar Factory location, we had the greatest service from Misti and we have been to a bunch of locations. She was very helpful with our hangover in a fish bowl. Berry was a good choice. Food tasted fresh and came out in perfect time and temperature. White pizza was one of the best I've had and my wife's alfredo was tasty as well. I will definitely be back to this location managers were also great and willing to help with servers tables as well. Nice to see a restaurant having their S*** together! Great place for nice date night."}
{"text":"We came here because I had a friend visiting from out of town and it was her choice.  i didn't know what to expect, since I hadn't heard too much about it before.  I went on Yelp first to read reviews.  It looked like service was questionable, really just depends on who you got. The food received pretty good reviews, so I decided to roll the dice.    It's a beautiful restaurant at first glance.  Looks just like the pictures online.  They were pretty courteous when we first walked in.  She gave us a booth in the back right.    We started with the...  Mac and Cheese Pops: Mac and Cheese fried in what I can only describe as Corn Dog batter, stuck at the end of the stick.  These were actually pretty tasty, despite my earlier description.  Don't blame me, I go with what I know.  Then off to the main course...  Fried Egg Sandwich: This was supposed to come on an English Muffin, but I asked for a croissant instead.  Served with Canadian Bacon aka Ham, white gravy with huge chunks of sausage, and of course... the piece de resistance.. a fried egg, a little over easy, a little over hard.  Accompanied by it's good ole' friend the french fry.  Up next on the menu...  Chinese Chicken Salad:  Do not be fooled people.  Items in the mirror may appear larger then they are.  There's a picture on this menu that makes this salad look larger then life.  In reality, it's kind of a small salad.. LOL.. None-the-less, it was pretty good.  I would rather have a little of something good, then a whole heap of something bad!  For drinks...  I don't really remember the name of mine, but I think it was a Jolly Rancher Martini.  It was tasty.  Definitely, a lot of sugar in these martinis, but I guess that's why you come to the Sugar Factory.  My friend got 2 drinks, but she cannot remember their names, so I decided to leave them off my review.  Let's just assume that they were tasty and sweet.  At this point, you might be asking yourself... Sounds good so far, why the 2 stars?  And that's a good question.  Nothing I have wrote till now, would justify this low of a rating.  Let me tell you what happened...  Picture it... Sugar Factory, this afternoon, 2014...  Through all this good food, there was one major issue... the black fly in your chardonnay...  our server...   Our server rushed us the whole time.  We had never been there before and we had questions about the menu, that he couldn't answer.  He spent the whole time moving us right along.  Literally, he wanted us to square the bill while we were still eating.  Really Sugar Factory???  Have a little class.  For how much the food is there, I expect to enjoy the experience... a little.  Turns out, there was a shift change coming, and we know... BECAUSE HE TOLD US.   I know the food was tasty, and I would like to say it was worth the money.  But I am a person that values an experience, and my experience here was not that great.  Sorry Sugar Factory.. The next time I'll see you is only if a visiting tourist kidnaps me and forces me to eat sugar... LOL!!"}
{"text":"Worst service experience I've had. They don't split checks, manager offended my friend for making her feel terrible about just having beverages, and the food was beyond sub par. I would go anywhere but here on your visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's 12th birthday with two of his friends, and they absolutely loved the whole concept.  They ordered the Lollipop Passion Goblet drink and decided to take our waiters advice by having them share it (Huge).  Then, after each having the Signature Burger, we ended our meal with the Signature Fondue.  The staff all sang happy birthday with a festive sparkler that made our lunch memorable!  Thank you Sugar Factory and Justin!"}
{"text":"Stay away from this place if you're coming in a group. We spent almost 45 minutes trying to split up the check ourselves because they couldn't split up the check in their machine. The food was mediocre. We waited 30-45 minutes for a flavorless burger and fries. The only cool part about this place is the drinks. $40 just for one of the goblets though.    Update: It's obvious that the managerial staff takes pride in their restaurants. One of the managers reached out to me and completely apologized for the experience and invited us back to the restaurant. This visit last night was 100x better than our first. We constantly had our drinks full, the food came or very quickly, and our waiter, Jason, was just very prompt in general. We got the appetizer platter and the pretty patty burgers. It was all pretty good. And we finished the meal with a fondue that was pretty awesome too."}
{"text":"Thank you to Justin who was a delightful server! His service and personality made our dining experience feel so personal and fun!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and horrible service by the staff and specifically the Manager at this place. We had an unbelievable and very negative experience here last week prompting me to really look forward to this generous one star rating. It would be a big zero if Yelp allowed me to.   The restaurant and retail space is very small compared to the Strip location so don't expect the same experience."}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good and for the price you pay you really will feel full after eating here. The milkshake and cappuccino were also yummy! Sadly we had a small issue getting cell service for a Groupon offer to be marked as redeemed and the server was very unprofessional about the whole situation.... which was resolved soon after. However it ruined the great experience I was having up to that point.   Overall great food and drink, but unfortunately had bad luck with the quality of service and won't be visiting again anytime soon because of that."}
{"text":"Service here was wonderful. Rebecca was our server, and she was sweet and very accommodating.   I had the roasted salmon with asparagus. The skin was crispy, and the fish was excellently cooked. I really enjoyed this dish.   I tried my husband's steak au poivre and frites. It was really flavorful and tasty. He got potato chips with it, and when he asked to get french fries instead, Rebecca gladly obliged and immediately brought the fries.   We got the classic milk chocolate fondue. It was perfect for my husband, myself, and my son.   Next time, I'm definitely sampling more tasty desserts!!!!"}
{"text":"Drinks look cool but the food was not good at all. Food was similar to hospital food. Do famous people really eat here or maybe they only get the candy portion.... anyways don't recommend for food."}
{"text":"We were a little hesitant to go to the Sugar Factory, mostly based on previous reviews about the lack of customer service.  BUT, we were pleasantly surprised!  Our server Anthony was so nice, informative, and attentive.  The salmon was so good, and the cocktails were fun.  A little pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Matt was great ask for him he is really nice and everyone is very friendly. All the food was great and I hope to go back soon. Plus the fries are great too. I went on a Monday and it wasn't that packed so yeah I suggest to go there on a weekday"}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines day lunch. I was surprised to see Sugar Factory at Town Square.  I had their chinese chicken salad. Our waiter was nice enough to get chopsticks from panda express across the way since I asked for chopsticks and they didn't have any... which I thought was nice.  They have a pretty good size menu... I love the ambiance and they have tons of seating. I would love to come back and try more things off the menu. My friend loves the blue cheese burger. I'm a fan - Miss Yelp 2014"}
{"text":"I always see photos in magazines of celebrities eating here and it looked cool so I wanted to come here. I figured it was going to be overpriced and gimmicky with average food, but I still wanted the experience. My husband and I ended up eating a light dinner beforehand and just splitting a goblet drink and a milkshake, which was a good idea cause I don't  know if we could have eaten dinner and our drinks, we were having trouble finishing our drinks alone.   Service was pretty slow even though it wasn't crowded. I was disappointed that they were out of the night owl drink, so we settled on the drake. It had cotton candy on top but it melted when they poured the smoke in it. We also got the dulce de leche milkshake with chocolate and popcorn on the mug. The milkshake was pretty decent. The drink was ok but very sugary. We forced ourselves to eat all the candy in it cause it was so expensive. My husband said he was going to be in diabetic shock and have to get his leg cut off after the meal. They don't even give you a price for the goblet drinks. Luckily we had a yelp offer for 50% off a drink, otherwise it would have been $38. We also had coupons on the table for 50% off food but our waitress was kind of cold and said \"well you can only use one, which one do you want to use?\" She tried to be sneaky, she should have just told us it was better to use it for the drinks. Luckily my husband figured the drink would cost more and said to use it for the drink. The only thing we couldn't finish was the lollipop, our waitress gave us a bag to take it home.   I did like the duck theme of the place, I love ducks. The host outside was very nice and offered to take photos of the both of us sitting on the duck. I wanted to get a sparkly duck shirt but they only had kids sizes. I ended up finding one at sugar factory at the airport.   Overall, we had a fun experience. We got a lot of pictures for snapchat of our bubbling drinks and huge milkshake. I'm glad we went there, but we probably wouldn't return because there's better places to eat."}
{"text":"Way mediocre food, slow and inattentive service - no wonder this place was empty at prime weekend brunch time. That's pretty bad if they can't even fill a restaurant this size with their constant groupon deals. This corner spot seems to be cursed, and Sugar Factory will probably end up closing like all the rest. The strip location is fun and great for groups, this one is so empty it's depressing.  The deal is pretty good - you get $60 for $30 that you can use on food & drinks for 2. It started out kind of crappy - I wanted the Lollipop Passion goblet, their signature drink. But was told that I can't have it because the lollipops cost too much. #1 the drink costs exactly the same as the rest of the goblets, so you're stupid for not pricing it higher than the rest, how is that my fault? #2 it's not stated as exempt in the fine print. and #3 the groupon is basically constantly up so they've had more than enough time to add that detail. It pissed me of on principle. She had to speak to the manager to even get them to say I could order the goblet but without the candy.   Friend thought his pizza burger was decent. The sugar factory eggs benedict was kind of a joke too - yes the description doesn't state that there are english muffins, but isn't that one kind of a given? You know a burger comes on a bun even if it's not mentioned, so wtf. So it's $16 for canadian bacon, potatoes and poached egg with cold slightly congealed hollandaise. YUM!  Weird I also just looked at their website - the drinks are more expensive at the Paris location understandably, but at least the breakfast food is cheaper? And the strip has a classic eggs benny WITH english muffins, while town square doesn't have that option. dumb..."}
{"text":"My wife and I love eating in town square and noticed that sugar factory looked very similar to serendipity off the strip.  We ordered  a virgin passion fruit goblet and boy were we surprised, quite possibly the greatest restaurant style drink we have ever had.  Matt was our waiter and he smiled and joked with us the entire time as if we were lifelong friends.  The macaroni stuffers were amazing and our order of steak and grilled cheese was even better.  We usually eat at much more expensive restaurants but this one really took the cake for the price.  I found myself telling my friends about how amazing their simple grilled cheese and tomato soup was.  My wife's steak was thin so we weren't expecting much but WOW it was amazing.  It had the taste and texture of a good porter house and was well marbled.  Matt was awesome and we look for him each time we go back.    Thanks !"}
{"text":"I am going this Sunday at 3:00pm with a party of 7. I will be celebrating my daughters 8th B-Day. I called the sugar factory and was asking the gentleman who answered the phone a few questions about happy hour and also about parking  just simple questions that way I can better plan on being there. I asked if they did something for a birthday and the guy said \"yes, we sing happy birthday for a 5$ fee only when purchasing a sundae\" I said ok, he seemed annoyed when I called. I really hope that my experience is a lot better there than the experience I had on the phone. I hope the bad reviews helped staff in a more positive way. Pictures and another review on its way!"}
{"text":"If the music is so loud that the server can't hear the order correctly it's probably too loud.  All the fried food was so greasy that you can only assume that the food was fried twice. Our server didn't come back until the end to give us our check; we had to get our mustard and hot sauce from the busboy. And the milkshake was crazy runny. It was more like chocolate milk rather than a shake. Now I have to have another dinner to redeem myself from eating this crappy one. Would NOT go back again.   *Update on 9/12/17*  Since my last review, I got a message from Jennevive (manager) and she apologized for the subpar food and service so therefore kindly offered a free dinner on the house for me and a guest. First of all I didn't expect this kind of response... I didn't think anyone would pay attention to ONE person's bad review. But we went back to give it another chance. I immediately noticed that the music was not as loud as before (I was able to actually hold a conversation while we ate!). I must also mention that Mannie (our server) was excellent to us and treated us like VIP. He was very attentive and kind. The steak and lobster we ordered was supposed to be medium but it came out over cooked, so our server brought us another order of the same and it came out just right. Overall we were impressed with the service both from the manager and server so I did appreciate their efforts to take the time and care for a customer that has had a bad experience. It left me feeling like every customer is important to them and I was appreciative and impressed with that!"}
{"text":"Would rate the service if we had gotten any... Walked in with 3 of my friends and were seated immediately, but were quickly forgotten. Server never came around, NOT even to give us the complimentary water that is usually served as you wait for your order. Waited around 15 mins before we decided to get up and leave. Table in front of us was already complaining to the manager about her server never coming back after taking the order. The table behind us was getting their order taken even though they walked in more than 5 mins after us.  Never going back."}
{"text":"The drinks are awesome best drinks I have had in a long time and the service was great thanks betty"}
{"text":"I really wanted to try their milkshakes and my daughter was excited for them as well.  It took a while to get seated but I yelled out \"table for 6 please\" so the hostess saw we were actually waiting to get seated and not just standing around picking our nose.  15 minutes passed, no \"hi I'll be right with you\", \"hi I'm ur server I'll give u a few minutes \".... NOTHING!  I was looking around and NOTHING!  A few busy looking servers and a few other people with white shirts talking on their walkie talkie ear pieces... but no one to serve us or greet us.  So I got up with frustration and left.  I read about the horrible service but didn't think we'd be a victim of it too.  I saw a few other angry faces looking around for their servers as well and thought to myself , if it's taking this long to get greeted and others aren't looking too happy, what more getting a milkshake!?!  On our way out is when someone finally took notice and asked if something was wrong.... I gave them the same treatment and said NOTHING.  Seriously, service needs a tune up!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience with my fiancé here! Our severs  Ariel and Asher were  super friendly the food was great and so was the service! I'll definitely be coming back! Thanks sugar factory!"}
{"text":"Sugar is a cool concept but it is way too overpriced! It's $39 for a goblet. Me and my 2 friends split one and we didn't feel anything after. The customer service is really great though, they check on you often to make sure everything is good and the outside area is super cute! I think this is a one time thing, I felt like I needed to experience it but I probably wouldn't go back here."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying Justin was awesome. (5 stars for him). My experience here was really weird this time. So we were a party of 3 & got seated almost immediately which was great. Our server comes by and says he will be right back with waters, ok cool. Didn't introduce himself at all which was odd he has a hideous \"B\" tattoo'd on his forearm though but ok we didn't make a big deal out of it. When he comes back to take our orders we started noticing that he had a bad attitude by the way he slouched over our table to take our orders. So we just ordered a few appetizers & 2 goblets. Our food came out before our goblets & our server was no where to be found. We waited about 10 mins before I had to personally go up to the bar & ask if we we're going to get our drinks or if they had forgotten about us bartender apologized & got our drink to us 5 minutes later. So our server wasn't even checking up on us so I had to ask a different server for everything that we needed which was really annoying because I used to serve & know it's annoying when you have to pick up someone else's slack, so Justin was the server who kept coming to check on us which we really appreciated since our first server was a total flop. If you're just having a bad day don't take it out on the customers because then you'll just get bad reviews like this one oh well, but justin was awesome thank you justin."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Cheap quality food over priced. They don't even have a prep chef so everything's comes frozen or ready to serve and they charge you way more. Our waiter told us because we asked for vegetables a certain way and he let us know that they came cut and pre-packaged so we would be able to get them the way we wanted."}
{"text":"The menu of shakes looks amazing and the drinks at the next table very dramatic. I was there mid afternoon and it wasn't very full so the kind waiter let me sit in his section. I just wanted to order two scoops of ice cream and that's maybe more of a take out item. Which is my only suggestion. I think a few menu items that are smaller would be awesome. The restaurant is very pretty. It leans to playful-elegant in design. The ice cream was very good and at least a half dozen staff members said hello. I will go again for sure. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"After seeing the goblets I knew I had to make a stop here on my latest Vegas trip. My friends and I decided it would be a great idea to come here before going out to the club (it was not a good idea lol). The menus have pricing for pretty much everything except the goblets which is annoying. If you check in on yelp you get 1/2 off a goblet but you can only use one yelp check in offer per table. I believe the goblets are $32-38? I can't remember but our final bill was insane. We ordered food too which I would recommend skipping. I ordered the fried macaroni balls which were good but for $13 not really worth it. Overall the goblet was cool but as you can tell it's a lot of sugar and not a lot of alcohol. I did like the decor and everything inside was really awesome but I don't feel the need to come back."}
{"text":"My first experience here last night with friends. I didn't eat, but friends did. Food looked good, but there was a problem with the staff & the service. We ended up with the manager serving us as our order was all messed up. In the end, they comped us the meal & drinks, which was very nice of them. Will have to try again once they've been up and running a while longer."}
{"text":"We came here for my nieces 13 birthday. The food was decent and the drinks were fun and delicious. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because they don't list the price of the drinks. I guess I should have asked but when we ordered 3 drinks it would have been nice for someone to mention that they were $40-$50 a drink. It was overpriced for what we got. I could go somewhere else and have a comparable meal for substantially less. It was a great experience but I won't go back. The ambiance is fun, and our waitress was great! I just can't get over the price."}
{"text":"I looked very much forward to sampling offerings here, but the visit itself yielded mixed results.    The ambiance was colorful, loud, lively, and bright--until lights were seriously dimmed for the night service. French Onion Soup was only okay, with a minimal amount of cheese and broth that tasted like Lipton's boxed onion soup.  To the contrary, the three meatballs covered with Marinara Sauce were very good as a featured appetizer, and Diane's trio of Fred Macaroni & Cheese Pops were nicely filled with gooey Mac 'n Cheese.  The Tomato Soup that accompanied her Grilled Cheese Sandwich was also creamy and delicious, although the sandwich itself stuck to the bread, was too dry, and the two slices were clumsily and unevenly joined.  While the soups and appetizers came out quickly, there was over a 45-minute wait for our entrees.  My party of three sat and sat while we watched other diners be seated after us, receive all of their food, and leave.  Our server said that our entrees would be coming shortly, but never admitted that a snafu had occurred in the kitchen.  This was very evident when I was presented with a bill for double what we had ordered in salads and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.  This was promptly corrected by our server, who then acknowledged that our entree orders were rung up twice (for unknown reasons).  At least the Chicken Salad with Ginger Dressing was abundant, moist, and very good; the hand-cut French Fries excellent; and my sip of Diane's Chocolate Cookie Jar Insane Milkshake through a thick green straw, with the taste of caramel coming through the chocolate, simply outstanding."}
{"text":"First off, this place is just way over priced. It's def just for taking pictures and putting it on your social media. The decor is gorgeous and fun, reminds me of some of the bakery shops in Paris. The big bowl drink I got here is $38 without tax and tip, including with tax and tip I spent about $10. Total $48 for this drink. It was really good and def a fun experience buuuuut it's def my last because it is not worth $48 to me. You could go on Groupon to help with the price. I found a coupon for $24 and you get a $40 certificate which could help a lot. I haven't tried their food or shakes which I'll be coming back again because it looks delicious as well!  They open from 11am to 11pm."}
{"text":"Cocktails were excellent, and dinner was delicious. But DANNY made our evening exceptional."}
{"text":"One pound of candy for $17, SERIOUSLY?? I'm not a huge candy person...well it depends, but ya...$17 though?? Thank goodness I had a myVegas reward for \"buy one, get one free one pound.\" The workers there are nice, but ya...not wasting money here unless, I'm getting less than one pound, MAYBE."}
{"text":"For being on the strip. They have horrible service. Our waiter Chaz, clearly didn't want to be there's, which is clearly why he didn't get a tip. He was rude and barley came by the table. He asked, do you guys want desert, and we said, not yet, and replied, okay good. ... The food is mediocre at best. It's expensive, but for no reason. It's not out of this world. I could make it better and cheaper myself. Save your time and money. The dessert is blan, nothing special."}
{"text":"So now that my mind is clear and I'm not pissed off anymore. Let me revise this review.  John and Corey both reached out to me via Yelp, which I appreciate.  John was able to refund all the extra charges, YAY!  So in all honestly, this restaurant is OVER - priced but that's all restaurants on the strip. Their Signature Burger is good, juicy and flavorful but I can get the same burger at a cheaper price somewhere else. Their goblets and mixed drinks are too sweet for me, but with a placed called Sugar Factory, sugar is what you will get. I felt my mixed drink didn't have enough alcohol, maybe it depends on the bartender, or the person. I'm a lightweight but still thought the drink needed more booze. I was disappointed that they ran out of their rainbow sliders, since that was the whole reason we came. They did make me blue sliders, which will have you pooping green (TMI :)).   Our waitress, eh, she was always MIA. It's still a cute place to bring your kids because they will enjoy it. So hopefully in the future, I'll be able to taste the rainbow sliders (yah, I know it will taste like the blue ones I got, but hey I need that pretty pic for Yelp)!"}
{"text":"Super fun with great food, we've been a few times and tried different dishes, all of them yummy!  From fluffer-nutter milkshakes to Chicken Marsala, we've been impressed with the food and service of this location (the one at Paris had awful service and we won't go back).  Love the quirky decor and the friendly staff."}
{"text":"I normally dont care that much but this place was a terrible experience for me and the other table's around me. The service is bad, there are pleny of employees walking around. The guy directing everyone did nothing but tell the other people where to sit customers coming in meanwhile everyone is sitting and waiting for water or any attention at all from a server.   The servers use some tablet thing to put in the orders so placing your order takes extremely to long. The funny thing is the food came out extermly fast which suggest its not all thay fresh. All in all I,think this place is porrly managed, i could tell my server was doing all he could but not getting the support from management or the resource needed."}
{"text":"Wanted the milkshake and was so pumped for it. The server kept ignoring us and served everyone else but us. We waited for 20 minutes before they took our order and he kept walking back and forth, not even acknowledging us. He even served people who came after us. We are soft-spoken so we waited quietly and just as we were about to walk out he came. It would have been one thing if he said I will be right with you guys. Shake was good service... not so much. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is all about the sweets. I had one of their famous goblets before and saw a groupon for one and had to get it for this time. They accepted the groupon with no troubles.  The food here was good but not amazing. They did have a wide variety on the menu, so if  you're with a group and can't decide where to go, here may be a good place.  I got the goblet with the penguin gummys. I think it was called Penguin Mango Peach. Very tasty.  The waiter was very friendly and I had no trouble with wait time."}
{"text":"There is nothing about this place I didn't like. Its adorable, clean and so delicious! I had such a wonderful time inside this store and its connected to the Paris hotel. Just take a quick wall through the bar in the back it will make you want to pass out for the perfection of chocolate overload smell...AWMAZING. The drinks are so delicious! When I think about Vegas I immediately think about the drinks I had at the restaurant. Almond Joy and Jolly Rancher. The drinks HONESTLY taste like the \"foods\" they are trying to taste like. We also had a Swedish Fish, These drinks are creepers, They will sneak up on you because you don't realize just how much alcohol they have in them!  if your a candy fan GO HERE FOR DRINKS 2 for 1 happy hour and share a fish bowl drink with a friend.. You'll  leave happy! The entire place feels like 3 different places, there is a dark amazing bar that smells like chocolate, a restaurant with a classy bar and an amazing sweet shop"}
{"text":"This particular Sugar Factory is located in the MGM Grand Hotel & Casino and it is a sugar junkie's heaven!  I was a bit overwhelmed the first time I went into the store because there were so many cute and yummy-looking items in there.  There were a lot of bright colors jumping out at me and they had a wide variety of things to choose from.  Sugar Factory is a boutique style candy store and they're known for their lollipops, known as their \"Couture Pops\" and you can customize the stick/handle.  They display pictures of celebrities in their store holding the lollipops.  Overall, the customer service was great and they have a whole bunch of cute candies.  The only drawback for me were the prices.  I spent about $18 for 3 chocolate bars and 2 packs of gum."}
{"text":"I'm so happy they're open!   My boyfriend and I came here for our weekly date. We came because we heard there was a happy hour. From the minute we walked by and we're approached to the minute we left we received great service. Everyone was so friendly and our server was awesome. Lashawna gave us a great experience. We ordered the goblet and with it came a $3 appetizer for happy hour (which you apparently need a promo card for). The goblet we got was called Energy Bear which came with burnetts watermelon vodka, grey goose vodka, and tropical fruits. It has energized gummy bears inside and topped off with a Red Bull. The goblets are filled with dry ice and they come and bring the drink mixture in a cup and the server pours it in your cup and it pretty much smokes up. We chose wings for the appetizer. Delicious Buffalo wings!!! We got The Farm burger which has an egg on top and gravy with angus beef, and comes with fries. To finish, we had the brownie ice cream sandwich for dessert and that too was amazing.  Overall, a great experience thanks to our server. Expect it to be pricey, but it's worth it. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and it will be my last. This place needs a new manager. The majority of the staff is not properly trained as the service was substandard.  When I called to ask exactly where in the Fashion Show Mall this is at, the lady on the phone was very nonchalant. Additionally, the hostess was worse; didn't even properly greet us.   There was only one server for an entire section and many customers were complaining how long everything took.  Do not order the burgers! The menu says \"grass-fed burgers\" and they cost $19. But I can tell they were frozen patties and they were dry. Go to Wendy's if you want a juicier burger. Everyone at my table agreed about the dry $19 burgers.  The premier milkshakes are what they are known for. So for $19 each, it is worth the price. However overall for you money, the untrained staff, and also how their air conditioning did not work in the middle of the summer, I will not come back."}
{"text":"If you fancy sweets and enjoy drinks with candy in it, you'll love this place. They have a restaurant, bar and a candy shop.   I've always been a fan of Sugar Factory's ostentatious interior. Striped black and white chairs, red booth seating and beautiful crystal chandeliers on the ceiling. They dimmed the lights around 7:30 pm and blast the music, I felt like I was in a club. The people that were coming in were big loud parties. I was hoping for a quiet intimate dining with my husband.  Our waiter Manny was accommodating. Our food and drinks all came in on good timing. I checked in on Yelp and received a %50 of a goblet. We enjoyed the watermelon goblet and hoped that the second one would be the same but it had more alcohol in it. One goblet was enough to put me and my husband on a good buzz and was enough to send us home and call it a night.   For our appetizers we ordered a sampler, everything was delicious and for entries my husband and I both ordered a NY steak. My steak was a bit salty, husband said his steak was delicious.  This was our second time eating at Sugar Factory. Thank you for our full bellies, good buzz and great time."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews that I've read on Yelp, I wasn't expecting so much from this place.  My husband and I had reservations, this place didn't start to get busy until after we were seated. We sat inside, they also offer a nice little seating arrangement outside if you want, but I like the a/c.  I liked their white and silver interior with their cute chandelier that hung from every booth section inside the restaurant. It was interesting to see how they've remodeled this place since the last time that I've been here when it used to be a Hookah Lounge/Night Club club 3-4 years ago.  They played modern music and played 50 cents song \"It's your birthday\" to people who celebrate their birthdays. The crowd were from early 20's to 30 something's, so fortunately, my husband and I still felt like we belonged; being in our very early 30's and all.  Our server, Tammy was great. Tammy made sure our food was delicious and made sure our drinks were full.   Since my husband and I aren't huge drinkers, we decided to share a Goblet together, which is a really huge drink you can share for 2. We went for their 'fish bowl' which was really good, it took us awhile to finish it.  I had their Chicken Marsala with mushroom, which was absolutely ambrosial, since I love chicken and mushroom. The noodles were done well, the chicken was nice and soft and the  mushrooms wrapped up the dish. Loved it.   My husband had their Buffalo Chicken sandwich, which he claims was \"really good\" with a side of their \"really good\" fries as well.  We skipped out on dessert since we were pretty full and had our one year old wedding cake that was waiting for us at home.   Our over all experience was pretty good, the food prices aren't that bad at all, the only thing pricey are the drinks, they have happy hour Mon-Fri 3pm to close. We used our Groupon coupon and had a really good deal, our bill came out to only $4. We plan on coming back for happy hour to try their desserts and cocktails.  The only bad thing I can say about this place is that we were ignored by other servers when we tried to get their attention, they appeared to be stuck on their task, one task; setting up tables.  The women's restroom needed cleaning in the stalls and the trash cans were full and needed to be emptied out."}
{"text":"This review is for the lounge. We Waited 40+ for food and we were the only people there.   It came ICE cold and was not good at all.  They also didn't have a lot of things on the menu available and I signed the check and then realized they charged me almost 20$ more.   Update: 2 out of 3 of us got food poisoning.  And they charged me 20 over what I spent even tho they said they wouldn't.   I ended up disputing the extra 20 through my bank.   Edit: I got a message from the manager and in this message i responded to all 3 of us got ill but they wanted the full truth because in the previous review, I wrote 2 out of 3 got sick. I only said 2 because the 3rd person just had an upset stomach and I didn't want to be dramatic who got sick, so to be \"TRUTHFUL\" 2 of us had vomiting and diarrhea and the 3rd was just nauseous.  UPDATE: careful if you post an honest negative review. They will threaten you."}
{"text":"Our server Joe was great. Very accommodating and recommended choices tasted great. I had the tuna melt and my husband had turkey burger. I ordered the sexual  chocolate and my husband ordered the peace love and harmony. Great eatery. Will come back again."}
{"text":"I ended up with a Groupon for this place because I needed to use a credit I had and figured it was a safe bet. They recently opened and service was great. We were checked on by no less than four people, Including the manager, while we dined.   I decided to order the club and my mom ordered the tuna melt. Both were served with fries and came out quickly. The sandwiches were basic. The bread was a little dry but the sandwich was tasty. The fries were a bit under seasoned, but I didn't mind since I prefer them to be under seasoned than overly salted.   We had intended on getting a dessert to share but our portions were such that we were full by the time it wad time to decide on a dessert. We might have been a little more inclined to order dessert as well if anything was under $9.   We enjoyed our meal her, but it's nothing special. Come for dessert, that's mostly what they are known for. Just keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"The wait staff and manager was very polite and accommodating.  The view from the patio overlooking the strip is a great place to hang out and chill while people watching."}
{"text":"Food: 3 Decor: 5 Service: 3 Price: 2   Tried Sugar Factory for the first time on my boyfriend's birthday. Upon arrival, I asked for a booth.  The hostess said they didn't have any (I spotted 4 open booths and 1 being cleaned). I think she was too lazy to pick up the menus and move them to the booth 5 yards away. But anyways, decor inside was very nice. To start, my boyfriend order a goblet. That was cool, but way too big for us to finish. It's definitely made for like 4 people, unless you're trying to get hammered. Haha. The food was overpriced. VERY overpriced. I don't mind spending $15 on a burger, if it's bigger than a $3 fast food burger, but it wasn't. The portions were TINY for the price. The service was decent, but their WiFi wasn't working, and there was no service inside. Had to walk outside to load the groupon on my phone. Kinda annoying. Overall, if I go back, I'd probably go just for their overpriced, but cool, drinks and maybe an appitizer or something."}
{"text":"I'd been looking so forward to coming here and ended up pretty disappointed. We ate and had a drink to share. The food was overpriced, average quality, and a very small portion. We asked what the least sweet drink was, because neither of us were looking for a super sugary drink (which maybe was our big mistake), I can't remember what the name of the drink was they recommended, but it was super sugary and didn't seem to even have alcohol in it though it was supposed to. All in all it was a fun photo opportunity but I would never return."}
{"text":"This place was so much fun. They have amazing cocktails that are unique and delicious. The food was fantastic. We're too full for dessert but those look great, too. We'll be back again with the kids - they'll love it."}
{"text":"So I love this place every time we come to Vegas I alway come to this restaurant ( the past time was at the different location) this is my first time at the new location. We came on a Thursday night to celebrate my husband birthday. The wait was 1h and 30 but they will tell us just 10 min every time we will go ask . Finally they sat us at our table the was in a corner by the bar . The most uncomfortable chairs ever . We didn't get a waitress till I said something or else we probably would be sitting there for ever with out anyone serving us . Finally we get help and they start bringing the food my husband order the fish tacos appetizer omg the worst ever no flavor with tortillas that look like Guerrero from the grocery store. I feel bad for the staff they really need new management the service is just horrible and the food is definitely not like it use to be . It sucks but I definitely won't be coming back ."}
{"text":"The service was ABSOLUTELY horrible! The waitress took forever to get back to my girlfriend on how they made the caesar salad vegan and then proceeded to get 50% of our orders wrong. The majority of us got burgers so there is no excuse for the poor service. Waitress blamed the runner, manager blamed the cooks/kitchen staff, and we still didn't get an apology. We were there for a friend's birthday party and I would have expected better service. The manager didn't even offer up an apology to us so I will probably never go back. She just said that the restaurant had been open for a month and thanked us for our patience while they sort through the mess. My friend was very specific in saying that she wanted no cheese on her chocolate burger and within a minute to 90 seconds, the waitress brought out one and asked her if she wanted it with cheese on it. She was beyond livid and so was her boyfriend."}
