{"text":"had a  buy one get one free coupon so gave their bbq a try.  They claim to smoke all of their meats, and this may be true, but we could tell they boiled the ribs before putting them on the grill.  They had water in the meat and were softer than a truly smoked meat.  Brisket was very fatty and could not eat.  Pulled Pork and Chicken were good, though.  The burgers we saw coming by our table looked really good so will go back and try them.  Nice quiet atmosphere with big, nice TVs."}
{"text":"First brisket sandwich to go was good nice bun toasted good salad. Second time i ordered not as good not as much meat bun was not as good salad was not the same it was less. I tried to order by phone third time. Called 5 times between 1 30 and 2 no answer sunday.  Three of the other people went somewhere else.. I drove over, 10 min drive to pick up order. they told the guy next to me they were out of wings 2 30 on a sunday. Got my order brisket sandwich hamburger bun ( Frys 8 for a dollar, more croutons than salad, the topper no bbq squce..Meat was average at best. stopped by after work to complain. got a manager I guess. Would not look me in the eye and told me they run out if things. BBq sauce Buns really.To let a sandwich go out with no bbq sauce is like ordering pasta and getting no marinara. Gross lack of attention to detail. This place will not get any more of my money!!!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner and for this being a bbq place, we would not order the bbq again. The pork ribs were not meaty at all and dry. The brisket was okay. The burgers the table next to us looked good, we may try again and get a burger."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket sandwich. It was pretty good. The bun was fresh and toasted. Bbq was ok, has a kick to it. Came with a large order of fries. They also have a wide variety of beers. 

There are multiple tv's in the bar and 4 large projector screens that can be seen anywhere in the restaurant. The bathrooms were also very clean.

I'd say the worst part of the experience was the service. Which wasn't terrible but certainly wasn't warm and inviting."}
{"text":"Tried this place today. No one to greet me at the bar. The place was almost empty.
Sat at the bar. Bartender was pleasant. Ordered iced tea and a menu.  Menu was paper stapled together with grease prints on it.  Ordered two meat combo; Brisket and Pulled-Pork.  Sides were Mac-And-Cheese and BBQ beans.  Beans and Brisket were very good!  I would pass on the MAC and pork.  Pork was dry and not flavorful.
Mac and cheese was bland. I will come back again and see what else is good."}
{"text":"No, just no.

First of all, we arrived and sat for a full 20 minutes before our drink order was taken. During this time, the karaoke started up....my gut told me to flee now, but my husband  was starving so we decided to stick it out.

By the way, karaoke singers this close to Leisure World really seem to like Willy Nelson songs. And they don't sing them well. 

So we finally got our drinks (Four Peaks on tap) and we ordered our food. 

Then we waited. And waited. The husband decided to join in the karaoke fun for a song, horribly embarrassing the teenagers at the table, oh, and then we waited some more. 

One hour after we sat down, we finally got our food.

The food was not worth the wait. Husband and teenager both ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs. The ribs were blackened and dried out and tough. The tween ordered the buffalo chicken sliders, they were also dried out and had sad little finger sized portions of chicken on the bun. I got the potato skins with BBQ meat and jalapenos - they were just ok, the meat didn't have much flavor to it. 

The restaurant also smelled of smoke (the tobacco kind, not the meat smoking kind) because people kept coming and going to the outdoor patio, and smoke billowed into the dining room each time they opened the door. 

Avoid at all costs. It's too bad, because we live nearby and we'd like to see something succeed in this space."}
{"text":"First time I ever went to this place for dinner. It is also the last time I will ever go to this place for dinner. They didn't have half of menu items. When the food finally did arrive it came without any of the condiments that are supposed to accompany them. No silverware on the table had to wait for that to be brought to us . My barbecue pulled pork sandwich arrived with no barbecue sauce. The barbecue sauce with finally got to me it was like water. 1 of the people I was dining with said it was probably water down so they wouldn't run out of that too. After several people around us complaining about the service in the food we had asked for manager and that took about 20 minutes before realizing they were out of that too. It was the worst dining experience I've ever had and will never go back again. I had them take my food back as after 1 bite it was awful . When the waitress came to take my food back I told her I would go to McDonald's I get a better sandwich. My advice if you're looking for barbecue this is not the place. I give them a month at most to stay in business at this rate. If I could give them 0 stars I would have. Stay away."}
{"text":"First off, I want to let the readers of this review know, I HARDLY write bad reviews. Went to Chubby Hubby for an outing with friends and was astonished. As far as the appetizers go, we had the chips and salsa and the pork wings.  The chips were so bland and tasteless that we needed to pour salt over them just to have some sort of flavor.  The pork wings on the other hand were actually outstanding. They were juicy, and full of flavor. I then ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, and was disappointed. The bun took up 75% of the sandwich leaving me with barely any chicken.  The waitress was slow and did not seem to care about our experience.  When I started to dig into the fries, I popped one into my mouth only to discover a long HAIR. I was so disgusted that I did not finish my meal, nor did I have any desire to.  I didn't bother to tell the waitress about the hair, and did not feel the need to make a scene at this establishment. I was embarrassed, as were my friends. We will NOT be returning to this place. Word on the street is that this place has closed down multiple times. Wonder why."}
{"text":"I really really tried to love this place,  first time there the food was excellent.  It had nice fresh options and not just a run of the mill bbq place.  Good selection of beers and great TV viewing options for the football or nascar. But the last few times I went the service was just horrible.  Now I'm pretty easy going and open to service being slow (ie understaffed or really busy)  but the last 3 times I've been there I could find no reason for the bad food or the slow drink service.  The last time was a Saturday night, 7 pm and they were out of brisket, ribs,  and turkey.  We waited for an hour for a burger and chicken sliders,  only had one beer cause the 5 waitresses and the one bartender were over worked with the 6 tables.  The table next to us waited 2 hours for steak and crab legs (the special for the night)  and asked 3 times for melted butter.  The waitress said that the kitchen was working on it and having a hard time (really? Struggling with a microwave?)  Yes this location has had its bad restaurants but this is no excuse for poor service.  John the owner is a great cook,  but there is no management that this place desperately needs."}
{"text":"We thought the brisket was good but everything else was pretty bad. The service was really weird too. It was as if no one who worked there had ever served food before. They also have one of those open kitchens, in this case it allows you to see the crap they've messily stored in the back and watch the staff loafing, eating and drinking while you wait for them to bring your meal out. I don't know if it was an odd night there but the other patrons were really pretty \"rough\". I'm not going back. The food wasn't good and I was kind of scared of the people that were hanging out there."}
{"text":"SUCKS!  Save time and go somewhere else..  We came here with a group of seven people for a birthday.  It was after 7 when we arrive and the lights were not on so we thought the place had closed, but after seeing some cars in the parking lot we went in.  The \"host\" if you want to call him that was starting his first day, he had no idea what he was doing and said after 10 minutes of mulling around that he would have to spit up our party,  WHAT??  the place wasn't even busy, so we decided to sit at an open 8 top in the bar just inside the door.  He told us to \"let someone know we were there if we wanted to eat\".  Double WHAT???  isn't that a host job, to let servers know there are people there..  geez..  So after waiting another 5-7 minutes our server came over, she had little to no knowledge about what beers they offered,  after taking our drink order she brought back a few waters that we had ordered.  After another grueling 15 more minutes she still had not come back with our drinks, even though we could see them sitting in the service well she never came back.. ten minutes more.... we left.  we had been inside the building for more than 30 minutes with no drinks much less an order..  will NEVER come back.  No one even cared that we left really, the girl at the front asked us who are server was but no one said boo-shit about our dissatisfaction or the crappy service..  Somebody better get a grip...  No MOD to be found, is this place run by idiots??"}
