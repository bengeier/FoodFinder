{"text":"Wiggity Wiggity Whack - Nelson's Bar & Grill is bringing Hip-Hop Back.  At least every Saturday from 9pm to close, they are.   This spacious bar on 8th Ave SW has two pool tables, 7 VLTs, a giant projection screen TV, and a dance floor.  They've also got a well-stocked jukebox for you \"do-it-yourself-ers\" out there.  It's a clean, affordable lesser known downtown bar that's definitely worth checking out, especially if you don't want to wait in line to get into one of the more trendy clubs.  Busta Move over to Nelson's some Saturday night if you dig on Hip-Hop.   As my lame, early 90's Hip-Hop references probably indicate, it ain't my scene, but if it's yours, I'm sure you'll be well looked after.   If Hip-Hop ain't your bag either, Nelson's also features Open Jam sessions Tuesdays and Saturdays."}
{"text":"No...just no.  Dingy dive that smells like stale beer and looks as dirty as it smells. Sat by the pool table (was waiting for someone), for about a half hour and nobody came to the table to serve me. Guess it was too far from the bar!! It was a blessing in disguise, however because I left and met my other half elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar to be sure. I've been in here on a few occasions, the last of which was to check out a band with a couple of friends.   This time around I found it wasn't as dingey in here as I remembered, but it still has the feeling of grandmas old basement bar, converted to rumpus room, then converted to stoner hangout. Its the round tables, the chairs on wheels, the carpets and lighting all coming together in dive bar perfection. Table service is sporadic, so we opted to get our pints at the bar (they had about 3-4 choices on tap). The bar is small and if it's busy, expect a little wait.   We sat in the back and had an alright view of the stage, I think most of the seating would be decent - though there are some pillars that you might get stuck behind.The music there is usually some kind of metal, this evening was a little of a variety pack with some burlesque between sets. One thing to point out is that the sound quality was not so great while we were there, not sure if it was just a bum night for the sound guy or if it's hard to get it right in the venue.   We didn't have food so I can't comment on that, but one thing I will point out, when going back for a second pint, they sent us back to our table to get our empty glasses so they could refill them. Is that even allowed?...probably in your best interest to just consume more ethanol and sanitize yo self.    It is what it is: a dive bar. And I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"favourite dive bar in the city. my friends and I have been a handful of times for shows and the staff never seem to disappoint. the last time we were there the kitchen had just closed, but as we were sitting down one of the kitchen staff ran out and offered to make us something from the fryer.. Awesome customer service in my option.   We love you lord nelsons :)"}
{"text":"Gross, dingy place.  Bad service, rude bar-tender.  I wouldn't eat here if you paid me.  Clientele are an interesting bunch - great place to people watch I suppose.  Apparently this used to be one of the best places in town to see live bands...it's not anymore. As far as I can tell - they have subscribed to the \"pay to play\" \"Montreal indie model\" where the bands book a show and then bring their friends to fill the place...  This place doesn't book or promote music...it just kinda sits there. Just like it's staff.  Not the best experience I've ever had.  Not gonna go back if I can help it."}
