{"text":"This restaurant gets zero stars on atmosphere and service, but FIVE stars for price to quality ratio. Having eaten here several times, I've never been disappointed with the food. The paneer dishes are excellent and everything else I've had was far superior to other Indian restaurants I've tried (even those in higher price ranges). Amazing that a couple can eat a delicious meal for under 30$!  A true gem of a restaurant for Verdun!"}
{"text":"Delicious food at a good price! So happy a great Indian place is finally back in this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant au décor assez simpliste. Mais reste que les plats qui y sont servis sont d'un délice incomparable. C'est un apportez votre vin et offre des boissons indienne qui encore une fois, sont excellentes. Menu très varié et les prix sont très bien. J'y retourne sans hésitation!   Small restaurant rather simplistic décor. But the dishes that are served are of an incomparable delight. This is a bring your own wine and offers Indian drinks that once again, are excellent. Varied menu and the prices are great. I'll go back no doubt!"}
{"text":"very good Indian restaurant. bring your own wine, love the butter chicken tally. Great nam bread!"}
{"text":"I love the food! Its delicious and well priced! Went last night with some friends who are indian and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but I do find the portions are pretty small for the price when you order take out. I literally had 5 tiny pieces of chicken I'm my butter chicken container. But other than that everything always tastes good"}
{"text":"Food is really great. But the ambiance and service is not the best."}
{"text":"Discovered this place not too long ago. Everything Ive tried so far is really good and prices are really reasonable as well! Thali's are great value too. And its bring your own wine! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place as its close to my house and satisfy my Indian food craving...  try the bindi (okra) masala with freshly made naan! The pick up service is pretty fast. The restaurant decor is a little blend but the delicious spicy food makes up for it!   Service a bit sad and cold, too bad. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"This place is so good it hurts. I usually order the same thing and what's interesting is that the taste is subtly different every time, but in a good way. It's like the recipe is constantly being tinkered with and made better, every time. Great place to eat, they people there are lovely and very welcoming. It's our go to place about once, every 2 weeks or so."}
{"text":"Delicious! Nuanced flavours, unpretentious, surprising and comforting food.  Don't be fooled by the decor. Head in and give it a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Overall I'm really happy we stopped at Palais d'Ajit.  The daal soup was good. Too sour for my own taste though, I wouldn't have it like that every time. But still good.  The vegetable pakoras were excellent, and the dosa really good.  And on top of it all, this restaurant is really cheap! Well go back for sure."}
{"text":"I was craving some Indian food for a while and someone recommended this place - so, here I was. Grabbed the Channa bhatura - which is chickpeas and fried bread - and sweet lassi (which was something I often had on weekends back in India). The food was fresh, good and did the job satisfying my craving. Have I had better? I lived in India, go figure if I have lol. In Montreal though, this is some of the best Indian I've had. I'll definitely come back to try other things, which on peeking at other tables looked good."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price!  Family run business, Ajit and his sister took the time to chat with their clientele and made excellent recommendations. Samosas, lamb dish and chicken curry were done to our taste.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"How lucky am I to be living a few blocks away from this hidden family gem... Amazing dishes.. Everything... I have to stop myself from ordering here on a daily basis.. And you cant beat the price... Do urself a favor and have their Chana Samosa... Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good and at a very affordable price. Service is okay, but when the food is so delicious do you really care? We've had a few veggie options, including paneers in the butter chicken sauce and I can tell you that my boyfriend is already addicted to the place. You can bring your own wine. The gulab jamun aren't the most flavourful I got but the rest is very decent. They also don't have homemade chai tea. If you order to go, call beforehand as it can take 20 min to get your food."}
{"text":"Plat Thali sans légume Riz qui sent la moisissure  Service en anglais seulement Je ne recommande pas ce resto"}
{"text":"The food was very good  but hella spicy so be prepared! The food was decently priced and has perfected quantities.  However the restaurant it self isn't so hot, the waiters and staff weren't very reliable. It is a very noisy restaurant with people lining up inside for takeout. Even with reservations it was cramped and close.  But overall the food was excellent and I would definitely go again ."}
{"text":"Opened a year and a half ago in the middle of French speaking Lasalle (everyone in the restaurant were speaking French) yet the young girl waitress did not even try to speak French?! Another older woman sat in the back near a stove starring at me. Either she was in love or she was spaced out but she never said hello.  I sat at the only 2 seat table there is in the restaurant, my back to the window, facing inwards.  The window seats quickly packed up afterwards, other than those 3 tables only 2 other people were there eating further away. I was alone but surrounded. It warmed me a bit from their air conditioning, during a cold rainy mid October day...they AC this place!  I asked my waitress if she was hot and she said yes. I must agree. I digress. They really have a knack for decorating! (sarcasm) I would gladly exchange some decorating tips for food! Talking about food now. I had the lunch thalli, it consisted of iceberg lettuce and baby carrots but no vinaigrette...crudités (salad?) A nan bread and a thin crispy and spicy one (?name?), vegetables in sauce, a tasteless tandori chicken drum stick, and the main part (drumroll)...3 small pieces of goat in a watery \"sauce\", oh and accompanied with rice too! OMG the amount of carbs in this meal! Not impressed, but at $7 for all this is still way better than most places. Thank you for telling me about the Channa Samosas because that was the best part of the meal! Samosas broken open and covered with a hot and spicy tomatoes and chickpeas sauce. Loved that! The waitress should definitely give her opinion on what she likes best on the menu, because without her timid input I would have left thinking the place was not so good. Next time I will only eat what the waitress likes. I finished my meal with a desert, galum jamun which felt like it was heated in a microwave oven, pipping burning hot. Funny washroom area concept. Not much warmth from either the staff or AC, both needed a little help. The waitress does smile when you make her smile with jokes. Otherwise very serious. Relax people.  Put the music louder and smile! This is suppose to be an enjoyable experience! This is a nice find in the middle of (nowhere). I hope they last.  Looking at all the other reviews, they are well liked."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in the city! Great food at very reasonable prices and you can bring your own wine. The place is a gem."}
{"text":"Been there with my bf couple of weeks ago and was really happy we went in. The food is delicious, the prices are more than reasonable and the service is excellent! We had the lamb vindaloo, the chicken tikka and the chicken Masala with rice, naan, and some appetizers all this for 32$!!! Nothing fancy, amazing food at a fair price."}
{"text":"Un petit endroit sans prétention, dont le décor laisse à désirer, mais qui présente des plats de grande qualité, des plus savoureux. C'était vraiment une belle découverte. Nous n'avions pas de grandes attentes, et nous en sommes sortis vraiment étonnés."}
{"text":"le Palais d'Ajit c'est mon spot pour de la bonne bouffe indienne et bonus, c'est à quelques minutes de chez moi et c'est un Apportez votre vin!   Le \"must\" selon moi est l'agneau tiki maslala... juste à y penser je salive!! Aussi, faut pas manquer d'essayer les samosas et la soupe Dahl. Le poulet au beurre n'est selon moi pas leur force! le Poulet vindaloo est aussi très bon, mais attention, ça brûle... deux fois!  Le seul petit bémol est le service, il n'est pas particulièrement chaleureux (et juste anglophone) comparé à beaucoup d'autres restos indiens, mais leur bouffe est tellement bonne que tout est pardonné!"}
{"text":"Don't expect to have amazing service here or to be seated right away (regardless if you have a reservation or not). Once you've gotten over the frustration of attempting to get a waiters attention to open your bottle of wine and bring some water, the rest is smooth sailing.   The food is freshly made by a family member (I think their mom is the chef) in the kitchen if I am not mistaken. Extremely affordable, BYOW and ohhhhhhh so delectable.  I look forward to my next meal here!"}
{"text":"Looove this place, its been two weeks since i've moved near it and i have already been to it about 4 times... Its a family runned restaurant with great prices but most importantly the most amazing flavours!!!! Whenever someone from out of town comes to visit me it is my go to place! Would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"Hesitated to review because I really don't want people to know about this place... I will never have to search for a staple indian place again. The food is as authentic as it gets in Montreal, portions are generous and the prices are more than fair.  If you don't care about decor and enjoy laughing at Bollywood pop videos while eating magnificent food, this place is for you. BYOB."}
{"text":"Without a doubt,  my favorite Indian restaurant to date. There is a lot of variety, but my favorite dish is the chicken korma. The butter chicken is also fantastic. It is deliciously sweet and kid-friendly because it is not too spicy. For those of you who like to feel the burn, they have plenty of options to choose from, as well. I recommend the Thali for people who are just starting to explore their Asian culinary senses. Also, if you are a naan connoisseur, you need add Palais d'Ajit to your list.  Don't expect any fancy surroundings. It looks like a hole in the wall but you'll be convinced to enter the door when you get a whiff of the food (which can be detected from a block away). The staff are very friendly although sometimes the service is slow. If you don't like to wait, call ahead and take it home!"}
{"text":"Palais d'Ajit is a small Indian restaurant which opened its doors recently at the corner of Verdun St and 3rd Avenue, unremarkable from the outside and the inside, clean but aesthetically bland.   The service was polite. The food was good enough and generally affordable. My husband and I ordered the Vegetarian Thali, and although it wasn't the best Tali I've had in Montreal, it was fair and filling. The Chana Samosa and the Pakora were the best parts of the meal. The tea, an average grade Masala tea judging by its taste, was okay.  Palais d'Ajit isn't bad but it could be better if it adjusted its recipes to match competing Indian restaurants of the same grade, and by adding to their decor to make the experience \"homey\" and authentic.   Noteworthy: I believe that some of the other reviews currently published for this place are not legitimate; be wary of them. Also, the bathrooms are really clean and well taken care of; it's the first time my experience in a bathroom is more memorable to that of the restaurant itself!"}
{"text":"I was traveling from Boston and came across Palais Ajit Indian restaurant while staying in Montreal... this is definitely one of the best Indian food I had outside India... we tried quite a few things Tawa aloo parantha, chicken curry, paneer mugglai.. everything came out perfect .. I wish they open a restaurant in Massachusetts soon.."}
{"text":"Saw this place had recently opened up and being fans of Indian food, we thought we would give it a go. Very glad we did. Very friendly service and authentic, fresh food. Moreover, the price was very reasonable. There are a couple of other Indian restaurants in Verdun, but they tend to be a little overpriced.   Make sure you try the mango chutney and onion bhajis!  Also note this is a bring-your-own establishment and they do carry-out as well."}
{"text":"Have been ordering since they opened! Love the food but servings are decreasing . Sometimes the staff seems a little snotty. I give the food 5 stars but servings and hit and miss staff mood brings it down to 3."}
{"text":"Prices are cheap, portions are huge, and its bring your own wine! On top of that, the food is really good. Cant go wrong!"}
