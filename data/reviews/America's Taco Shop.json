{"text":"Definitely the best carne asada tacos in town. Have recommended this place to several friends and no one has been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was cold and lacked flavor. The heap of pineapple on the al pastor was not appealing.  I would not go back or recommend this place.

Rated 2 stars only because the staff was friendly and the portion sizes are huge for the price."}
{"text":"Okay I am ashamed to admit I eat here at least twice a week, but it's almost justifiable with the lard free beans and fresh ingredients!!!  Though I must say the service can sometimes be questionable, it's WORTH it (and Im a HUGE stickler about service so...)!!  My must have, bean and cheese burrito ADD their famous carne asada with guacamole! And warning: the chips and salsa may be habit forming :)"}
{"text":"HELLOOOOO new cravings....

I love tacos (of all kinds but soft corn is the best)!

My wife went to high school with the manager so she dragged me in for lunch today on our way home from the children's museum. Located on the east side of 7th street in a used to be house. A line to the door usually means it is good and it was! 

We had to take the food togo so I was already thinking that it was going to be sub par. I was so wrong.
I had two asada tacos and a bean and cheese burrito.  The tacos were perfect with the lime and the smokey salsa that came with them. The tortillas were soft but not soggy, the meat was smokey and tender and packed with flavor. The burrito was creamy and rich with melted cheese everywhere and beans that were not too heavy. 

I can't wait to go back... and soon.

Thank you America's for making a no fuss slam dunk taco shop!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service. Something in my burrito tasted off and asked if I could try something else and explained how there was much more hot sauce than I expected cooked into the burrito. The girl at the front (Leidy) looked at me and told me she \"didn't know what to tell me\" and that I should \"look at the menu more carefully and KNOW what I'm ordering next\" and that I would have to pay for something else.. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! You should never have attitude with your customers. That was my first and last time ever eating there. Leidy clearly doesn't value the experience that her managers customers receive."}
{"text":"I have been absolutely satisfied with the food at America's Taco Shop. I spent a couple of nights during their first week sampling the menu... The carne is as good as it gets...The menu is simple and filling, and the staff was/is extremely friendly and warm. I for one cannot wait for the patio to pick up with an evening with chips/salsa (which is AWESOME), a couple of tacos, and a bucket of beers before a Suns/D-Backs game... I am sure when the patio is complete (if they are smart) there will be speakers, some heaters, and good music. I can't say enough about the food... The corn is exceptional and different than anything I have had before. The salsa is fresh and just right. The meat is full of flavors and delicious on all of the items I have had, which is most of them... I was not able to finish off the bean burrito, but it could have been that I was so full from the 2 tacos, carne burro, and quesadilla I had pounded prior to it...I got half way through and was stuffed and at that point nothing was going to taste good...Wait, not true...the flan is excellent and it is making my stomach grumble right now that I don't have a piece to wash down the not so tasty Panda experience I had for lunch out here today... I am rambling now, but I want to post it clear here that America's Taco Shop is easily one of my new favorites in the area and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price with friendly staff and a quaint atmosphere... One more thing, parking can be tricky, but it no worse than the place across the street (That's A Wrap), for those in the neighborhood, you know what I mean...I hope they stay around for a long time because I am just getting my appetite wet with their food!!! And hurry up and get that liquor license!"}
{"text":"Not going back. Every time I go here the food is sub-par. I waited 10 minutes for 1 taco, only to find out it was not even warm.  The place was dead so I don't understand why it took so long for a cold taco. This is my third negative experience at this place. I'm done."}
{"text":"Good menu selection...food is good...service a bit slow...bean burrito the best!"}
{"text":"My first impression was how clean and open the lobby and dining room was! The cashiers in front were very friendly. They were knowledgeable about every question i had pertaining to the menu. They were fast and efficient while i was ordering. I tried the America's corn which completely blew my mind. I also enjoyed (very much) the al pastor tacos. The meat on my tacos were perfectly seasoned and tasted like a sweet & smokey flavor. If you like pineapple then this is a must! I also ordered a side of beans with my meal. These beans are not like your typical refried beans from the Mexican food place around the corner, these beans are smooth and naturally delicious! The melted jack cheese on top made the beans an EXCELLENT side to anything on this menu. I come here for my linch breaks with friends and i call ahead and get a fresh breakfast burrito on my way to work. Fast, fresh, and easy choice for any meal!   and My family LOVES this place! Much better alternative to any other fast food place in Tempe"}
{"text":"Charged me for the wrong amount of food and then did not offer to correct it or compensate me when they brought out more food than I had ordered. Fire ants on the patio - beware. Poor service and mediocre food. I will not be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ate here for the first time, and would have preferred a grilled cheese sandwich. The tacos were flavorless, the guac was flavorless. We were also flavorless. Spent 8 dollars for 4 tacos is a little excessive especially when they were nothing to brag about. And 6 dollars for a small basket of chips and guac! Service was fine considering the girl didn't know what to charge us. The place also smelled like bleach and bathroom cleaner. Not holding my breath that we will return to any of their locations."}
{"text":"I use to love this place...cool vibe...Awesome food and awesome Margaritas.  A while back they no longer were open on Sunday's....sad day, but I moved on.  Went tonight and ordered we were the only customers.  Then 5 groups came in after us leaving our food in the window because there were only 2 employees and very busy making our food cold.  I will give it another shot but it's also sad they no longer carry a liquor License so no more delicious margaritas."}
{"text":"If I could leave negative starts I would. This place was horrible. We walked in and started looking at the menu and asked about breakfast burritos and the lady at the register named Ruby rolled her eyes and pointed with her long acrylics (which shouldn't be worn while handling food) and said um right there with a very rude attitude. When we asked if they have bacon she said no and um I need a name. I don't know if she isn't a morning person or what but she was a horrible customer service rep. My burrito can too 9.50 so I was expecting a pretty good size burrito. When she handed it to me I really thought it was a joke because it was about half the size of Burrito Express $6 burrito. We waited almost 45 min and then asked about the 4th burrito. They said some take longer than others. The guy next to us said I came in after you and got the same thing and already have mine. Bottom line is I will never go back."}
{"text":"Best bean burrito around. The beans and tortilla are amazing! Do yourself a favor and get it America's way with jalapenos. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I have eaten at America's three times. The first two times the food was good, but not fantastic. The third time, I was the only one in the restaurant stopped for a breakfast burrito and I waited 20 minutes to get my food. As I was leaving, I noticed that the counter attendant who had just handed me my burrito was now outback of the restaurant throwing up. Needless to say I will not be going back for the upchucka, err machaca, burrito."}
{"text":"Best taco shop ever. If it wasn't so pricey I would go everyday!"}
{"text":"had a burrito there. it had 1/2 the pork filling that you will find anywhere else.

so its basically a tourist trap in the heart of old town scottsdale trying to rip people off.

better bet would be filebertos."}
{"text":"Who am I fooling, I love this place.  7th Ave location is perfect for take-out on my dinner break at work, and the 7th St location is just right for walking to from my apartment.

When you go there, order:
-Chips and Salsa (spicy, or course) - delicious, and don't be shy about asking for some free refills
-Carne Asada Vampiro
-Pastor Vampiro

Nothing more, nothing less.   This is one of my absolute favorite meals in Phoenix any day of the week.  It also makes for a great hangover cure!

I have been disappointed by the size of the regular burritos, but the Vampiros really are over-the-top good."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times now.  Some of the food is good, most is merely so-so. Given the prices, it should all be great.

Carne asada is the best thing they have to offer. It's much more tender than I've found it at most restaurants, but other recipes have more flavor. Served as a torta with pickled jalapeno slices it's really fantastic. Pastor is okay, but lacks any distinct flavor. Mine was a little chewy. A chicken option would've been nice, but I understand that the restaurant wants to stick to its specialties. I'm glad that there is a lard-free bean burro for those who don't eat red meat or pork.

As for sides and such: Aguas frescas are terrible.  The horchata is chalky and the jamaica is cloyingly sweet. Flan has way too much caramel and no real texture, it isn't creamy and it doesn't have the consistency of a cheese flan either. Tastes like it came from a package. Skip all of these.

Tortas and burros run about $6, drinks and sides are at least $3. I don't think there's any way to justify a $3 bottle of coke, and the portions are pretty small for the prices. The carne torta gets a definite thumbs up, but I can't recommend this place on the basis of one dish."}
{"text":"This is the worst representation of Americas Tacos. My heart hurts for those who try Americas for the first time at the 16th st location. 
First of all, it doesn't have HALF the character the other two locations have. This one looks like a dumb ass Chipotle. However, That's not enough to turn someone off about a place though. What turns me off is the terrible customer service. If you hire a bunch of what seems like 16 year olds because they're cheap you're going to get what you paid for. That they did. Everytime I call to place an order the girls sound bored as hell. When I show up they Look bored as hell. One time I went in there was no one in line and the girls at the register didn't even acknowledge me. Instead they flapped their jaws over whatever pointless crap they talk about. Not even a glance. Whose setting the example for good customer service?? Certainly not the gay Mexican manager. I think he thinks he's being sassy and funny gay but he just sounds like a dick. Looks at me like he'd rather be getting highlights then talking to me. One time I couldn't hear what he said my total was and I handed him the wrong change. He stares at me for a few awkward seconds and then said \"if you don't know the total is on the screen in front of you.\" Well I'm sorry Mr. Sassy you are here everyday and know this shit I DONT. What is so exhausting about saying \"Oh I'm sorry your total is actually..\" The second time he pissed me off I called to place an order (I take two busses to work and I get food here because it's in between each bus) well my first bus was like 15 minutes late and once I got there I said \"Hi, I'm picking up a to go order for Tyler\" Ceaser Malone proceeds to say \" Dude, that order was up 15 minutes ago\" maybe a giggle would have made that remark playful banter but no, no laugh no smirk. This fool was dead serious like you are an idiot this was up earlier. Another time I was waiting for someone to come up to the front and help me and after about 2 annoying minutes a troll comes from the back smacking her jaw together eating something from the back. Shit, just swallow THEN come out. Just gross. 
   Anyways, the service here is comparable to Mcdonalds or Taco Bell. What they do know how to do here is makes soggy quesadilla. What a shame for such a good Phoenix business. Sell outs."}
{"text":"The best tacos al pastor I've had on this side of the border. The prices are slightly higher than they should be, but overall the service great and the food is outstanding. I will be retuning shortly."}
{"text":"Overrated.  Is the al pastor and asada delicious? Yes.  Is it waaay over priced? Yes.  The chips were cold and not very tasty.  The salsas were not memorable.  The corn tortillas they use for the tacos are not half as good as the ones Food City or Ranch Market makes.  They do have a nice selection of beers.  I guess they do so well because their patrons love Mexican food and will pay more to have it served by Non-Mexicans.  I guess if you've never had the real deal before this place is good.  There are many many Mexican restaurants in Phoenix serving much better tacos and burritos for half as much.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Steve and his crew are awesome they're smiling and working together they look like they're having a great time I've come to this location several times and they're always smiling the food is delicious it's fresh they were even able to customize my food to fit my taste I appreciate that as I am somewhat picky they even brought my drink to the table , how considerate is that ? I've been to other locations and this one seems to be the best the food is always delicious on point just the way I like it I love tacos by the way. I would highly recommend this restaurant in the airport to any traveling people who are hungry for some good tacos. thanks again Steve you and your team made my day, even though you were busy you were able to quickly accommodate me like I was your only guest."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had.

And for under $4.

\"Nuff said."}
{"text":"I recommend the al pastor Torta (Mexican sandwich).  The bread is slightly toasted and just the right size to be a full meal. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the corn tortillas they use are not very authentic and it doesn't even seem as if they heat them up completely. It's a little small inside but has a huge outside patio."}
{"text":"Got the steak tacos which were burnt. The sauces they have are tasteless. The gucaomoly tasted funny.   I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Really good burros and chips! I had the carne asada burrito and it was excellent!"}
{"text":"The beans here are delicious, but too bad the bean burrito is the size of a taco bell burrito.  Chips and guacamole are very good, but they should be for 8 dollars."}
{"text":"This is a good fast option for really good tacos, but there are a lot of better places for a taco. I must say however that I do venture over here a few times a year because it's close and consistent. The guac is also awesome.

A-OK is my vote. Definitely good..."}
{"text":"Not even close to authentic.   Carne asada was ok, but no rice, beans, sour cream or cheese in the xl burrito. 

The pastor taco had no flavor,  and for almost  $3 for a taco overpriced.   Do yourself a favor,  go to Chipotle like we did after because we were still hungry."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, but very well executed quick service Mexican food.  I've been told by numerous people that ATS has the best carne asada in the Valley, and I must say that the carne asada burrito did not disappoint.  Very flavorful beef, wonderful spices, fresh pico de gallo, and a warm soft tortilla.  This is very hard to beat in terms of quality and price."}
{"text":"I come here often with a particular group of friends. I always liked their food but once I went paleo I ran out of things to eat here...until recently, when they introduced their amazing chicken. 

Now I order chicken tacos without the taco shell. So it's like chicken in a bowl, with all the sides. And it's delicious!!! 

Their margs are okay but nothing to write home about. Service is always friendly and it's very clean. I go here often and will keep coming. 

Definitely check out happy hour, the prices are better. Although if you get the happy hour tacos they will be smaller, which is kind of dumb and defeats the purpose BUT still. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Long-time fans of the downtown location, we were excited to have one near home as well.  So we stopped by after work for a quick dinner.

The quality of carne asada is constant.  It's fantastic, just as good as the downtown location IMHO.  

We went just a week ago, and they had just opened.  So fresh, in fact that the smell of fresh paint and paint thinner was still fairly strong.  So a negative for now, but I'd imagine with a year of constant grilling and the influx of ASU students in the fall, that minor downside will disappear in no time.  

Highly recommend the America's Favorite for two (if there are two of ya!).  Gives a sample of the taco as well as the burrito along with some chips and delicious salsa.  Only wish you could get a smaller side of guac for less than $5.  But, the guac is tasty, albeit not amazing - but definitely a nice addition to the burrito.  The habanero sauce in the bottles on the table work nicely with it as well.  

I'd say it's 3.5 stars, but with a bit of seasoning and experience, I'd imagine this will be a 4star easy.  

I would also imagine you should take advantage this summer before school gets back in.  I can only imagine how busy this place will be when school is back in session.

BTW, for anyone who's not familiar with America's.  They do one thing and they do it well:  Carne Asada.  Don't expect a wide and varied menu.  You can get carne in a burrito or a taco.  Maybe a quesadilla.  That's all the variety you'll get here and it's alllll you will need!"}
{"text":"A family favorite since America ran them herself. We frequent the one at 16th and Camelback Rd. We might miss the ambience of the original spots but appreciate the location as well as their great food and service. The portrait of America keeps watch of the crew at this location. Our large family always feel welcome--thank you guys! :-)"}
{"text":"To be honest, I had never had heard of this place until I got a coupon for half off a burrito. I ordered online which was pretty convenient. Getting out of the car I caught a scent of something AMAZING but it turned out it was the teriyaki grill next door. Still optimistic.
 
I walked in and the place was dead, understandable given the time I went. The young cashier seemed bored and uninterested. I mean I know its not busy but it wouldn't kill you to show a little bit of enthusiasm when customers walk in.

I got a carne asada burrito with extra guacamole (which I now regret a little bit but I will address that later) and since I had the coupon I decided on the Horchata. When given the \"regular\" burrito, the size was very underwhelming for the price they charge. I have gotten larger size burritos at Filibertos and for considerably cheaper. I was still a bit hungry after I finished it. 

As i was driving home I snuck a taste of the horchata and it was AMAZING. Probably the best I have ever had. It was not of watery consistency like I normally find but this one was thicker and was sweeter. Its almost like they put condensed milk in it. I cant say anything bad about it. Hell, I might come back just for that. 

The burrito was cold. I arrived 3 minutes before the scheduled pick up time and i was shocked that it was sitting in a bag waiting to be picked up. The meat in the carne asada was great, definitely had some smokey flavor to it. Not something that you usually find... definitely a one up on Filibertos. The rest of the burrito was just meh. The guacamole had a salty taste to it and since I got extra, it kind of killed the overall experience for me. 

Overall, the word I can use to describe my experience is Meh. Wasn't terrible but definitely wasnt exciting. It kinda bums me out because my boyfriend is a HUGE burrito fan and I really was hoping to rave about ATS to him. I think if they either increased the size of the burritos or lowered the price I would consider going back."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. there was a big line which had me excited anticipating a yummy taco but the meat was dry and the iced tea tasted funny . The overall experience was just  meh."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I ordered for the first time after learning they had an excellent rating. Sadly to say we were both disappointed! Most expensive lunch I've paid for and received hardly anything. Paid $8 for a small flour tortilla size chicken quesadilla, which barely had a tablespoon of tiny chicken chunks. I will not ever go back nor do I recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Friday, March 5th with my other half. It's certainly a Phoenix vibe - a bit grungy and without any glamour. I had the bean and cheese burrito which was wonderful (thanks previous yelp reviews.) The salsa is excellent. Prices were great! One star loss because the place was a little dirty, but it's expected from downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and burritos. I love the Carne Asada Burrito and you can get a massive one or a normal size too. A bit pricey for tacos (more expensive than Filibertos for sure) but delicious. You can grab a beer there too which is great for after work/class. There are huge lines during lunch when school is in session so beware!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here and got a Carne Asada burrito and chips and salsa the hot salsa is pretty good. I really like the way my burrito was made to order. And there chips seem to be made daily the dining area was very clean over all the restaurant is organized and the a staff is very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Darren the manager & the rest of the staff are great! Always very friendly & helpful! The beans are lard free & taste outstanding!"}
{"text":"America's Taco shop is in a cool little house on 7th St.  I'll make this review short and sweet:  they have some great carne asada, but something is wrong with the tacos...they have lettuce...maybe they have an option to get them with onions and cilantro?  I don't know maybe my taco sense is off, but I am more of a fan of the roadside taco stands with simple good tacos for cheap...like they have at El Gran Taco....tacos de cabeza, de lengua...mmmm, real mexican.

Although I wouldn't drive out of the way to go to this place, I loved the vibe, and I would like to try their ceviche, tostadas, hot dogs and corn.  It all looked fabulous and one couple must have eaten one of everything on the menu... I was jealous.  

Yes, I'd definitely go back, it showed promise...maybe I was too harsh with the lettuce on my tacos.  They were pretty tasty and the salsa was a nice smoky flavor...and I really liked the carne asada. 

I'll see how round two goes....I have good hopes for a successful lunch or dinner here."}
{"text":"Ordered two tacos at $2.69 each. What I got were two street tacos worth $.50. Lousy value. Felt ripped off."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burritos are made of crack.   I guess I like crack."}
{"text":"For the person who wrote the first review, I Feel bad you had a bad experience but you should be understanding it is their opening week there is bound to be mistakes made. I think you should give them another chance. 

With that being said our office experience was great! The staff was all very nice, greeted me and my co-worker when we walked in. They had our call in order all ready with everything in it that was ordered (this is hard for most restaurants that our office place large to go orders for, something is always forgotten). I believe they were fairly priced as well. One thing I have to warn the regular size quesadilla are a little small. I know this because I was not aware of the size and ordered 2 for my co-workers. Since it was my mistake on not asking about the sizing I asked the front desk girl to order 2 more small ones. The manager came up was SUPER nice and did not charge me for the extra 2. 

The food was amazing and got great reviews by everyone in the office! This is no added to our rotation for our lunch. I tell everyone to go and try it! Happy to have this restaurant right next to our office!"}
{"text":"I was out shopping with my 16 year old son, and we decided to stop in and try America's. The delightful young lady behind the counter highly suggested that we try at least one thing with the pastor filling so we ordered the meal for two for $20. That comes with chips and salsa, two burritos, two tacos and two drinks The carne asada was very good...but OMG...the pastor was amazing! We just wished we had ordered the burrito with the pastor and the taco with the carne asada instead of the other way around. The sweet young thing kept checking in on us...we were there at 3 in the afternoon so it was quiet...but gosh, the young girls had just been fawning over us all day! On the way home, I looked at my kiddo and realized he's pretty darn good looking...so maybe that explains all the delightful customer service that day! Anyway, I can understand some of the complaints about it being a little pricey, but I think you are really getting a quality product and that is worth it to me. Plus, I thought the burrito was especially meaty. And as a carnivore I totally appreciate getting my meat on! Cute place, yummy food, fun day out with the teenager. Really, you can't ask for more than that."}
{"text":"Easy ordering online. My order was ready when I arrived. The carne asada is as advertised. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I live right by ATS. RIGHT THERE. I had been there before and wasn't too impressed, but I had to give it another chance based on proximity alone. So I went after being reminded of the joint on abc15. The piece they were featured in made my mouth water so I decided to walk on over. 

I have to admit I am rather picky when it comes to Mexican food. I think most Mexicans are because nothing is going to compare to what Nana used to make us when we were young. Although I am choosy I do have favorite places that can suffice when I need some spice. (Sorry I had to be corny) 

They have signs that say best carne asada in town and I am sorry, but the Charlie's catering cart has better carne asada and they do not charge $3 per Mexican coke. 3 BUCKS! I am no cheap ass but damn. 

If you want to visit and  support small local business (which I totally do) check out ATS. 

If you want something less pricey and arguably more flavorful AZ has TONS of options."}
{"text":"After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.

Overall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."}
{"text":"This gets 2 stars for 2 dolla imports on the cerveza buy other than that the food taste like tacos from America, not Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"Haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but carne asada and pastor were both good.  Best thing on the menu is bean and cheese burrito and their guacamole...."}
{"text":"The beans are bland as cardboard. The onions were uncooked and the salsa was not pica. I recommend taco bell over this place. However the cochata was delicious. Maybe they should rethink their mission and vision."}
{"text":"Super good food, great service, nice clean place.  Happy Hour prices on the weekend are awesome!!  I hope this location stays put, it's super yummy!"}
{"text":"America's Taco shop, I love you!  Your beans are some of the best that I have ever had.  Salsa is great.  Tortillas are delicious as well.  5 stars for your food America's.  I do wish you were a little less expensive.  At first glance, I think the prices are great but i always leave spending twice what I thought it would. . . Maybe it is because the food is just so good!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times always incredible food and friendly staff. Surprisingly a really great spot for drinks (tons of unique margaritas and mixed cocktails). 

Perfect for lunch, dinner, or to start your night with some drinks! Will be making this place a frequent dining location :)"}
{"text":"One of my favorite burrito choices in Phoenix. Good location on 7th. The carne asada burrito add beans is a pretty perfect choice. Their roasted spicy salsa and guacamole is equally tasty. Staff is both friendly and efficient. The parking lot could use some revamp, so hopefully there is a plan for that!"}
{"text":"As the name states its AMERICAS taco shop so they are very Americanized tacos. They are really good but nothing that is going to blow your mind. I was disappointed in the size compared to the price. 

What brought it down 1 complete star is that I didn't see where it said the ingredients of the tacos so my food came out with guacamole and I'm extremely allergic to guacamole so I ended up just giving it to my friend and having to buy more."}
{"text":"I heard they had the best Carne Asada in town so I thought I would stop by and give it a try since I was in the area. The service was great, the staff was extra friendly and helpful. Onto the food; So of course I got the Carne Asada Burrito. With a drink it was around $8, so not expensive. I'm very picky when it comes to Carne Asada, and I found this to be one of the better one's I've had, but it wasn't the best. The tortilla was great, excellent consistency and flavor. The steak was flavorful and had a nice char to it. The guac was smooth and rich, and the pico was zesty. All very good. The size of the burrito was pretty small, but then again I go to Chipotle often and they pack those things. For what I spent, I would rather go to Chipotle just because I can get lunch and dinner out of one of their burrito's or bowls. I know, Chipotle vs. authentic mexican food, it's apple's to orange's; but that's just how I feel. I wouldn't call it the best Carne Asada in town, but I would consider it a close second. Personally I find Filiberto's/Aliberto's/Whoever-berto's to be the best; although I find they aren't the most consistent."}
{"text":"Guys, if you want a meat filled burrito, Do not come here. I ordered the XL burrito and it was all tortilla.  Very disappointed. The manager did not care. unbelievable!  Went to chipoltle instead."}
{"text":"Ok really great carne asada. Glad to see the now have a larger burro was kinda small at first and really needed 2 to try and get full. The price is right food is excellent and not to slow on orders. Must try this place if you like carne asada."}
{"text":"Darling little place! We were in the area one Saturday afternoon, so we stopped in,,,having very picky children I ordered them a plain bean and cheese burrito. Well it was a pretty large burrito, so simple, yet SO good! The beans were nice and creamy and not too overloaded with cheese, simply perfect. I ordered one of their carne asada tacos, which were also very good, a tad small, but very tasty. Their corn on the cob with cotija cheese was so delicious. It was very filling in itself. Their house margarita was ok, I've definitely had better,all in all, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Tacos and Guac Trio are Amazing!  Delicious.  The space itself is nothing fancy, but they have delicious food at good prices."}
{"text":"I can't say that ATS has the best carne asada I've had in Phoenix, but the atmosphere and the patio make for a great evening. What's more, the bean and cheese burrito is pretty fantastic. I've also had their breakfast burrito a few times; you might want to ask for an extra side of salsa.

The best part of ATS -- the staff is friendly and chatty. I was glad they placed a tip jar near the register. 

If you've ever visited Houston, you'll understand what I mean when I compare happy hour at ATS to happy hour at Mission Burrito. The food couldn't be more different, but that atmosphere is quaint and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Tried out America's Taco Shop (ATS), it's ok, not great.  Those who think it is great, have only just begun their journey.  If you continue on your path, you will move on, trust me.

ATS does use skirt steak so score on that one.  Carne asada should be grass fed beef, not beef from corn fed feedlots.  You can taste the difference and ATC fails here.  The beef should be grilled over mesquite, not natural gas, so fail again.  Tortillas should be made fresh, not factory made, so fail again.  See here for the real thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z_qLYcUARM&feature=related

In all it isn't close to the true carne asada restaurants in Hermosillo.  Until you try the real thing you will think this is great, but once you do try the real thing you will know what I'm talking about.  I'm not knocking what is delicious to you but when I was kid I loved  Chef Boyardee, but that didn't last into adulthood when I had real, fresh made ravioli.

I ordered the oxymoronic 'large burrito'.  Burritos are little burros, so to have a large little burrito on the menu sounds dumb.  A lot of tortilla, skimpy on meat, not very flavorful (lack of beefiness (not grass fed), lack of smokiness (no mesquite wood, not sure of the flavor profile of natural gas), lack of spiciness (salt, lime, seasoning).

Overall, it is 'safe' food for gringos that aren't adventurous enough.  So, it is similiar to a Chipotle, Baja Fresh or Qdoba.  It tastes good, no worries, but it isn't the pinnacle.  Don't look for value, you won't find it.  I didn't try the al pastor or anything else so I cannot comment on that.  

I would suggest you go to a local carniceria, buy some arrachera with marinade, take it home and grill it over mesquite charcoal, wrap the meat in a Carolina's tortilla and you will see how much ATS (and the other chains) misses the mark."}
{"text":"Every bite I had was spectacular - sure, the choices are limited, but I appreciate when someone hones in on something they do exceptionally well.

My main problem is portions. While cheap, the amount of food is tiny. I got 3 tacos @ $2.25/each and I got about 2-3 bites out of each taco. So, while cheap I would have had to spend another $6 to get enough."}
{"text":"LOVE THE CEVICHE!!! Haven't had too much else but the tamarind margaritas and ceviche where GREAT! IT\"S A MA AND PA type restaurant so stop your whining about the ambiance, it has character. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the size of my margarita....it was small:( If your in the area I'd say its worth stopping in before it gets too hot:)"}
{"text":"No, not named for this great country of ours, but for America, the owner. Went there based on a recommendation from a friend at work, and he was right...this place was great. Had the carne asada burrito. The meat was perfectly flavored and the burrito was freshly made. It could not have been better. Opted for the pricey Coca Cola from Mexico. Very good, but at $3 a bottle, a little pricey, especially where I tend to drink a lot of soda when I eat lunch. They now have a liquor license, so they offer a variety of Mexican brand beers. Sodas come in bottles and cans, depending on the brand. One nice option I liked was they accept credit cards, which at first isn't obvious. There are no signs that they take credit. The only way I knew was seeing a tiny magnetic strip reader next to the cash register. The restaurant is inside an old, small house, so there isn't a lot of room, and it's tough to find seating if you're more than a party of two. There is off-street parking behind the restaurant, but again, it's the back yard to an old home, so parking can be tight."}
{"text":"Wow that Kevin guy is really neat. When he took my order we made eye contact and it was love at first sight. Every minute I look at him I fall more and more in love. He has the body of a young Hugh Jackman. He us so hot. 10 out of 10 would bang. Kevin Dwork is America's taco shop. Plus the food is really good."}
{"text":"The hubby and I have been waiting for this little Taco Shop to open up (hadn't heard of the other locations) and were there opening day.  Great relaxed environment, friendly staff (though it was the first day...so I'm sure they were on good behavior), fair prices ($5 for a burrito) and a ton of sauce selections.  Hubby loved the carne asada and raved about the tortilla...just enough chewy to soft ratio.  I enjoyed the bean burro and we're looking forward to future fun on their patio with friends.  Looks like they have a good happy hour deal and would be perfect for hangin' around a random Thursday night."}
{"text":"Really tasty Mexican food. Got the Asada Breakfast burrito. Little warning don't eat it in your car. By the time I got to the bottom of it the grease was dripping out of it. Other than that fast service and the counter girl was all smiles."}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch today and I walked away VERY happy! I had the Carne Asada Torta and I swear by the end I was stuffed but I did not want it to end! I wanted more! The meat is flavorful and accompanied by soft bread, mayo, guacamole, lettuce, and sliced jalepeno the whole thing is heaven! For being a Saturday it was not busy so our wait for the food was very minimal. I got the ceviche to go and I started eating it as soon as I got home, I couldn't wait. I love a good ceviche and this one is not too spicy and the shrimp are still tender (haven't been sitting in the liquid too long and continue to \"cook\" and get tough). I will be back, too bad I have to drive a ways to get here!"}
{"text":"Kitschy Mexican surf atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food. Prices are a little high for this type of Mexican fare, but they're justified by the high-quality, fresh ingredients used. Rethink what you know about a bean and cheese burrito...theirs is a lard-free blend of beans and cheese in a lightly grilled tortilla. But it's the carne asada that's front and center here. The carne asada quesadilla and their specialty, the vampiro, are both exceptional. Add the unique America's corn and you've got yourself quite a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Besides the little street taco cart that is parked in a lot on 28th st and Mcdowell that I go to for my carne asada tacos...this comes in 2nd place:)  I am really picky about carne asada...many places make them either too dry or not flavorful enough...well not my little street taco cart,,,,and not my America's Taco shop!!!
I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla....
I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else...
Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"My favorite vegetarian Items at America's are the bean and cheese burrito, the breakfast burrito without chorizo, and the ranchero burrito (I like to order it without onion or tomato). Chips are tasty, as well as their salsa and horchata. Their happy hour is good."}
{"text":"Been multiple times. Slowest service possible. Today, was the only one there, and it took 10 minutes for 2 carne tacos and a corn. And, there was no effort whatsoever to make it speedy. Also, service is average at best. Fix this and I'll be here far more often."}
{"text":"This place is AWSOME!! The carne asade tacos are the best I have had in long time. Everything was perfect from guacamole to chips and salsa (salsa I have to say is better then my sis) oh and the carne asada quesadilla is home run!!! The atmosphere is ok inside is limited seating but you can also sit outside where there is plenty of shade. Also the parking lot is also limited so if you are there when it is rush hour be prepared to find parking spot."}
{"text":"$5.79 for an XL bean and cheese burrito that was only about 5 bites.  What the hell??  
On the bright side, all 5 bites were good."}
{"text":"At long last, America's Taco Shop is finally open. Unfortunately, they're not open very late just yet--they close at 8pm on the weekends. And they're still working on the liquor license thing. And a couple of other just-open restaurant quirks. Luckily, they are extremely excited and eager to please. 

Their Mexican waters were unbelievable (go with the Tamarindo), and big gulp sized. The corn was awesome as well. All grilled up and slathered with mayo, cotija cheese and hot sauce. I also ordered a quesadilla vegetariana, which could have stood a bit of flavor (the owner went to get salsa, but never came back...seriously), but was not at all bad. Next time I'll try their bean burrito, which is made without any lard in the mix.

The price is right, and they're right around the corner, so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am giving this a 2 star and not 1, because I went back a second time! I really really want to like this place. However, the food needs about a pound of salt, and I don't usually add salt. It lacks any kind of flavor.

However, I love the watery guac and at 25 cents a side mixed it with those watery beans and add some salt MMMM. The steak is cut to perfection, but lacks flavor. THe tortillas are soft, but the portions are also very small. Also the sodas are really expensive I think our bottle of coke was $3.00 granted it was a bottle but still?? I do want to go back though and try again maybe I will have better luck!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food is good, it's the portion size that really leaves me unsatisfied every time I leave.  I'm not a big eater, I'm happy with a medium sized dish or even splitting sometimes, but the portion size at America's taco shop is consistently tiny.
Also the vegetarian options are terrible. I really wish they would grill vegetables. Their plain bean and cheese burritos are boring and not something a vegetarian would get a second time here."}
{"text":"We went to this place because we were looking for somewhere near downtown Tempe. When we entered this place, it was like private mom/pop shop with young workers. We ordered some large burrito and Quesadia. They were all right for the price! Also, I was surprised to see $2,00 beer per bottle special, which I have seen so many times when I passed by this store. I believe this is their sales tactic. The food here is normal and price are good in general. I would revisit here again, but also order some good margarita or beer which goes well with those meal."}
{"text":"Don't order the vegetarian quesadilla here. Just a tortilla with cheese and lettuce. I would have been happy with Taco Bell quesadilla and packaged sauce instead of this. I was surely disappointed by my decision to eat here. I had ordered that day's special dish (very cheap). I was not very hungry. I would not recommend this place to anyone (or anyone vegetarian)."}
{"text":"I love this place! So good and such a variety! I always get the three taco combo- each is a little different and hits the spot! Plus they have amazing happy hour- $2 tacos & $1 chips- can't beat that! It's little corner restaurants like this that make a quick bite out so awesome! The staff is always super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Can I just say...this place is AMAZING!!!  Terry was super nice and made the delivery himself!  I really want to give them a shout out for being totally authentic, we fed 17 people and not one complaint!!!  THANK YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!

They use ranchera carne asada... way better quality meat than most shops. Get the EXTRA LARGE carne asada burrito. The regular size is too small. 

Price wise, America's is going to be expensive compared to the cheap burrito places. But they make up for it in quality. 

The \"Best carne asada in Phoenix\" is not at this place... It's at my house! haha.

Good place to catch lunch. Don't expect to be blown away... but it's enjoyable."}
{"text":"So, went back to ATS last weekend with the GF BF and really really enjoyed everything we had! So glad they added the additional seating out front so it isn't such a \"Survival of the Fittest\" situation and the horchata....seriously! I could have drank the entire jug she poured it from!

We also had the carne asada tacos, a vampiro each and yes, a piece of heaven sent corn! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Fairly decent Mexican place with great outdoor seating (although we got swarmed by bees so had to relocate indoors). I was pretty shocked at how pricey our meal was: $40 for 6 tacos, chips, salsa, guac and 2 margs for two people. The tacos are really small so 3 is pretty standard fare. 

That said the flavor of the al pastor was good, and the salsa tasted fresh and spicy. Would be a great place to visit during their happy hour."}
{"text":"If I could give this place minus 5 stars it would be appropriate. Nearly $13 for a burrito and a coke. The burrito was mostly an extra large flour tortilla with nothing in it but some veggie and about 2 ounces of meat.....literally, I'm not exaggerating. An extra large $8.50 burrito should fill up a grown man but this may possibly fill up an 8 year old girl. If  you like being ripped off and taken advantage of go here!"}
{"text":"I do not understand why people are saying this is the best carne asada they've ever had.This place is really horrible! 

It was like having my old high school cafeteria making me tacos. Absolutely  no flavor in the meat! No flavor in condiments on taco or taco shell, or sauce. The amount of meat was very small. The chips and salsa was like it was from taco bell or something. The only flavorful thing I had there was the mexican bottled coke that was way overpriced, $3!
Even the ambiance was low grade. Uncomfortable chairs and no personality.
I am actually angry about this place getting good reviews. It is soooo easy to take beef, marinate it and grill it up and make it delicious. 
Maybe the people who think this is the best carne asada should go to the closest roach coach and get a real carne asada taco, it would be cheaper and 100 times better."}
{"text":"Meh, I have had way better. Really sterile environment at this location.  Nothing like the 7th  ave location.  Food was bland at best and there was a ton of lettuce inside the quesadilla.  Who puts shredded lettuce inside a quesadilla?  Mmmm lettuce quesadilla....."}
{"text":"This place is just terrible. Although it appears clean inside, the servers were inattentive and seemed to all hate each other.

There are virtually no vegetarian options. I ordered a veggie quesadilla. When it finally came out, I unfolded the 5\" tortilla to find uncooked onions, wilted lettuce, cheese, and a small smear of guacamole. I didn't even take a bite. I took it back to the counter and asked for my money back. I was so disappointed. 

I should say that I am very thankful they were willing to give me my money back, but I will never go there again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Let me just start this review off with I'm NOT a fan of Mexican food, and my significant other will barely tolerate Chipotle. We stumbled upon this place after going to the pool at Valley Ho. We were starving and the food at the hotel was not cutting it. We walk up and there is a little sandwich board sign with all of the day's specials including a chorizo breakfast burrito for $4. SOLD. 

Environment: Inside is small and quaint but the outdoor patio is absolutely charming. We stayed inside since it was the middle of summer but we've gone back in cooler weather and it was so relaxing outside. 

Food: Carne asada taco, Al pastor burrito, Chorizo breakfast burrito were all delicious. This place has some of the freshest and healthiest mexican fast food in town with reasonable prices. The ingredients tasted fresh and it didn't look like I was going to get Salmonella just by sitting down. They had horchata, tamarind and hibiscus drinks. I've only tried the Hibiscus and it was a little too sugary for me but then again McD's sweet tea hurts my teeth. 

One of my friends got up and ordered 3 times,  the food was that good. The portions are on the smaller side but then again the prices are so cheap you can afford to order 2 or 3 entree items for under $10. I definitely wish they were open late so I could come here instead of going to Gus' or Philly Cheesesteak. f I want Mexican, this is the place I go."}
{"text":"This place is really good and close to campus.  They moved in after Papa Johns closed and I heard from either a magazine or some sort of food magazine that said to stop in.   

The thing about the Taco Shop is that they have really good Burritos and all sorts of great mexican delights that will fill you up and leave you satisfied.  There menu is diverse enough to give anyone something to munch on.

It is a step up from Filibertos or Taco Bell and  is very different tasking then the Chipotle burrito.  This is where I must say if you have the craving of Chipotle your obviously going to go there, but switch it up one time.  

It is conveniently located to ASU campus and they have amazing salsa and chips.  I have dreams about there red salsa now, it haunts me with its good taste.

Recommendation: For people want a taste other-than Chipotle , making the change, for a more authentic mexican meal for its pricing, taste and red salsa."}
{"text":"Just went for lunch and was disappointed.  This place was one of my favorite places to go to until today.  I'd stopped going as I'd been disappointed before but today, the food was completely flavorless.   I too have been looking for great tacos in convenient locations in the Valley and this place came close to my liking.  Perhaps this chain grew too big to maintain the quality it once had.  And before I get a rude rebuttal, I'm Mexican-American and from Chicago.  I know what good authentic Mexican food is supposed to taste like.  Hope the food is cooked with flavor again to return.   Til then, good riddance..."}
{"text":"Amazing spot for quick, casual, and authentic tacos. We stayed at the Valley Ho and walked over for lunch. We had the quesadilla and the three tacos - DELICIOUS! The Al Pastor is awesome! This will definitely be a must-stop when we are in Scottsdale visiting next time."}
{"text":"I wish I had checked the reviews before eating here. Even eat is all dry and chewy. The service is slow. The hot sauce is not hot it taste like sweet sauce.  The beans are crunchy/undercooked"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place as I had heard good things about America's from friends.  Plus, having lost Baja I wanted a new place.  What a disappointment!  The place still looks like Baja Fresh but there the comparisons end.  The food was meh.  Plus having my food arrive minutes after my husband's and still be cold was kind of ridiculous.  I think they actually forgot to prepare mine at first.  Since there were only a few other customers there, there was no excuse.  I should have known not to eat there because there were so few customers at noon.  Baja used to be out the door at that time.  

Basically, you have four options for protein (beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables) and you can have it in a burrito, taco, vampire (tostada), or salad.  The chicken had a sour taste altho it was supposed to be citrus and grilled.  The carne asada was dry and flavorless.  We didn't try the others, but don't really feel a need.

Maybe the other locations of America's are better, but I probably won't even try.  Chipotle it is!"}
{"text":"1st time here....2 beers, 2 street tacos, chips and guac...only $8.72!!! Super friendly and great tasting. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We travelled fr Carlsbad, CA to Phoenix, AZ for this and boy was it worth it!!  OK, we were visiting family outside of Phoenix but it was still worth the visit.  Carne Asada burrito - yummy!  Bean and Cheese burrito - yummy!  Service - great.  The owner and staff were all extremely attentive.  My ONLY qualm, the burritos, quesadillas could be a bit larger.  America's Taco Shop, when are you coming to North San Diego County, CA?  Cannot wait!"}
{"text":"After hearing about this place for months and a rough night out at Canteen Tequila Bar I finally tried America's Taco Shop and I'm hooked. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. The service was quick and friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We will always eat here when we are up in Phoenix from Tucson.
One of our favorite places.
I have not had a bad meal there yet and we have eaten there so many times.
A local merchant told us about this place.
I can see why local business employees go there all the time."}
{"text":"The place is very clean! The tacos are a good size! Healthy, not too heavy and the carne asad is WONDERFUL! I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is really good! The people on here complaining about portion sizes are probably over weight and could afford to go for a run every now and then. Over sized portions are the reason this Country is obese!  Flavor is amazing here! Slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"We visited this location for the first time on a slower day and they took the extra effort to make our experience even better! The location is phenomenal and the food was even better! More importantly the service was truly great; from the ordering to after we had sat down and begun eating. It was as if we were at a 5-star restaurant for a 1-star price. Thank you America's Taco shop, we will definitely be returning many times!"}
{"text":"I used to like this place but the past few months the service and food have spiraled downward. Food is average and the past 4 times they have messed up either my order or the order of someone in my party. Staff is unapologetic and occasionally rude. Sometimes success leads to complacency, and I think that is what happened to America's. Needless to say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Been living in this 'hood for 20 years. So good to see this spot do well, especially with this economy. Takes a leap of faith to open any new business these days. Good groceries!
-----
UPDATED 3.15.13-Sounds like Sheriff Joe is not a fan!  We will NOT be back."}
{"text":"I had to see what all this hype was about so I soon became a regular at America's. I really love their tacos al pastor and love getting their ice tea with the hibiscus mixed in! Great to grab to-go to enjoy by the pool too!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times once for lunch and twice for dinner. Lunch was pretty crowded, dinner not so much but tons of take out. Prices are cheap and food is good! 

I love the beans and I recently tried the guacamole and loved it. Try it out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"This guy at work raved about this place, so I decided to check it out .

Pros 
-I have to admit one of my pastor tacos was pretty good. 
-The salsa that came with the chips had a decent flavor.

Cons
-The Carne Asada was kind of dry, the meat just tasted like meat.... nothing special.
-$2.25 for a taco was kind of steep for a small taco.  
-Overpriced Bottle Soda. 
-The meat in one of my Pastor tacos was really hard. 

Will I go back.... Probably not."}
{"text":"I love their vegetarian bean and cheese burritos!  The chips and salsa are good too."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time today and it was mediocre at best. My dislike started when I was putting in an online order and realized it was $2.59 PER TACO! That's not what I was looking for especially for Taco Tuesday. So I precede to call and ask if they have any specials. They did. $2.00 tacos for Taco Tuesday. Ok fine I give in because I have been really wanting to experience this place on my own in spite of the negative reviews. I go. Get my tacos. Eh, kind of plain. Tortillas were a little soggy, but maybe because I placed my order on the phone? Who knows, I went immediately to pick them up so shouldn't have been sitting for too long. The spicy salsa wasn't the least bit spicy and I'm sensitive to spicy food. Oh well, just not the place for me."}
{"text":"You will get the shits after eating here.... tried several times since I work close....  myself and coworkers all have the same result with different menu items.....  pass by, eat somewhere else.

You will thank me later"}
{"text":"This place is damn GOOD!  

The carne asada, salsa, the beans and cheese are delicious.  The horchata is genuine and creamy, not watered down like other places.  

And the place itself is comfortable and very inviting.  

Love you America!

I always come back here for my mexican craving."}
{"text":"I have been to other locations and liked the food and I drive by this new location all the time so I finally tried it. I was very disapointed in the food. I ordered a taco and burrito. The taco was not bad but the burrito was not tasty. My friend ordered a burrito as well and was very disapointed. The parking can be limited here as well. I'm hoping they can fine tune and make some corrections for improvements."}
{"text":"Bad expensive tacos. The guaco is not bad. But the asada is gamy and chicken dry. I dont get what people like about them..... This place is not overrated, its awful.
Go to Taco Guild instead"}
{"text":"Honestly I wasn't all that impressed with this place.
Pretty limited menu, the portions are tiny, and they charge for salsa (which was mediocre).

The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley.  Not sure what valley they are talking about, but definitely not the best in phoenix.  Although it was good, I would put it at about average for carne asada.

The location was great and the building was kind of cool, but the seating was very limited and there seemed to be some wasted space.  

All in all, I thought the food was okay, but overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Counter service was OK, table service whas what you would expect, however what I was anticipating to be very good carne asada based on the reviews from the other locations was medicore at best same with the chicken taco.  I like the location it's a good vibe, nice casual seating out back, hope they can work out the food issues."}
{"text":"I go to America's a lot because it's close to work and has an amazing coffee/horchata mixture known as the \"cochata.\"  Seriously, people.  Do it.  The horchata at America's is outstanding on its own, but adding a bit of coffee to it makes it even more delicious.  

The other reason I find myself patronizing this restaurant so often is their tasty breakfast burritos, which are on special Saturday mornings.  I would give an additional star, but the service is often slooooooow, even when the restaurant is not very crowded.  I also think the menu pricing is a bit expensive for the portion size."}
{"text":"Love this place. They set the standard for all their competitors to reach. This location seems to have the best ingredients made with love! They even have a habanero purée for those of us who like it spicy!  Enjoy your visit, I did!"}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada breakfast burrito. The most bland burrito I have eaten since the invention of the microwave. I assume it was the carne asada burrito, there was no evidence of meat to confirm this claim. I'll go back once more to try the quesadilla. Not going to hold my breath though."}
{"text":"I don't know of it was because i was hungover and starving, but the burrito and bottle of fanta i got were great."}
{"text":"Favorite take out Mexican food in town. The bean and cheese burrito is my go-to order, and it never fails. The homemade beans are so delicious and the tortilla is thin and buttery making it a true authentic experience. The atmosphere is awesome because it is situated in an old house complete with a backyard with a fountain and a large tree, perfect for an impromtu photo shoot!  Also they serve Coke products, always a plus! Great service and hospitality too. A downside is their lack of complimentary chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Took my family here on Sunday for a quick bite. Carne asada burrito and tacos and bean burritos were our order. Atmosphere and food reminded me of my favourite taco shops in San Diego. Carne asada wasn't over cooked and the bean burritos hit the spot."}
{"text":"Looks very nice of a place and seemd to have good specials. I ordered what I thought would be plenty of food to feed me. I thought $14 of food should be plenty, boy oh boy was I sure wrong. The portions are a absolute joke. They barely would feed a 5 year old. I will never go back again. Stay away unless you like to overpay."}
{"text":"I would go to many fast food chains with happy hour and had no issues with paying happy hour prices for takeout. Unfortunately, not at America's Taco Shop on 16th and Camelback.  For two carne asada tacos and one order of chips and salsa-$8.09. My first time here in the city coming from another state,  and for that price, I thought a burrito was a better deal. I had to change my order right away.  The guy taking my order was not happy that he had to \"delete everything\" and a bad attitude went with the deleted order; talk about terrible service and understanding from someone who can speak good english. I would understand if the place was busy but it was empty. I had to leave that place QUICK! Never felt that uncomfortable being in a fast food restaurant and I would certainly not want to try the food after that experience. I can take my money elsewhere!

 After reading the reviews on yelp, so happy I didn't try it and went with a healthier option. And the guy who stood at the cashier  happily shouted as I walked out the door, \"Thanks Annie!\" How condescending can he be, and its not good for customer service. He really sucks. Never coming back. Stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"Barely mediocre. I'm giving it two stars because it didn't come back up."}
{"text":"Not the greatest but in the right place at the right time. From hungry belly to happy belly."}
{"text":"This place is never open during the posted hours. What's the point in serving breakfast burritos if you don't open until 11am? I would love to give you business if you were ever open. Maybe you should change all the online posts that say you open at 9am."}
{"text":"We wanted to see what the hype was about this place, so my lady and I crawled out of bed at noon and came here for lunch. 
We came on a Saturday afternoon, there were a few people dining in. I had the carne asada burrito and my girl had the carne asada tacos. The food was tasty, and hot. I'm sure about how I feel about all they hoopla over this place. It was a decent place to grab a bite to eat. The Horchata was good, and they sell Mexican Coca-Cola. The price was all right, but you could definitely get carne asada at a Filibertos or any of the other 'Bertos for that matter that was just as tasty and for a few less dollars.

*Update* I received an email from the proprietor of this Taco shop, he stated to me that \"if you can not see the difference in quality from us and the other \"Bertos\", maybe this isn't the place for you\"...

I'm not sure why a restaurant owner would shoo away a guest, especially a guest who said the food was good, he was just not understanding of the hype. 
So if you're like me, and think Filibertos is good, keep going there, because obviously, the owner of this establishment doesn't need our business"}
{"text":"I don't write reviews, this place is complete shit, eat anywhere else!!!! Everything here is disgusting!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here today for the first time and was pleased!  The people working there were all so sweet and friendly - excellent service.  And the food was yummy.  And no lard in the beans - which is important to me.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food, stop in for $1 happy hour tacos ~ they are delish. Service is TERRIBLE !! If you go be prepared to sit outside in the heat, misters off so the staff can nap at the few tables inside under the a/c !!!"}
{"text":"The carne asada is indeed the best I've had in town. No gristle or fatty bits to pick out, no salt overload to beat my tongue into submission. Pure, lovingly marinated, perfectly browned steak chopped into the ideal sized pieces for a clean bite without trailing bits falling onto the table. The accompanying salsa is a wonderfully mild, smoky addition to the flavor which doesn't overpower the beefy goodness.

The al pastor pork is unbelievable as well. Lean, marinated pork roasted on a vertical spit, topped with a hunk of pineapple, is shaved off to order. Whatever is in America's marinade is outstanding, and the pineapple adds a little bit of heavenly sweetness and tang which pairs perfectly with the meat. As with the carne asada, the accompanying salsa (a lighter tomatillo concoction) adds flavor without smothering the pork flavor.

If you're looking for cheap, greasy Mexican food regardless of quality, go find a 'bertos. Americas is all about the quality. Their horchata is the genuine article, not a sickly-sweet bastardized rendition from a food-service tub. The Chorizo in the breakfast burritos is locally sourced. The tortillas are fresh and delicious. Even the iced tea is great.

The service is enthusiastic and friendly, and it's easy to tell the staff take pride in their work. Do yourself a favor, and ask for recommendations. I did, and now I'm hopelessly hooked on the al pastor."}
{"text":"Wish I could give this place a big \"ZERO\".  Doesn't matter how many times I have ordered my food without cheese - it comes with cheese.  SORRY ATS - not everyone likes that slimy white cheese you use, nor do they want it if they are lactose intolerant.

There are so many nice places in Scottsdale that can get it right!"}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop is one of my favorite places to eat and definitely my favorite fast Mexican food place. I particularity love the tacos and burritos (Al Pastor is yummy). The guacamole is very good and the salsas are second to none.

The Staff is courteous and friendly and the service is wonderful. I need to stop in for the breakfast menu as I have no doubt that is as wonderful as the regular menu."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good.  Something was lost in their quest to rapidly franchise.  Restroom is so unkempt that the smell fills half the restaurant. The outdoor seating is rickety and unsafe.  The meat just tastes.... odd.  I miss what America's used to be. Everything on the menu is ala carte so good luck putting together a meal for $, more like $$."}
{"text":"I love their salsa and chips! 

Best part of this place is the staff and the owners are so friendly and happy to see you. They appreciate the business and make an extra effort to make sure your order is prepared correctly.

Great local business.

4 out of 5 stars only because the interior dining area is tiny. There is a patio but it's a bit uncomfortable to sit out there when it's over 100 degrees. Also, lunch lines can get long since they are located so close to the ASU campus. Once school starts, I'm sure the lines will only get longer."}
{"text":"Yes, it's a small, local, independent, etc., food establishment. You get a star or two for that.

But the food isn't great. Don't get me wrong, it's decent, solid food. But for two tiny carne asada tacos and a drink for nearly $10, am I some sort of evil villain for expecting something more-than-decent? The carne asada is well-made, so I have no qualms with that. But I wouldn't call America's \"cheap\".

I'm also surprised at the number of reviews here claiming that it's nigh impossible to find good Mexican food in Phoenix. What are all of you, Harry Mortons?

I don't hate the place by any means, the food is alright. But I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again. Nothing knocks my calcetines off."}
{"text":"Yikes! My neighborhood has a \"FOOD\" thief in it!  I was robbed!  I stopped going to America's taco shop after trying it a few times when I lived in the Roosevelt hood.  Now i make my home in the Coronado hood and felt I would give it another try. So for the past few weeks, I ran over a few blocks to grab some grub.  I ordered the carne asada burrito.  Same old burrito as before, undercooked tortilla, carne asada was GOOD, but barely any of it.  It was lunch time so I gave the cooks the benefit of doubt. Til the next week, I had a burrito and pastor tacos,  and the same thing as above.  The meat is GOOD, but I walked away feeling I missed something.  Oh!  Could it be the MEAT!  Tonight, I go up the street again. Why do I do this to myself, SHAME ON ME,  I know better.  I grabbed the special of the evening the torta pastor.  Torta has a big bun lots of flavorless green mayo (was that suppose to be avocado), and NO MEAT!  Okay 1/2 of cup of meat...it was GOOD meat, but in the words of Wendy's...Where's the beef?   I feel robbed,  my good green money was stolen and I handed it over to the \"FOOD\" thief in the little yellow house.  Bummer neighbor, bummer.

Where's a good roach coach when you need it?"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to America's T.S.. The first was worthy of a 5 stars. But that's because my Vampiros included free large chips and salsa. My more recent visit for lunch was so-so. I ordered the Vampiro Carne Asada. After a good wait the waitress delivered what I thought as a free 5\" Tostada sampler. I asked is this what I ordered for $3.79 ...Yes, we make our own tortillas fresh. The food was tasty but but I walked out still hungry so I headed to Costco for a hot dog and free samples."}
{"text":"The taste of the food was alright but the problem was that the food made me sick.
 I have eaten in the worst places and have never gotten sick and my stomach doesn't reflect so easily to bad food. 
But this place made me sick and will never go there again. I don't recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is really good here, if there are a couple of major gripes about this establishment is that they close VERY early at 8:00pm. I don't know about most people, but for me dinner is about at 8 or 9 pm. So its really an inconvenience. But again, if you can make it there before the close, the food is wonderful and the staff are polite. The other gripe I have about this place is that the expect a tip as clearly available on the credit card receipt, which would be okay if they actually serve me, but they never do. It would be the equivalent of adding a tip at a McDonalds, would you do it? Of course not."}
{"text":"I have never been to any other America's Taco Shop before so I can't speak for other locations but I can tell you that I will not come here again.  I came for lunch here with a couple buddies and were completely unsatisfied with the food portions we ordered.   To be honest the food wasn't the greatest either. For the prices they charge I expected a lot more.  What's up with the flat burrito? Sad to say but we left there almost as hungry as when we arrived."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this spot open up. It's much closer to my house than the 7th Ave and St locations. I would always go to the 7th ave location and the food is great.

This location has issues that will hopefully improve with time. I've been twice

1st visit - I ordered 2 al Pastor tacos, one carne asada taco, and chips and guac. They forgot the pineapple on the al pastor tacos and the carne asada was grey and chewy (inedible).

2nd visit - Skipped the carne asada all together, and got two al pastor tacos and chips and guac. Pineapple made it into the tacos this time. But, the chips were stale and chewy. 

Not sure if I will make it back to this location."}
{"text":"Yummy! Great service, great food, nice laid back ambiance! The bowls are great and the beans are amazing! The check in offer is a nice addition while your waiting!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I've had both the tacos and burritos. Their gucamole is also quite yummy. On the downside, I think their portions are a little on the small side."}
{"text":"Nothing special and overprice due to this fact. Either prices need to be cut or quality needs to go up a notch. Disappointed overall... I probably would not come back unless things changed. People were nice though"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the Carne Asada here yet (but I know I will be back to do so) but all I can say is BEST BEAN & CHEESE BURRITO EVER!!!

After reading some reviews on yelp I decided to go and pick up lunch at America's.  The parking was a bit tricky to figure out at first, and I wouldn't recommend going after you get your car washed or if it is raining because it is just a dusty, dirt lot; but once I got inside and got my burrito, all was forgotten.

They advertise that they don't use any lard in their beans...and well, lard is usually what makes the beans so creamy and delicious; so I was intrigued.  Well upon my first bite, I was not missing the lard at all!  The tortilla was so fresh and delicious, and the beans, oh the beans, were creamy and had just the right amount of melted Monterrey jack cheese mixed in with them.  I was in heaven...and for only $3.25....this is definitely a budget friendly and waistline friendly meal!  

P.S. I only ate half of the burrito to start with, and then ate the other half later cold....it was almost even better cold!

I will be back...and next time...I will try to force myself to try the carne asada!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today.. I ordered the taco combination plate ($7.19). It is only a combo in that there are three different types of tacos (carne asada, chicken, and pastor (Pork). It did not come with any side or drink.. So I ordered a side of beans  ($1.69) and a soft drink. The tacos came out on the little 4 inch corn tortillas, and each taco MIGHT have had an ounce and a half of meat in them. The beans came in a small little plastic souffle cup, maybe 3 ounces at most. They were bland pureed beans, with a pinch of cheese melted on top. 

For my 3 tacos, spoonful of beans and a drink, I paid over $11.00. Definitely NOT worth the price. Next time I will go to Chipotle, or the Stand on Indian School. At the Stand, the tacos are about $2.50 each, but they come packed with meat and toppings."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday during happy hour,tacos were supposed to be half price,they weren't and they weren't any good either.No booze here  and it didn't feel like any air conditioning. Blech... try Los Dos Molinos for real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Burritos are alright.  I had the Carne asada burrito - it was decent but seems like the price is a bit high."}
{"text":"I am so excited to have Americas Taco shop in Mesa now!!! Love their food, always good!!!"}
{"text":"My first experience going here wasn't positive. I was shopping and came lunch time and heard about the taco shop. I decided to give a shot. I was looking at the menu and when I finally ordered, the employee said, there was no al pastor ready. That seemed odd since it was about 11:30 am and one of the signature items. Does McDonalds run out of cheeseburgers?  He could have told me when I was waiting there that they were out of a menu item. . Unhappy, I went somewhere else to eat.

My next venture was more successful (just recently). I ordered 3 al pastor tacos. The tacos came out fresh and flavorful. There was a bit of a wait, probably 7-10 minutes to get my tacos which was a bit disappointing.

I also enjoyed the crushed ice that the fountain drinks are served with, much better than cubes. The only problem I was very thirsty and drank most of the soda while waiting for the tacos. Refills are extra, bummer.

I would head back just for the el pastor tacos as that is something that is not easily found and when you do find it, not always good."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our lunch at this taco shop. We tried both the al pastor and chicken tacos . The pork in the al pastor tacos was very dry and overlooked. The chicken taco was extremely bland. We were drawn in by their taco Tuesday special but clearly you get what you pay for in this case."}
{"text":"I'm probably going to move out of Arizona soon, and I keep thinking that ATS is one of my regular food stops that I just won't be able to replace. My go to menu items are: torta al pastor, America's corn, carne asada tacos, and cochata (half horchata and half iced coffee). My vegetarian friends always get the bean burrito \"pastor style\" with pineapple and cilantro. I love it all."}
{"text":"Al pastor tacos and agua frescas are great. Have yet to try the margaritas, but it's on the to-do list. I recommend their guacamole to everyone!"}
{"text":"We always like this spot. Great and affordable tacos. Nothing that really knocks your socks off, but always a good quick bite."}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place I had to try it. I got three Tacos, very bland nothing special, a side of beans,lard free and the guacamole got the two starts. No service at all, or they must have been short of people. The server forgot the beans and finally my friend had to go to the counter and ask for it ( probably overlooked).  We were done with the tacos. 

The tacos, reminded me of \"where is the canasada?\" very little beef, the shredded lettuce didnt add anything and the salsa did not have any flavoring or punch. I love to support locally owned business, unfortunately we will not go back."}
{"text":"Just left America's taco shop. Have not been here in years and I was very disappointed. This place has gone down hill, spent $28. 00 and I should have gone to Del taco the food is better and cheaper. The burrito had very and I mean very little meat and was bland at best. The tacos were tasteless. Big disappointment, there are a lot better taco joints in town, save your money and go elsewhere. Sad to see this used to be my go to place for tacos."}
{"text":"This place does it right with great ingredients that result in a really good taco.  I had the taco al pastor and it was very good.  Their chips and salsa are excellent and this is coming from a Texas guy who knows good salsa.

Now on to the most interesting part, the corn...I can almost guarantee that you've never had corn on the cob like this!  I'm not even sure it's fair to label it corn on the cob out of fairness to what you're used to.  This sweet corn on the cob is coated with a light smear of mayo (don't judge it till you try it!) and then generously sprinkled with fine ground Mexican cheese.  The result is amazing!  As if that's not enough, they serve it with a little container of sauce that is quite hot and complements the sweetness of the corn.  This is a must try if you're a corn lover!"}
{"text":"Great food every visit! I'm not sure why others are giving it such low ratings, but I've also never been to the other locations. I love the chips and salsa and the quesadillas are unbelievable! I didn't think the price was outrageous - $15 for two with fountain drinks. Atmosphere is nothing to write home about but gets the job done. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Decent food but every time I'm here the service is bad. On my most recent trip, there was a line of 5 people and one girl was clearly not busy (yawning and standing around in the kitchen) yet couldn't help out and take orders. This place needs to improve its service and they'll see better reviews."}
{"text":"There's not a whole lot left to say except that great customer service, delicious food and very affordable prices make this place an amazing find and one of my favorite places to eat. Oh, and the Vampiro and horchata are truly to die for."}
{"text":"Meh

Staff and service were just fine.

Salsas were small in  portion and bordering on tasteless.  

Carne asade xl burrito was ok.  Considering the reputation, I was expecting some really flavorful meat.  Nope, it was good, but completely forgettable.  I did enjoy the lack of greasiness in the food though.  I'll come back, but I don't understand why it's so highly rated unless every other place is just that bad."}
{"text":"America's is awesome!  This place is no joke.  My favorites are the Carne Asada, Al Pastor, Bean & Cheese Burrito, and America's Corn.  Everyone I have told about this place loves it..."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on a weekday so it wasn't that crowded, and parking was not an issue in the dirt lot everyone raves about. Tacos were pretty good: I had one chicken, carne asada, and pork. The last 2 were the best. Their guacamole was tasty. Cashier and the other guy walking around (manager or owner?) were friendly and checked on us a few times. There is a large back patio area so if you want to enjoy some tacos outside before it heats up, check this place out."}
{"text":"If your looking for a normal sized burrito this is not the place.. I got my burrito and it looked like i had ordered from the kids menu.. Seriously the smallest burrito I've ever had."}
{"text":"Very convenient location right at the 101 in a little commercial area next to a gas station.  Can be busy at peak lunch time.  Breakfast all day too.  Reasonably priced, rather \"gringo\" Mexican food (perhaps the name was intentional for this reason).  The spicy salsa isn't at all spicy, which is just silly to me."}
{"text":"EH. My burrito was cold and El Pastor was way under seasoned. Such a bummer for such pricey food."}
{"text":"The tacos were great. I got the chargrilled 2 dollar Tuesday tacos.  They were yummy. It coulda been I had been apartment shopping all day and was starving but who knows. I'd go back.  The fried beans on the side were good also. The deal was nice 10 for 15"}
{"text":"Love America's.  I won't drag on about how awesome they are, but get the carne asada, the vampiro, and come in on a weekend for TO DIE FOR shrimp ceviche... nice and spicy."}
{"text":"Great food, small portions, high price and odd parking.

I had a small burrito and tea for $8, which isn't so bad if you would get chips or something and more than 3 bites out of this delicious burrito. Now I do have a big mouth but the burrito was still small.

I would pass on it."}
{"text":"this place is a local favorite for a reason. The menu is rather limited, but what they do they do very well. The house specialty is carne asada and you know it as soon as the car door opens. 

Get a soft taco or burrito, add the salsa, squeeze on the fresh lime and savor the simplicity of classic mexican flavors."}
{"text":"America's is obviously trying hard. They seem to be very media-aware and I think it's fair to say they have an enthusiastic local following. It is a charming little place, to be sure. Too bad it's all ruined by the brain-rattling ethno-techno soundtrack they've got bellowing from the speakers. Thankfully my Corona helped me avoid getting a headache. The menu is... odd. They have five or six offerings, but since all I'd heard about this place was \"carne asada!  carne asada!\" I uh... went for the carne asada.

I understand that there is authenticity and that authenticity comes with a price, but frankly, I really just don't CARE. I want my food to taste good and be reasonably priced and if it just so happens that the food also tastes exactly like your great aunt Carmelito made lo those many years ago in Oaxaca, the more's the better. This place serves mediocre (but authentic!) food in meager portions. The carne asada burrito, so breathlessly described by Phoenix magazine as not to be missed, is certainly delicious - but it took them 20 minutes to bring this out? Seriously? It's a kiddie burrito! On the side? A greying radish chunk. Yum! 

I will say the salsa is delicious. Darn near perfect. Just the right texture, just the right flavors, fresh with the perfect amount of heat. It's a good thing, too, because you have to pay for it. I'm not opposed to paying for chips and salsa, but considering that you get it free as a starter at a lot of Mexican restaurants these days, I'd at least like to be asked if I want a refill. I would heap similar praise on the guacamole, but the guacamole sucks. If this is how they make it in Old Mexico, I'd sooner have it from Taco Bell. It tasted like avocado paste with a hint of oil. I'm serious, I saw somebody talking about how great the guac was and wondered if I had stumbled into an alternate reality (to be fair, this does happen to me a lot).

All in all, I paid about the same I would pay at any other competent Mexican restaurant, and got about half the food. I know, I know, it's a taco shack, not a Mexican restaurant - but the prices aren't taco shack, and taco shacks don't generally do table service, so whatever. When this sort of thing happens to me, I inevitably demand that the food be so delicious that it overshadows everything else. This has happened to me before, but is simply not the case here."}
{"text":"This review is for the new location on 1615 E Camelback Rd Phoenix, AZ 85016. 

Terrible, Terrible, Terrible; my first experience to Americas Taco Shop was awful. 

1. The soda dispenser did not work. When they finally got it to work my soda had way too much syrup. 
2. I ordered two (2) grilled chicken tacos w/ chips and salsa to go. I only got one (1) grilled chicken taco and crushed chips. 
3. My taco fell apart while I was trying to eat it. It was not that good. The taco fell apart in my hand... C'mon. 
4. It took them a very long time to get my food ready. I placed my order at 11:49 am, they finally called my name at 12:13 pm. That is over 20 minutes for two (2) tacos, which I only received one (1). 20 minutes for one taco, again... C'mon! 
5. The wait was so long the guy before me, ordered his food, got a soda, waited, and waited... and waited. He just left and didn't get his food. 
6. There were more employees running around doing nothing, based on the disorganization of the place. In order for me to get my \"to go\" order, I had to wait for an employee to give it to me. 

Overall, terrible place. I will not go there again. I paid $8.47 for one (1) flimsy grilled chicken taco, a crushed bag of chips and a 20 oz. coke that had mostly syrup in it. Avoid this place, there is a McDonald's across the road, go there for better service and a complete order, and it will also be cheaper. And sadly, it will also taste better."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to taste what everyone has been talking about! Really fresh food, really good food and lots of it. 

I had the veggie quesadilla, a side of beans and a roasted jalapeno. The veggie quesadilla was simple - cheese, avocado, lettuce and peppers - but it was still tasty. I'm a sucker for beans, and although these weren't the best I'd ever had, they were still really good. I chopped up the jalapeno and added it to the beans. 

The 3.5 star rating that America's Taco Shop currently has (as of the beginning of January 2011) is not at all representative of the food and service that you'll get at the Shop. Go anyway, eat and be happy!"}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.

I live around the corner and since this place consistently has a line and people eating outside, I thought it must be good. Unfortunately, I also looked past my instinct to avoid any place with \"best _______________ in town\" on a sign out front.

I ordered the \"pastor\" tacos for quick bite and a XL carne asada burrito for some now, some later.

I'll start with the al pastor tacos... mediocre doesn't even begin to describe them. The corn tortillas were steamed and a bit undercooked, the pork was salty at best. I don't know why nobody can get it right here and insists that al pastor is just adobada on a vertical spit. Twenty-five million chilangos called and they're angry with you. I suppose I should have known better, ordering a DF dish from a Sinaloan-owned restaurant, but they could have at least succeeded with the onions and cilantro and a thin slice of warm pineapple. Like I said, not even mediocre.

Then there's the burrito... the reason I begrudgingly gifted America's two stars instead of one. They at least tried. The meat appeared to be arrachera (skirt steak) that had been over-marinated and lost its texture. It's really a shame when a place say they have CARNE ASADA and don't cook over an open flame.

Salsas were lifeless and they charge for chips. And as someone else pointed out... YOU CHARGE FOR JALAPENOS??? Come on now... I shop at Food City for my mexican produce and you're just being \"codo\" when it comes to this.

My advice: skip America's and head over to Villa la Parrilla next to Charlie's on Camelback. 

My wife and I (Coahuila Mexico and Northern California) agreed that its the only Mexican food we've had in town yet that was any good."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, but mostly- great service! I believe our cashier was Kevin and he was great. He made sure the kids had everything, from guac to straws. He sets the bar for ideal customer service. WILL BE COMING BACK SOON!"}
{"text":"After living in Sonora, Mexico for quite some time I developed quite the affinity for good carne asada tacos.  I find the inconsistencies among the many taquerias around valley frustrating.  I think after all these years, I have finally found my favorite carne asada in the valley.  

America's Taco Shop is a very cute local restaurant on a strip of 7th St. that has many more cute local restaurants.  Beyond that, it is a true carne asada taqueria.  The lack of authenticity only extends to the geographic location and overall atmosphere of the restaurant.  I can assure you, it ends there.  Being a first-generation Mexican-American, I have no problem whatsoever being served good carne asada (or any Mexican food for that matter) by a gringo, assuming said carne is up to my taste. 

And boy is it ever.  It brought me back to Bahia de Kino, sitting on the porch at La Pasadita, taking in the sea breeze, snacking on a radish after a few tacos.  The meat was tender and moist, held together well with the homemade salsa and excellent tortillas.  The only fault of this place was the premium paid over most local taquerias.  

A real, true carne asada shop has only that.  You've got to go to the right place to get the right stuff.  I can appreciate and respect a restaurant that is willing to bank on the quality of their product so much that it is all they offer.  The limited menu is a testament to their, and my, belief in America's family recipe.  

The expectation and desire for more serves only as evidence of our country's degradation.  We have become fat, lazy and unwilling to go the extra mile for something that we could at one time appreciate.  The idea that we should be able to get everything in one place is a glaring symbol of our wal-mart-oriented culture of instant gratification.  

The purpose of America's Taco Shop is to provide a place we can go to get one thing done right, not a collective of mediocrity.  When it can be appreciated as such, there is no need to expect more or be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here, the tacos, beans and the quesadilla were great and the margaritas very good as well. This is  one of my new stops while downtown. I love the little house that has been transformed into the fun place to eat. I took 7 people to a quick lunch everyone rave about the experience."}
{"text":"I ordered food online 30 minutes in advance. I came in and the order wasn't ready for another 20 minutes. Food sat out cold while the cashier jerked off and I got a cold unappetizing meal and was late back from my lunch. I saw five people get food before me that ordered while I was there in person. I ordered a salad. It's not rocket science. Utterly disgusted by this place. I hope they go out of business..."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because I'm currently living in Flagstaff and am missing my Taco Shop! 

I love this place because it's small, local and delicious. I used to come here 2-3 times a week and order the same thing: XL Bean and Cheese, Terry's way, add cilantro. I dream of this burrito, daily. Also, the cochata (coffee/horchata drink) is very yummy. 

I miss the warm greetings from Randy, one of the managers, and Patricia! 

America's Taco Shop (Melrose; 7th Ave) is always our first stop when coming to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Carlos working the grill was very courteous and respectful. Nice to see customer oriented service still is alive in some establishments.  The al pastor is excellent and the carne asada is very tasty as well"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last night after the Suns game. It was cheap and fast. Also, it was by far the best carne asada I have ever tasted. It was tender and juicy, and not at all rubbery. I know the last time I had carne asada it was rubbery, but that was also from a 'bertos joint. I enjoyed the way this place is set up. Walk up to the counter, order and they bring you your food. It is quick and efficient. We got the dinner for 2, 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips and drinks for $20. The tacos were great, as were the burros. I will definitely be back. 

Oh the 5 stars are specifically for the quick, efficient service... and the BEST carne asada around."}
{"text":"For a $6 carne asada burrito, the portions are very small. The steak is grilled well, but it's flavorless for the most part, and their salsa doesn't enhance the meal in any way. The place was clean and the $2 Pacifico's are a bonus. 

I was expecting more, and won't be returning, especially because of the portions. This is just another place that makes me want to help my mother start her own restaurant."}
{"text":"I have worked next door so I have had many experiences there. The food is expensive for what you get and Its just ok. The staff is RUDE especially since the new ownership. The Hispanic girl that works in the front with the long hair is NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL and does nothing for their business."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! My carne asada burrito was cold, the meat dry and tough and slightly crunchy! Only ate it because I was starving and out shopping and needed some fuel. Please don't waste your money here, it is not worth it."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for 4 tacos and a burrito. Only 2 other people in the whole place. Taste was OK. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fresh, delicious food, super reasonable prices, very friendly staff.  It is everything one could want in a neighborhood taco joint.

My favorite items are the horcheta with coffee (ridiculously good - tastes kind of like a chai latte mixed with coffee) and the al pasto quesadilla.  Usually get food to go; often for lunch and ocassionally bring home a bigger order for dinner.  There can be a line out the door at lunch, but they move it quickly and if you call in your order it is ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Food is good but prices are super expensive.  8 bucks for the \"Extra Large\" Carne Asada burrito and it's a little bigger then a Taco Bell bean burrito.  Don't get me wrong, it's good carne asada but you can get one at Filibertos and it's literally three times the size for 3 bucks.

Lower your prices or make the portions bigger - don't forget that you're using the cheapest cut of beef you can buy, marinating it with some orange juice, garlic and onions and then grilling it.  We're not talking Foie gras and heirloom tomatoes. 

And seriously, one piece of cucumber and a quarter of a radish?

I've gone there 4 or five times and each time do I'm left with the same opinion so here it is publicly."}
{"text":"It's great to have a something new in the area. I don't think the food is as great as everyone is posting. I believe there are better taco shops out there. Very limited menu. Would like to see some fish tacos. I think they could have some success with late night hours. And what's up with not having sour cream? Employees are friendly.  I hope this place grows and takes on more food options in the future."}
{"text":"I need to downgrade one star.....i feel that every time i am in the mood for a to go order it takes forever, and usually there are not many people in the restaurant, and also last time the carne asada it was a little less tender and the salsa is never spicy enough."}
{"text":"I don't see why America's gets such a low average rating. Prices are within a dollar or two of a cookie cutter 'bertos where the food you receive is questionable at best.  But food here is fresh, tasty, and unique. Is it unbelievable or absurdly cheap? No, by its darn good. 

I got 4 tacos today for $2 each. Carne Asada is the best."}
{"text":"My go-to place for quality Mexican food.  My favorite is the XL carne asana burro and a Corona with lime, but the tortas and tacos are great too.  It's a few bucks more than your average drunken burrito place that ends in \"ilibertos\" but the fresh ingredients and perfect execution make it worth it. Simple, good, and reliable."}
{"text":"Love the 7th Avenue location.... the food is awesome -- almost addicting!  And the staff is so friendly and helpful.  Love to hit this place up on a Saturday afternoon with my love for some refried beans heaven!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the area. I will agree with some other reviewers that holding yourself out to have the \"Greatest Carne Asada in the history of Creation\" might build the expectations up a bit high, but I sure didn't leave disappointed. 

I had a regular carne asada burrito (around $6) and a Pacifico ($2 all weekend) and was in heaven. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the pico was fresh and added a crispness that was really nice, and the onions were caramelized well. I can't wait until the fall to make use of the patio and take better advantage of the cheap beers all weekend."}
{"text":"Ok, folks...Don't hate on America's just because you don't know what to order or what stuff is or...you have \"expectations\" that are completely americanized and out of whack anyways (You've been hitting chipotle, TB and baja WAY too much!).  Keep an open mind and walk in expecting the unexpected.  If you want processed, \"americanized\" Mexican fast food or chicken...as another reviewer said:  Go to Taco Bell in the MU or hit Baja Fresh up the Street.  If you want pretty authentic, tasty, and delicious mexican food (esp carne asada), then def give the place a try with an open mind.  Look past the fact that it's small, has a small menu, and you might not know what some of the stuff is and JUST TRY IT.  

Sorry...but I've gotta stick up for these folks and for small business owners.  I'm not going to lie - I hadn't gotten past the carne asada burrito and the guac before today because they are both just so freaking good!  But I finally got to try their shrimp ceviche today (only served on Fridays and Saturdays)...And all in all, I have to say that it was pretty darned good.  The carne asada, though, is awesome and worth the trip. It's not greasy or fatty and it's so flavorful and tender, it's just beyond YUMMY.  I honestly have trouble putting it down because it is THAT good.  The guac is really fresh and tasty...and the salsa is also very yummy (although I could go for a bit more bite to it!).  The ceviche was good too, but not as good as the carne asada.

The menu is small for a reason:  think five guys, the chuck box, and some of the other joints that do a couple of things and do them WELL.  That's exactly what America's does.  Give 'em a try...I personally think they're a great addition to that whole area and I hope they are successful! 

 (for the folks who didn't know the difference btwn a quesadilla and vampiro - don't blame the restaurant for your ignorance)."}
{"text":"Just left this place, By far the worst burrito I have ever had. I tried the El pastor burrito and it just tasted like leftovers. Leftover meat, leftover salad, leftover pineapples, it was pretty gross I didn't even finish the whole thing. Also, it's pretty pricey for the quality of the food, $6 for a burrito that's smaller than the average Taco Bell bean burrito? I don't think so, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"So I've driven past this place a bunch of times and finally decided to stop in and see what it was all about.

At best, it was absolutely middle-of-the-road.  I had the combo #1 (one of each taco type).  When I got home, I opened the bag and found a single ball of tinfoil about half the size of my hand, crunched up around all 3 tacos, and that was it.  The thing that was funny to me is that the combo includes NOTHING but the tacos, and is only priced about 10 cents lower than just ordering the damn tacos a la carte, so what's the point of even calling it a \"combo\"?

As for the actual food, it was nothing special whatsoever.  It was basically the same as tacos al carbon from del taco, but at twice the price and all mashed together instead of being individually wrapped (I mean, c'mon guys, is tinfoil *that* expensive these days?)

I was really hoping this would become a favorite place since it's so close by, but the whole experience was the exact opposite of what i was expecting.  In my opinion, $7+ for 5.5 oz of mediocre food is not a compelling reason to return - it's freakin chain taco shop, not some foofy French restaurant.

In the end, it wasn't horrible (thus I'm giving it more than 1 star - the place looked clean and I didn't spot any food service shenanigans), but definitely not compelling enough to bring this place past 2 stars.  Sorry, America's but that's as generous as I can be - I won't be back."}
{"text":"Gotta give them five stars because they are always so accommodating when I want to vegan-ize my burrito. A Mexican coke and a spicy burro are a perfect for the weekends."}
{"text":"I love their online order feature.. Comes in handy especially when I only have a 30 minute lunch and I'm across the street.. Great customer service and great tasting food"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian and lover of creative tacos, America's is my jam. Where else can you get grilled pineapple and potato in the same taco?

While my experiences have been mostly good, last time I went with my boyfriend he really came up on the short end of the stick. There was a verbal miscommunication between him and the cashier, and she wound up ordering the wrong burrito for him.
It would have been a different story if he got the wrong burrito in a timely manner, however, my tacos came promptly and by the time I was almost done eating, his burrito was still totally MIA.
Finally, an employee stopped by and asked us if he had gotten his \"enter-food-he-did-not-order-here.\" After correcting the employee on his order, she informed him that what he had paid for was more expensive than what he was going to get.
\"Is that okay?\" she asked. But when is it really okay to pay for more less? My answer: never.

With him being the perfect gentleman, he said it was okay.

But I guess the $2 Pacifico helped ease our pain."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to stop in and definitely do not regret it. I'm glad I found a solid little taco shop close to our place because two hippies just aint cuttin it. I had the pastor tacos and carne asada tacos and they were both delicious. Very homemade authentic taste and ingredients. The staff was friendly and helpful. Can't wait to head back for more!"}
{"text":"Very commercial. A lot like a Baja Fresh or chipotle. Not bad though. Food was decent"}
{"text":"Have been here twice now. Plus- it's in my neighborhood and I can hit up a few antique shops of awesomeness. 
Negatives- parking, canned diet coke and small burritos for the price. 

It's a hip place and I like the outdoor seating but the food isn't something I crave."}
{"text":"Not impressed, the carne asada tacos aren't that good. Tough meat and not very tasty."}
{"text":"ATS is amazing!  I eat here often, and every time I come away happy.  The menu is simple, which means they can focus on doing the food very  well.  The ingredients are high quality, and it really shows in their use of fresh produce, and great guacamole.  The staff is extremely friendly, and even during the dinner rush, the food comes out in a reasonable amount of time.  They truly have the best carne asada in town, but don't count out the pastor.  It is tender, and so delicious with the pastor spices, and pineapple.  I prefer it in burrito form, but the tacos are amazing too.  Their tortas are great, the vampiros very interesting, and their beans, vegetarian.  We love their salsa as well.  Grab a Pacifico or a Three Amigos Marg and sit under the misters.  Or call in your order, ask what the daily special is, and pick up in 10 to 15 minutes.  Always fresh, always tasty.  Thanks ATS!"}
{"text":"I stopped by after work, having heard about the flagship taco shop years ago, then recently the franchise action. I wish I had tried the original so I had a baseline comparison, but alas.  The food was not bad, but not amazing. What struck me was that it was pretty clearly overpriced. I had one of each of the tacos, some in the shop, some to go. They were not memorable, so I can't tell you much about them. The carne asada tacos at Los Taquitos on Elliot and 48th were a million times better and super cheap. I will say, the service was way above par and I wish I knew the girl's name so I could recommend her for a promotion. Well done and thank you."}
{"text":"I usually only give 1 star to places so I guess that means I'd go back right? yea- I'd go back I guess. \"BEST\" carne asada burrito???? I dunno???....... we thought about it and the meat WAS good. BUT its too pricey. we bought 2 carne asada burritos (not very big BTW), ceviche, 2 beers and it was $28 bux. dude- that is too expensive for a taco shop. the ceviche was NO good. like- at all. don't order it. Next time, yes- Next time, I'm gonna order just carne asada TACOS and see if I like it better."}
{"text":"The service here is disgusting! Spent over an hour waiting for my food. Just to find out the cashier never placed my order to the cooks! All they did for me was give me a cheap apology. I will never come back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burrito and chicken taco combo and was pleasantly surprised. The bean burrito was really great. I loved the salsa. Mild with just enough spices. Great food! I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"I loved this place! It is on 7th st north of palm lane. I ordered the quesadilla vegetariana and my bf got the carne asada tacos. They were delicous!! I will definitely be coming back and letting all my friends and family know of this place.  Really good food and really nice atmosphere, the staff was so nice and friendly. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What the heck are all you guys raving about? This place is okay.. Meat is tender that's about it. Tacos lack flavor and heat.. Two major parts.. I don't know what food you are comparing this to. I read lots of good yelps so decided to try this place. Had it the first time and thought it was a little bland. Now just took my girl here and got a few things to try more on menu.  And all I can say it was not gross but far from a good taco let alone best in phx"}
{"text":"Great little homey (it's literally in an old converted home) taco shop.  Ate there for lunch before going to a busy all-day event at the Phoenix Convention Center, and couldn't go wrong with ordering three of their beef tacos.  Paired it with a delicious Mexican Coke in a bottle to make for a great lunch.  Highly recommend this place if you're in the downtown area, it's worth the little drive to it.  Arguably some of the best tacos in town."}
{"text":"I love the carne asada burrito it is the best I have ever had!!!  It comes with a slice of lime, radish and a homemade salsa that is great.  I order an xl carne asada burrito because the normal carne asada burrito is just a wee bit to small for me.  This is the Cadillac of carne asada burritos the meat is great has a nice char to it and yet still juicy.  The homemade horchata (mexican drink) is on point and has my girlfriend hooked.  What also is great is that unlike those other Mexican quick food places you can grab a Mexican beer, Margarita and they even have Mexican bottled Coca Cola made from real sugar rather than our high-fructose corn syrup Coca Cola we get in the good ol' U.S of A.  This place has been added to my list of regular grub spots.  

This is another downtown spot that was previously someones home.  I am still not used to the squeaking sound that the floors of these old houses turned into a business make when you walk on them.  I sometimes feel like my big self is going to fall through like you see on cartoons.  The dining area is small.  If you have a group I would suggest you have someone snag a table because bye the time you order there might not be somewhere to sit.  The place can fill up quick.  Hey but that is the charm of these places downtown.  If you don't like it go to the burbs."}
{"text":"I really don't get why everyone is raving this place.  I've been here twice and ordered the carne asada burrito.  The portions are really small for the price that they charge.  There is too much tortilla for the meat.  I think this place is overrated and that there are better places for carne asada in the valley."}
{"text":"I gave it two stars because the people were friendly and the service was fast. The food, however, was gross. The carne asada was burnt and dry. The cheese quesadilla was so disgusting I took one bite and spit it out. Waste of money. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"Amazing service! SUPER friendly and they make you feel like family. The food was delicious! We had the chicken nachos. Great flavor and good quality chicken. The bean and cheese burrito was PACKED with bean and cheese which was a nice fill up but kind of messy lol get utensils and napkins lol can't wait to come back and try more of what is on the menu!"}
{"text":"This place was utterly disappointing. While visiting friends in Tempe, we decided to try this place out. This place claimed to be \"authentic\" therefore they didn't serve rice and used white beans. Where in Mexico do they NOT serve rice and brown beans? To top it off, the portions were sooooo small. I paid almost 4.00 for a vampira which was seriously smaller than five inches in diameter. The kids menu was also disappointing. They finished their food in 2-3 bites. I paid $28 dollars for appetizers that were LESS than mediocre.  Dinner at Taco Bell would have been more fulfilling and CHEAPER.!! We are all off to Sonic to eat dinner. DEF not Americas Taco Shop. The staff was also quite rude."}
{"text":"This was a learning experience. I learned that we are in Phoenix and should never friend on an American taco. The place is a mild variation on baja fresh and the food is awful. It is a horrible attempt to match the local tacos but fails miserably. This was definitely my first and last time here."}
{"text":"I love America's Taco Shop and used to go to the one on university, until this location opened up. The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is always clean. I always get the bean and cheese burrito and chips and salsa trio! Both are delicious and always hit the spot. I definitely recommend this place and go here often with my friends. So good!!"}
{"text":"America's is a chain, and it's a good chain - don't get me wrong, but this place gets 5 stars for a different reason.  There's a guy here (I assume it's the manager, but I could be wrong) who just really takes care of people. Like, he's friendly, comes to check on you while you're eating, gets you things if you need them - it's just a higher level of service.  Hell - it's better customer service than I get at many classier places.  I've only been here like, 3 times, but he's always there and helpful!

Anyway, America's is awesome (try the chips and guac, and an Al Pastor taco), and I recommend it, and this location is awesome."}
{"text":"I don't care if it's a chain - America's is fantastic.

First off, they have beer, margaritas, and tequila. That's great.
Secondly, they're fast.  Like, bring a group for lunch at 12:00 and get back with time to spare before your 1:00 meeting.
Third, they're friendly and helpful.  Don't get me wrong, if you go in there like a big fat jerk and start complaining about things, I hope they punch you in the throat, but if you place your order with a smile, they take it with a smile, and check in you while you're eating to make sure you don't need salsas or chips, and get your garbage out of your way.
Finally, the food is pretty good.  Incredible?  No.  But tasty and fresh, and they don't charge you an arm and a leg.  I get a burrito, chips, and salsa, and spend about $6."}
{"text":"This was the most disgusting burrito I've ever eaten. The tortilla, beans, and cheese were all the same color. It tastes like absolutely nothing. Cannot believe I paid for this"}
{"text":"Solid carne asada. Not quite as good as the one on 7th Street. I think once the grill at this location gets more use and becomes seasoned, it will improve considerably. 
On the plus side, the soda machine is incredible! 
Great for a quick lunch if you live in No. Scottsdale."}
{"text":"New Taco shops seem to be opening at a fast clip and America's stands out as one of the best. We absolutely love the quesadilla and the  tacos. The corn is also a must have. 

If you go with two people, don't miss their meal for two deal that includes two drinks. 

We can't wait until their 7th Ave store opens in January. Hopefully the quality will stay the same."}
{"text":"First time at America's was a great experience. Friendly staff and very quick service. The patio looked very nice, but it was a little too cold so we sat inside. They did a great job converting this old home into a nice cozy restaurant. I had the Al Pastor (marinated pork) burrito and it was delicious. The chips and salsa were terrific as well. I only wish they were open later than 9pm (10p on the weekends). We need some quality late night eateries in AZ."}
{"text":"The gentleman that took our order was great, but once we picked our order up we noticed some items were missing and wrong. After being ignored for a minute by a girl who was just standing around, she came over and I politely told her what was wrong. She rolled her eyes and then went to the back and complained to the guy who took our order. He showed her that she made an error on the ticket. She took her sweet time to remake it. Really bad attitude. The Al Pastor we ordered had to be changed because it was going to take 15 minutes to make. The chips were very stale. The tacos however were just okay. Disappointing for the price."}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada tacos from the 1st level stand at Chase Field. It took about 5 minutes to get back to our seats and they were cold. Not warm or kind of warm. Cold. And they were absolutely tasteless as well, even covered in salsa."}
{"text":"You got to try this place! I ordered America's Way burrito vegan and it was so much more than I expected that I had to give it 5 stars.

So, they use Mayocoba beans which I was introduced to today. They are delicious and since I eat beans daily, someone who teaches me about a great new bean is a friend in my book.

Its a nothing fancy place with a ping pong table outside. So dont expect white tablecloths, but get ready for great flavors. My meal was like $7 total. Can't beat that price!"}
{"text":"I place a phone order twice a week from this location and today am told they have never accepted phone order and denied my business. They usually mess up your order anyway. If they don't want my money then I don't think I will be giving them any more of it.."}
{"text":"Just visited the place for the first time and it was eh. The food was good and the prices were good, just very small portions. I got the quesadilla and it was delicious, but it took me about 5 bites and it was gone! 
As everyone says, the carne asada was tasty, but my boyfriend and his friend complained of tiny size also.
The people there were kind and we didn't have to wait too long, but we are all still hungry. I guess we're used to gigantic food servings."}
{"text":"Tacos are OK. Mine are better.  And are you charging me for a roasted jalapeno? Are you serious! Come on I will go to Safeway and donate them to you. Don't be so cheap you won't go broke. Also get rid of the Blondie cashier to dreamy and tell the gringos in the back to speed it up we are hungry out here. The order is to go no for us to go and shop and come back to pick it up. Work faster America otherwise we are going across the street."}
{"text":"Worst mexican meal I've ever had, the burrito was a flour tortilla wrapped around bean goo. They gave me a tiny portion of salsa in a jello shot cup that got me through about a quarter of the burrito which is about all I ate before tossing it all in disgust. To to top it off they have no liquor licence so no beer to chase away the taste. If I was starving and they were the only place open ,I would just continue to starve."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada burrito. It was pretty close to the best carne asada I have ever had. The service was great and speedy. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"There is no option to give zero or negative star rating. 

We have eaten at the 7th location and lost our minds at how great the food was. Found it from some vlogger's post on his quest for perfect taco. And they were perfect!

We moved and now this location is closer. Finally had time to try it tonight. 

Another reviewer has it correct, a sterile environment. You could tell me I was in a Subway, and I'd believe you. The table layout is awkward and we couldn't find a comfortable place to relax. Opted for the bar seating. 

I don't often order fountain drinks... their way cool machine looks great, but the mix is off. My soda was not flat, but just tasted funky. 

It took forever to get our food. A regular burrito al pastor, a taco al pastor and a carne asana taco. Not the most complex things to slap together. 

The burrito, the $6 burrito, was smaller then a Taco Bell bean and cheese burro. The two tacos, cheaper than burro we're both bigger. The meat in all three was cold. I'm talking chilly. No, it was not from the cold topping, it was flat out, against health code cold! 

Took two bite of burro and realized it was half gone, felt stupid. So, got the guts to go back to register and ask for something else. The cashier had nothing but excuses. \"We portion control\" \"Meat is cold from the toppings\" \"Do you have your receipt?\" I guess because it took 20 minutes to get food, they could have forgotten we were recently up there....

Then asked if I wanted something else or money back. I opted for money back. No offer of a substitute on the house. No apology. 

Finally, one of the employees came out to inquire about our little food complaint. He did ask if we wanted something else, or a taco for the road. He offered an explanation (another excuse or explanation....) they were training a new person, that's why it was cold. Okay. Whatever. 

Sooooo very disappointing. Not America's best. Sad sad sad."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that their food is really good! I love their carne asada tortas and carne asada tacos.... a little on the pricey side and small portions. Food does not equal a great dining experience.

However when it comes to customer service they suck! The girls who work the front counter always seem to have an attitude, I don't know if it is family that works there but they need to have meetings with their staff on how to deal with customers and have better attitudes. Customers are the ones who keep them in business.

The last time my boyfriend and I were there was back in October, we have not been back since (WE USE TO go at least 2 times a week). After catching an evening movie down town we went to Americas to grab a bite to eat, staff was not friendly as we walked in, then we went to sit out in their patio (north side of building). They have green plastic chairs, as my boyfriend went to sit down the leg of the chair just broke off and he fell backwards hitting his head on the wooden post. Mind you, he is not a huge man, 6' 3\" 200lbs. He was more than embarrased since other people were outside and his head and hand were a little sore with the fall, we also noticed there was a broken chair sitting against back wall (leg broken off- Really? Shocker! Not!) After talking for a bit we figured with the wear and tear of weather the chairs were probably getting brittle and getting weak. A staff member came out a few minutes later with our food and asked if everything was ok, it seemed like he was insinuating he knew what happened but did not come right out and say so (They have windows right next to where it happened). My boyfriend told him the whole story and said we noticed the other chair and if it happened before they should have checked all the chairs because it could have happened to a child, pregnant woman or a heavier individual and the outcome could have been worse. The guy did not know what to say or do... he did not offer to pay for our meal or give us anything on the house and kept saying we could go to the hospital if we needed to. We asked for the manager/owner, he said he was out of town. So we asked for a contact number or email address. He gave us both. 

The next day my boyfriend emailed the owner, he said he was out of town and sorry for what happened and would take care of us as soon as he got back in town in a couple of days..... it has been 4 months and we never heard back from him?!?....... WOW, way to go in customer service and pleasing the customer. Guess that is where his staff gets it from.

Hopefully they are keeping an eye on those chairs so it wont happen again, to YOU the CUSTOMER.... beware of the green chairs!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok this is the BEST Carne Asada I have ever eaten! Granted I am from the midwest so I thought Taco Bell was good Mexican before I moved to AZ but DAMN!
The recipe (an old family one of the owner's) is amazing and very flavorfull.

Try the burrito, but get something on the side as it needs an extra bit to fill you up. Don't get me wrong this is not the Overstuffed Burrito that you find at Chipotle that gets super messy and in my opinion is not very good. No this burrito is well propotioned as a meal and easy to eat. Not too messy or anything.

Also the Civeche is really great too, very fresh and crisp.
The only reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that it is kinda small. That's all. 

Hell I give them 5 in my heart!"}
{"text":"Tried take-out on 7th Ave a second time after being letdown the first time. Four fatty tacos, a skinny burro and some nasty corn later, I'm now totally letdown. I was complaining to my daughter that they forgot my carne asada burro. I saw a flour tortilla and thought it came with my beans. Lo and behold that was my burro. I actually measured the carne asada because I was pretty bent. We came up with less than 3 tbls of filling. That was one empty tortilla. I had two people spitting fat into a napkin with the pastor tacos. The corn was a cold cob swimming in some nasty looking and smelling white stuff. No wonder the girl at the counter asked me twice if I wanted it. Thankfully I can go back to Los Compadres where I've gone for years."}
{"text":"Last season we ate once or twice a week at America's taco shop and the food was consistent,  tasty and a good value compared to most other concession stands at chase field.  Tonight I got the bean and cheese burrito and it was tasteless and much of the tortilla was crispy...either stale or too long under the heat lamp.  My husband got the chicken tacos.  As he picked each one up, it fell apart in his hand...another example of stale tortillas.  The chicken was also tasteless.

Chase field strikes out again for concession food!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with my Mom and found the place to be quite remarkable. We were greeted warmly and told to sit anywhere. Ordered up tacos, two each, chicken, pork and carne asada.  Street taco size and very tasty. Mom had tacos as well and as this was just a way of killing some time we did not sit for a full meal. I will be coming back, soon as time allows to experience more of this wonderful little shop. Had no trouble parking right in the driveway. I asked inside and was told it would be alright."}
{"text":"The al pastor is fantastic! The Carne asada was good.. And the chicken was OK.. Definitely recommend the al pastor taco, burrito, however you want it :)"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer of this location, for the last couple years. I would say that I come on average at least 2x week. I have noticed a gradual decline in the overall experience. 
In the last 2 months, THREE times I went to this location to get a breakfast burrito, only to be told they didn't have potatoes. Today, I was told they were out of potatoes AND chorizo!!! 
A few weeks back, I went in for lunch and they said that didn't have burritos!!! Apparently they were out of large flour tortillas. 
Imagine going to an ice cream parlor to get an ice cream cone and being told you couldn't get a cone because they were out of cones. 
For whatever reason, this location does NOT know how to order properly or manage their inventory in such a way as to provide the most basic items to customers. I've grown frustrated and tired of the customer \"NO service\" shown and will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the tacos al pastor! The refried beans are pretty good, too. Fiance loves their carne asada, and I think it's pretty good, too, but I just can't shake the pastor addiction! Oh, and I love America's corn - covered in mayo, cotija cheese, and served with lime!"}
{"text":"I can't stop eating here.  I've gone 4 times this past week alone!"}
{"text":"Got a burrito for $6 + and it was all guacamole and pico with barley and carne asada. It was cold and disgusting. This place should be embarrassed to serve their food."}
{"text":"Overpriced for okay food.  I don't get it.  Slow service--not the food, but placing your order takes forever.  Also, don't be fooled by the two sizes--you'll want the bigger one for a normal meal."}
{"text":"Went to this location on 8/8/13. Extremely slow service. Only one of the three cash registers was open. I stood and waited for over 5 minutes and the entire time there was only one customer in front of me. There were 4 employees that were near counter and talking but none of them came to help me. I looked over multiple times to the group which I believe included 2 managers and still no acknowledgement. Finally I just decided to walk out. I really liked Baja Fresh which used to be in this location. The employees before seemed much more competent and friendly. Definitely a very disappointing first impression."}
{"text":"Terrible. If I could give zero stars I would. Cold tacos. Tough pork in the pastor. Over charred Carne Asada. And old tasting guacamole with a piece of the kitchen equipment in it. Flavorless salsa. Another odd thing is that they don't offer hot coffee. The girl said that they brew it And then refrigerate it for iced coffee, I suspect it was just yesterday's coffee. This place used to be so good and has been steadily going downhill. This last visit sealed my desire to never return. Too bad Americas, you had so much potential once upon a time."}
{"text":"Okay, I live in the Melrose district and try to frequent the local businesses whenever I can to support my 'hood.... but I think that I've marked America's off my personal  \"patronize\" list. 

Went today for the first time in about a month for carne asada burritos, and a Mexican Coke. Burritos were, well, limp AND lame. No real flavor, no spicy \"kick\", and kinda mushy and just overall bland. 

Service was very matter-of-fact and not friendly in the least - are all of the employees at the 7th Avenue location unhappy with their jobs or are they just \"salty\" on Sundays because they're hung-over from Saturday night. No, really.... borderline rude service and the place was not overly busy or crowded.  

As the previous Yelper mentioned, parking is indeed a bitch as times - just park on the side street - it's much easier than America's lot.  

Final thing - this place is kinda pricey given the portion size - which has also been previously mentioned by others. It seems to be that portion size is getting SMALLER over the past 3 or 4 months. Cost-cutting, perhaps?? If so, it's really degrading the product."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a breakfast burrito and some chips and guacamole. When my husband went to pick it up this morning 10 min after they opened he found that they were really not ready to open.  After ringing him up for everything they  said it would be 15 min to make the guac because it hadn't been made yet. He said he couldn't wait so to just credit him back. They said they couldn't cause a manager wasn't there. What manager wouldn't open the store...ugh! So when we called later to see if they had credit the card back we waited on hold for 5 min then called back to wait more. Honestly, the burrito was good but not worth the unprofessionalism that this place showed! I would have rather gone to a berto's drive thru. Maybe they will hire a better staff and we will go back someday. Oh well!"}
{"text":"If you just want good tacos and not a fancy sit-down then this a great place.  It always hits the spot for my greasy sinful cravings. :)"}
{"text":"The truth is I was really disappointed. The guacamole is grosse. The burritos are tiny for the price they have and the flavor very weak. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try this place on our way home from running errands one night, since we love Mexican food. We both got the special, a pastor burrito and the chips and salsa trio to share. Signs all over state that the food is fresh, it took her like 2 minutes to make our food. After we got home we were very surprised at how small the burritos were, about the size of a bean and cheese burrito from Taco Bell. For the size I think it was a little over priced and for the quality we received. And my boyfriend thought his burrito was super salty. I thought the pastor was a little dry. It wasn't terrible food but there was nothing special about the food. Nothing that makes me want to return. I was expecting something more and it was a let down. I most likely will never return here."}
{"text":"Love the carne asada tacos.  The place is clean, staff is friendly and they have one of those nifty coke machines where you have 1000's of mixing choices.  We've been there several times already and plan to return."}
{"text":"this location has been closed!!! 

the property has a large for-sale sign on it!!"}
{"text":"Love the location and the re-purposed historical house 
Stoked that the tortillas are fully warmed like a good tortilla should be. 
Crave the creamy, non-lard beans even more than the carne asada. 
Diggin the outdoor picnic tables. 
Hesitant to order the corn because sometimes it has too much sauce n cheese, which overpower the pure joy of grilled corn. 
Not so crazy about my last experience where the cashiers showed more personality talking to each other or the kitchen crew than they did to me while taking my order. I'm paying $6 for a burrito, could it hurt to smile and maybe offer me a happy hour beer when I'm here picking up my take out dinner?"}
{"text":"very cute shop inside an old house in oldtown.  clean comfy atmosphere, beautiful patio.  service was friendly and efficient.  Drawback: no fountain sodas or fresh brewed iced tea...all cans.  expensive cans. $1.50 for can of diet coke

.  however, they do serve beer and tquila.  The best chips and salsa i have ever had.  i could eat the salsa with a spoon as a meal.  it was so flavorfil, with just the right kick of heat.  great lunch spot...my coworkers are addicted..."}
{"text":"We first went here when they first opened and the food was great, each time we have gone back it has gotten worse. The only consistently good thing is the carne asada, everything else is bland and a waste of money. On our last visit Today, the salsa was old, smelled sour and had an off taste.

Worst part of this trip was the cashier. Since the cashier is the customer facing part of your business, I would think you would want to have a friendly, welcoming person in this role. The person working Today was the exact opposite, maybe she was forced to eat the salsa.

Step your game up, plenty of cheaper places with better food in Mesa to grab this type of food. If I wanted mediocre food and crappy service I would have just gone to my Mother in Law's house."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the burritos. Carne Asada, Pastor and Bean & Cheese. The place is usually really crowded around lunch time on the weekdays."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great prices. Worth the walk in old town Scottsdale. The guacamole is so good. Order it on the side. Has screens to view sports for you enthusiasts. Love it."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place  for taco.  My favorite thing to order is the taco al pastor, pork served with a slice of pineapple.  I have also had the carne asada which is excellent, too.  I love this place and come here about once a week.  Their patio is lovely when the weather is decent.

The horchata is solid.  I would like the horchat more if it was a little less bland (maybe a pinch more cinnamon?) but that's a minor quibble.

America's Taco Shop is pretty inexpensive but for being a taco shop, I wish the prices were more reasonable especially for the beverages and sides.  The first time I went I got a little too excited when I saw the Mexican Coke on the menu so I impulsively ordered it but was then shocked when it rang up as $3 (which costs more than a taco, yipes).  Serves me right, I guess...  Chips and guacamole are also $4.95."}
{"text":"Some of my favorite fast food Mexican.  Food is consistently good. Love the bowls."}
{"text":"So yummy!   At least, the ONE thing on the menu I can eat because I'm a vegetarian.   Bean & cheese burrito.   With plenty-o-beer.  This place is stumble-home distance for me, so happy it's there.  Staff super friendly.   Although the menu is limited for me, my friends who eat meat all raved about their selections, and I have to admit it all SMELLED good. 

Inexpensive.  Casual.  Fun.  Friendly.   Welcoming.    In my 'hood.  My favorite kinda place!"}
{"text":"I was so excited!!! I just couldn't hide it!!! 

Why you ask? Well, I was excited when I heard this location was opening. You see I live close by and geeezzz I loved the other locations. The other locations offered an amazing product with addictive flavors and unparalleled passion for detail and consistency. 

Then my excitement faded. It has taken me a long time to write this review because I kept my hopes alive - time after time and try after try. After 15 or so attempts at this sterile location I finally throw In the towel... I quit all the things... 

I accept my last stage of grief. 

15 or so visits and not once has the flavor or experience been even sort of reminiscent of the original taco shops. Nothing tastes the same. Seriously, every time you go.

You can order the same thing and it tastes like a completely different place. Even the guacamole!!! Every thing is even made differently each time. Tortillas are filled different rolled fm different. It's just strange. 
Isn't there a recipe? 

You can feel the difference. No care or attention to detail. 

It's like the had an authentic amazing grandma with great recipe and passion and fired her just to replace her with someone from Taco Bell. 

And that is being nice because at least with the bell you know what it's gonna taste like. Not like I would eat there either but still.  Anyways. Sorry if this is harsh but by golly.., you had magic in a bottle and I'm disappointed that it seems like the bottle was packaged sold and then it forgot where it came from. 

P.s. I gave it two star because it still hurts. I Love You!"}
{"text":"Holy burito batman! This place is ama-za-zing! Great place to go, sit out side, have a drink an eat some delicious Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now. Don't order anything for takeout, food tastes terrible once it gets cold. Their guacamole is a green paste so I'd highly suggest not eating it or ask for it on the side. It's a decent taco spot but there's better options out there."}
{"text":"I always enjoy americas taco shop. This location the food is always good but the morning crew is very rude and unaccomodating. I've had no issues with the afternoon crew."}
{"text":"They are very nice here and have a dog friendly patio too. The young lady brought the puppies water. The food is good and they have a fine margarita."}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop is definitely one of the best taco shops in Tempe. As an avid Mexican food consumer, I would highly recommend America's as one of the best, most authentic taco shops in town. 

In terms of food, I would personally recommend getting the Al Pastor. The pork and pineapple blend is out of this world. Their guacamole is also incredibly fresh and worth the price. 

Literally the only reasons why I don't give this place 5 stars is because I wish it had more available seating during the day. I also think they should be open 24/7 but that's just me! 

Also, if you work in the area and want to throw an awesome work party or something, place your order online. It will save you lots of hassle."}
{"text":"Americas was good and I would go back. I wasn't blown away by the tacos but my kids loved their dish and my wifes meal was really good. If you are driving by and you are hungry it is definitely worth checking out. Ask the staff what they recommend."}
{"text":"Not impressed... have had way better food from a street side taco shop for far less money $25 for 3 tacos and one quesadilla"}
{"text":"All I'll say is...wow.  This place was SO bad! Maybe we came at a bad time, on the weekend when the area is dead but everything we ordered, tacos, burrito, quesadilla, chips...were all terrible. I don't give out that opinion lightly but the food was all cold with NO flavor at all. We even ordered everything spicy and it was so bland. Very disappointed will not be returning."}
{"text":"It's a great place to eat. If you are going there for lunch make sure to call your order in before you go, they get busy at lunch..."}
{"text":"They have awesome guacamole and good burritos. The atmosphere makes you feel like you are eating in a small taco shack on the beach. Staff is normally friendly. 
Cons: No where to park and it is always super crowded."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend to try something besides Filiberto's for once.  We should have stuck to Filiberto's.  This place charges way more for a burrito that was nowhere near as large or delicious.  

We both got bean and cheese burritos, deciding against the guacamole because they charge $1 extra for it.  Most places it is half that.  We also found that rice is not an option.

When we got home, we found that our burritos were puny, floppy and understuffed.  They were reasonably tasty, but definitely not filling.  I could have eaten two of them, and I'm a light eater.

Definitely disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Carne Asada how it was meant to be eaten. The carne asada here is great. While Americas Taco Shop is not the most authentic, they have created excellent carne asada tortas and vampiros. If you go here and order chips & salsa, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy, and it tastes great. Parking can be scarce in the small lot behind the restaurant, so parking down the street on a side street may be your best bet."}
{"text":"Whoa! I didn't know this location existed! And it's closer to me :D
I already reviewed the other America's.
I love this place.
What a difference in staff. 
Although I have seen some people who work at both locations.

And for those of you that need to be corrected. It's not America's taco shop as in USA.
The owner's name is America.

As I mentioned on the other review. I'm hella picky when it comes to Mexican food since I am Hispanic.
Finally finally found a place that meets my high standards."}
{"text":"We walked into Halo (piercing shop downtown) and they handed us some pamphlets...
One of them was a map with all the cool/hip spots downtown and we realized we hadn't been to many of them. So we Decided to go to all of the ones listed and cross em out.
And, this was our first stop. 

I'm gonna start off by saying how much i like the vibe of this place, especially the outside seating on a sunny day.
The food was so yummy.
And, I normally don't like going to eat Mexican food other than my own Mom's kitchen because I am Hispanic and extremely picky.

I really love their carne tacos and quesadillas..
Their beans(lard free) are my favorite. 
The horchata is not that powdery crap.
It's home made. 
I really do love this place.
I've been here a few times already and also brought my parents who loved the place as well.

The only thing I will say is that -if you want to get completely full, it is a bit pricey.

I tend to crave this food a lot, and I'm glad I finally found a lil taco shop that met my standards.


Way to go America!"}
{"text":"Ordered the following items: 1 Al Pastor Taco, 1 Carne Asada Taco, 1 Al Pastor Quesadilla and 1 Carne Asada Burrito. Also got the Cochatta drink.

Al Pastor items:
Great flavor and seasoning on the meat and the addition of grilled pineapple really perked up the dish. Food was not greasy or overbearing fatty. very very good
.
Carne Asada: I have eaten Carne Asada at many many restaurants and this was some of the best. Smoky flavor but still juicy and not dry. I am sure that as the grill seasons over time this Carne Asada will get even better

Cochatta: Mixture of ice coffee and Horchata. Cuts the acidity of the coffee and adds a nice sweet cinnamon flavor without being overbearing. Great Drink.

Overall I was impressed with the online ordering system, speed of food construction, and taste of the food. This place has replaced Chipotle and Fillaburtos as our quick Mexican food place of choice."}
{"text":"Overall I liked this place and glad it is in the neighborhood.  The carne asada burrito was good and the ceviche was pretty tasty.  However, it seems that this is about all there is to the menu.  

I was not a fan of the set-up of the restaurant.  It was way too crowded - yes it was lunch, but the flow could have been a lot better.  Overall, I will return when in the mood for carne asada.  Hopefully the kinks will get worked out over time and until then I look forward to supporting a local restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been three times and had an overall okay experience.  The vampiro was interesting.  Prices are nothing special, service is decent but again unremarkable.  The Al Pastor burritos/tacos I tried did stand out as especially tasty.  I've heard the ceviche is worth trying."}
{"text":"The food prices were reasonable and were authentic Mexican dishes. Portions were beautiful in size and wonderfully flavored. The staff was helpful and the food was quickly served on your desk. Highly recommend. Everything was very fast."}
{"text":"the tacos are really good and clean, i appreciate that they don't use lard in their beans..which are excellent. try the vampiros, that's the menu masterpiece...highly  recommend the pastor vampiro. the only reason this place doesn't get the 5 stars is that both locations (7th street and 7th ave) are chronically out of tequila--they've got a great margarita, you can just rarely actually order one cause they can't or don't keep ingredients in stock. same with their beers--they are always on the verge of being out...they should get it together or let folks BYOB...nothing more annoying than to cab it out there planning on a marg and realize you wasted the fare"}
{"text":"I don't know, if you want tacos then go to a Mexican place, if you want American go to an American restaurant. This place does have beer and margaritas, but that doesn't make a good restuarant. Cute, not clean, busy, and crowded. But the food frankly lacks any inspiration. Most boring bean burrito I've had, reminded me of a supermarket microwave burrito. Machaca tostado was OK, the tacos al Pastor were totally lacking in flavor. Salsas were a huge disappointment. Go to a Mexican restaurant for better Mexican food."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos from America's are my go-to when I need a quick and hearty breakfast on a Sunday morning. My favorite is the chorizo with potato and egg, but the carne asada breakfast burrito is a close second. The restaurant is within walking distance from my house, so I stop in at least once a month. They are always super friendly and super fast. Don't ever change, America's!"}
{"text":"Workers to busy texting. Took forever to get my burrito. When I did get it, the tortilla was dry and the lettuce was old. Meat was also dry. Didn't seem fresh at all. Overpriced for the small amount of food you get."}
{"text":"We shared a chicken burito.  Great flavor and served with tomatillo sauce. You could tell that the ingredients were fresh! The owner was great and brought us a sample of guacamole with chips! Great service."}
{"text":"Authentic asada in a great setting.  This is a great place to grab a great carne asada.  We went in the evening around 8 and had a burrito, tostada and bean burrito between us.  Everything was good and fresh.  

The ambience is nice with lots of outside seating.  

I understand this place gets busy at lunch and even at 8pm there was a short queue!"}
{"text":"Watched the Fiesta Bowl Parade today. Decided to stop at America's Taco Shop on the way home for a quick bite. Have to say that I was disappointed. The food had almost no flavor. The Carne Asada tasted like lime juice and the Al Pastor taco was overpowered by the mango.

I have definitely had better."}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop knows how to make some darn good carne asada. You can't go wrong here if you order anything with carne asada. They recently started offering chicken too. The bean and cheese burrito is delicious if you're looking for a meatless option. Daily specials, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. My only complaint is that the tortilla chips aren't very good--often taste a little stale. If you get them, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy and it's a big improvement over the regular salsa. The \"cochata\"--coffee + Horchata--is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great Mexican, but I mostly come here for the muy autentico jamaica and horchata!  Try them both!"}
{"text":"The worst service and tacos I ever had. I ordered 2 carne asada tacos. It was 1240pm and not too busy. It took 20mins to make 2 tacos. Then the only flavor the meat had was burnt taste. No flavor! The lettuce was like a wet paste. This did not enhance the flavor. Thank goodness for the hot salsa or my 2 tacos would have been 2 tasteless corn tortillas of mush. They had a big grill but the cook apparently could only cook 1 order at a time. Hey buddy, put all the quesadillas and corn tortillas on at the same time! Way too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Just like the name says, it has an American twist on Mexican. I love it because it taste amazing and is good Mexican but not the kind I gotta run the bathroom immediately haha. Chips and salsa are a must add them to your order. El pastore burrito was ugh ok but carnaisada burrito was yum!"}
{"text":"SKIMPY DEAL on my burrito. 
Super Burrito (Scottsdale Rd.and Oak) laughs at your shenanigans!!
YOU HAVE INSULTED ME FOR THE LAST TIME.
I'm done with you. I'm never coming back.
I had to get a bag of popcorn at the gas station to fill the void."}
{"text":"I know it's only fastfood Mexican, but this was the most tasteless fastfood Mexican I have ever had.  I cannot tell you about the other locations, but this one, my first, did not leave me with a desire to go back.  And how does a bean and cheese burrito that the menu lists as being made with black beans, end up being made with watery refried beans? No, thank you."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about America's Taco Shop so I dropped in while my vehicle was being serviced nearby.  Reading over other reviews it appears this location does not live up to the standards that people expect from America's Taco Shop.  I cannot attest as I've never been to other locations.

Oddly enough my complaint is not the good but the price.  I ordered the 3 taco combo and a drink.  With a drink it came in at just under $12.  When my order arrived I was shocked, for the price, to see that it was literally just 3 tacos.  No sides.  

I did enjoy the tacos but it was of no real value.  I can go to a hole-in-the-wall further south down 16th St and get great food, and more of it, for half the price."}
{"text":"I have to agree with previous reviewers. While the food itself was alright the tacos I ordered fell apart too easily. The quality of the meat and condiments were ok but certain members of the staff could have been more friendly regarding the location of utensils. Also my table was uncleared as evident by left over food and sauce stains! Overall the food was cheap for the airport but I was disappointed with the eating experience and quality of service."}
{"text":"wow this place is terrible in every way.  I feel bad for the people who work here.  I ordered a corn on the cob and some tacos.  The corn was undercooked, I asked for another one and they were amazed that I refused to eat it uncooked.  The tacos were cold, I complained about that too and they didn't understand what to do.  I should not have to tell you how to make your food right.  The ceiling was leaking all over from the rain.  I could not find a table that was not being leaked on.  The place smells disgusting.  It is a dingy gross old building.  I will never go to an America's again, disgusting!!"}
{"text":"Food is above average.  The staff seems a bit too casual for my taste.  I know it's a take-out/quick service \"restaurant\", but talking to the guy in line in front of you about getting wasted isn't really my thing."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 Carne Asada Taco's for about $8. Order came out quickly and as I was handed the bag I looked inside and said, oh, I ordered 3 not one. Or are all three wrapped up in that tiny piece of tinfoil? You got it! 3 micro tacos that were at best an after thought. I walked out and about half way to the car, looking inside the bag opening the tin foil at the saddest sight I ever saw - 3 wanna be tacos that were aborted at birth... I said to myself....No I am not the one getting taco f**k*d here. Went back inside and said sorry this is not going to work for me. Instead I went over to 2 Hippies Taco's on 5th and Cambelback where they sell \"REAL\" taco's. 3 for $6 including tax! All 3 of America's Taco's could readily fit inside ONE of the 2 Hippies Taco's and have room left over!!! No joke! No attempt was made at customer satisfaction so I shall not return to America's Sad Taco Shop."}
{"text":"Great mexican food at great prices.  Happy Hour specials all weekend long - try the chicken (or beef or pork) quesadilla for $3, it is flavorful and delicious!  Margaritas only $3; husband and I enjoyed one out on the patio watching the beautiful AZ sunset on a Sunday evening.  Salsa has quite a bite, not that mild stuff like some other dumbed down mexican restaurants nearby.  Staff is super friendly and helpful explaining the menu.   Possibly the 5 star rating is a tad high, but I thought I had to even out the score after that last dweeb who posted an undeserved 2 stars."}
{"text":"I don't know Phoenix well enough to know the great debates over what taco joint is the best in town. I quizzed every local store clerk I could until I got a very passionate recommendation from the girl working at Smeeks, so my pal and I drove over and checked it out.

I have to also say that being from Michigan, my review is totally slanted by the fact that I drank a Coke with real sugar in it and chowed down on an awesome carne asada quesadilla on a sunny outdoor patio in mid-January. And really, I could care less if that influenced my review, because I was in love with the moment, and that's all that mattered.

Big time bonus points for the guy at the counter, who took my order, talked to me about the Creature From the Black Lagoon, and was in general very nice. I got out under $10 and still enjoyed a great meal that I'll remember for a while.

I know if I come back to Phoenix that I'll have to check out the competition, but for my money I thought America's Taco Shop was well worth the recommendation."}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price, went down town it was a little to crowded. This place was chill for the wife and kids"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and it never disappoints. It is priced very reasonably and the food is super tasty. Their tortillas are homemade and always awesome."}
{"text":"If there was an option for no stars this would get one. Carne asade was dry and over cooked rendering it flavorless, chicken quesadilla was flavorless. Rice and beans always ok. We love Mexican food and this is not how Mexican food tastes like, even if it's American. I felt like telling the people in line, as we were leaving, to turn around and go get your money's worth else where, even Taco Bell is better. Sad to say, and hate to say it."}
{"text":"I've been thinking to try this place for ever. I finally did and I'm sad to report that per my taco standards it's barely OK.

I got 2 al pastor and 2 carne asada tacos. I also ordered the \"cuatro\" (chips, salsa, guacamole and beans). 

Besides the $21 that this cost me, the food was absolutely uneventful. The tortillas were cold, the beans were lacking flavor, the salsa was meh and the guacamole was average.

The al pastor tacos were kind of sweet and if you've read my comments before, you know that I can't stand the heartbreaking moment when you expect something (because they name their dish the same of something you're craving) and you get something totally different or at least far enough from the real thing.

The carne asada tacos were OK but they had this indescribable green topping that was totally unexpected (in a bad way). I don't know what it was but i believe there was some onion and celery involved. Not authentic at all, at least nothing I've ever seen in Mexico.

Veredict:

If you pass by, it's OK for a quick bite with low expectations, otherwise, I wouldn't crave it.

Cheers."}
{"text":"There's a lot to like about America's Taco Shop:

1) It's in a converted house. With chalkboard lining on the upper walls. Tables not crammed together. An interplay between Mana and Juanes on the stereo.

2) America is friendly. I'm not talking about the country, which can be friendly depending on the situation and who you are. I'm talking about the taco lady, who is warm, welcoming, and helpful no matter who walks in the door. She'll ask if it's your first time and then come up with a load of suggestions.

3) The carne asada is wow. I'm serious.

And one thing not so much to like about America's taco shop:

1) The price. 3 tiny tacos, chips and an agua fresca = something like $12. I wasn't anticipating on spending that much at a taco shop. The food was damn good, don't get me wrong, but this place may be more of an indulgence than a regular pitstop.

Last thing to know, this joint is all about the carne asada, so it's best you are a fan of beef. There isn't much middle ground between it and vegetarian options (ie. no chicken on the menu, from what I can remember). Not that this a bad thing. Just worth keeping in mind for friends who have red meat restrictions.

4 solid stars."}
{"text":"Was walking around Old Town and came across the taco shop. What a gem of a find it was. The tacos are everything you think of when eating a street taco even though it's in a restaurant setting. The patio is wonderful to boot."}
{"text":"First time here. I had 3 carne Asada tacos and a side of beans. This place is super pricey!!!! Tacos are $2.50 each and are small. The food was okay, the beans and salsa were the best. Carne asada tacos didn't have too much flavor. The horchata was amazing! Probably the best thing here. Won't be back. It's not worth the money."}
{"text":"My boyfriend found this place and wanted me to try their bean and cheese burritos. We are vegetarian and they don't use lard in the beans. I was excited to try it but my excitement quickly faded. We arrived around 6 pm on a weekday and there was a bit of a line at the counter with people ordering so naturally I'm looking around, up and down for a menu board or SOMETHING that I can look at to decide what I want. Nope! The only menu is a taped to the back of the register and I couldn't see it through the crowd, so I stood in line having no clue what I was going to order. It really really slowed down the whole process! So I quickly order a bean and cheese with jalapeños so I don't hold up the line, even though I'm not sure if had had time to look if that's what I would have gotten. We get some chips and guacamole and head out to the patio to grab a seat. Well the patio is dark and every table was dirty so we pushed the plates aside and sat at a dirty table. Finally someone comes out and I mention it's dark. The employee plugs in the lights. Yay! 

Now the food. Guacamole was not good, way too much lime! 
My bean and cheese burrito was luke warm and all the jalapeños were at the bottom. There was barely any cheese or flavor to the beans. Also beans must be kept hot to avoid food borne illness. It was pretty gross. The green salsa which we had to ask for tasted really weird. My boyfriend wouldn't eat his at all and we both love green salsa, it was funky! 
No one ever cleared the previous diners dirty plates off the table so we took them in at the end ourselves. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is so adorable. I went here with a friend, and the prices are really good! The inside is on the small side, but their outdoor patio is HUGE. We ate outside on a lovely evening, and I felt like I was at a Mexican-backyard-party! It was a lot of fun, and it is beautiful on their patio! I can't wait to go back on another beautiful day!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent the downtown 7th avenue location but then I moved across town. Much to my surprise they opened one down the street from me on Via de Ventura. I love the Pastor burrito. The meat is slow cooked and marinated, they add pineapple to the burrito and a guacamole concoction that's really tasty.  The Carne is good here too. Not quite the same downtown vibe as the 7th ave location (more modern and sterile) but same friendly service and great food. The chips and salsa are good as well. The other night, they ran out of pastor meat due to a late night rush, the employee was gracious and gave me some free taco coupons for my next visit. Lunch time can be pretty busy here (noon to 1pm) other than that - service is fast.  My only complaint is the soda machine is one of those new computerized versions with hundreds of flavors - the soda's never taste good from these machines.  I'd suggest the owners ditch the new wave machine and go old school with a regular soda fountain."}
{"text":"How does a taco shop get 4 stars off of 150 reviews in one location and absolutely suck in another???

I was happy to see this taco shop open up close(r) to my office. I had heard the good reviews of the other location and had been looking forward to giving it a try, so when this one opened it was a no-brainer.

I love me some tacos... BOY do I love me some tacos.

BOY does this place make a weak one. I got the sampler with one of each. 1 chicken, 1 carne asada, 1 pastor. I ate them in that order and each was less appetizing than the next.

When I got back to the office I called the 7th street location to see if they were affiliated. Apparently this a franchise with each location owned independently, so don't take this review as a review of the one on 7th.

It is good to note though, that this IS a franchise. Usually not a good sign. I'm not sure what the other location looks like, but this location was a bright and steril looking place like Baja Fresh (who makes much better tacos by the way, but everywhere makes better tacos than this place.). Decades of ruthless taco devouring experience has made me instinctually prefer a seedy looking establishment where English is definitely a second language as a sign that a good taco is about to be served. Some chipper gringo high school girl was at the counter of this establishment.

I've had MUCH better tacos at taco bell and Carl's Jr. Sad sad sad.

Meat was dry, seasonings flopped, dry thick corn tortillas. I still ate them... they were still tacos after all. They were the worst I've had in quite a long time. This is extra nuts because I got there at 11:45 to beat the lunch rush. Usually this means everything is extra hot and fresh. um...nope.

No wonder the place was empty... even when I left at 12:30. Wonder what the next restaurant at this location will be?"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today. I really liked it and will go back again. I thought the tacos were great as well as the salsa. The chips were very good, but not the best I've ever had. I would definitely recommend this place!"}

The meat was so tasty, and the sandwich was pretty filling (although it was so good I could have eaten another and just suffered through being really full).  My friends and I also had the guacamole, which may now be my favorite guacamole.  It had a great kick to it with a lot of cilantro...yum!

We got there around 1:00 in the afternoon, and it wasn't crowded, but I'm guessing we were there after the lunch rush.  Parking did seem to be a pain as the spots in back were pretty limited."}
{"text":"I have been to America's Taco Shop by ASU, and I liked it. However I think this location is better.I prefer this location because of its modern decor and setup. More importantly, it feels cleaner.

I ordered the carne asada, chicken, and al pastor tacos. Chicken was my least favorite one, but probably the most healthy. The carne asada taco and al pastor tacos were on point. I also got free chips and salsa from yelp check-in deal, I appreciate it, but I would not pay money for it next time.

complaint: my vegetarian friend did not get his order until most of us were done with our foods. Fortunately we were not in a rush, but it's annoying. My review would have been 4-stars if not for this issue.

Overall, a good place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Value = horrible.  The price for the tiny tacos is really a joke.  Sorry to have to say this, but unless they cut their prices in half, I won't be back."}
{"text":"First Impression:
Ordering a burrito involves deciding between two different sizes of burros? Reg and XL. I went with the regular on account of my personal mission to fight the obesity epidemic, one bite, one burrito at a time. Turns out I was siding with the models on this one, and not those Dove approves. The burrito regular is on the small side, and costs $5.99. I suppose it is intended to lighten my figure and my wallet, simultaneously. Regarding carne asada -- it is indeed legit, there is a lot of flavor packed into the tiny tortilla. Lots of flavor, just the right amount of juice, some fresh onions lightly grilled (also inside), and a side of salsa. The hot salsa, is not spicy, but it has good flavor.

On my second visit I came by on a Sunday morning to try the breakfast burrito. There was a daily special and the XL size cost only $4.50. Filled with chorizo, eggs, beans and cheese and accompanied with a side of salsa, it turned out to be 3/5 stars. The chorizo was mild, not the kind that would show up at your Grandma's house for breakfast if you were from Douglas, AZ. I found out that the XL size is really a normal people size burrito. I wonder if this taco shop is catering to ASU sorority girls. 

They get get 4 stars for dynamite flavor on the carne."}
{"text":"10 bucks really for a x small burrito the meat was burnt if i didn't have a 30 min lunch i would of went back ill not be returning"}
{"text":"After reading everyone's reviews I went in with high expectations - perhaps too high. We ordered two carne asada burritos, chips and salsa, the corn everyone raved about on Yelp along with two carne asada tacos. The burritos were a decent size. I was disappointed that there wasn't more than a small dollop of guacamole at one of the burrito. The meat was lean and flavorful however tasted very charred. Some of the inner pieces tasted good though the meat was seasoned with too much salt. The meat was lean and tender. 

Chips and salsa were okay. I love it when a restaurant heats up the chips - this place does not. The salsa was fresh tasting and not overly spicy. Neither my husband nor I liked the corn. It is corn on the cob dipped in a mayonnaise sauce with Mexican cheese sprinkled on top. It is garnished with a hot sauce and limes. 

Whoever mentioned the small side portions of the lime, radish and cucumber were dead on. The lime was so tiny I didn't get more than a drop of juice from it. 

The servers were friendly and it is an easy place to take your children as long as your total party does not exceed four. The place is tiny but decorated nicely."}
{"text":"This is my second visit this week. Good, casual place to eat. We love the Carne Asada and the chicken.  Good in Quesadilla or Torta. Breakfast burrito was delicious as well.  Fair priced as well. The Horchata was a Little thick like to much powder or cinnamon.  Something was off.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I should have trusted my instincts. I wanted to give an extra star for the very nice lady who took my order, but I can't because the food is THAT bad! This veggie quesadilla sounded weird with its grilled onions and lettuce. It was worse than I expected. Completely inedible. Went straight to the trash. $6 down the drain."}
{"text":"Fast and delicious. Nice employees and a fresh taste. Food doesn't make you feel overly full and the vampiros are delicious"}
{"text":"Extremely displeased with the quality of service. The young man and lady at the counter were kind and professional. However, I placed an order for a single item with fixing on the side. There were two other people who placed an order shortly after I did (and a larger one) got their food before we did.

I specifically bought our food to feed my kids and it wasn't prepared correctly. I guess I should've emphasized that the order was for younger hungry kids. 

I don't want to pull the race card, but I am. Sad that our diverse neighborhood taco shop is not a fair business. 
I won't be back again. Good people working there, but didn't feel like I was as welcomed as the lighter skinned customers. Sad to write this review. (Twice I Gave the benefit of doubt twice and both times they backfired). 

[i live by the golden rule, so I don't ever expect bad service...guessing, sometimes it's just low morale.]

We just wound up making our kids food on the stove. 

(Ended up Eating the quesadilla with a tortilla that had a lot of vacancy on it. Tasted great, but again. Not worth going back for another potential let down).


May the owner/management encourage all staff to be more mindful, with human compassion for \"all customers\" regardless of content of clothing, gender or color of skin.

Some people have bad days, I get it. Just hope this is not the norm. I hope the best for all local neighborhood businesses, but this location didn't feel welcoming at all. As a life long resident to the Coronado, this sucks to feel like the way I do."}
{"text":"I just want to add, that since becoming vegan, this is my go to spot for a damn good burrito!  The tortillas are vegan as are the beans, thanks for not using lard peeps!!  Get a bean burrito Terry's way! You'll thank me for this later!  Plus, the regular, tamarindo or jamaica margarita's are all to die for!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for some good tasty Mexican food. The staff is always happy to talk about the various items on the menu and makes great suggestions. We had the Ceviche, Vampiro, and Two Tacos and tried both Margaritas. I would no suggest the Jamaican Margarita but some people like it."}
{"text":"This was the worst taco experience ever! My suggestion is keep walking by! . No cold beer to wash down the Yuk!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of America's ever since I was introduced to it over a year ago.  I tend to eat vegetarian dishes most of the time, and can definitely say I've had my fair share of non-meat dishes with no flavor.  
The beans here are amazing (and lard free!), as is the guacamole.  The Trio is a great starter which includes chips, salsa, and guacamole. For the vegetarians the bean burrito (I add guac to it with a roasted jalapeno on the side), is quite tasty.  The menu item I look forward to the most (and sometimes go just for this item) is the America's corn.  Don't let the ingredients scare you away, just try it.  It's DELICIOUS!.  Sweet corn covered in mayo, cotija cheese, chili, and lime.  My boyfriend frowned at it the first few times I ate it in front of him, but once he gave it a chance he was hooked.  I crave these all the time!
I do have one complaint about America's, and that is the horchata.  The horchata had good flavor, but is REALLY grainy.  I think it would be a lot better if it was strained.  This has lead me to no longer order horchata from here which is unfortunate because it makes a great accompaniment to their main dishes.        
I have been to all three of their locations and each has an awesome patio great for enjoying a beer or margarita on a warm Phoenix day!"}
{"text":"I've definitely had better tacos and pricing elsewhere, is was just ok. I'll try the one in tempe next time, maybe it will be better. Horchata wasn't that great either:( salsa and meat had no taste! The meat was dry and sad looking... boo maybe 2 stars?"}
{"text":"I looooooove ATS! The bean burritos are the best around, hands down! And the happy hour beer special is pretty nice too :-)."}
{"text":"I'm an avid regular at the Tempe location and I'm pleased to report that the food here is just as good, but the location is decked out with that over-the-top Scottsdale flair."}
{"text":"Since my last check in here, I have been here almost every other weekend for lunch dates with friends and family. Although the quality of the food is great, I really wish that they would let people know ahead of time that the Al Pastor won't be ready until a certain time. Especially since their Wednesday special consists of an Al Pastor burrito. You can't just expect people to come in and not ask for it if it is advertised, or at least clearly stated that it won't be ready until an hour or so after opening. Isn't this something you could be preparing before you open in the morning? It is a delicious item, and my favorite at that, just wish preparation and timing was a tad bit different."}
{"text":"Two visits during my brief trip to Phoenix.  Had carne asada both times.  The burrito was very plump and fresh.  I enjoy the very thin style tortillas used here.  Prices were dirt cheap."}
{"text":"Giving them one more star because I tasted the 7th Street location and actually liked the food at this location better (less bland). Additionally, they have a patio in the front I didn't see the first time, which is nice when traffic isn't too bad. Service the last time I was here was also very friendly."}
{"text":"i got food poisoning here the 2nd time i ate here. it was horrible. =("}
{"text":"At first glance this cute place has promise. You quickly realize upon entering that it's cute, clean & the menu looks yummy but the service on both occassions pathetic. We came in on a lazy Sunday late lunch & just attributed the lack luster service was due to maybe a late Sat night out & hey we've all been there. We gave it a second shot on a Friday date night because the previous trip we enjoyed the salsas & the cold beers. However Friday night same register/server was there & again she was not happy to be there & not informative. Mean while the younger version of her is at the register next to us serving chips & beer happily. Even asking her patrons if they'd like some limes with thier cerveza. This was disappointing. The food was ok. I had the special which was the civeche tostada & it was very small. I wish I had been told & I would've ordered 2. The flavor was on par for sure & again the salsas & beer was cold. The hubs had the carne asada burrito but opted not to get the larger & it was a perfect burrito size for a light burrito eater like me but he was disappointed with the size of his burrito. The flavor though was good & moist which with carne asada burrito is really somethng because more often then not you get dry meat. So that was a plus. With more then one location in the downtown corridor we'll be trying the 7th st shop but 7th ave we won't be back due to service entirely. So I'm grateful they have more locations to try since the food is good & decently priced."}
{"text":"Today we had an office fiesta, thanks in part to America's Taco Shop. 

Some lessons learned, but overall the consensus was YUM. 

In the future we will order online and travel with a pick-up buddy (which is what we have to do for Pei Wei as well, but that's another review). Poor Jami went to pick up our orders by herself and had to park far away and walk in the 100-and-who-knows-what degree heat. 

I had the carne asada tacos, and I opted for the roasted jalapenos on top. These tacos were so delicious ..... You cannot go wrong with their carne asada. 

Everyone else also ooohed and ahhhed over their entrees. The chips and guacamole were also delicious. 

I cannot wait to get take out from here again."}
{"text":"LOVE the carne asada tacos, which come in corn tortillas and are served with guacamole, caramelized onions and lettuce. I usually order three, and after my second I start to think maybe my eyes were bigger than my stomach, but then I polish the third off anyway. 

The guacamole is awesome -- I split an order of chips and guac, and between our meals and that as a side, it was too much. So, I took the guacamole back to the office, and it was still great the next day."}
{"text":"I went here when this place first opened and it was AMAZING. I went there this past Sunday at 1130 AM and was truly disappointed. We ordered 2 carne Asada burritos, and chips and beans. The beans were cold, barely luke warm, our burritos were both filled with so much pico de gallo, and so little carne asade, it made the entire burrito a cold soggy mess. There were no trash cans available, except the kind you find in an office cubicle, no tables outside (previously were), nothing on the condiment bar was stocked or even looked like it had been clean and wiped down for days. I watched someone get up and leave after eating, & about 10 minutes later another couple came in and sat down at the exact same table. No one that worked there had a care in the world about wiping the table down, or actually working. It's sad to say, because I really like this place, but I am writing it off to another place that will be shut down in a year. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their salsa.  I'm addicted to it all! I honestly eat here 3 times a week and I'm okay with it! I love this place! Its a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"I am so happy that America's has found such great success!  Simple Mission accomplished: Amazing food.   Love me some Bean & Cheese burrito. (tip: ask for it Terry's style...they add raw white onion and hot sauce).  Their vampiros are delicious of course....but the show stopper is the Carne Asada Torta.  As a native arizonan...I am assuring you, this is the best.  

They offer a free Chips & Trio if you sign up for their loyalty club...and don't forget to follow them on Facebook!  it's always nice to have a reminder when their happy hours are, half of taco days and $2 coronas ! :)"}
{"text":"Great food. Happy staff. Love the location and the quaint homey design of the restaurant. Back patio seating is primo !"}
{"text":"This is the first and last visit to this location.  I've been to the other locations and have always had a great experience.  We showed up at 12:45 and the signature El-Pastor was still raw - the ETA was around 2pm which is a joke considering when people eat lunch.  Service was VERY slow, we had to send back a quesadilla because it barely had any cheese and the tortilla was barely heated up.  The place was not clean or organized with a lot of dirty tables and stuff on floors.

This is not a good representation of this specific chain/franchise.  Always have a great experience at other locations."}
{"text":"Mi casa es su casa!  Literally!  This little house in phenix was converted into a taco shop. Talk about home cooking!
I really enjoyed my visit. food was good, and so was the service. I had tacos de carne asada and a Mexican coke. Yes there's a difference. (Coke review coming soon) plenty of parking in the back (yard). Make sure to stop by and pay them a visit. I like it so much I think I'm moving in.
Keys please!"}
{"text":"Spontaneous dinner idea with my mom. Be sure to check in for those FREE chips and salsaaaa"}
{"text":"First time at this place and it was meh. Kind of overpriced for tacos. The chips were stale. The quesadilla was oily. Hit up Rubios or something else.
Update- downgraded to 1 star as you will spend the evening in the bathroom."}
{"text":"First I should say I don't like Mexican food.  I struggle to find something I can eat on the menu.   Went here tonight since someone else was craving it...I had an incredible egg, chorizo, potato, cheese breakfast burritto for dinner.  I made it clear that it had to be as spice free as possible and they did a wonderful job.  I saw the ppm taxis and bean burritto get devoured.  Guacomole had a bit too much of a kick for me bit that is how most people like it.  We took our order to go and it was all good when we got home."}
{"text":"for burritos, this place is great.

america's bean and cheese burrito features peruano beans, which are definitely tastier than your standard pinto.  pretty simple and straightforward, but well executed.  has the unfortunate tendency to fall apart, though, as the delicious beans soak through the delicious tortilla wrapper.

the carne asada here is super tasty.  obviously, anyone claiming the best carne asada in phoenix can expect a throwdown, but for people with gringo sensibilities, this is a pretty great version - not as crispy as some more traditional places, well-seasoned, and juicy, which is rare among carne asada purveyors.

i think the best way to experience it is in a burrito, but i know people who are big fans of the torta and the taco incarnations as well.

beer is cheap.  refresco margaritas are divine, getting better with each sip.  the patio is a really fun place to hang out.

there are a few knocks keeping this from five-star perfection.  quesadillas are a bit disappointing and boring given the quality of everything else.  there is a lack of salsa offered for your food. you get a cup of some fresh and tasty - but crushingly mild - stuff, with no options for spicier or more interesting fare.

all in all, a really solid neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars I would! We used America's to cater our daughter's graduation party and were beyond impressed with all aspects of the transaction. From start to finish it was an A+ experience. Bri ,the catering manager, was so easy to work with and Zack, the owner, did the actual delivery and set up (only charged $15 for delivery and set up!!) 
Our many guests raved about the food - it was pretty clear that they liked it as they were returning to the tables over and over again. We served mini burritos and had a taco bar set up for 80  people. The food was abundant- so many salsas and delicious guacamole and beans. We will look for a reason to use them again."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review from their premises. On our arrival the restaurant was empty. We ordered drinks and food at the same time. Unfortunately they arrived as we ordered them - at the same time, actually food arrived before drinks. Our cashier was our server - understaffed..??

Food is decent, but service at this location is really really poor!! Not geared towards keeping customers - no wonder this place is always empty at dinner time. We feel rushed to leave with impersonable and inattentive service. They always miss to deliver our roasted jalapeños although we get charged for them. My margarita came after our food - please, is this a friendly neighborhood Mexican restaurant or a Mcdonald's  type of corporate BS..? 

It's the height of the Soccer World Cup and the tv inside is blaring a baseball game..?? That shows to me the complete detachment of owners to their franchisees. It's an American money making machine, not the family owned Mexican restaurant it was portrayed to be in their advertisements.

This place will be going down!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today as the line for Chipotle (which is across the street) was out the door and I didn't have time to wait.  It was roughly 12:45 and there were maybe 2 other tables of people at ATS. Ordered a regular carne asada burrito with \"hot\" salsa. Here is where the experience turned south.  The burrito came out within 5 minutes and it was much smaller than I was expecting given that with tax it was close to $7. The \"hot\" salsa was mild at best and the burrito was not even remotely warm. It was also probably the worst tasting carne asada burrito I've ever had (and i love me a carne asada burrito!). I love the other ATS locations but there is something off about this location.    I would have been better off at Taco Bell or waiting in line at chipotle.  Hell, if i want cold lunch i would have been better off at Subway. Do yourself a favor and do not waste your money or calories eating here. :(."}
{"text":"I have been to two Americas taco shops and both were good but this location was a little better. They also have the yelp check I. For free chips which is awesome. I love the chips they remind me if the chips from Taco del Mar. The bean burrito is good. The tacos seem to vary depending on how long the meat is cooked. Defiantly a place to check out if you like Mexican food in the style of chipotle or taco del mar."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out. We came on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers. The place was clean and the staff was friendly.  My husband ordered the taco trio and I ordered the Carne Asada burrito.  Both dishes were delicious. My only complaint is that I would have preferred more salsa with my burrito. I easily could have asked, but didn't. 


Update: I got very sick about 40 minutes after eating here. WE WILL NOT RETURN!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Don't get thrown off by the name- this isn't Americanized gorditos and chalupas. Tasty, flavorful Al Pastor and Carne Asada burritos. Try the corn! It's unique and delicious. On the weekends they have happy hour deals all day, which are a bargain ($1: 7oz beer? $2: 12 oz beer? $3 margarita? YES!) They forgot a few things from our order and we had to remind them to bring them, but other than that overall very pleased with America's. Plus, we paid way less for a full meal than if we had gotten baseball park food."}
{"text":"Filthy. No one to buss tables. The place needs a cleaning. Trash in fire pit. Dead plants around fountain. Empty food containers on sidewalk.  Used paper napkins blowing around patio. Tacos ok, just get them delivered."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. It's cheap, it's delicious and it doesn't make you feel miserable later on like other fast food-y type places. The bean and cheese burrito is my fave, no lard!

The ladies who work at this joint, (mostly women), are the nicest. They always act happy to see me and now know me by name; I may have a burrito problem.

Plus, the company is involved in the community. Just last week they did a #CarneforaCause day, giving 20% of their daily profits valley-wide to Phoenix Children's Hospital. Yummy and altruistic, love that."}
{"text":"Oh, America, what have you done?  I've been eating at this restaurant since you opened at this location.  Back then your food was delicious.  The carne was muy bueno, and the elote was fantastico.  I hadn't visited in a while, but upon my return found the food bearing only a vauge resemblance to it's past wonderfullness.  Maybe now that you have several locations your available attention is diminished.  I won't be back America, there are too many good Mexican places close by to eat at your place anymore.  Adios."}
{"text":"They claim to have the best carne asada in town. I believe them. All I had was a carne asada burrito, so this 5-star review is based on a single item."}
{"text":"This place is darling and so darn yummy. That is HUGE coming from me because I am normally not a mexican food fan. 

The staff is super friendly and very welcoming. They have plenty of options on the menu sure to please meat lovers, vegetarians, and I'm sure even vegans. Their beans don't have lard in them and all the ingredients are fresh. I enjoyed myself some chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. The salsa that comes with the chips is UNREAL. That sealed the deal for me. Killer salsa= one way to my heart.

My burrito was the perfect size, the tortilla had the best flavor and texture, and it wasn't overly packed with cheese. One reason I can't stand eating burritos is the normally ridiculous amount of cheese included that makes me feel like 1-oil is seeping out of my every pore and 2- my arteries clogging from the greasiness. This burrito killed it! I'm kind of still thinking about it.

I can't wait to go back to try a veggie burrito and possibly a skinny margarita."}
{"text":"No A/C so get your order to go. Don't come hungry portion sizes are small and it's pricey. I absolutely love their burritos but wouldn't recommend as a must-go-to-place."}
{"text":"Customer service: Excellent!
Atmosphere: Nice
Music: AWESOME!
Food: Yikes! The menu says the carne asada burrito has grilled onions.  Yeah, what my burrito had was thick, quarter chunks of raw onion in it.  I was so disappointed. It made the entire burrito unappetizing and overpowered.  I did the most awful thing, I unwrapped my burrito and picked out all the onions.  I rewrapped it and the disappointment was still there.  I should have asked for my money back...but that's not my style.  

Cafe Rio is just a hop, skip, and a jump from here.  They are far superior.  Sorry señora America Corrales, but your chefs need to know what grilled onions are.  Grilled onions are gorgeous and browned, they are soft and sweet."}
{"text":"I went here once...totally didn't know what to expect.  For such a small place I expected the worst.  All I can say is it was surprisingly good.  The corn on the cob covered in cheese looked like a nightmare but it was the best thing I've had in a long time.  Carne asada was also really, really good.  Salsas and guacamole were nice and fresh.  Overall a great find.  Will for sure be back again and again...am anticipating the opening of the new location so I don't have to drive so far."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  We need one in the West valley!! 
Service is awesome and the food is fresh and delicious.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Used to love this place!  El Pastor salad was amazing!!!  Changed their menu and no longer serve beer!"}
{"text":"The food is good, I'll give it that, but the service lacks. I go out so that I DON\"T have to cook, clean, etc., etc. and am more than willing to pay for that service, but I hate when I go somewhere and they act like they are doing you a favor. I know how to make carne asada and the likes. I'll stay home for the most part!"}
{"text":"Had Carne asada tacos. Meat was tasty...but too  grisly..not worth  almost $3 per taco. . BEWARE PRICES!!! Prices on wall not same as menu. And extra for a sprinkle of jalapeños,? That's should almost be illegal!  Beans were better than most establishments. Lard free being their catch phrase. Note: that does not say fat free. Parking is a pain. Prob won't go back. Over $12 for a bean & cheese burrito &two tiny tacos & can of pop. & my receipt did not break down how much each item cost....Buyer Beware!"}
{"text":"I hope America isn't aware of the terrible things Kahala Franchising is doing to her reputation. I just ate at the Via De Ventura location,. and for an  $8+ burrito that was supposed to be al pastor I got grizzle and a lot of tortilla. I haven't felt ill like that since the last time I had McDonald's 20 years ago. I know at this rate they will go out of  business...I just hope they go under fast enough to avoid ruining what has been my top recommendation for Mexican fast food in the Phoenix metro. They're nasty...super nasty."}
{"text":"This place is almost stereotypical for the Americanized Mexican fast food, but as it isn't a chain and since the food was quite tasty I feel that I am wrong if I don't promote it. 

I had the pastor burrito, that come with a decent amount of nice tasting pork - and they have coupled this with some kind of pineapple sauce that is way tastier than it looks. As I will not drive here to catch my lunch, I will stop by here if I am in the neighborhood.

Food is good, everything else is kind of a minimum effort - but I appreciate a local business over a franchise any day. So, for what it is.. it's good!"}
{"text":"Food SUCKS! And was expensive for the offering -- it just sucks... First time here so I ordered the #1 3 taco combo ... Food was cold, uninspired and flavorless! Mexican tacos are about flavor and fresh zesty textures -- the tacos have none of that!
 Void of any spice or flavor --
Will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended. It thought it was so so. 

Went here for our last stop during our Arizona weekend. I had a vegetarian burrito, which was actually quite good. My husband had the carne asada burrito, which he really liked. Then I had the corn, which didn't have much flavor at all, even though it was covered in mayo and cheese. 

It does have a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Prices were great."}
{"text":"Recently ate at the newer Elliott and Kyrene location (which was my first experience with America's Taco Shop). I am glad that I visited the other location first because had I visited this location first I am not sure I would have tried it again.  

I ordered chicken tacos at both locations and the food quality was the same, both were very good.  The down side to this location is its age. Not that it has to be completely new or updated necessarily,  but it feels very dirty.  Bugs in the light shades,  dirty window sills,  and the bathrooms smell horrible.  Unfortunately their seating is limited,  so we also had to sit next to the bathrooms... which was not a pleasant experience.  

Lastly,  I ordered guacamole at both locations.  It seemed much less flavorful here and had a consistency of yogurt (not your typical guacamole). 

I will just make the Elliott road location the one I visit in the future.  

Overall,  love the food though!"}
{"text":"If you want to spend a lot of money for not a lot of food then is the place to go! $8-$9 for a regular carne quesadilla that looks like it's from the kids menu. Chicken burrito was an okay size but didnt have much chicken and the chicken it did have was mostly ligaments. Almost no seating and feels like it's 90 degrees inside. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"America's has always had a consistent and delicious bean&cheese burrito.  Its not the size of something you would find at Bertos, but its waaay better quality. They only have one other vegetarian entree - a veggie quesadilla.  I do wish they had more veg options and all of their specials seemed to be geared towards their meat eaters.

I think their refried beans and tortillas are heavenly!  The flan is homemade any yummy, too!

It drives me bonkers that they are so dang stingy with their salsa! They make me feel like they are doing me a super-exclusive favor if I ask for extra."}
{"text":"Overall , I like this place. A smal hole-in-the-wall place with straight forward, cheap, non-greasy Mexican food. I can dig it. I personally think the one on 7th st is better, but I will chock it up to growing pains since this location's only been open for about a week. I went today for my all time favorite Torta, but they didn't grill my bread so it wasn't nearly as awesome as it usually is...yes, I'm picky"}
{"text":"Pros: 
1. Amazing delicious real mexican food. 
2. Best breakfast burrito I've ever had. 
3. The Guac is so FRESH and delicious. 
4. Great beer specials. 
Cons: 
1. Food is over priced for sure. $8.00 for a freaking XL carne asada. 
2. Kind of cramped inside. 
3. They need a spicier salsa. 

Overall, great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Wow.

Been there 2 times.  I wanted to revisit to see if it was a fluke, and to my pleasant surprise - it wasn't.  I'm from NW Indiana originally.  I know corn.  Indiana sweet corn cannot be beat - well - until I had the corn from America's Taco Shop.  This corn has cotija cheese, hot sauce, mayo, and I swear crack.  There has to be crack in there... I have viscous dreams about that corn and wake up in a cold sweat.  I need that corn... it's just so good.  

I don't eat beef and that's the only meat they serve but that won't stop me.  Their vampiro's minus the carne asada, bean and cheese burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla are all awesome.  They also have delicious horchata.... but that corn.... 

I know where I'm going tonight."}
{"text":"Were the worst tacos I have ever had in my life. I had a carne asada taco, chicken taco, and beans. The chicken taco was flavorless, the carne asada taco meat tasted burnt and the beans tasted HORRIBLE. The prices are too high for the portion sizes and the food tasted awful. Went there once and will never go back again. Really disappointed; dont waste your money!"}
{"text":"My love for America's remains, but went down a star for the inconsistency of the hours.  On more than one occasion in the past month we have arrived to find the restaurant closed in contradiction to business hours.  There has just been a printout on the door saying \"we're closed please head to the Melrose location, mention this and get 20% off your order.\"  By the time I've been disappointed in my decision to choose a closed restaurant for my meal, I am certainly not interested in traveling to another location.  I want something close and convenient (like this location).  So now we're still fans, just only during weekdays, which seem to be the only days they're open."}
{"text":"When I saw the name \"Americas taco shop\" the first thing that came to mind was \"Taco Bell\", good ole \"American\" Tacos... I was relieved when I found out the name is not based on the country but rather the name of a Hispanic Woman. Based on the \"Arnold Palmer\" beverage I have learned that if something that you consume is being named after a person then it is probably worth consuming.... just ask Reuben!!!

I frequent this location and when ever I am in the mood for a Mexican coke I will drop in like a paratrooper with one objective in mind. seek and destroy that sugary beverage. but like any mission other obstacles present them self that I did not initially anticipate. In the case of Operation Americas Taco Shop it always turns out to be the chips and salsa. It doesn't end there though.... they have backup, and it is in the form of carne asada. Carne asada is tricky because it sneaks up under the comfort of a fluffy torta bun, or under the cover of a well grilled tortilla. I tend to always end up with a regular bean and cheese burrito and a regular carne asada quesadilla. for me it is a manageable task and I do not need to radio in back up.

This is a mission that I will choose to accept on numerous occasions in the future. as long as the threat of carne asada is amongst us you can count on me to be there at \"Americas\" for Americans!!!"}
{"text":"OMG it's so good!. Ate there today for lunch for the second time since they've opened and the portions are definitely smaller then Chipotle's but the food is fabulous and so much better than Chipotles. It's a little pricey as you dont get that much food for what they are charging but the food is crazy good. When they first opened, I waited a while to get my food but today it was much quicker with what looked like the same amount of people in line, which I guess is normal since all the employees got more familiar with the menu. I always get the pastor torta which I think has the best value. If you are going to get taco's get two or three. One simply won't fill you up and combo things to get more for your buck!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and often have to order lunch for a small group of employees. I used to come here when it was a Baja Fresh and really appreciated their great service and liked their food. I decided to try ATS since I hadn't been yet since they opened.

I attempted to place an order online through their website. Selected the store location and went through the process of placing my order. Right before I was to pay, it showed a screen that says something to the effect that after I pay, the order will be sent to the location on Via de Ventura in Scottsdale.  So I cancelled the order and drove to the store instead.

When I arrived, there were about 5 people who were dining, one woman behind the counter, the manager and a district manager. The woman didn't greet me but said, \"Can I take your order?\" Before I placed my order, I shared with her that I had tried to place the order online and the manager overhead. He thanked me for letting him know and said that his DM was there and he would let him know. Apparently, it has been an issue because he said someone else also complained about this.

I went ahead and placed the order with the woman, who didn't seem all that thrilled that I was placing an order.  In the middle of me giving her the items, she stops and helps the DM find an order that was for another customer! Then she comes back to me and says \"ok, what else\". 

After I placed my food order, the manager tells the DM that another customer (me) had trouble with the online system and that I was here (pointing in my direction) if he wanted to talk to me. The DM looked past me at the other diners and proceeded to place a phone call to someone to tell them that the online system wasn't working. He hung up the phone and then about 5 min later goes to another table to ask them if they were the ones who tried to place the online order.  They said no and I spoke up and said that I was.  I told him what had happened and he called the person on the phone back and told them specifically that it gave the Via de Ventura address. He didn't thank me nor offer me a free drink or anything. I think his manager was more helpful in hearing the feedback than he was.

About the food, I can't speak for the others who ordered the following (carne asada burrito, chicken tacos, chicken quesadilla, carne asada vampire) but I ordered a single chicken taco. When I returned to the office which is less than a mile away, and opened the taco, the entire thing was cold. I didn't know if this was normal but gauging from the other yelp reviews, I take it, that it's not supposed to be cold! The guac was tasty = one star. I give it one star for having a coke freestyle machine but there are other restaurants in the area that have it and have MUCH better service!

Based on the poor customer service as a first time visitor, I might try this place one more time but am not in any rush to do so. Definatley disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the second one I've been to, and it is equally as satisfying. Amazing carne asada! Great prices... the salsas they have are ridiculously good. I hit up this place every chance I get!"}
{"text":"So I decided to return and give it a second chance. My food didn't blow me out of the water the first time I went, but was pretty good and I've been having some serious cravings for carne asada lately.  I went with the Torta de Carna Asada and HOLEY MEXICAN SANDWICH BATMAN!!! The absolute best torta I've ever had!! The bread was super soft and flaky, had the carne asada (which was much better this time..and two days later when I went again...sssh don't tell my wife) guacamole and I think onions.  Overall, THAT'S the item I'll go back for....probably more than my wife and doctor would sanction....but I won't tell if you don't tell....."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever!! I love how everything is super fresh too!! Everything made fresh daily is really nice especially if you want food that is worth the price you pay!! Only thing tho is that some of the employees are mouthy and have attitudes as well but other than that I would go back anytime!!!"}
{"text":"This location at the airport is a gross injustice to ANY traveler!  Ordered a simple \"2 grilled chicken tacos\"....came on corn tortillas, which quite literally fell apart upon picking up.  It was all a big pile of disgusting on a tin foil wrapper.  I will be forgiving on the price since it was at the airport and nothing is reasonably priced there, but when you can't even do tacos that are edible then ya best pack your bags and move out.  After a day of good travel, it was this dreadful taco joint that simply ruined it.  Should have opted for the Smashburger next door.....hind sight."}
{"text":"You mean to tell me I not only spent $4 on a tostada, but spent 15 minutes waiting for it as well?

I ordered the Vampiro under the impression it would be quesadilla-esque. How I was wrong. Not only was there no cheese to be seen or for that matter tasted, but there was only the smallest dab of guacamole and onions. While the carne asada wasn't bad, by the time I walked back to my office, it was already cold.

The Vampiro was on the small side (for a tostada anyway) and not filling at all. Good thing I had some baby carrots in the office refrigerator.

And now I realize why the kid who took my order asked if that was really all I wanted. Here I thought he was just expecting me to be the Noah's Fat Ass Ark and order two of every menu item."}
{"text":"The food here is made fresh and is delicious. The chips were crispy and not oily. I had the vegetarian quesadilla. It was full of flavor and the hot salsa that is made fresh daily was like a blast of various veggies and spices all blending together in sync. I would recommend this place to those looking for fresh Mexican food that is not oily or overloaded with cheese which masks hidden flavors."}
{"text":"So...I tried it again....still not amazing. It's not terrible food, just not great. 

This past Sunday I went to the Coach House to watch the niners game. My friends and I drove up there and parked in the dirt parking lot which is connected to the Coach parking lot. My girlfriend and her friend went over the Taco shop and got some tacos and a burrito to go. We then all went into the Coach and enjoyed the game. A few hours later we went to get into our car and it was gone. Apparently America's Taco Shop had all the cars towed. The tacos here are not worth the $75 towing charge. I was a patron at this establishment and will NEVER go back. I am glad to see that other people on here had the same issue and are voicing their anger as well. 

America's Taco Company has made a fatal mistake. They should have put flyers on the cars warning people of the issue, not just had them towed. It could have been a great way for them to advertise their new location. Put a flyer on the cars that offers a free taco or something. Not everyone knows about this new place. Instead they decided to piss people off. They need to be careful who they piss off. The Coach House brings them a lot of business which will now be greatly diminished due to this. I used to tell people to just walk behind the bar and grab a taco. I will no longer be doing this. 

I do NOT recommend going to this place. 

Good Luck America's Taco Shop!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the location in Scotsdale so I grabbed a Bean Burrito here the other night.  First off it's the Mill's Food Court so there aren't a lot of vegetarian options to begin with, but my burrito was decent.  It was a bit on the cool, but not cold side as the cheese hadn't even melted by the time I had found a place to sit in the food court.  It still tasted pretty good and is much better than the other options here ( I know that's not saying much ).  I think if they keep the food hotter then it would be much better.  
I can't speak for the meat options here. The salsa seemed about the same as the other location so that's a plus.

So overall for the Food Court it's better than the other places, but if you want America's I would go to the Scotsdale Location it's much better."}
{"text":"Ate at the Coronado location today.  Had the Vampiro Pastor. The marinated pork was moist and tasty, reminiscent of Chinese roast pork (char siu), it was piled high with all the typical fixins, but the grilled pineapple was what put it over the top. So yummy, there's no need to put salsa on it.  

The special cerviche that's only available Fri & Sat, was awful. Tasted more like they served it the week before. Decor could use some sprucing up and beware of the bees if you plan on dining outside. Even though the ambiance and cerviche were below average, I'd take a drive to get more Vampiro Pastor."}
{"text":"Great place. We found out about this place initially by driving by as so many business have come and gone at this location the past 3 years. 
We sampled their tacos at the Duck and Decanter festival and went in the Friday after.  They had $1 mini pastor burritos (I think, as a European I have a hard time with Mexican food and what is called what)
Also had the $4 Margarita and was very good for the price. Nice tang and a good amount of alcohol for the price.
Will come back."}
{"text":"The best carne asada in town... my mouth waters every time I think about the carne asada burrito. This is a great little place to get a snack or lunch. Good prices and great food."}
{"text":"Everything I ordered was freshly made. Guacamole is excellent. I will be coming back for sure"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here the other night and I was impressed.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We added a change to our takeout order when we got there and they quickly fixed us up.  They have a cool outside area that seems like it would be fun to hand out and have a beer and a taco when they get it all finished up.

My Bean Burrito \"Terry's Style\"  was really good,t hey have very good tortillas and they have excellent guacamole.

I'll be back by when I am on that side of town.

Try:

- Bean Burrito \"Terry's Style\"
- Chips and Guacamole"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of the America's Taco in Scotsdale so I was pretty happy they opened one closer to the house. I only get one thing here. The Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's way and Guacamole and chips so take what you will from that.  The vegetarian quesadilla really needs to be rethought.  It's a cheese quesadilla with a bunch of onions and lettuce.  The plain old cheese one is much, much better.  The Beans are lard free and very good and an excellent quick lunch if you are vegetarian.  The staff here are very nice and the food comes out quickly.  They even have the option to order online and just pick it up. I am deducting one star for the quesadilla and the fact they ran out of beans one day and they didn't tell me till after I had ordered.  I had to get the vegetarian quesadilla which wasn't a very good substitute.

Try:
- Bean and Cheese Burrito Terry's Way
- Guacamole and Chips"}
{"text":"Me and my friends decided to try this place out due to all the great yelp reviews, but I was disappointed.  I got the carne asada tacos and chicken tacos, which were a $1 each because it was happy hour, and they tasted ok.  The food is very generic like a chain Mexican restaurant something like Baja Fresh,  The service was great and the place is pretty nice.  Just the food was average and wasn't satisfying."}
{"text":"Happy to stumble upon this place while looking for a munch on our way to a concert at the Marquee Theater. Really, REALLY good carne asada.  We had burritos, and the trio chip platter which includes chips, salsa and guacamole.  The guac and the carne were authentic with just the right amount of kick. You know you're at an authentic Mexican joint when they garnish your meal with a radish chunk. The price was fine, so I'm not sure about all the griping about being pricey.  The quality of meat makes up for being charged 50 cents more.  This place is a gem.  They have a limited menu, but what they do do is spot on delicious. Tasty to the mex, I mean max."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the Carne bowl, and the chicken quesadilla. Both were really good. The carne was delicious and just the right amount. They have really good salsas also. The quesadilla has a guacamole crema that was really tasty.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Stopped by Sunday for lunch as was pleasantly surprised. 

Had the chicken burrito and wife had the carne asada tacos. Both entrees were well done fresh and filling especially for the price. 

Please not that this is not the most authentic Mexican food that you can find. But at least from my experience it was fresh, quick and well done."}
{"text":"Came in for the elote and al pastor burrito. We were quickly greeted by a girl and Khai who was very helpful in assisting us with our selections in our ordering. We were also able to check in online using the Yelp app for a free order of chips and salsa so that was nice. 

The food arrived and didn't disappoint either! I love the elote (mexican street corn) here and the al pastor is some of the best in town. I also like that you can combo your favorite selections with rice and beans for a small upcharge. They have mexican coke in the bottle on ice as you step up to order so that is also something I like to see in your neighborhood taco shop. 

Overall-great food and great staff."}
{"text":"the price is not equal to the size...after finished the meal, i still felt hugry :("}
{"text":"False advertisement. Their menu on yelp shows cheaper prices than in the shop. Was looking for a cheap quick take out for a few tacos and walked in and their menu in store only sells taco plates with rice and beans, which is more expensive and I just wanted ala carte. They stated I couldn't buy it without the rice and beans because \"they're trying to sell more. \""}
{"text":"Okay, I'm going to have to recant my previous review. I just had a totally fantastic lunch of Torta Carne and corn on the cobb. That Torta is off the hook! I gobbled it up tomatoes and all and I flippin' hate tomatoes. The corn is slathered in buttery butter and cotija cheese, add a little pepper and it is sublime. 
Service was super fast. Call me Mary Kay but the two cuties behind the counter made the wait pretty tolerable. 
America, I'm sorry I snapped. I didn't know. I will be back for my Torta as it is now on my list of foods-I-want-every-day."}
{"text":"I am very saddened by the fact that they have moved locations. This was a great and convenient location for my commute home from work. I'll be stopping in every now and then at the new location but I'll be missing my (almost) weekly stop. 



Very friendly and welcoming staff members coupled with a nice indoor and patio dining area make for a very enjoyable dining experience.

The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. The portion sizes are a little smaller than I am used to, but preferred to the unnecessarily huge portions found at other nearby Mexican restaurants.

I would highly recommend the carne asada torta sandwich. I tried it after reading another user's review and I was not disappointed. The horchata is also some of the best I've had in town.

I have never enjoyed their happy hour specials but it seems like great deal with Mexican beers available for just $2."}
{"text":"I know they have another location in Phoenix, but I'm of course biased to this one! I can't imagine downtown without it! The building used to be a house which gives it a fun & comfy vibe. The inside is bright & colorful. The staff are laid back & easy to talk to & I don't think they've ever gotten my orders wrong. Oh, & the prices are so affordable! If you're a bean burrito person, definitely try them here! Homemade beans & the tortillas are legit! My husband is a picky eater with very high standards & this is one of his favorite places. I know I can always get dinner from here & he'll be happy!"}
{"text":"I flip back and fourth between the carne asada burrito and the bean & cheese. XL if I'm at \"fighting\" weight. I must admit, their beans are ethereal. My fiancé would marry them over me, if not already locked down by America's. To boot, their low-priced and large-portioned chips & salsa ($2 - Med spice) is the kind that I can't stop eating. I have yet to try the tortas, and was not as swooned by the tacos, but the burritos are as 5-star as the day is long."}
{"text":"OFF THE CHARTS! For simple fare and a small menu this place does it right every day, every order. A little outside the \"beaten path\" but worth the detour!
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was not sure what to expect. Regardless, the food was good and the staff was pleasant. Good move having pretty girls work in the front and the cooks in the back. The only Mexican feel I got was from the cooking staff in back who I occasionally saw. Good not great, continue supporting local businesses."}
{"text":"They definitely run the clock out here.  One thing at a time on the grill as fifteen people wait.  14 min wait time for a ten dollar burrito not worth it"}
{"text":"This is a fun little place for tacos and light Mexican fare. I had the ceviche and my husband had some tacos. The carne asada is some of the best I've had in the area. The ceviche was delicious. It wasn't overdone and loaded with unnecessary ingredients. Simplicity dominates the small menu at America's Taco Shop and the focus on quality is evident in the food. The best part is probably the price. Everything is so cheap! If you want a light lunch then you could get out of there for around four bucks but if you're really hungry drop a ten and unhinge your jaw. The hot sauce was also quite good. Very smokey and spicy. Great beer specials on the weekend!

The restaurant is small but they have nice little patio with misters. Perfect place to stop for lunch downtown. I'm excited to go back when I'm hungrier. Their burritos looked delicious."}
{"text":"Just stopped eating meat, and not because I don't like the taste... believe me, I miss this carne asada a lot... but it gave me a reason to try the bean and cheese burrito - DELICIOUS!  And it says there's no lard it in... I didn't know what to expect (I thought the lard was what gave the beans that buttery good flavor), but WOW - best bean and cheese burrito I've ever tasted!  Slightly different flavor, but it's wooonderful.  

That burrito, with the salsa that comes when you order chips, and a mexican bottled coke... preeetty much as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Still a consistent place for a unique bean and cheese burrito, a crave-worthy breakfast burrito, and a fresh tomato-and-cilantro-heavy salsa.

Many of the 2-star ratings focus on portion size and price, but for a regular meal made from scratch (not a super-sized gorge fest that is drive-thru Mexican), America's is a strong value; plus, you can meet the owners, unlike the corporate -berto's model.

They still need a bike rack though. -1 star."}
{"text":"They are known for their CARNE ASASDA and it  does rock but dang this place was nickle and diming me at every turn! 
 Everything is ala carte, and the tacos are so small,3 bites and its done.
For the price tag it should at least come with a small bag of chips.
Honestly the chips were so average it was disappointing. the salsa that comes with it was mediocre considering the hold out factor applied.   The salsa that came with my  tacos was exceptional, that should be their signature salsa for everything.
Sodas by the can, no refills,,geezzz,, another 3.00 bucks later.
I think I ended up spending over $12 for 3 small tacos and small basket of chips, and 2 sodas in z can. 
For that price,  I want more atmosphere or at least a 4 bite taco."}
{"text":"I don't care how good your burritos are, if you're going to sass me and make me wait 20 minutes past my scheduled pickup time. Once again, a franchised location devalues the America's brand. They aren't the same, and based upon the interaction with this gem of an employee today - the management doesn't care. If they did, they'd care about their hiring process more. No name tags - no care - no punishment. It's obvious. For the record, it's Scottsdale & you're at work, you don't need to get ghetto with me.

I loathe writing such negative reviews. Yelp is already full of them, written out of unfounded spite. I'm a lover of America's Taco Shop (I've hosted private parties at the old town location and given thousands of dollars to them - that kind of love) but this location isn't even the same brand. Shape up or shut your doors. Please."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go to the ones in Phoenix but especially like the one in old town Scottsdale. Great outdoor seating area...maybe not now that it's summer, but definitely all winter! Great to take your work team to for a casual lunch or just hang out and play some ping pong with a cool cerveza in hand. The pork tacos and burritos are good, but I'm personally a bigger fan of their carne asada burrito. Good flavor and great for a quick protein boost on the go. I love America's!"}
{"text":"One of the most important things in life is to live no more than a minute away from great Mexican fast food. I'm blessed to have America's Taco Shop fulfill that need. 

'Berto's beware, I'll never frequent you again thanks to the amazing Carne Asada at America's. The meat is freakishly tender and cooked to perfection. The grilled onions are the Cher to the meats' Sunny. Simply put, the Carne Asada burrito is damn good! 

The corn is a delight as well. I despise mayo and yet I still can't get past ordering the corn. Lightly coated in mayo then shellacked in cheese, with a spritz of lime and Cholula, the corn is to die (or kill) for. 

You'd think that two noteworthy items like these would be enough but NO! The true star of the shop is the beans. Light and flavorful they set the standard for beans everywhere. 

My sister is a little bit of a dirty redneck. When I mentioned that the beans were lard free she scoffed. I hate scoffing so I demanded that she try them. An hour later she was convinced, and properly apologetic. Thank you America's for giving me the rare win over a dirty redneck. 

America's is a great little shop in central Phoenix, and one that I will continue to frequent. Thanks for existing! 

NOTE: During peak hours the parking lot can be a little scary. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I've spent a lot time in Sonoran border towns, so I'm a snob when it comes to tacos. Most, if not all, chain restaurants will not get 5 star ratings from me. 

That being said, I really enjoyed the Al Pastor tacos here. The stronger pineapple flavor is a good change from the standard Pastor I get at other restaurants. More sweet than spicy...kinda reminds me of a taco you'd get in Hawaii...it's refreshing! Aside from the tacos, I also had chips and salsa. The chips were fresh and crisp. Mild salsa was just that...very mild. Next time I'll go with spicy. Overall, a very good meal and I'm already craving more of their Pastor...which means I'll be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I feel like I can live here. It's in an old house with a cool backyard \"patio\" setup for dining. I've never eaten my food there but I've taken it home many times and it's consistently delicious. Consistency is the key word there. My girlfriend and I tried a different America's location (off the 101 and Via de Ventura) and it didn't taste the same so we won't be going back there. The adoba pork is made just like gyro meat but with a pineapple that adds a fantastic sweetness you can't find anywhere else. My gf loves the carne asada and asks for it quite often while we're just sitting around the apartment. Our order always consists of one taco and one burrito each plus a side of beans. She goes for the carne asada burrito and adoba taco and I like to switch back and forth. We only recently discovered this location and have been there at least five times in the past month, highly recommended for somebody who wants to pass by the often rundown taqueria for a fantastic alternative."}
{"text":"Get the carne asada torta.  Then go back the next day and get the carne asada burrito. Don't forget the chips and guacamole!  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"One of the worst Mexican restaurants I have ever eaten at. Six of us went out to eat for a quick bite and this was the restaurant we chose.  We all sampled each other's food, and I can tell you that I was not impressed with anything that I tried from all 6 please. I will never return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Wonderful service, generally good environment. Not too cluttered. The food was good, and I felt full after eating but not bloated. I really will come again!"}
{"text":"I moved into the neighborhood a year ago and I'm so sorry it took me this to stop by. Delicious tacos! Definitely going into my weekly rotation."}
{"text":"Great food, but small portions. I always leave still hungry.  If I order enough to make me full, I've spent 20 bucks just on my meal."}
{"text":"I wish you guys continued success... please take the time to keep it that way, it helps all of us as a community.. Take pride in it and it will reward you ten fold."}
{"text":"So dissapointed :(  This use to be my favorite place when I felt home sick but the last two times I have been there the meat was burnt. It seems like now that they are more popular and expanding they don't care about serving burnt food."}
{"text":"I guess I shouldn't be surprised by a place named \"america's taco shop.\" This was pretty awful. Should just rename it Tacos by Sysco©"}
{"text":"Is that all there is? That was my thought when I received my order of three tacos. I've seen these shops for years, and finally decided to give it a try, but unfortunately was extremely disappointed. The tacos were tiny, but not much different in price than other locations and still more than a taco truck would charge. While it's a cute location, the amount of food for the money doesn't make it worth returning.

If you're in the area and looking for good tacos may I suggest heading to Diego Pops, Barrio Queen or Mr. Mesquite. You'll spend the same amount of money and you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the bean and cheese burritos and guacamole! Delicious lemonade and horchata too!!"}
{"text":"Best Taco Place I've been to! It was so tasty! I got the Carne Asada Quesadillas and they were delicious, as well as the salsa that came with it. And the ambiance was very nice. It was clean and the people there were kind. I definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Carne Asada Burrito. Staff was great and helpful and lots of smiles!  Chips and salsa are good too. Will be regular part of our work lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the Bean Burro, to the tune of once a week.  This is also in my neighborhood, so I want to support them as much as I can.  This food is NOT fast-food Mexican, nor is it typical greasy Sonoran.  The menu is small, but tasty.  In addition to the bean burro, I highly recommend the ceviche (weekends), the carne asada, and the salsas.  For a more genuine experience, order a Margarita, Mexican coke, or one of the fruit drinks made fresh on the premises.  Sit outside, enjoy the weather, bob your head to the music, and all will be well....I promise."}
{"text":"Not sure where to even start with this place. Same mall as Yogi's and Culver's on the south side of Ray just west of the 101. Been meaning to try them and finally did. I got here after the lunch rush - about 1:30 or so and the staff here seemed to be completely OVERWHELMED. Not sure why because there weren't a whole lot of people. I wanted something \"Al Patron\" but was informed that it wasn't ready yet so please order either chicken or carne asada. Ok... so I ordered a carne asada burrito and elote - or as they call it here: America's Corn. So I first went to the salsa bar and wait - there WAS no salsa bar! Ok. Weird. Whatever. Sat down and chilled while waiting for my order. Other customers also put in their orders and also sat down to wait. And Wait. And wait. And wait. And Wait. And wait. And wait. Holy Chicken Molé batman! I ordered a simple burrito not a freaking Thanksgiving turkey that still needed thawing! FFS! So I watched various staff members run around delivering people's orders in frantic movements like I was watching some cross between a food-based reality show and one of those crazy Japanese game shows where people run around trying to perform tasks without slamming into each other. A Chinese fire drill basically. At least it helped pass the time since I didn't feel like playing that stupid game on my mobile device where you play angry muslim terrorist suicide bombers disguised as birdheads crashing into buildings and recreating 911 for every different level with the goal of killing every Yankee capitalist pig with the wreckage of an imploding building. Ok. Maybe that really isn't what the game is about but I was getting ravenous and started hallucinating like crazy. Then the burrito finally came! Oh joy! I noticed it was long but not very thick (that's what she said [rimshot], [cymbal crash]) - so there was really more tortilla than anything else. The meat tasted like it was marinated. Yup. But that's about it. Then I ate the corn. Squirted some lime over the cotija and took a few bites. Sorta bland. A bit of salt might have helped. There was some spicy sauce but that's not what I usually have over elote. Meh. At any rate I felt the food wasn't worth the price AND the long wait even though I was quite hungry. I was, in a word, UNDERWHELMED. Probably equal to the amount the staff seemed to be OVERWHELMED. So that's my take on America's Tacos. Checked off my \"try this place\" list but didn't make it to column B - the \"hey I need to come back to this place again for sure!\" list. But you don't have to take my word for it, Reading Rainbow fans! Check it out for yourselves. Your mileage may vary..."}
{"text":"This is the best location in Phoenix and second is the 16th and Camelback location. I always get the carnet asada burrito or a carne asada taco with bean burrito. It's delicious every time! 

Food is consistent and good. The beans are amazing!"}
{"text":"Nothing makes me happier than to see that this terrible establishment has finally closed!! This review is about a year after the fact, but what the heck.. America's Taco Shop was responsible for one of the worst 72hr periods of my life. I made the mistake of eating here after class and became deathly ill. So sick in fact that I was taken to the hospital and treated for \"Staph Food Poisoning\" which specifically comes from food that has been allowed to gather bacteria in an unsanitary kitchen environment and from food that is being kept well below the required temperatures.15lbs of vomit and $1000s later i was released back society. Considering this shit shack has now become a local chain I will take any means necessary to avoid their toxic food and meal preparation practices. Unless you want to see exactly how much vomit can come from your body... i suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Americas! Love this place to get a quality burrito or some awesome tacos! Great place to meet up with friends. Great after workout meal!"}
{"text":"Everybody raves about the carne asada and pastor, but we go for the bean and cheese burritos (no lard!), vegetarian quesadilla, and (for me) corn on the cob.  My kids are especially crazy about the bean and cheese burritos, and my youngest loves the vegetarian quesadilla -- flour tortilla with monterey jack cheese, lettuce, caramelized onions, guacamole. Corn on the cob is sweet white corn, lite mayo, cotija cheese, chili, lime.  Salsa is tasty and fresh -interestingly, it gets spicier if you leave it in the fridge overnight.  (Guac is just ok, in my opinion.) Also, order online for quick service.  For those wondering about the \"America's\" name, that's the name of one of the owners: http://www.americastacoshop.net/about"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was prepared in a quick manner. I have a trio tacos which were delicious but lacking a little bit of flavor. Noting  against the place just must down to preference"}
{"text":"The Best Authentic Mexican America\"s Taco Shop!  The staff & all the food are to die for!"}
{"text":"Staff was Great... But, the food not as tasty (tacos/burritos - it had no flavor unless you put hot sauce on everything) & to me, it was not authentic as the store down University."}
{"text":"2nd visit - returned upon request of the gracious owner Terry.  Had a carne asada taco and bean burrito.  

I have to say my vision of carne asada previously was narrow.  Down home carne asada from the streets was all I knew.  America's Taco Shop has broadened my carne asada horizons for the following reasons:

_Carne asada can have quality, proper cut, and flavor.  It can taste leaner, less greasy.
_Refried beans can be free of lardo and theirs are some of the best I've ever had.
_If you use a good tortilla to wrap their tacos and burritos, it's a sign you care.
_While the expected accompaniments may not be present, who doesn't love caramelized onions and lettuce on a taco.

SO, lets take America's for what it is..a slightly upscale carne asada experience.  

Yes, you will pay up more dough for less during this experience, but its one that needs to be had.  I will be back to America's because there will come a time when I want a more quality, lean, cleaner meal, which we all know you can't get on the \"streets\".

{"text":"On a referral write-up we read in a well received Phoenix Food publication, my Fiance & I put America's Taco Shop on our list of 'must visits,' as we both absolutely LOVE great Mexican Food. Consequently, after some time lapse from the date of reading the esteemed recommendation of this Shop having 'THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley,' we FINALLY visited and experienced their food last night for dinner.  We ordered 2 Carne Asada Burritos (regular size) and 2 Carne Asada Tacos, just as they are prepared, unmodified.  The tacos are without a doubt good.  However, they are standard Asada street tacos in size and with garnishing.  Outside of happy hour times, these Asada tacos are sold at $2.35 each, not at all a good value, however, during happy hour, they're only $1.00 a piece, which is appropriate, relative to what one receives in portion.  The burritos, when ordered in the regular size, can easily be referred to and identified as a junior sized burrito, which will set you back about $6.00 a piece...This is UNHEARD of in the Valley, where GREAT MEXICAN FOOD abounds and is generally offered at a very good value.  Not the case here.  Food was good, but certainly NOT THE GREATEST CARNE ASADA in the Valley...Not even marginally.  Needless to say, my Fiance and I were equally disappointed with our findings.  Therefore, we will not return nor recommend America's Taco Shop as a 'must visit' Asada stop to any of our friends or colleagues; UNLESS one finds themselves in an unusual bind and it's happy hour time...Then buy all means, take your dollar bills and order the Asada tacos and a Margarita then call it an afternoon.  Should you be looking for a REAL MEXICAN FOOD experience with highly anticipated supreme flavors and substantial portions, do yourself a favor and pass on this place."}
{"text":"Sorry to hear this location is closed, I will have to go to one of the other ones. I wanted to write a review (better late than never) for when I was last there July 23rd, 2014. I ordered tacos, and I took away my order only to discover it was wrong when I got to the location where I  was going to eat my lunch. The staff made it RIGHT! Instead of 2 tacs, they gave me 3! And threw in an little extra side. The staff at this location had always rocked and made things right whenever something went sideways. 
I will, of course, search out their other locations so I can continue to patronize them - the food is great and the service always makes me feel welcome and wanted - this was a great location to kick back with a cold drink, good food and good company."}
{"text":"The price was reasonable for a veggie quesadilla, but I would probably not visit this place again. The food didn't seem fresh, and seemed to be almost \"fast foodish\"

Worth the price though. 3.00 veggie quesadilla, cool!"}
{"text":"I like the spin of a traditional taste in a fast food joint type atmosphere. This did not have a drive thru but I felt it may do well with one. The guacamole was fresh and tasted great. The horchata it fresh as well but let it settle for awhile as it can get super grainy once they stir it and pour it for you."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sad I don't live as close to here as I used to. I'm sure my waistline is happy, though! 
America's has delicious bean burritos! The beans are creamy, cheese perfect and wrapped up in a very fresh tortilla. I hear the Carne is really good (But I obviously haven't tried it). Salsa is okay. I like a little more spice, but I guess at the temp it is I am able to load more on a chip without breaking out into a giant sweat. 
We usually did takeout, but the inside is cute. It's incredibly tiny as well, so I recommend the patio if you eat here unless you like people waiting for to-go orders standing like sardines pressed against you while you are trying to eat. 
The menu is small and limited. They serve beer. The prices are good. 
Give it a try! It's not the kind of place you go on a date to or plan an evening for, but for lunch or a quick dinner on a busy day it's perfect!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and lived in San Diego for about 5 years so its fair to say that I've eaten at a lot of Mexican food restaurants and taco shops. This place has one of the best carne asad burritos I've ever had. Everything is fresh and the tortillas are always soft and never stale or hard. The quesadillas a little bland though. Some pico de gayo would add some flavor or maybe cilantro tossed in."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good, a little over priced. They have a happy hour where a few things are a little cheaper but they keep switching it around and it's not posted so hard to follow and bad business if you ask me. I think they just keep switching it around to throw you off, very annoying."}
{"text":"I am not quite sure what all the fuss is about. I found this place to be extremely overpriced and the food was just ok. My husband and I stopped by for a mid-week lunch and while he enjoyed his carne asada tacos, my quesadilla was served on a flour tortilla the size of a small corn tortilla and I subsequently had to order 4 baskets of chips to supplement my lunch. The salsa was good but why charge for chips and salsa? I could go to any other Mexican restaurant and get them for free and next time I will."}
{"text":"Fuck this place. What a joke. 

Tried them out because we had an Amazon Restaurants coupon. I had heard they were good from a magazine review or maybe a friend awhile back. Nevertheless, we ordered without checking reviews. Whoops!

Ordered an XL burrito, a taco sampler and a side of rice and beans, for $16. 

What showed up was a pitiful collection of sad, below Taco Bell quality food. 

The burrito was small for an XL; I was expecting something made in a manhole sized tortilla like any Mexican grocery store will make for the same price. It was filled with gummy, mushy rice, and a few scraps of some kind of chewy, flavorless meat. Total waste, into the trash it went after one bite.

The tacos were laughable. Store bought tortillas that had the consistency and taste of wet paper. The filling in each was garbage. Some kind of meat (all terrible, overcooked, chewy, one had a nasty, cinnamon-allspice type taste to it, ick!), a few onions and a small dab of what they must call guacamole. 

The side cups were each slightly less than half full. Beans were 80% gloppy goo, 100% flavorless. The rice was the same gummy junk in the burrito. Trash. 

For $16, I expect something better than shit I just have to throw away. I would be embarrassed to put out food this unappetizing and low end for the price. 

Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I have to come here every time I visit Phoenix.  I am not usually a big fan of Bean & Cheese burritos, but that is what I always order here, something about their beans is so different and so delicious!  I also love the chips and salsa and their iced tea.  If you are in Phoenix, they have several locations, you should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I tried the Carne asada and grilled chicken tacos, the meat in both tacos were kinda bland and the pork wasn't ready for my lunch time visit. My wife had the bean & cheese burrito, she says it was okay but a little salty."}
{"text":"Great place for \"street tacos\" at a good price. It actually feels like you in Mexico when you eat here and the food is fantastic! I'm not sure how their franchised shops are, but the 7th Ave spot is a favorite stop!

The pastor is fantastic and their breakfast burritos are legendary! Worth a stop if your in the area or looking for a good taco shop at a decent price.  Food is so fresh that if they run out, thats it, order something else or come back tomorrow."}
{"text":"If you have never been here THEN GET YOURSELF THERE NOW!!! parking is weird and very busy street but I would throw my truck in the middle of the street just to eat here. Not Dirt cheap but not at all pricey, and service is awesome!! Went with pastor and Carne asada tacos! chips and salsa were awesome too! Sad THAT ISN'T ANY RICE!! BUT GREAT BEANS! Then we grabbed one of America's corns to go...  awwww everything was awesome! the sweet taste of the Pastor was sooooo perfect. PASTOR FOR LIFE!!! AND there is a cool squirrel outside that they have yet to name!!!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in phoenix!

1. Simple Menu
2. Great flavors in the carne asada.
3. Ceviche is great.
4. Horchata is fantastic!

p.s. If you want to catch a game the location on 7th ave has a TV."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.  It's not for everyone, though.  Some of my friends want the typical \"mexican food\" experience and this is just a simple place that does a few things very well.

Tacos.  Amazing.  Bean burros.  Amazing.  Guac.  Amazing.  

A great place to pick up dinner from a long day at work."}
{"text":"I agree the food is OK, not the Best not the worst. Service is really kind of slow like everyone there is new at their jobs but that's not the case, it's just slow.

You can tell you're being nickeled and dimed by a place that sells Mexican food if they don't give you at least a small portion of nachos with your food.... COME ON!


I blame these problems on the owner,bmanagement and whoever designed the place!
The flow and ergonomics of the food preparation area just seems Slow. and cumbersome... Get somebody in there  to improve the design of the place and get better service"}
{"text":"NOT the same as the original locations. Food was not hot and just doesn't taste the same.  Dissatisfied. Very."}
{"text":"No beer here with your Asada burrito, but more importantly you can't even order potatoes at 10 o'clock in the morning with your breakfast burrito? This is my fourth time being told nope sorry no more potatoes. At breakfast time? So I can call the other two restaurants and I can get it. I'd give it tjia 7st negative star in service if I could. Done. Will be ordering and picking up at the others, even though I only live a block from you."}
{"text":"Work nearby and plan to frequent this restaurant. My order was accurate and I wasn't left waiting. Don't even get me started on how good the food is!"}
{"text":"Awesomely delicious pastor tacos and carne asada burritos! Nuff said, go get yourself some :)"}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon the place when I looking for a burger place.  So I thought I'd give it a try.  I had the Carne Asada burrito.   For $6 I expected a much larger burrito than I got.   I thought it would have shredded beef.   No, just kind of munched up beef.  Taco Bell has better burritos than this.  It was ok at best.  For some reason they give you a tiny sliver of lime and even tinier piece of radish.  Not enough to do anything with.
Go down to Rudy's to see how a real burrito is done."}
{"text":"Great carne asada. Loved the tacos, burritos and nachos. The restaurant was clean. Customer service was excellent. This was our first time eating here but we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"First time at Americas Taco Shop. Fist time review on Yelp! I should have checked Yelp before I ordered, I now see you can get free chips and salsa. Customer service was GREAT! Food.... Was offered a sample of the meat before we ordered. Good size taco, reg size carne Asada quesadilla and a margarita with chips and salsa put us back about 16 bucks plus a tip (which was well deserved). The food was amazing and quality....frankly it will stand up to any Mexican taco shop or restaurant. And I grew up on homemade beans and tortillas. Salsas were average at best, but.... they had Tapatio!Margarita... Excellent. Menu....simple (not 73 items to choose from). Restaurant clean, Mexican music playing, overall great first time experience. And looks like they have daily specials. We will be back. And again I cannot stress the quality of the service I received. Very refreshing."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Not great but I will returb. I had the chicken taco and Carne amada taco. To go order, they wrapped all 3 tacos together so when you opened them the tortillas stuck together making them rip or break. They come with salsa on the side. With the meat you get lettuce? Or shredded cabbage ? On the taco, I'm not sure but I think they'd be better with onions cilantro mix Instead. The salsa isn't that great, pretty bland. Great atmosphere and very clean. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place after many recomendations. Not too bad. Had the carne Asda tacos. Tacos were good, loaded grilled beef on corn tortillas with a little onion and gaucamole. Wanted a side of chips and gaucamole, however be warned they only have one option available that is an 8oz serving with chips for about $6. A little pricey, but tasty.
Store was busy, however server was extremely friendly and explained the menu as it was my first time."}
{"text":"Not the Americas Taco Shop that my family loves. Terrible, terrible service and unimpressive preparation of our favorite items."}
{"text":"Holy good tacos, Batman.  I loooove Mexican street tacos. I want to bathe in guacamole and dip myself in hot sauce.  OK, maybe not quite that extreme, but I really enjoyed my experience here.  First I am not from PHX and I am so jealous that you all get to eat outside in April.  My town is cold and frigid so it was such a treat to have our first meal in this town outdoors at a picnic table with a Dos Equis.  I enjoyed the carne asada and pork tacos.  The steak was my favorite, tender and fabulously cooked.  I loved the corn tortillas.  The guac was wonderful and a tasty add on that everyone must try!  The food came out fast and was inexpensive.  This is a great place to enjoy some friendly chatter over fabulously delicious food."}
{"text":"Not impressed tonight. We ordered a 3 burritos, 5 tacos, 2 quesidillas to go. The only item that was warm was a breakfast burrito. Everything else was stone cold. All the food was packed tightly together so everything should have been piping hot.

Flavor is good but I was very disappointed in the quality of the food that was served. 

I tried this place earlier this week ordering just 2 tacos,  and they were good then."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative star I would but I figure 1 is more if an insult how, if the meat is warm? Can you serve a cold burrito I have given this place 2 chances and I advise everyone please please don't stop at the 16 at location keep going to 7 st or 7 ave locations so very disappointed ted I. This location give the name a bad reputation!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to ATS yet, then get going!  The carne asada and al pastor are some of the best in town."}
{"text":"When I first started coming here a couple of years ago, there were just three locations, and the carne asada was my little secret.  Now they've got a handful of locations, and are expanding the franchise.  This location (Ray and 101) feels more \"corporate\", but the food is just as good as the hole-in-the-wall original locations.

The carne asada is still pretty good, but my new favorite is the al pastor (pork).  It's fantastic, you have to try it.  And don't forget to check in on yelp to get some free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"An emerging chain with fast, quality Mexican food. Somewhat like Chipotle but different menu. Tacos are good, but I have the Carne Asada Torta every time I go since I've tried one. Very, very good."}
{"text":"awesome carne asada tacos and corn on the cob with cheese some lime juice and good ole tapito hot sauce...oh and margs. all day chillin out on the patio"}
{"text":"So disappointed with this location. I am a regular visitor to the store at the 101 and Via de Ventura. I've given this location two chances. After tonight's visit, I will not be going back. 

Both of the burritos I ordered to go were COLD - we heated them up at home. My husband is consistently disappointed with the size of the burritos and what you get for the price, especially for having to pay extra for cheese and sour cream. They threw one small green and one small red salsa in my bag for two burritos. The location I frequent offers regular, spicy & green and asks you what salsa(s) you want for each order.

From my understanding, each location is franchised, and really hope this owner steps up their game!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how authentic the food would be but they really hit the mark with fresh mexican street food.  Their tacos and burritos are loaded with flavor and fresh ingredients and oh so affordable."}
{"text":"Just ate here, fast, friendly, had an Al Pastor Burrito.  It was divine!  Worth to stop for a meal.

SJ"}
{"text":"Good food and quick service.  The portions are a little smaller than what I would like, but I used a coupon, so the price was fair.
My favorite item is the Corn On the Cob."}
{"text":"Al Pastor - with JUST cilantro and raw onion. - Don't let anyone tell you there is another way to eat these orgasms in your mouth. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"If there are 3 1/2 stars, i would give them that. The good? - Authentic Tacos Al Pastor on the gyro spit. The bad? What the hell are they filling the tacos up with crap for??? People, let me give you a tip - 86 the guacamole 86 the 'cabbage' (cabbage? really?? wtf???) just do the meat, the cilantro and chopped onion. Put some salsa to taste, and a lime, i personally love the lime on it, but some only add a little. Pineapple (ONLY if requested) and THEN you have a REAL taco Al pastor. 

Once I requested the 'traditional' style - it was just as good as one i would get in Mexico City - albeit the meet was a little on the toasty side (turn the burner DOWN!)

Didn't eat anything else there - finally found the first al-pastor on the spit place in north America. I sense an Al pastor revolution cometh."}
{"text":"Food is still good, but the customer service and attention to detail on several recent occasions has been lacking.  They forgot at least one item the last couple times and instead of being apologetic and immediately making the item, they wasted time confirming that we actually ordered it.  Disappointing.  Not sure we will be visiting this location again soon..."}
{"text":"Good food. I had the carne asado burrito.  It was pretty good.  The meat was chopped pretty finely so don't expect steak chunks.   I also had their unsweetened passion fruit iced tea.   It was also good.   The chips and  salsa are average.  The \"extra spicy\" salsa was OK but not very spicy.   In all the meal cost me $16.00 including $3.00 tip.  I'd say the pricing is average.  The value is a bit less than average.   The small patio with umbrellas and water misters is a nice touch.  There is limited indoor seating with AC.   This shop is in a really convenient location.  The place has  a mostly authentic atmosphere and the staff was nice.

I'll go back to try a different meal to be sure I'm not missing anything.   A lot of people like this shop and I had a few recommend it to me.    Give it a try."}
{"text":"America's is a consistently good place to grab a burro or tacos. Today I called in a take out order. The woman who took my order asked if I was aware that the Melrose Street Fair was taking place, and I totally forgot. The great employee gave me directions to avoid the traffic and road closures. Even better, she told me to call when I got there, and they would run out to my car with my order. What great service! Where else does this happen?

Food wise, the food is good, and chips and salsa are nice. I think the salsa could use  a little work, and could be hotter, with some more zip. Along the same lines, the guacamole seems to be getting a little watered down, and the consistency is more liquidy, almost like they were getting low on avocados, so they diluted it? Not a deal breaker, just different from usual

I totally recommend this spot, and if they can just tweak the salsa so the hot salsa is HOT, and not designed for the Sun City crowd."}
{"text":"Adios America's. 

Not sure what happened here, but I'm guessing they expanded too rapidly and quality control was over looked. 

Picked up some food to-go today. Ordered a carne asada burrito and a \"trio\" which is chips, guac, and salsa. 

Getting back to the office, after three bites of the burrito I bit down and something rock hard was in the burrito- so that was fun. Several bites later the same thing happened, and as much as I love my dentist- I'm not in a hurry to see him- so I had to throw away my burrito. Now onto the $7.00 side order of chips (which literally were 80% broken into tiny pieces) and salsa with no flavor profile whatsoever. 

I really liked this spot- and hope they can get it together. Quality matters, and that will make or break you. 

Why not have an option of chips and Guac like Chipolte? $2.50 and done, instead of $7.00 for flavorless salsa, broken chips- and decent guac. 

I wish this place the best- and hope they can do better."}
{"text":"The staff is so nice and so friendly every time that I go there. Their food is also really good and I love their horchata. I love their beans, not very many places make beans that I like but I keep coming back for theirs. I went there one night with a couple girlfriends and they brought our food out to us, and they kept checking on us when they didn't need to and went above and beyond for us while we were there. Definitely a great place!"}
{"text":"Tasty, good tacos, but not unbelievable. If I could give it a 3.75 I would because I feel that is the most accurate rating. The chips and salsa were not the best, but the tacos were good."}
{"text":"Four words: Bean and cheese burritos. [Some more words:] They are truly the best I've ever had, and that's saying something, because b&c burritos are one of my favorite comfort foods. The beans here are so creamy, and the tortilla is perfect.  Seriously, I crave this burrito all the time. 

I also love their cochata (iced coffee + horchata!) and chips and salsa. Call me basic -- I don't care.

Their tacos are great but tiny. Their pastor meat is carved right off of one of those huge rotisserie things like you'd see at the taco stands in Mexico. LEGIT.

This is the original location in a historical little bungalow, and still has the soul and character that are lacking at the franchises. The staff here is friendly and cool, and it's just all around an awesome place."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite spot for Mexican food.  They have the best tacos in town, and great ceviche (offered Friday and Saturday). 

The jamaica is amazing!"}
{"text":"First off, do not expect the parking to go your way.  IT SUCKS!  However, the carne asada tacos are very worth the hassle.  Honestly, parking only sucks when you go during the busy times.  Hands down so of the best food and customer service I have received."}
{"text":"Two visits in two days, but in different locations. The food court choices all looked bad, but I had remembered hearing about this Taco Shop and since I'm a huge carne asada fan, here we go. The carne in my burrito was tasty, had some crunch too it and from what I can tell no fatty pieces were involved. The $6 small burrito had carmelized onions and guac and a tasty spicy salsa was served on the side. Might be the best carne in this mall, but I went to another location the next day and didn't have the best breakfast burro. That burrito was from the University Drive restaurant and the carne did have some fatty pieces here and the potatoes they used for the breakfast burros were too small and chopped up and the whole thing just didn't come together well. KInd of greasy and just average. Hopefully, the mall court comes through again on my next visit because good carne is tough to find."}
{"text":"SO bummed that they don't offer Sour Cream in their restaurants.."}
{"text":"Let me preface this fact: I have eaten what could amount to a family of cows (that would be daddy cow, momma cow and 2.5 child cows) in carne asada during my life. Needless to say I like it. This doesn't make me an MD in C.A. but I've had really good (i.e. Yeah, I loved it so much I'd marry it.) and really bad (i.e. Truly thought I'd die.) and everything in between.

That said I'd place America's Taco shop squarely in the middle. Again, it's just my opinion but it was really nothing special. Maybe, and I say MAYBE, I was slightly thrown by the hype and was expecting too much.

That alone though wouldn't have merited my two stars. I eat at plenty of places with just-okay quality of food but I go back because of the atmosphere or service. But the fact that the wait was over 30 minutes for two tacos, a vampiro and a burrito was part of it.

Also, the help was less than, um, help. Two teenagers with that wonderful teen-approach to service. Example, not knowing exactly what an item includes. Lastly, the prices. A vampiro at most places is the size of a good portioned tostada. At A.T.S. however everything down to the burrito was half the size of what I expected, and pricier. I understand the tacos being small as is traditional for carne asada tacos but don't price them $3 a pop. I could get the same quality and half the price at Food City (no joke).

The seating was really limited so this place would probably be best for a pick-up order to avoid the wait.

The positives were that that the food came exactly as I'd ordered it and also they served elote (corn) traditional style which you don't see much outside of late night taco stands. Also, the place was clean and the small house it was built into was neat."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are for the breakfast burrito I get which is good. But they definitely get ZERO stars for the customer service. Same girl at cash register everytime with no greeting, no smile, no personality even when I cheerily say hello and ask her how she is and leave by wishing her a good day. Doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"I was at the America's in Old Town tonight where I've been several times over the last couple years.  First, I have to say the other America's around town are awesome and seem to care about making their customers happy.  Tonight, I ordered a Ranchero breakfast burrito and a small drink.  The \"girl\" behind the counter was SUPER rude and overcharged me by $2.00.  I was going to wait to get the receipt and point out her error however immediately after the receipt printed she took it and crumpled it only to throw it in the trash behind her.  When she brought me my food she said \"here you go\" and throws the basket on my table.  Why are people so needlessly rude ?"}
{"text":"Saw in Phoenix Magazine that the carne asada torta made the the \"best\" sandwiches list so I headed out to see for myself along with three friends.  Um, not so much.  Dry meat, bread/meat ratio favors the bread, and other ingredients didn't have much flavor.  Just barely ok."}
{"text":"I love Americas! The bean and cheese burritos are bomb. 

Customer service has always been good and my food always comes out right and at a timely manner."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant but as a single mom who runs her own business, pretty appalled at the attitude I got from the young snob behind the counter. She works for minimum wage for a reason, I suppose. The soda machine is not working and they only have expensive bottled sodas available. She couldn't even offer me an ice water. It's June, and it's going to be 109° today, I'm traveling with my six-year-old and four-year-old and have a lot of business to get done. I'm glad I changed my mind about eating here.  I don't spend my hard-earned money at places like this and these are the types of people that make it difficult to defend Scottsdale in general.  I'll head back to Gilbert where people are nice to each other."}
{"text":"This place is the perfect neighborhood walk to place on a weekend. The food is amazing, they even added chicken to their menu! My one and only criticism is that the beer is warm. I would suggest on their busy nights (Fri, Sat, Sun) they get an ice chest and put their beer in that. They are serving it too fast for the fridge to keep up. Other than that, awesome!!"}
{"text":"We went into this location randomly and it payed off! I ordered the taco trio and every taco had a great amount of flavor . Very authentic street tacos. There chips and guacamole are a must have !"}
{"text":"Disgusting staff and disgusting food. Anytime you see teenagers working alone leave asap. They took my order, but the dumb cook didn't listen. The breakfast burrito is possibly the worst version in America. Some kind of goopy cheese, undercooked eggs and nothing else in this nasty waste of 4 bucks."}
{"text":"Miserable carne asada. True garbage served to me this past week.that my dog (if I had one) would not even eat. Numerous fatty pieces of carne asada inside my tiny $7 small burrito. I had maybe two good bites and then things started falling apart with fat chunk 1 and 2, etc. I unwrapped the burro and dumped the contents out and all you see is white fat. Who is in charge of quality control at this dump or maybe America (she is a woman) just thinks that tons of fat belong in carne? Wrong. This was a performance worthy of deportation and a visit by Sheriff Joe. Send the Carne back to Mexico por favor."}
{"text":"I ordered the taco trio so I could try one of each. The carne asada and chicken taco were very good as well as both salsas. I did not care for al Pastor. I've never had it before so have nothing to compare it to, but the meat was dried out. I was really looking forward to that one because it sounded good. I will give the place one more try before writing it off. I'd like to try the quesadilla and the horchata that another reviewer recommended. The inside looked clean and the chairs were comfortable. Most places don't have cushioned seats, this one does."}
{"text":"Being so close to my office, ATS was one spot I wanted to check out as soon as I saw it on Yelp. Walking in, you really have to love the layout. Another \"restaurant in a house\", the Shop has a very breezy open feel, with not a lot of seating. It was early, only 5pm, so there weren't many customers. Without a wait, I was able to walk right up and order a carne asada burrito. BurrITO. I emphasize the \"ito\", because when I got home, I realized they gave me a burro. Honestly, I didn't know the difference, so I can't be too upset.

Biting into the burro, I immediately agreed with their motto; it really is the best carne asada I have had in town. Great flavor, a little salty, and the texture is perfect. The wrap was perfect; little bit of added flavor, but thick as well (which is essential with the juice from the carne asada). I only had two issues, and one may just be due to the mistaken order. The burro only had the meat and the pico de gallo, so it was a little boring. Delicious, but boring. Also, as others noted, it's pricy. Even without a tip, the XL burro was about $9, and you got something smaller than a Chipotle burrito. Once again, delicious, but a few bucks more than I would have liked to pay.

Long story short, the meat is delicious, and it's well worth trying out. I will certainly go back to try a burrito, and will try to enunciate my words a little more!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have el pastor in the us. Unfortunately this was not that good. The corn totilla was hard and dry and there was very little meat. Oops. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Outstanding, clean and welcoming atmosphere. Love the place and the service."}
{"text":"LOVE this place (all locations)!! I am addicted to their beans and tortillas. Not the best carne asada I've had in my life but I love this place! Super fast and everything I've had there is delicious."}
{"text":"Food quality has gone down. Ordered a pastor burrito and there was a small amount of meat with mouthfuls of tortilla. This place used to be excellent now there portions are half the size. Also the burrito had big chunks of fat in it."}
{"text":"Went there with my group of bff's and we were extremely excited to try out this new place when it had barely opened. Unfortunately, I later realized that their prices made me feel like I had spent more than what I bargained for.  Way too much hype surround this place.

I had their carne asada quesadilla and carne asada tacos, the meat lacked flavor and none of the salsas were hot enough. It borders on authentic but it didnt do the trick for me. Plus the art inside looks too much like Rubio's, too bad its more expensive than Rubio's. 

By the way, most of this food is available south of this establishment around 16th St and Van Buren in roach coaches for a much cheaper price and with salsas que de veras valen la pena y pican."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst meal I have had while visiting Arizona!! My suggestion is \"don't go\""}
{"text":"Not good. Beans tasted like they were out of a can, rice from a box. Tacos were passable, but bland. AVOID the bowls - filled with the afore-mentioned beans & rice. The \"guac' was a green sauce, runny and squirted out of a plastic bottle. The topper - they \"lost\" their liquor license and are \"trying to get it back\", so no cerveza aqui. No bueno. Save yourselves, RUN!"}
{"text":"Can't get enough! Everything is delicious and doesn't feel heavy! I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Mexican food and americas taco shop has it figured out. They are quick, affordable, and clean. My experience has always been great. My favorite is the carne Asada burrito and grilled chicken tacos. The staff is friendly and the tables are always clean which is rare for a quick service restaurant. 

Will continue to visit for sure"}
{"text":"boyfriend and mines most favorite place to get tacos.  fast and cheap and delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Ole! I really like this place, and eating there makes me feel like I actually am in Mexico. It's very causal and has a limited menu, but the food and drinks are great and cheap. I definitely recmmend this place for an after work beer and taco, or a quick weekend dinner. Fun chain."}
{"text":"If I could give this a zero, I would. My husband wanted a breakfast burrito and we thought \"how hard is that to screw up\". Apparently it's quite easy for this place! Super bland...and he ordered the chorizo burrito! Chorizo by nature has spice. Not here. Then he ordered a side of rice and beans and was given two orders of beans, no rice. When he asked for his rice, he was handed a container of undercooked rice that was in one big ball. Literally a waste of money and calories. Not to mention the guy taking our order was a disaster. Will not be eating at this location again!"}
{"text":"I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito. This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water. Here's where the 1 star comes in. Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired. EVERY time I've ordered the same thing, and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table. There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long. My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times. 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration. Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again. Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later, but as I finally got up the courage to complain, the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies. I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that, I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore. Good Luck guys!!"}

{"text":"Some of the most Authentic tacos in Phoenix. At least that I've tried. I'm from Las Vegas and am used to taco shops on every corner. So when I came here and have to search to find a good Taco place I'm happy that I found somewhere with quality tacos."}
{"text":"Addiction: America's Taco Shop pork, aka, pastor. 

My husband loves the carne asada (I'm not a fan of carne asada, but this is pretty good nonetheless), but let me tell you, the pork is fantastic! I get the pork taco's, burrito, whatever form I can get! 

It's very casual, inexpensive, and the staff is great! 

Parking is a wee bit of a pain, because Arcadia Farms is in the hood and they hog the street parking, but it's worth a short walk to eat here..."}
{"text":"I usually love America's Taco Shop but this location is terrible. My $8 burrito was the size of a taquito and taste bland. It taste like nothing. Usually the Carne Asada burrito is huge and incredibly flavorful. So disappointed since I live right next to it. 

Stay away. Go to the other locations, they are actually great."}
{"text":"Tried Americas taco shop today because the line at Chipotle was out the door. There was no one at the restaurant on Saturday at Noon. Ordered a carne Asada burrito and it was about the size of a banana. The ingredients weren't the issue just the lack there of. Next time I'll wait in line at Chipotle for a burrito three times the size for about the same price."}
{"text":"Carne asada you'll never forget, customer service that makes you feel like family, and ambiance that will keep you coming back every week! I really love this place for work lunches or weekend relaxation.

I really do wish they would lower their prices a little, though.  I'd visit even more often if a taco didn't cost so much."}
{"text":"I rely on ATS for both dinners out and food to grab on the way home from a busy day.  Delicious food, great beach-like atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I used to love this place so it makes me sad to write this negative review. Lately, the customer service has really fallen below acceptable standards. And to add to it, they have decided to close early almost every evening. Tonight they closed at 7 (their signage states they close at 9).  I had tried to stop by various evenings throughout the week and they were always closed by or before 8.  This place is good but not good enough to deal with this run around. In summary do not trust the hours they have posted because they close whenever they feel like it. I wouldn't bother coming for dinner. They have lost a long time customer."}
{"text":"The only complaint that I have about America's is that I can't get enough Carne Asada.  It is wonderful.  I usually stay away from the beef in Mexican restaurants (especially \"Taco Stands\") fearing dog, cat, or other animals might have been harmed in the process.  The beef is outstanding.  For $20 bucks, two people can get a taco and burrito, chips and salsa, and 3 coronitas each.  Is there are better deal in town??

If you go to America's, make sure to try the Horchata and Iced Coffee blend.  It will blow your socks off.

To top it all off the staff is very courteous and nice.  The owner will pop his head out from time to time and make sure things are going well for you, and that you are enjoying your food.

All around a great experience, and one that should not be missed."}
{"text":"Could not believe how much I loved their carne asada - their sign \"Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\" wasn't some marketing ploy. I don't know who voted or where this info was published but I don't really care, it was GOOD. Not chewy or rubbery or half burnt - flavorful and delicious. 
I got the signature Vampiro Carne Asada taco with melted cheese, guac and carmelized onion. Just one, but could have eaten two for lunch with only minor regrets (my only complaint is that pulverized lettuce heap on top - any more pulsing in the food processor and that would have been lettuce mush). My dining mates got tortas, and raved. 
As a Mexican food traditionalist, I balked at the \"Our beans do NOT contain lard!\" sign, but perhaps some more healthful diners out there (and vegetarians) would appreciate that bit of info.
I also ordered an America's Corn - or Mexican Grilled Corn, which is grilled and slathered with mayo (hey, don't knock it til you try it), sprinkled with chili powder and rolled in grated cotija cheese. It was on special that day for $1, but I was immensely unimpressed. Too bad. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Gallo Blanco's version, as that baby'll knock your socks off.
As a special treat (it was my bday after all) I picked up a Mexican coke - yummy out of a glass bottle and with cane sugar instead of chemical crap. We enjoyed the picnic-style patio seating (a little loud with 7th St just feets away) but otherwise a nice spot. Will def come back for a HH, which is $2 Mexican beers (Corona, Dos XX, Tecate, Pacifico) and I want to say $1 tacos but don't hold me to that. 
I have to admit I am a fool for writing them off for a year due to their uninspired name and Dos Gringos-esque branding and atmosphere. But don't make my mistake; this place was fantastic."}
{"text":"I know they just opened but the food is disgusting. The service is super slow and the staff is extremely rude. I would NEVER spend another dollar or step foot in that place. It sucks because they are right next to the building I work at. STAY AWAY! Its not worth your money or time. Food is crazy over priced and its not even worth it. If I could have given a negative star I would have. Good luck Americas Taco Shop."}
{"text":"I ate lunch frequently at America's Tacos on 7th Ave, by my old office, so I was thrilled to see an American's open in my Downtown Scottsdale 'hood. 

I cannot not overeat at this place.  I [over]order the same items pretty much every time: a cuatro for the table - salsa, guacamole, and bean dips with chips - and a regular carne asada burrito.  If you haven't experienced cotija cheese and lime on corn on the cob before, open your mind and mouth to America's Corn.  MAN I love that stuff.  I love their salsa and guacamole.  And the carne asada....Mmm.  Sometimes I wish my burrito was bit warmer in terms of the temperature, but otherwise it's awesome. 

America's Scottsdale features a large back patio shaded by mature trees.  I've only been to the Scottsdale location in the evening.  At that hour I never have a problem with parking and the restaurant has never been crowded, inside or out.

The service is always extremely friendly and helpful.  

I couldn't ask for a better neighborhood taco shop!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see some yelpers hate this place and are not fooled by the hype.  I would like to write a review about the food but unfortunately I was never able to taste it.  Prior to the grand opening my wife and I stopped by several times misled by the signage.  Maybe \"open\" means cerrado in spanish  I don't know what the problem was.  After the real opening, we tried again, but it must have been a minor holiday and they were closed again.  My wife begged me again one night a good while after they really opened their doors and I said \"no way, they are closed\"  she insisted they were open so we went again.  I was surprised to see the festivities inside as we approached the door and couldn't wait to go inside.  Finally I was going to get to taste the most delicious silver dollar taco in Phoenix.  I kid you not, we were stopped at the door by a waitress \"no entrada\"  I laughed thinking it was a drunk girl screwing with me.  No, it was no joke, this gringo was being denied entry.  To complete my  own personal Jim Crow experience, I was told that I would be allowed to stay on the porch and eat in the cold.    \"Sorry, private party\".   There are so many good Mexican restaurants in this town, El Guerro Tortas, Regios, Pro's Ranch Market, Tradiciones,  Los Betos, Eribertos, Gallo Blanco....  There is no reason to set foot in America's Taco Shop, the place survives on hype alone, I hope they go under like all the other unfortunate casualties on 7th Street like Lisa G's, Cafe La Bella, Trente Cinq.  It's sad to see all three of them go. Honestly, if you want very good hard tacos go to Regios (1705 East Indian School) on the south side right where 51 intersects.  

I'm guessing the honkies feel comfortable at America's because it's not too ethnic and it has a cute story behind the name.  Lastly, I have to question yelpers who give such a high rating for a well executed bean and cheese burrito.

UPDATE
I incorrectly stated that I had never tasted the food. After some jogging of the memory, I recall that my wife brought take-out from America's home after work one night and I remember her opening the foil to reveal the smallest saddest driest street tacos I had ever seen.  The corn on the cob was delicious, though it was little consolation.  I think I had to go back out to pick up something substantial for dinner.  What a waste of time money and gas."}
{"text":"Excellent carne asada tacos and burritos! 

Simple and very, very good."}
{"text":"This was our second time here. The fist visit was great, and we even met America herself, who was super friendly. We went back tonight, and the girl working the front was not friendly at all - seemed irritated, and didn't even greet us when we walked in. We were there 30 minutes before they closed, and she was sitting at a table with what appeared to be her boyfriend, so I felt like we were inconveniencing her. We will go back as the food was good, but was not happy with the service we rcvd today."}
{"text":"Just a stone's throw from the Heard Museum where members of our hungry staff have turned me on to this friendly place with great food. I know ill be back! The home made tortillas are super yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. I've gone to this place twice and it was amazing both times. Prices are very affordable. Service is friendly. The carne asada is great. I can only say great things about both the food and the service. I always passed by it but I never went in to try it because it looked more like a house, but I decided to try it after my friends highly recommended it to me. I'm glad they did. I love this place.

The only con is parking. I walk, because I'm close, but I had friends who said there wasn't anywhere to park other than spots on the street that will tow your car. Apparently parking is kind of a pain, so if you're walking distance, like me, it's more convenient to walk."}
{"text":"I am from San Diego, CA, the nearby border city to TJ, Mexico. With that said, I have high standards when it comes to Mexican food. In fact, one of the most irritating things about relocating from San Diego to Scottsdale was the lack of a bomb taco shop on every corner here... Super Buririto and Fiesta Burrito you are not doing it for me!! 

But America's Taco Shop does not disappoint! While I usually am a chicken chic, I cannot believe their El Pastor taco.. With pineapple slices.. yes pineapple in your taco with pork, salsas and much more! Their margaritas for just $5 taste good.

And I think the hidden secret is the America's Corn (do yourself a favor and order this in addition), but here's a tip, have them cut it off the cob for you so that you don't have to worry about getting corn in your teeth or on your neighbor... Ew. 

Oh man! America's Taco Shop is one of my favs!!"}
{"text":"After searching for a parking spot for 10 minutes, we arrived to order carne asada tacos that were priced at $2.49 a piece. When they arrived at our table, the tacos were incomprehensibly small, heavily over-salted, extremely dried out, and simply unsatisfying. The other person who I went with ordered the carne asada quesadilla and shared the same sentiment. Bottom line: if you want to overpay for sub-par, pseudo Mexican food and only get a fraction of a serving, visit this taco shop. If not, find another place that will give you higher quality for your dollar."}
{"text":"Long wait for food that's just ok.
45 min lunch for a burrito I ate on site.
Not once did the ladies working stop by my table to see if I had my food or needed anything, I had to search them out for my order.

Once it did arrive my food was just OK although my taste buds were likely bitter because of my wait.

word."}
{"text":"Great specials.  The food is light and is not greasy at all.  Taste very fresh.  Would visit again"}
{"text":"So many great things about America's Taco Shop.  It has become one of our favorite places in the valley.  Good food, cheap beer, great patio. 

The carne asada is really great.  All their ingredients taste fresh.  It is one of the best places in Phoenix for cheap, easy eats.  Go grab a carne asada now!"}
{"text":"Best Al pastor! I'd give this place a 5 but there are SO MANY Mexican food establishments around, I will wait to see who it the real 5 ;) I have always had good food with good prices and service here!"}
{"text":"i went here about a month ago and i may or may not try it again. i ordered the quesadilla expecting all the veggies that it stated in the menu, however it was just cheese in an oily tortilla. the salsa and guacamole are divine, but a little pricey for the amount you're given. my meat eating friends loved their carne asada, so if that's what you're looking for then you may just fall in love with america's."}
{"text":"Dear A.T.S.

I am one of your customers. So much in fact that your employees know my name. And so it is with love that I share these things with you:
 
* Your food is good but overpriced...there I said it. Times are hard, we know your making a bundle, why should a burrito and coke cost me $10?
* Your margaritas suck...too sweet and carbonated!
* Your happy hour tacos are puny
* Quit advertising 'al pastor' anything...btw they gave me the runs (true story).
* This white girl loves Mana but you guys are over doing it...spice up your music selection!

All in all decent place but feel like your being cheap on us. That's a quick way to lose business.

Yours truly"}
{"text":"I have been there twice now, and have had not only great service, but the food is outstanding!  Love the tacos and the ceviche.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking to try something new and wants quality food, great customer service and it won't break the bank either!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for small chain Mexican food. (They are in about 3 states but not California)
The prices are reasonable. I ordered take out for 12 people and it was about $90.
The chicken burritos were pretty good and the guacamole was very good also but the side order was not too big so you need to get a couple large orders. 

The yellow salsa is spectacular! I do not know what it is made of but it is very tasty.

If you like hot, HOT, then order some grilled jalapeños and take bite out of them, whoa, probably better to chop them up and add them to the food but, careful they are seriously hot, at least the batch that we got

Clean place and good service also"}
{"text":"Do not order online. They forgot a part of our order, so I call and let them know, then she says, and I quote, \"Did no one tell you we're out of guacamole?\" And I say, \"No, shouldn't you have refunded the money if you knew you didn't have it?\" So I drive all the way back to the store, and she shouts that they are closed upon me walking in the door. I explain I'm there for the refund. She hands me about $6 and I said, \"It was $8\" and she says, \"oh I just refunded the chips and guacamole because you got the chips and salsa\". I then explain we did not get it - plus, I had to drive all the way back....even if I did get it, what terrible customer service to try to save a couple bucks and still try to charge me? Especially when Yelp runs a free chips and salsa ad? She didn't even offer me anything - not even a \"sorry\". I tried to contact the main headquarters to complain, but they don't have an answering machine, and they don't have an email address either. I gave it two stars because I have never had an issue with them before this. We don't go here often because it's already overpriced, but with terrible service, I can't justify going here again."}
{"text":"I know three stars doesn't sound so great but I really have no complaints about America's Taco Shop. I thought the prices were okay for mini soft tacos at $2.35 a piece, and certainly my order of 2 carne asado tacos and 2 tacos al pastor were filling. I ordered both \"America's Way\" which meant adding grilled diced jalapenos, and appreciated being able to order online and pick up my takeaway order just 20 minutes later. I guess I wish I'd been able to have other selections from the shop, perhaps dining in the really charming dining room, to really get the full experience. All in all the experience was A-OK."}
{"text":"My go-to quick burrito stop, America's is great. Their refried beans are vegetarian (sometimes hard to find) and a basic bean and cheese burrito is my old faithful. The staff is very friendly and you can't go wrong with the pricing. Cheap, fast and delish."}
{"text":"This place is okay. I think it can be over priced for what you get. For this place being a taco shop it's bland."}
{"text":"My daughter and I are here for lunch. We're not impressed. I got a salad, she got a burrito. The sizes are very small for the price compared to other places. The meat on my salad was overcooked and charcoal-ish. Daughter asked for sour cream, but they \"don't serve that here\". No crunchy tacos either. They also served her the burrito about 5 minutes before I got my salad, even though we ordered together.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, atmosphere and great prices are a few of the things I love about this place.  I also love going to eat here because the food is the right proportion combined with tantalizing flavor that leaves me satisfied and not over stuffed!  A must for your mouth!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at this place.  Love the food; had the Al Pastor Taco & Bean & Cheese Burrito for 5 bucks; it filled me up.  But, the reason I went was a review in New Times talking about America's corn; I got the last one of the night....YAY - it was wonderful!!!  It wasn't grilled like Gallo Blanco; but it was great!!!  Will definately be back!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to reduce my original review by one star. America's Taco Shop is pretty pricey. I realized that today when my quesadilla and Mexican coke came to over eight dollars..."}
{"text":"This place does a great job on tacos and their drinks.  I've been here multiple times and never been disappointed.  The staff have always  been very courteous and personable.the food has always been on point also."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... I'm glad I found this hole in the wall restaurant and hole in the wall it is, but boy is the food good here. I gotta bean cheese burrito for only 4 bucks and it was super delicious. Hot sauce was great as well. So far I like this place and the location too. I'll be back I promise senorita Bonita."}
{"text":"a few of my co-works went there and stated they were not impressed with this place.  The price you pay for the amount food is not good.  Also 2 of my co-works went there and ended up sick. They had the same food.  Also one of the guys his salsa was placed in a dirty container, it had qaucamole in it..."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because is very close to where I live. I ordered a burrito and I got a mini burrito. I thinks is overpriced for the size. The pastor was good. I may comeback for their special on Tuesday to give it a try on the tacos"}
{"text":"Service service service!!!!!! This place is ridiculous!!!!! I went to the one in the baseball stadium and it was great service and food! I just want to tell everyone that this place has the worst service in the valley!!! Not joking!!!! I was trying to order my food. I knew exactly what I wanted. I was ordering food for my whole office around 30 people. I got up to the front and the lady said \" hey if your not ready go to the end of the line; I will help the next person in line. Sir you aren't ready!!! Go to the end of the line sir!!!\" I was like wow. I said \"my whole order is written down. I'm ready\" she repeated \" sir I'm already helping the next person go to the end of the line.\" I couldn't believe what happen so I left and gave my business to jimmy johns. I ordered catering and spent 150$ next store. Just wanted to let everyone know. This place really made me mad."}
{"text":"Personally love the food however it take forever! I will generally call in my orders early and even when I get their I have to wait another 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"They get beans and tortillas right, and that's my benchmark for good Mexican fare. From there, we move to the carne asada tacos, which are excellent. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a quick lunch to go. They have a very small menu, but it still took me a while to decided between the torta and burrito. Since I haven't had a torta since I was about 12 when I was visiting Mexico City, I ordered a carne asada torta and an horchata to drink. 

Service was friendly and pretty quick. The carne asada was delicious! Finally a place that serves carne asada like I grew up with. The horchata was a little too sweet, but still good. My dad still makes the best.  :)  The torta was a pretty good size, but I think it's a little expensive for lunch and a drink to go. 

It's a pretty small place with an open kitchen and seating inside and outside under a covered patio. I would stop by again if I was in the area and craving a quick meal."}
{"text":"Word on the street is that Americas Taco Shop has THE BEST tacos. I can't say I agree but I don't whole heatedly disagree either. I went with my husband and my carne asada burrito was good, as was the corn. I saw their happy hour menu all too late but it had some decent options on it. I'll go back, I'll try something new. Maybe not the best tacos but they certainly aren't bad tacos."}
{"text":"When I walked in the girl behind the counter looked at me but didn't acknowledge me for a couple minutes. She was helping someone but she didn't say anything to me. And, the carne asada was half it's normal size! Step it up ATS or I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special here. Average tacos and below average service. If you are drunk and hungry this place might suite you."}
{"text":"Awesome and delicious food.  A definite must if you're in the area.  Only downside is that the portions are smaller and chips/salsa are extra.  Located in the hip & cool Melrose District.  Dogs are welcome on the patio."}
{"text":"I know that America's Taco Shop is known for its carne asada but I love their bean and cheese burro. I also enjoy their salsa. I agree that the size of the burro isn't as big as the 'hole' in the wall around the corner from my house but the food is great."}
{"text":"Great food made fresh. Staff were friendly. Make sure you try the al pastor Terry's Way. Great spot for Taco Tuesday and lunch."}
{"text":"A Sunday night joke. We ordered 2 chicken bowls and a cheese quesadilla to go at 6:09 pm, by 6:25 I started wondering what was taking so long. A family of 5 ordered their food, sat and ate while we were STILL waiting. Another guy ordered a bowl to eat in as well and he got his food before us. At 6:35 I finally asked where our food was- she said it would be 2 mins and that they had to make more chicken.  I work in a very strong customer service industry so I explained communicating to me that there was a wait would have been so much easier than me being upset. I could have ate at so many places tonight and chose to eat here for the first time with HIGH disappointment. I asked if there was a manager- they said no he had just left, no business card and that I could come back in the morning.

Now, I'm home and I open my food. Our cheese quesadilla is a chicken quesadilla and our bowls have hardly any chicken and IT'S COLD. Who's fooling who here? I will never eat at this establishment again and I intend to hear back from the \"manager.\""}
{"text":"Based on a recommendation from a friend, I opted to try America's Taco Shop for a solo dinner one night.  I was craving a breakfast burrito, and I was intrigued by their Ranchero burrito.

First: the restaurant was surprisingly spacious and extremely clean.  I especially liked that there was ample outdoor seating; it's always a shame to find a restaurant that doesn't have outdoor seating to take advantage of Arizona's fabulous weather 9 months out of the year.

Ordering was simple.  It was $1.99 to add a drink, chips, and salsa to my burrito, which seemed reasonable.  I got my drink cup immediately and my chips brought directly to my table (more on those in a moment).  This restaurant has a fancy Coke machine that has eight gabillion options.  I opted for the iced tea, which was delicious.

There is a large TV in the indoor dining room that was tuned to a basketball game.  The game was a little loud, but I did sit right underneath it.  It wasn't loud enough to be obnoxious, and if I sat in a different part of the restaurant the volume would have been fine.  

Now:  the food.  The chips and salsa were extremely disappointing.  The chips were cold and unbelievably stale - like they had been made the day before and sat out on the counter overnight.  The salsa was bland with no heat.  I had to add a lot of hot sauce to the salsa to make it even remotely edible.  I wish I had just ordered the drink.

The Ranchero burrito was delicious.  The eggs were perfectly cooked, there was a lot of cheese, and the potatoes added the right amount of starch and structure.  The tortilla was warm, delicious, and obviously fresh.  I could have eaten one of the tortillas by itself.  The burrito was also stuffed with red and jalapeño peppers.  The first bites weren't particularly hot, but the heat grew as I continued to eat my burrito.  Between the peppers and the obscene amounts of hot sauce I poured over each bite, the burrito almost got too hot for me to eat - which was perfect.  I LOVE spicy foods, and this hit the spot.  (If you don't like spicy foods, you should ask for your burrito without the jalapeños - it would have been delicious that way, too).

My burrito also came with salsa, and the girl at the counter gave me a choice between spicy and regular.  Because of my love for heat, I opted for the spicy salsa.  Like the salsa that came with my chips, it was incredibly bland.  This had a bit more heat, but absolutely no flavor.  I tried it on two bites of my burrito and one bite of chips before abandoning it entirely and using just hot sauce.  Thank goodness this restaurant had hot sauce!

For reference, there are two sizes for most of the burritos ATC offers: small and large.  I opted for the small, which was more than enough food for me.  It was smaller than your average Chipotle burrito, but still unbelievably filling.

While my burrito was spot-on and satisfied my craving, I can only give this restaurant three stars.  In reality, I would give it 3.5 if I could.  The prices for their burritos are reasonable, the food is delicious, the restaurant is clean, and service was fast.  However, I cannot overlook stale chips and bland salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  It's like a bakery that has terrible buttercream icing on their cupcakes - inexcusable.  

I will happily go back for their breakfast burritos, but I'll steer clear of their salsa selections."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED this place. The guacamole, ceviche (only available on Fri & Sat.) and the el pastor tacos are my FAVORITES. I am SO sad they closed :("}
{"text":"Americas Tacos has delicious, well-made food that is consistently satisfying. They have authentic Mexican recipes with surprisingly tasty options for the health conscious. The food comes out quick, but it doesn't feel like just some food chain. The service has always been above average as well. This place is a good find for a quick bite ( let's be real, we can only eat so much Chipotle)."}
{"text":"I'm a little embarrassed to say it, but the quesadilla was so delicious that I'm thinking about eating another as I write this review. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, which was a little light on shrimp and flavor. But we also got some street tacos that were good and the chips and salsa were flavorful too."}
{"text":"Pretty darn tasty but you better like Carne Asada as it's damn near the only thing on the menu.  Yes that's an exaggeration but the menu is ridiculously limited and nothing but pork and beef.  The horchata is excellent."}
{"text":"Really great customer service! Both the front cashier gentleman and the woman who served us our food were extremely pleasant and accommodating! It's a cute comfortable environment, the restaurant is clean, and the food is great! Mostly giving stars for the customer service because you can tell they go out of their way to be friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"So, if you are the kind of person that likes suggestions, I will tell you what to order to save you the trouble of guessing... 
An extra large Carne Asada Burrito Add Cilantro. It truly is the best Carne Asada in town... it is lean, non greasy and tasty as can be! There Carne Asada tacos and bean burrito are really good too! As a pointer, the breakfast burrito was no as good, too much eggs and not enough of the good stuff and a little greasy.
A great little cozy whole in the wall that makes delicious food! 
Everyone I have suggested this to loved it!"}
{"text":"First time today for lunch.

Interior- spotless, could have eaten off the floor if I wanted to.

Service, friendly, helpful and speedy, only about 8-10 minutes to get everything.

Got a chance to talk to zack, he was a serious food guy, he was happy as can be to talk to me about the food.

I had the dip trio, seriously licked the bowls.

chips were hot and delicious (i cannot stand cold chips)

I got 3 carne asada tacos, they were delicious, this is exactly what I am used to gettingt on the street in mexico, the people complaining about the size of them probably have not had tacos in mexico. I was there 10 days ago, and these are spot on.

I also had the corn, cant remember what its called there, but it was awesome! Reminded me of drunken snacking in tijuana.

I will absolutely go back. I have been to the other location in old town and the food is not nearly as good as this one, nor is the restaurant nearly as clean.

all in all, if you want some legit tacos, Americas taco shop is a perfect spot to get in and out in a hurry."}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were ok. The chips and salsa were good. The ambiance is mediocre. It's an ok lunch spot. I might come back if I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"Damn this place is tasty! I make a point to stop in Los Algodones en route to California often just to get some street taco's and these guys have nailed it. They seem subscribe to the K.I.S.S. motto (keep it simple stupid) by just making really good carne asada and now empanadas (pork) for there taco's and burritos. Easy authentic street taco's love it.

The margaritas come in 3 flavors, I'm a fan of the standard but the hibiscus was pretty tasty as well. They have an awesome outside patio to knock down a few and have a pretty good happy hour at $4 a pop.

All the small touches make this place great from the tortillas to the gauc and salsas, its definitely my new favorite joint downtown and not a bad bike ride up to Melrose District from Palm-croft."}
{"text":"I agree with those that say the portions are small, but the carne asada is like no other!  Very tender and full of flavor.  Beachy little getaway without the beach when we're in the ASU area.  The employees have always been friendly and I enjoy their spiked drinky drinks."}
{"text":"I am a bit biased against Mexican food, as I am not a fan for greasy/cheesy food. I have had some horrendous experience with a lard-dripping chicken burrito before in a place-shall-not-be-named. But as a general preference, I like my Mexican food \"light.\"

For lunch, this place is just madly busy. I was just 5 minute late and there were 20 people between me and the rest of the party. The chicken taco I got was light -- a good thing! Friends loved the bean and cheese burrito, and the bean is white bean -- another good thing! Overall, cute place, good food."}
{"text":"Not sure why this restaurant is rated as highly as it is but I thought it was just okay. While the service was decent...the food was mediocre at best. I had the Chicken Quesadilla and the portions were definitely smaller than I thought. Not only that but the food was nothing special at all. After I was finished I decided to try a taco and while that was better, it's just not enough for me to come back to the restaurant. With so many other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix metro area I doubt that I will be back."}
{"text":"The key to this place is the meat is cooked over fire, which only a few \"taco shop\" type places in greater Phoenix bother to do, and it imparts a different flavor to the meat. For $5.95, my burrito with loaded with tasty carne asada and little else... no beans or rice fillers - just good beef, not dry or grissely, nor mushy/steamed. It contained some pico de gallo and guac, though I didn't notice any guac until the last few bites (must have loaded one end). 

The biggest negative for me is paying extra for chips and salsa, especially when the chips come from a local store (and aren't that good). Also, don't go if in a hurry - it's a popular place and a small kitchen, so it can take a short while for orders to come up. 

Overall, some might get annoyed with the parking, waits, add-ons, etc. but if you like grilled asada, they do it better than most in PHX."}
{"text":"I walk past this place every day on my way to class and finally managed to stop in and try it out. The inside of the place is tiny. Fortunately they have a lot of outside seating for everyone. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I grabbed one of the menus to take a look. To be honest, I expected there to be more on the menu. Based on the menu, you can get a Taco, Burrito, Torta, Quesadilla, or Vampiro. That sounds like a decent number of choices, because in most places you get the choice of Chicken, Pork a few different ways, beef (shredded, ground, or carne asada), fish, etc. Here, the only choices listed were Carne Asada and Pastor (a marinated pork). I thought the Pastor sounded good, but was disappointed that those are the only choices.

The other thing that struck me is that the descriptions on the menu are not that accurate. The quesadilla and the vampiro have the SAME description, except that one lists flour tortilla and one lists corn tortilla. So, I ordered the vampiro because of the corn tortilla and because the price was a dollar less. When I got it, i found out that it is not at all like a quesadilla, and is in fact a lot like a tostada, not something that I had hoped for. It was open face and the tortilla was fried crisp. Also, IT WAS TINY. The vampiro was almost $4.00, it was much smaller than a standard tostada, and it wasn't loaded with the meat and toppings. The food didn't taste bad, but I wasn't thrilled with it, either.

All-in-all, I'm not sure ill be back. For that price and size, the food should be better. If the size goes up, price goes down, or the taste improves, then I'll probably come back. Until then, though, my go-to mexican place is Carolina's."}
{"text":"Man, these bean burritos are so good. I've been a fan of America's since they opened their original spot which is now closed. Just went there with my wife this weekend and their service was excellent. I don't actually typically recall service being a noteable benefit of eating there, but this one visit in particular was very pleasant. Keep it up guys!

Must gets for me are: Bean Burrito, Breakfast Burrito and a Quesadilla. And a huge Fanta."}
{"text":"Went here for a last minute dinner with my husband and son. I was surpised at how similar it looked to the old baja fresh. I was expecting more of the original decor from the other locations. I ordered the grilled chicken vampiro. I wasn't sure how big it was so i asked the cashier if I should order 1 or 2. She said a lot of people just order 1 but if you're really hungry order 2. I was very hungry so I got that and a carne asada taco. At about $3.50 each I was shocked at how small they were and even more shocked that the cashier actually said one could fill me up! They were both good but not worth the price. My husband got the carne asada burrito which he thought was good and a better portion for the price. 

Over all the place seems like a more expensive knock off of baja fresh. Plus all the table were dirty."}
{"text":"I was at the Airport coming back from a trip. Mind you this is on the outside of security. 
I first went to LoLos but, no one was working it seemed.
So then I moved on to America's Taco Shop. It was fairly busy. I have heard good things about it , so I thought I would give it a try.
I ordered 2 beef Tacos and 2 Chicken Tacos. Both on soft shells. I figured I would take home dinner for the Family.
Well, One person rang it up and then another girl made the tacos. She was wearing plastic gloves while making the food, but here is the best part. WhILE MAKING THE TACOS SHE PUT A PIECE OF MEAT IN HER MOUTH.
YES, I WATCHED HER DO IT. RIGHT OUT THERE IN FRONT OF ALL. Now I know that they probably get hungry and maybe they did not get time for her to have a break.
But, please , do not eat off your hand and continue to make my food with the same gloved hand. Because, I saw it, I just could not enjoy my food at all. My girlfriend asked why didn't you just cancel your order and get your $$ back.
Yes, I should of , but I did not.   I know probably worse things happen in restaurants and Kitchens across America. But, know that is all I can think of whenever I see one of these places.  With the Measles going around at the time and all the crazy Flus it just freaked me out. Sorry, I will never be back for a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"The food ok, the atmosphere, frankly, awesome. I loved the decor, the redone retro house, patio, waitstaff... yelp, yelp, yelp. But at the end of the day, Best carne asada in Phx? Nope. The lady and I only ordered some tacos but since this was a taco shop, I figured the signature item was the best bet. Yea, I'll be back but not til after I really find the best carne asada. 5 years still looking..."}
{"text":"As the other reviewers have stated - this is NOT the same as the 7th St or 7th Ave location.

First time in was the taco trio (al Pastor, carne asada, pollo asado) , elote (America's corn) and a large cochata (iced coffee mixed with horchata.) 
The cochata was brilliant! My new favorite non alcoholic beverage. And the service was friendly. Those are the two stars.
The tacos were dull and bland. The corn was just plain sad. So many GOOD elote options in this town.  So many decent elote options. So bummed this was mediocre at best.

Second visit was the same taco trio and large cochata. The pork and beef were a little better this time, the chicken was still super lame. The salsa is decent at best.
At least the cochata still hit the spot.

That said...there are so many good taquerias in the area. Where tacos of a similar size and better quality cost notably less. I don't see any reason to make it back to this sad little America's franchise."}
{"text":"I had the extra large carne asada burrito, and truthfully, I was not impressed.  The burrito was about half the size of chipotle's buritos.  Howeverf if you want really good mexican food, go to guadalahara south of teh the ball park on 7th st."}
{"text":"Always so polite and fast  I love  coming  here to eat and the music is great too not to loud and a wide variety"}
{"text":"So happy this America's Taco Shop moved right next to my office! I've been here twice since it opened and each time and had a great experience. My favorite taco is the Carne Asada and the Chicken one is okay. I did not like the Al Pastor because I thought the pineapple and pork were too sweet together but my husband loved it.

The restaurant offers plenty of seating, quick service, and a new Coke machine so you can get over a 100 different types of soda. But why get soda when you can get some freshly made HORCHATA! It's thick and sweet and cinnamony and I love it. One friend who never had it before said it tasted like egg nog and another said it tasted like a milk shake. Either way, I'll be getting a large horchata every single time  I come here. :D"}
{"text":"I know it is your first week open but the speed and efficiency leaves a lot to be desired. Get it together and I will come back. Having to wait 20 minutes for a to go order when I was the only one waiting for food is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Yay! I am so happy America's Taco Shop has finally opened in Old Town! There are no good Mexican spots nearby, so this is really a treat. This is an order at the counter style restaurant, so it's nothing fancy, but they have a great patio and solid food.  Their guacamole is made fresh, and the Vegetarian bean and cheese burrito is excellent. Did I mention they have some of the best tortillas around? Oh, and the patio appears to be dog friendly too!!"}
{"text":"It's still good. I used to live right behind this place when it first opened up. It was my favorite and I would get it every other day. I was back in town for the first time in 5 years and wanted to go back to Americas and see. It was alright. The pastor was not as great as I had remembered. A little on the drier side this time, and no piña. I was a little bummed. Still good though, just not as great as I remember."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and i went here for a quick dinner, as I was taking off from the airport and we wanted to eat.  My review is based more on the food, than the service.  The customer service was good, they were a little quiet, but polite and courteous.  The food, in my opinion, could have been a little better prepared.

My girlfriend had chicken tacos and I had tacos Al Pastor, both were serviced with beans.  A side of chips also came with the orders.  My Girlfriend said her tacos's were good.  My Taco's Al Pastor seemed more of a breaded fry than a Al Pastor marinade.  They were very tough.

The beans were unusually white and creamy.  Not sure if they were instant or maybe to much oil/lard in the mix?

The salsa's weren't bad.

We also ordered two medium Horchata drinks.  Both drinks were very chalky, way to chalky to be refreshing like other establishments I have tasted.

My overall opinion, airport food isn't cheap by any means, therefore the eateries should be working harder to make each order wonderful.  As a side note, by the time my plane got to it's destination both my girlfriend and I had real bad stomach aches..."}
{"text":"Where there's smoke there's fire.  The smoke in this case is the all-to-common reviews of ATS.  This place is constantly mentioned in Phoenix magazine as the best carna asada in Phoenix.  It's not.  Not even close.  As nearly every other reviewer mentioned, the portion-to-cost size (i.e. value) is very disheartening.  Even my waifish (110 lb) wife had to go back for two more tacos.  The tacos are good, not great.  They're not double tortilla wrapped like most taco shops.  The salsa is ok.  I had the burrito al pastor, regular size but it was pretty tiny for $5.95.  Didn't come with any chips or salsa.  The flavor was ok but if you're really looking for great tacos in Phoenix, go to Tacos Atyoac.  Carambas has nearly identical carna asada.  I had the mexican corn but they were out of cojita cheese (?) so it wasn't the same.  It was my choice to still get it but I shouldn't have.  How can you be out of cojita cheese if you're a mexican restaurant?  Grab a $20 from the till and go south to Food City-you'll be back in less than 15 minutes.

This used to be a pretty cool Phoenix sucess story but it looks like the food is now secondary to building a chain.  ATS, please read the reviews and make the corrections needed before its too late. While I wouldn't take points off for service, the help was less than inviting."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times when I've been in the neighborhood. Food is terrific, love the corn rolled in cheese. Tacos are generous and tasty. Grab a cold Mexican coke and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food. Overpriced. I got the Carne Asada Torta. Not horrible but NOT good. If you want a delicious amazing Torta... Go to Los Reyes De La Torta. It's 7 miles North of this place."}
{"text":"Went there today and was extremely disappointed. I had raved to friends about the one on 7th street.  Carne asada burrito was dry with no taste.  The salsa that came with the chips was entirely tomato sauce with zero taste. Friends were not happy and neither was I for recommending it."}
{"text":"Real great authentic Mexican food. I had the chorizo breakfast burrito and it was delicious. The chorizo was lean and not greasy at all. The mashed beans were amazing. They even have al pastor with a pineapple on top just rotating like rotisserie. Definitely going to be a regular here and the prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"Walked by this place for years, usually not too busy.  Decided to try today and I must say the worst tacos ever.  The white corn tortillas were soggy.  The meat tough and grizzly and without flavor.  Since it is called The Taco Shop, the tacos should be the thing to order.  I will not go back."}

{"text":"I used to work right next to here and would stop in for lunch once a week or so. The service is okay, not the best but not the worst. The food is pretty good. I normally get the breakfast burrito, because I'm a sucker for breakfast food."}
{"text":"Been here twice near closing time. Both times they were out of Carne Asada so I didn't get tacos. Tried the ceviche the second time they were out of carne and it practically came in a Dixie cup! Literally...it was probably 4 bites of ceviche for a ridiculous price. I miss the Baja Fresh that was here before this joke moved in. One star !!"}
{"text":"Took the place of Baja Fresh all over the valley.  Really to bad.  The food we got during a non-busy time was cold and delivered at distinctly different times.  Food was at best presentable but the taste was unappealing.  The service was Ok to good but it cannot make up for average to poor food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very good.  I was surprised but how tasty the food is and how much the flavors compare to those in Mexico.  The prices are extremely good. My kids love to go there.  The staff is friendly and great.  All in all, I really think its restaurant deserves a try.  I love it!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once.  The service was very pleasent and the food was delivered fast.  There were only a few customers which can make for long waits sometimes.

I particularly liked the vegetarian quesadilla.  Making it with Jack cheese and fried onions.  Very different and quite tasty."}
{"text":"Had their tacos and a margarita. Was dissapointed with the marg, the tacos were decent. Prices seemed a bit steep for the tacos, they were small but the price was big. All in all, I wouldn't specifically avoid this place, but I also wouldn't go out of my way to come here. There are better tacos down the street at Gallo Blanco."}

{"text":"Soda machine was awesome (one of those new ones where there are a ga-zillion flavor options; I mean where else do you find diet fanta orange?) and so was the food.  

If you're looking for good portions (ie: Chipotle) this isn't your place.  You pay more for less food than Chipotle.  

However, if you're looking for good food (esp carne asada) this place is great for that.  

They have combo options and deals that we noticed AFTER sitting down (they weren't obvious and we weren't up-sold by the cashiers).  I think if they promoted the combos where you get a burrito, chips and salsa and a drink--then they'd do better.  Otherwise, ordering a la carte makes it seem like you aren't getting that much food for the price."}
{"text":"ALL I GOT TO SAY IS :: PERUVIAN BEANS
The staff is helpful and gracious, plus they honor yelp promotions like the one where you get a free boat of chips upon your first check in (shwweeet). Their decor is cute, they have a patio, good salsa, AND they serve booze for a good price. Holler"}
{"text":"Americas Taco Shop is a little nieghborhood hangout. I ordered two carne asada tocos, chips and salsa (yes, you have to buy chips and salsa!), and a Jamaica drink. I got the last chips in the bag!, two tacos with the left over carne asada from the day before, and a Jamaica drink that was way to strong. This must have been a bad day for America, as it was a bad meal for me!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming here to America's Taco.  It may not be perfect, but they have good service and tasty food. What more do you want?

Mind you this is not Chipotle. You won't find a dozen or so condiments or add ons to choose from - just a meat filled burrito, with a minimum of extras.  This way you can taste what you are eating. 

No big scoops of rice or beans. No assembly line of sour cream, lettuce, corn, cheeses or three types of salsa. Just a flaky flour torrita filled with some really delicious meat. Again, this way you can taste the deliciousness of their food and not hid it.

Expect to pay $10-$15, depending how thirsty or hungry you are. I'll guarantee you'll take some home for later.  They also have a Happy Hour where they serve Street Taco and more. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos are delicious. The service is good, and the place is cute. It's close to downtown and easy to get in and out of at lunch time. The prices are fair but lean towards the  high side for lunch."}

I Highly recommend this family-owned business!!"}

{"text":"Stopped in because of a free taco coupon. Very glad I did. Ambiance was updated casual. A step up from typical fast food. The cashier was friendly and personable. I ordered a chicken and steak taco without onions. The order came out with just cilantro, as requested. There were 3 salsas to choose from. Nice to have the variety as one I preferred with chicken and the other 2 were both tasty with the carne asada. I'm a huge iced tea fan. They had a very fresh tasty fruit flavored tea. I'll come back with my husband. I think he'll really like it too."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a favorite but its gone downhill a bit. We love to get the quattro with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The bean burritos are still the best in town. We are now vegetarians but when we ate mest we loved the carne asado tacos, but they changed the meat and it just isn't the same. OK with us since we don't eat them anymore. This is good fast food."}
{"text":"The tacos were cheap, filling and simple.  Nothing spectacular but will satisfy your taco fix at a great price!"}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop likes to call itself the \"Home of the Greatest Carne Asada\".  The original restaurant on 7th Street, use to include \"in the Valley\" but I guess they're thinking bigger now, which is good.

In some Mexican restaurants, ambiance is everything.  Here it's just one more thing that makes you want to come back and enjoy their fresh food!  This restaurant is hard not to like.  When you come in, you feel as if you left a beach in Mexico (see photos), or SoCal. There are hardwood floors and a surfer feel to it.

What can I say?  In America's Taco Shop, it's all about the Carne Asade!  

Whether you order the Burrito, or the Quesadillas, what you will get is a home made flour tortilla filled with flavor,  We ordered both, along with their Trio of Tortilla chips, Salsa and Guacomole, and a soft drink and a Horchata.  If you haven't tried a horchata drink, try it here.  It's a mixture of rice milk and cinnamon with a hint of vanilla, and it's out of this world.

The food came out piece meal, with the chip Trio coming first.  The salsa had a little kick to it, but it wasn't too spicy.  The guacamole was tasty and well mixed, not chunky as in some places.  Just as we were starting to make a dent, out came the rest of the food.  

The tortillas on the quesadilla and burrito were both flaky and fresh.  There was a fair amount of pico de gallo and guacomole, along with some caramelized onions that mixed well with the carne asada.  Each did not overwhelm the other and it produced  a nice layering effect.  Very tasty!

The bill came to around $22 bucks, including tax and a couple bucks for the tip jar.  As we were leaving, we noticed that they had the Mexican delicacy of corn on the cob, brushed with mayo, cotija cheese and served on a stick.  

Wow!  Horchata and fresh corn, what does that tell you about how authentic a Mexican restaurant America's Taco Shop is?

Keep in mind that ATS has a Happy Hour which runs M-F from 3-6pm and all day Saturday and Sunday -- which has many items for $1, $2, and $3, including a 16 oz. Margaita, as well as a Tres Amigos Tequila for $3.00.  You can also sign up for their eClub and get their Trio for free.

We left stuffed, with our taste buds tingling for more.  Well, until next time then.

Very impressive, watch out Chipotle!"}

{"text":"i don't understand what all the hype is about this place.  been there once and thought the food was very bland...and the bottled coke was pretty much the same price that i would pay for a margaritta at  any other place.  it shouldn't be that hard to impress me at a mexican restaurant considering i usually partake in my favorite activity while watching a cheech and chong flick before i get some grub. oh well.  i would puff puff pass this place in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Worst $18 I've ever spent... We ordered the combo #4 for two and might as well have ordered two kids meals. There was hardly anything in the burritos and the tacos were as big as my finger... Are you kidding me ? You can get better tacos and burritos from Riva's and theyre 1/4 the price"}
{"text":"I went in thinking it was going to be way better then Taco Bell but im afraid I was wrong! I ordered a quesadilla and it was small and not worth the 6 bucks I paid for it I also got a chicken taco and it was DISGUSTING. Dry and no flavor at all. I asked for sour cream and they said they didn't serve it. They are seriously over priced for what they serve!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a taco, quesadilla, and margarita.  The cashier said we're out of margaritas until Monday.  Unfortunately, she didn't think it was that big of a deal.  I decided to leave, based on her response.  Rating is not reflective of the food, because I've eaten at another location and it was good that time.  Unfortunately, I was just very disappointed with the service at this location."}
{"text":"It seems interesting to me that this place has gotten some really good reviews.  I guess neither I nor my husband \"get it.\"  My husband and I visited this place shortly after it opened.  So, maybe it had made some changes?

We had the carnita's burrito.  In my opinion, it was not that great and totally overpriced for what you get.  The carnitas was dry and there was an odd sweetness, perhaps a sweet salsa, in the filling.  I am a salty, savory, spicy person.  I don't like my burritos to be sweet.  

I don't think I would visit this place again.  I am just not into it.

For some reason it is difficult to find a good Mexican restaurant in Tempe.  I really don't understand why.  

My go to is Restaurant Mexico or Chipotle for something quick and cheap in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"A must is the Carne Asada torta. The taco trio is also delicious.  We also had the chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"Overpriced food and tiny portions.  The food is good but can't compare to authentic street tacos we get in Rocky Point or Baja."}
{"text":"Located on the outskirts of Old Town but definitely accessible without a car. Order your food at the counter. The server will bring your order to the table. Tacos are $2.5 bones. Traditional Mexican Food, beer, and Margaritas. There is a decent patio seating area in the back. Free chips and with good salsa. Service is friendly and fast. Food is definitely worth the short walk!"}
{"text":"On the way home from work yesterday, a friend wanted to meet up at America's Taco Shop for a snack & catch up conversation and chisme -- You know me, I'm all about good tacos & chisme! 

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito -- delicious & full of flavors. Somethin' about the recipe they use for the carne asada alone makes it special. I look forward to returning -- now that it's cooler, outdoor seating will be ideal. Cheers***"}
{"text":"Decent eats.  Chipotle and Baja Fresh are just better.  Place was clean but the food was average. Nothing stood out.  If I had a choice between Chipotle , Baja Fresh or American Taco Shop...I'll pick Baja then Chipotle ....
Still worth a trip if u are craving quick Mexican food"}
{"text":"Ahhhhmazing. I'm hooked and love it. Awesome beans. Great prices. Great margarita. Wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I got there and I'm just the one customer that god a bad batch of something but this place is garbage, I've gotten better food for a better price at filibertos.

Okay I'm sorry let me explain why I changed it from one to two. The girl working the counter was attentive and nice but the food wasn't good, the only reason I ate it was I was hungry and a paid for it. The pastor had no flavor, and the flavor that was there was smothered with baby food consistency blender smooth bean paste that they loaded into my burrito, along with 2 pathetic pieces of pineapple and a plastic spoon full of gaucomole at the ass end of my burrito."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Americas today and had the special....a bean and cheese burito and a taco.  We both like the food but found it not exceptional and while good, we went away still hungry"}
{"text":"This taco shop is definitely worth a stop. We tried they carne tacos a bean and cheese burrito and the Mexican corn ....was like dessert.  Would have given 4 stars but ice tea was no good."}
{"text":"Soft, warm tortilla with a delicious filling! Ordered the carne asada burrito (about $6) as recommended by someone who works here. It definitely did not disappoint! Tender, juicy carne asada, carmelized, sweet onions, fresh pics de gallo, and guac! my fiancé ordered the classic bean and cheese burrito ($4) and a carne asada taco. Both very good as well! Burrito had the same soft flour tortilla and the refried beans (pintos) weren't super thick or super chunky. Cheese was melted and burrito came out HoT! Something else I can appreciate is that the beans aren't made with lard and you can tell by the taste. I wish we weren't just passing by and this was in Cali bc I would be a regular for sure!!! Thanks for a great affordable burrito in Arizona!!!"}
{"text":"I am not sure why it took me so long to try this place when it is only a couple of blocks from home, but I am glad I finally did. Based on my experiences (3-4 times a month), the food has been fresh, the store very clean and the service fast and friendly.  The chorizo breakfast burrito is my favorite with the carne asada taco a very close second. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the items though."}
{"text":"As a regular at the original Americas's Taco Shops on 7th ave and 7th St. I was excited about this location opening up in my neighborhood. However, I was really disappointed. 

First the menu is really confusing, unlike the original they have different sizes of chips and salsa...really??? 

The chips were also very stale and cold, along with the carne asada vampiro that had very little carne asada. 

Do yourself a favor and stick to the original locations!!! Either go to the one on 7 th street or 7th ave it worth the drive...Do NOT GO TO THIS location it was really bad!!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for months but was reluctant because I hate dealing with the crowds and parking around ASU.  However, my wife and I decided to give it a shot Saturday afternoon.  For some reason there were no crowds and parking was a breeze.

The place is nice, quaint and clean.  Not like your typical taco shop or your local Filibertos.  Well I'm not saying that Fili's isn't awesome because it is, but ATS is just a tad bit different.  We sat outside which was great because the weather was beautiful.  It really was the perfect lazy Saturday afternoon lunch.

The food:

Guacamole - this was very fresh and good.  I like it a bit more spicy but it was still very good and I would order it again.  The chips were very good as well.

Shrimp Cheviche - I thought this was just ok.  Civiche really isn't my thing but my wife loves the stuff.

Pastor Vampiro - This was excellent.  I had never heard of a vampiro before so I had to try it.  The thing was loaded with good stuff and the meat was excellent.

Taco - My wife ordered a taco (I forget which meat was in it) and it was excellent.

America's Corn - This was my favorite part of my meal.  It was sooooo good.  Needed a sprinkle of chili powder though....

Anyway, everything was very very good.  All I have to say is that it is way over priced.  Like $2.25 for a real small taco is ridiculous in my opinion but I still think the place is pretty solid.  The service was fast, friendly and courteous and I will definitely be back hopefully soon.  Oh, and I liked their selection of hot sauces on the tables."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food I had from America's Taco Shop North last night. The Burro de Pastor rotisserie pork was wonderful, though I could have done without the pineapple. The salsa that came with the chips was GREAT! The guacamole was fresh and amazing. The bean and cheese burrito was highlighted by a buttery soft flour tortilla. I will definitely be frequenting this shop. They've done a great job with lifting the curse of that particular corner."}
{"text":"Let's go with 5 stars. Good food good service the tortas are super bomb chips and a drink only another $1.99 also"}
{"text":"Nice that you can sit outside.  Cashier wasn't that friendly but the cook was.  Tamarindo is the best I have ever had.  Corn was good.  Carne Asada tacos just okay.  Quite pricey for what you get.  I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"If I did loved this place .... so easy going, different for everything I had have.... a must go in San Diego.... so good"}
{"text":"And they cater parties. That is how I was introduced to Americas Taco Shop and I love it."}
{"text":"I have no Idea how this place has 3 stars..   I paid $10 for 3 tiny little tacos that tasted like cardboard...I guess I should've known that \"Americas\" taco shop would be a lie and a rip-off."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's the best Carne Asada in town.  But it's darn tasty... flank steak assertively marinated and grilled, with a nice char on the outside.  The char sets good carne asada apart from the rest.  Loved the agua fresca offerings.... I got the jamaica and dining partner ordered tamarindo.  both tangy and refreshing.  however we take major points off for the chips/salsa.  it's a side dish for $1.50, with a fairly good sized basket of chips but a tiny little dribble of salsa.  we got more for another $1.50 and still felt ripped off.  I mean c'mon, kids, you can make gallons of the stuff for a small amount of dinero, you're shamelessly overcharging for it.  We will probably go back to try the Vampiro and the Pastor, but I'd gladly give more than 3 stars if you weren't so parsimonious with salsa, a Mexican restaurant staple."}
{"text":"Carne asada and Cochata are both solid tasting. My only complaint is that 1 burrito (regular, not XL), and 1 taco run $10, then a drink on top of that and you go up from there.  Friendly staff. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Without question, the worse Quesadilla I've had in my 35 years of life, and I've lived in Mexico for a total of about a year, so eaten countless quesadillas.  They put like shredded lettuce in it.  It is gross"}
{"text":"Work has taken me downtown a few times over the past couple months and America's Taco Shop has been one of our regular lunch stops.  My favorite is the XL Carne Asada Burrito (probably because it's normally a late lunch and I am starving).  The parking situation sucks being so small and packed even well into the afternoon.  Probably better that we don't arrive during the lunch rush..."}
{"text":"I feel right in the middle about America's Taco Shop. It's not my favorite but I don't hate it either. I do enjoy their lunch specials, it is a good price for a meal, chips and a drink. It is in a good location for me and it a good option for lunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"I happened to come here when it wasn't busy and I enjoyed it very much! I ended up getting a breakfast burrito with steak instead of chorizo and a roasted jalapeno. For my morning beverage pairing, I went with a cochata. The burrito was very good. I really liked the steak better than the chorizo in it and the beans were excellent; also, the jalapeno was super fresh! I really appreciate a fresh pepper like that. What really got me though was the cochata. It's pretty simple, coffee and horchata, but I had never had it before. The flavors go together very well, and if you like sweet coffee drinks, you should love this! I can't wait for the weather to get cool again because the patio looked awfully cozy and would be a great place to enjoy a cerveza."}
{"text":"The service was great, the workers are friendly and the food was really good. It's a great place to go if you're not in the mood for a sit down expensive lunch. The food has no fillers which is amazing, it is great to have a healthier taco option. The guacamole was amazing and fresh, the tacos were delicious as well as the burritos and cheese crisp. They were happy to customize the order for the kids as well."}
{"text":"Got the chicken burrito and girlie got a torta. Torta was good burrito was so small that I had to order a taco. When they say America's taco shop they mean that it's a redneck taco shop.

Quantity sucks, it's not authentic at all, and comes with a huge price lol.... 

Never coming here again. 

The service was nice"}
{"text":"I've gone to various America's Taco Shop locations before and have never been that impressed. I'd say the same for this experience. 

1st things, we ordered this for a school lunch meeting the other day. We put in the order the night before but no one ever saw it. It was packaged in a hurry and very difficult to distribute. We certainly wold not order it for a group event again. 

That being said I went back today because I was craving tacos and could bike there in between classes. I was happy to see they gave me napkins in my to go order but that was about the only good thing.  The tacos were meh, as I had expected, but the worst things was this entire place smelled like a bathroom. So if you think America is a bathroom I guess the title is for you. I personally love America and do not care for this place. 

I'd take a pass."}
{"text":"Great taco shop!  I love the al pastor \"anything!\"  This is the only taco joint I've found real al pastor in the valley.  The only other time I've had al pastor is in Playa del Carmen, MX.  Thanks for bring one of my favorite dishes to the the valley."}
{"text":"I really like this place and try to eat there when I can.  It's Mexican food that is not drenched in cheese.  They also have Mexican Coke, which is the perfect drink with the tacos or the Al Pastor.  The flavors are delicious.

I recommend it to you.  Have also eaten the one on 7th Street and it's good."}
{"text":"This is one of our most favorite place for my husband and I to meet for a lunch date!! It's a convenient location for both of us.  But that isn't the only reason we like this place.  The street Tacos are awesome - particularly the Al Pastor.  The chips and salsa have always been refillable (so even if the portion size is small as another post said before, you can always get more!!). We particularly like their hot salsa - such great flavor!! 

What really sold us on this place... the customer service!! Always above average - consistently asked if we need anything, how out experience had been and everyone in there has a GREAT attitude!!  We often brig our 18 month old son and never feel bad for the mess he throws on the floor.  Every time we have started to clean up after him they stop is and finish the job, with a smile on their face!! 

We will continue to tell all our friends and family about this place!!"}
{"text":"This is a favorite in our home, great food and priced reasonable!!! Love the carne asada tacos! Large selection of Burritos-fast service, always clean inside,eating area a little small-"}
{"text":"Food great, pricing a bit high with so much competition for ghetto mex I was expecting.  Food good, ambiance nice, service GREAT!  I guess the deal is the quality is better, thus the higher price.  I personally would go back if they had a bit better pricing."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I continue to wait more than 30 minutes for a 3-item takeout order.  Lots of people around me waiting for food too.  Staff hurrying around looking confused.  This is clearly a restaurant concept with some growing pains. 

I've been going to the locations at 7th Ave. and 7th St. for years and they are wonderful, charming little restaurants with great food.  This feels like a hastily thrown together franchise, and it is diluting the America's Taco Shop name."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the #2 bean burrito & chicken taco. Love their beans. Smooth and creamy. Yummy ! 

Great atmosphere with the Mexican music in the background. Felt like a little taco shop in mexico. 

Clean restaurant  and very friendly young man with red curly hair. They have a gem with him. He was so helpful. 

This may have been my first time here but definitely not my last."}
{"text":"Not authentic mexican food as advertise, disappointed.
Burn beef, hard to bite commercial flour tortilla, nothing to be excited about, maybe the only mexican is the owner, sad."}
{"text":"Nope. 

Totally underwhelming and bland tacos. Bland and kind of weird beans (almost a fluffy texture - not what I expect from beans.) 

Decent service and a plus for having real iced tea. But those don't make up for the yuck food. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was alright but I thought it was a bit overpriced for fast food Mexican that's really nothing special or unique. Me and my wife went there and it was over $20 and I was just barely full. It's a better value to just go to a local sit down Mexican restaurant or hit up another taco shop. In one word how would I describe? \"Overrated\"

Can't believe I've read some reviews saying you get a lot of food for the money. Where do some of you eat where you walk away barely full and have spent over $20 on so so fast food and call it \"cheap\" and \"large portions\"?"}
{"text":"I love this place for what it is. Not the best food in the world but very good for the price and it compares favorably to most low/mid price level eat spots."}
{"text":"Terrible. Other locations knock it out of the park with their quality, but this place really hurts the chain's reputation. Our vampiros were served on cracked, old tortillas with brown guacamole. Our chicken tacos came on old soggy tortillas that fell apart at the first bite -- they just grossed me out, to be honest. I hope someone monitors these reviews, so they can get this straightened out. We have really loved America's Tacos at the two other Phoenix locations."}
{"text":"Me and a few coworkers decided to check the place out since it landed in the Phoenix magazine. We got there at 11:30am, which apparently is a good time because when we were getting ready to leave the line was out the door and there were no open seats. The parking lot is super tight. Seating in cramped, but you know what, I didn't mind. Menu is little, makes it easy to order!!

I got two tacos (carne asada) and corn. The tacos were great, but not out this world. The corn, however, was delicious and because it was I will be back! My coworkers got the torta and burrito and we all share nachos and salsa. The torta got rave reviews and I will be getting that next time.  The horchata, per my coworker, was the best she's ever had. Overall a good experiance."}
{"text":"I have eaten at a lot of taco shops and this is one of the worst hands down. The tacos were cold, the meat was over cooked and there was absolutely zero customer service here. The guys face might actually break if he smiled of thanked you for your business."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fast service, but if you are looking for Baja Fresh.,.......this is not it.  I had their signature combo with 3 different types of tacos and all the items were dry.  I guess the flavor is a little bland too but I did not notice it as I was trying to figure out how this place could be so crowded even when the meats are dry.  

well the salsa and chips are decent, good spicy salsa.  Otherwise for 7-8 bucks for 3 subpar tacos, no thank you.  I have had better at a lot of places and also, if your tacos are leaking and falling apart, why don't you use 2 shells ?  I mean, it can't be that much.  I had 5 dollar plates at el rancho ranch market and they serve them that way and their meat was not dry.  

Anyway, I guess the bright light, clean eating area, friendly staff makes up for subpar food for folks who want a quick lunch.  it is indeed america's taco shop if you are looking for an american taco, but heck I had better tacos at Dos Gringos and I'm pretty sure the chef was drinking too :)  Pls bring back Baja Fresh."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service was terrible. Girl was wearing a shirt that said 'Happy Camper' she was far from it. She was actually mean. I didn't make any special requests that may have put her out. They need to reconsider who their guests deal with."}
{"text":"Baam, and just like that my friends at Americas Taco Shop in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport made my day again. 

We'd 7/29 around 8 am the staff was on it as I'm use too. Great greeting, great service, and as usual awesome product. I love this place. I don't always get to leave a review on every visit but I eat here every week and if my connection allows I easy here twice a week. 

If you did not like the food here then you must have no taste buds. Simply killer flavors. 

Thank you again America as this guy is muy filez."}
{"text":"Came during rush hour on a Wednesday. There were only three other people dinning. Bathrooms were clean. Loud Latin music inside, so I sat out on the uncovered patio with umbrellas. Patio was clean, live flowers on each table. Ordered two al pastor tacos with pineapple. Delicious. Also had guacamole and chips. The guac wasn't spicy, could have used more jalapeño, also had tomatoes. The chips where salty. Yummy and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"My first time eating here. Okay tacos. Nothing to write home about. I did the three taco trio. Substituted the al Pastor for another Carna Asada. Little bit on the dry side. The red mild sauce, even a kid could eat it. Green sauce looked like it was from a can. Chicken taco tasted best.Miss the salsa bar of the Baja Fresh that used to be here. Chips were room temp. Ordered the Horchata for a drink. It tasted kind of powdery. Staff was attentive. My belly's full. Kind of wished I went with my original plan and ate somewhere else for dinner. Dinner costs about $12 and some change."}
{"text":"The portions are small and they could sure use a salsa bar.  Couldn't tell the hot and mild salsas apart, plus it seemed like they were made with canned crushed tomatoes.  No bueno. It would be nice if some chips were included with the tacos or burritos."}
{"text":"Went here with a mad hangover with a few friends earlier today. Let me just say, the food certainly hit the spot. I'd been told by some to order anything with carne asada. Boy, am I glad I did!

I got the Carne Asada quesadilla (XL, as the regular is just an 8 in tortilla folded in half). It was delicious. Caramelized onions, lettuce, tender carne asada .... it melted in my mouth. 

Also had some yummy chips and salsa. The patio seating was nice and the shade was an added bonus. I'll definitely check out this place next time in Tempe. :)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty off-beat and laid back place. There is outdoor seating only (maybe 1 or 2 two-person spots inside the very busy one-room place that it is), which has lots of bugs and birds around. I recommend getting take-out only. The staff members were helpful. The prices are quite low and this is an affordable place to get decent fast Mexican food. They also have different food and drink specials advertised daily.

The food is pretty good. I especially liked the chips and salsa. The chips were crispy and thin, while the salsa had a nice spicy flavor. I also tried a steak quesadilla. The meat had a great flavor, but the pieces were very tiny and there needs to be more. There was a little too much guacamole on it. However, the flavors were good. 

I would visit again when in a hurry and looking for an inexpensive Mexican meal."}
{"text":"Wonderfully friendly service, fantastic bean and cheese burrito, ceviche was extremely tasty.  I've switched to the 7th Street from 7th Ave locations since it's closer to home (and ate their last night and tonight).  Consistently good service and yummy food."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal.  Fast service.  Casual dining."}
{"text":"The best breakfast burritos that I've had in Tempe. Also the daily specials make it even better as there's one dollar tacos and two dollar beer. Definitely a place to try out if you live in Tempe."}
{"text":"Being from SoCal I am VERY PARTICULAR about my Al Pastor meat.  This place exceeded my expectations on taste and presentation.  
I got the Al pastor bowl (sans guac) and it was quite tasty!  Price was great @ 5.99 and portion was perfect.
For a first timer I definitely recommend them for lunch on the patio.  I may try this spot for dinner as the lighting outside, I'm sure, would be beautiful at night."}
{"text":"Street tacos took 15 minutes to prepare while no one was in the shop..said it was because of phone orders ahead of me... two people walk in and walk out while I'm waiting with small bags. That can't be what took so long, can it? 

Tacos were underwhelming. Meat was bland and dry."}
{"text":"Night  Staff very friendly as I have been here twice just before closing.   Flan $3.95  is best I have had in the valley.  Trust me, I've had many.  Corn is delicious.  Beans are creamy.  Although, Vampiro w Carne asada  $3.50 was delicious  I wish it was larger.  Get 2 as 1 will not fill you.  Horchata good but not as good as La Condesa Gourmet Taco.   Ample easy free lot parking.   Almost a 5."}
{"text":"I always  get the same thing a bean burrito chips guac and salsa. Yes I know basic but when you can make the basic always delicious that's awesome. Most employees are friendly and they are all always professional. Some don't smile much...but I'm paying for beans and guac not smiles."}
{"text":"I have only been to America's 3 times and every time I try to have something different because I always hear people rant and rave about it.  I only give it 3 stars because the food is just fair in my opinion.  I have been to other places that have better tasting carne asada and a better selection on salsas.  I think they try and put amodern twist on their tacos but sometimes simple and old fashion is better than \"fancy\" ingredients.

I will probably still go there if I need a carne asada fix and cant get to Tucson but it isnt someplace that I would take people for anything authentic."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their chicken. I love the char-grilled chicken burrito but make sure you get it America's way. A few hot sauces to choose from, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"I am worried that they are already opening a second location, especially since it's so close to the original.

Love the carne asada tacos. Hate the parking situation. Love the mom-an-pop atmosphere.

And I love the fact that I can ride my bike there, not have to worry about parking, have a couple cold beers on a Friday night and relax."}
{"text":"I happen to have an appointment on Camelback. I usually go to the original America's on 7th Str south of Oak. This location was not that busy and it's much larger. The tables were so dirty. The area where the soda machine is was a mess! Lids to the drinks everywhere! Counters wet! Floors with spilled soda and water! Employees chatting away behind registers. And I always look before I close door, no toilet paper! Ugh... Tacos were good as usual but I'll stick to the 7th Str location..."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after I read about it in Sunset Magazine. I liked it a lot. The corn was d'lish, as was the Carne Asada Burrito, though it was a tad small for $5.45. (They offer a larger one for $7.95) I guess I'm spoiled living in San Diego where I can get a Carne Asada burrito for super cheap! But I have to say the meat here was wayyyy better than most I've had at home. There was not ONE SINGLE bit of fatty gristle in my burrito. 
And the burrito was simply made with only a few ingredients (meat, guac, pico de gallo, and onions) so I could really taste the smoky goodness of the meat. I liked it a lot. In fact, I liked it so much I went there twice in one weekend! 
Try the corn with cotija cheese - YUM! And also make sure to drink one of America's Margarita's. I liked the Tamarindo but my husband liked the Jamaica.  Heck, try both!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Tempe 2 months ago I had driven past this place numerous times and kept wondering what their food would be like. My family and I finally decided we would go try it out. Definitely was not the fanciest place and inside it was full of smoke. Not a problem...at least I know they are cooking the meat right. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with guacamole inside and America's way which meant it would have diced roasted jalapenos inside. They didn't have any sour cream which I thought was strange. The drink choices were also slim. 

Upon receiving my order, the XL bean and cheese burrito, I was a little disappointed because it didn't seem much bigger than a regular size burrito and yet it was like like $2 more. My burrito was just lukewarm and although I dont want it scalding hot it would be nice to have it warmer than what it was. By the time I was done eating it was definitely cold...quite disappointing again! My GF ordered the Chorizo burrito which she was very pleased with. Her only complaint was that everything was blended together that it was hard to distinguish the tastes of the ingredients. My dad ordered the Al pastor burrito and that was cold as well. :( My mom's carne asada burrito was lukewarm, but she seemed to be ok with it.

I'm hoping it was just a bad day for the crew as the place seemed like it would be good based on some of the reviews. It was slow and perhaps the crew was just slacking off that day..."}
{"text":"Geezus I wish I would have looked at the reviews first! This TINY burrito just cost me $7! I asked the size and she Did say 7\" but there is hardly anything in it! It might as well be called a rolled taco! SMDH I should have toughed out the line at Chipotle!! This is ridiculous. 
The guac in the carne asada burrito is okay. The salsa that comes with it is okay. The tortilla is pretty good - thank goodness it's not chewy like mission tortillas, but it could have been cooked longer or warmed up at the very least. Burrito wasn't even hot, much less warm. The meat had good flavor to it... Still WAY over priced for the amount/size of a cold burrito. 

Came in starving, left hungry."}
{"text":"Best customer service I have had in a while! Wish I would have asked for the kids name who was helping us because he definitely deserves a shout out. He was so friendly and willing to go the extra mile for us. I will definitely be going back simply because the service was on point."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Their Al Pastor meat is amazing and their customers service is fantastic! I couldn't be happier with it."}
{"text":"I know we're a captive audience at a baseball game, but $11.50 for a tiny, average tasting burrito that looks like my kid folded it is a crime. Avoid this place, there has to be better options here..."}
{"text":"went here yesterday for dinner had the special 4 chicken tacos for 6.95 they were good i also ordered a side of beans which were ok no chips are served with the side of beans or in general unless ordered as a side as well"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Wednesday. The carne asada vampiro was delicious!  Goes great with a Dos Equis  The service is quick, and the staff very nice. Worth many more trips!"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of King Taco in Los Angeles... The food is flight! . My favorite Taco/Burrito spot in phx"}
{"text":"I had the chips and guac for $2.99 and then I ordered the carne asada bowl. So yummy. They even gave me some limes to squirt on my food. It was so fresh and yummy!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Worth the walk away from all the touristy crap in Old Town to get some good tacos and burritos!"}
{"text":"The salsa tastes like tomatoes and tomatoes only. The \"refried beans\" and rice have zero flavor and the taco was just mediocre. The only decent thing was the $3.99 cheese quesadilla; and it's kind of hard to screw up a quesadilla. All and all, this was the most disappointing $25.48 I've ever spent. And I've made some pretty stupid purchases in my lifetime."}
{"text":"Blah.... the beans have no flavor, the red and green sauce are bland. The pico is good flavor. The portions are big but the food is lackluster. Filibertos blows this place out of the water"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! The burritos are even better and they have excellent customer service. Staff is always friendly. Super cute little place with delicious food!!"}
{"text":"The place has excellent customer service and it's very clean, however, they severely lack on the quality of the food. I ordered two Carne Asada tacos and a vegetarian quesadilla. Bad idea! The meat was dry and tough, the tortilla wasn't heated at all when they brought it to me and on the quesadilla, there was too much cheese, ugh. Also, the guacamole has no flavor what so ever. The quesadilla was bland and I really did have to smother it in Tapatio sauce to give it any flavor. On the bright side, the chips and salsa were decent and the employees and awesome but I think I will have to pass on this place again for lunch."}
{"text":"Finding a place with a large patio on a hot summer day can not be considered a great find.

We arrived and parking was so tight we had to park on a near by neighbor hood street.

Inside it was crowded with a long line to order.

Most items are available in regular and XL size. I went with a regular vegetarian quesadilla $3.75 and \"Americas corn\" 2.50, and was then given a number for my table.

My quesadilla arrived and it was much smaller than I expected and less cheesy, but the sautéed onions were good. The Corn is just a corn on the cob, covered in mayo and then some shredded cheese. Each dish comes with a small piece of cucumber and radish. 

On the table there is a large selection of hot sauces however they did not taste fresh to me.

My co workers got the carne asada and they liked it.

They have a 2-6 happy hr with $1 tacos cheap chips and beer I may try it again for a late lunch."}
{"text":"This place is OKAY. Based on all the hype and the price, I guess I expected more. A lot more? The food was decent and far from memorable. Their pomegranate margarita is good, but it came in the world's tiniest cup...it may have even been a thimble, I'm not sure. America's Taco Shop is still a cool spot in the valley and I appreciate that it's there, but in Phoenix where Mexican food places are everywhere you look, this will never be a priority stop for me. I'd rather eat the tacos from the Cocina at the 16th Street and Roosevelt Ranch Market. Really."}
{"text":"If you a full size adult you probly wont like this here,I ordered 2 tacos , they were tasty but big enough to feed a one year old , the cook had the a lack of friendliness and was unmotivated,I will say the cashier guy was friendly,6 bucks for 2 tacos,ill go to another place!"}
{"text":"I love tacos! And I love authenic tacos without fluff and gimic. I ordered the chicken taco and the Al Pastor pork taco. So good and super cheap, less then $6! Yay for good Mexican food that satisfies!"}
{"text":"I had heard how thwse tacos were so amazing and convinced the hubby to try something new.  Cute, tiny restaurant with a friendly man at the counter.  We ordered 7 tacos, a quesadilla, a side of beans, chips and drinks.  For everything,  our bill was nearly $40.  I thought that seemed pretty high,  but waited to receive our food to see if it was worth it.  The food was edible and had decent flavor.   However,  the portion size was super tiny.  The tacos did not have much meat in them and the quesadilla was made with about an 8\" flour tortilla.  Tiny.  Chips were thin and crisp with tasty salsa, but the hot salsa needs more heat.  Also, they are NOT FREE!!  The tortillas are store bought, which by the prices, I was hoping for homemade.  Overall, I was dissapointed with the lack of value you receive.  Even though the food was decent, I would not return."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place! I traditionally would always eat these type of tacos in Mexico on the side of the road hoping they were beef! lol... The carne asada tacos are excellent! You actually get all meat, no chewy surprises like at other places. I love them with lots of lime juice on them. I have also tried a carne asada quesadilla and it was great! Definitely stop by if you are in the area. You will love it."}
{"text":"I have been to a different location and I remember it being really good. It has been some years though, just to be fair. My tacos were just ok, but it was really expensive for two people to have lunch. The burrito was really small my friend had and we both left hungry $25 later.... no thanks."}
{"text":"I like the Vampiros.

It is fast food
But as fast food goes it's pretty good
Just stick to something if you like it. Otherwise you will be disappointed"}
{"text":"Dont expect to call here to set an order because they dont answer! I called three times and got thier voicemail. I go ahead to the resturant and ask if their phone is working correctly and the blonde cashier responds \"Oh someone must have been on the phone\" Uh excuse me is this not a business? And NO ONE EXPECTS A TORTA THAT HAS NOTHING IN IT! Paid $9.18 today at noon and got the smallest torta of my life. i even wait 10 minutes to get this. Might be able to keep white folks happy but sure as hell can't keep hispanic people happy.
Update:
OK. Besides the negativity, the Director handled things very well and I do not doubt that my next visit will be anything but excellent. I appreciated his prompt response, and he definitely made up for what was lacking. I will return and I am sure this time around I will be satisfied."}
{"text":"Average tacos.  Good flavor, but nothing special.

Dropped $26 on lunch for two.

Very small portions.  Tried the combo #1 - three different tacos for ~$7.5.  Each taco was significantly smaller than my hand -- I easily could have eaten two of the combos."}
{"text":"Massive portions for the price. I paid $7.99 for an XL burrito that was the length of a dinner plate.

The staff was quick, friendly, and the lemonade is fresh squeezed.

The highlight of this place is the outdoor patio. It is quiet and relaxed; just what I needed after a long day golfing.

In Texas we take Tex-Mex seriously, so this food was only average for me."}
{"text":"First time going to America's TS. Really enjoyed it. Employees were nice & helpful. Food was really good. Salsa's are not very spicy (which was fine by me). I also enjoy that they have the \"cool\" soda fountain with lots of different flavors. Definitely will add it to a place I'll frequent."}
{"text":"Pretty good. I have only been once. Fairly authentic. I would go again. The carne asada was flavorful but I wish there was more for the money!!! 
I think 3-4 tacos for the price would be better than 2. Just not enough food IMO. It was decent!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Phoenix locations so I too was glad to see this open close to home. The freshness and quality of the meat is what has me coming back for more. I'm sure it's pricier than some of the other fast food Mexican places you see on many corners around the valley, but the chicken, al pastor and carne asada here are far superior in taste and quality. The al pastor is my favorite because of the richness and tenderness of flavors. The beans are creamy and delicious and my chips have always been fresh and crispy. The guacamole with the chip trio is storemade and delicious.

The staff is trying hard to get this newest Taco Shop off the ground. They were friendly and accommodating. When I want fast, fresh tacos, burritos or quesadillas I will be stopping by. I intend to be a frequent customer !"}
{"text":"Love their beans, always get a bean and cheese burrito with whatever else I order.  Seriously- heavenly."}
{"text":"As far as the Via de Ventura location, it's a fast food taco place that falls way short of expectation.  The al pastor is bland, despite the impressive presentation of preparation with pineapple on the gyros spit.  It was boring and uninspired.  My wife's chicken was equally tasteless and dry.  Beans were good.  I don't think they make the chips fresh which is a prerequisite for the genuine Mexican experience.  I tried a few salsas, all were pretty good.  Don't know if they are making them from scratch.  Their website implies they do, but I don't know.

I'm impressed by the story of the owner and her business savvy and all that.  That's great.  The idea of an authentic-style taqueria near old town to suck in the tourists is genius business.  There was a niche there.  

I may check out the old town location, since I've never been there and have heard it's better.  It's better than Taco Bell and Del Taco, but it's not on par with the authentic family-run cantina style places.  Should have gone to Tacos Jalisco on 68th, never been there and were headed there when we decided we didn't want to do the drive.  $8 for the smallest king burrito I've ever seen.

I guess the bar for Mexican food for me is just a lot higher.  If you're used to the real-deal ma-pa places, the ones with the arched windows and the matador murals on the wall and last year's grime in the corner, you won't like this place.  If you're used to Del Taco, you will probably like it.  Just be sure to bring a few extra bucks.

They get an extra star because the people are nice and the beans and carne asada were decent.  DIdn't do the corn, and probably should have."}
{"text":"I ordered online for pick-up, and the taco shop messed up my order a bit--I didn't get a taco I ordered. Their carne is quite flavorful, although there isn't anything special about their chicken, and I can't write about their pastor because that was the item I didn't receive. The vampiros are quite tasty, and although their name might suggest so, they do not cause you to grow fangs.

The cochata, a mix of iced coffee and horchata, is quite unique, and I'd have to recommend that--their jamaica tastes far more like cranberry juice than it did hibiscus.

If my order wasn't messed up and if the service was faster (the cashier continually asked the other employees for help), the food could've merited four stars for the restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a fan! The carne asada burrito should be titled the chopped tomato burrito with a few bits of carne included & for the name American Taco Shop - ALL they played was Spanish music. Can't wait to move back to Texas and get real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food was cold. Ordered two tacos with rice. Lady taking order was rude. Did not engage in conversation. Looked bored. There use to be such nice ladies here. Disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by after church to grab some lunch. The staff was friendly and fast. The food was pretty good. I had a Carneasada Burrito which was good, my wife had the Taco Trio that was okay."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and it was really good.  I had the carne asada tacos and my friend had the pastor tacos.  Mine were really good and he said his were as well.  Reminded me of authentic street tacos from Mexico and not the more Americanized versions that most places have.  Note: corn tortillas standard, not flour tortillas, and they don't gunk up the plate with mounds of chees covered refried beans and starchy rice (this is a good thing).  There are plenty of places to go for that type of Mexican food if you want, but this has a much more authentic feel and taste to it.

Plus, they have really cool artwork on the walls for sale.

Only problem was that parking was not sufficient for the lunch crowd.

Really enjoyed it and will go back."}
{"text":"Was REALLY hoping that this place would be amazing...

It wasn't


Totally over-rated

Carne Asada is very bland

$1 tacos from taco trucks in LA BLOW this place away

Close by...such a shame"}
{"text":"Ever go to a place, but just before you pull in you have this gut feeling that you should just keep driving?  Yep, that's this place.  However, I had mixed signals because I had been there before, just once.  But it wasn't until I actually parked that I realized it.  However, I still didn't know WHY though.  I order a chicken burrito and then when I got it, BAM! The light went on.  The size of the meal...the BANG FOR THE BUCK!  That's why I had the gut feeling!

Needless to say, I felt like that kid in the movie, \"The Christmas Story\", who day after day ran to mailbox to check for his package.  Finally, upon getting it, he fills out the mysterious code which turns out to be nothing more than some stupid statement telling him to drink more Ovaltine?!  Well, that's how I felt upon walking away with that measly burrito for 8 bucks! - Like a sucker.   After sitting down in my car, I said to myself, HELL NO!  I'm not going to get jacked for 8 bucks for a POS burrito.  So I went back in and got my money back.  People are insane charging what they do for such skimpy portions.  Well, to the recent poster....there might be a reason why it's never crowded when you go in there - grimace proportions!"}
{"text":"I placed a pick up order online two hours before my pick up time of 12:30. The food didn't even come out for another 25 minutes. They served people that walked in after I did, that placed the order in person. What's the point of ordering online for a specific time and then having to wait another 25 minutes? Horrible service and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Great service, great carne asada and a pleasant patio on a beautiful day."}
{"text":"5 stars for the carne asada. I like al pastor tacos and here I didn't like them. So if you like carne asada tacos go here."}
{"text":"More expensive than it should be, but they have very good carne asada, and the only authentic el pastor I've found in Phoenix (cooked on a gyro rotisserie with a pineapple on top). Definitely the most authentic taqueria near ASU. The el pastor taco special on Tuesdays is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great burritos. Every time I have been their soda machine isn't working but the food is great. Wish they had rice."}
{"text":"So horribly disappointing, as per usual. Ordered 2 regular size bean and cheese burritos, a large order of chips and guac. and a Dasani water. This came to $17! A ridiculous price point for fast food Mex, but what made it worse is that the tortillas smelled like plastic. Our finger tips literally stunk like some weird chemical that was laced into the tortillas. The beans and cheese were tasteless. Which was just as well, because after I discovered the plastic smell was coming from my tortilla, I couldn't even finish. They only gave us 1 tiny salsa for 2 burritos. F'ing weird. Lastly, the chips were inedibly stale. 

I would have taken everything back and demanded my money, but it was take-out, and we were too far away when we discovered everything mentioned above. 

Hoping for a decent order at the counter place to open in it's place. A girl can dream. Until that happens, I'll just have to drive a little further to La Santisima."}
{"text":"HolaI! Me encanta Tienda de Estados Unidos Taco! Este lugar es adsolutely delicioso! Recomiendo el burrito de pollo - que está lleno de amor y pollo! El servicio es excelente y el ambiente es excepcional ... No me importa comer aquí todos los días! Pruébelo! Te va a encantar! Promesa.

If you can't read the top here is it in English:
HI! I love America's Taco Shop! This place is adsolutely delicious! I recommend the chicken burrito - it is filled with love & chicken! The service is great and the atmosphere is outstanding... I wouldn't mind eating here every day! Try it! You'll love it! Promise."}
{"text":"DH & I went there last night, the margaritas were ok...we had the corn, carne asada tacos, and a torta. We thought the meat didn't have very much taste. Both of us liked the salsa that came with the chips, but the salsa that came with the food was not as tasty. The place was ok, kind of overpriced & over hyped."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - love
Service - love
Food - mixed

My girlfriend got a carne asada burrito and Mexican style corn. I got a chicken quesadilla. I was very excited reading the list of ingredients, however I got none of the flavors in my quesadilla. Although it was our first time and they gave us chips and salsa, I found the salsa wonderful but the chips generic and stale. The tortilla on the quesadilla invited burrito I had were lackluster. However Jessica as it some of the best carne asada she has tried. I think I would try the place again and not get the chicken."}
{"text":"I wish I had read more of the reviews before I went to America's. I clearly did not order the right things. We got chips & salsa, carne asada tacos, and a vampiro. They were all good and we agreed that the salsa was excellent and the meat very high quality, but I was not blown away. Next time I will definitely try the corn, which looked amazing, as well as the carne asada burrito. 

Two things that bugged me about Americas:
1. We were a tad bit disappointed they did not have more choices on their menu. I understand keeping it simple, but if you are not in the mood for carne asada, you are kind of screwed. 
2. I love that they are selling real \"Mexican\" coca-cola, but it's a little expensive at $3 a bottle. 

Overall, cute (but very tiny) place that deserves a second visit."}
{"text":"The food here is nothing to brag about. I ordered the chargrilled chicken vampiro and it tasted bland. The sauces that came with it were bitter and ended up dousing my food with salt and pepper hoping it would taste better. The portions were smaller. I'll never come back here again. I felt I wasted my money."}
{"text":"Learn how to make a quality taco with taste.. Bland Bland Bland ! I'm mean this is a case of photo looks better than actual food itself. Only problem is I can't eat the photo without getting indigestion. 
 

I'm sure you will find another taco stand verse waste your hard earned money at this place."}
{"text":"Not the most friendly people I am used to seeing at Americas Taco Shop. 

I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and waited about eight minutes.  The torita seems like it was from day before and dry and cracking.  

There was a lot of steak in the burrito and it was good. The meat was definitely precooked.

Overall not bad for airport food. I highly recoomend American Taco Shop I tried in Scottsdale, it was amazing."}
{"text":"I ordered a couple of carne asada tacos and a large soda for $7.77. They have that soda dispenser that can deliver just about any soda known to man. They were out of the Diet Dr. Pepper so I was saying no bueno until I saw that they had Diet Barq's Rootbeer. Nice save!

The two carne asada tacos I had were basically two of the smallest tacos that I have ever seen. The taste was so so. They have a great outdoor patio and plenty of room in the dining area.

But I don't see myself coming back to America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"I can't remember eating better carne asada, or even a better bean burrito, this side of the border. Wash it down with a Mexican Coke and it's heaven. 

Notes: Interior is very small, maybe 5 tables total (but there's a patio). Service was very quick and friendly. Parking is easy and free."}
{"text":"My take on America's Taco Shop is that is Mexican Fast Food just not served that fast with quality protein. When you walk in you see the usual fast food looking kind of place.

We shared the two chicken tacos plate that is served with rice and beans.

The chicken they used in the taco seemed like a decent quality chicken that was prepared well and the chicken itself was tasty. I really didn't care for the way they grind up the vegetables in the taco. I thought it was weird and never seen anyone do such a thing anywhere here or in Mexico. But my least favorite thing about the taco was the avocado dressing. It was disgusting. This brought down the taco a few steps for me....sorry but the avocado dressing is awful and there was a lot of that dressing on my taco. It would have been better if the dressing was squirted on like in a thin drizzle so I wouldn't notice it so much. The taco also didn't have the fresh lively flavors that you usually taste in a taco. 

Beans are sort of spicy and above fast food standards. Rice seemed average.

Way better quality than Taco Bell..........

The people working there were all nice and the person that ran out our plate took the time to run me my own plate.

If you avoid the avocado dressing you will have a better experience than I did."}
{"text":"Honestly I didn't want to eat at the corporate version of the original Americas taco but it was just convenience at the time. I went in there expecting the worst and already have it one less star for it looking like the typical chain. To my surprise my breakfast I burrito used the same recipe as the original on 7th ave. the horchata... Not so much but I can't complain overall. I still will choose the 7th ave over all of them."}
{"text":"They were off their game! Took 40 minutes to get our food.  Tables were dirty, customers were unhappy, food was so-so.  Just lots of little things that really built up and made for an unpleasent visit, will be hard to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times. The service is always great and fast, and the beans are amazing. 

However, the food is ok. Nothing crazy that I would crave. If you're looking for something different than filibertos, then this is a good spot to hit up."}
{"text":"Charity Towing and America's Taco Shop must take great pride in a wonderful scam.  A huge several acre dirt lot on the corner of Marshall and 1st Ave is at the bottom of this luscious, money maker for both of them.  At least 15 cars were towed from this lot in the 1-1/2 hr time it took us to eat.  At $75 per car, they split an awesome amount of money.  The tow trucks pulled in and cleaned the lot out in record time.  

The signage indicating the lot was for America's Taco Shop only are located on non-permanent pails that are moveable by any person.  Very small and limited to two signs spread out over several acres.  Entering by Marshall one sign was turned completely around.  The other sign was located next to a bar entrance.  Not visible unless you parked on top of the sign, that's how small it was.  

The city allows this to happen?  America's Taco's is supposedly alerting it's patrons that they will be towed?  Not so.  What an amazing scam that is allowed to continue.  Truly scandalous."}
{"text":"I love America's Carne Asada, it has been rated the best in the valley several times and I can see why. My co-workers and I eat there at least once a week. Spring for the XL burrito extra spicy! Like others have said parking can be a bit of a pain during lunch but it isn't horrible, you can park on the street. $12 for a XL burrito and tamarindo drink is a little expensive compared to your chain fast food joint but this food is WAY better! So worth it!"}
{"text":"I miss going to this Americas Taco Shop in my old neighbor hood.  Glad to see they have more locations now!!  Love their carne asada and their salsa.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Had the carne asasda burrito, was like eating leather. The cashier walked away from me as I approached, and went to a table, that I'm assuming was friends or family and started to eat some fries. The next employee asked if she helped me. I said no. She replies with, what do you want. Bad customer service, and the burrito I had was dry and overall not so good.. I would recommend a different eatery at terminal 4 at phx shy harbor for some eats."}
{"text":"I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to throw my five stars in the pot.  I'm thrilled America's opened this second location!  I wasn't sure the service would be as friendly as it is at the other location, but it definitely is.  As expected, the new place is cool, decorated wonderfully, and is a great spot to visit with friends or swing by to pick up a quick order after work.  If I could throw an extra star to this location, I would.  Why?  I think the salsa is just a touch better, spicier, and more flavorful than it is at the 7th St. location.  Either way, I love this place!"}
{"text":"America's has, by far, the best bean & cheese burritos in the valley.  It's huge, cheesy, messy, and is almost as good as my Grandma used to make.  Today I scored an XL bean & cheese burrito, chips & salsa, and a large iced tea for under $8.  Service is really, really friendly and even during the height of the lunch rush, they're fast!  Love it!"}
{"text":"Second only to Los Taquitos in command of carne asada, this place has one of the best burros...a great option when you're near downtown Phx."}
{"text":"best tacos in town...awesome flavor...great $...fun place...we love it"}
{"text":"Meh.  Seems to be a little expensive for what you get.

Nothing \"wowed\" me at all.

Many places similar to this one give you better food, and more of it for your money.

By the way - I tried this place TWICE and had same experience both times."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted the food yet. But,it looks like it will be great! But,just on thr service alone,the hostess eas great,explained everything and since my food was going to take 15 mins to cook as I did to go,I was offered a full size drink of my choice! A full glass of horchata for no price and just a sign of great customer service!!! :)
Definitely a comeback spot for me! And,the place is little and cute and clean!"}
{"text":"I don't know why but I had really low expectations for this place the first time I ate here. I have been three times now and every time I am surprised by how great it is. They have awesome Al Pastor which you can get in a burrito, taco, tostada or quesadilla. You can actually see the meat roasting in the kitchen with a pineapple on top. Great salsas and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Years ago, I would have given America's a blazing 5-star review, but I feel their food has suffered since expanding throughout the Valley.

The food is still good, but the quality just doesn't seem to be the same. Especially when it comes to the salsas. The spicy and the mild taste about the same, when before there was a distinct difference.

The lard-free beans are still delicious, as are the carne asada tacos.

The 7th St. location is hands down the best, followed by the Old Town Scottsdale location. The food is bland at the newer locations and it seems like the salsas aren't freshly made."}
{"text":"The tortillas alone could make this place. 

I went at 12:30pm - got food and a table right away. I got the bean and cheese burrito with a side of guacamole. Everything was excellent and fresh. But the highlight, as mentioned, were the tortillas. They appeared to be homemade. And they were incredible.

The menu is limited, but also cheap. So I don't really see room for complaints there. The house the restaurant lives in is cute and cozy feeling.

I liked this place even more when I learned that America was the name of the owner and not some cheesy restaurant title."}
{"text":"Mexican food place that does not sell beer even though they have Corona & Pacifico signs. Mexican food place that is out of guacamole. Small tacos, dry flavorless meat. Dirty tables. Clueless staff."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I ordered the carne asada burrito and fell in love with the place.  I had the Cochata which is coffee and horchata.  I hate horchata, but this concoction was amazing.  I love guacamole, and there are very few places that serve guacamole with only avocado and lime juices.  This is probably why I love the burrito so much.  They also offer guacamole with tomatoes and onions, but I will not touch any of that.  The second time I went, however, my burrito did not taste as good, and neither did my cochata.  I was a little disappointed, but I do understand that different people work every day.  I will definitely keep coming here.  I wish they would open a bigger one!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just Cinco de Mayo, but I got here just before the lunch rush really got going to order a simple carne asada burrito (regular size) and I waited 45!! minutes for my bag. The kitchen reported they were really backed about 20 minutes into, because they had so many online orders. I had to complain to the owner himself to finally get my food (strange that it magically appeared once he asked what was going on...)
**Note to Mr. Bortin** Get rid of the online orders until you figure out your kitchen paces during the lunch rush. It's not fair to people who actually get off there butts to go and place an order at the restaurant by attending to the online orders. 
There were at least 15 disgruntled customers complaining about the back up.
The carne asada burrito - you can get better in LA for about $3.50. It's grand larceny to charge $5.75 for that appetizer size morcel. In fact all your plates sized are poor in value. The ceviche probably is the biggest joke of all.
At least they are smiling their way to the bank. Congratulations to the owners on duping the gueros out there who think because the owner's wife is from Mexico and the that the place isn't in a 'shady' part of town they are getting an equally comfortable and authentic Mexican taco shop experience. I guess that means paying \"guero\" prices too. How many Mexicans do you see queuing up for food in this place? Ninguno!  Think about it people, the value proposition is very low for a taco stand. Don't get caught up in the hype."}
{"text":"I visit America's Taco shop WAY too often! The food is delicious and the service is always great! Since discovering America's i have totally abandoned all my other previously favorite mexican food places."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a while now as it is super close to my house! Always consistently great food and good service. I always get the bean and cheese burrito (which is made w/o Lard) with carne Asada.. it's amazing. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times total.  The first time I had no problem.  The second time I was sick to my stomach.  I figured it had to be something else since I had eaten here before with no problem.  The third time I was so ill I almost had to leave work.  There will be no fourth time."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place and today was the day.  The place was bright and clean, always a good sign. The menu was clear and simple. I ordered the large carne asada quesadilla. The salsa, the guacamole and chips were delish! Sadly they do NOT offer sour cream at all. My quesadilla was $8 and def not worth the price. Not only was the meat burnt but there was hardly any cheese in my quesadilla.... Def won't be back"}
{"text":"BURSTING with FLAVOR! Omg!!! It was catered today for our office lunch. It was sooooooooooooo Goooood. Chips /salsa with cuac. The perfect amount of salt on chips. Delicious! Salsa was perfect not hot. The tacos were perfectly topped off with there green salsa it was a combination of sweet/ tangy just perfect! . I will have to stop by and visit a location for sure."}
{"text":"Self loathing isn't for everyone, but it does work for me. 
Enter, America's Taco Shop. 

Yes, when I find myself between alcohol-fueled introspections and waking up naked in the driveway, I troll for food here. 
 
Chips and salsa are decent.
Carne asada burrito is above average.
Bean burritos will produce room clearing farts, like a horse fart or something. 
I have no experience with their bean burritos, this is merely a rhetorical statement, kinda like the sky is blue.

But you probably already knew that.
Anyway, if you hate your life, and are between interventions, try America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"I love America's Taco Shop. The horchata is to die for! I especially love the large patio - it'd be perfect for a special event. The menu is simple and tasty. Authentic Mexican food from the area in Mexico where the family is from. America is the namesake of the concept, and she seems passionate about keeping authentic recipes available. 

Try the cochata - a coffee-flavored horchata. YUM! Love the chips and salsa too :)

Burritos are tasty - they're known for their carne asada so you can't go wrong there!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner we were only customers. Three girls behind the counter hovering over a cell phone laughing. One girl put her hand up and said we will be right with you. Ordered tacos an margaritas, we finished our food before our drinks came. We wont go back.

Thanks for the offer, but there are to many choices in this neighborhood to suffer thru another bad experience even at no charge."}
{"text":"Less is more...NEED I say more?...ok, don't mind if I do...lol! The menu is actually extensive but I'm merely impressed with the tacos. They are very delicious and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"I been here before and I really don't remember much from the first time, but I was looking for a place for lunch and decided to come back.  First thing that I noticed was that they had a special running, 4 tacos chicken or al pastor for 6.99.  Wow that is like 1.75 a taco, not much of a deal.  I came in and didn't see much on the abbreviated menu.  No meals with beans and rice, just tacos, burritos, and tortas if I remember right.  I decided I would get the special and split between 2 chicken and 2 al pastor.  I also asked for chips and was surprised to see that I had to pay for a small basket with salsa.  Well I wanted chips so I forked my money over.  The tacos were not bad, but this is the weird part.  I have had al pastor many times, and for some reason this one tasted like Chinese BBQ pork.  I swear if I didn't know better it might have been.  Over all the place was not that bad, but 2 blocks either way , you can get way better food."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place after taking the wrong exit off the 101.  The carne asada is amazing & the pricing is extremely fair.  Two tacos (full size, not street size), chips & salsa, and a beer for under $10!  I'll be frequenting here often."}
{"text":"Love the carne asada burrito! We visited around 8:00PM on a Sunday night and the place was a little dirty. The tables were clean but there were a lot of broken chips on the floor. Maybe they just had a busy rush? It really didn't bother me but it was noticeable. The staff was friendly and we were greeted upon entering the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with some friends met up here and there was mixed reviews.  I ordered the carne asada burrito - because they claimed to be home of the best carne asada in the Valley.  Totally not true.  The burrito was pretty blah, boring, and certainly not the best carne asada.  I was super excited  to see they had street corn and ordered that as well.  Totally disappointing.  I've never had street corn that tasted and looked like it was dipped in mayo.  A little too liberal with the usage of mayo for my taste. 

My friend ordered the special which came with a veggie quesadilla.  It had guacamole in it - that's it.  Nothing else.  It didn't even make sense. 

The salsa was boring.  That's really all there is to say about it.  

All around, it was very average and uninteresting.  Too many other good places in DPHX to go to get quality Mexican food. 

The one saving grace and the only reason I'll even consider going back was the beans that came with my friends special.  I tasted them and they were delicious.  I will for sure come back and try a bean and cheese burrito."}
{"text":"Best Beans I have ever had.  Ate to Bean Burritos and Carne Asada Taco and let me tell ya, a few hours later....................................."}
{"text":"One visit and it will instantly merit inclusion into your lunch lineup.  The place looks the part- down to the vintage Shakira playing in the background- and its dishes deliver the goods. No longer will we have to rely on the Filoberto's/Aliberto's/Raliberto's/Rigoberto's of the valley to get our cheap Mexican fix on.  

Many people have mentioned the elote (corn) and I would like to second their approval. The ceviche is also great and the vampiro brings a little class to the standard street taco.  

People may complain about the diminutive menu but I say there is no need to when you do those few things well.  Do you same people whine about the lack of options at the In-N-Out?  Simple is good when the few items are excellent."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened but somewhere between their early days in Central Phoenix and this Scottsdale location the quality and experience has plummeted.  This used to be a true 'go-to' spot for us and now it is rarely considered.  Based on the recent reviews I'm not the only one who has this sentiment."}
{"text":"Everything was just bland.  Maybe we are taco snobs but this place made Rubios look like amazing fancy tacos and everyone knows Rubios is decent but not amazing.

We tried all three tacos types.  The pastor was overcooked/dry but did have good flavor.  The carne was juicy but lacked any flavor.  The chicken was just bland.  

We also tried all three burrito types and found the same in them.  The bean and cheese burrito was alright but still nothing special. 

The al pastor salad was better but the meat was cold and still dry.  The dressing was decent and the lettuce crisp.

One last thing, the salsa for the chips was like that pureed tomato salsa that is watery.  It did have some barely there jalapeno flavor.  We tried the hot and the mild but both tasted the same.  Maybe they gave us two milds. 

The service was very good though.  Everyone was friendly and the place was clean.  We just didn't enjoy the food."}
{"text":"What taco shop.doesnt have shrimp?  Options are limited. Location loud and i thought over priced for the quality."}
{"text":"I went in here today hoping that I would be able to get a quick burrito on my way home. I ordered chips and salsa and a carne Assad burrito and a half hour later was served a bean and cheese burrito. Needless to say, it was well over an hour before my order was completed and all of the carne asada was burnt anyways! Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"These Tacos Pack A Punch

I am a self-proclaimed Mexican food junkie. However, I am spoiled.  Having lived  in the southwest, where we tend to, critique our Mexican Cuisine harshly at times. As for.me, I demand high-quality Mexican food, that is well-prepared, and well-seasoned, and America's Taco doesn't disappoint. I have eaten at America's Taco at least a dozen times at various locations and all locations served delicious food. 

America's Taco offers a small menu and an even smaller seating area however, the food is really good. America's Taco is a no frills establishment.  You place your order at the counter, take a seat, and your entrée is brought to your table. 

I have tried many of the menu items at America's Taco and have never been disappointed.  America's Taco Shop has some of the best Carne Asada I have found in the Phoenix Metro Area. However,  as delicious as the Carne Asada is, my favorite are the Tacos Al Pastor.  These tacos are just so savory. The Tacos Al Pastor are street style tacos, served on corn tortillas, with sweet and tangy pork, fresh cilantro, and pineapple, these tacos pack quite a punch. I enjoy the Taco Trio (a Chicken, Al Pastor, Carne Asada).

If you find yourself in the area, you should stop by, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've stopped by two different locations now.  One off 7th st which is in an old run down house.  And his location which looks like a commercial cookie cutter version. So far I've only had the large breakfast burrito with carne Assad. Not sure why this location only has 2 stars but I've enjoyed the burrito with scratch tortillas and salsa. There has to be a reason. The burrito is pretty dang good and came out in less than 4min. I don't know about the other items yet but I'll def give them a shot soon.  Maybe it's the name? Lol"}
{"text":"America' Taco Shop left me disappointed. I saw their outside sign for $2 street tacos. Somewhat intrigued and little hungry, I decided to give them a try. I had the carne asada and chicken street tacos.  My first thought was \"Where is The rest?l  I thought maybe they had forgotten to put them all in the bag. But, I saw them I had to laugh.  They are the smallest street tacos I've ever had. The tortilla shell was 3\" round. They were more like a teaser. They tacos were okay. Nothing to brag about. The meats were cold and seems as if they were sitting out a bit. They weren't as flavorful as I had hoped. 

Update-  To be fair, At the time many places I didn't realize many places are serving these bite-sizes tacos. Hence, the size. Although, I still didn't care too much for the flavor."}
{"text":"Finally, I have a favorite Mexican food place downtown!   The carne asada taco's are as amazing as they claim,  simply melt in your mouth delicious. You can't order a meal without getting the guacamole too, it's awesome.  Top it off with some Horchata and you have a great meal, which is also affordable.   Terry (owner) is really friendly, drives a cool car and just built a new deck to expand seating options at the restaurant.   Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"I've only been to America's taco shop out in Tempe. That place is legit, though it has been a little bit since I've been out there. When I went in to the Camelback location they were out of the al pastor and the Americas corn. WTH?!? They have like three items they serve. THREE (It used to be just 2-the carne asada and al pastor meats) How do you run out of one of the MAIN things you serve on a Saturday night? Definitely Poor management. I won't be back. And on a side note-I did leave after finding that out. I went to their seventh Street location and they were also out of corn. The quality was also definitely lacking. Whats going on ATS?? You used to be one of my go-to's where I knew I would get some solid grub. I'm going to seriously have to rethink going back again bc its simply not worth paying 2.75 for a tiny taco thats luke warm and didnt even have all the fixings on the Al Pastor taco (missing the pineapple). I think now that ATS has become a chain, the quality and portions have taken a sharp nose dive."}
{"text":"Honestly I don't even want to give it one star. I went here a while back and never again will I come back. First off, it's over priced. I got the carne asada tacos and it was the worst quality tacos I've ever had. Like I can't even begin to describe how unsatisfying this was."}
{"text":"A buddy of mine put me on to this place and I'm so glad he did. AMAZEBALLS!

The atmosphere is really laid back and quaint. AWESOME outside patio area, incredible food and great low prices. WINNER!"}
{"text":"It was fine. Tacos were too small, but flavorful. Cooked fresh. Guacamole in squeeze bottle was weird.  I don't like guacamole, so I can't comment on how it tasted (my wife didn't like it). Al pastor was unique and tasty.

Not bad for a food court place, though a bit pricey for tiny tacos.  Next time I may try a burrito (it looked bigger from what I could see, but also cost more)."}
{"text":"The carne asada is really flavorful and lean, but I have to say the pastor is the star.  A very clean, friendly local place with really solid food.  I haven't decided if it a good or bad thing this place is so close! :)"}
{"text":"Still love the America's at 7th St., but I've noticed that the ones that have been franchised (like the one at Camelback and 16th St) are not as good.  Still pretty good, but not the same."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places. Pastor quesadilla and bean burritos to die for. Also the house salsa is wonderful. Cant stay away from this place."}
{"text":"Trip three thry burned the carne asada tacos. Andbthey triedbto tell me they make it charred. I know I like it charred. but who likes burned food. now I expect to get it rare"}
{"text":"Super affordable, cute little taco shop in the neighborhood. Counter service only. I went with my boyfriend and we both had the taco trio. I got a cochata  (coffee and horchata) and he got a Mexican Coke. I wasn't impressed with the cochata, it tastes like a powdered mix and is way too sugary. The tacos were great, though. My least favorite was the al pastor, nothing wrong with it, I just liked the other two more. Both the chicken and the Carne had a great charred flavor and the hot sauces accompanied them great. Service was also fantastic. Someone even came and took my tray when I was done, despite it being the kind of place you empty your own tray. Our total bill was just $22, which I think is a great value for everything."}
{"text":"I could eat Mexican food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Oh wait, I usually do as green chile is my all-purpose condiment.  Unfortunately, the pickings in Scottsdale are slim.  So I was thrilled when ATS opened a location here, two in fact!  My husband favors this location over Old Town, although it is closer and we've never eaten there to begin with!  Regardless, this location is just fine and they have Mexican Coke in 16 oz bottles!

I usually get tacos because in my mind, corn tortillas over flour erase the calories in the tub of guacamole and large quantities of chips I will also be consuming.  I really like the carne asada, and the chicken is okay, too.  But the Al Pastor is my favorite by a landslide.  So much so that I have to remove a star for not having it on a Saturday afternoon.  I guess it's everyone else's favorite, too.  However, when almost your entire menu is built off of only beef, pork, or chicken, running out of one is kind of a big deal in my book.  But it's so good, I'll come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I tried their carne asada burrito they recommended.  It was bland,  hardly any substance,  extremely cold and the meat nothing but FAT and hard cartillage. Poor quality meat and at $10 for a small serving.  YUCK."}
{"text":"I just recently started coming to this place, and I won't stop! The food is great, and I love the diversity of flavors. If you haven't tried this place, make a stop here. And please don't forget the ceviche!"}
{"text":"I was recommended to try their breakfast burrito by the cashier, although it was a great price and left me some what satisfied for my hunger it had very little meat to it and was pretty flavorless."}
{"text":"Probably the best carne asada and margaritas on earth.  

The meat is fresh and a good cut.  It's been marinated perfectly and grilled over an open flame shortly within your order being placed.  I was hooked on the first bite.

The salsa is so fresh and delicious.  The perfect amount of spice and sweet and you can tell it is probably freshly prepared daily.

Don't even get me started on the Jamaica Margarita.  It is so damn good, I wanted to bathe in it.  I ordered two of them the first time I went.  I girl behind the counter came out to ask me if the margarita was good because she had just made the batch fresh before I came in.  I told her the only problem was the glass was too small.

You have to try this place.  Everyone I know loves it and I didn't know it even existed until a few months ago."}
{"text":"I guess as with any restaurant, people either love or hate it.  I fall somewhere in the middle.  I have been here a couple of times and always had an ok experience.  Last night I tried the Pastor Burrito.  It was filled with pork flavored with Pineapple. I guess I expected it might have something else in the Burrito like beans, cheese, rice but it only contained just the meat.  For $7.95 I also thought it was on the small size.  

On an unrelated note, I noticed they have electrical wiring running on the wall above the cash register.  Please keep in mind the nearest exit just in case the place bursts into flames."}
{"text":"If you find yourself stuck at PDX and are in need of food, you could do much worse than eating at America's Taco Shop at Terminal 5. 

The staff here are friendly and professional. I had a chicken quesadilla and they loaded it with very delicious cubed chicken from their griddle. Also, they have totally kickass habanero sauce. Come here, eat lots of delicious food before getting on your big flying germ tube to whatever your destination might be."}
{"text":"Oh.  Mah.  Gawd.

Let me get this out of the way.. the ONLY reason I'm dumping a star on America's Taco Shop is because they charge extra for chips and salsa.  I HATE that.  Charge me if I ask for extra salsa or something, but otherwise, come on.  

Now.  Said chips?  Perfect.  Salsa?  Perfecter.  My taco?  Made me cry a little bit.  I am picky about corn tortillas, but these were brilliant.

Go to America's Taco Shop.  I will see you there."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken taco today.   Chicken is the only meat I eat so I cannot vouch for the other options.   What can I say?  It was your basic taco.  Corn tortilla, I couldn't pick up any particular flavor from the chicken.  I guess I was expecting more of a smoky or maybe lime marinade.  Although not a big hit with the flavor, it was moist. The taco also has guacamole, cilantro, and Caramelized onion.   Personally I enjoy the stronger flavor of raw onion.   The menu lists lettuce should be on the taco, but that must have been missed on my order.   Nothing was great, but nothing was bad either.   I was pleased to see fresh brewed iced tea, regular or tropical."}
{"text":"I'm kind of a one-trick pony when it comes to anything southwestern. Let's be honest: I am norcal at heart, and I'm sure all my reviews reflect this in one way or another, so let's not kid ourselves and think that America's Taco Shop isn't going to be compared at least once to Pescado's (now called something else, I'm afraid), in Sactown.  

However, my one-tricks were all satisfied in one quick dash here for lunch today. I already had a hunch that it would be pretty good, because I do like american urbanized mexicanesque food. I had to park down the street (past the no parking signs on Campbell) because the lot was full. The smell of meat and tortillas did permeate the corner - much nicer than what I usually smell on my daily walk around the nearby canal and Chinese Buffet. Inside, a familiar sound - Mana's album Amor es Combatir was playing over the sound system. White alternagirl heaven! I even found myself lip syncing along to Labios Compartidos (thank you to Cadet Beltran for your beautiful stories of Mexico City and introducing me to the only band in Spanish that I have in my collection). But all of this is probably irrelevant to you, the food seeker.  I had the Vampiro and a carne asada taco. Why the Vampiro? Because I wanted to say Vampiro.  And it was good. I liked that the tortillas used on the taco are soft corn and not deep fried in any way. I agree with other writers, however, that 7.88 for lunch left me hungry (next time I won't get the 1.50 canned soda). Taco Tuesday brings you 4 tacos for 6.75 and that might be the way to go: the tacos are small.  I don't usually order Carne Asada anywhere because I prefer shredded chicken when possible. Red meat being the only option, however, seems a good idea because they can concentrate on what they do well: shredded meat, seasoned and crisped satisfactorily. I will be back because it's a 3 minute drive from work It would be a 20 minute walk but I only have a 30 minute lunch. Maybe I better start taking hour long lunches so I can walk off some of the red meat. I'll be sure to put Mana in the playlist when I do so.

And not a single reference to Pescado's, or anything else Norcal, for that matter. Please don't tell me that Phoenix is starting to grow on me."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhmeric's! I LOVE the bean & cheese burrito both America's & Terry's way!!! Also, the el pastor taco is a sure win! Not sure what else pastor is? Oh man, slow cooked marinated pork & they put slivered pineapple on top! Great chips & salsa! I usually get the mild salsa but I'm sure the spicy is delicious too! The food is always great! Fan for life! I find that it's a great place to pick up to go, but a nice enough casual dine in spot too! If you haven't tried it, you must! Plus, it's local! Yay!"}
{"text":"The Carne Asada vampiros are my favorite, but the bean burrito, Terry's Way (of course, of course) is such a delicious treat! On the weekends, you can order the ceviche, which I recommend. I like that they have Coca Cola with sugar, and the corchata - a coffee/horchata combo - is one of my favorite mid-day perk-me-ups! I like the carne asada, but the chicken tends to be over cooked for my preference. The al pastor is really flavorful, but I really can't under emphasize their yummy beans!"}
{"text":"For lunch, my pal and I hit up America's Taco Shop, the self-proclaimed \"home of the greatest carne asada in the Valley!\"

Its menu is small, but that doesn't mean it disappoints. Choose from items such as tortas, quesadilla and tacos, and be sure to pair it with the great chips and perfectly spicy salsa, at a cheap $1.50 a basket.

I ordered a vegetarian extra-large bean and cheese burrito, and I was really impressed with how ooey-gooey the bean/cheese mixture was and how flaky the flour tortilla was. It was the perfect lunch portion and filled me up without bogging me down.

My pal ordered the carne asada taco, which he said was excellent as always.

The spot's super-casual, really fast and has a patio to sit on, making it a great lunch spot full of tasty comfort food."}
{"text":"Americas Taco Shop in general is where I go when I've got a craving for a good bean and
cheese burrito. I don't even really care for refried beans (and these are without lard,yay!) But man, these are so amazing. The hot salsa is great and a cochata to wash it down is amazing! I'm not even a big fan of horchata but mix it with iced coffee and I'm sold. I was actually addicted to it for a few months a couple years ago! This location isn't quite as nice as the one on Camelback but who cares, it's a quick taco shop!"}
{"text":"Holy Maná! Do you not play any other music?! In this wonderful and modern technological world we live in, it IS possible to switch up artists and stations. Get with it. Decent food.."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night and I got the shrimp tacos ! Amazing! Clean and good portion size"}
{"text":"I drive by this taco shop treat on a daily basis and love shopping in the Melrose District. Mexican food restaurants line the streets of Arizona like every day is Cinco de Drinko, so I had to check them out and see how they earn the title of America's Taco Shop. 

During the work day, I'm on the hunt for lunch spots where I can be in and out without a true sit-down experience. Someplace with an outdoor patio is a plus, unless it's a sauna outside. America's Taco Shop had just that. You enter and order at the counter, then you can chose indoor or outdoor seating. Sadly, it was a bit windy when I went and in addition to my plastic silverware running away from me, the misters decided I needed a mid-afternoon shower. 

With such Yelp reviews, I felt the pressure when ordering my food and wanted to make sure I got the real experience, so I asked the cashier what his favorite choice was. He said the Carne Asade Burrito was hands down his favorite. I'm not going to question the man who lives and breathes by the restaurant.  They brought me chips and salsa while I waited. The chips tasted fresh and probably homemade. The salsa had a hint of a kick to it but not enough to send you to the fire hydrant. Then came the burrito. The tortilla was homemade, fresh and like it was straight from Mexico. Very tasty! The burrito itself was pretty darn good. I'm a sucker for guac so I wish I'd asked for some on the side. I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this burrito pretty much melted in your mouth. 

So on days when I'm a lunchtime loner or the social butterfly with friends, I'll definitely recommend this spot for tacos....wish I could have tried the margaritas. 

Cha Ching! The cashier pointed out two great traits. 1. Taco Tuesdays: four tacos for $6.00. Not bad! 2. Happy Hour. The happiest hour of them all with $2 beers and $1 tacos. Looks like I'll also be making a stop on my way home from work!"}
{"text":"This place isn't what it's cracked up to be. We were downtown and decided to go. We heard from some friends that this place was really good. They said they have the best carne asada but it's actually just mediocre. 

If you want really good Mexican food you should try out Los Taquitos, they have the best Mexican food in the valley. They were also featured on diners drive-ins and dives, so that gives them a little bit of cred."}
{"text":"This place started off great a few years ago. Quality ingredients and good prices! They actually used to have some good tacos and burritos that would compete with authentic Mexican cuisine, at a reasonable price. Now, its a joke and a mere shell of its former self. They have hired low-wage high school kids as staff who don't understand customer service. Prices have gotten outrageous ($9 for a Chipotle-style burrito with flavorless beans and rice as filler), the servings are miserly, they expect you to tip in a typical/cliché passive-aggressive manner, and the food has devolved into corporate boilerplate machinery. Not sure what changes management initiated with this location, but it's a fantastic example of corporate cost/benefit analyses run amok, to the detriment of the customer. Seems very typical these days, once a restaurant gathers a following, the management tries to squeeze every dime out of the place and the food suffers miserably. Try locally owned Espo's, right up the street on Chandler Blvd, instead. At least there you know your $$$$ is going to a locally-owned family venture who actually cares about quality and repeat clientele."}
{"text":"\"Home of the Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley\" is a pretty bold statement for a restaurant to make in a city where there is a taco shop on just about every street corner.

For me, good carne asada is all about the quality of the meat, marinade and cooking method. These are the qualities that separate America's Taco Shop's carne from others around the Valley.

Located in a charming little old house along Seventh Street, you'll find that this place is just cute as a button. In front, there is a patio and covered bar stool seating on the porch. There is parking out back as well as along Monte Vista to the north. But don't park in Coronado Café's parking lot they'll have you towed.

Inside are hardwood floors and an old fireplace. There's definitely a homegrown feeling here, like some of the other homes turned restaurants. It's so Phoenix.

Ordering is all about counter service, so you place your order, they hand you a number card and you find a seat.

Carne asada is the name of the game here, and while the beef-centric menu has only a handful of items, there are a few vegetarian options. Some of these include a Bean and Cheese Burrito in two sizes ($3.25/$5.75), America's Corn ($2.50) and a Vegetarian Quesadilla ($3.25). When available, America's Corn is a cob of sweet white corn, slathered with mayo, then sprinkled with cotija cheese, chili and lime. What a great way to get your whole grain and fiber.

On Friday and Saturday, America's Taco Shop features Ceviche ($5.95), but unfortunately it was marred by a strong shrimp flavor. Chips and salsa ($1.50) were good, with a nice balance of salty crunchiness and a little kick with the house-made salsa.

Now for those of us who love the meat, we're hoping for the \"Greatest Carne Asada in the Valley.\" With such high expectations, does America's Taco Shop statement hold true?

In all of its beefy glory, America's carne asada is set apart by using high quality well-trimmed meat. I tried each conception on the menu, twice, and not once did I bite into any gristle or fat. I got mouthfuls of tender, flavorful chopped beef.

The Torta ($5.95) was expertly prepared, taking toasted bread and covering with mayo, guacamole, jalapeño, lettuce, tomato and heaps of meat. Another variation is called the Vampiro ($3.25), a crunchy grilled corn tortilla with melted jack cheese, guacamole, lettuce and caramelized onions. In reverse is the Taco de Carne Asada ($2.25), with less cheese and served on a fresh corn tortilla. Both hit the mark with plenty of tasty meat.

The Carne Asada Burrito ($5.45/$$7.95) is simple, yet amazingly fantastic. A flaky grilled flour tortilla is filled with like the others chopped beef, guacamole, pico de gallo and caramelized onions. It's that perfect mix of fresh chewy flour tortilla and tender meat that makes this one of the best carne asada burritos I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I fly to to PHX for work (in the airport) regularly,  and for years have had the same options: Paradise Bakery (which is good but I try to limit bread intake) and a sub-par Mexican joint that seemed typical of airport fare. (and Burger King.)

I was pleasantly surprised today when I got to the food court for a quick, small lunch and found it 100% remodeled with what looks like decent food options from many new vendors. The employee at American Taco Shop informed me they were going for a more local feel with locally owned vendors mostly. 

I was happy to be able to order 2 a la carte tacos for under $6, where at other airports I've had to order a full meal plate which had far too much food and cost nearly $12. The staff was friendly and choices good,  and the food was also good.  

A new generation of airport eateries is taking over,  for which I'm very thankful. Thanks American Taco Shop for making my lunch hassle free and tasty."}
{"text":"The bean burrito here is like none-other. It seriously will make you crave it and have you coming back -maybe eve twice a day. It is lard-free and just amazing. America's Taco Shop is also known for their carne asada... I would say it is a nice second. I love their salsa and iced tea as well!"}
{"text":"No complaints! My carne asada burrito hit the spot and it's really close to my work! I will definitely be back with my work friend Melissa. The prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"after a morning of errands, i met the wife here for our first try at America's taco shop. 

very simple. very good. the veggie quesadilla however was so basic, i was a bit surprised. it seemed like there was only lettuce and guac and that was it. we also had the bean burrito and the refried beans were more of a puree bean paste than anything else. it was messy eating but i still liked it. 

the ceviche was delicious. the sauce on the side was the fantastic and we practically licked the little cup clean. 

i hear they have a decent happy hour. we paid about 14 bucks between the 2 of us."}
{"text":"Great tacos and salsa. I had pork and carne asada. Latter was the best. Regular salsa was Spivey enough for me. Recommend for authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"The PHX airport has many decent dining opportunities, especially Terminal 4.
Today, I tried America's Taco Shop. Since I wasn't that hungry I only ordered one chicken taco. There were only two other guys waiting for their orders but it still seemed like a long wait for 1 taco.
The taco was just ok. It was bland and I did not enjoy the texture of the tortilla."}
{"text":"The food was not tasty at all. I ordered a carne asada quesadilla reg size, it was a good portion but it's got a funny taste. I understand you're not gonna like everything on the menu but I tried to find something basic. I did not enjoy it. What I did enjoy was the fact that there was a girl walking around asking the customers how their meal was. When she got to me she could see I was not pleased. Immediately told her manager and they gave me a full refund and replaced my meal with something else, even though I didn't enjoy that either. I went with the grilled chicken salad, I think the guacamole they use is just not good at all and it's overpowering the rest of the dish. So for the food it would be 1 star but because of the excellent service I give them 3 stars. I will not be back, but if you want good service this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Love America's Taco Shop!  Carne Asada Burrito, that is all you need to know.  Nice people, fair prices, and good food.  If you are looking for an easy sit down dinner or lunch in the downtown area you should check out this place.  A+"}
{"text":"The location is really cute. We ate outside, it was nice considering how hot it was. People were complaining about it not being original mexican food.. That's why it has America in the name.. It was good for the price and the location. Not the best tacos or burritos ever obviously."}
{"text":"Very unhappy! I arrived 40 minutes before they were supposed to close and the doors were locked. They decided to close early. This has happened to me 3 times!  I drove about 17 miles to get there...this is no way to run a business."}
{"text":"Tacos were good, love the outdoor patio...sauce very good that goes with the \"chips and sauce\". I tried the El Paston, quite delicious and the chicken taco..good but better when you dip it in the mystery citrus sauce it comes with...then i had a carne asada taco, also good and some sort of mango tea. the patio is cute and tropical looking, plants all around, quiet no street noise."}
{"text":"Bean burrito here is so delicious! Reminds me of my Tia's beans in Mexico:-). Their al pastor tacos with pineapple are perfect...mmmm, mmmm! I've been to the 7th St, Chandler and Old Town Scottsdale locations...all are consistent, friendly, good service...always great food! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"We had overpriced food. It's decent food. But if you want good tacos go to taco Mitch plus people here are kinda rude."}
{"text":"Tried several different things and really liked it all!  I thought the flavors were really great and overall was impressed and will definitely go back!  The vampiros were tasty and the bean and cheese burrito was delish as well!  I thought the customer service was fantastic too.  Overall, I would recommend it to others and will be going back.  I knock down one star just for the slightly pricey menu items and the taco kind of fell apart as I was eating it."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! Very quick service. We love coming here on Sundays for $1 off breakfast burritos. The chorizo breakfast burritos are the best! We haven't had anything here that we didn't like. Carne asada quesadillas are so different and delicious!"}
{"text":"I will not return. I got the ceviche special. They should NOT call it ceviche.The ceviche tostadas had no fish and barely a piece of shrimp on each one. It was tomato and onion and was more like salsa or pico de gallo. Also, the inside smells bad, unappetizing bad, so I sat outside."}
{"text":"Amazing staff! Always helpful even when they are packed! The food isn't exactly authentic but it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Personally, I Love Americas. 

There Margaritas are delicious. There Breakfast, Bean and Cheese, and Carne Asada Burritos are Fantastic, and they have a decent happy hour.

Americas 4 Life."}
{"text":"Very little variety. Their ingredients don't really seem fresh. The rice and beans had very little flavor. The portion seemed good for the price paid. I had the grilled shrimp tacos- they were stacked with well prepared shrimp and iceberg lettuce. The shrimp had pretty good flavor. Was a good quick stop for a taco craving but I would most likely only ever return to check out their happy hour offerings."}
{"text":"I think I am more of a fan of the layout of the place. I love sitting outdoors and this has a great outdoor seating area so this was a plus for me. 

The food was great, although all I had was a carne asada burrito...which was awesome. Also the chips and salsa were very good, the man who took our order at the register also came out later and asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa which I thought was 
nice. If I did not get a large salsa with my chips I would have needed more to go with my burrito. Also, if I had not ordered the chips I might still be hungry because the burritos were a little on the small size. (Thanks Chipotle for ruining that for me)

I'm looking forward to going back for happy hour, and if you friend them on facebook I believe you get info on specials on certain days.
 
So if you are looking for a really great place to sit outside and have some great burritos and beer i would recommend this place first to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good tacos!and try  drink made home,Jamaica flower for exemplar,it's very nice drink!I will go back very soon"}
{"text":"I received a nasty note from a user named Michael M. from Chandler for this review.  He has no reviews of his own and has bookmarked this page. Guess he's the owner or a manager? Rather than harass your customers, maybe you should try actually making decent food at a good price. The last thing PHX needs is more bad Mexican.

---

Average to below-average mexican food at uptown prices.  I know these folks get a lot of praise for their downtown location, but the food at the Tempe location did not impress me at all.   I ordered carne asada tacos and was horrified to find a thick layer of slimy guacamole in between the meat and tortilla.  Filthy :(

I'm also not down for paying $3 for a 7 cent soft drink or paying stadium prices for a beer.  

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Well I have been back 3 times since I've wrote my original review. I heard right away from Zachery J. Riddell, the owner. He said he was going to make sure that there was corn when I came in. Only one of those three visits did they have corn. I usually go around 5:30 , 6:00 pm. One would think that there should still be corn.I could under stand if it was closer to closing time, but not at dinner time. If this is a lunch time only menu item, than the menu should state that. 
I originally came here because I heard they have corn, the lack of corn will keep me from coming back again."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken quesadilla because the picture on the menu looks delicious. What I got was a tortilla filled with green chiles and lettuce and a couple little bitty pieces of chicken. I thought they had made a mistake, so I brought it up to the manager, and told him about the problem. Even with this picture of a chicken quesadilla overflowing with chicken, he told me that my quesadilla was normal and he did not offer to remake the meal. That's just bad customer service so I asked for a refund. I live and work down the street from there but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Had one of the daughters and a couple of her friends in town so at my wife's suggestion, we headed back to America's for happy hour.  As I've said before, the best part of happy hour is that the tacos ($2) are only 50% more than they should be instead of the usual double. A decent street taco should be $1.25, $1.50 tops.
Once again, although the place was almost completely empty, it took about 25 minutes to get 2 tacos al pastor and a taco carne asada; once again the meat inside is chopped so fine as to be unrecognizable and consists entirely of charred exterior with no meaty interior.
My daughter, a lover of both sangria and margaritas, ordered a \"sangrita\".  Obviously not a popular drink as the staff had to look up how to make it and the result was awful.
To top off the experience, they have now have moved the happy hour singer indoors for summer and somehow found one ever more warbling and horrible than the previous one.
Simply put, we are done.  No more.  Los Taquitos is too close to put up with this crap."}
{"text":"I have been to America's Taco shop many many times! Food is GREAT, service is great, and fast. I have tried many different items on the menu and always been pleased. Every person that I have taken to America's.. it has become one of their favorite spots. Great for lunch or dinner.
Chips and salsa are very good, as well as the beans, carne asada, and pork! Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Should have checked reviews.  Worst burrito ever. Cold and tasteless.  Even the iced tea sucked.  Service wasn't much better"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy! 

Had heard about this place not only being delicious but that it was started by a woman who came her across the boarder as an immigrant. With all the hubbub about immigrants these days, its sad to say that this place (amongst many others) wouldn't be here if it weren't for the blessed peeps who come over here and share not only their love but food and culture with all of us gringos who don't got nothing! I love the patio, I'm just missing the beach in front of me (instead of 7th street), especially because I've got a negro modelo in my hand, munching on some chips and (AWESOME) salsa. 

I ordered a carne asada taco and one cob of America's corn. Both were delicious! Although I was stuffed with it all, I think I could eat at least two tacos, they're pretty cute and small. The corn was amazing and the sauce the came with it was kind of sweet at first but by then end my mouth was on fire (in a good way). I LOVED IT! Jose got the quesadilla with carne. It was also delicious but small for $6. That was his problem \"I paid $6 for that small thing, I could make it at home\". Which, yes, is true but you didn't and its yummy.  

The staff we're friendly and genuinely nice. Great music was on the speakers and it was extremely clean. Everything taste and smelled fresh and it just felt very comfortable.

Saturdays & Sundays they have $2 pacificos, ALL DAY! I've got a girlfriend coming into town in a couple of weeks, I guess I know where we will be hangin out at.

Thanks America!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They don't comply with operation hours and choose to close whenever they want. It's 7:30pm on Monday, and Yelp has listed they should be open until 8pm. We roll up and the building is pitch black. 

What happened America's?! You used to be a really good spot. Now you've closed down locations and operate inconsistently."}
{"text":"Love this place! Really good, fresh, authentic \"fast\" Mexican food. It is not the usual \"bertos\" type Mexican food or Globe-style (cheese, sour cream, fried), which might explain the bad reviews here. But, if you like fresh sort-of-light Mexican food, this is one of the best options in the East Valley. We really love the salsa."}
{"text":"I live by the original America's and have been a faithful diner there for years. I was running errands today and finally decided to try one of the franchises. I apparently chose the worst facsimile.

First, I noticed the guy who had ordered after us got a triple taco plate and a burrito. He seemed confused and told the cashier, \"no, that's okay.\" the cashier then delivered my husband and me one plate of triple tacos, despite the fact that I had also ordered a burrito. Fine so they mixed up the order and I had to wait.

When I finally received my char broiled chicken burrito, it tasted like I had left over holiday turkey and tried to make a burrito out of it. Though I couldn't quite put my finger on it, it did not taste like Mexican food. I had to pour a whole lot of Tapatio on every bite just to eat it.

If you want America's, go to the original 7th st location.the historic house is part of the charm and the food tastes authentic. If you're on 16th st. And camelback and you want quick food, go anywhere else."}
{"text":"First thing... the word Taco is in the name of this restaurant yet they offer 3 taco options, Chicken, Carne Asada and  Al Pastor. No fish or shrimp options, which is widely popular. I literally was the only one in this restaurant at 11:10 on a Monday. Mind you there are huge office buildings in the same parking lot and it was lunch time; that should have been my first indication. The tacos were bland and did not look appetizing but I was home now and on my lunch so I kinda had no choice. Not sure if it was lettuce or cabbage on the taco but it was too much and too chopped up. It was like mush. I will not return."}
{"text":"After calling several time and receiving no answer I decided to just drop by at about 6:00pm on a Tuesday and get some food but they were all out of chips and guacamole and there wasn't a soul in the whole restaurant and they didn't close for another 3 hours?!!"}
{"text":"Make sure you check your bag before you leave. They gave me someone else's order. Now I got stuff I didn't order and have what I didn't order. That's what he's append when you hire HS kids to run a place."}
{"text":"My favorite thing at Americas Taco Shop is the vampiro. It's like a meaty tostada and is muy bueno! The tortas here are also great; the bread is super soft and the carne asada is amazing. When I heard people talking about the corn on the cob I decided I had to try it. I was a little scared to try it since it had mayo all over it. I had nothing to be scared of- it was grilled deliciously with mayo, cojita cheese, chili and other spices. I do agree with other reviewers that the prices are a little high (really $2 for a can of coke?) but the food and the charm of America's Taco Shop will bring me back for lunch."}
{"text":"Need to change your recipes. We are big Mexican food enthusiasts and everything was tasteless. All tortillas were undercooked (raw), beans were watery. Salsa is too sweet. Learn how to cook some tortillas and use some spices."}
{"text":"Americas is a place that I had to visit more then once before I reviewed. 

It is good. The carne asada was tender and had a nice charred flavor. 

The bean and cheese burrito was good. 

The chips and salsa were bland, the salsa was \"tomato sauce\" as one of the 10 year kids said. 

The price was a little high esp $1.50 for each can of pop. That is $9 a six pack...."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment. Had el pastor tacos and chips and salsa.

Tacos I ended up throwing away meat was extremely dry. Chips seemed like a week old... Very stale

Stopped at Taco Bell to get tacos that tastes a lot better!"}
{"text":"Yelpers....you let me down. I expected greatness but what I got was just...ehhh OK. The place is cute, the story is fun and the beer is cheap (during happy hour) but the tacos and ceviche were small enough to be served at my neices tea party. Seriously.

I'd consider this more of a taco tapa's restaraunt than a true taco shop as everything (and I mean the 5 or so things are the menu) are a la carte. Did I mention that I hate places that charge extra for chips and salsa?"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because I love a good taco. I was disappointed and probably won't be back for three reasons: the food is way overpriced, the portions are too small and the food was just ok. I'll stick to Los Taquitos down the street."}
{"text":"The food is above average - maybe four stars. The location is good in the eclectic Melrose district - lots of interesting independent businesses. The ambiance is fun and feels like I'm sitting at a taco shop in Mexico. My only gripe is the price, America's could really be a four star joint but the price brings it down. Spending $20 or more at a taco shop for two people seems excessive. Maybe I'm comparing it a little too much to an authentic Mexican taco stand, but I just don't feel like I get my money's worth after I finish my food. I would definitely recommend it over many other taco shops; just be prepared to spend a little more."}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Mexican food I have had in Arizona (lived here for 27 years). The service was slow and unhelpful, the prices were way too high for the amount of food that you got, and to top it off they sent me home with the wrong order!! After calling the restaurant to share my frustration, all I got back was a \"oh, ok.\" No apologies and nothing to make up the 10 minute drive back. 

The food taste was below average as well. My carne asada burrito had almost no guac inside of it and the meat was burned to a char. I tasted nothing but tortilla and burned meat. An order of chips and guac will get you a handful of chips that would probably satisfy a 4 year old. Don't even get me started on the chicken quesadilla I ordered. There was no cheese in it!! huh!? Just chicken and bread with sprinkles of cheese. Unbelievable! 

After coming back to pick up the food that they had forgotten, I asked for some extra salsa. The worker at the counter hesitated and reluctantly handed me 1 small side salsa that is good enough for 3 chips. 

Let me sum up this entire review for you. Service is below average, the prices are way too high, and on top of it the food is horrible. Save yourself and go anywhere else for some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Wow...I've been coming to this location since I moved to DT Phoenix years ago and always had pleasant experiences, but the service has gone down hill.  I tried to order this evening over an hour before closing and was turned down for trying to pay cash.  Who turns you down for wanting to pay cash? Management really should plan ahead to sure they have change during business hours.  Sad to see a local favorite let themselves go.  :-( With so many choices on Phoenix I can't recommend them anymore."}
{"text":"American Taco!
Please come to meee!
American Taco!
Papas let me bee!
Don't come hangin around my plate
I wanna see you in my belly not my face!
(American Woman Lyrics)

America's Taco Shop is actually named after a woman named America; not our country America.  America Corrales and her husband created this popular chain restaurant in several states and luckily Phoenix was one of them.  Voted best Phoenix Mexican food by Phoenix Magazine in 2011, this Taco shop definitely has a reputation of providing some pop and zing!

I ordered the Al Pastor Vampiros while my sister ordered the Carne Asada burritos.  The vampiros were marinated in a sauce that reminded me of the Chinese BBQ pork, yeah pretty weird, but overall I didn't think it was the kind of vampiros I was thinking about.  I thought it filled my belly that's about it.  My sister really likes the food here and her burrito was very good in her opinion.  We ordered a side of chips and salsa along with our food.  I had to add some extra spice to get some kick in the salsa.  

America's Taco Shop is home cooked recipes at a fast food pace.  Thus, you ordered at the counter and the food is brought out.  You can also place your orders online, which I thought was pretty cool.  The place itself is a dive and diner feel with a modern gloss.  One thing brought to my mind; stainless steel.  Like a modern kitchen this place is covered with stainless steel!  

I would say overall experience of this place is good.  I didn't really love it, but I would definitely come back because of its unique twist to Mexican food that I'm usually accustomed to. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Craving for some tacos so we went to this America's Taco Shop the other day for lunch.  They have three locations now and they seem to be doing well since there were a lot of folks dining here when we arrived.  The restaurant is quaint, very clean and nicely decorated with a few TV's.  They have a very patio for dining with friends, whether permitting of course. 

Service ~ you walk in, up to the counter and place your order.  The folks working here are friendly and accommodating.  They do a lot of carry out in addition to their dine in. 

Food ~ We had their Carne Asada Tacos, Al Pastor Burritos, some shrimp ceviche since it was on a Saturday and their chips and salsa with guacamole.  The carne asada was diced rather than pulled so it had a different texture than what I am used to.  It tasted ok and with a little of their salsa and a lite squeeze on the lime my tacos went from ok to very good.  The al pastor buro had a good balance of spice with grilled pineapples and plenty of cilantro, lettuce and salsa, It was also ok to good.  The salsa and chips were really tasty but their guac was not something I would order again.  The shrimp ceviche was very disappointing since I'm a huge fan of ceviche.  Bits of diced cucumber, onion, tomato with diced shrimp?  It was more of a salsa with a little shrimp added.  The beer was excellent!!

They have a nice patio so it's a great place to dine for lunch or dinner next time you are craving some tacos!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, a great location & neat atmosphere. Sad to see that they took away the happy hour tacos. It kept us coming back again & again. Now it will just have to be a treat. Sad!!
Best bean burritos ever though :)"}
{"text":"I gotta say, I do not see where the rave reviews for ATS come from. I get the niche vegan group but, aside from the chain being named best carne asada by a local paper, I find the restaurant underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad -- the place is clean, has its own style, and has found success with shops all around town now. But I find the menu limited, the prices high, and the food just okay.

But when out of towners visit looking for the Best Mexican food, I steer elsewhere."}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop is the most consistently underwhelming establishment on Yelp. The food is good but doesn't make up for the portion sizes (too small) and service issues (typically with regard to preparing your order to match the receipt). For example, we were there last Sunday afternoon and there was only one other table in the restaurant yet the employee had to visit our table to confirm our drink order and, when dropping off our food, asked if we needed anything else and I had to point out the missing items. I at least understand that this stuff happens when places are in a rush; it boggles my mind that there is such little organization when the restaurant is slow.

America's has done an excellent job capitalizing on their early reputation. As they've expanded, however, I'm afraid to say that the overall experience that earned them this reputation has degraded considerably."}
{"text":"Guacamole was ridiculous (as in GOOD), as were the beans that came with. I had some kind of pineapple/peppers/chile rimmed margarita. It was eight dollars, which I wasn't too thrilled with, but aside from that I was pretty freaking happy.

I LOVE CHIPS!!! ;o)"}
{"text":"May I please have a breakfast burrito with a side of food poisoning! This would have be my second time visiting this place, and this will be my last. Here is a list of the food violations I saw. The cook wiped off the spatula he was using to cook my eggs with his dirty apron, grab a measuring cup out of the sink(obviously it had not been run through the dishwasher or sanitized in anyway shape or form) to measure the meat, high-five employees with his food handling gloves still on, fix his hair and pull up his pants with his gloves on, and then attempts to put my burrito together. At that point I requested a manager and she didn't seem bothered by the food safety violations that I saw. I guess it was the crews breakfast time because they were sitting down at one of the booths. When I asked for them to cancel my order and give me a refund, she was unapologetic and could care less that they were losing business. Filiberto's has better food handling qualities then this place. Lesson learned and I hope I save someone from cross-contamination or food poisoning. I work for a local company within the area and I posted on the internal intranet of my experience and will also be sending out an e-mail companywide to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Just was not a big fan. Wife and I tried the carne asada and al pastor burritos with a side of chips/salsa. Sadly, the chips and salsa were the only winners in our opinion. Both burritos lacked any solid flavor. With a price around $23, I would not give them another try."}
{"text":"To begin with, I ordered this for delivery and was not impressed with the GrubHub employee, who basically threw the bag at me.

If you're going to eat at the restaurant, the burrito was good. However, when I ordered a \"large\" I expected more than the skinny package I received. Also it wouldn't hurt to throw some chips in there would it?

The filling was absolutely delicious. The chicken and beans were fresh and there was just the right amount of salsa. However, like I said earlier, the size for the price was off-putting, as was the delivery guy's demeanor.

Next time, I will go to their in person restaurant and give them a try."}
{"text":"One of my absolute fave places to sit out on the patio and enjoy a cold bottle of Mexican coca cola and some carne asada! 

I've had the torta, I've had the tacos, I've had the pastor.  All of these are stellar!

This last time, I finally tried the Elote! A cob of sweet corn covered in crema and queso! I can't explain how delicious this is...it is beyond words!

Taco Tuesday is now Taco-Elote Tuesday!  

Never have I ever...been disappointed at America's!!!!"}
{"text":"Get the carne asada torta! It's just perfect! The telera bread (the traditional bread used to make a torta for those of you that don't know) is toasted to perfection!  For me, that is a must when having a torta!  Their carne asada is tender and flavorful and topped with jalapeños and avocado, lettuce and tomato. 

My friend ordered the carne asada tacos and to be honest, this was the quietest dinner we had shared in a long time.  The food was so good we forgot the other one was there!  

We ordered a side of refried beans that was the ideal size for sharing and they were creamy and super tasty.  

Do yourself a favor and order a horchata...but be warned, that when you order a large, it's not just any large....it's a L-A-R-G-E.  :-) 

Can't wait to go back and try some more items on their menu! :-)"}
{"text":"Their almost $10 burritos are the size of a taquito and taste horrible. The chicken is dry, the avocado is flavorless, and the salsa is watery. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"It wasn't good , but it wasn't bad... pretty bland. I feel like I paid too much for it. Clean place to eat , friendly employees."}
{"text":"I was glad to see an America's was moving into our neighborhood to take over the, at best so-so Baja Fresh location. Reasonably priced burritos, and usually quick service make for a nice quick mid week meal for my family. We returned from vacation pleased to see it had actually opened. I phoned in our order, arrived 15 minutes later, which was the specified time for it to be ready. I waited another 10 to 15 minutes for my order. With repeated apologies on the wait from the cashiers, I only hoped the order would be correct, and satisfactory. I was offered a free order of chips and salsa, an upgrade from medium to large on drinks, and an additional apology on the wait. To be perfectly honest, those acknowledgements went a long way for me. Once home, I not only found the correct order, but the quality was up to expectations as well. I can accept the wait as growing pains, will gladly return."}
{"text":"Not REAL mexican food! My friends and I stopped here for a quick bite before a spring training baseball game. If you are used to good \"taco shop\" mexican food, this place is not for you. Small servings and no flavor. This is coming from a group of San Diegans in our 30s. 

Thats all."}
{"text":"I feel that this is the worst taco place I have ever been to. I just started to yelp and I hate to give a store 2 stars after one visit, but my experience was horrific and a place like this should not be at a mall. The food was meh, it tasted kind of soapy and it took way to long to get my food. I had to go up to the guy who took my order and hes like oh shit man i forgot to put in the order I was helping out with something so when i asked for a refund he said that he would get it to me really quick and would throw in 2 tacos since i only ordered 2 tacos and chips. this place should be ashamed of the workers since they do not care what so ever they just want a check. will not be going bacl EVER."}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place but wasn't very impressed with the food.  I order a veggie quesadilla, guacamole and chips, and an horchata.  The quesadilla had soggy lettuce and onion inside and the horchata was too sweet.  It also cost a lot for a small portion of food.  It was fast and smelled amazing so maybe if you order a meat item it would be good.  Friends ordered taco's and said they were good but small.  What's interesting is that each meal comes with a radish, slice of lime and cucumber.  Might wait a while and give it another shot once it's settled in."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I spend almost $20 for two regular burritos and two drinks. The burrito was dry, cold,  and the tortilla was hard and flavorless. Trash cans full of trash made it impossible to use. I would never go again."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Mexican food. There are several locations around the Arizona valley, but the original in Phoenix is the best."}
{"text":"Skimpy tacos and only OK salsa, combined with the fact that an employee used the bathroom and resumed behind the counter without a hand-washing, made this the worst America's experience I have ever had. The only redeeming quality were the chips, until we got to the bottom of the basket and found a hair!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most authentic Mexican food in the Valley.  The carne assada was exceptional and we loved the guacamole.  If you have not tried this place you are missing out.  Once you eat here you will have a new favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the prices were ok. However, the eating area was crowded. The tables were crammed into a corner and most of the tables were filthy"}
{"text":"So good! We went here spur of the moment and got carne asada tacos and sweet corn and everything was amazing! from the service to the food, as well as the story that tells itself inside the restaurant. We love it!"}
{"text":"Stood at the counter to order for 10 minutes and ended up walking out. People waiting for their food. Was not crowded at all but the staff just was not interested in working."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food I really enjoy the bean and cheese burritos. They have good carne asada and el pastor as well. The breakfast burritos, ceviche and elote (corn on te cob) are also menu items to be enjoyed."}
{"text":"OK, for those of you who know me, you know that I'm forgetful.  When left unsupervised, as I was this weekend, I forgot to do somewhat important things (i.e. eat meals, shave, feed the fish...).  With that being said, on Saturday night after a day of working around the house, I realized that I was out of wine, and on my way to Safeway, I saw America's Taco shop was open.  I got a few bottles of wine for the night and went back down 7th, and got to America's seconds before 8pm.  Yes, they do close at 8pm on the weekends.  They gladly took my order and I sat and waited.  I always HATE being that guy who comes in right at close.  Thankfully, a couple came in close to 8:15 and they were just as nice to them as they were to me.  The owner/husband (I presume) came out and made small talk with me, and was very nice.
Anyways, I digress.  I got the Carne Burrito, and the flavor was amazing!  I asked for the Pico on the side and got a good size portion of it.  I will be going back for more!  I want to try everything on the menu like Dyl W did.  
If I don't forget to eat again today, I'm going to get the tacos."}
{"text":"How American are your tacos?  This place is pretty good ~ I like my tacos American please!

This place was a Papa Johns back in my prime days at ASU but they did a great job of redecorating to make the place seem less greasy.

For a first timer what are your safe bets?  I would recommend tacos or vampiros (basically a tostada) but would caution against the breakfast burritos, the one I had wasn't very memorable.   I do fancy the Cochata and anything with pastor (pork) in it.  I've also heard their ceviche is excellent but they only have it on Fridays!

THE MEAT:  The reddish pastor is very tender and has some sweetness to its flavor.  The carne asada (beef) in comparison is quite salty and is akin to cubed steak so they bits will get stuck in your teeth.  The garnishings they use are different depending on the meat you pick so be sure to try both before picking your poison.  They also seem to randomly give you guacamole, raddish, and/or cucumber as bonus sides; I'm still scratching my head as to the methodology and purpose here but I'm not complaining.

In the mood for a good taco?  America's Tacos is a great choice.    The benefits outweigh the negatives and I return here quite regularly!

Things I like:

-Outdoor patio very nice
-Food takes a little while to make, that's how you know it's good
-Pastor on everything
-Corn tortillas!
-Vampires (vampiro) ftw!
-Cochata will change your life
-Hit up their website for their story, it's always cool to read up about successful food establishments

Things I don't like:

-Don't let the menu fool you, it gets expensive fast and the portions are small so find some coupons. You're looking at about $10 for a man size lunch
-Their happy hour tacos are smaller than their regular tacos so double up
-Consistency is an issue, sometimes their pastor is excellent, sometimes it's a little tough or too salty for my preferences
-Location is a little weird if you're driving there"}
{"text":"Eh....food was good. 

I just don't understand how they have some nice locations, and then crap hole locations. By this time they should all have soda machines, and not be serving toilet/hose water to drink."}
{"text":"Great modern location! Of course the food is awesome. Not over the top spicy, and easy on the stomach. You won't feel disgusting after eating here.

SODA MACHINE, Unlike other locations. 

BEST GUACAMOLE!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, feels like this place has gone down hill. I saw a guy handle money, take out the trash and then grab my burrito to serve it to me. Quality of staff is a joke."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I love this place's breakfast burrito and their carne asada. For some reason, the first time I went to the 7th ST location, i didn't like it. However, I came back after about 6 months and now I am addicted!

I do prefer this location over the 7th street for some reason. This location seems to have a nicer staff. Plus it's close to some really awesome antique shops! Makes for a great pre-antiquing breakfast!"}
{"text":"Taco Tueaday... Cool, clean taco shop'ish atmosphere - good for those who are skittish of your typical taco 'slop shops'.  Had two Carne Asada, one chicken and one Al Pastor. Though all were fairly unremarkable the chicken and Carne Asada were by far my least favorite. Very bland. Bummed as a good buddy highly recommended. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is terrible. This is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location doesn't make the grade. Waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant at 1:30 for a bean burrito to go. Seriously..."}
{"text":"In town on vacation.  Great food and service.  We had the chicken burrito and al pastor vampiros! Delish. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"A few of us from work had talked about trying this restaurant and finally decided to do so.  At first it was the price that shocked us, but based on what we'd heard, we thought it would be worth it.  It really wasn't. 

The items we ordered were not at all correct (carne asada was missing from a carne asada quesadilla) and the size of the items we selected were not big at all.  The tacos were street-taco sized for the price of a standard taco and were so soggy (and cold) I had to eat it with a spoon.  

The flavor was definitely there.  Everything was very flavorful.  However, the service and the quality were not. 

Los Taquitos & Some Burro are both just on the other side of the freeway and so much better."}
{"text":"The food is as good as the Coronado location but the ambiance is seriously lacking. The inside had a funky smell so we opted for 100 degree heat and ate outside instead.
The main reason for three instead of four stars is that they screwed up our order. Not a huge offense, you say? Well they put their uber spicy jalepenos on my toddler's quesadilla instead of on my burrito. They replaced it but still... 
Bottom line: their food is good- love the carne and pork. We'll eat here again but I'll be double checking to make sure the order is right."}
{"text":"America...the beautiful. Ok...America the Delicious!

Ordered the al pastor burrito w/ spicy chips & salsa. Also got one of the corn on the cobs. 

It was fantastic, but the corn is really the only thing that I dream about. 

Several nights ago, I woke up in a cold sweat. Why? Well, it was because in that horrible nightmare, the only thing that happened on 12/21/12 was the end of corn...cornmageddon is what Conan O'Brien called it (Jay Leno quickly claimed the phrase as his own)...and since I'm a Cornhusker, it was a really traumatic vision, made worse that I knew deep down that I would never again have one of America's delicious, succulent cobs of heavenly goodness, those sweet sweet ears would be no more. *boo hoo* 

Today, I made a decision to sell everything I own and start stockpiling. We're only 2 months away from the end of the world as we know it, don't just sit there, do something about it. Go order the corn!"}
{"text":"I know this is their opening week and all but wow this was very, very disappointing. Went with my family and got food to go. Really expensive for the amount of food we got (about $40 bucks for 3 little burritos and a quesadilla). I had the carne asada burrito and it was overfilled with pico, zero meat. The tortilla was cold and the chips on the side were very stale. 

Not making a good impression for their opening week. Like I said, I understand it's their opening week, but you have to be more prepared. Cashier also was clueless when questions were asked. Perhaps they rushed to open the store because based on the staff and quality of food, it doesn't seem like their ready."}
{"text":"Had the carne Asada nachos.  It was bad.  The meat couldn't have been worse.  Pretty sure it was carne Asada beef anus.  Staff was friendly but skanky.  Clean up this place or it will go under."}
{"text":"They dont have sour cream. I just cannot give any mexican food place a fantastic review that doesn't have sour cream. Other than that, the food is good and its a nice quick lunch spot."}
{"text":"I was rather skeptical about this place upon arriving.  The menu is quite small, not leaving many options.  (Especially since I wasn't in the mood for Mexican - I was brought here by friends).  

I decided to go for the Pastor tacos, and placed my order.  They informed me that tacos were on special and that by ordering 1 more taco, I would actually be paying less.  I did, and got a carne asada taco as well.  They were freaking delicious!  We also got the ceviche and guacamole and salsa, all equally as good.  If you are looking for unique drink, try the cochata.  (horchata mixed with coffee)  it has quite an interesting texture, but was good.

It was a bit pricey, but I think if I had just stuck with the tacos, and skipped all the extras it would have been quite reasonable.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today.  This place is boarded up and closed.  Hopefully another Mexican restaurant will open here."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos and guacamole. Quick service and a nice patio to relax on. 
Great place for a quick relaxed meal."}
{"text":"Been here twice... don't know why I even came back they are over priced and  order has been wrong every time.... I can name you a handful of restaurants that have way better tacos for your money ..."}
{"text":"It's a shame that I kept driving past this place all these months.  Now maybe it was the traffic fairy that came along and caused quite the back up which made me a bit hangry.  

I stopped in parking lot and remembered that I heard this place was very good.  I was able to narrow it down to the taco trio or carne asada burrito.  The burrito made the cut and it was very yummy.  I am very picky about my burrito fixins and they do them just right.  Not too much, not too little, and lots of flavor.

Don't be like me and keep passing this place up because it worth the stop."}
{"text":"I've seen this place before in Tempe so I was dying to give it a try....oh no, now I have another fast food guilty pleasure :)   Me and my friend both thought the guac was amazing and couldn't stop eating it.. one of the workers even brought us extra chips free of charge and refilled our drinks (did I mention this is a fast food restaurant?).  I had the carne asada torte and it was sooo good.. I keep dreaming about it.. I'll have to go back sooner then later..like tomorrow."}
{"text":"I had been watching this place since before they opened. I never saw any cars and thought it would not last the month. Then I noticed that the porch was full of people having lunch. The parking is in the back. I am glad I took a chance on it. America is a person and her Taco Shop is divine. It is a Mexican version of the Coronado Cafe. They have a limited menu around 10 entrees, but they are awesome. I had the Quesadilla De Carne Asada for $4.50, some chips and yummy Salsa, as well as some of the best Flan I have had and a Mexican Coke (the beverage). The counter help was attractive and efficient and I had food within minutes. I devoured it and could have eaten another Quesadilla, but I am a big eater. I liked the crowd too. Give it a shot before people find out about this place and you can't get a table."}
{"text":"Went there on 4/10 at 6:15pm and our first clue should have been...we were the only ones there smack in the middle of dinner hour.  But, because we have had amazing food at the one that used to be at University and Rural, we took our chances.  

We were semi-greeted by a young man...he was the only one there unless someone else was hiding in the back and they never came out in the 45 minutes we were there.  He seemed surprised as we entered the door...no hello, no welcome, just stood at the cash register.  I said hello, to which I got a semi-smile.  My partner asked him if he was ok and his reply?  \"I'm really tired\".  Ok then...

We ordered, me the three carne taco plate and she the three mixed taco plate.  We paid, no verbal nothing from the young man other than repeating the cost.  We paid and he went to work making our food.  First came chips and salsa, which we ate while he prepared the tacos.  Not a word from that young man and again...there was only the three of us in the whole place.

Taco plates came out and I noticed that mine had whole beans.  I apologized saying that I didn't realize that there weren't refried beans to which he said, \"oh you wanted refried?\"  Well yes and actually, it would have been good for your to ask my preference but ok, I didn't specify so I'll take responsibility.  He took the plate back and switched out the beans.  

Overall, the food was ok.  Not hot, semi-warm.  Definitely not what we remembered from eating at the other one in Tempe.  Won't be back, at least to this location.  Our $21 can be spent on much better tacos at locations all over Chandler!"}
{"text":"We were there for our monthly Smunch.  Only about half the folks who said they were coming showed up.  Their bad.  Somehow the restaurant had started following Smunch on Twitter so they knew we were coming.  They didn't know all the adults there were also Yelpers.  I think the front of the house was over staffed for anything less than a full house, which it never came close to.

Never having been to another America's location I had nothing to compare it too.  Two of our party are regulars at the 7th St and 7th Ave locations.  All of us liked the food and the service.  Fast casual is not a place I would normally tip but the service throughout was good enough all of us tipped on the way out.  I had the taco trio and a Cochata.  Very good stuff.  If you go in and start moving tables around for a group they will actually bring out larger chip bowls and a large serving of each of the 3 dips for the table to share rather than the small serving with one salsa that normally comes with an entree.  I am pretty sure we decided in order that the guacamole, then the spicier salsa then the mild salsa.  In fact the mild hardly got touched.

So maybe it is only a 3-1/2 but it was so much better than the previous reviews had led us to believe that I rounded up instead of down this time."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, affordable rates and great food. We had beans, guac, chips and salsa, pineapple and mango margarita and almost one of everything on the menu in our large group. LOVE that you do happy hour on Saturday- made our dinner for ten so reasonable!  Have to say a highlight of the experience was the very nice, blond server, Belinda? You made us feel at home - didn't feel like the typical counter experience and the family had a lot of fun with your help. Thanks for a fun start to our night! 


Note: Map in Yelp is way off so use another app to get here."}
{"text":"Was at Arizona Mills Mall headed to the movies and walked past the food court and saw that  America's Taco Shop was there, this is a place that I have been wanting to try, not necessarily in the mall, but just in general so I took the chance and headed over before the movie.

 After studying the menu I went ahead and ordered the Carne Asada Burrito, which had caramelized onions, pico de gallo, carne asada and asked for the extra spicy hot sauce to go with it.

I want to say the burrito was mind blowing, but it was bland to me, it had a great opportunity to be a mouthwatering experience, but it wasn't, I was kind of of looking forward to the caramelized onions, but really they were just like slightly sautéed and its kinda like being invited over to a friend's house for fajitas and finding out that they used the frozen onions & bell pepper mix for it. It just wasn't as good as I had hoped it to be, but for a fast lunch time meal it would be something to check out, not something for a dinner, for dinner I just want more flavor."}
{"text":"Outstanding burritos! Just happened upon America's Taco Place when on our way to Butterfly Wonderland (2 minutes away). Sure glad we did. Restaurant is super clean and modern, and staff were very friendly. The food was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I'm loving the Cochata so much that I swung by twice this past weekend. Whoever came up with this coffee and horchata concoction is a genius.

Now I only wish America offered a soyrizo breakfast burrito. Will you please do this for me and all the soyrizo lovers in the Melrose? 

Thanks in advance."}
{"text":"I eat at Americas Taco shop at least one a week and always get breakfast burritos on the weekends.

My favorite things to get from here are the chorizo burrito as well as the carne asada. 

The only thing I have to say bad about this place is the service, it honestly just depends on what day you go and who is working. Sometimes they will be nice and sometimes they wont even speak to you. I really enjoy this place and am a loyal customer, I just which that they would provide better customer service. It seems like everytime I go in there they look miserable."}
{"text":"Pros: Really cool Soda machine. Very friendly people. 

Cons: Have yet to get my order correct. Just one request, no caramelized onions."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the place other than it is cute.  But that doesn't make the food taste better.

No chicken on the menu,  Weird.

The tacos are so/so, I can get the same, cheaper, at Flilbertos.

Was excited for a new place in my hood but it's not worth the price or going back."}
{"text":"Congratulations, this might be one of the worst taco shops I've ever been in my life. The tacos al pastor were way too dry, no flavor, felt like grandmas over cooked pork chops attempting to be a taco. I wish I could've read this before I ordered my food. Overpriced. I need players were not very \"friendly\" either."}
{"text":"Meh.

That's about it.

The menu is small, but I guess that's because they are centered around their \"awesome carne asada.\" It's nothing special. The corn was good, though.

Not worth about a 25 minute wait for takeout. I'll stick with La Tolteca, MMMMM!"}
{"text":"What is it with thin, almost meatless burritos in this valley? Attending a meeting nearby I caught this place on a drive-by and decided to try it. I was thrilled to find an Al Pastor option! ...except when the burrito arrived I had to hunt and dig to find the Al Pastor. It was all tortilla and some sort of green veggie mixture.  I would love to say that the Al Pastor made up for it but I could barely taste any... The accompanying salsa was sweet... yuck!

You'd think a burrito place near the University would be a slam dunk, but I don't even think a strong case of the late night munchies would find this place even remotely satisfying. Bleh!"}
{"text":"With a name like America's Taco Shop, I had to check the place out.  

Got the \"homemade\" ceviche and the carne asada taco.  Thought the prices were a bit high for the quality and amount of food that I received.

The ceviche and tortilla chips that came with it were a bit bland.  The carne asada taco was good but not spectacular.

What got me though as I sat indoors in their dining room was I started to notice how dusty everything was.  There was a grimy layer of dust over all the decorations on the walls and the tops of the condiment bottles were frankly disgusting like they had not been wiped in ages.

So I decided to check out their bathroom.  Sure enough, the ladder they had leaning against the wall had a layer of dust on them . . . . 

and I felt a little grossed out . . . let's just say, if the public areas like the dining area and bathroom are not clean and well care for, I don't really want to imagine the condition in the kitchen . . ."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at a co-worker's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised.  Always love when you find a place after absolutely no expectations or preconceived notions.

The menu is as small as the place and pretty much rotates a couple of proteins (carne asada or pastor) within a few formats, and that's it.  Who am I to suggest messing with success - the food was freshly prepared, flavorful and fast.  I had the carne asada quesadilla and a basket of chips and guacamole - $15 (!) but the amount was enough for two to share, so not that big of a deal there.  The quesadilla was unlike one that I'd had before, with finely shredded lettuce, onion and caramelized onions in the interior - a novel concept for me, but a good idea in terms of letting the carne asada steal the show.  Moist and well-seasoned - it provided a moment of taste-bud joy.

Can't give 5 stars only because a) I was not so bowled over by the food that I'd make a special trip here and b) the smell of ceviche almost knocked me down the moment that I set foot in the place.  Don't get me wrong - I love ceviche.  I just don't want the smell of seafood dripping from my pores while I'm eating.  Thank god they have an outdoor patio to eat at.

I'm not at all ambivalent about this place, though - will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that really is unique. The al pastor here is great and I love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"i thought this place was great i loved the bean and cheese and the chips and salsa was addicting but it was a little to much for how small the portion size was"}
{"text":"The place is super clean which led me to giving it three stars.  The food for this price point is really no big deal.  The carne a safe burrito had ok flavor but size was about half of what you get anywhere else comparable.  They do have the multi coke flavor machine which is nice, but nothing here would keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I think America Corrales needs to re-engage in her namesake restaurants. The food and service DO NOT represent her \"precious possession of her mothers hand-written recipes\". The best and only thing we would order, the torta and elote, aren't even on the menu. And the staff could careless what the menu offers and how it tastes. There is nothing authentic or mother-recipe about t and should be re-named Taco Bell."}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop make some of the best meat available at a mexican food restaurant... Having said that, with the surprisingly small the portions combined with how steep the prices are, it's better to go somewhere else.

My burrito was about as thick as a broom handle and my wife's quesadilla had almost no cheese at all in it. Spent too much for not enough!"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst Mexican food I've ever had in Arizona. We walked in and ordered two burritos to go, one of them was just a simple bean and cheese. It took 45 minutes to get our food and the staff didn't seem apologetic at all. To make matters worse once we got home and took our first bite I was not impressed. Overall it was edible, but not good at all. Just to go filibertos..."}
{"text":"Yay, even though I miss living in Coronado I am glad to be back at the Melrose America's.  If you have read any of my reviews you know how disappointed I was with Coronado America's rude service that I boycotted that particular location.  

Now that I am back around Melrose I can once again enjoy Happy Hour Tacos and drinks, or their delicious breakfast burro and cochata.  If 7th St let you down try 7th Ave."}
{"text":"We used to live in the Melrose District off of 7th Ave and must be spoiled from 7th Ave's America's service.  7th St has only treated us right the first time we came in.  Since then there have been no greetings, just a long wait and \"will this be for here or to go?\"

This review has been a long time coming, with the hopes that service would improve, it has not.  One Sunday I waited 20 minutes for 2 breakfast burritos, mind you it was breakfast time and I was the second customer in line.  The only thing good about America's on 7th St is the food.  I would much rather ride my bike to 7th St, but will instead drive to 7th Ave for your food based on service alone.  I love the story behind America's and your product, but just because you have a strong following doesn't mean that service should not be present."}
{"text":"Blonde girl working the front has little to no social or customer service skills. I order my burrito then try to order a water cup and got cut off about 3 times. It was 8:30 so I guess she really wanted to get home to watch game of thrones. Then she proceeded to ask me 3 additional times if my name was really Morgan. I'm a guy by the way so I'm guessing this was blowing her mind harder than my water cup order. Foods delicious, I just think they could walk left or right for a couple minutes and find a more competent cashier. I'll stick to Los Favoritos and Tacos N More from now on."}
{"text":"We were in downtown Scottsdale to see one of the last shows at the Camelview 5, so sad that it's closing, and decided we wanted to try somewhere new for lunch after the movie. Two choices came to mind: America's Taco Shop and Cornish Pasty. My partner and I went back and forth but settled on America's Taco Shop.

As we walked up to the entrance I had the ah hah moment that I'd already tried there tacos at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport...and wasn't impressed. After all the back and forth and because this was their original location I decided to give it another try. In my opinion, don't bother.

The tacos were flavorless, beans and rice were cold. The chips and salsa were the highlight of the meal that cost $25. That's too expensive for street tacos."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place because my brother in law and sister in law kept telling us how much they love it.  It is a small little house with a patio out front, which was perfect for the great weather the other day.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito and a carne asada taco.  I am a self described burrito expert, and this burrito was a winner.  The tortilla was soft and flavorful, and the beans, which are not made with lard, were nicely mixed with cheese.  The taco was very good as well.
  Like a good yelper, I checked in to this place when I got there.  There is a check-in offer for free chips and salsa.  When I showed it to the employee, she said I had to print it out in order to get the deal.  I told her that you can't print check-in offers; that they are meant to be used on your mobile device.  She pretty much told me that she wouldn't honor it.  Apparently the manager has not told anyone who works there about the check-in offer and how to use it, because she acted like I was a jerk for even asking about it.  She ended up giving us the free chips and salsa, but I could tell she thought she may get in trouble for giving it to me.  That manager should probably explain the check in offer so this doesn't keep happening.  Aside from that situation, the food was great, and I would definitely go back for more of those yummy beans!"}
{"text":"Lovely carne asada. I go for the breakfast carne asade burrito most often, as it has more of a kick to it than the regular. Close to ASU Tempe campus. Friendly people, who remember regulars!"}
{"text":"Best Carne Asada burritos in the state and I consider myself a Mexican food expert ;)... any way try this place out, make sure you get a burritos the first time you go here, not a taco."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly. Their beans are perfection. The Mango Habenero margarita is to die for!"}
{"text":"I love Mexican food. Let's just get that out there..it's delicious and I love their use of spices along with fresh meat and veggies. I just had to try this joint out while here in town with a friend. I liked the feel this place had. It was simple and all about the food. It was laid back with a few spots inside and more outside...And the food was oh so delicious!!! I decided to go with the carne asada burrito, while my friend went with the carne asada torta and we added some horchata. We got the horchata and water and sat down in one of three seating spots. There are more outside but it's July and it's hot despite the misters. 

We both really liked the horchata. I love horchata and this had a great taste to it. A definite must for a hot summer day. Our food came quick and it was succulent and fresh and whooooaaaaa..It was delicious. There was such a great texture to the carne asada burrito and it didn't fill me up. Unlike other Mexican joints that load up on cheese, this place doesn't which means you get to focus on the flavor and the meat not the cheese and I'm ok with this. I was very impressed and wish they could send me their recipes so I can repeat them in Indy!!"}
{"text":"Super good food. It has a true mexican flavor. perfect for my bean burrito & taco taste!"}
{"text":"I guess i may have to try this place again, based on the reviews, because I really just didn't feel like it was all that great.

I tried the \"large\" carne asade burrito, and like 3 tacos.  The tacos were tasty enough, but nothing I feel like I have to go back and try again.  The carne asade taco is what really disappointed me.  The meat was great; it was juicy, and very tasty, but the burrito was TINY considering it was called a XL or large or something like that.  

The meal did come with complimentary chips and salsa, but based all the other great cheap Mexican food places here in the Valley, I doubt i'll run back any time too soon.  

I will return simply to see if my first experience was just a fluke, but being someone who loves Mexican food, for me it's typically love at first experience, and while this place was good, I just didn't feel the need to return afterward."}
{"text":"Very good tacos, quesadillas, and burritos! The patio has misters that keep it a nice temperature. From what I have heard this is the only Americas taco shop that is worth going to."}
{"text":"All I know is that they make the best al pastor burritos and tacos in Phoenix. They are just sweet enough, just savory enough and I always want 50 more of them. 

When it's sunny and not smoldering hot outside, the picnic tables out front are a great place to have lunch. Parking can get to be tricky when it's busy but you can go next door and thrift shop it up while you wait for your food to be ready."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just real Mexican tacos. Everything fresh and tasty. They include a variety of salsas too. I like the Al Pastor the best but you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed even though I've driven past it a ton of times. It didn't really catch my attention. When my husband suggested we go there, I said \"Huh? Where?\" Been there once, definitely crave it again.

The carne asada burrito was delicious, and it was the perfect serving size. I was able to eat it all but I wasn't left hungry or unsatisfied either. They could definitely use some help in the service/usability department though. When I first walked in, I had no idea where the menu was (it's written in chalk on the walls in very large print...so large I didn't even think to look at it as a menu). 

Mmmm...I want a burrito now."}
{"text":"They claim to have the best carne asada in Phoenix, but it's the best I've tasted anywhere...including Mexico."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times due to working nearby.

Few consistent issues:
-order is never ready at the time requested
-order needs to be double checked frequently because have forgotten add on's that were purchased.

With the first issue, my one concern is that we have a short work lunch, and it is so convenient to be able to pick up food at a specific time.  It is not ready though when we show up, regardless if you placed it with 30 min for them to prep.

Multiple times as well the guacamole has been left out of the order.  No time to head back on my lunch, have called for the refund to be issued a few times and never was.  No use in wasting my time over a few bucks, but it would be nice to know they would at least attempt to make it right next time.

Take it as the warning it is, there is always a reason that place is empty."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.... Since I saw good reviews and a friend was raving about a new taco shop and I was psyched since it was close to home. 

We ordered 2 tacos each and 2 cheese quesidillas, and 2 small sodas...seems like a lot of food, especially since it was $26bucks. WRONG!  

They are nothing more then small mexican street tacos, not much flavor in carne asada, nor do they give you enough meat however they are generous with shredded lettuce, isn't that great. ..oh and a knife spread of guacamole.  Eh! 

They have coke which is always a thumbs up....The manager was attempting to fix the soda machine which took15 min to figure out why the machine wasnt calibrating correctly....kinda sucked eating mexican food with nothing to wash it down with til after I was done eating...I get it, it happens but how about offer water maybe. 

In conclusion,  if this place was priced according to the size of their food it would probably give them another star but I really wasnt impressed  with the lack of flavor or experience so chances are we won't go back..better off saving your money and hit up a cart on AZ Ave for some authentic mexican street tacos"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe how bad my first review was! i'm glad I went through to read my past reviews, because this one was way off. Maybe it was my secret plan to keep people from crowding our spot!

We bring everyone here! The tortillas are great, the service is amazing, and I've never had anyone tell me they didn't love it. Their cochata is amazing, and my personal favorite is the vegetarian quesadilla. yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best fast-food taco places I've experienced in awhile. I love the steak tacos with fresh guacamole and fresh pico de gallo. And their chicken burritos are amazing and packed with meat. Their salsa that comes with the chips is the best salsa I've ever had. I actually had my husband buy salsa only so I could have it at home for a snack lol. It is that good!!! Service is ok.. other than that the restaurant is very clean and parking can be a bit tight."}
{"text":"Cute neighborhood spot. Authentic, tasty food. Walk from Old Town. Seems more local though.

I had El Pastor burrito. Hubby had tacos.  Side of guac hit the spot! crispy fresh chips.

Indoor or casual patio dining.  Love the fountain and trees for shade.

Friendly staff, quick with food items."}
{"text":"When others say that this place has the best carne asada in town, they are not exaggerating. It is perfectly charred with a great flavor and the meat is neither too chewy nor too dry. The salsa, lime and radish that are served with every burrito complements the carne asada wonderfully. It really is a great burrito.

This review would have been four stars until they opened up their new location due to the difficult parking situation and long lunch lines. After opening up on 7th and Campbell, both locations always have people in them but they are never too crowded. 

Definitely a great place to grab a Pacifico, a burrito and chill on the patio under the misters."}
{"text":"So far, the ONLY thing I like about this place is the Cochata. Its a coffee, horchata mix - delicious!

The salsa leaves something to be desired. Its more lime than actual salsa...and salsa isn't blended into a thin pulp. They ask if I want spicy or not, of course spicy, but it had no spice to it whatsoever. I've had the carne asada and the pastor burrito, both are lacking in flavor. To little meat and way to much tortilla. Nothing else inside.

The service is...meh. No smiles, or greetings. Just a \"Can I take your order?\"

The parking isn't the greatest. You get 1 handicap, and 3 spaces - 1 of which is taken by the America's Taco shop van. The rest I guess is shared with the Antique store next door.

The only reason and the only thing I come here for is the Cochata, at just under 4 bucks, its a large iced drink and worth it. After trying the food here twice and both times disappointed, I don't bother with anything else."}
{"text":"A few colleagues at work told me about this place.  After hearing about it for several months, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  They have FREE WiFi here, which surprised me.  They also have patio seating and one of those new Coke machines that has a ton of flavors....the kind that you find in Five Guys Burgers.  I like those machines because you can get a variety of Coke Zero flavors.  I love Coke Zero, but it's damn hard to find in restaurants.

Some items I've sampled here:

Bean and Cheese Burrito, Regular $3.35

Carne Asada Burrito, Large $7.99

The Bean & Cheese Burrito is fantastic....easily one of the best I've ever had.  I think it's because they make it Lard-Free.  Also, the Cheese they put in the Burrito is addicting....I don't know what it is, but it's got me good.

The Al Pastor Burrito has a unique taste to it.  It's unlike any Al Pastor I've ever had.  It's a lot drier than I'm used to and it's kind of crunchy....I wonder if they grill or fry it before they put in in the Burrito?  It's definitely unique and good, but don't expect a traditional Al Pastor if you order it otherwise you might be disappointed.

The Carne Asada Burrito was just average to me.  I was expecting more from it, but it just didn't blow me away.  I might have to give it another try just to make sure, but I can't stop ordering the Bean & Cheese or Al Pastor Burritos, so I don't know if I will give it a 2nd chance....LOL

They have a variety of bottled Hot Sauce options on the table, but lack a Salsa bar....wish they had that.  The bottled Hot Sauce options are very good though.  The green stuff will kick your heiny, but is very good.

{"text":"Stopped by America's for 2 bean burritos to go: an XL America's and Terry's way; and a reg America's way, plus pineapple and no cheese.

First attempt: XL perfect but reg burrito has beans only. I'd just eat it, but it's like $1.50 to add anything on (which, btw, is nuts for like a tablespoon of diced jalapenos.)
Second attempt: guy at register is super nice, confirms order (America's way, pineapple, no cheese) before putting the order in again. Burrito has jalapenos and pineapple... and cheese.
Gave up.

I don't know, maybe just don't get food to go?

Total for 2 bean burritos (including tax/tip): $16 and change

Come on."}
{"text":"Very top notch experience here, so much so I'd even say it caught me a bit off guard. As a frequenter of many local Mexican food restaurants around the valley I've been accustomed to somewhat mediocre service followed up with a sub-par product. However, special thank yous go to Tonya, Daniela, and Tony (I am 99.9% sure those were the names) for making last night's dining experience one that felt above and beyond in comparison with it's many competitors and counterparts. Will be back soon, thank you again!!"}
{"text":"Went to Americas taco shop to pick up dinner for myself and some coworkers who had to stay late.  When I arrived, the cook appeared to have taken a few too many pain killers and was white as a ghost.  The cashier, whose name was Alex, could not be bothered to pay attention to our order as he was too busy explaining to another customer that they didn't have any steak for her order. I proceeded to order the carne asada nachos, no beans, sour cream or jalapenos, in addition to other food for my coworkers.  Verified my order on the screen was correct and paid for my food.  The first time that my food was brought out the meat was way under cooked, and had jalapenos, So I proceeded to ask for it to be recooked, well done.  The next time it was brought out the chips were soggy, there were beans (which I asked not to include) so I asked for my money to be refunded and my food to be cooked properly.  The cashier, Alex, proceeded to tell me I never asked for no beans, and huffed and puffed as he searched through the system to refund me.  He refunded me money for the tacos and nachos, even though nothing was wrong with the tacos and I never asked for this money back for the tacos.  Once he gave me my money back he began to walk away and I inquired as to whether or not they would be remaking the nachos.  He began to yell at me and say why would we remake something if I wasn't going to pay for it, and that if I wanted more food he was going to charge me.  I then asked to speak to a supervisor to which he yelled again, WHY? At this point I had lost my patience and began yelling in return.  Finally a very nice gentleman by the name of Brian came and addressed my concern, he offered to remake the food himself, and offered my coworkers some free food due to the inconvenience.  Overall I love this restaurant, but I will not return if Alex is working the register."}
{"text":"Caveat to my review: I have always been a burrito eater and only recently decided to start trying tacos. I had a carne asada taco and a pastor taco. The pastor was kind of barbecue-y and they also put some nice guac on the taco. They serve it with a side of light-colored salsa-- is it tomatillo? The entire thing was a multi-layered flavor treat. 

The carne asada taco was also pretty good, but maybe I'm just not a carne asada fan. I've tried a few of these tacos at different places and found the meat lacking distinctive flavor. I guess I'm wanting either smokiness, chile heat or some other spice to jazz up the steak meat. However, the steak was very tender and the tortillas are moist and have a nice, mild masa flavor. The salsa that comes alongside the tacos definitely helps bump them up a rung on the ratings scale. 

We had a side of chips and guac. which was very creamy and mild. Bean and cheese burrito my husband ordered was very, very creamy and had a wonderful pinto bean flavor. Beer was only $2.75 each for the imported bottles we got. The total bill was around $25. I consider that pretty standard for Scottsdale and Phoenix for casual lunch for two people. 

If you want super cheap, homogenized food, you should stick to Taco Bell. If you want GOOD, local restaurant food, go to America's Taco Shop. I will definitely be returning. I hope to try a burrito next time!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to americas for a while now and the last few visits there have lead me to change my rating of them. I really want to like coming here, their happy hour specials are great and they have a really good breakfast burrito. However, the counter service the last few times ive been in has been seriously dissapointing. Actually, they've been downright rude. There is no \"hello, how are you?\"when you arrive. Nothing. In fact, on our last visit,my husband and i were completely ignored while the girl behind the counter finished her conversation with one of the kitchen guys. i find this unacceptable. I refuse to frequent establishment  that obviously does not want me there. Well dont worry, i wont be returning."}
{"text":"Things I do not eat:  beef (and pig, however that is unrelated to this particular review).

Today I learned that if you do not eat beef, America's Taco Shop is not a good place for you.   I was caught off guard with the very limited menu containing only beef items.  The two non-beef options did not include chicken, which I found odd and irritating at the same time.  I went for the vegetarian quesadilla which was a huge disappointment.  It was lettuce, a little bit of cheese and guac in a tortilla and it was not in any stretch of imagination a delicious meal.  I had ordered chips and salsa as well, and I did find that the salsa was pretty tasty.  

It is in a cute house and the salsa is decent.  If you don't love the cow, I'd pass on America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"DANG. I'm not usually one to complain unless I'm really disappointed. What happened to America's Taco Shop? It used to be SO good! Granted I used to go to the one on 7th St.... And granted I always got the tacos.

1. I ordered an Al Pastor bowl today and paid .50 extra for sour cream. I got a drizzle. And I'm not exaggerating. I put more moisturizer or my face than this. 

2. The meat is chewy, gristly and not overly tasty. 

3. The whole bowl is nearly flavorless. I can taste the pineapple pieces they put on top, but not the guac, which was less than a drizzle, nor the spec of cilantro. The tiny vial of salsa could not even spice the bowl up. 

4. The passionfruit iced tea was the best part of the meal. 

$12 spent on the meal. Seriously disappointed. I ate about half of it and I'm not sure I'll even save the leftovers."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I had a torta. It wasn't bad...just okay. I'll probably go back sometime in the future"}
{"text":"The customer service at the counter should of made me leave. Eric was his name, between his grunts and head nods I finally got my order in. Horrible register service. Tacos \"chargrilled  chicken\"  were standard. No big flavor or anything exciting. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love the place.  The service is fantastic and fast. There is truth in the other reviews about portion size being small for the amount paid, but the food is delicious"}
{"text":"I've been going to their first location in phoenix for years and it was always amazing. Tempe location is like the evil step sister. Ive been to this location dozens of times and everytime was bad customer service. Everything from messing up orders (and not claiming fault!), burning food, and NO SMILES! They act like I'm an inconvenience every time. They never show appreciation to their customers. NO welcomes! NO thank yous! I wonder if anyone there has ever smiled. Today was the final straw. Breakfast burrito over cooked and they forget my salsa. The real ticker though was when she gave me my total, I passed her my money and she received a text....started to text back while I had my hand held out with the money. RUDE! Dlish is 1 mile away and waaaaaay better breakfast burrito plus they love their customers!!"}
{"text":"Best, best, best! My wife is from El Paso and we both love this place! Bean & Cheese Burrito is the best...pretty much everything is good here.  We really never get sick of it! The franchise one's aren't as good so try to go to this one or the one on 7th in PHX."}
{"text":"Great lunch place!  I am so happy I can order my lunch online and it's ready for pickup.  I tried the carne asada burrito today and it was delicious.  I will definitely be a repeat lunch customer."}

{"text":"03/07/2014

I went here, ordered a Mexican Coke, an al pastor taco, a carne asada taco and a shrimp ceviche.

My biggest complaint is the so-called guacamole. I read the story of America's mom on the menu. I'm convinced that she would be ashamed of the frozen \"guacamole\" chubs. ( a chub is a frozen pouch used in prepackaged food).

Yes, I saw the delivery guy bringing them in the front door. ( this us after I scraped it off my tacos)

The meat on the tacos was tasty, but not plentiful. It reminds of the 1990s and Tacos de Mexico - \"Home of the fifty cent taco.\"

For $2.39, it is very small. 

The shrimp ceviche was good. No complaints there.

The place is very clean and no complaints about the service.

I initially thought the name was in reference to over Americanization of the place. For a smaller chain it feels overly commercialized.

I don't know of any of these stores in the land I call home. 

I guess it's ok for fast food, but definitely do yourself a favor and skip the so-called guacamole if you order anything here.

BTW: I'm not a big eater, I'm a small guy. I spent $16.00 and left hungry. If you like a large meal, bring a big wallet."}
{"text":"The Cochata is amazing. I mean really, who wouldn't love coffee and horchata mixed together? Its crack in a cup, really. Or maybe I just really love both that much ;) I'm used to their other store that was on 7th Ave and Camelback and the University and Rural location, so walking into this place was kind of a shock- its clean, massive, and mainstream. The other locations were/ are hole-in-the-wall divey kinda places, but this store is N.I.C.E.

The food here is pretty good, the chicken quesadillas and tacos are my favorite along with the Al pastor vampiros when I'm looking to mix it up. The homemade agua frescas are always a good thirst quencher, but my favorite has to be the Jamaica (just go ahead and order the large). They are not overly sweet, but enough to where you don't need to add anything. The prices are more pricey than you are going to pay at a traditional taqueria for the food, but the quality of the product is top notch. I"}
{"text":"In line behind a gal that's picking up carry out, she got her stuff and another customer jumps in front to get her drinks and the guy behind the counter helps her and then he answers the phone and tells me that he'll be right with me... really?! 

I'm really hungry and not in the mood to be patient. Way to go ahead and take care of your phone orders first instead of the customer waiting directly in front of you. No thanks America's tacos I'm done.

I've tried their via Ventura location time and time again for breakfast pick up and they have never gotten my order correct and I've always had to wait once I got there for the order.  So \"no thank you\" I'll go back to eating at other small local businesses that seem to get it right time and again without a hitch."}
{"text":"So, yeah, it's really good Carna Asada, but don't forget the shrimp ceviche on Fri/Sat, as well.

I just had some for lunch (along with a couple of CA tacos) (great online ordering, btw) and I am seriously thinking about stopping by for happy hour on the way home so I can have some more along with an icy cold beer!  Mmmm, so good.

So glad they opened in Melrose!"}
{"text":"My entire family has become a fan of this place, and for the most part, I'm a fan as well.  The Carne torta is the best I've had in Phoenix, and the vampiro tacos are awfully pleasant and every satisfying.  They tend to have some fun stuff on the menu such as their shrimp ceviche or coffee/horchata mix, and they have some nice specials on weekends, and loads of Mexican beer (bleccch!) and o.k. margaritas.  They fall a bit flat on their side dishes, I certainly expected something better than what I got for \"America's Corn\"...not nearly as tasty as you would expect it to be.
Overall, 3.5 - 4 stars for the food.

They score 5 stars from me for the appearance of the place...the character and theme is decidedly local and doesn't feel overly contrived, which is the usual downfall for a place like this or a chain competitor (such as 2 - 2.5 star joints like Rubio's or Tacos Del Mar).  Solid four star service.

For a family of four, expect to drop 25-30$.  Not bad for some pretty good and relatively authentic tacos and burros...enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with my brother, and fellow reviewer, Ryan B. that the portions here are tiny. I ordered a $4 Vampiro, which was a flat, 1/2 taco shell covered in carne asada, cheese, and some green salsa. I didn't expect a full meal, but more that a half of a taco. I also ordered the ceviche, which is AWESOME! Served with a tiny potion of salsa, this ceviche is fresh and tasty! They only make it on Friday and Saturdays, which is why I only go to ATS on those days. Service is so-so. The staff doesn't look too thrilled to be there and have never been overly friendly. My biggest complaint is a can of soda is $1.50!! That is crazy! I am not a cheap person, but I really cannot stomach paying this much for a can of Diet Coke. I usually stop at a gas station on the way back to work to buy a soda because I cannot justify paying that much for a soda."}
{"text":"Went back today with the whole family....I have to suggest the al pastor vampiro!  It's like a tostada, but so much better!  The corn tortilla isn't fried, but it is crisp, light and not greasy.  A great option for those who like crunch.  My dad had the carne asada torta and was really happy.  He's not a big fan of tortillas, so the sandwich was the perfect choice for him.  He thought this was a great place because there are so many different options.  Definitely go for the carne asada or al pastor on anything!"}
{"text":"The carne asada was some of the best I have had, but a bit pricey for what you get. I opted for the carne asada quesidilla ( $4.95 ) it was basically a taco sized tortilla filled with meat, cheese, and avocado and folded in half. Great flavor and was very filling. I could see going back maybe their happy hour when they have some cheap tacos.

Employees that were there when I went, were not engaging at all and did not seem happy to be there at all. There was only one table occupied outside and all the other tables were dirty..there was a female that came out to clean finally but was moving sooooooo slow that we wiped off our own table and sat down, and she never uttered a word."}
{"text":"We like supporting the new local businesses...so here goes. Guess we're use to the giant sized Chipotle burritos, so the regular burritos were on the small size. The carne asada was overall pretty tasty. For a pretty limited menu, we waited awhile for the food. I kept thinking that they should offer a carne asada plate with rice and salsa. Maybe their upcoming new location on 7th Ave will have a bigger menu?!"}
{"text":"Customer service what friendly and helpful. The portions could have been a little bigger and the spicy salsa could have been \"spicy\". Over all it was a nice little place."}
{"text":"A co-worker suggested America's Taco Shop. And let's face it, everyone loves a taco!

The restaurant itself is cute. The back patio has a giant Jenga and other games. It has a small but cute interior as well. The parking availability is atrocious. Quite frankly, the fare isn't worth the frustration. 

The menu seemed good, with lots of options. I was excited to see elote. Of course, there wasn't any. I opted for the large al pastor quesadilla. For a large, it was sure small. There were three triangles. And the flavor was mediocre at best. I don't even think there was any pineapple in there. The Jamaica was good, but it tasted like the powder drink I get at Fili B's for WAY cheaper. Speaking of cost, this was overpriced to the max. What you get from a cheapie street vendor is a million times better. I won't likely be back to ATS."}
{"text":"What is this.....a taco for ants?!

I wish I could give this place a 5 star rating because boy do I love me some good Mexican food, but I just can't do it. 

Their tacos are like wee little babies and the chicken pieces are bite size, like safe enough for an infant with no teeth to eat. 

For the price def not worth it. I much prefer to throw down on some Wadda's tacos in old town where each bite is worth every penny. 

Now I will say-they are not lacking in the refried beans department. Not sure if crack is their secret ingredient but uhhh, I'm addicted. 
 
So if you go-order the beans and order ten tacos so it's basically like 3 normal tacos. But those beans doe. 

Oh and they don't serve alcohol anymore. Like what?"}
{"text":"Wow the carne asada burrito I had was great. It was also a plus that they had Mexicoke. The place was very clean and the customer service was great. I will be back."}
{"text":"YUCK!! This place is unsanitary and the employees are just plain rude. When went on a Wednesday night around 6pm and there where multiple filled trash bags next to the cashiers stand. Not to mention the amount of flies in the place!! The woman working even dropped our burrito while walking to the table and just put it back on the tray!! Save your money and get Mexican food somewhere else"}
{"text":"My buddy out of town Joe and I stopped in for a quick breakfast burrito. It turned out to be one of the greatest breakfasts experiences I have ever had.  Terry the owner is absolutely what a business owner should do.  He's educating us on his food and the Resturaunt's experience.  It's a must stop and eat!!!!"}
{"text":"The taco was the size of my palm... For being $2.39 I expected much more in quantity and in all honesty, flavor. 

The Carne asada burrito at $6 was also incredibly small in portion and although it had decent flavor the \"spicy\" version I ordered could maybe be considered spicy if it was your first introduction to spice but anyone wanting a bit of zing won't find it here. 

The chips and salsa was ok. The chips were decent but very thin so they broke fairly easily. The salsa was their mild version and in my opinion tasted like they just puréed tomatoes and that's about all. 

It was my first experience here and after reading how it was the highest rated in the valley I guess my expectations were too high. They gave me several small containers of various salsas. One was orange - no flavor. One was green - sweet and had a decent flavor if this is your type of salsa preference. The 'guacamole' they gave looked like it had been dispensed out of a toothpaste tube and tasted average at very best. 

The bottom line is the food was decent, not great. The prices were high in relation to quantity and flavor. If youre going to eat here go on the weekdays when the tacos are $1 not $2.39. 

If you are like me and tend to visit places around the valley that have been raved about and set a decently high expectation u will be let down. If u eat here out of convenience because of proximity to campus it's decent."}
{"text":"I was anti-America's for a while there. I had one bean burrito that just wasn't made quite right when they first opened in the Coronado neighborhood, and quite frankly slapped a \"Not worth it\" stamp on them and ignored the buzz.  I thought that their menu was too expensive for \"street food\" and ignored others when they raved! I also discovered La Condesa and was on that train full force forging ahead to salsa town. 

How was I to know that one day, mine and America's fates would change and we would be inextricably connected... When I started working at ASU, my coworkers recommended a trip to America's on University. Since I was new, I kept my bean burrito experience to myself and decided to give it another go. I got the carne asada tacos. I thought they were tender, spiced well, and delicious. I went again within a couple of weeks and tried the carne asada burrito (and even ordered a side of beans for chip dipping)... I was delighted. The burrito is so jam-packed with those complimenting flavors that I dream about it. I love their beans now too... Go figure. 

Oh America's... You changed my mind! Like a love I nearly lost, we learned from our humble beginnings and are happy together!

However, I miss your coupons that you offered for ASU-- and the green salsa is too sweet. Those are my only complaints. :) Hooray!"}
{"text":"What a great spot! Food was fresh, delicious, and service was super friendly. Sister and I loved the ceviche, chicken taco, and carne asada quesadilla. They have daily specials and prices were super reasonable. Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying America's Taco Shop, and found myself very underwhelmed. Never in my life have I paid $7.55 for 3 street tacos. To top it off they were the saddest, coldest, little Carne Asada tacos I've ever had. The place was pretty busy & pairing that observation with the steep prices, I assumed the food would be above average. HELL NO. I would rather eat Filibertos than America's Taco Shop. I also wish I took a photo of the embarrassing inside of my $2 cheese-less \"quesadilla.\" 

I guess one good thing I'll say, is, the restaurant was very clean."}
{"text":"bean and cheese burrito. oh my god. 

since i first discovered their bean and cheese burrito, i knew i was a fan of this restaurant for life.  i don't know how they get the beans and cheese to be so perfectly combined (they seem like they're whipped together), but it makes for an amazingly delicious burrito.  i come here almost every week because i'm constantly craving them-they're seriously that good. get it with avocado to make it even more tasty! 

ok-now that you know how obsessed i've become with this delicious creation-i can tell you about all the other things i love.  

COCHATA! 

holy crap! as someone who already loves horchata, i nearly lost my mind when i had this combination of horchata and coffee. i can get two of my fixes in a single drink and it tastes amazing.  

i'm also a huge fan of their carne asada burritos, the meat has an incredible flavor and is really tender.  the america's corn is also a favorite of mine; the flavors of the cotija cheese, lime, and chili go perfectly with the corn.

and they have mexican coke! how great is this place?"}
{"text":"I am done with this location. 

My carne asada burrito had a long black hair in it. Gross. So gross. 

Stick to the other locations when you need your burrito fix!"}
{"text":"LOVE it here.  Small, homey, and yummy food.  Great patio!  I love their veggie quesadilla and the beans are great.  It's nice to know they are lard free...which means you can eat vegetarian or vegan here easily!  The kid loves it...especially the beans.  They have jamaica, horchata and tamarindo fresh made to drink too.  YUM!"}
{"text":"VEGETARIAN beans...no lard. Try the vegetarian quesadilla...very good. They add and subtract and sub in ingredients in their menu with no complaint...so if you want to add onions and then make it Terry's way (hot sauce) with America's way (jalapenos) and then take off the meat, they'll do it.

CUSTOMIZE your burrito and make it just the way you want!"}

{"text":"We were floored when we saw America's at Arizona Mills.

{"text":"The owner has her picture on the wall about how her parents gave her the restaurant and now she is a successful corporate owner. The food tastes like its worst than kroger. It's definitely \"Americas\" taco shop because there is not one bit of Hispanic in the flavor of that food. I'm actually saying this, TacoBell is more Hispanic........"}
{"text":"It's my first visit here at America's Tacos Shop. I had these three top notch dishes of Carne Asado Tacos which probably the best thing here. Next time, I wanted to try their outdoor sit for new level of experience."}
{"text":"ATS is down to 3.5 stars now?  No way!  This place rocks.  My lady and I have a ritual of sorts now for this place.  I'm here pretty much every Sunday afternoon

The tortillas here are so fresh and delicious, probably my favorite.  This place is not your greasy Mex place, it is clean and well thought out.  The menu is small, but I never am craving anything they don't offer (i.e. everything they have is good).  I have tried a bunch of similarly priced mex places in the valley and ATS outdoes them all.  

You can spend more money to get a higher level of Mex, but at $3.25 for a bean and cheese burrito from heaven, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Call me when it's Mexico's Taco Shop.  

The food is fair, not great, but definitely not bad.  I've eaten there twice and while I can see some love it I just think there are far too many other options in town for fantastic Mexican food.  

The thing I find most disturbing is this margarita on tap trend that I keep seeing.  America's Taco Shop isn't the only place I've seen this.  Just the most recent.  It annoys me.  How tough is it to make a margarita?  

I'll likely be back and won't bitch about going but definitely won't be driving going past some of the other great taco places in the area to get to it."}
{"text":"The tacos are small and pricey it is not worth the money if it is your last $6 bucks it won't fill you up for anything .. I left the place as hungry as I went in . Got 2 tacos and a soda for $6.50 and it was on a Tuesday taco special. Total regret for lunch I probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for the type of food and atmosphere, but the food's okay. I've had better tacos and guacamole nearby for less money."}
{"text":"I don't know. I definitely have friends that would name their first born children America and Taco after this place but I just don't get it. It was ok. I got two tacos, one carne asada and one pastor. They were good. But that's it, they were good. They were also small. And they were also expensive. $2.50ish each and I definitely could have eaten 4 (and I'm not a big person)

It's just middle of the road to me, I'd never go out of my way to eat there but I'd never complain about going there if that's where my friends were headed either."}
{"text":"Went here today and got the charbroiled chicken burrito. On the menu it says there is pico and avocado/guacamole. All that was in there was chicken and that's it. Vey bland. I make better burritos than this!

It was busy as it was lunch time, but the girl behind the counter had a \"I have no idea what you're talking about\" look on her face when I placed my order. I don't know if it was too loud or if she just wasn't listening. 

3 hours later my stomach starts to hurt...you do the math. 

I'm not going back there. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Went in to pick up a menu........ No prices on it....no location addresses or phone number on it.  No prices on their website as well. Pease dont tell me prices fluctuate 
From town to town?????

UPDATE: 6/6/14. Just ate at Americas and they finally have menus with prices.
I had the carne asada burrito and my girlfriend had the taco trio.
The fruit on the tacos was a good addition but overall.....just ok.
The tortillas are the same as i buy from the supermarket and their guacamole.....well...it was bright neon green and smooth like soft  serve icecream.
Not sure if its made there or a buy out product. The latter i believe.
I believe the tortillas, chips and guac are all buy out products.
Once again.....ok at best"}
{"text":"This place is great the food is good, the place is very clean, and the employees are super nice! Shoutout to Stephanie and Belinda for the awesome customer service and making my visit exceptional! I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this taco shop in AZ! I lived very close so I went here more than three times a week. They serve very quick. Their Carne Asada burrito is Amazing. Tropical ice tea is my favorite and it's gone by the evening."}
{"text":"Ordered with postmates and found a hair in the quesadilla! It's definitely not my or my friends hair since my hair is blue and her hair is blonde. Definitely won't be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 2 stars but I really enjoyed my tacos. I got the taco trio and it sure is tastey! It came with an al pastor taco, chicken and carne asada. It came with salsa and a verde sauce. They are the size of street tacos and is the perfect meal. They have one of those cool Coke machines that have different flavors of every Coke product. I came here on a taco Tuesday and it wasn't too busy, which was awesome, for my one hour lunch! I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada burrito, it was really good. It was the perfect size for me, the meat was juicy and delish, tortilla was the perfect texture. People working there were very nice. I'll definitely be back for more.(:"}
{"text":"Food was decent. They've got daily specials. Today the regular sized al pastor burrito was $4.99. I got the Free chips and salsa for my yelp check in. I think the flavors in the burrito were good, the meat was cooked well. Maybe could've used more cilantro-but that's my preference. 

The salsa was not impressive to me, I'm seriously glad it was free. I wouldn't regretted paying a dollar LOL. Very watery tomato flavored stuff. Little pops of cilantro here and there were nice, but no depth of flavors. I got the hot salsa, and it was definitely hot, but hot has to pair with flavor I think.

I'd go back. Hubs might like it, he's really REALLY into burritos."}
{"text":"I really loved their bean and cheese burrito. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to both America's Tacos restaurants - one on 7th Avenue and one on 7th Street near my workplace.  The food was excellent on both occasions.  Perhaps a little pricey, but then again, I like good food and I will not lie...no other brother can deny.  Oops, sorry.  :)

Anyway, go here and you will not be disappointed.  Great outdoor patio seating and good food...the combo can't be beat."}

{"text":"I found it to be very mediocre and lacking in flavor which seems like an oxymoron for mexican food. I was riding by on my bike and was actually more intrigued by the $2 Modelo beer special and figured I would try the food, disappointing. Plenty of places in the area for cheap beer, just saying."}
{"text":"Great taco and burrito place.  Fun place to take the family and friends.  Can't wait to return to AZ to visit America's!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food in the valley is at America's Taco Shop. The prices are a little high, but it makes up for it in the great tasting food from original recipes. Great restaurant, and a must visit on \"Taco Tuesdays\""}
{"text":"I had placed an order today for a bean and cheese burrito with salsa on the side, and a large horchata. I waited maybe five minutes for my food? Not bad right? Well my burrito was pretty cold and my horchata was disgusting. I've never had such bad horchata in my life. I've been to so many of the different locations for americas taco shop and none are as bad as here there was maybe half an inch of thick almost paste like at the bottom of my cup that I couldn't even use my straw that low(and yes I did try mixing it) and no ice. I took a few drinks and had to throw it away. Overall I was very disappointed and wish I had just waited until I got home to eat."}
{"text":"I'm confused as to why these are considered \"the best\" carne asada in the valley? I've had some pretty amazing carne asada and this is just \"good\". No complaints on the meat flavour or texture, but the size of the burrito was a bit disappointing. The flavour was mostly the pico de gallo (which I specifically asked they not put in it). The guacamole was thin but had an ok flavour. It could have used cheese or sour creme to balance the onions and salsa better. I would have been less miffed about the pico being in there anyway if the place were busy but we were literally the only customers. 
Mother got the carne asada taco and a \"vampiro\" - something I'd never heard of before but seemed very Baja in nature with more sweet ingredients like pineapple. She liked them though commented the taste of the vampiro was odd (but not in a bad way - just a new kind of food).

Regular carne burrito, taco, vampiro, large lemonade, a can of Coke, and a side of chips with two salsas was just under $20. Didn't seem bad for all that but the portions are a bit smaller than I'm used to for a \"hole in the wall\" type Mexican food place - for that price at a place like Filiberto's, you'd get more food. I'm all for supporting local businesses though so I won't focus on the price.

Very nice outdoor patio area was perfect for a day like today.

Bottom line, it would have been 4 stars, perhaps, if my order was correct and the portions were just a bit larger. I'd still come back to try other menu items, especially during Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I'd been to the other location farther downtown and had been into this building when it was still Rubio's, so I thought I'd pop in and see the differences.
While the cashier was super nice and attentive, the food was way overpriced and they seemed to be out of a lot of menu items even though it was early evening on a work day. It's basically still a Rubio's with a different name and didn't seem as homey or \"local\" as the other location on 7th Ave. 
Wasn't impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito W/ Potatoes, verdict: For the price and quantity I think your ordinary or local taco stand would do you more justice.

The service is top-notch, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere and facility looks great. The food is delicious, and actually quite different from what I'm used to.

The price is fair, for the overall experience. But in the end, my stomach is the final judge. I guess I'm just used to being served in larger quantities, because I like the idea that I can eat half of my burrito and still have half for later.

This place is great if you want an awesome place to eat, friendly staff to interact with, and get great authentic flavors out of your food."}
{"text":"I love the Carne Asada burrito and tacos. Taco Tuesday they have a special on Pastor tacos. Quaint little place with indoor and patio seating. Beer, margaritas and true Mexican coke an sprite (made with cane sugar). They also have a happy hour specials every day from 2 to 6. 

I first visited the original taco shop on 7th street, and this one (their second) is just as good. 

Fast friendly service"}
{"text":"For 30 bucks u get about 6 tacos 2 drinks and some chips and salsa honestly you can go to a better mexican spot with better tacos cheeper"}
{"text":"I should have known something was amiss when I walked in at 12:30 on a Saturday and there wasn't a single customer. And then I noticed the menu had completely changed. Had I have known they had sold out and basically become a Baja Fresh I would have gone elsewhere. They didn't have any aguas frescas. They hadn't even started making them yet. The Carne Asada taco I had was low quality compared to what it used to be. The bean burrito however was excellent and didn't disappoint, thus the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. So glad its right by me.

The staff is always super friendly, it's never packed, and like the other locations, the food is amazing.

I always get the carne asada quesadilla. My hubby, the carne asada tacos *plain* on flour tortillas (he's very picky and theyre very accommadating).

Oh and did I mention that their guac is like crack?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for such a tiny tiny place and the staff is always pleasant , even when theyre slammed.

And the food: SO GOOD.

My personal faves include the carne asada quesadilla, chips and salsa, carne asada tacos, an orange soda in a bottle, and the holy grail: their guacamole. Now, youll have to try theirs to truely understand, but their guacamole is like crack. Seriously. Its SO good. To the point that youll start eating it and will not be able to stop. And they put it (and caramelized onions) on practically everything.

 Crackamole. Go."}
{"text":"Ordered two \"large\" (XL) carne asada burritos ($18.)
Felt like half my burrito was missing as every bite was filled with mostly tortilla. Food was alright but portion sizes don't match up to descriptions and pricing. I should have read the previous reviews before going here as I would have realized this is a reoccurring problem. You pay the same price as you would at chipotle for a burrito but you get half the food."}
{"text":"Not only is the carne asada amazing their refried beans are perfect.  I am sure they loaded with fat, but they taste great and their bean and cheese burrito is super tasty.  We usually get it togo, but if you stay to eat they only have cans or bottles for beverages so beware."}
{"text":"So sad!! Food was cold and not well seasoned unlike the original location. The cook got upset that I nicely asked to get fresh tortilla because it wasn't warm. The other staff were nice. The only thing this place has going for them is there bottled coke! Sucks such a great rep the original place has and this location just ruined it for them!"}
{"text":"Ok, Ok... I'm a total fan of the staff! Well yes, speaking spanish with mexicans can be fun, and it brings a plus when you order :).

Despite I'm a very picky person in terms of tacos or mexican food in general, I actually liked this place. Still this is a bit of Sinaloa's style and you still are missing the REAL flavor of tacos. Ooook! granted! I guess I'll never ever find the real mexican taco flavor in this land, but if you want to try something very close to it and can't afford to go to a Tianguis in any Mexican city (Mexico D.F., Guadalajara, Puebla, etc., etc....) this is a good way to start. 

The day I went their selection of beers was VERY limited. SKIP TECATE if you appreciate your taste buds please!. 

Their happy hour, sure can make you happy! Tip the personal and be a happy customer!!"}
{"text":"The Breakfast Barito needs to have Real eggs in it at $10+ for chips,real Mexico coke. Sad"}
{"text":"Nothing like the original americas. They franchised, and it shows. Pretty much sucks now. Poor customer Service. Small portions high prices especially for the chips and salsa. The amount of salsa they give you is a complete joke. I'm just going to stick with chipotle"}
{"text":"We had bad experience. The burritos were cold on the inside and the soda machine was not calibrated correctly. I would skip this one."}
{"text":"O M G...Phoenix has a rockin' new taco shop and it's only a short walk from a METRO stop.  

America's Taco Shop has a kick-ass family recipe for carne asada that's SO good, you wish a bowl for free feeding could be at your work desk at all times. My friend and I both had the carne asada burrito (pictured below, sorry for bite, couldn't wait) and after the first bite, in stereo, we both said 'OMG, that is so good'. 

Why does it sound like LC from 'The Hills' is the guest author in this post??? 

Anyway, the best part about all this it's a local family owned business, it's a great place with delicious food near the light rail, and it's reasonably priced. America's Taco Shop 2041 N 7th St (across from Coco's) 602.682.5627"}
{"text":"This was my first experience at an America's Taco Shop and it was just okay. The service was very good from start to finish but the food we ordered was nothing I would go out of my way to go back for.

I ordered a chorizo and egg burrito which was really just okay. My fiancé had a bean and cheese burrito with a chicken taco and again it was just okay. He said that the chicken taco was probably the best thing out of everything. We also ordered chips and salsa which were very disappointing. We ordered the spicy salsa which was not at all spicy and very salty. The chips were not warm and tasted very generic. I could have definitely had better chips and salsa at home any day, would not ever order these here again. The habanero hot sauces were the only thing that saved the salsa in this case. The chorizo in my burrito had an okay flavor but I mostly found myself eating around it and eating the bean and cheese half of the burrito. Apparently America's Taco Shop is known for their carne asada which we were told later but I did not get the memo. I might come back to try the carne asada but I would rather go to Espo's or even Rubio's over ATS.

I am just not feeling this chain. It may be great for others but this isn't my spot. I would rather take my $17 for two combo meals and drinks elsewhere. Return factor 30%"}
{"text":"I liked it. The reviews scared me but they delivered and were close to my job. all of my order was correct and still warm. Perfect lunch."}
{"text":"WOOOOW.  So again today Sunday the 2nd of November.  I placed order by phone. Drove there to pick up and was told they were out of potatoes  AGAIN.  Who ever gets paid to do there inventory plz call me so I can get paid for half ass work.  Go to burito express on higley and Guadalupe by circle k"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. The guacamole looked like baby poop. Save yourself the time and money and eat out of a garbage."}
{"text":"I unfortunately am going to have to agree with other reviewers. I am a huge A.T.S. fan . My favorite location is 7th st. However, this new location is not up to the high standard that they initially set for themselves. Some of the staff were way lacking in professionalism as in they were screwing around and being super loud as they were making the food. Not cool. Not all of them but a few. My bean burrito Terry's way which I usually love and completely devour was way too salty and bland. I did not even finish it. Also, as other reviewers stated, this new location has none of the charm of the 7th ave or 7 st location. When the food, service, and atmosphere are sub par why would you come back?"}
{"text":"America's Taco is something I definitely crave for.  My go to items are the bean burrito Terry's way and America's corn.  The cochata (coffee/horchata) is also very good as is the breakfast burrito.  I also love how the restaurant is a converted house.  So cute!"}
{"text":"a good, easy and quid stop when you're looking for something fast. It is more fast food-ish then restaurant style but we'd go back If we were looking for something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Yummy food. I had the Tacos Pastor. 1 buck a piece on happy hour:-)"}
{"text":"What a great little hidden gem.  You really kinda miss the place but it's a beautiful, well kept made to order taco, burrito, and breakfast place..  Will be back"}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot for almost a year. We always take to go. Order the same thing every time. 2 Tortas with extra carney and Americas way. Today they mess my order up and give us pork. We are Jewish and do not eat kosher but we don't eat nothing that have pork or lard. We did take couple of bites to find out that it was taste funny. Very disappointed. Try calling, they phone is off."}
{"text":"A friend took me here a few weeks ago. I think I have been back 6 times. Their carne asada is awesome, as good as you can get in town. Their \"Al Pastor\" is the shaved rotisserie thing they have. Also delicious. The people who work there are also extremely friendly and literate too. :)
I'm a regular there now."}
{"text":"The original. I go to the America's in Old Town all the time and the food here is just as excellent. The staff is really cool and friendly and of course I always have to get their homemade horchata w a shot of coffee.

The portions are not big but it is really tasty. The carne asada and el pastor burritos are my favorites here. Get chips and salsa to fill out that hunger craving."}
{"text":"Hello (Adele voice). Now allow me to preface by saying I'm just a white guy. Most white people not named Emeril have no business doing food reviews, especially on Mexican food, so take this with a grain of salt. Speaking of salt, this dish (burrito bowl) was a bit salty. You might be taunting me right now as to the choice made to get a burrito bowl but I'm a bit of a fitness freak. Can you say washboard? Oops sorry getting off track, I have terrible ADHD. Seriously. So yeah the chicken was grilled and tasty, other ingredients tasty but just a bit salty. I wanted to give it a 3.5 but obviously that is not an option and I appreciated the cleanliness of the place, and the customer service. So bumped her right up to 4. I will be back, however if the salt issue isn't corrected my attendance will go down and my blood pressure will go up."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The best carne asada I have ever had!  I like the limited menu- they are good at carne asada and salsa and they should stick to it.  Keep it simple.  Restaurants over complicate things and everything suffers because of it.  Beer will be an awesome addition.  My burrito came out really quickly and the guy running food and bussing tables (Gavin?) was really sweet and helpful.  A little expensive but worth it-- I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"They are good but pricey and sometimes when you bite into what you're thinking is a delicious taco you'll find some kind of strange fatty meat or connective tissue.  This has happened twice on two separate occasions.  They need to do a better job of cleaning up the excess bits off the meat either before or after cooking to get a 4th star from me."}
{"text":"Love the location on 7th st. I passed by it after 5pm and saw that it was closed so I went to this one instead. Ordered an XL bean and cheese burrito America's way! So good. Don't know why this spot only has a 2 star review."}
{"text":"Tried their ranchero breakfast burrito today, not a fan. I'll stick to the bean and cheese because I know I like that."}
{"text":"Good street taco place!  Weird location but we all enjoyed our meal.  Clean inside and friendly staff -- would come"}
{"text":"Bland, unimpressive and overpriced.  Do yourself a favor and drive a little farther up the road and hit up Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"Nothing is better than the meats here. They know what to do to bring out the best favor of meats."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good I wish they offered more vegetarian options. The service is so horrible. The counter person is always rude and  short with you doing the very bare minimum. Almost making it a point that they hate their job. A simple hello is not in their vocabulary They bring the food out peice by piece so once everyone has their food half the group is done. But what really got me is when I called and this is on more than one occasion around 7:45 in the evening they refuse to answer the phones because it's too close to 8 in which they close. Who closes at 8? I have literally let my phone ring for 15 min straight sitting out front while my husband went in to order and they laugh about whoever is calling. So ridiculous"}
{"text":"I really love this spot.  It's one of my go-to places for lunch on the weekends.  The El Pastor (pork) burrito is fantastic.  I've always had great service here and the quality and freshness of the food is terrific.

At times, when they are busy, the service can be a little on the slower side every now and then but overall I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"Tacos Al Pastor and Carne Asada were pretty good, Chicken taco was very bland. Beans were very bland. Cashier was very friendly."}
{"text":"Place is nice and the staff was pretty friendly. Their food is just ok. There are several different Mexican food places around here which are a lot better. I was pressed for time and this place is right across from where I work. I got their carne asada tacos. Nothing special. I would come here again if I were pressed for time again, but other than that, I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Vampiro, wow it rocks.   Happy hour $2 beers.  I love this place.   Pork w/mangos, carne asada, chicken it's too hard to decide.   It's a drive but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Yummy, Wow oh Wow.   Great tacos, burritos, corn on the cob, guac and don't forget the FLAN.   Long drive but worth it.   New location is awesome."}
{"text":"I have to be honest that this is the first review I've ever given less than than 4 stars. 
and after this update a few weeks later I don't think it deserves 2.

After giving this review I sent my picture of the torta to corporate office along with the yelp link and to date 07/10/13. I have received no input or return email.

I digress  on to the review which is indeed my judgment.

I did not wait long nor did I have any issues with my order. .however I was taken off guard by what i thought would be a 7.00 sandwich.  The al pastor torta was very disappointing.. it did not even appear to be shaved meat that is evidently the meat on the gyro looking roaster. however I did not watch them cut the meat.

The meat I received on my sandwich was about 4oz of nothing that resembled anything edible for human consumption as being shaved meat but in fact looked like dog food paste... I'm sorry took be criticle but it was exactly like that.

Little to no lettuce and i can't even remember what else was even suppose to be on it I was still upset I do not see any pinapple and as for guacamole? well maybe it was but it may have been mixed with 3 parts sour cream one part gauc

.. literally less than 4 oz of meat that appeared to be put through a blender. .. what gives?  A flattened bun which was the only appetizing part. A radish cut in half and a slice cuke doesn't make up for a really bad sandwich...

I should have complained but as any one can tell you the last thing you ever want to do is complain about the food to a restaurant. .. probably don't have to tell you why right at least , i hope. I took a picture of it but Don't think i can upload to here"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally did it!  We ordered Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos with the chips with beans,guacamole and salsa trio.  Everything was phenomenal but my favorite was the Al Pastor and beans!  Both were sooooo good!  It's really hard to find true Al Pastor and this place does it!  

It was a bit expensive but it won't deter me from coming back.  I would rather pay a little extra for homemade, good quality food!  

Just a fair warning to the people who think this is fast food, it's not super fast.  It wasn't abnormally slow but I noticed two customers come in and were obviously agitated by the time they got their to go orders.  It was quite busy and all the food is homemade so it's not going to be super quick.  We got our food within 5 minutes and considering how busy the place was, I was happy with the time.  Good food is worth the wait!"}

walking in: clean lots of space nice menu
reading breakfast menu:
No Breakfast Tacos
*sad face ensues*
\"Whatchu talkin' 'bout Willis?\"

I disappointingly order breakfast burritos for my
traveling krew.

to be continued....once My 4-Traveling Duckies have a chance to eat.

well the burritos were actually decent burritos. although I still can't believe that there was no creativity towards the  brilliance of serving breakfast tacos ... 
in a taco shop..I might be back to visit if I'm in Phoenix again :)"}
{"text":"I have lived in N. Scottsdale for over a year now and recently realized two things. 1) America's had a N. Scottsdale location and 2) how close this location was to my house. This was lucky for me since I was craving a chorizo breakfast burrito and ATS serves breakfast burritos all day. I called to place my order and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I hopped in my car and was on my way. The restaurant is located right off the 101 on Via de Ventura nestled next to a gas station/car wash and a few other businesses. There is ample parking outside and plenty of seating inside. Additionally, there is a tiny patio in the front.

Since my first order, I have been back a few times and every time (usually between 8am - 11am) the place is dead. (Maybe one other customer either placing an order or just arriving as I was leaving.) I know they have Happy Hour, but I've never experienced it. Maybe it livens up for a lunch rush or dinner? Either way, the employees have always been nice and my order has always been correct and ready in the time allotted. 

Overall, they have great breakfast burritos. My husband liked their tacos but they didn't pack them to-go very well. (Three tacos inside one foil wrapper make squished/messy tacos.) I'll definitely be back and maybe one day try their Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Food here is crazy good, decent prices and they are quick when you order for pick up. My fiancé usually gets the steak burrito which is packed with flavor. I comes in two sizes. Regular and large. I'd get the large because the regular is a little smaller than you would think. I get the chicken vampiro which is an open faced taco on a tortilla. I am absolutely in love with horchatas however their's is too sugary for me. Staff is nice and friendly and the place is clean and neat :)"}
{"text":"With all the hype that I heard about this place, I was very disappointed with the service and the food. The cashier that took our order seemed very spaced out, offered no kind of friendliness and knew very little to no knowledge to what was on the menu. For being newly opened, this a very bad start to their business. I ordered one of the special combinations on the menu which comprised of two bean and cheese burritos, two carne asada tacos, chips and drink. I wouldn't order this again. The bean and cheese portions were very small and the carne asada tasted very bland. You could get better portions ordering a McDonald's happy meal and with the total price of $18.. it's a rip off. You could easily spend that amount elsewhere that served the same style food and taste 10 times better."}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you. This is \"real\" Mexican food. The owner IS from Mexico but her name just happens to be \"America\", cool huh? Typically this isn't my style of fare, but I DID enjoy my beef taco with just meat and cheese.

The restaurant is in a beautifully restored historic house (as is typical of new CenPho venues). They have a little outdoor patio over looking 7th Street which was way cool.

One thing that I think should be stressed is that this aint cheap. They sell bottles of Mexican Coke for $2.50, the tacos were like $2.25 each, and chips and salsa were an extra charge.

Still yet another great addition to CenPho!"}
{"text":"Very pleased to find such a comfortable spot in Old Town. Small menu but all the basics covered, & you defiantly don't leave hungry."}
{"text":"Beans, beans, beans. Seriously the best beans I have had from someone other than my family.

My carniverous friends rave about the beans here so I was excited to try it for lunch. I ordered the large bean burrito. Duh. 

It was everything they described it and more. Tortilla was grilled perfectly and the tasty beans oozed profusely from the burrito. The salsa it came with was okay but kind of bland. But it wasn't really needed. The burrito tastes like the ones my Tio used to make at the restaurant he owned in Santa Ana when I was a little girl. Definitely took me back.

Oh, and the beans are VEGETARIAN. Yes, it is possible to make tasty, authentic refried beans that are not swimming in pig fat!!! Please take note other Mexican restaurants. You can get a whole new clientele by eliminating lard. After tasting America's beans there is no excuse not to make yummy beans without lard.

Last time I went I also ordered their street corn. It was heavenly. Cheesy, buttery goodness with a hint of lime. The hot sauce it comes with is great, but beware, it is a creeper.

Employees are great, and always seem happy to see you.

Why wouldn't you come here? :)"}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burrito...  great food. The tacos are amazing. Authentic tasting."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times (7th street-Coronado district). I can say the place is small but has a cozy feel to it. It's an old converted house to restaurant. 

The food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge (like Filiberto's or Carolina's (Extra Yummy). But the food was decent. 

I've eaten the Vampiro, Carne Asada Burrito, Chips n Guac/Salsa, and America's corn (yummy!!). My eyes are always bigger than my stomach :).  I will say that the last time I did get the corn, it was a little under-cooked. So it was a little harder to chew...but regardless, it was still good. Smothered with mayo, butter, and cojita cheese I think...how can you go wrong with all of that yummy-ness!!

I would visit this place again, if I am down in that area. They also allow you to order online which I think is cool because that line gets very long very quick."}
{"text":"They have the BEST carne asada and bean burritos I have had anywhere in Phoenix and I have eaten at lots of places!  5 stars all the way!"}

Too bad."}

I had been to the one dow town and loved it so it was a must stop.

Breakfast Burrito - B
Carne Spicy Asda Taco - A++
Mexican Coke - A
Staff - A

I would have to say American Taco Shop has some great street style tacos... If you get a chance to visit the downtown stop or Tempe order the tacos to start you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Walk up to the counter to order... be prepared to want everything on the menu... we got the Carne Asada taco (extra spicey for a nominal cost), the softest corn tortilla , guac, chopped lettuce, carmamelized onions, and fire-roasted tomoto salsa, and the Al Pastor, (marinated pork), chopped cabbage, etc, JUST go there.. you can eat outside (weather permitting) or stay chilled inside. Not many tables. who cares. get take out. will go again..yummmm."}
{"text":"The food at America's Tacos is always great. But this location just sucks. Went at 45 minutes  to closing. No beans. \"We didn't make any because we are closing soon.\"  Ok. Just say we sold out. How about an ice tea? \"We are closing soon so we don't have ice tea either.\" REALLY? The beans are why we go to America's. They didn't have horchata or jamica (sp?) either. I understand being ready for close but people were still coming into the store. The manager needs to sort this out."}
{"text":"Excellent food at great prices. Must have the Al Pastor tacos...fresh guacamole...beans. Outstanding food!!! Addictive."}
{"text":"Need tacos after a long work day and this joint hit my radar. Went in all al pastor. Buddy did one of each of the specialities. He loved the chicken. Al pastor rocked. We were not disappointed. Had great salsa with ice ice cold beer. Bravo."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the service is always engaging, even if seemingly a bit slower than would be expected. I've been the only one in the place a couple of times and each time I was mildly surprised at how long it took for my food to be ready. But, if that's the price to pay for good, relatively inexpensive food then so be it-it hasn't stopped me from coming back."}
{"text":"The food was fine, but this stuff wouldn't cut the muster if you tried to serve it here in my home of Austin, TX.

The horchata? About three times too sweet. Completely undrinkable.

The carne asada \"Vampiro\" I ordered was good, but the finely-diced iceberg lettuce mounded on top was ... odd. I've never seen diced lettuce in Mexican food before; maybe it's an Arizona thing. Certainly doesn't do anything for the taste, texture or presentation of the food.

Beware: As Chris L. points out, the tacos come with ingredients not listed on the menu (lettuce and guacamole).

These are small gripes though; as I said, the food was fine. A little more heat (are peppers just unheard of in Mexican food in Arizona?) and fewer surprises on the menu would go a long way toward making this place great."}
{"text":"The only saving grace for this taco joint is the al pastor tacos and only because it wasn't smothered in their awful tasting pico de gallo. The horchata was old tasting and room temperature-ish... How do you manage that? Its supposed to be an iced beverage, The carne asada taco I tried was barely edible. The meat was over cooked and way too carbõn \"charred\". Let me say this... Guacamole is supposed to have avocados in it and chunks!!!!!! WTF? They have the exact same \"guac\" as Filigatos and every other \"Fili or Roli\" taco shop out there ..looks like green ranch....creamy and gross!

Isn't this supposed to a cool, eclectic spot to get Americas B*st Tacos? Well, why dont you stop selling the same crappy tacos as the crappy mexican food joints. Make your own guacamole you cheap bums! Americas \"commercialized, mediocre\" not best tacos... 2 stars because of the Al Pastor taco instead of 1 for false advertising in the business name.. BOO! thumbs down"}
{"text":"A couple girlfriends and I stopped here for a quick nosh and to kill some time because we were an hour early for the drag show down the road at The Rock.  Once we walked up and saw the sign for the \"Best Carne Asada\" we obviously all decided to get something with Carne Asada in it, you can't see a sign like that and get the Chorizo!

Two of us ordered the quesadilla and one ordered the breakfast burrito.  We were told it would be about 30-40 minutes because they had lost a cook for the night.  Ummmm, okay, I can understand it taking a little longer than normal but this place was not packed by any means and let's be honest, you throw some stuff in a tortilla and put it on the grill for a couple minutes.  I don't understand how that equates to a 40 minute way.  We had plenty of time though so we decided to wait.

Our food came out and the general consensus was that we were underwhelmed.  The food wasn't bad but it was THE BEST CARNE ASADA EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!!!  The two of us who ordered the quesadillas were kind of thrown off by there being lettuce in it, never experienced that before but okay.  And the breakfast burrito was soggy.

Would we go back?  Meh, maybe if there was nothing else open and we had an hour to kill again but we won't be going out of our way to make it in."}
{"text":"Carne asada tasted like pure lime. No flavor in the puree guac and the pico was soggy from a can. Not sure if it was a bad day for them or what."}
{"text":"I know this place is still pretty new,  but I was really amazed by how clean and bright the decor was.  The staff was very friendly and cheerful,  and helped me navigate the menu with ease.   The Carne Asada burrito I had was also top notch,  as was the Carne Asada Vampiro my wife ordered.  However, the salsa served on the side was kind of bland,  and the portions on everything were small for the money.   Overall,  I really liked this place,  and it's definitely someplace I'll recomend to friends and family"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and both times it's been great. I ordered the carne asada tacos. Super fast service and great food!"}
{"text":"Americas serves fresh food, has a unique blend of tacos (their pastor has fresh pineapple on it!) and they have great chips and salsa.

Come here for 2 dollar tacos during happy hour and 1dollar chips and salsa.

Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Before I write this review, I have to note that I was born in Mexico and have tasted and been around GREAT Mexican food all my life. This place, compared to the real stuff, is \"A-OK\". I was expecting a little more since the owner/founder is from Sinaloa, Mexico but I think they fell a little short of a great carne asada taco. I ordered a vampiro (which is really only a tostada), a side of beans, an horchata, and chips & salsa for nine bucks. Not bad for the price! The beans were really good and genuinely homemade which is always a major plus but I was completely disappointed in the salsa. This is really make or break for me--even the extra spicy stuff was just like ketchup! And I'm not a super spicy eater at that. All in all, I would go again if say my friends were going, but I don't think I'd go just out of my own volition."}
{"text":"Tacos have complexity but still attempt to stay true to authenticity.  Not your usual, American-huge portions...which is a good thing in my book.  Staff very friendly.  Check for coupons."}
{"text":"We live a 2 min walk from Americas Best Taco Shop, and that's a dangerous thing! Their carne asada tacos are delicious, a little small but filling. They don't have their liquor license but if they did, I would love having a cold Corona on the patio with a bunch of friends. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"This is a little spot in Old Town that has it pros and cons.  I went on Taco Tuesday.. $1 tacos.  They are super small, but we were in fact forewarned.  For the happy hour, you have your choice of chicken or pork and I had both. The chicken was a little bland, but the pork had a good deal of flavor. They state that they are known for their carne asada and two others at our table both claimed that it was in fact, delicious.  For a $1 a taco, it was Fine.  Chips/Salsa is also $1 during happy hour, but honestly, what mexican place charges for chips and salsa?  I got the margarita and it wasn't my favorite- a little on the sweet side.  The wait staff was lightning fast and our food was brought out immediately.  I\"m curious about the carne asada and may go check it out again."}
{"text":"This place is super cute, old house turned restaurant... Love hanging on the patio having a delicious breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Unlike most Mexican restaurants, this one is not especially vegetarian friendly.  The only thing I could find on the menu on a recent visit was a bean and cheese burrito.  Pretty standard burrito in a great tortilla.  Unfortunately, I left feeling decidedly \"lardy.\"

I've heard that the carne asada and pastor tacos are great. 

Having been to both:  I do like the downtown location much more than the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Tried the carnitas taco.  It was ok - 3 stars.  I like them more as a true street taco.  This one had pineapple and sauces to go with.  I like mine with just the meat, onions, cilantro and some spicy salsa.  Heads up, the guac that comes with this is the packaged stuff.  It's not the fresh guac you can buy separate. 
Why the 4 stars?  B/c their horchata, salsa, and beans.  Oh so yummy!  THe horchata was definitely homemade.  So yummy and creamy but not too creamy.  Oh and the beans...I'm drooling just thinking about them.  Simple and oh so good."}
{"text":"A few of us had a dinner together so someone brought over their chips, salsa (spicy and mild), beans, and guacamole.  Never tried the place so this was my first exposure.  All were pretty good and you could tell freshly made. The part I was impressed by most that made this place stand out were the refried beans. At the first bite I could tell these were the real deal. Homemade and NOT made with lard. I'm not a fans of beans unless their homemade and these were it.  Can't wait to try their food.  Seeing as how the person who recommended them was Mexican herself, that's a plus for me.  She say they make their horchata so I can't wait to try everything else!  FYI - It's called \"America's\" b/c that's the owners name.  Has nothing to do with our actual country."}
{"text":"This has been a hard year for many business' and it especially shows here. I haven't gone as much as I used to since it seemed like each time they were out of something. This is an issue considering the menu is already limited. My most recent and last visit, there was almost no meat on my torta. We ordered some chips and guacomole with our food and it was just enough to feel satisfied, but over priced since it lacked meat."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best carne asada in Phoenix. Whether you get your carne in tacos, burritos, or a quesadilla, you can't go wrong. I personally prefer to get my order \"America's Way\", which basically means you get a nice amount of fresh chopped jalapenos with your meat. And we're not talking the kind you get in jars, but fresh, crisp, and delicious. The menu seems a bit pricey, but the food is definitely not poor quality."}
{"text":"I am a proponent of : If you do not have something nice to say - Say nothing at all. 

However - This boat is sinking and someone SOMEONE (an Owner preferably) .. America please read my review!! It is a cry for help. 

Please fix this place. I REALLY want this to work out but - they NEVER have things gone well since they opened. Cold tacos - wrong orders - too long --- awkward service. 

I KNOW you can do better... because you are! The original location rocks. Is this some ploy to increase business at your original? OR has this been franchised out and the franchisee used to be in some other industry and thought one day \"Im going to own a restaurant!\" ... 

Whatever the origin of the problem. Just fix it. So that I dont have to pass this restaurant and drive to the 7th street location for a hot taco. 

Here is a to do list:

Staff needs to smile. 
Staff needs training on how to answer the phone - guide the conversation and not sound surprised you'd like to make an order for pick up. 
Sense of urgency. 
Hot food Hot - Cold food Cold.  If the taco tortilla looks pasty white still - just let it cook a little longer - .... HOT .. 
Dont give vegetarians chicken quesadillas. Its just wrong. 

I can come in as your consultant. Let me know ;) 

Thanks."}
{"text":"Went there for Taco Tuesday this week. The tacos are fresh but the meat is flavorless. Tortillas are ice cold out of the frig. Would it kill them to drop them on the grill for 10 seconds a side. Signs are everywhere saying $2.00 tacos yet when you get to the counter only a few are $2.00. The staff is giggly and chummy with each other but when they come out to your table they drop your plate of food at your table with all the care of a prison guard feeding an inmate in solitary confinement. Yeah I'm talking to you cook Dude. Owner needs to go undercover to really experience from the customer's point of view. All these things I listed are due to poor leadership but fixable. I would pass if I were you."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now..and both times it was delish! The first go around I got the Carne Quesadilla and today I got the Carne Burrito. Both were excellent. Their meat is SO much better then many other chain fast food Mexican places because they actually cook it on what appears to be a very large grill! Their regular sized burritos are not huge but that is fine with me because I will pay for quality over quantity anyday. I will keep going back :)"}
{"text":"What happened?! 2 yrs ago when I went to location on 7th street it was good.  This used to be one of the best places to get Carne Asada in AZ. Not anymore.  I had a feeling it wasn't going to be good after I noticed they have pictures of food on the menu.  It's always a sign of too corporate."}
{"text":"What happened America's Taco shop? While I still enjoy a bean and cheese burrito, I can't get past the nasty smell of sewer in the place. I hardly see any customers there anymore, but that could be because the one guy taking your order and money will pick at his nose in front of you, then go make your food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I visited today for the first time.  The staff was very courteous, and I believe it was the manager or franchise owner that greeted us.  He described the menu for us, and welcomed us to the restaurant,was clean and bright.

That said, I had one of the Carne Asada tacos, and one of the Al Pastor tacos.  Both were kind of average and uninspiring.  Here is the quick list of likes and dislikes about the food.

1. The guacamole was the processed kind, not the handmade kind, this caused it to have a processed flavor which was kind of flat and off.

2. The tortillas were kind of weak, and partially fell apart during the meal.

3. The Carne Asada was overcooked.

4. The Al Pastor was pretty good.

Being a franchise, I don't know if they can change things like which tortillas or guacamole they use, but it would definitely make things better.

I doubt that I will return."}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite bean and cheese burrito EVER! I really love the carne asada, and the Al Pastor is also quite good. During happy hour, I can feed my daughter before play practice for $1.08, and she LOVES it. Great deal, simple good food. Highly recommend if that is what you are looking for."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic, but the portions are disappointing.  You're paying for the quality of the ingredients at America's Taco Shop.  The food is not that expensive, but you're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full.  Just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive.

I had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco.  I love that there's guacamole in the burrito, and the caramelized onions are great.  The burrito is fantastic, but a little smaller than I'd like for $6.  There is an XL option for $1 more.  Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.

My taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?

The restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible that this place is still open and operating. Like many others have said, the employee taking orders was one of the most miserable human beings I have encountered. Such a nasty attitude. I ordered an Al Pastor salad and I don't say this lightly, but that was honestly one of the most disgusting meals I have ever had in my life. Here's how the \"salad\" was put together. Dried out old spanish rice, slimy unseasoned beans-right out of the can, soaking wet wilted lettuce, a giant dousing of sour cream, a second giant dousing of some god awful rancid tasting avocado sauce, a scoop of meat, and a giant scoop of canned crushed pineapple.  I took maybe three bites before I tapped out. Not surprising, I started feeling nauseous after eating there and that nausea has continued into the next morning. Another thing that bothered me was the fact that the same rude cashier made it a point to come to our table and tell our group that they weren't prepared for us, so they were inconvenienced by having to go cook more meat in the back. Ok, so a restaurant didn't have enough food for 12 people on a Friday night? Seriously? Sorry for giving you business."}
{"text":"If you like carne asada, I mean if you really like carne asada, this place is definitely worth checking out. If you like a variety to choose from, maybe not.

The menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco, burrito, tostada (Vampiro) and quesadilla. They do have one vegetarian dish and, of course, chips and salsa.

Now for the good news. The carne asada is pretty good. I tried the Vampiro and the quesadilla. Both were very tasty. Some people have mentioned that the chips and salsa are extra, but most counter service places I've been to charge for chips and salsa. It's worth it. The chips are fresh and the salsa is not particularly hot but has a great flavor.

It's definitely worth a try, especially if you like carne asada."}
{"text":"Small portions. Overpriced. Tasted okay, but would have preferred some Filiberto's tacos for half the price."}
{"text":"I walked into America cycle shop and no one was anywhere. I yelled out hello is anyone working, no response, village I got my keys try to get some type of noise going on but still no response. And every time that I go in around the sour there seems to be no woodworking or no one eat it there so I'm not exactly sure why the space is still open"}
{"text":"We were greeted by a very nice young and polite man named Paul. He was so friendly and helpful. If I was looking for and an employee, I know where to find him. Treat him right American Taco, you have a great employee! 

 Ok, back to the food. Food was great and the quailty of steak was so much better than Chipotle whos meat seems to have more tendons than ever! 

The steak burrito was a definite winner. The grape soda also was a nice tasty treat. 

I saw that they have happy hours and a daily special like taco Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Stopped in this evening because we had never been. Good carne asada tacos. The corn has a cheese rub on it that I had never had before. It was very unique and different. Great prices too. If you're on the mood for some tacos, stop in.

Parking is rather limited though."}
{"text":"It is Independence week and I LOVE me some America's!

Five stars for the bean and cheese burrito.  The. Best. I've. Ever. Had.
They don't use lard and it's just so cheesy and delicious! 

Four stars for everything else I've tried- tacos, salsa, chips.  Somewhat limited menu, but I'll only be going back for the burritos!

Cute, cute place.  I love the artwork and I plan on buying a piece for Nico sometime soon.  The \"Taco Tuesday\" piece calls to me each time I'm at America's.

I wish them all the best as they prepare for their new Tempe location!"}
{"text":"I just can't believe the experience myself and co-workers just had. We decided this place would be a great choice because they offer online ordering! We all only had our individual debit cards so how convenient, right!? NOT!!! First of all when I arrived to pick up our orders they acted like they had never received an online order. OK I though, maybe it is a new system for them so no big deal... Ha!  It took 3 people to figure the orders out. They wanted me to pay for what had already been paid for. It took a good 10-15 minutes for everything to get straightened out. I checked the tickets for accuracy before I left with the food. Ok good to go. Wrong again! ALL of the food was incorrect! They forgot the meat on a Carne Asada Quesadilla. Forgot the cheese that was clearly marked and paid extra for on tacos. Forgot guacamole on everything. Not to mention they don't have sour cream in the first place. Holy crap, never again!"}
{"text":"first time here and I won't be back. place was criminally understaffed for a lunch rush especially considering it's located within a busy office park. the regular sized burrito was 75% empty tortilla and what little steak they included was cold - I guess they're encouraging you to pay for a large burrito, but who would want to eat that much cold meat is beyond me. chips and salsa were stuff you could find in any grocery isle. overall not worse than the time I ate a dead frog, but not worth going back again"}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday. Location was empty should have been the first clue. I ordered a Al Pastor burrito, my husband has the taco trio and my kids a carne asada quesadilla. All of our food was cold at the time it was served. They have meat on display like a real taqueria, but for some reason all of our meat was cold. They put a chopped up lettuce, it seemed slimy. I came home and thought maybe heating the food would change that, it was even worse when it was heated. Save your money this place is gross."}
{"text":"I love America's Taco Shop.  I only gave this location 3 stars due to lack of service. I am used to ATS taking pride in their service.  You can tell this location is a franchise."}
{"text":"This location is the best America's Taco Shop of all the ones I've been to. The quality of the food is a notch above the rest. Even if you haven't liked ATS in the past, I'd suggest giving this one a try before writing it off. The staff are exceptional and the owner of this location is the real deal business owner. When he's not checking in with his customers and managing things he's rubbing elbows with his employees. I've had the pleasure of talking with him more than once and I can assure you he's passionate about his work and it shows in employee demeanor and high quality food. 

I'm a sucker for their Al Pastor and Bean/Cheese Burrito. When you get Pastor at other places, it's usually kind of greasy and gritty due to the cut of pork, but not here. I don't know if they use a different cut or really trim the meat before cooking, but whatever they do pays off BIG TIME! 

I don't always get it, but the Horchata is wonderful. One time when I was talking with the owner, he brought me a Horchata coffee drink - I have no idea what it's called (Horchatalatte? I'm sure if you ask him he'll know), but it was damn near a religious experience it was so good."}
{"text":"America's taco Shop? I live in an America where people are humane to other people (most of the time)., not here, my party of 6 witnessed the owner escorting a middle age woman in here 40's out the door and asking here to sit on the patio, 109 that day. THE OWNER!!. I caught him as he had her halfwaty pushed out the door like a puppy who had chewed a sock. I stop him and politely aske dhim if she could sit with us and i would by her meal. He stated \"there are no seats in here\", the restuarant was about 60% full at the time. I showed him a 2 two next to our table, he reluctantly agreed. I got the young lady situated and went up to order for her. He called me into a side room and was upset that I intervined, he said that this person had vandalized and broke into his business on several occasions and it was on video, he pointed to a window about 5 ft above the floor and statd that she had got in there..Keep in mind the woman is wheelchair bound and disabled in many aspects. I asked if he had called the police and had her arrested, he story began to unravel at this time. He backtracked and began to get irrate, raising his voice and choking up. He really had zero proff that this homeless, disabled, mentally challanged woman was the actual one that entered his business after hours. He had a vendatta against all the unfortunate street folk in his neighborhood. He also tried to add that he was going to buy her something to eat which was a flat lie, when were you gonna do that?, as you pushe dher back out into the street? He called the police and stated that he had an unruley customer. just think if every business owner called Phx. PD becasue of a unsatisfied customer!! I offfered to wait for the cops to show and even was wwilling to give him my name. He is a business owner that is after only one thing: MONEY!!  I dont think he liked my questions and I continued to state that I still wanted buy something for the woman. He followed us out into the parking lot to continue his sissy-type sniveling stating that I should not have done what I did. NEWSFLASHNANCY BOY, I would do it again today, maybe you should walk in her shoes for just an hour, I pray that you or anyone in family has too, By the way you food wasnt all that bad, very light on the meat but good. American Taco? maybe should be just AMERICAN-I-ONLY- WANT-YOUR-MONEY-AND-HAVE-NO-SOUL-TACO,  first and last time to this winey owned taco shop......take care of each other out there..."}
{"text":"Dined over the weekend, made it in right before closing. Must say, I now know to order the XL quesedilla! Chips and salsa I could live off! Will definitely be going back son!"}
{"text":"Order chips and salsa. You won't regret it. I prefer the mild it's my absolute favorite! I love the carne asada but the chicken is SO DARNED GOOD! I do miss the old school location off 7th ave but the taste is what counts!"}
{"text":"This place has TOTALLY gone downhill.

The vampiro open-faced taco is gone. The Al pastor has ZERO flavor, the carne is cut so small it's too small to taste. Officially, this place is worse than Taco Bell.

I've been going to the original America's in Tempe for 7+ years and this is NOT America's. This is garbage."}
{"text":"Wow, love the tacos and the homemade beans and the homemade lemonade. I can hear for early lunch for the first time. Very casual/trendy spot in 7 avenue, I loved the way that the lettuce is chopped very fine and the meat very flavorful.  I did not care to much for the red salsa (I think it was a little smokey for my taste) but the beans were fantastic and super creamy (I need to come back for a bean burro).  There is outdoor patio seating and inside seating with a flat screen.  They have happy hour taco specials, very cool place."}
{"text":"I'm late to the game and can't really add anything that hasn't already been said, so I'll keep this short.

Best carne asada burrito I've ever had. Best pastor I've ever had in my life, and that corn on the cob rolled in cotija should just be called an orgasm on a stick. 

A million stars to America!"}
{"text":"I was driving down Melrose District when I saw that America's Taco Shop served breakfast. I needed something to eat, so I pulled over and went inside. They do not have a big vegetarian menu, so I just ordered a breakfast burro without meat and potatoes. It was decent, but this place is probably not my first choice for breakfast. They also should not advertise it as a Burro. A breakfast burro is pretty huge and the one that I got was the size of a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I used to love the old Mexican franchise that used to occupy this place, but not this one. I ordered a sad little vegetarian burrito, but unfortunately they did not include tomatoes, avocado or lettuce. They charged me extra, but failed to include the ingredients. I could have gone to Taco Bell and ordered a 99 cent bean and cheese burrito, and could have gotten the same one. This taco shop also does not have a salsa bar. Instead they give you a tiny little container and you have to ask if you want extra.  TNT !!! ( Tragic and True)"}
{"text":"The street tacos are incredible and I miss this place so much now that I live in New York. Cheap beers, delicious food, and friendly staff. I also like how the menu is simple and they stick to what they know best. It really is the best carne asada in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Nice people and good food. Happy I stopped in here today.  From the moment I walked through the door the two lady's that I felt with were very polite and very nice! Had an al pastor taco and an Carne Asada burrito. Both are good choices!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for lunch a few times, but when you have the carne asada burrito...  You dream about it for days after...   

Wish they had better drink options with my lunch than a can of coke.  It's still worth trying."}
{"text":"Was able to visit this little 5 unit chain when I was down in Scottsdale for work. I am glad I did because they are making some tasty items here and I think they are worth a visit.

The place has a sleek chain like look like a Rubio's and had some super friendly service. The food on my visit was pretty dang tasty. With taco in the name I knew I was ordering taco and when I saw and heard the sizzle of the grill that cemented it.

I got 3 tacos (Carne Asada, chicken and Al Pastor). They all came dressed with onion, cilantro, salsa and a Guacomole Creame sauce. The Al Pastor came with diced pineapple. All items were items I would order again but the Al Pastor really stood out. The smokiness and pineapple really complemented. They only offer flour tortilla.

Good, cheap and tasty. Give em a shot."}
{"text":"Always great food relaxing yet festive atmosphere highly recommended! Tuesday tacos are a must"}
{"text":"Decided to try this out before I went in for work and I have to say that I was very impressed. Had the taco trio and the flavors exploded in my mouth. Had many great tacos in my life but this takes the cake. I would definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  From what I hear is that each America's Taco Shop is individually owned and each one is a new experienced.  My girlfriend told me about the one they go to in Tempe and had raved how great it was.  Today we went to this location.

We walk in and scan the menu and notice... no tacos... Their digital menu wasnt working right and was still showing the breakfast menu.  The girl didnt offer any paper menus, because they didnt have any.  What eatery (besides fastfood) doesn't have a menu??)

We ordered the guacamole trio with chips and a few tacos.  The meat was pretty dry on the tacos and if it wasn't for the ton of salsa and guac, they would have been pretty bland.  

Spending $30 for lunch, I was not happy.  The only thing that made it two stars was that they had happy hour and we got a few tiny $1 burros.. they were hot with cheese and were ok.  

Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Phoenix's airport is called Sky Harbor, which makes it sound like an outlet mall, but it's really an airport. And if you're on the way to Sky Harbor from Sedona, and you have time to stop for tacos, America's Taco Shop is a great choice. The guac is good, the salsa is fresh, the al pastor burrito is only a little fruity. The carne asada tacos are probably the best thing on the menu. The prices are very reasonable, and you'll be in and out very quickly unless there's a line out the door like in the picture on the wall from the regional magazine's \"best of Phoenix\" issue."}
{"text":"The bean and cheese burrito is great but the carne asada is the true winner! Put it on anything and you will be happy you did.  Unless you love a full on douse of cinnamon avoid the carnitas."}
{"text":"Very tasty tacos but Los Taquitos is better."}
{"text":"Yay!  I am so happy that an America's Taco Shop has opened up in Old Town.  It is right on Goldwater and 1st Ave, which is conveniently walking distance to my work. A friend and I went there for tacos at lunch today and since it was the first day of their soft opening we got our lunch for free!  The service and food were great and so I know I will be back.

They seem to have pretty much the same menu as the other locations and the quality of the food was just as good as well.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, it looks like the building was formerly a house since there are many rooms instead of one big dining area.  The best part is the large \"backyard\" area.  They didn't have all the patio furniture set up yet but I hope they will take advantage of the grassy lawn and put some seating under the shade of the large mature trees.  It looked really lovely back there.  I can't wait for it too cool down a little more so we can sit outside next time and it looks like a nice spot for happy hour, too.

Only problem is the parking, since it is across from Arcadia Farms who has commandeered most of the street parking for their valet service.  But we were able to find plenty of open spots on Main St, just one block south."}
{"text":"Take out review only.

I tried the carne asada burrito which was clean & not greasy. The flavor was pretty good - a little Americanized, but was pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a terrible idea unless your rich and can order like 5 burritos they are acrimony as shit my burrito was 6$ and the size of like a taquito. My order was 20$ for that and 3 mini ass tacos with no flavor. If your really looking for Mexican food this ain't it. The horchata is good. Anyone recommend a real Mexican place in central Phoenix?"}
{"text":"What an absolute disgrace of an establishment. But what was I expecting going to a place called \"America's Taco Shop\"?

As soon as you walk into this place it smells like crap. The entrance is right next to the bathroom, but even the dining area isn't far enough to suppress the smell of feces permeating from the bathroom.  We were already determined to try out the tacos at this place, so we gave it a shot anyways. 

Originally, we had seen the sign for $1 tacos during happy hour. Just so happens to be that we were there at happy hour. However, the person taking our order informed us that only tacos al pastore (pork tacos) were available. Thanks for mentioning that on the sign. Still though, I was determined to give it a try as my significant other hesitated.

We decided on the carne asada burrito, its almost impossible to mess this up, right? Wrong, unfortunately this place messed it up real bad. First, the food is mediocre. Compared to a place like Filibertos, which doesn't have special food but rather generous portions for a fair price, this place is an absolute rip-off. I probably should have read Larry's review before hitting this place up.

I could have bought FOUR of these burritos at $6.50 a piece, and it still wouldn't beat Filiberto's or Chipotle. In fact, if you gave me FOUR burritos from here for the price of $6.50, then I'd STILL go to Chipotle or Filiberto's. Anyway you do the math, it just doesn't add up. Portions are too small, place smells like crap, and food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"We got here around 7:30 on a Thursday night. They were:

1. Out of al pastor meat
2. Out of chicken meat
3. Only had enough to make 1 small cochata drink.

This considerably dampened our dining plans. Nonetheless, we ordered 2 regular size carne asada burritos and the last remaining cochata. 

The cochata's horchata component was literally scraped from the bottom of the barrel. As a result, I couldn't taste much horchata flavor. Instead, I tasted more of a vague creaminess with a lot of grit from the bottom-of-the-barrel cinnamon and rice particles. The coffee component was fine. It had a smooth flavor. 

The carne asada burritos were quite flavorful. I enjoyed the marinade the carne asada was in, and there was also a little bit of guacamole and some pico de gallo in the burrito. It came with a small cup of salsa, which looked like it would be good, but tasted bland and watery.

Service was decent and our burritos were made in no time. We got our order to go and along with the cup of salsa, our brown paper sack came with a baggie of lime, radish, and cucumber, and a plethora of napkins.

Hopefully next time if I'm in the mood for America's Taco Shop again they won't be out of most of the main meat components of their menu!"}
{"text":"Service was very fast and friendly. Unfortunately, the al pastor burrito I had was very bland and the meat was a little tough. Compared to the other locations, this one has the least tasty food for some reason, at least for al pastor."}
{"text":"Compared to the America's Taco Shop on University, this location is newer, has plentiful parking, and is quite spacious. The quality of food is about the same, plus they also have a design-your-own soda machine! 

We stepped in on a Saturday night, and there weren't that many patrons here, but more trickled in after we ordered. We shared a veggie quesadilla, and I had a carne asada vampiro. The quesadilla was nicely grilled, and the veggie components were flavorful enough that I didn't miss the lack of meat at all. The vampiro was a crispy corn tortilla layered with carne asada, veggies, cheese, and guacamole. The guacamole in tubed form was kind of weird (Taste was OK), but for less than $4, who am I to complain? I got spicy salsa on the side. Overall, it was a good balance of textures and flavors. I tried some al pastor too, which had a great spice mixture on it. I appreciate that you can see the rotating spit the al pastor is on, so you know you are getting something freshly carved off the spit!

Service was cheerful and friendly. It did take a little longer for our food to be served, but we didn't mind since we had the make-your-own-drink station to keep ourselves occupied.

Overall, if I'm craving America's Taco Shop, this is the location I'll be at!"}
{"text":"The tacos here are delicious, but the problem is they are only affordable on Tuesday Taco day. Any other day they are expensive considering you can eat one in a single bite.  I have never been back a second time, but if you are coming here for tacos I would suggest only coming on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"The best place in town for a bean and cheese burrito! Love the chips and guac too. Great menu and priced right. If you are looking for an authentic burrito look no further."}
{"text":"Heard about this place through co-workers who couldn't stop talking about this place. Decided to give it a try for lunch one day. The service took a lot longer than expected, but I figured since it was the first week, they were still ironing out the kinks. The food was all right. I had a carne aside burrito and some chips. The burrito was small, compared to what you normally get and tasted all right. I liked the grilled veggies inside. The chips tasted stale and the salsa tasted like canned salsa. For the cost, which was pretty expensive for a burrito and chips, I could have made a better meal at home. I will mostly give it one more shot, just to see if it's any better. But having a Mexican food restaurant is Arizona; you need to be on point, because there are hundreds of places just like you around the corner!"}
{"text":"My lunch was disgusting!! Very oily mixed with watch.. almost looked like soup!!  It was definitely a trash can worthy lunch.. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"I'd heard a lot about ATS, so I had to try it out. I love me some tacos, tortas, tostadas...pretty much all Mexican food. ATS does not disappoint, but it doesn't top the charts. 

First, the service at the Via de Ventura location is awesome. Friendly, helpful, just plane nice. 

The atmosphere is fine, not great. It's conducive to hanging with a larger group, moving tables and being silly. 

The food is good, but it lacks some flavor. However, the portions are generous and the cost is low. You can get a lot of chips, salsa and guac without breaking the bank. I was hoping the tacos would rock my world, but they didn't pack the punch o was hoping for. 

Finally, the margs were okay. Not like the cheap sugary drinks at some places, but not he best."}
{"text":"this has been a pretty good lunch spot near my work. but after  the last few times, I probably won't be coming back. 

I always get an El pastor burrito, and every time (but once), and especially today, the burrito is half delicious El pastor, and half black crunchy prices of charcoal. I think those are actually burnt scraps of El poster scrapped off the floor or from behind the grill, but they still taste like crap."}
{"text":"Always a great time at americas. Food is quality and staff is friendly. I prefer the carne asada burritos but you can't really go wrong with anything on the menu! Online ordering only makes the experience easier!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst customer service experience I've had in a while. Front counter person acted like she was doing me a favor. A little thanks would have been in order after she got my order wrong and I had to drive back there. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"It's ok. The price point doesn't correlate with the quality and size of the tacos. I've had better quality tacos for $1.25. Wish I had more to add."}
{"text":"The food here was unbelievable for fast, healthy mexican food. (no lard in the bean burro major plus)

ALTHOUGH the set up of this place is a NIGHTMARE. Parking is straight up unplanned, and when you walk in \"it's like checking in at an italian airport\" (-J. Donaughy) - there is absolutely no order.

I was probably the only person who wasn't smart enough to call in my order, and everyone eating at the restaurant looked like they were in hour 3 of their 4 hour lunch."}
{"text":"I had a grilled chicken burrito awesome reasonably priced. Then I had a side of ceviche omg 3 oz container 3.99  wtf ."}
{"text":"3.99 for an 3 ounce cupof cheviche . WTF unbeleiveable this is a franchise storeon 7 thst the same price 3.99 is 8 oz  make your choice"}
{"text":"I initially thought it was good but maybe not great when I first tried it but found myself going back and trying the pork instead of the beef and that is when I connected with this place. They cook the pork in a one of those rotating gyro meat cookers with a whole pineapple on top, with the outer skin removed so the pineapple juice continually bastes the outer layer of meat as it cooks. I had the burrito with pork and that was great and then...I tried the torta, that lovely Mexican sandwich. It was on this great, fresh, soft torta bread with a layer of guacamole, not to thick, and then a layer of pork, enough to provide a taste, but not too thick. I loved it! I also like their mexican corn, though it is a bit messy and I have only had it once, since you eat it right off the cob, sprinkled with white queso cheese. 

So, a reliable place for a quick lunch. The prices seem a bit high for what they offer but...I keep coming back so they must be reasonable. I think that basically they are more of a quality than a quantity place, which is a nice thing to see in a place essentially offering fast food (but not junk food like at many corporate fast food joints). Try it out, I don't think you will be dissapointed. :-)"}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are amazing. How they make any money is beyond me... So affordable and delicious. Staff is always smiling and friendly. Killer margarita, and a coca cola freestyle machine.

Tens across the board."}
{"text":"Ok - so five stars? You ask . . .really for a small taco shop with a small menu? But here is why - I think that inexpensive eats are hard to find - especially ones that are worth eating at. But this is the place - I have tried a wide range of items on their menu - and this morning I ventured to America's for a little breakfast burrito. Everything is always great!! Also - not over done or over complicated - just good simple food. Enough said!"}
{"text":"I really wasn't impressed. Came here with some friends to grab some takeout, and nothing really made me smile. The al pastor was 'meh', at best. The carne asada wasn't particularly noteworthy, and though the vampiro was tasty, there wasn't anything hugely redeeming about it. Nothing to write home about.
Sucks, because my friends in Arizona swear by this place. I'm giving it three stars more out of courtesy to them, but my own personal experience here wasn't anything over two. The people who worked here were very friendly...  I've heard that the ceviche is the bomb diggity... I wish I could come back here and give it a better review, because I'm sure that next time would be better, but as it stands right now, I'm just not a huge fan.
Sorry guys!"}
{"text":"Been a few times and all were a treat. The help were very nice[i guess people react to how they are treated]. 2$ Pacificos in Phoenix, Got to Love it!!
Also a great place to ride your bikes. Be seeing you there."}
{"text":"This place is really cool! I ran into this place on accident while on a bike ride around Scottsdale. This place is a quaint little house/restaurant on the corner of a block, with a huge backyard/patio area. There is not a lot of \"decorations\" inside to create an actual theme, just very basic nothing really created. They have a TV, tables and chairs set around a pretty decent size rooms. The patio area is beautiful! They have a fountain in the corner, the brick fence is covered in vines, there are very large trees to create shade and they have hung lights around the outside to create a relaxing ambiance. Its nothing spectacular, but simple and peaceful, even with it being right next to a main road. They have a pretty decent menu from the basic tacos and burritos, to vampiros! I had a carne asada taco and a carne asada vampire, both were very good. The meat had a good flavor too it, and I am not a huge guacamole fan, but their guacamole gave the taco and the tostada a really nice kick. I also ordered a side of chips and bean dip. The bean dip was a little bland, but it was nice to have real style Mexican bean did, then the refried Americanized bean dip. I took a little bit of the hot sauce and the guacamole from my taco and added it to to bean dip and it was delicious.

This is acute little place to stop by if your in the neighborhood looking for an easy breakfast, lunch or dinner! I definitely recommend the vampire (basically a tostada) and enjoying the nice AZ weather out on their patio!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on Yelp and thought \"man, I have to try this place, sounds great\" I was sourly disappointed with my burrito. OK, the girl asks me if I want regular or XL for my carne asade burrito (which they claim to be the best carne asada in town) I of course say XL because i like food and want a lot of it. The burrito was 8 bucks and they only have cans for soda. so my meal was about 10 bucks. the girl brings out my burrito to me on the patio and i look down and I think \"is that all\"  For 8 bucks i would of thought the thing to be huge! It was about half the size of a Filibertos burrito. And double the cost. 

The location was cool, had a nice little outdoor patio with misters, the girls were nice at the front, and it was a clean place. The food was a  good quality and tasted pretty good. But a little expensive and very small portion for calling a XL burrito for 8 bucks. 

I am afraid I will not be back."}
{"text":"We had America's cater our daughter's birthday lunch. Delicious! Delivery was right on time, food was great and you get a lot for the money! A definite crowd pleaser for both parents and children. We will definitely we using them again!"}
{"text":"Cashier was really energetic and nice, his first impression started out the experience great.

Place was packed with a line, and the food still came out promptly.

I'm 100% Mexican so I know genuine Mexican cuisine, and I am now a fan. Will surely be returning. I recommend the carne asada quesadilla! 

5/5"}
{"text":"I love King Taco in LA, but this was the best carne asada taco I have ever had. It is a small stand....deliciosa! Crispy, flavorful meat, great salsa! Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Tried this place looking for my last chance at authentic Mexican food. Poor choice. The veggie quesadilla while not bad didn't satisfy my desire."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different than your typical concession stand hot dog. I do like the fact that Chase Field is doing more to bring in more business and food options.  Walked my Americas Taco shop and figured hey. Long line must be good. 

First off, they have a pretty basic menu so you can get your food and back to the game quickly. Most of their popular items are already made and waiting to just be grabbed and served. 

I decided on the Carne Asada Burrito. Comes with your standard Pico, quac etc.  From the first bite it was a bit of a let down. The tortillas tasted more store bought, the meat was very bland and burrito overall was just bland.  Lacked flavor and I ended up tasting more Pico then carne asada itself.  I also was not a big fan of the large pieces of onion. Definitely not diced like Pico should be. 

It wasn't terrible, but for a $10 burrito it was a major let down. Guess I'll stick with the Dback Dog!!"}
{"text":"My wife and daughter like America's Taco Shop and always order the bean and cheese burrito. My daughter says \"yummy and perfect\"! My wife branched out a little and ordered two chicken tacos. She says \"tasty but tiny...soggy shell that falls apart...too much guacamole. It's a chicken taco not a guacamole taco.\" I ordered a carne asada burrito and I say \"awesome! Spicy and good but not too spicy. Cooked onions in it so good!\" They need to change their name to America's Carne Asada Shop. 
The good: Service and burritos. Also liked the salsa.
The bad. Tiny soggy tacos. And pricey. Plus 4 of the drink buttons on the soda machine said \"empty\".
3 stars is my review and I'll be back for burritos but nothing else."}
{"text":"I drive by all the time and finally stopped to see what it was all about. I was not disappointed! This is the best mid level Mexican food that I have had in a long time. I got the grilled chicken burrito chips and hot salsa all of which were very flavorful, but not over the top. Oh yeah, the tortillas are really good too!"}
{"text":"I travel all over the west (Modesto, SLC, El Paso, Denver, Etc.) and entertain myself by seeking out great food. In particular, I love authentic Mexican Food. Anywhere that serves grated cheddar gets kicked right to the curb.

This place is great! I'm down here for 4 days for the Ironman, and we ate dinner one night then returned the next afternoon for something different. 

The tacos were great, the Guacamole was great, the chips were good, salsa was great. It isn't the atmosphere capital of the world, but that always costs more and goes straight to the landlord. I even ate something I didn't like for lunch made from Shrimp....but I recognize it was still great food.

If you're in Tempe and looking at a short walk over from run of the \"Mill Street\" chain restaurant hell, take the walk!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey but high quality.  $7.50 for a bfast burrito w/o eggs.  Would love more than one small side of salsa and/or a salsa bar."}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and finally went during lunch one day when a coworker suggested it. I asked her what she normally got and followed suit in ordering a cochata (horchata with coffee) and a chicken vampiro. A vampiro is kind of like an open faced taco. Super messy to eat but delicious. Don't let its size fool you. I was definitely full after one. I really wanted to like the cochata but the cinnamon in it gave it a really rough texture. It was kind of like drinking sand. We went back another time and my friend got the plain horchata and said that it had the same texture. I got a chicken taco the next time and wasn't really impressed. The America's corn on the other hand is awesome, highly recommended. There's really no graceful way to eat it without looking like a slob. I chose to cut the kernels off with a knife to avoid a huge mess. I could go back just for that. Apparently they're really well known for their carne asadas but I have yet to try it. Maybe I'll try a quesadilla next. The restaurant is super small. During lunch, our food came out before we even grabbed a table. Also, it's not really a good location for groups. All the tables in side are 2 seaters minus a booth set-up in the front. I wish they had a heater for the outside too since people are forced to sit outside when it's cold out."}
{"text":"First time in today.  When we walked in we were greeted and started looking at the menu.  After a minute or two I explained to the girl we had never been there before.  Normally this would be a chance for someone to really explain the menu or maybe recommend something.  Talk it up a little. That didn't happen.  After another couple minutes I asked her what she would recommend.  We got a really short answer, carne asada is good and bean and cheese burrito is good.  I was hoping for a little more.  Anyway, we ordered and got our food fairly fast.   I don't have any issues with the food.  It tasted good.  The complaint I have is on the price.  It was 8 bucks for a burrito and I really didn't feel like it was enough food for that price.  Anything else costs you extra.  On top of that a can of soda is 1.50.  A bottle of soda is $3.  Really?  I understand a company has to make a profit but I will stick to water for that price.  Not sure if I would go back.  I think there are places with just as good food, where you get more for less money.  The food tasted good and if it was less price it would would be worth it."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high because of the hype and press but I wasn't all that impressed. The menu is very limited, all items are a la carte, the portions are tiny and they charge for salsa. 

The signs boast the best carne asada in the valley, and while decent it was nothing spectacular. I really liked that they had iced coffee with horchata, it is one of my faves. 

It is a cute spot in a great downtown location. Hopefully the menu will expand over time."}
{"text":"I got the burrito bowl with shredded chicken. It was good. I don't think there's anything amazing about this restaurant that sets it apart from other places. The portions were good, the prices were good, so its a solid place to come, just not drive out of your way for."}
{"text":"I seriously can't find a good taco in AZ to save my life. Tried this for the first time yesterday. I ordered the Taco Trio which had a carne asada taco, a chicken taco, and an al pastor taco. The Al Pastor taco that came with it was the least desirable. The salsas were bland as well

In response to Jill M the owner: WoW!! You probably need to not tell me about my tastebuds and worry less about me getting out. I get out plenty. You know what they say about people who assume. Right there at 3235 West Ray Road \"America's Taco Shop,\" the tacos I received were lack luster. Maybe it was the time of day that I went. Who knows. As someone who has friends who make great tasting AUTHENTIC tacos in their home, I have yet to find restaurants in the area that compares. You may have the best Carne Asada and Al Pastor around the Valley, but you didn't the day I tried your establishment. If you had a tenth of business or perhaps customer service sense, you wouldn't have responded in the fashion you did. Essentially placing the blame on me instead of apologizing for not being satisfied with the $9 meal I paid for. If you ever receive a review from a dissatisfied patron, perhaps respond a bit like this: \"WoW!! We apologize that you were dissatisfied with your food. We would love to have you back to try many of our other options.\" No need to thank me. Feel free to copy and paste that quote for the next dissatisfied customer's review. :)"}
{"text":"Probably should be one star. 

Store bought chips and tortillas. 

Scrawny meatless overpriced tacos devoid of any real flavor and the carne tasted gamey. 

Ordered beans, didn't get them but they didn't charge either oh well.  

No rice?!?  I'm befuddled by this especially as it is billed as a home style Mexican. I've never been to a Latin American home (pick a country) that didn't have a pot of rice. Plus rice is cheap, easy to make and filling (and might have made it easier that's I ate three skimpy tacos and I'm still hungry) 

Corn - flavorless!  Plus you've GOT to grill that corn to have it right.  Nasty.  

But the Horchata is good."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood taco shop! I had carne asada tacos and wanted more 2 hours later. They are fresh and flavorful and priced very well. 

They also have great happy hour specials and weekend long beer specials. I think it is like $2 for pacificos all day long saturday and sunday! Amazing!"}
{"text":"Does this place deserve all the hype?  Yes.  
Is the restaurant a great fit for the neighborhood?  Yes. 
Is this the place to enjoy the best tacos?  That is debatable like all things in life.

Located in the the historic Coronado neighborhood in an old renovated house like many other businesses in the area.  If you know the area you know what I am talking about.  It's not in a strip mall like most of metro Phoenix.

So why come here?  Here's a few reasons that I have come up with.  It's not to far from downtown so it's a convenient location for lunch.  It's hip, trendy and definitely not like anything you would experience in the rest of the valley.  It's very authenic. Prices are not very high.  Lastly the carne asada tacos are really really that good.

I think America and her husband made their dream come true with the creation of this restaurant.  A small taco shop that serves up some great food, decorated very uniquely, and definitely different than most things out there."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food here. The story is quite unique but most importantly the quality of the food has not been compromised with the franchising agreement. The food tastes just as good as it does at the original location, amazing!!!! My favorite is the grilled chicken quesadilla"}
{"text":"Amazing and professional i have eaten all over The  world and this place kicks ass for The money try the spicy burro and fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Great food! They make it very fast aslo."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican food places. Their carne asada is to die for with great prices! The shops aren't always the most clean but the deliciousness of their food makes up for it."}
{"text":"not too thrilled. food is overpriced, the portions are mediocre, and while the ingredients are of decent quality, the result is very dull, and bland. Tried the Al Pastor Vampiro (this little... tostada thing), and the Carne Asada Burrito.. (though it was more like a taquito, in size), and refried beans. Beans were decent.. soupy though."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for lunch/happy hour. It isn't quite authentic, but their salsa is good, al pastor tacos are $1 on happy hour, and all their meat is high quality."}
{"text":"What a great food!  I mean... Place!  Well, the food is great too, and the service is nice as well.  The interior is fun and bright, not to mention it's kept clean.  There is outdoor seating if you so wish to eat in the breeze."}
{"text":"Well where do I start?? I am a huge fan of pretty much any good Mexican food, but this place was a huge let down. I went with my fiancé she ordered the street tacos and I decided to try the burrito because I was a little hungry, we also decide to order some chips and guacamole. The portions were small and overall very over priced. 

Here is a breakdown on the food. 

Guacamole and chips- the chips were stale and the guacamole was not that good. Not to mention the portions were small. 

Burrito-very small but had ok flavor 

Street Tacos- very small with a very limited about of meat on each of them not to mention that the meat was cold and lacked real goof flavor. Only one taco was good I don't remember which one other then it had pink meat. 

Don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"Great customer service, the environment was clean & a very comfortable place for dinner & simple conversation.  Loved every bite. Thanks americas taco shop, your the best!"}
{"text":"I love Chipotle, but America's Taco Shop is better and cheaper. Flavorful Mexican, without all the grease, tastes clean and healthy."}
{"text":"Americas is great. These prices are hard to find too in the \"fancy\" part of town (the arts district, which often means jacked up food prices...). They have a lovely outdoor patio, which has ping pong. We spent a few hours here on a nice afternoon. Plus their staff is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"I have to say I've been a fan of America's Taco Shop for as long as I can remember. I frequent the two Central Phoenix locations often and make sure to bring everyone there when they want amazing Al Pastor, Guacamole, or anything else.

I opened my mind to this location, it is their first corp freestanding location since Kahala brought them under their umbrella. I was worried, I can't lie. I generally have a closed mind to corp locations but I had to give this a shot given my history. 

I walked in there ready to say, this is nothing like ******. Instead I walked in and found a familiar face, Terry. This comforted me and brought me back to reality, I was safe and trusted them now.

Well I can report that everything tasted exactly how I expected. I got my usual to compare with the new location, Al Pastor Burrito, Guacamole, and a Horchata. It was a 1 for 1, I tasted all the rich flavors that I was accustomed to and I was excited. I now have a location near my work and 2 near my home, see you at lunch!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week, the selection isn't huge but the food is always delicious. Can't go wrong with a large carne asada burrito. Staff is always very friendly and helpful. Great spot. My only gripe is I wish they had a larger selection of salsa. Nothing is spicy enough!"}
{"text":"Worst America's Taco Shop location I've been to. I typically go to the 7th St. and McDowell location. My burrito came out incorrectly, and it's just beans and cheese. The service was horrible. The staff whistled at us to let us know our burritos were ready despite the fact that (a) they gave us a number and (b) we were literally a foot away."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Great spot to grab a burrito on the run. The staff are always a little disorganized but service is good nonetheless. Try the Co-chata (horchata and iced coffee); it's amazing."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite spots for a delicious burrito. Definitely recommend the el pastor burrito, you MUST have their beans - they don't use pinto beans, they use peruvian mayacoba beans (and don't use lard) = LIFE CHANGING!!! 

And be sure to finish it off with Co-chata (iced coffee + horchata)."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to restaurants after a night out, however I think I'm going to have to start looking for a new place, staffing is mediocre, and for whatever reason they are ALWAYS out of potatoes, I feel instead of coming in 30 minutes early to prep for the day they get ready 5 minutes before opening at 9 am, it's just frustrating when a restaurant is constantly out of supplies, if I didn't enjoy the food I would give it a 1"}
{"text":"A little pricey for the portions but the flavors are outstanding. Homemade horchata is like my nana used to make."}
{"text":"Why can't we make a big deal about tacos on each day of the week instead of just Tuesday?  

Americas Taco Shop figured it out and they celebrate Taco Tuesday all day everyday.  Whether you want steak tacos, chicken tacos, fish tacos or even just a bean burrito they got you covered.  Dining area is spacious and the staff is friendly.  Come here any time during the day and feast yourself on some great tasting tacos.  I prefer getting them American style with a side of chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"What is this? Mexican food for ants??? They should rename it America's Smallest Tacos. Seriously, ridiculously small, about the size of your palm with 3 tablespoons of meat. I am not a big eater or overweight by any means and I would need about 6 of these tacos which would cost $14.50. Sorry but that's just crazy. If I'm going to pay grotesquely inflated prices for Mexican food I'll go to Mango's in Mesa where at least I feel like it's a value. That being said, the favors were fantastic, really delicious marinated meats, the corn with cream sauce was amazing. Great chips and salsa too. If you're ok paying for it, it's a tasty place to eat. I just can't justify the cost."}
{"text":"some of the best taco's you can find in phoenix.the meat was cooked to perfection & spot on for taste. i also tried the vampiro,somewhat like a carne asada tostada.the place is clean and has a nice atmosphere.try to avoid the lunch rush to enjoy your meal.although i wish the salsa was a bit spicier."}
{"text":"Three reasons I must have America's every week!
1. Carne Asada (no matter how they wrap it it's good!)
2. Possibly the best bottomless chips and salsa in town.
3. Breakfast burritos. All of them are awesome."}
{"text":"On several occasions your restaurant has been closed when it states its open may sound trivial to the owners evidentially but typical need to take your hours off your yelp page and the sign on your door. I won't go to this location anymore the food is decent but the night crew isn't and it's as the food the same at other locations."}
{"text":"I saw the segment on America's on Sonoran Living and wanted to check it out.
They have an extended patio now, which was nice-had some heaters too which was nice on a chilly night.
The interior is cute and charming-an old bungalow style home with some tables thrown around.
The menu is tiny. there are just a few choices-and nothing more than carne asada, a bean burrito and ceviche one night a week.  That's not horrible but don't come here if you are looking fora  vast area of menu items. 
Cheap and tasty and the salsa for the nachos was the best I've had since arriving in AZ 2 1/2 years ago. Tamrindo juice was also very tasty."}
{"text":"Damn good!  The guac is a bit on the expensive side but very tasty.  All of the tacos and breakfast burritos that I have had there are very tasty. This place is legit."}
{"text":"It's ok, I've eaten here a few times and haven't been disappointed but I'm never rushing to go back.
The restaurant itself is immaculate and the service is super friendly so 5 stars there."}
{"text":"I don't eat meat so this review may not be helpful to everyone.

Chips & guacamole- seemed like equal parts avocado and equal parts tomato.....not crazy about tomato. The chips were good.

Veggie quesadilla- I use the word veggie loosely. Lettuce, barely \"caramelized\" onions, cheese and guacamole. It came with a salsa that lacked heat and personality. No bell pepper. No mushrooms. No cilantro. 

Dining experience- outdoor area was pleasant.

My husband ordered 3 carne asada tacos because they are \"The best in town\". Tacos were skimpy on the meat which was fine with me because I want him to quit meat anyway.

We came here because of the Check Please episode. Sadly, it wasn't worth it. I didn't even eat all my food nor did I take home leftovers.....that never happens."}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place and will not return if I find myself in PHX. 

The staff members were cold and unhelpful. When I asked the server whether they have brown rice and black beans, she rolled her eyes and said \"we're not Chipotle. We only have Mexican rice and whole beans.\" A \"sorry, but we don't carry those\" would've been a better move. Also I ordered my chicken bowl with a reduced portion of rice but ended up with mostly rice in my bowl. 

The food tasted alright but the portions were quite small. Prod your fork into the seemingly large bowl and you'll be disappointed to hit bedrock after a 1/2 inch - there's not much food in the bowl at all. I saw them portioning chicken and it couldn't have been more than 1/3 cup. I had to actually go to another restaurant for a 2nd dinner I was still so hungry after America's Taco Shop."}
{"text":"I don't claim to be a mexican food authentication expert, being from here and raised on chimichangas smothered in sauce and cheese.  I do know good, though, and this stuff is way beyond good.  Costs more than other order at the counter mexican places, but the quality of the food is worth it.  Really good margaritas was a nice surprise in a plastic cup.  Carne asada to die for - I had to order a second burrito.  Their refried beans are the best anywhere.  Staff have always been very nice, patiently waiting as I try to decide what to order, and not acting at all put out when I'm finally ready."}
{"text":"I love this place. The carne is perfectly seasoned and the portion sizes are just right. I have worked across the street from this place for a few months and each time I eat here I am never disappointed. It is definitely worth the try. ;)"}
{"text":"Out of pork, out of guac, slow service, order arrives incomplete. Wait, wait, still no corn. Oh look, girls behind counter are too busy chatting to notice food is ready to be served. Too bad, really wanted to like this place. And now that I think of it, they were apologizing to a guy about his order as we walked in.  No surprise."}
{"text":"America's Tacos makes me happy.  From the cute retrofitted house it resides in, to the perfectly cooked Carne Asada that is tender while still retaining a crispy charred exterior - this place is awesome.  They also serve the best beverage ever created by humankind - the Iced Coffee/Horchata.  A great place to bring out of town guests to..."}
{"text":"Excellent flavor and value for the price. Here for a 24 hour layover and strongly considering coming back tonight for dinner! Wish there was one in Texas."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the toilet overflowed right before I walked in here. I'm not being mean, it really smelled like they had plumbing issues. So if they were that's probably a freak thing, and doesn't affect the rest of my review, which wasn't very good by the way...
This place is definitely not worth your time and especially your money honestly. Take it from a Hispanic who LOVES tacos, burritos etc...I can name five places within five miles that are way better for the price. The Burrito I ordered was large but hardly contained any beef (I ordered a carne asada burrito). It also had rice, guacamole, pico de gallo. and it was flimsy, burritos are not supposed to fall apart lol, the salsa was meh...the reason I think they may get a lot of business is because of the location. It's right on the corner of Rural and University. How can it not get business being located there? It's a college student hangout because they live within walking distance, close for when they are hungry... Spend a little on gas or the bus and go up the street."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to spot when I am hungry! They are fast and efficient and the food is always delicious and extremely fresh! I love the employees there sweet and work hard ! I LOVE Americas Taco shop! The beans are so amazing!! They have the best bean and cheese burritos in the Valley that I have found! They have really good chicken Tortas and I love the corn !!!!!!! This place is my favorite !"}
{"text":"This place is so bomb!! I come here almost two or three times a week! I live right next to it !! The beans are bomb!! The best bean and cheese I have found here in Chandler(or Phoenix in general) They also have great and efficient service ! I love that they also have margaritas and a few beers to choose from. This place is amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Awesome happy hour! Awesome music! Awesome service ! I love America's Taco Shop ! The Chandler Location was my original spot but now I live in Scottsdale and I'm SO GLAD they have one close to my apt! This place is awesome ! Best bean and cheese burritos in all of Phoenix !!!!!!!! Making the mini size was genius !!!"}
{"text":"The entire burrito had the consistency of paste and tasted like plain oatmeal. The employee didn't hate life, just his job. They said it would take 5 minutes, it took 15."}
{"text":"Not my favorite taco shop, read yelp reviews before going looked good. Once we got there and ordered the food was so bland and tasteless only good thing was the beans!"}
{"text":"XL CARNE ASADA BURRO-has never been this good ANYWHERE- words just describe  how good this is"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, I really did. I live right around the corner, so I have tried out America's a few times, but sadly...I don't think I'll be back. I mean, the food is ok. I do appreciate that the beans are lard free, and the margaritas are surprisingly good (they are in one of those margarita machines, so I had my doubts), but the food has been just - \"ok\". Truth be told, I haven't tried the famous carne asada (I'm a vegetarian), so that may be the best thing out there, but for burritos, rice, chips, and salsa - it's just not all that impressive."}
{"text":"I'm kind of disappointed by this place. My friends always hit up the one in Old Town so I figured it had to be good if they were frequently going back. 

Everything was just meh. Nothing was special about the tacos. I ordered the trio with hot salsa and I think my favorite was the carne asada. For the price, you can probably find some better options. This just was just whatever and I had heard so many good things about America's Taco Shop...but if you read the reviews here I guess I wasn't the only person not loving it. Maybe I'll give the original location shot bc this was no better than the many chains circling around."}
{"text":"What would my family eat once a week if not for the bean and cheese burrito of heavenly goodness made only the way America's can!"}
{"text":"America's is good! Not my favorite taco in town, but for the price and location I am very happy and will be back!

It tasted like there was radish in their salsa, if you don't like radish don't use. 

The chicken and carne asada are delish. My husband favors the burrito."}
{"text":"Service was cold and impersonal, and the food wad not much better."}
{"text":"Carne Asada burrito was delicious! The food is reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'm very busy at work today but wanted to take a quick couple minutes to yelp about this place...

The carne asada burrito was great - alot of flavor, juicy, did not make my stomach hurt (like places like Filibertos sometimes do).

I'm confused at some of the reviews that call it pricey....My lunch companion mentioned it was extremely cheap (and he always complains about high prices so that is saying something!).

The place is very cute and just a perfect little place to grab a simple, delicious lunch (if you like carne asada like I do)."}
{"text":"For a local taco chain, I enjoy America's Taco Shop immensely. Especially the Al Pastor with grilled pineapple and carne asado tacos. Its fast, relatively cheap with deals on certain days and easy. For some reason, the burritos don't have the same tasty effect so I recommend sticking with tacos. I do not recommend the ceviche they serve on weekends.

America's has the best Taco Tuesday deals, if you want to try it out, Tuesdays are great. They occasionally run out of Al Pastor meat which can be disappointing."}
{"text":"Best \"street style\" carne asada taco I've ever had.  

The Vampiro is basically the same think but it comes on a tostada so you have to pick it up and eat it like a vampire, thus the name Vampiro.

The salsa is great, I don't know what \"style\" it is because every now and again I've had it other places but it's my favorite. It's a cross between a pico and a red sauce, blended but not runny at all.

Yes they make you pay for chips and salsa, and I've seen the tiny tablespoon size take out container for salsa so beware.

Cute restored house.   I'll be back soon, if not everyday from now on."}
{"text":"The refried beans are the best beans I've ever had, and I'm from Mexico. A must order with a side of chips. Their Al Pastor torta is also also favorite along with the Carne asada vampiros. Ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"Fun little place with good tacos. Love to sit on the patio with a cervesa and a couple carbon tacos. Fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"THE BEST Carne Asada burrito I have ever had, the quac was fresh and delicious, loved the salsa and the horchata was great too.  I had NO complaints and my boyfriend has been raving about this place for months so I had really high expectations."}
{"text":"First of all, I would like to thank Georgie for making this recommendation. I would have never found this place. 

I came here after a workout and was excited to try this place. Based on all the yelp reviews I ordered the carne asada burrito and quesadilla. My wife ordered the Al Pastor burrito. Everyone was right the carne asada burrito was so good. I usually will not eat onions but everything in the burrito was so good. I gave my wife a bit of my burrito and she wanted to switch cause it was so good. She couldn't stop eating it. The Al Pastor burrito was good and I thought the mango brought a real sweet taste to it. The carne asada quesadilla was really good. I think anything with carne asada is just outstanding. I wasn't disappointed at all. This is one of my top spots. 

All those other Mexican restaurants, look out cause this is one of the best with really good prices."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY disappointed in their burritos. The two that a friend and I ordered was filled with meat and barely anything else. The burrito was so limp I felt bad eating it. 
Never going back."}
{"text":"No flavor. Over priced. Not good service. Menu and management change. No good. 36 bucks down the drain. Would I go there again no. Mexican food doesn't have a small or large burro. Lol ... that's was pretty comical.  No rice? Wish old owner was there."}
{"text":"Delicious. I'd write about what I've eaten at America's Taco Shop, but it would take much less time to list what I haven't eaten!

Some of my favs - Both the carne asada and al pastor tortas are mouthwatering. And their bean & cheese burritos are as good as it gets. Try the one with diced fresh jalapenos added for an additional $0.25. I also crave their guacamole. Definitely try their conchata - iced coffee and horchata mixed together. 

The only downside - don't come here with friends if you're looking to have a conversation. You'll all be shoving food in your mouths too fast to be able to talk."}
{"text":"Yay, a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that's vegetarian-friendly! 

My kid and I loved the (homemade?) horchata, sediment and all--even better that its served punchbowl (punchbucket?)-style. 

I had the bean and cheese burrito, served some special style with raw onions and Tapatio sauce inside. Tasty! Because we don't hit that area of town much and I didn't know when we'd be back, I tried the corn as well, with all the fixin's, that is, lime, cheese, cream(?) and Tapatio. Not really my taste, but it was the most elaborate corn-on-the-cob I've seen. 

My kid was happy with the bean burrito too, sans the onions and sauce. My wife had a quesadilla with grilled onions. It was a little small, but looked good and she seemed to like it. She loved one of their flavored margaritas, the maroon one with a funny name that starts with a j.

We also all shared the chips, salsa and guac. Not a fan of creamy guac, I stuck with the salsa, which i loved, but my wife, a guacamole connoisseur, really liked it. 

We'll be back..."}
{"text":"No. Just no. 

So small inside. When I sat down to eat my food in the corner I felt like I was in time out. Dead on a Friday night. 

Ordered the #2. Three different mini burritos. Great way to showcase three times in one visit that I don't like your food. We were told the salsas were spicy but they weren't. Chips were ok, a little salty. My burritos that had meat inside (pork and beef) were very dry. Not appetizing to me. My husband had a breakfast burrito and said they used fake eggs which is a pet peeve. 

We won't go back- Rubios is around the corner with $1.50 fish tacos on Tuesdays that are actually yummy. Sorry America. I don't like the food."}
{"text":"I'm actually glad this one went under. The place was filthy, the staff was rude, and the food sucked. When I found out that an America's Taco Shop was in my area, I was thrilled. The euphoria quickly went away. I would actually drive 20 miles to a non-franchised. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Came with a large group. There were only 2 people working. The wait was incredibly long. The people before our group demanded to have their money back. They made a huge fuss. We just went with be flow. For the price of what you get, the food was just okay. Skip this place. Any other Tex Mex would suffice. I will say that the staff were very kind and understanding, despite their own frustrations."}
{"text":"The carne asada is to die for!!  Inexpensive and simply delicious!  A great stop either before heading to the airport or after landing!"}
{"text":"Originally came in t get elpastor. They said they don't have any today. Got the two carneasada tacos for $6.99 comes with a little bit of rice and beans. Rice and beans was bland. Tacos guac was good and fresh. The carneasada was okay nothing extradonary. Expensive for what it is. Service was also okay."}
{"text":"Found this today while cruising down 7th on my way to Roosevelt Row for some belated Christmas shopping. Very cute interior. I got the Torta, which was huge and extremely tasty with moist, seasoned asada, guac, veggies, and jalapenos on a soft buttery bread. Mmm!"}
{"text":"America's Taco Shop has several locations throughout Chase Field. I visited one on the 3rd floor, which was nice because there was no line and my food was ready in about a minute.

As for the food... well. It was better than the tacos served at Gila River Arena during Coyotes games, but just a tad better than mediocre. It had a timid flavor, and the green sauce that came along with it had a better sweet/spicy kick. The tortillas tasted like something from the grocery store and were completely splitting apart. I was glad I thought to grab a fork and some napkins.

It was edible though not very filling. I have never been to one of their full restaurant locations and now I really have no interest in doing so."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday. I ordered the al pastor burrito. It was a first for me. It was good. It almost didn't happened because when we got there, they said they ran out of tortillas for the burritos, and just as I was about to order a bowl, someone said they have tortillas. It's a small place, and the back patio is a lot larger and of course they have musters running which is great. The server was friendly and brought out our meals. I was also curious about the tamarind juice they offer. I tried it but it was super sweet. 

I am not sure about this next part which I did not consider for my review, but I don't use my credit card often... And I used my credit card here. An hour later, I got a fraud protection alert saying there was a large purchase using my card! I suspect that someone skimmed my card while I was trying the tamarind juice. I cannot confirm or deny but just to be safe, I recommend bringing cash."}
{"text":"A colleague and I went to ATS yesterday for lunch and again were very pleased with the meal. Now I am not a small appetite and it may be because the food is super good but the only downfall is the size of the tacos. However we both got the Taco Tuesday deal which you can't beat. The Carne was well marinated and cooked to perfection. The place is small so if you happen to go there on a hot summer day during a lunch rush you may not have the best experience however we sat outside on the patio and enjoyed a great lunch. This is one of my top go to spots for Carne Asada in Phoenix.  My colleague had been there before and got the Torta and said it was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Scottsdale has so many fufu fancy fusion style twisty no look resaturants. It is a breath of fresh  air to get a NEW restaurant that stays true to its classical Mexican roots. 

ATS hit a homerun not only with the food and service but also the location. The Carne Asada burritos as well as the Pollo Asada are phenomal. I also go XL on the food trust me you won't regret it. The food leaves you full and not bloated like many other Mexican restaurants around Old Town. 

The back patio as a cool ambiance and is a great place to get out of the Old Town scence for a second. The chips and salsa are delicious and they also have a good quesadilla. I would recommend this place when your looking for a good go to Mexican meal."}
{"text":"This place is trash, burritos are weak and the carne asada has a weird flavor to it. I know many of the tacos shops around here (phoenix) Lol but checked this place out because of the review. Idk what happened maybe this place was decent once but not anymore. The service is ok, bt what really killed me is the food. There stingy as hell with their servings, you go to any other taco place or Mexican food place and they make these burritos look like tooth picks. on top of that the food is bad, what I mean is the meat. It's bland and it doesn't feel like quality meat. It was cheery. Point blank ur better off hitting any of these food trucks on the corner streets"}
{"text":"This place is really close to where I have relatives live, so it is a very convenient place to eat.  There is nothing about this place that says, \"Hey I gotta go to America's Taco Shop\", of course there is nothing that prevents you from going either.   It is not a bad meal at not a bad price."}
{"text":"Although I like America's Taco Shop, I actually am not much of a fan of their tacos. I do really enjoy the breakfast burrito and bean and cheese burrito, which I usually get.

On my last visit, I decided to branch out and ordered a regular size quesadilla. It was tasty, but it was ridiculously tiny for the price. It was almost smaller than my hands and i have strangely small hands. I would also stay away from the chips and salsa because the salsa is pretty bland.

For food and value, I would probably give it 3 stars, but the service bumps it up to 4.
The cashier was incredibly friendly. She was even nice to the lady in front of me who spent 3 minutes asking stupid questions about salsa."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, but there must be a reason that it is empty every time we go in (in the few times during prime time hours that I have went, this was the case). 

This last visit (and final), literally zero customers during lunch time on a Saturday....and it still took almost 20-25 minutes for a couple tacos and a burrito. The meat tasted old and like it was sitting out for hours. And, given that I've been up all night with incredible stomach cramps and the runs, I'd venture to say that it was absolutely the case. 

I'm calling their corporate/franchise office to complain as well as the city health inspector to complain about the apparent food poisoning. I should have trusted my instincts after the first bite, now I am paying for it still at 7am the following day. 

Save your wallet and your bowels the trouble. If you want cheap/fast Mexican, go to Filibertos"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for takeout on my first night in town. I had the breakfast burrito minus the eggs and the cochata. Burrito was good but the cochata made me do an internal happy dance."}
{"text":"This is a little gem.  Sometimes it's best to do one thing and do it really well.  America's does carne asada REALLY well!!  The meat is tender and flavorful and delicious!!  I had a carne asada burrito and it was probably the best I've ever had. But let me speak of the guacamole.....mmmmmm!!  If you like guac, this is awesome guac!!  It's got just enough kick in it and it is very tasty.  Their chips are fresh and crispy and a nice compliment to the guac.  My daughter loved the cheese quesedilla and ate the whole thing.  When we got in the car to leave she said she wanted to come back the next day!  That's high praise from a six year old!

The shop is a cute little house with several tables inside and a nice seating area outside.  Parking can be a little of a challenge.  There is only one way in and it's the same way out.  So if you're leaving and someone is coming in, well....you get the picture.  

The staff is always friendly and accomodating.  They make you feel at home.  The prices are reasonable so you don't break the bank either.  
Thank you America!!"}
{"text":"I was really, really excited to try America's Taco Shop but I'm sad to say I was disappointed to say the least. The portions were very small and extremely overpriced. Even with that factor disregarded, the meat was not mind blowing either. I tried the XL carne asada burrito and an Al Pastor taco and both were unimpressive. The pork in the Al Pastor was a little dry and very small. The burrito was okay but it was far from extra large. I was surprised that this was an XL and that I paid almost $10 for it. The tacos were probably 4 inches in diameter and the burrito left me feeling like it was more tortilla than meat and etc (I hate when places are stingy with the meat!). It was not a surprise, however, that the place was completely empty. The service was okay, the woman at the register kept on starting to take our order then walking away to answer the phone. She told us the happy hour specials which were beer and margarita prices that were Very close to the original price. She also said happy hour food was chips and salsa for $1 or a \"small\" taco for $1. After seeing the size of the regular taco, I can't imagine how tiny the \"small\" could be.  I was really hoping this was going to be a great restaurant, but I was pretty embarrassed taking my friend from Colorado here when she was visiting because it probably hurt her impressions of Yelp (since I told her that it was rated high on Yelp). The worst part was that all of us in our party left the restaurant still hungry and opted to go on and eat elsewhere because of the unreasonable prices here. Yelp let me down on this one... Overall, I can confidently say that this place was overrated and I probably will not come back by choice."}
{"text":"Look, I don't like leaving 2 stars based on one visit but I'm not going back. I was so unhappy with the amount of food I got for the price. I ordered two tacos and a small drink. It came out to 7.49. The tacos were soo freaking small I felt like they were little appetizer tacos. Most of the time I pay over 7 bucks I usually get a meal out of it. I was done in like 1 minute. A fair price for those \"street tacos\" would be a 1 to 1.50. I will never go back. I'm not on a diet and I like to eat. It would take 6 of those tacos to equal a value meal at taco bell. That would come out to 22 bucks. I'm not joking! try it, order three of those stupid street tacos and a drink. You'll pay around 10 bucks and leave hungry."}
{"text":"The carne Assad burrito had no beans and no guacomole in it for some reason. It was just meat and pico de gallo and there was more pico de gallo than meat it was disgusting. I m not sure if the meat was rotten or the tomatoes were rotten I tried to eat it but for 9 dollars absolutely terrible. I will not be back."}
{"text":"My husband's coworker recommended this place for the amazing bean burrito. We decided to give it a try and I am happy to report that I fell in love with the bean burrito tonight. I really like the chips and salsa too. You've got a big fan in me America :) I am going to tell my friends about this delicious restaurant! Looking forward to going back again and again."}
{"text":"After hearing nothing but rave reviews of America's Taco Shop, it was time to give it a try.
I ordered their \"best Carne Asada in town\" tacos. And I beg to differ. There are plenty of places I have had better Carne Asada. I'm going to blaspheme according to some, but I've had better Carne Asada at Chipotle, for meat's sake. I thought the meat was overcooked. I have yet to find somewhere that comes close to Comedor Guadalajara for Carne Asada. The side of beans was ok. 
The staff was courteous and friendly, the service was great.
But, I really don't see what the big deal is about America's Taco Shop. After all the hype, I expected it to be great. But it was good, at best.
With a menu as limited as America's Taco Shop has, they should excel at what little they do offer and that's just not the case."}
{"text":"I really like the carne asada here! Ambiance is fun and festive. Love the the beachy Baha feel!"}
{"text":"BAD! Went here with my girlfriend assuming this was going to be the same as the ORIGINAL one on 7th st... Could not have been more wrong. Totally franchised and the people working there were completely un aware of what was going on with their menu. 

First off we ordered \"unlimited\" chips and salsa and at this location there are a Small or Large size.. Well we ordered the large, when I go up to get a refill the guy tells me that \"only the Large is unlimited\" (which is already rediculous and annoying) and when I tell him \"we did get the large\" he says \"oh that's not the large though..\" In which I reply with \"well this is what I was given I paid for a large\" and he replied with \"oh whatever then\" and then gives me half a basket of chips and throws it towards me. 

Then we ordered two bean and cheese burritos (we don't eat meat) low and behold two fat pieces of RED meat in the burrito.

When the food was brought they gave us no napkins or anything. 

Atmosphere is exact of Baja Fresh there is pretty much no different even the tables and chairs are the same it's so franchised its rediculous they are all wearing shirts and hats.

Do yourself a favor and stick to the REAL one on 7th, friendly KNOWLEDGEABLE staff, great service, great food and ONE size UNLIMITED chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"5 F'ING STARS.. Incredible, chips and spicy salsa, burrito, their beans are top noch and the Mexican Cokes and Sprites. Not to mention alcohol, beers, margaritas. Vegetarian/Vegan friendly. PERFECT and FILLING!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, has this place gone down hill. Ordered a chicken quesadilla (because I was told the Chargrilled Chicken Salad was no longer a menu option)....it was overloaded with cheese and onions to the point it was nothing but slop when I tried to pick it up. Worst $8 quesadilla of my life."}
{"text":"This place is ok, not great and missed the wow-factor for me.  I'm a native, born and raised on carne asada, I'll probably die with a burrito in hand. 

As you will see, there are a lot of gringos in this place at lunch time.  Here's a clue for the white folks, good Mexican foods can be found where the Mexicans eat.  

Again, don't get me wrong, this place is ok... just didn't deserve all the hype."}
{"text":"How do you make America better?  Give her a second Taco Shop on 7th Ave and Campbell and let her feed the masses!!

The addition of this restaurant to our community is a welcomed one.  The space that the taco shop took over has been everything under the sun and not been able to stand the test of time!!

The service at either of these two restaurants is always beyond exceptional, greeting you when you first walk through the door and beyond.  I just finished lunch and can't wait to go for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Beans are no lard and are outstanding! Regular sized carne asada burrito is kinda small could have had the large no problem. Tacos were excellent."}
{"text":"No, just no. Don't do it, you'll regret it!!   Came in for a quick lunch and got the three taco plate to go. I'm not a big eater but when I pulled it out of the bag it was literally the size of one Rubio's Fish taco - which I DO recommend you get. I opened them right away and proceeded to eat them but they were still cold and clammy. They all had different delicious descriptions (Carne Asada, Al Pastor and Chicken) but they all tasted the same - bland bland bland!!  I actually rummaged through my glove box to find a salt packet which I did thankfully find, better but not by much. The only thing that would've made this meal good, it's to have gone to Rubio's!!"}
{"text":"I am at the elliot location.
They do not serve margs.
The food is ok
The food to me is fast food as it came out in 1 min.
Mark who ever u are is wrong."}
{"text":"Last night my fiancé and I stopped in and had wonderful customer service from Hunter at the front. He kept checking in with us to make sure we didn't need anything else (even though this restaurant isn't a sit-down with a server) and he was really sweet and attentive. If we needed anything, he didn't hesitate to help and he didn't make us feel like we were bothering him even though he was busy. It's very hard to find such great work ethic and customer service here in Arizona. We were presently surprised. We have been to other America's taco shops in the valley and this one is by far the best. The carne asada is always fresh and the tacos were perfect. Shout out to the chef, too! It is apparent the owner actually cares who he hires and how his store is run. If the manager or owner sees this, big pat on the back to Hunter; he deserves a raise :) He's the reason we'll be returning! Thank you, Hunter!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place no stars if I could. I won't be going back to this one. I was told by another location that they're individually owned, which is why the standards are different. It seems like they only hire people at this one who hate their job. Their meat is subpar, especially compared to other locations. Their steak is a different cut. It seems like most other locations have upgraded to the prime rib and this one hasn't. Their chips are always stale. But the most annoying thing is they are NEVER open when they're supposed to be. I check their hours online but they aren't true. They close whenever they feel like it. I will gladly drive to the one in Chandler off the 101 and Ray road instead."}
{"text":"Over priced for portion size. Good luck actually tasting the guacamole in their food.  Also look out for cold food, half way through my carne asada burro was cold. I will say that they did replace it.  Otherwise the taste of the food is great."}
{"text":"When I saw \"America's\" taco shop I thought it was meaning US, but to my surprise it's after the owner named America :) 

What a great surprise! It's quite authentic, the tortillas, the meats, the salsas, the menu items, even fresh Jamaica and horchata DELICIOUS!   

I wish they had more locations, I would eat here more often. Needless to say, when I'm near by I stop by."}
{"text":"Hurl! If you like bland food, canned cheese and cold food this is the place for you!  Don yourself a gator and go to Taco Bell instead!"}
{"text":"Ok so I went to Americas for the first time and I gave them three stars because I feel that is the most that I can give them. It is a cute place but they only have two kinds of meat..... Carne Asada and Al pastor so those two meats in tortas, tacos, quesadillas and burritos. I had the Al pastor quesadilla and the smallest Orchata I could get. The quesadilla was pretty good the Al pastor was properly made the Orchata was extremely sweet and definitely from a powder mix. My real disappointment was the price for my small meal, 8 dollars my friend got the larger quesadilla and a can of soda and that was over 10 dollars. The food was pretty good but definitely over priced for a normal workday lunch."}
{"text":"Horrible!! Food was cold, bland and expensive. On top of all that... I FOUND A HAIR IN MY TACO!!! Why did one of them have pineapple in it? Why didn't it smell like food was cooking? Why are they still in business? Don't waste your time!!"}
{"text":"So the food here is super delicious. However, the portion sizes were ridiculous. That is why I'm rating it a two. We could get the same kind of food for the same price, but double the portions at cafe rio. We like to find little yummy places and we are new to the area so we'd figure we would try it. I got a carne asada bowl, which was delicious, by I wish it was like twice as big. My husband got a chicken burrito and it was the smallest burrito we had ever seen. So, the food was good, the portions were not. And we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"great ambience, clean, very good.  a little pricey for my taste, but oh well. that's why it doesn't get five stars.  and they have this tamarindo margarita with lucas and chamoy on the rim (not at the tempe location just yet, but apparently the phx location).  it's delicious! you must try it!!!! AMAZING."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Everything is made fresh. Their salsas are delicious. The chicken burrito and the carne asada vampiros are a regular order. Call ahead though. You may be waiting a bit due to everything being made fresh"}
{"text":"I don't even care about the 'overpricing' of this place, I'm more concerned how downhill this place has plummeted over the years after being sold to the company behind 'Blimpies'. 

Food quality sucks
Food options have been removed ex: ceviche
Service sucks


The old carne asada recipe was seriously what made this place. 


Now just trash."}
{"text":"Very limited parking at this location. The burrito I got was ok but not very flavorful. If someone wanted to take me here I wouldn't be opposed but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Several issues here. As is typical with many old town locations, zero parking. But of course the more important issue is the food. I've come here twice and both times had the same issue:  lack of textural complexity. Every part of my burrito or burrito bowl is exactly the same texture. It is all soft and smooth and doesn't require much chewing. It's almost like having the components of a burrito puréed and put inside a tortilla. I will admit that the Carne Asada is tasty but everything else could use a little help. How about some crunchy peppers and onions? Or beans that are not puréed? Or a sultry pico de gallo? I mean, some of this stuff is already in the burrito but the texture of it is squishy and not what I would expect or want.  So...overall: meh."}
{"text":"It's alright. I don't get the crazed collegiate love for this tiny taco shop. Granted it's only been open for a month or so, but since it's their third location I doubt the menu will change any time in the future and that's really my gripe. 

Carne asada and al pastor pork. 

That's it. 

They'll serve it in just about any iteration of a \"tortilla + meat\" that Taco Bell has dreamed up six times over, but fact is you're stuck with either carne asada or al pastor.

Needless to say the meat should be mind blowing to carry such a limited menu. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out. And I'm sorry, but $2.25 is pricey for one bitsy taco. I could almost get two tacos for the same price at my other taco dives.

The elote was also disappointing. I understand that it's \"America's corn\" and their spin on it, but there was zero chile or lime flavor to the corn. It was very tender but totally slathered in mayo and powdery cheese. I added some lime and chile spice with their dipping sauce, but it was still just so-so. 

I'm a taco fiend so I'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt with three stars (when I really want to give them two). And even though I'm at ASU just about every day of the week, I can't say I see myself coming back."}
{"text":"Went back to America's Taco Shop last night for my fourth time. I used to think it is over-rated and too expensive, and after last night, I'll just say that it truly isn't very good. $20 for dinner for two is reasonable enough, but the food is absolutely the blandest, most americanized, excuse for Mexican I've ever eaten. I grew up in Phoenix, in a hispanic neighborhood, eating Mexican for almost every meal every day. This place is not the least bit Authentic... it's just a gringo excuse for mexican food.

The patio out front looks like some amateur do-it-yourself'er made a trip to Home Depot and built a budget enclosure. Seriously? you put plywood up in your parking lot... that's not really a way to make a proper patio. I can't believe the city allowed this debacle. 

The kid who took our order on our last trip didn't know what was on the menu and repeatedly asked the woman there what was included in our meal. Learn the menu before you go up front and start working... this is not his fault, it's poor training and management. 

Please boycot this restaurant so it can go away and the building can be used for something useful. There are a lot of great places up and down seventh street, but this piece of crap brings them all down to a lower level."}
{"text":"more expensive than a filibertos, almost as good..but you pay for the atmosphere, so its nice."}
{"text":"Ordered grilled chicken salad. It was pretty darn good and satisfying for a fast food taco joint. Not chincy on the cheese on top (which i was disappointed due to dieting, yet delicious) or the chicken inside. Chicken was not bone dry and inedible, pretty moist as fast food goes. Lettuce was leafy, green and fresh.

What stood out to me was there was a young lady empolyee that had finished her shift that had noticed my my eyes wandering (people watching is a hobby of mine, dont pretend you dont as well) and asked if all was ok and if I needed more dressing. Well, in fact I was fine but thanked her and said no. 

Never have I seen an employee in a fast food place ask so politely AND on their own time, as she was obviously off the clock. 

So hey, all you America's Taco Shop head-honcho's, this girl is management material. Or at least a shining example of how all employees should treat all customers.

I'll be back for sure.

I did take the time to point it out to the head-honcho who was there at the time of my meal to ensure she was given props!"}
{"text":"Did a little Taco Shop pub crawl around OldTown Scottsdale a couple weeks ago (because the first place we went to had tacos the size of... idk something way tinier than a taco should be.) America's Taco Shop was our second stop of the night and I was pretty happy with the size and flavors of the tacos. The Al Pastor was a delightful combo of sweet and savory flavors.

In my opinion, the \"taco Tuesday\" deal could be a bit cheaper, but I'm not complaining. This location was pretty dingy though. We sat outside to get some fresh air and it was sort of a ramshackled assortment of chairs and tables and there were bugs everywhere (monsoon season), but the strung lights made it appear somewhat quaint.

I would go again, just maybe to a different location next time."}
{"text":"Great location in an old renovated home - very cute. I suggest you get the large burrito as the regular didn't have much meat. I will be back to sample the entire menu (one of the most affordable options in old town btw)."}
{"text":"I went in again, and it was amazing! I had a carne asada taco, it was perfect.  THe salsa is not too spicy, and super fresh, and the carne asada was done perfect.  The Corn Tortillas were a perfect touch as well.  I just hope everything goes well with the liquor license, I would of loved a coronita!"}
{"text":"What a great place. Relaxed. Great food. I don't have much more to add. But this app wants me to type more."}
{"text":"You know when you have a habit of being a repeat customer, when they ask \"where have you been?\"  I can honestly say I stop in here a lot!  This isn't a fancy place but the food will be awesome.  They have a huge patio and now they have add a ping pong table.  This is a great place for friends and family to come together and have a great meal.  

Bean and Cheese Burrito, America's Way.  Everyone must try this!!  Best burrito I've had (sorry grandma).  Add an order of chips and salsa and your order is complete.  

ATS has the friendliest staff and is the best place to grab a bite.  Hike, bike, run or walk to ATS soon!"}
{"text":"Great food at a great price.  I love this place!  I don't even know where to start about America's.  You have to get the chips and salsa.  The chips are so light and crispy.  They go perfect with the spicy salsa.  I always get the Bean Burrito America's way.  Lard free beans with jalapenos and homemade tortilla.  This is the best kept secret in Phoenix.  I am so glad they have locations throughout the valley to meet the cravings of the masses.  I hear they have a mean breakfast burrito and I will have to try one of these out."}
{"text":"The food is decent but overall I think the name is a stretch. Had the carne asada taco"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night before going out some friends, at one of the gal's suggestion. Myself and another arrived before the others and ordered before their arrival. The menu is fairly simple and concise - just a few items which you can customize. I like that. What I would appreciate is an image of what the small and large sizes are- couldn't decide based on the cook's description.

While the gal running the shop was super sweet and helpful (checking in on us consistently, taking up trash when we were done eating, the food was just kind of meh. Nothing special. I ordered an asada quesadilla and checked in on Yelp! to get the free chips & salsa. There wasn't  a ton of seasoning with the quesadilla, nor the salsa. One of the friends got a salad and didn't use the green dressing- I ended up dipping my chips into that since it was delicious! One positive though is that they have a Coke Everything machine.

If I come back to one of these shops, it may be as a last-second-I'm-hangry decisions."}
{"text":"America's - still very happy with you. I wanted to write an update, because I think your breakfast burrito's are great. 

However, I have a recommendation.  Every place that I go for breakfast in Texas has Breakfast Tacos. Tortilla; chorizo/carne asada; eggs, chile. Given that you now own the rights as being one of the best taco shops in Arizona, would you consider adding breakfast taco's to your menu? think about it- your lovely carne asada; some eggs; etc. I'm just thinking of options to add to your breakfast menu. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Very good tacos.  A bit small, but that is the nature of the street taco..  The vampiro is where it is at though.  Seemed to have more flavor and was more filling for sure.  Next time, I'll get two of those and skip the taco.

They have some good deals for two with burritos tacos and beer.  Going to try that next time."}
{"text":"Great quality but my steak  burrito had NO steak. Burrito with a small side  of rice was more than  $10. It should be packed with steak for that price but it was a struggle to find steak at all."}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne asada taco the al pastor quesadilla and the al pastor torta. I was highly disappointed with all the food. Food was over priced I would have been more satisfied if the torta would at least have some rice. I will not be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the food is delicious. But look at this little thimble of sour cream. Come on."}
{"text":"Heading to Thailand so I want to eat something that I can't get there.
 
The food was palatable but I didn't really enjoy it.

The taco trio with chicken carne asada and al pastor was blah.  The meat was dry.  The carne asada was the best of the three.

Beans were undercooked and too al dente for my taste.

Flavor was bland and lacked the richness I can get from the taco truck."}
{"text":"Restaurant on the outside of security. Ordered 1 quesadilla at 11:08 and got it at 11:16 as the only person in line.... Ugh.

The packed the quesadilla full of shredded lettuce ??! What? The yellow salsa that came with was too sour and didn't pack any heat.

It needed a creamy queso component and the chicken lettuce mixture itself didn't really have any flavor.

They were also completely out of bottled water."}
{"text":"I come here on Sundays for the breakfast burrito deal! Choritzo burrito is the best in town. Go on a nice day so you can sit on the patio."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a high 3 stars but I'll round it up to 4. The thing that really stands out here is the carne asada. You can get it in taco, burrito, torta and a few other forms but the ones that I usually get are the burrito or torta. The burritos are always pretty good but sometimes they seem soggy and aren't quite big enough for what they charge. The carne asada does stand out above other places in AZ though but the whole package of the burrito is somewhat lacking in my opinion. I would say the best thing to get is the torta, you get the delicious carne asada minus the soggy burrito and the jalapenos on it gives it an original flavor that makes this my favorite place to get a torta around town. Anyway, solid place and although not my favorite I definitely head here when I'm craving carne asada in Tempe."}
{"text":"A 30 minute wait for ONE burrito? I won't be coming back. Thank you for wasting my lunch time."}
{"text":"Very slow and confused service. Food was pretty good but overall experience was a negative based on the wait."}
{"text":"Joined my parents today for lunch after receiving a gift card. I had two Al Pastor tacos and one Carne Asada. I thought they were great minus the pineapple in the Al Pastor. I think I also tasted ginger or something in the seasoning. Maybe I'm just not used to that so it threw me off, but unfortunately not in a good way. I liked that they give you your salsa and food comes topped with garnishes (I'm a lazy one). 

It's a fast-casual type of restaurant. Not the best for groups but you can make it work if needed. Also a big plus is the $10 for $15 they have on the Yelp app! I didn't realize until we had already paid, but I still think that's awesome!

My parents really liked their meals. My Dad ordered a burrito and my Mom a tostada + taco. I would definitely come back here for lunch! But more likely on a Tuesday since they do $2 taco deals ;)"}
{"text":"My overall experience here was pretty good. You order from the counter.  The guy at the register that night was very entertaining.  He had several recommendations. Even if you didn't want them, he would magically change your mind. There is a large patio outside to hang out, prices are pretty fair and the food was good."}
{"text":"I really hate writing a poor review....but..these tacos were mediocre at best.  I hade the al pastor, grilled chicken and Carne asada......not one of those three were good.  The service was friendly.....I'm sorry...not coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good, like all taco joints pretty hit or miss. This is my fav over the hippy shop but this place is also a couple bucks more expensive, and when your talking tacos, that absurd. oHH and this place is open later than the Local Hippy taco joint."}
{"text":"This place should be the first stop on your way back from the airport especially if you are picking up visitors.  There really is no excuse to not stop there if you are anywhere within a five mile radius.
The guac is scrumptious and chunky, but not overwhelmingly so.
The carne asada burrito is bursting with the stuff dreams are made of...melt in your mouth perfectly seasoned carne asada with a little mini key lime wedge that is just begging to be squeezed."}
{"text":"So far, best carne asade in Phoenix, although I am still on the hunt (Nothing yet like Tucson's BK's).  Small menu leaves a little to be desired and their burritos have just the right amount of carne, but not much else, something feels like its missing.  Good food, great place to try couple things.  Will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"The place was clean and the employees were very friendly. Our food was served fairly quickly -- It was prepared fresh, so I didn't expect instantaneous service.

My son loved his quesadilla and said he wished he had ordered two. I had a carne asada burrito, which I found hot and tasty. Nothing terribly special, but definitely not bad. I think you'd really like their food if you love avocado -- I tasted a lot of that on both the taco and the burrito.

The el pastor taco I had was interesting. I found the flavor reminiscent of the BBQ pork you get at Chinese restaurants. It looked like the meat had the same pinkish ring and brightly-colored exterior glaze. The pineapple enhanced that flavor. Maybe it is just me. I may have to go back and order it again just to see if that's how it usually tastes. 

Overall, I think it is a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've eaten at ATS three times now and I've been consistently pleased with their food.  The staff is friendly, there's a real buzz to the place (especially around lunch time) and the decor, while simple, is simply nice.  While not a big meat eater, the carne asada tacos are hard to resist and the vegetarian quesadilla is terrific.  
I'm sure there will be some who think the food is a bit pricey but it's all of high quality and, in my estimation, well worth the money.  There are plenty of options for cheap Mexican.  For my money, ATS is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I ordered the chargrilled chicken burrito. It was delicious, but so tiny. I ordered the regular size. It should have been made clear that it was actually a kids sized burrito. For $7, it was a complete rip off."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but why do they close so early? 8pm and they're practically on ASU's campus? I think there is a missed opportunity here.

Great tacos, great guac, that's what I get, it's always great."}
{"text":"Probably the last time I will eat here.  The food is tasty, but the portions are small  compared to other hip Mexamerican spots.  Prices are a bit steep, also.  One would think, being a stone's throw from the busiest campus in the valley, that you'd have some less expensive menu items.

Far and away, the most significant reason I'm not in a hurry to go back is the service.  The ordering process is generally quick and easy, but every single time I eat here the person at the counter seems so put out and agitated about having to take someone's order.  And not the same person either.  I know people have bad days, but now it seems like a pattern.  Everyone's struggling to make a buck these days, and it's that little shred of hospitality that makes the difference."}
{"text":"I've lived all over California, I would literally fly to Phoenix for these tacos and burritos, though this hasn't happened yet. The carne asada tacos and burritos are probably some of the best I've ever had, except for one socal taco shop. The guacamole is tops too.   

I have to admit the place is a little out of the way unless you are already near the airport."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the service was great. This just isn't my kind of Mexican food. I think this place would really appeal to an upscale Taco Bell/Del Taco kind of crowd. Everything was very bland, not even a teeny bit spicy."}
{"text":"So many of the reviews hate on this place because of the small menu - so what? You want a big menu? Head to Taco Bell or Denny's. You want a cute little taco shack that decided they're going to focus on perfecting two meats - carne asada and pork al pastor - then put it in tacos, burritos, or on a vampiro? Then this is your place. And randomly, they have grilled corn on the cob as well! 

This is the best pastor I've ever had by far. And the second best carne asada (after the taco cart behind Charlie's on 7th Ave in Phoenix). They cook up everything fresh and to order, yet are still lightning fast. And if you're in the mood to hang out, their outside area is great: benches, heat lamps, sparkly lights.

LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"This place should be named America's disappointment shop instead. When we arrived I had high expectations of this place. The menu looked promising. I had my wife and child with me we both got burritos and al pastor quesadilla and when it came to ordering some soft drinks their options weren't very expansive or inexpensive. Finally the burritos (al pastor) arrived and when I saw the size of the burrito I was super annoyed for the 24 dollars I just spent it should of been the size of a small dog. Needless to say I will not be coming back to America's disappointment shop. The reason for 2 stars was because the meat itself was delicious but it's not worth it. Sorry."}
{"text":"Sorry. No. I'm not sure what the appeal is. 
I ordered 2 tacos: carne asada and al pastor. I imagined tacos like I've had at authentic Mexican taco stands, given the high reviews. What came out? 2 TINY tacos, not double-layered corn tortillas, (instant no-no--not authentic without 2 corn tortillas to hold in the goodness that is a Mexican taco) al pastor filled with mystery bright, hot pink meat (not a normal meaty-pink color), and over-cooked carne asada. The salsas come in a variety of flavors and spiciness. The spicy salsa? Not spicy, at all. The price? Too much for my teensy tacos. If I were you I'd pass, there are fabulous taco stands nearby with horchata just as good or much, much better. One star for the horchata that accompanied the meal."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, not anything too special. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and it was exactly that, nothing more, nothing less. 

For being in AZ, I expected that there'd be a little more \"oomph\" to the variety of cheese or a special sauce. It did come with salsa for dipping that tasted more like a watery marinara sauce than salsa. Id be will to try them out again perhaps at a location other than their stand at the ball park."}
{"text":"Seriously great food, their carne asada burrito is amazing.  I swear they must sprinkle crack on it, cause I keep coming back for more.  I'm here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Great Carne Asada. Chill atmosphere with an awesome back patio. Will definitely make this my burrito spot."}
{"text":"Order up the meal for two: 2 tacos, 2 burritos, chips & salsa, and 4 beers! (soda is optional but not recommended, lol just kidding!). Split a side of healthy (but yummy) lard-free beans and don't forget a couple roasted jalapeños for a little heat. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Considering the overhead they have to be running to have a location like this in Oldtown Scottsdale, they have very affordable prices. The food is authentic Mexican fare of the taco truck variety. Burritos, tacos, tortas, etc. The waitress was very friendly and helped me find the World Cup on the TV, and at one point the cook came out and said hello. I felt very comfortable and relaxed while I was there, and the food was delicious. Great place to grab a bite if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but America's Taco Shop is going down hill. I give this restaurant maybe 6 more months until they close this location.

It's a bad sign when you walk in and you don't hear much coming from the kitchen and you don't get that freshly cooked carne asada smell. I had the carne asada tacos and the meat tasted like it was old and reheated. It also left a film in my mouth afterwards."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get. Nothing special. Salsa is good though. Bottom line. Corporate Mexican food."}
{"text":"The third location by Terry and America and IT'S IN TEMPE!  I am so excited to have this place so close and having been waiting for weeks for the newest location to open.  The interior is a bit smaller than the Coronado location, but not by much and the patio more than compensates.  Same great food (mmm, carne asada...) and happy hour, so you know what to expect if you've been to the other sites.  If you live in near Tempe and wanted to try this place, but didn't want to drive downtown, you are in luck."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!! I asked for a recommendation and the cashier told me their carne asada is the best. Boy he wasn't kidding! Great prices, great food, great service! I'll definitely be returning!! The tacos are small so make sure you order a few. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Driving around looking for a mexican place to grab a quick lunch!!! Ja! there it was a small and rustic Taco place! They only offer carne asada and al pastor in many different ways but there are all great! It was perfect! they even sell beers... awesome! The carne asada had an amazing good flavor... Al pastor wasn't my favorite but very tasty too! Their margaritas aren't strong enough I guess because is a draft one! Very nice place! I'll recommend this place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Just driving through from Texas and very impressed. Clean, bright environment, the food runner who I believe is a manager is very kind and attentive, and the food is great! I had the taco trio, my wife had a quesadilla on corn, and brother had a burrito and we all really enjoyed the food! The guac and salsa are great too! A lot of taco places I leave feeling kinda bad, but not at all this time. Food is well worth the price and I will come here again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Wow, let me start off by saying this taco shop is by far the most amazing resturant ever. The cashier that helped me with my order was very knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients in every item. I believe her name was Melinda or Belinda. The cook, Brian as well was very helpful In making sure my food being prepared was gluten free. I cannot wait to come back next time and try even more items off the menu. You will not be disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, but PLEASE stop playing Lola over and over and over. My coworkers and I heard it 4 times during one lunch. Incredibly annoying. It's playing right now as I'm writing this."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! It's right across the street from my house. The XL Asada burrito is awesome, The Carne Asada is juicy and sooo flavorful, hand cut while you wait. I also got  America's corn and some street tacos! I absolutely love the corn, at first the idea of mayo on the corn put me off but it's amazing, especially with the cotina cheese and sauce they put on it. i love that they give you a lil baggie of cucumbers and radishes with your order, it comes in handy to clean your palate after some of the salsa. My friend had a Margarita but I had to try the Horchata.....so good, just the right amount of sweet, cinnamon and it was ice cold!!! Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"What the crap folks? So much \"blah blah blah\" \"this place is so great\" spewing from Yelpers and the media that I felt like I was missing out.  I finally went to this damn place and I guess I am missing the point because this was a joke.

Their menu has all of about 5 things on it.  Most of them seem reasonably priced until you see their size.  I ordered the Vampiro because it sounded good, had guac, carne asada, and was portrayed as a quesadilla type meal.  Ya, this thing was like the size of a Kennedy half dollar - and half as filling!  What the hell? $4 for this?  I can't even taste the guac!!

If I want cheap good mexican food, I guess I'll stick with 'Bertos because this place is a disaster.  At least at 'Bertos I can get more than 5 items and the burritos are Soviet-car-sized."}
{"text":"I am not one to slam places, but the food was not very good - ok it was bad and over priced.  For half of the price you can get something better at Taco Bell and I don't really like Taco Bell.  Not worth a second trip for me."}
{"text":"Great food. Disappointed they didn't have Al Pastor which is the only reason I came for. Apparently the chili festival needed it more."}
{"text":"In a sea of great Mexican restaurants, I've always found it difficult to find a great taco shop like the kind you can find in Mexico or even southern California. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places here in Phoenix...but, along came America's and man do I dig their grub and their vibe. I've ben eating here regularly (at both locations) since they have opened and have yet to have a poor experience. 

The taco's are great and my wife swears by their bean burrito. Fire up a Pacifico on the patio and life is good. Very good. Best Carne Asada in town? My vote is yes."}
{"text":"I have actually been to the location and the food is not bad but nothing to get excited returning back. Friendly staff and fun setup"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time. Ordered a taco trio. The cook had gloves on and changed the trash. Then he didn't change the gloves and made my tacos in front of me with the dirty gloves he just changed the trash with. 
The staff seems friendly and that they want to be there. 
I cannot comment how the \"trash tacos\" tasted as I threw them away. What a waste of $7.59.
I think the health department needs a visit here soon before people get sick."}
{"text":"The tacos are very consistent and tasty at both locations. I usually get some tacos on the way home after work."}
{"text":"Went here hoping to find Baja Fresh but they closed and now it's a Taco Shop.  The menu is somewhat limited and lacking imagination.  I bought the small chicken burrito with a side of beans.  Both were totally over priced, especially the side of beans, it was a small salsa size portion, too watery and way too much salt for my taste.  The burrito was small for the price but had a good flavor though the chicken was diced not chunky at all.  The sides of sauce that came with it had no flavor at all and went immediately into the trash.
The lowdown is you can go over the highway to the Original Burrito Company, spend 3 dollars less and get a burrito 2 times larger.  Chances are unless something changes I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I love America. I love tacos. Not always in that order, but let's continue. I've been a few times already. And have yet to order a taco. That's because America's Taco Shop could easily be named America's Quesadilla Shop. But, we know, that wouldn't stick. I've had the carne asada quesadilla with lettuce, guac and monterey jack. Definitely on the smaller side, but hey, it's $4.50. And then there's that Mexican Coke. Pricier than the U.S. Coke. Oh. Wait. We're talking beverages here folks. I left the 80s behind years ago! Yep. Mexican Coke has REAL sugar and not HFCS. I\"m not a real anti HFCS kinda guy...but let's just say, this Mexican Coca Cola really rocks my meats and cheeses! But, it's $3. So you gotta feel in a fancy lunch mood. My last visit I added an order of chips and salsa. All said, with tip, was over $13. 

A little pricey. But I didn't mind. Kind of like buying Kiehl products at Neiman's. Or a brick of brie at AJs. Or the expensive toilet paper with chamomile and lotion. Worth it! Especially the latter. I\"m just sayin'!

Great service. Friendly, if not a bit too aggressive. Last visit Miss America herself was there with her cute and chatty daughter. I loved it! Though my kids are limited to a Schnauzer, I like seeing family together in the biz. 

America. America. God bless your tacos. From sea to shining sea. From 7th St. to 7th Ave. God shed your guac on me...."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm only giving this place 4 stars is because of the unhappy service we received. The food has always been amazing here, and I love it! I got my sister hooked on their carne asada quesadillas. I even prefer this location to the original in Phoenix off 7th. The food was better prepared faster and fresher tasting than the other location.

I can't wait to come back again when I visit. It's a keeper!"}
{"text":"The best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Bonus: the beans are lard free! I love going to America's, the staff is nice and friendly, the atmosphere is cool, colorful and laid back. Also their chips and salsa is great, but be careful that spicy salsa is hot, hot, hot. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Super over priced for a mediocre taco,check out taco guild its wayyy better.the building is more set up for a coffee shop.i would rank them the same as El Pollo loco"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place as they have the machine to make tacos al pastor properly. The al pastor was still not authentic to what you get in Mexico. One day I hope to find my fix somewhere. Anyways horchata was good and tacos were good. The elote was great with a very spicy sauce to another it in. It's a good spot just didn't blow my mind and in Phoenix with so many great places to go it's hard to say I'll be back."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of eating two tacos for lunch today from America's Taco Shop. Let me just say that the Carne Asada taco is freaking delicious and I wish I had ordered 14 more of them. It reminds me of Big Star tacos in Chicago...mmmm. 

I also had a pastor taco. It was pretty good, but I didn't like it as much as the carne asada...maybe because I'm not a huge cilantro fan, and that was all I could taste. They put a LOT of cilantro on their pork taco. 

I was not very fond of the chips or the salsa, though. The salsa was bland and tasted like watered down V8 juice. 

Someone from the office picked up our lunch, so I can't comment on the service or the restaurant itself. But I will definitely be back for those delicious little carne asada tacos. 14 of them."}
{"text":"be careful here. this place is taking off. I went the other day and waited way too long. Try an off hour and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I wouldn't give this any stars if I could. Absolutely disgusting breakfast burrito bowl. Took forever to get our order. The beans looked like puréed baby shit & were awful. Perhaps if you don't have teeth they might be okay. But I am not ready for the nursing home yet!!!  
Scrambled eggs looked & tasted like some chemical shit storm. 
Do yourself s big favor & DO NOT eat here when at the airport. I just hope I can keep it down & dont puke on anyone."}
{"text":"There was a time before this restaurant was bought out when they had one of the best carne asada burritos in Phoenix. Sadly, this has become a chain in every sense of the word. The food is okay. The service is okay. The atmosphere is okay. If you were on a road trip and needed to eat, it's an option. Otherwise, I'd pass this by. Now, the exception to this is that there are a couple of Americas still under the original ownership. One is on 7th Street and the other is in Old Town Scottsdale. Those are still solid choices."}
{"text":"All the tables were dirty, I guess they were prepping to close.  15 minutes to get a quesadilla, and the meet was stale.  
Skip this place and get a smashburger, wildflower bakery, lots of choices...I'm thinking this is a default when the others are busy."}
{"text":"I went here twice and the food was good but a little expensive for the size. The first time I paid cash but the second time I used a brand new debitt card I never used anywhere before.The cashier said that the machine wasn't working right and like a dummy I let her wright down the number. The next morning I got a call from Chase fraud prevention it seems someone had tried to use my card # at 5 differn't places within hours after my visit to Americas Taco Shop. This was a brand new card and Americas Taco shop was the only place I ever used it and within hours I get someone trying to use my card now this tells me they are crooks or have a few crooks working for them. I will never go here again and if you do only use cash!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far since visiting from out of town.  Food was very good both times.  Corn on the cob was an excellent side...an original recipe perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the large breakfast carne asada burrito.  (Spicy )  SO damn good every to time!

Also, great customer service at this location.  Sometimes a bit understaffed it seems, but their food and friendliness make up for the wait."}
{"text":"My new favorite chicken quesadilla! Super fresh and flavorful, with just the right amount of everything. Needs a little hot sauce, but that's true with all food as far as I'm concerned. I'll definitely be back for another, probably later this week. :-)"}
{"text":"After seeing this place start to chain out everywhere I decided to give them a shot. Seems like a good idea but I left after waiting in line for too long. There was only one couple eating and 2 people ahead of me but nothing moved. I guess I wasn't in a patient mood but I had to leave frustrated. I'll give them another shot sometime. Two people working on a busy Friday night while ASU is in session won't cut it."}
{"text":"So I was craving tacos this fine Tuesday and stumbled upon America's (thanks to Yelp!). I sold my boyfriend on the idea of their Tuesday special of four tacos for $6.95 so we headed over and devoured our meal! 

We did two chicken and two al pastor tacos. 
The chicken is awesome because it's perfectly topped with their guacamole. The al pastor on the other hand, brings a fun flavor profile to the taco with the addition of pineapple. We also ordered America's Corn which is Mexican style corn on the cob and it was fresh, hot, and addicting!

My boyfriend ordered the horchata and described it as delicious, an extra kick of cinnamon and not too thick, the perfect consistency. I got to take a sip and couldn't agree more.

Lastly, the staff was super friendly! Decent prices and super casual restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for dinner, hoping to have some great tacos.
Will not be back anytime soon, I had 1 Asada taco 1 chicken,1 al pastor we also tried a quesadilla and a Carne asada  burrito. All tasted burnt. Salsas  we horrible. Check out la Frontera 1 on 16th and van buren. For real tacos thank me later."}
{"text":"Look, it's fair to have extremely low expectations for airport food in general, let alone a burrito. But this breakfast burrito made my morning. The thing i really like is that its a normal size and shape for a burrito, not some massively oversized overstuffed mess that would get all over the place when you try to eat it."}
{"text":"Tried the bean cheese burrito and the quesadilla. Bean burrito was very bland, I could have made a better one with refried beans out of a can. Salsa wasn't spicy at all and my quesadilla had little cheese. The quesadilla was good but it was more like a taco than anything, even the size was of a taco. For $4.75 I expected a bigger quesadilla. They also give you a slice of lime, radish, and cucumber... Still trying to figure that out."}
{"text":"Blah nothing special carne tacos bland. Was fresh but not much flavor. Chicken burritos same reaction blah fresh but lacking flavor."}
{"text":"OK  Our friends like it, but its not such a big deal. There are a dozen Asada tacos within 5 miles as good or better, including Ranch Market for 1/3 price. Good Guacamole"}
{"text":"A three star review is perfect for this place. Very small portions for not a small price. I keep coming back due to the lack of great mexican food options in the area. I do also like the customer service here, without it I would never come back. The three taco combo is my recommendation, but you better get something else to avoid starving and punching a co worker in a ravenous rage."}
{"text":"C was looking for a Burrito and we had a coupon for America's so why not.
We walked in and were greeted right away by the young man behind the counter. C & I checked out the menu, well, I checked out the menu. C already knew what he wanted. The facility looked nice. There were a lot of tables and everything seemed pretty clean.
C ordered the Carne Burrito ($6.29). Of course it was meat and cheese only. C said the meat tasted good although the little cubes were a little dried out. It was seasoned nicely and not overly spicy. He gave it a thumbs up. Compared to Chipotle, where would you rather go? C said here.
I ordered 3 tacos. 2 Al Pastor ($2.39 ea) and a Carne ($2.59). The Pastor was a corn tortilla with some tasty citrus marinated pork topped with tomato sauce, cilantro, chopped cabbage, fresh pineapple and a squirt of guacamole. The flavor was pretty good and the slice of pineapple was a nice add. The Carne was a corn tortilla with carne asada, guacamole, sauteed onions and minced up lettuce. The Carne was a bit dry but still had decent flavor. The onions could use a little more time on the heat as they were more translucent than caramelized.
Clean facility, nice staff, good food, fair prices. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about ATS, other than the high price to quantity ratio. It sits in a cute central phoenix location with a nice ambiance and a great patio. The food is fresh and tasty, however, portion size is rather small.

Normally I would not portion size influence my rating, but when Phoenix has an abundance of inexpensive and amazingly delicious Mexican eats around, points will have to be deducted."}
{"text":"awesome chips and salsa. try out the horchata on a hot summer day to experience a little bit of heaven."}
{"text":"This place is a favorite of mine and my little sis, a little haven for fresh mex-americano:)  

You can't go wrong with the pastor tacos, guacamole, salsa, and iced tea!  
The food is prepared very authentically, but very fresh--i love the pico de gallo they top the tacos with, and the mango salsa is fantastic!

Have to park around the corner sometimes when parking lot is full, but what are ya gonna do??  I love this place.  

There is also another one in central phx off 7th ave, better parking there...still good food!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The lunch crew is excellent--front of house staff is courteous and friendly and the food is delicious. I love the bean and cheese burrito and al pastor taco. The food is consistently well prepared and priced well."}
{"text":"New owners. Service is SLOW. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and carne asada torta. The quesadilla came out eventually, and was cold. The torta followed a few minutes later, and was fresh and good but lacking the \"Americas style\" addition of jalapeños that we paid for. They no longer serve margaritas (server said they're working on it). This America's location is nothing like it was a year or so ago. I won't return. Too many better options out there."}
{"text":"I come to America's strictly for their beans but want to stop coming here because of their staff.  This review is several months in the making, I have a 30 min lunch break so time is of the essence when it comes to getting food.  I will place an online order 30+ min in advance, only to get there and find it has not been made or even started cooking yet. Queue a 10-20 min wait while they prepare it and most of my lunch is down the toilet.  My coworker has even resorted to typing \"please make sure food is ready on time\" in the special instructions notes on the online ordering form.

Besides the long prep time, orders have been incorrect, items have been left out, it takes 4 or 5 times of repeat spelling of my name for them to start my order (S as in Sam, E-R-I), and most recently the to go lid was loose on my beans and most of them ended up inside the to go bag.  Wait you say, wouldn't gravity stop the beans from leaking?  Not when the server places the to go container on its side in the bag instead of right side up.  I now have a nice oil stain on my front seat from the leak.  The place is hardly busy so being in the weeds is not a plausible excuse.

Either better train your employees, or find competent staff.  Tacos are not Rock Science."}
{"text":"Love this place! The carne asada really is without a doubt the best in town. I am also pretty crazy about the salsa! YUM! The breakfast burritos are petty amazing to. Yes, I have eaten breakfast lunch and dinner here, all in the same day! :-)"}
{"text":"I personally love Americas Taco shop. I agree with other reviewers that there are other locations that are better, but this one is still good. There bean and cheese burrito is better than any other Mexican restaurant I've ever had, and their green sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"Wanted nachos but they are only at the Chase Field location. The carne asada taco was delicious, the chicken taco didn't have much flavor, I liked both salsa's but the chips were crap."}
{"text":"Not all America's Tacos Shops are created equal...but this location is by far the best!! We've been ordering a lot through Ubereats...the order is always correct, even with special requests and it's always delicious. If you are going to try America's Taco Shop, this is the one to try!!"}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food in Scottsdale. Went to try this place with a friend and saw great reviews. Walked in and was pleasantly surprised that the shop was clean and trendy. Ordered a carne asada burrito and a quesadilla and my friend did the same. 

After modifying my burrito order the manager mocked me by stating that I had taken all the flavor out of my food. As a native Arizonan I know what good Mexican food is and what flavors I want. Immediately dropped this place a star for bad customer service.

Next after a 20 minute wait we got our order and asked for salsa. They were reluctant to give more than 1 sauce without more pushing from me for more sauce.

Drive home to find they left half our order out. Had to drive back to get my order in full that they charged me for. They did NOTHING to compensate me for my time and their error. 

In a competitive market for Mexican food attention to detail counts and they FAIL! Never going back, save your money the food was average!"}
{"text":"Went here on the suggestion from Georgie M, a fellow yelper..   Man was he right.. these Taco's and Quesadilla's are great !   The El Pastor Quesadilla I had was very tasty.. not overwhelming.. not your normal \"mexican food\".    fresh ingredients with limes and vegetables...  REAL \"Street Style\" Mexican Food...  not something smothered in cheese and a flag stuck in it.   Happy Hour to boot.  The store was nicely decorated and very clean.  open kitchen so you can see your food being prepared..  The quac and salsa was wonderful.   You want some real mexcian food at a great price and a cold pacifico to go with it.. here's your spot.   interesting location too.. easy to find.. right off the 101 in a little strip mall.  This is an amazing success story and their story is right on the wall.."}
{"text":"My neighbor asked if I wanted something from this place, and because I was starving, I said yes. I asked for a bean and cheese burrito. He asked if I wanted regular or extra large. Regular it was. Boy, was that a mistake! While I really liked the taste of the beans and cheese, the size of the burrito was laughable. They should call it a mini burrito, or put it on their childs menu, if they have one. $3.50 isn't a lot of money, but it is when you feel ripped off."}
{"text":"The 4 star rating is for the food, because it is delicious! However I would give 2 and a half stars for the price because I cannot leave without spending $15 every time. ( the food is worth it I suppose) and I alternate between 2 and 4 stars for the service. Because depending on the time of day and who is working you will receive wonderful service or terrible service. I think the staff in the evenings needs to be evaluated, however as a whole it is great food. And the environment is clean."}
{"text":"First time today... finally -- i've been wanted to check out, but just have never ventured over. 

Met my friend Jack, of Social Latte, today for our take on \"America's Taco Shop\". 

I didn't consult the yelp reviews first of what to order, but decided that I may as well try a few tacos since that's the name of the place. I had the Carne Asada taco and the El Pastor taco. Of the two, the El Pastor was (IMO) wow!! I loved the sweet flavor of the pork. The carne asada was definitely alright but not as tasty as the El Pastor - - get that if you like/eat pork. 

Chips and salsa - - $1.50. We did get one friendly refill. 

But... today was one of those perfect weather days in Phoenix, where it's basically required to eat outside. So Jack and I enjoyed some rays out on their patio - - it was awesome! I felt as though I was back in Southern California somewhere. 

Yeah... a bit on the pricey side for a Mexican taco joint. $1.50 for a can of soda.... my total for soda, chips & salsa, and 2 tacos was $8.50. Oh well... I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"This is a really great little taco shop. I haven't been here too much and haven't tried all their menu yet, but what I have had been really tasty. Nothing mind blowing hence the 4 stars, but you definitely can't go wrong.

I would definitely recommend trying the Al Pastor meat. It's something I haven't seen anywhere else and never tasted anything like it. Very interesting and delicious! The prices are also pretty affordable."}
{"text":"It was a good lunch.  I had, by recommendation the carne asada quesadilla, a taco and the chips and salsa.  It was all good, my favorite was the salsa.  The space is your becoming more and more typical, renovated home.  The lunch line was short and it moved fast, I'll be sure to visit again soon."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of their tacos and the guac sauce on them.  They were \"okay\" but I've had much better in the valley.  I did enjoy their quirky art/building and patio.  I bet it could be fun to come here for happy hour on a Friday when it's busy.  Food just wasn't the best in my opinion."}
{"text":"So I think I am a taco addict. But no need for intervention.... I come here quite often and every time it is just wonderful! I am almost embarrassed to go here because I think the people who work here remember me.... but that can't keep me away from the taco goodness. 

So the carne asada is wonderful, but I have found it to be much more wonderful on the vampiro. The vampiro is a masterpiece. It is like a tostada, in that it has a crunchy tortilla as a base. Then it is topped with caramelized onion, lettuce, guac, Carne asada, and maybe cilantro or something? Add some extra spicy salsa and I am a very happy girl. 

In addition, I was scared to try the al pastor for awhile, and then I tried it and realized the wonder of their pork. Wow. It is good. They have it on a rotating stick, almost like gyro meat, with a chunk of pineapple on top... with the pineapple juice just dripping onto the pork. One time we went and they were out of pork and I almost cried. No joke. It is that good. I get it on a taco, which has a slice of the pineapple (best topping), guac, onion, and cilantro. super yum. 

The extra spicy salsa is really good. It is the perfect amount of spicy to make my nose run a little. It also tastes incredibly fresh, like everything here. 

This is the kind of place where I tell a friend I went here and they are sad that I didn't bring them....So go here.... Go here right now!"}
{"text":"This location is very good! The tacos al pastor are full of flavor, just like the other locations. I tried the cochata (coffee with horchata) the last time I went....Ridic! This stuff is so good! I would drink this on a daily basis. Props to whoever came up with that!"}
{"text":"I love America's Tacos!!!! I go to the one by ASU all the time.... way too much actually. The BF gets jealous when I go without him... that's how good it is. So yesterday when I was shopping with my friend at AZ mills (nine west outlet FTW), I remembered seeing that a location had opened here on FB the other day. So we went to the food court, and there was the America's tacos. This is awesome considering the nastiness that passes for food in most malls. I decided to try something new yesterday, which may have been a bad decision on my part, and got the carne asada torta with extra spicy salsa. I felt like this was not the best thing I have had from this restaurant. I know the salsa was much more mild than it has been at other locations. I think next time I will stick with the tacos, burritos, or vampiros (the tostada of the future....mmmm), although, the place just opened, so there may be some kinks still there to work out. My friend got what I would normally get, a carne asada burrito and an al pastor taco and said it was super delicious. We shared some chips and salsa, again the salsa wasn't really spicy (especially for extra spicy) and the chips were stale! So that was sad. Also, no happy hour or daily specials at this location, at least not yet, and, of course, no alcohol. I am really happy for America and her husband to open another shop, especially in such a good food lacking place like AZ mills.... but I will probably continue going to the ASU location."}
{"text":"Love it!  The carne asada is so good in my opinion.  The shop is cute also, not much seating but if you don't go at prime time you will not have a problem.  I ate here twice last week because I was craving it so much!
I also really liked their salsa and chips, more the salsa, and they keep it in the fridge so its super cold when they give it to you which I really like.  I just have had the quesadilla with carne asada so I can't say anything else about the rest of the food.  They could give you a bigger piece of lime with your meal though! :)"}
{"text":"I love America's.  I usually always visit the Melrose location and have gave it a 5 star review on here.  Went to this location for the first time in a long time last Saturday.  Boy was that a mistake.  The food was good, as usual, but the service was horrible.  We didn't even get a hello when we walked in and no one else was in there.  They really seemed like they didn't even want to take our order or talk to us.  No eye contact, no pleasantries, nothing.  I will not go back to this location.  Such a difference between the 2 locations!  Every time we go to Melrose they are awesome and know that we are regulars."}
{"text":"Loved the carne, hated the seating arrangement. 

We hit the Coronado location today for lunch and despite planning our meet for 11:30 to increase our chances of landing a table inside we were diverted to Patio City. Huge bummer.

The burrito was all kinds of delicious (and the portion is perfect, unlike the 'roided up burritos found at Qdoba, Chipotle and even Chico's) but sitting at a rock hard, scorching hot picnic table took a bit of the enjoyment away from the experience. 

I understand the converted house is tiny (and that's part of charm), but would investing in some misters downgrade the authenticity? I think not. 

Also, I'm not against any Green initiatives, but delivering food baskets sans napkins is a bad move.

I'll definitely go back for the carne, but probably not anytime before late October."}
{"text":"i love the mexican food in phoenix. ATS doesn't live up.  Great happy hour (beginning at 2pm - to attract all those day drinkers who are 300 feet away on campus). i had the pastor (pork) burrito. the description sounded delicious (guac, pineapple, cilantro), and it tasted like all shredded pork and salsa. it needed more stuffing!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time this place was probably awesome. That fairytale ended & turned into a vegetarian's nightmare. CHICKEN!!! In my veggie quesadilla. Chips stale, bland beans. It was awful. Never again! The End"}
{"text":"Date of Visit: 7/27/13
Party size: 2

Venue: it's inside and old house so it's not very big which is not really an issue but was warm (small window AC trying to cool the whole place) and the fan above us wasn't working. 

Food:  order 2 chicken tacos and 3 ceviche tostadas. 

Tacos were below average.  Chicken was dry and certain bites required really chewing the hard chicken. 

Tostadas: tostadas itself were stale and ceviche was decent.  It lacked salt and was overly spicy. 

Service: hostess was nice and service was fine. 


Would I return?  No."}
{"text":"NOT impressed.  My order took forever because they basically lost it.  Won't go into the details, but it was poorly handled on several levels.  Not a good start.  They just opened, so I'd give them a pass, if the food had made up for it.  But, sadly, it fell short.

My 2 carne asada tacos?  Meh.  Poor value - very small tacos, generic store-like tiny tortillas, very thin, that probably should have been doubled up.  Small-to-moderate quantity of meat, which wasn't so lean and seemed of lower quality.  Nice seasoning helped, but meat was still lacking.  Lousy value - the tacos were something like $2.79 each, vs $1.29 for street tacos at Los Taquitos, which are FAR superior.  This was more of a snack than a meal.  Not bad, but not all that good, especially for the price.  Probably won't be back, too many better options in the area."}
{"text":"I was halfway through drinking my horchata when I felt something on my lip and when I pulled it out of the straw it was a few inch long black hair (I'm blonde so it definitely wasn't mine). The straws come wrapped in paper and since I had been drinking the horchata for awhile before I saw the hair, it had to have come from the horchata. So disgusting!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere, food, and location, this place has it all! If you are looking for a low key Mexican food restaurant in Scottsdale with excellent food this is your place!!! I will be frequenting this spot!!"}
{"text":"I read the menu and the egg and potato burrito sounded amazing!  eggs, potatoes, fire roasted salsa, jack cheese and home-made beans?  That was perfect since what I really wanted was a bean and cheese burrito with potatoes in it.

First off, this burrito was SMALL.  S. M. ALL!
 
Secondly, where were my beans?  Where was my fire roasted salsa?  Where were my potatoes?  Oh, wait, there are my potatoes--little flecks among the egg.

The third problem was the deal breaker.

My mini-burrito
 dripped a ton of liquid all over me, my desk, everything.


NASTY!  AVOID!!!  YUCKY!!!"}
{"text":"Great place! Delicious tacos. The horchata is the best and free refills - even better! Service was awesome and helpful.  The 4447 7th is closed, we drove a couple more mile up the road to 20"}
{"text":"First time to an America's Taco. I wasn't impressed.   I will say the Horchata was delicious.
The service was okay, the cashier was knowledgeable but they were out of Pastor so I got two Carne Asada tacos in the trio.  

I was told the Carne Asada is usually really good, but it was a little dry and over cooked.  Maybe it was just this location.  I might try another location because I love Tacos!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place to anyone that likes to eat mexican food. Who eats mexican food without sour cream!? negative 5 thumbs down. 
keep driving might as well go right down the street to filibertos and get twice as full for your moneys worth"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant searching on the yelp web page and I'm glad I did! I came here with a co worker and we enjoyed the food.

I got a carne asada burro which was pretty good. The tortilla was warm and delicious and the pico inside was also great. The only thing I wish was a little different was larger chunks of meat, which is probably a personal preference. 

What was really delicious was the Horchata. Oh man, so so so good. I want to go back here again (secretly for the horchata) but would try something else, just to experience something different.

Overall, I would definitely recommend America's Taco Shop. Good food at very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Love their food. The only reason I don't give five stars is that the amount of food you get totally varies from visit to visit. The size of the burritos can vary by 50-60%. Makes it hard to know how much food to order, but it is very delicious food, service is great."}
{"text":"I. Love. Their. Horchata. It's the best I've ever had.
Their tacos are decent, but not to the point that I rave like everyone else. 
I'm so glad they are still in this location. I lived in Melrose for 4 years and saw 3 different restaurants in that building in that time. It's like cursed or something. Maybe it WAS cursed until America moved in? Wouldn't that be crazy?
Anyway, the staff is friendly. I do think the portions are a bit small for the price, but she's got a following and can charge a bit more.
I love riding my bike here, pounding down some tacos and horchata, then pedaling back home for a food come nap."}
{"text":"Yes, the bean and cheese burrito was good.  Yes, I'm glad they don't use lard (then it's vegetarian).  It was hot and cheesy.  But, it was just beans and cheese.  Nothing fancy.  I won't rave over it.
The chips and salsa were OK.  I would have liked more salsa, but since you have to pay extra to get them in the first place, I didn't want to get charged more.
The highlight of dinner?  The horchata!  I even got a refill to go as I left.
I will probably go back, but I won't be craving it."}
{"text":"A great place to get a delicious authentic Mexican meal in Phoenix. I had the tacos al pastor, elote corn, carne asada tacos, chips and guacamole, salsa, and refried beans. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"I love going to this little taco shop for happy hour. Their pork tacos are the best. the have a really good variety of different types of Mexican food and tasty salsa  as well!!! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place has occupied the unfortunate corner of short-lived restaurants. There is nothing worse than giving a place a chance, getting attached to it and then it shutting down shortly thereafter. Luckily, America's Taco Shop has a loyal following and I sincerely hope it stays put in the 7th Ave location. Last night was my 4th time here and it grows on me more and more. Had I wrote this review the first time I went (7th St location), I think I would have given it 3 stars. I mean, to state that it has the best carne asada? I still wouldn't go that far but I always enjoy my food. Last night, I had a carne asada taco, pastor taco, and chips/salsa/guacamole. I love pastor tacos but am not a fan of theirs. They add pineapple to theirs which is my thing. I love pineapple alone, not warm with food. Again, not my thing. I have had their carne asada tostada in the past. I was a little turned by the warm, wilted lettuce on top but I guess that is what happens when it is wrapped with foil. But the tostada was okay. Their bean and cheese burritos are awesome. It is so simple but the flavor is really good...love it. I haven't eaten there in person (we always get take-out) but from the outside, the restaurant is adorable and oh-so inviting. My daughter's day care is right across the street and this place is always busy. Good sign...."}
{"text":"XL bean burrito, no cheese, add guacamole and grilled jalapenos = yum. The fresh brewed iced tea is delicious and comes in a giant cup with free refills. Love this place for a quick tasty meal."}
{"text":"The NEW America's Taco Shop  opened today and I was the first most #1 customer.

As usual I had the Carne Asada Torta and it was fantastic.

So good in fact that I went back and got a Carne Asada Burrito to go for dinner (which also makes me the first repeat customer).

Great new location on 7th Ave just south of Campbell."}
{"text":"I eat Beef!  I love the stuff.
Especially Carne Asada and today I had America's Carne Adada.
It rocked.  Especially with the addition of a little lime juice that the Carne Asada comes with.

Cute little place with a no-nonsense menu.
They make what the like to make and are good at it.
Don't need anything else.

Support local business, America's is on my list."}
{"text":"I've been fixated on finding my go-to Mexican place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area for a while now.  I came across this place under recommendations from people.  I've also had warnings from others not to go to this place, but I decided to disregard those warnings.

Anyway, I went to this establishment on my lunch break and ordered the Al Pastor burrito.  The meat was delicious and the other stuff that came with made the burrito very flavorful.

My only complaint--does it really have to be $6 for a thinly-wrapped burrito???  I feel ripped off."}
{"text":"Pros:
~This place is known for their carne asada, but for me, the main attraction is that it's one of the only places where you can get authentic al pastor tacos in the metropolitan Phoenix area. And HOMBRE are they good! 
~Their beans are amazing, too, elevating a simple bean and cheese burrito to a whole new level in flavor! 
~ America's corn is divine as well.

The cons: 
~ The portions are too small for the price. By the time you order enough food to fill up, you've blown your lunch budget for the next couple of days. Don't even bother ordering the happy hour dollar-sized street tacos. They meant to call them \"silver dollar tacos\" because the tortilla is the size of a silver dollar coin, making the taco only two bites at most. You have to order a dozen to make it a meal, and then it's no longer a deal. 
~ The Tempe location is way too small during the warm months when it's too hot to sit outside, and the inside does have 'hole in the wall' unpleasant smell. 

Despite these flaws (which is why I cannot give ATS 5 stars), I cannot stay away for long. The pastor tacos call to me in my sleep and give me uncontrollable cravings that I give in to at least a time or two a month. So worth it!"}
{"text":"Just visited America's again tonight for my third visit.  I'd say it's time for a review:

I love this place.  This corner spot has run through so many restaurants and finally they have one that is going to stick!  I've always gone on Thursday nights so I can't say what it's like on other nights or days of the week.  I've run into friends each time I've ventured in for my hour-long stay.  I've also chatted up perfect strangers - frankly, that's not so unusual for me though so I won't go on.  Suffice it to say it's a friendly neighborhood joint.  Tonight's special was Burro de pastor.  A marinated and grilled pork with guacamole, pineapple, cilantro and other tasty bits.  My 3 year old, 5 year old and 45 year old husband loved them.  We also had the Vampiro which was delicious too.  A corn tortilla with the pastor pork, guacamole & caramelized onions mmmmm.  Kids also order the fail-safe quesadilla.  It's good - how bad can cheese in a flour tortilla be?  Thing is, I don't want to order quesadillas for my kids.  The last time I was there we had the carne asada--my husband and I both love it, the kids didn't love it.  The pastor is ideal for them though, a little sweet and a lot of savory.

The staff are all very friendly and helpful.

Enjoy it"}
{"text":"Glad I tried this place!

We are always craving Mexican but have a hard time finding a place that isn't greasy or too busy. Gave America's Tacos a try and so happy I did. 

Chips and salsa were fabulous to start. Carne Asada deserves the award it won in 2008 because it was good! 

I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars because food is ok not all that for 15$ I didn't even get full! Not coming here again. Ta carbon has way better quality tacos and Mexican dishes."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a few years. It has slowly gotten worse and worse. The food is relatively consistent. Just medium quality over priced Mexican food. But it is convenient for me. Unfortunately the last 4 times I have either ordered takeout or delivery there have been problem with the order. Excuses made, very little effort to be better or make things right. It's sad to see a business go down hill like this. Do not order online! From any service as they do not know how to process. Especially grub hub who they advertise as their go to!?!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest but definitely a place you would take someone you want to introduce to a misrepresentation of what street tacos should be .. There is hardly any flavor developed bland at best.. The salsa tastes like it's fresh from a can or packet like the salsa they serve at Taco Bell..."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites for tacos. I always get the carne asada tacos. The topping is amazing.. guac and shredded lettuce.. yum! I always add on a bean and cheese burrito. I tried their salsa for the first time yesterday and it is delicious as well. They also have that really cool Coke machine for the kids- and me! I'm soo happy they opened near my house and I don't have to trek up to 7th street for America's!"}
{"text":"An dear old high school friend's daughter suggested this for lunch the other day while I was in Phoenix for my thirty-year reunion (Wow, I'm getting old!!).

So...eight of us dropped in for lunch, and I wasn't disappointed.

It's a small place, but there's  a nice little patio outside, and the employees are very pleasant.

I had a carne asada burrito at my friend's daughter's suggestion.  It was quite tasty.  

I recommend this place if you're in the area.  A very nice little place to visit for a quick bite of yummy."}
{"text":"Guess I should have read the reviews before coming to this overly priced, tiny portion place..

The vampiro as they call it was 4.50 and was about 3 1/2 inches in diameter tostada, barely anything on it and not so good tasting either. 

What a freakin rip off. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE... unless you enjoy throwing your money away..


Negative 5 stars..."}
{"text":"Very good carne asada and bean n cheese burritos.  Fast n friendly service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.  Some of the best guacamole I've had. I think everything else is a bit pricey for what you receive portionwise but it is yummy."}
{"text":"Staff was great but tacos were less than average. If you're looking for authentic street tacos with hardly anything in them then this is your place! It wasn't awful, but I thought there would be more to the tacos."}
{"text":"I'm glad this place is not closer to my house or i'd be there way too much.  The chorizo breakfast burrito is awesome, Carne Asada tacos are also really good, and the horchata was tasty.  Restaurant is very clean, and service is good."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of ATS, but I'm always sticker shocked at how expensive it is when everything adds up, and it takes quite a while to get the food.  It's good, but with the zillion other taco places around, I think I'd rather try out a new place.  Maybe if they run a deal on Groupon, Living Social, or Voice I'd head there again."}
{"text":"I went out to lunch here with some friends today. I have to agree with some of the previous ratings and say that this place has zero value. I got the Combo #1 (one of each of the three kinds of tacos).

My big complaint is what you get for what you pay. The combo was like 8 bucks, which I guess was fine until the guy asked me if I wanted a cup for water. I was like, \"Seriously, it doesn't come with a drink??\". So that was the first thing. After a while, the tacos come out and they're tiny! Not a ton of meat and not very flavorful, even with the huge amount of so-so guac they heap on there.

Honestly people, you can do better than this for lunch. Avoid."}
{"text":"carne asada is really really good. i like it best in the burrito form. i rarely enjoy any beef dishes at mexican joints. usually, its chewy, tasteless and greasy. the carne asada here is none of those things. i love the pastor tacos as well. just like \"tacos and beer\" taco shop in acapulco. the only thing i wished is that the pastor had a better crust on it. it is supposed to spin on the spit like a gyro and have a crunch to it, but it really doesn't. its worth getting the chips and salsa. the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Am I missing something here? I've actually been back to America's. Twice after my first visit, convinced that I had accidentally gone to the wrong America's or perhaps stumbled into a nearby taco shop on 7th. 

Alas, the helpful Yelp photo informs me that I have, in fact, now eaten three times at the Famous America's Taco Shop.

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

I'm still on my quest for the Best Burrito in Maricopa County, I'll let you know when I find it fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"After spending a splendid afternoon strolling along Mill Ave, my boyfriend and I abandoned an idea to go to Buffalo Wild Wings on Rural instead opting for America's. And Boy what a great decision! 
The beers were cheap, 2 bucks a bottle, and the limes were fresh! You order inside at a register and when your order is ready someone brings it out to you. I ordered a carne asada Vampiro to share. The customer service was great, not afraid to talk with customers and describe the dishes. 
3.75 for the Vampiro, which is basically a tostada piled high with fresh ingredients. It was delicious!
Added bonus America's serves an Horchata iced coffee. Dream come true!!"}
{"text":"I was so hungry after attempting to waste time downtown between meetings (aka window shopping).  I wanted to treat myself to lunch, but did not want a super long wait (it was lunch time), and also didn't want to drop a ton of cash...and I wanted something delicious!

That's when I remembered that I had heard great things about America's Taco Shop (America, by the way is the name of one of the owners, it is not a reference to our continent).  It seems everyone has been hearing great things about America's Taco Shop--I even heard some guys there talking about how it really has blown up (thanks to yelp and news reviews) and that there even is another location in the works.

I got a bean and cheese no-lard (good!) burrito.  I got the regular size which was perfect and chips and salsa.  It was SO GOOD...creamy bean and cheese...mmm...I really should not write reviews while I'm hungry...I'm too tempted to go down there immediately...anyway...

The prices are great, the salsa is to die for (spicy, pureed almost, really great--perfect on the chips).  There wasn't a crazy line (though I make no promises, this place is popular and there was a longer line when I left).  Parking was slightly cramped, but especially decent for downtown.

There is seating outside on a fun large patio enclosure.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to you.  It's a great place to go and eat Mexican food without feeling like you just blew your morning at the gym...that is, unless you overeat by ordering every item on the menu--which you might be tempted to do, everything's so good."}
{"text":"My visit was frustrating first of all because there was zero parking, and I had to walk two blocks in the heat, hoping it would be worth the discomfort.  Well, it wasn't.  Quite simply, no one was particularly helpful when I ordered, in spite of the afternoon being pretty quiet.  (only a couple of other diners)  The beverage that I opted to try, Agua Fresca, was far too sweet for me and I didn't take more than two sips of it.  My Carne Asada Vampiro didn't even look appetizing.  I knew before I even took a bite that the meat was completely dried out, and there wasn't much flavor.  I wonder that they bothered to serve it since it LOOKED so dry.  Clearly someone didn't care about the product being given to customers.  In the end, I tossed pretty much everything and went elsewhere to eat.  I won't be going back.  It was a poor experience."}
{"text":"Its really great to have ATS right by my house now! We had the vampiros al pastor, chicken tacos, chips and salsa and a bean and cheese burrito. All fabulous. Ice tea was also great. But, the thing i love about it here is the incredibly friendly service. I specifically asked her name because she was just so damn nice. She brought us mire chips without asking, checked on us a couple of times just because she was passing by and really knew the menu which was helpful to my friends that had never eaten here. So, thank you Sage. It makes a delicious meal even better when someone like you goes above and beyond."}
{"text":"My favorite is the pastor tacos! The bowls are also delicious!!! The staff is always so friendly and they have HAPPY hour all week. Food is always fresh!! And they have free wifi"}
{"text":"Parking is a bitch, but this place is worth it! This place, scratch that, ALL their locations, are absurdly busy at lunch time, but it beats the usual downtown lunch grinds. 7th Ave location also has a great outdoor patio, so perfect for the unbeatable valley weather. Misters will be on full blast during the summer. Inside, it's a bit cramped, so I always try to sit outside (unless it's 110 out). 

Love love love the Al Pastor tacos, and their chips and salsa are also great! Mexican cokes, HELL YA. Carne asada is dope. The beans are also legit. They also have some pretty good ceviche and margaritas. Happy hour here is worth a check out. 

**Secret menu item- America's Favorites. Great for 2 people, gets you 2 al pastor tacos and 2 burritos. You can also substitute for whatever meat you want. Add in 2 drinks and it's ~$20."}
{"text":"holy horchata.

i always say, there's no better way to try a beverage for the first time, than to drink an entire gallon of it. and trying the horchata at america's was no exception. 

i had no idea what to expect, but immediately fell in love with it. all gallon of it. second best thing to drink, next to beer, with mexican food. so, so good.

the carne asada burrito was one of the best i've ever had. ever. the beef was just so good, tasty, tender, and loads of it. the tortillas were incredible; just right so they didn't take over the burrito, but added to the flavor.

the ceviche was awesome; chopped up like salsa...whatever they do to it works. big time. it's 10:17am and i'd eat a bowl of it now...for breakfast...with milk and a spoon. 

i had two different types of salsa and i loved both equally. the only reason i'm giving it 4 starts is that the veggie quesadilla was pretty far below the rest of the food. basically, it was like they put quac, shredded lettuce, and a sliced up cucumber in a tortilla and threw it in the micro. you know how all of those vegetables are all kind of the same color; blah green? that's how i'd describe the taste: blah green. 

but everything else was incredible. you can eat like a king for around $20 and by like a king i mean, two burritos, chips and salsa, quesadilla, and a couple of horchatas. 

next time i'm sitting on the front porch. so all of 7th can watch me feed my face, cookie monster style."}
{"text":"The way they make their guacamole here is sooo delicious. I think I am becoming addicted to it.  I am a vegetarian, so it's nice to find something I can eat out if I am with someone who is not a vegetarian. I also like their cerviche once in a while -- it is very refreshing and fresh tasting!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place a thousand times and always wanted to try it. Finally I did today and I was disappointed. The staff was very nice and the location is great. Since its \"America's Taco Shop\" I ordered the three assorted taco plate with some chips & salsa. All the meat was super dry and overall pretty tasteless. The food came out super quick, which is good from a service perspective, but I knew the food had probably been cooked earlier & sitting there for a while. As I ate each taco my intuition was right as it just tasted like re-heated meat and not much flavor with it. The chips weren't too fresh but not bad. The best part of the meal was the salsa as that was very good, but not enough to get me to go back. The service & the salsa kept this review at a 2-star instead of a 1-star.

I left thinking that this could be an amazing place because of the location and the patio, but the food was just disappointing. I would have to know that they upgraded their food in order for me to ever go back again."}
{"text":"I visited the new location on 16th St and Camelback and ordered the carne asada and al Pastor tacos.  The asada was truly tasteless and the lettuce so finely minced it seemed pre-chewed.  The al Pastor was slightly more flavorful when lots of salsa added.  The roasted jalapeño was served ice cold.  Really terrible experience."}
{"text":"Went here with my family before a spring training game and had a good meal. They have street tacos and burritos, and also a nice selection of beverages including horchata. No churros though."}
{"text":"\"You had me at Cochata.\"

Good early morning breakfast stop in Phoenix, breakfast burritos were great and hit the spot. So good I ate two of them.

Also try the Cochata, a coffee and Horchata mix better than any milkshake frappacino you'll get at Starbucks."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Always a warm welcome and cool atmosphere. Make sure you to say what's up to Stephanie if you catch her working, she makes the place that even better with her hospitality. Americas  is the Business!!"}
{"text":"America's Taco Shops have great atmosphere. Their food is super, and I love it when they have specials.  The chips and salsa, delicious. And the people are always nice here.  The only drawback is that they don't stay open super late. :(  So I gotta get there early!"}
{"text":"Not anything like the original. Ordered a carne asada burrito, she rang it up as a breakfast burrito, refunded my money, made a new transaction for a carne asada burrito, and when I got home bit into a breakfast burrito. Great. Now I paid nine bucks for a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Bean & Cheese Burrito is a winner here, as are the breakfast burritos in the morning.  Service is fairly fast and there's ample parking at this location.

A few gripes...  

1.  None of the salsas are \"hot\".  Not even the \"extra hot\" one.  They need to rename those, or actually make them at least a little bit hot.
2.  The chips & salsa ratio is seriously way off.  Few chips with a rather large salsa portion. 
3.  The miniature salsa portion with the burritos is a joke, especially since chips do not come with the burrito like they do at some alternative places like Rubios and such.  Even if someone wanted to dip their burrito into the miniature cup, it is too small, and the portion is too small to be of much use for gently adding it to one's burrito as it is eaten.
4.  Adding onto #3 above, why not just add chips to the burrito order so the salsa isn't so lonely, or take away the salsa and drop the prices by 20 cents or so?"}
{"text":"Horrible Service, Horrible Food, I was told it was the best but that person must of not eatn for days, you know when your hungry dirt taste good and i would have rather eatn dirt then this supposed Mexican food."}
{"text":"I had a craving for a carne asada burrito classic with Jalapenos. So on my way home I swung by to snag one.. I walked into this location to find 2 girls sitting at a table. One was sleeping the other was playing on her phone. Once I got to the counter the one playing on her phone got up and got behind the register.... I almost died laughing inside, since the other girl barely lifted her head to see who I was. She had a super hungover look on her face and just figured she was a friend of the cell phone girl.. I ordered my food and hung out. Sleeping beauty gets up and goes to the back to help make my burrito!!! Dude your sleeping on the clock and in front of customers!!! I felt like I annoyed them by craving a burrito. After getting my food I jammed out and it still tasted super delicious. So I still gotta give them that. 3 Stars is all I can muster up for these 2 girls that would rather be anywhere else but helping me kill my craving...."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the simple bean and cheese burritos, homemade, no crap in them and everything a bean and cheesier should be. I need to wean myself from having too many, I don't want to get sick of them ...savor the love. I've had the carne Asada and Pastor Taco's both are ridiculously yummy as well."}
{"text":"This place is right down the road from my office so we decided to try it for lunch. Right off the bat points for very friendly service. We were able to put in our order right away and the food came up fast.

The food was ok but there's room for improvement. I have no complaints except the flavor and spiciness was lacking. I covered my food in the spicy salsa, and even that seemed mild. Overall it's a bit too americanized for my liking, but still not a bad place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Mexican style tacos, Tortas, and other Mexican fare but inside a chain restaurant. I love that you can get horchata and the guacamole is better than most Mexican traditional restaurants and I can't complain about the tacos...better than average. Salsa is pretty bomb (amazing!)! Would go there again but wish it was cheaper"}
{"text":"Wanted tacos for dinner, so we checked out this place. Didn't want a chain bot something more authentic. Americas tacos does have several locations, but I would say the food is very authentic. Chips and salsa are good also

Tacos were very tasty! Originally ordered 3 steak tacos and ended ordering 3 more because they were so good. Wife also liked her steak quesadilla. 

Ordered a small and large margarita, those were a little pricey but they were decent.

They have a small inside eating area but a large patio.

One drawback was the restaurant has posted hours of closing at 9 pm but closed at 8.

Great taco place in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Never been so disappointed in tacos than I was eating here. I got the \"everyone loves this\" taco trio and bluck. The pork was dry. The carne asada had nothing but fat and the chicken had no flavor. Everything about these tacos were bland, boring and not worth the price. First time ever has become the last time ever. The place itself has a great patio and service, sadly the food sucks."}
{"text":"I stopped in here to get a breakfast burrito this morning because I was hungry before my flight. I took it to-go with the intention of eating it at the gate or on the plane if need be. I forgot about having to go thru security first, though. I asked a TSA agent if it would be ok to bring the burrito thru and they said sure, just keep it out of my bag. Nevertheless, it set off the xray machine and I had to wait for it to be inspected by another agent. The guy was cool about it. Basically he just said \"yup, it is a breakfast burrito alright\" and let me thru. But it would have been faster to just eat it there at the restaurant prior going thru security due to the extra time I spent waiting for that \"burrito inspection\". Ah well, at least I have wi-fi on my plane now so I can tell you all about it. The burrito I got was the ranchero. It was very tasty but I bit soggy. I get it that it has pico de gallo salsa mixed it but they need to cook some of the water out of the vegetables before mixing in the eggs and wrapping it up. It hit the spot though and I had decent service so I'm still giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Carne asada burrito.  I've been going to America's for years and don't even know what else is on the menu.  This carne asada will turn vegans into meat-eaters in one single bite. It... is... amazing. (Just thinking about it is literally making my mouth water right now!)"}
{"text":"This place is BOMBTASTIC! The carne asada is GRILLED to perfection, seasoned well!

It comes in a Burrito or Torta form.  You can't go wrong as the menu is very specific to only carne asada! Hehehehe.

Go get some!!! Seriously!!"}
{"text":"I remember when America's opened, back in 2008.  I was so excited to have found this place, I told all my friends and family, they ended up loving it too. We would come here a couple of times a week for years, i CRAVED this place!!! 

The prices have always been a bit pricey but the food was delicious, so I didn't care.  I remember, when they first opened, the portions were huge, almost annoyingly so, two hands just could not hold the burritos together, hey, not complaining, I loved how generous they were with their portions and again...the food...delicious!!   

My favorite thing on the menu was their bean and cheese burrito and chips and salsa.  I tried everything on the menu but this was my absolute favorite.  Normally, I don't like refried beans (when I go out for Mexican, I always sub extra rice for the beans).  I knew it was amazing when I realized my favorite menu item was something I normally disliked. 

Then, they opened the one on 7th ave and then one in Tempe. I was thrilled they were doing so well, I did not want this place to go under!! I noticed gradually through the years, the portion sizes had become smaller and smaller, still didn't care...delicious. 

THEN, out of the blue, I lost my taste for it.  I just figured i was eating it too often and just needed a break.  I went back months later, excited again, but no, the same thing.  I waited longer this time, thinking it was just me... still wasn't loving it.  It made no sense, I could not figure out how i went from craving this food to not enjoying it anymore.  I would give it a try every so often and always ended up feeling the same way, confused and underwhelmed.  Prices were going up, burritos were getting smaller, new stores were opening up on Camelback and in Scottsdale and I just wasn't loving it.  

Then, last year, I gave it another shot... while standing in line, reading through the menu, I noticed  the bean burritos were made with jack cheese!!! Here's thing, they used to be made with cotija and it literally made the burrito.  The jack cheese just made it taste like every other ok burrito with minimal flavor.  When I noticed that, I asked if they could sub cotija for the jack and they said they don't have cotija.  I mentioned, it used to be made with cotija and she said not for the 3 or 4 years she had been working there....aaaaaaah! just about the time I started to notice I wasn't enjoying the food anymore. 

 I haven't been back since and I notice, a couple of the stores have shut down.  It makes me sad, because this place really had a good thing going.  I am not saying the food is horrible now, but guys, the food used to be sooooo much better. It saddens and frustrates me when quality and consistency takes a back seat to growth.   When they cut corners they cut out what made them great."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I found this place while working at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. There was a location in the food court at the exchange there. Being from AZ, I was craving good fast mexican food and the offerings in MD consisted of Taco Bell. But this place is legit. Great carne asada, which is my go to. And they even had jamaica and horchata. Thanks for saving my palate while I was in DC."}
{"text":"I gotta stop going to this place!!! It's not that good anymore!!!
When it was just the original 2 locations I enjoyed it and never had any complaints.
This location gets my online orders wrong 100% of the time and every time it's  just not that good.  Chips are always stale. Beans taste funky sometimes.  The cheese is different now too. Boo."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be a family favorite, not anymore. Every time we have gone back over the past year it just gets worse and worse! Smaller portions, poor
food quality, and unfriendly, unprofessional staff. After being loyal customers and big fans of the original locations, I doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Why all the hate?  America's Taco is right across the street from my Chevron, they serve up cheap amazing bean and cheese burritos, and they have amazing creamy guacamole.

What could make it better?  Sweet cinnamonny horchata.

It's so cinnamonny that it has two n's."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! The ambience and people are amazing!! Great customer service! If you are looking for getting the best out of your buck this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately I didn't. Went with the husband, child and friend on a Friday night. From the looks of it they do a banging take out business for there was a steady stream of people coming and going. I ordered the ceviche, the husband and his friend both ordered carne asada burritos and a bean an cheese burrito for the son. 

The ceviche wasn't really what I would call ceviche. It was more like chopped shrimp with pico de gallo, cucumbers and chips for dipping. Tasty but not really the ceviche that I am used to and not worth the price. 

The bean and cheese burrito had a really good taste but as soon as my son took his first bite most of the beans ran out and he was left with a soggy tortilla. The beans would most definitely be a hit as a side with dinner or in a cup, but not in a tortilla. 

The carne asada was also good but the burritos were small in size, again not really worth the price. 

The service was friendly and the patio on a nice night is great. Maybe I was expecting some of the best Mexican Food I had ever eaten from reading previous reviews. The food was good but I think for the quantity of food you get it's a little overpriced, I know some are going to disagree and say it's about quality not quantity, and I agree with that to an extent. 

I would go here again if I had a hankering for some Mexican and was in the Melrose area."}
{"text":"Love the layout of the business. Lots of seating out side and also seating inside. Only been here twice. I would go lots more if I did not live in Peoria. They are extremely friendly and helpful when you are ordering. I have had their tacos, burrito and last time the vegetarian Quesadilla. I have found their food very fresh and tasty. I will definitely go back to see them when I am in the area. Go see them I am sure you will enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Would bring entire family here. 

Had to let them go. We come in from Mesa. Long drive Just for the caving of Chips and salsa. Everything else was over priced with very little portions. We noticed one worker extremely over charging for items, Unless she likes you. She was really kind to my Grandfather.

Thank you for the few years of an enjoyable hang out."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that I am glad a business is in this location that is doing fairly well.  This particular location seems to have had a LOT of turnover over the years.

I came here after a recommendation from a friend.  I have to remember that most of my friends and I usually have very different palates, to put it lightly. 

Honestly, I did not find the food to be very good at all.  We had the carne asada tacos, some quesadillas and some chips and guacamole.  We did not really like any of it.  And, we all left with stomach issues.

As a warning... sitting outdoors, your food almost flies away because it seems to be in some sort of wind tunnel.

I won't be coming back here again.  I don't see how people think this place is any good.

I gave the place an extra star because the staff seemed nice enough."}
{"text":"This was yet another stop on what turned into our Fall Break Tour of Phoenix Magazine's Best New Restaurants of 2009.  Unfortunately, I disagreed with Phoenix Magazine again.  It was lunchtime and we had been doing a lot of shopping, so the husband and I had worked up quite the appetite.  We didn't realize that America's was going to be more like appetizer sized food that comes out in entree time.  We waited in line for about 5 minutes or so, I looked at the menu and decided to go basic with a bean and cheese burrito.  It sounded really good at the time.  We ordered and then sat down and waited.  

And waited, and waited, and waited.  Ugh!  But wait, the husband's food came out first.  Almost an entire five minute before mine.  His meal was so small he was pretty much finished by the time I got my burrito.  My burrito was really blah.  I think it's cool that they don't cook the beans with lard, but apparently that translates into a complete and utter lack of flavor.  Same goes for the cheese.  I had no idea any was even in there.  So, I left hungry and unhappy with a nasty bean film in my mouth.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood and I heard good things so I decided to give it a shot. The place is not recommended dine in as it gives me the feeling of an indoor version of one of them mobile food wagons with some fold out benches setup. We ordered some carne asada tacos and some guacamole and chips and a few bottled cokes I believe. 


 The carne asada tacos portion of meat inside was small and the portions of guacamole,cabbage, and onions outweighed the 10 miniscule pieces of meat inside. The taco had almost a hint of peanut butter taste to the guacamole inside the tacos and dip which is disgusting. I am not sure if it was the crazy amount of cabbage that caused the taste but pretty gross. I am completely stunned how anyone can actually like the tacos or guacamole here as even chains like Rubio's have better street tacos(they aren't too shabby actually).

Service: 5/5 they were nice and prompt
Ambiance: definitely take out unless you like picnics
parking: pretty terrible if I recall
food: 0/5 worst tacos I have ever had, guacamole also. I don't mean to be jaded but it was a terrible experience

There isn't many options so I didn't try too much here on the visit with my girlfriend and kid but I won't be going back and still don't know how in the world this could ever be ranked in any food critics reviews."}
{"text":"Best bean and cheese burrito. Ever. And it's vegetarian friendly. Please go try the burrito, I'm on the other side of the country and can't -- you can. Go right now. 

I literally drive straight to America's when I fly into Phoenix for business.

The newer site on 7th ave is less busy. If you're in a hurry, call ahead - they do carry-out fast!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM! Let me say, I was not a fan of America's Taco Shop when I lived in Tempe. Everything about the University location is \"blerg\" for lack of a better word. i am SO glad I gave the phx location a chance.Love the hot sauce/salsa, but would love to see something hotter in addition!"}
{"text":"My chicken quesadilla was not anything special. The guacamole was a weird mixture of diced lettuce and avocado (more lettuce). I'm actually not sure if there was avocado in it. I'm just assuming because they  called it guacamole.  I'm 99% sure their tortillas and salsa were from Costco. Don't get me wrong, I like Costco tortillas and salsa, but not from a resturant that should be making their own."}
{"text":"Out of the, like, hundreds of taco shops in this area, I'm glad we tried this one....super good! This place is almost like the In-N-Out of taco shops; they only serve carne asada and al pastor (pork). They have tostadas, burritos, tacos all based around those two meats. 

You can get vegetarian options too, the beans are not made with lard, and they are super tastey! The tortillas are awesome too!"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how delicious their food here is! Coming from a hispanic/Mexican background I definitely taking eating Mexican food at restaurants serious. Because why pay for it if I can just make it, right??....Let me tell you this is the place to get it all!!! Great ceviche! Their carne asada bowls are delicious! They have about 5 different styles of bean burritos! That is saying a lot!!! This place has a great patio seating area outside which allows you to enjoy your meals outside. Their pricing on all the food is super decent! Not to mention they also have fresh juices available daily!! This place is a MUST TRY & should be on everyones list!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot one fine Saturday after many recommendations and the positive reviews here on yelp, which left me with some pretty high expectations.

Now, I need to preface this by saying I am a Mexican and have eaten alot of carne asada tacos in my lifetime.  I love them.  And I'm open to trying them \"as they come\" from different establishments. 

When ordering tacos, the price is usually an indicator of the size no?  Like an average lunch should be no more than $10? Especially when we're talking carne asada tacos.  I don't think that's too much to expect especially from a place calling itself a \"taco shop\".  So when i saw the tacos were just shy of $3 each I figured two would suffice.  Nope.  I'm guessing maybe four of those suckers might have filled me up.  More than I'm willing to pay for simple carne asada tacos.  But its good to support small local business right? Right.

The tacos here were good. Tasty.  And I understand their \"shtick\" and all.  Good service, nothing out of this world but by no means bad.  They had a couple kids working up front.  The horchata was tasty.  Food came out promptly.  I'm sure they used quality ingredients and at no point did I feel the possibility of contracting some food-borne illness from my food (which would have made the experience more authentic in my opinion, heh)

I just didn't think it was \"all that\" and the size/taste, to me, did not justify the price.

This place is like \"street tacos\" for suits, families,  or people who are scared of going into Mexican dives. 

On a sidenote: the photo treatment they use over and over again on \"America's\" photo is ill-suited and miss leading.  I thought that was the \"vampiro\" I saw mentioned.  Guys if you need a menu re-design hit me up.  :)

I will probably be back at some point since this is in my neighborhood and the food was tasty after all.  I'll either order more tacos or something else."}
{"text":"l love this place, although this location may not be as good as the original one downtown it still hits the spot. The carne asada is delicious and I love their quesadillas. Their chips leave much to be desired but everything else is on point in my opinion. Their corn- off the cob- is amazing!"}
{"text":"America's is one of my favorite taco shops and I frequent this place for lunch and dinner. Their carne asada and al pastor tacos are a must. They season everything perfectly and cut their meat in very small pieces which I like. I also enjoy their carne asada quesadillas because the cheese they use is a really delicious white cheese. I always order the street corn and ask for it off the cob which is never a problem. So good! I take all my visitors here!!!"}
