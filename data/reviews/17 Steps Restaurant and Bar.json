{"text":"Great neo-greek-fusion food - very tasty, very unpretentious, reasonable prices! Kid friendly as well. A good addition to BWV!"}
{"text":"Really good food and service. Truffle frites are ridiculous, as well as the duck confit. My favourite in Bloor West Village"}
{"text":"Recently there for a retirement party which took over the whole restaurant. Approximately 60 people (lets call them potential new customers) NOT!!!  While we had a fixed menu that had been planned weeks before the event, we were served something very different.  What was supposed to be Moroccan Chicken was more like boiled bits of white meat chicken served with white couscous on a plate that was 1/4 full.  10 minutes later a small platter of white potatoes came out and 10 minutes after that our table of 10 got one small platter of under cooked brussel sprouts.  Picture a beige meal with no garnish.  We were suppose to have salad - it never showed up, our food was cold and completely unappetizing.  a glass of wine was to be included in the meal (and was paid for - this meal cost $45) - we were never served or asked if we wanted wine.....  The best however was that when the owner was told that the guests were unhappy after the event, he denied it and refused to acknowledge that the meal was a bust and that he did not provide what had been paid for.  His excuse was that the chef had made a slight mistake on the chicken!  It may be a restaurant in my neighbourhood that I have been to a few times (and never been very impressed) but I can assure you I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Toronto from Michigan and the girl I'm renting an apartment from recommended we try this spot because it was close and easy to find. When we got to 17 steps we were warmly greeted my the bar tender how seated us and quickly gave us the complementary wine and olives. When our server came to our table she explained the menu and and was extremely friendly.        We ordered the Crostini Del Giorno as our appetizer (lamb tar tar topped with quail egg) and it was stunning. For our entrees my friend got the beef tenderloin with salsa Verde and I got the roasted duck breast and pasta. Both dishes were seasoned perfectly, and the presentation was flawless. We also got the pan roasted mushroom and they were probably the best mushrooms I've had in a long time. For desert, we shared the creme brûlée and the flour less brownies. The creme brûlée was fantastic with its nutty flavor, and the brownies we to die for.       What really impressed my about this place besides the food was the level of service we received. The bar tender was and our server were almost like friends. They really cared about our experience, and want the extra mile to make us feel at home. i may be wrong but I think they own the place. all in all i would recommend this  to ANYONE, I'll definitely be back when I come back to the city!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stupid good food. Excellent staff. Trying to digest as fast as possible so I can go later tonight. The braised beef ribs were as good, if not better than mine."}
{"text":"Friendly staff , beautiful restaurant , good food , a bit pricy but that's common with tapas. I recommend it! Tips: Hard to find for new guests - right next to the Pizza Pizza - looks like nothing on the outside but once you get in it definitely has a wow factor!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by this great place hidden downstairs from Bloor. Excellent food, great staff, cool atmosphere, and well priced. I was there yesterday for lunch and came back tonight for dinner."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere here,  and the owners were very friendly and came to greet each table. This made it truly personable and inviting, and what makes it a welcome neighbouhood restarant.  And for this I would come again.   The food was prepared and cooked near perfection. We ordered an antipasti platter. The owner let us know that they cure their own duck there,  and the cheese they purchase daily. It was very good.  For entree,  we ordered the steak and duck confit. As mentioned before,  both were prepared well and cooked well.  So why the 3 stars? My partner and I both thought the quality of the meats were not very good."}
{"text":"This place is not too bad.. but its not too good either. Went here for lunch and got there at around 12pm on a Wednesday. Place was empty. The guy was friendly and nice... i told him it was for a friends birthday and he said there were no specials but could probably throw in a dessert.   While looking at the menus, he gave us free \"shots\" of proseco! which was pretty nice. When ordering, we were told that none of the meals came with any sides. So the prices you were paying (average about $9) did not include any sides..which are an additional $4-$5.   I ordered the lamb burger and split the grilled steelhead trout with a friend and thought the burger was really good (topped with tsaziki sauce) while the fish was just okay. It was a thin filet and was served with blistered cherry tomatoes which were ice cold and leaks that were also cold to room temperature (not sure if it's supposed be like this but i prefer my cherry tomatoes hot; especiially when they've been pan fried and blistered)   the burger and the fish itself were warm/hot.   Don't think i'd ever come back here to be honest. not that the food wasn't good; just not worth coming back! Server was friendly though!  The actual place is actually located in the basement and the decor of this place is really nice. Surprisingly big too! It's got lots of seating and little accents that represent Greece."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here twice now and I have to say I really enjoy the place.  The ambience is great, the service is super friendly and the food is pretty good overall.  I've had the Tangine Chicken and the Rabbit Ragu Pappardelle, both of which were tasty, though I enjoyed the Rabbit more.  I love the wooden beams and basement-y feel of the place, it's cozy and a place I'd like to take friends just to hang out. Haven't tried the Tapas yet but looks good when others do.  The wine list is so-so, wish they allowed you to bring your own, but they do not have  a license for that.  Overall I think I'll be going back, it's not the most mind-blowing place ever but it's nice, quiet, friendly and so far... consistent."}
{"text":"Please note my price estimate didn't include booze--I'd knock it up to the next rung if you're going to have wine.  I was immediately impressed with the atmosphere. It's a basement done up well enough you never realize you're in a basement. There are TVs but we chose to eat away from them. Still, that would be my one major complaint--this restaurant doesn't know if it wants to be fine or casual dining. The wait staff were all very casually dressed and were somewhat boisterous; I thought it undermined the general atmosphere. The owner stopped by to say hello which was a bit awkward, not being someone who partakes in small talk, but it was a gesture of thoughtfulness so *shrugs*  Left to our own devices, however, it was lovely. We were presented with a small cup of sparkling wine and kalamatas before we started. My husband, who doesn't like much, wouldn't stop talking about his beef. The duck in my salad was nice though the cheese was a bit over-kill. Their \"house dips\" are a little strange. The tzaziki was a bit watery and the black bean dip just didn't appeal to my palate. Minor quibbles. The presentation was nice, all the food was well-prepared, the sides were plentiful (served apart from the main dish so I stole plenty from my husband). Overall, we were pleased with the experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The interior is classy casual, each table has a blue runner and a candle and the seats are nice and soft. The decor is mainly wood, think one of the prohibition pubs that exist in Montreal and the lighting fits the decor and brings out the best of it.   Within moments of being seated, my friend and I were presented with a complimentary small glass of sparkling wine and some olives to accompany them. I will admit I'm not generally a fan of sparkling wine but I couldn't resist going back again and again for another sip.  The wine menu isn't huge but it's not your run of the mill wine menu. It's quite obvious these wines are hand-picked and have been tried by all the wait staff. Each is described in three lines indicating flavors, scents and fullness. I ordered a glass of white and was very pleased with the choice.   They have a tapas menu which has a fairly good variety. We shared the empaladas and enjoyed every bite, we both appreciated the nice flaky crust around the filling. Our mains, were wonderful as well. I actually found mine too big and ended up taking some of it home but my friend finished her completely. Sides are ordered and charged separately but I found the main itself would have probably been enough.  Initially, we had been greeted by the owner and he approached our table again at the end of our visit and spent a good few minutes talking with us. He has a sense of humor that not everyone would appreciate (he's the first to admit that) but my friend and I certainly had a few good laughs with him.   They have a few special nights: Wednesday - date night (free dessert for couples), Thursday - ladies night, friday - wine and cheese night (where they will showcase a new wine each week)..  There is no question that my friend and I will return, it's only a matter of when our schedules will match up again. However, I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants a nice evening out or wants to enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"This place was a great random find on a cold winter's night. It is a lovely, and surprisingly big place in the basement in BWV.   We were served by a fantastic veteran of the Toronto new-food scene who started us off with complementary wine (a small, delicious taste) and some olives. After a reasonable wait we had a great set of three dips and grilled pita brushed with olive oil and spices. Not a huge dish, but enough to share.   The mains are what really stood out. After ordering full glasses of the delicious sparkling wine we were presented with two amazing dishes. The Moroccan chicken was great and the Israeli cous cous a nice accompaniment. My girlfriend had a grilled panini with Brussels sprouts (fried with bacon) as the side. Both were amazing, and worth more than the price we paid.    Sadly, didn't have a dessert but I assume they are equally great.   Overall, we'd absolutely visit again. Some of the notes above are true, not a place for a quick dinner, but the food was great and service top notch. The table next to us had an issue with their food, and after alerting their server had it solved within minutes.   We'll be back...next time for what looks like an amazing brunch!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend of a friend.  I'd like to give it a better review if only for the clever use of a basement space, which has been transformed in a pleasant combination of Greek taverna and ratskeller.  Unfortunately I am not able to do so.  Our party of five was seated by a pleasant but rather nervous server.  As soon as we started looking at the wine list, the owner came over and began a sales pitch for one of the more expensive bottles of wine on the menu, something which I never care to hear.  We ordered beer to spite him.  The food from the pan-Mediterranean menu was not bad but did not really rise above mediocre.  Stuffed grape leaves were tasty enough but ordinary and suffered from not being rolled properly.   Another tapa/mezze of french fries in truffle oil had very good fries but not enough truffle flavour.  Two of our party ordered the pasta special, which was not a particularly large portion - possibly due to the owner's loud pronouncement to the servers that it was eighty six shortly after they ordered it.  My order of bouillabaise was tasty but one of the mussels was clearly dead when it was added (broken shell) and it could have used more saffron and fish pieces.  A hike in price of $2.50 or so would certainly have been justified for them to get it right.  Desserts did not rise above ordinary.  We were interested in spending time with the friend in our party so did not mind a leisurely dinner but I would not dine here for a quick meal.  The big screen playing \"Casablanca\" silently in an endless loop was a rather outre touch."}
{"text":"I have been to 17 Steps twice before and both times the food and service was excellent.   The first time that I went I had the gnocchi. It was honestly some of the most delicious gnocchi I have ever had (and I'm Italian, so that's saying a lot!). It was made larger than traditional gnocchi, but it was very light and flavourful. The chef pairs it with a very simple tomato sauce to let the gnocchi shine through as the star of the dish. Absolutely fantastic!  On my second visit I ordered the Coq au Vin (chicken braised in wine). It was simply delicious. The chicken just fell off the bone and the sauce was rich and velvety. Not to gush, but it was an astounding dish!  Aside from the fantastic food, the service is top notch here. As soon as we sat down we were served complimentary olives and sparkling wine to enjoy while we waited for our food.  If you're in the Bloor West Village, you should definitely check this place out! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came across 17 Steps on a Friday night when our first choice, Bryden's, was completely full.  We were seated next to a very large, loud and rowdy birthday party.  It was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation without repeating ourselves and shouting across the table.  We were hungry so we ordered, ate as fast as we could and got the hell out.    Food was alright...tasty tapas (beef ribs and truffle frites).  We had the trout and a sandwich.  Both were good.  Service was prompt, although we observed the manager visiting every table in our area to converse with other diners and completely avoiding us.  We won't be back again."}
