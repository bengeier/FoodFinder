{"text":"I came to Ultimate Café by accident. In a desperate attempt to finally darken the doorway of Hey Lucy, I was disheartened to find that going right after work is not nearly early enough to snag a table for cheap martini Wednesday at that popular King West spot. Enter stage-right, Ultimate Café (a bit of Entertainment District fun for you there). Whether coincidentally or strategically, they also offer their own cheap martini Wednesday - how clever.   Their menu is fairly standard, including soups, nachos, sandwiches and Paninis, pastas and salads and they say the ingredients are bought fresh daily from Kensington Market.  After my first meal, I decided to do some reading and collect the thoughts from others before making my final decision on Ultimate. The reviews are mixed, and I have to agree with that sentiment.  I've now been to Ultimate twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. The night of the martinis, I decided to make a meal of appetizers - a favourite thing to do. I had the spring rolls and the sweet potato and lemongrass soup. I wasn't disappointed in the least; the spring rolls were crunchy and hot and the soup, though a tad too sweet for my own taste (always a risk for sweet potato dishes), was flavourful, thick and rich. It was a satisfying meal but, much like the menu, was basic stuff.  Then, I went back for lunch.   We started with the nachos which turned out to be a delight. They look completely unimpressive, but once you dive in you'll realize that there is just the right amount of melted cheese, neither scorched or soggy, and it's topped lightly with chopped lettuce, tomato, olives and jalapeno. I have come across some online grumbles about the portion sizes, but any more and it would have proven far too big for a two-person starter or a one-person meal. My entrée was the Montreal smoked meat Panini with a side salad. The Panini was my favourite dish there by far. The meat was warm and tender and, again, was not over-sized. The sandwich was obviously freshly pressed and there was a tangy mustard spread topping it off. But, here's the rub - the salad was small and the leaves were wilted, which is a common complaint across the boards about their greens and the dressing could not possibly have been made in-house. It maybe could have passed for garnish. A really top-notch side could have elevated this dish to be lunch-time excellence. Like the portions, the prices are decent, with both of my visits coming in at just around $20 per person  There is one very short footnote-type comment that I must leave you with. On both occasions I was greeted by an employee whom I can only assume is the host. He will nab you on the street when you stop to glance at the menu to convince you to come in and, though he means well, will be extremely present during your time there. I can't say it was bothersome enough to warrant a phone call, but I also cannot give you my recommendation without mentioning this very obvious addition to the dining experience at Ultimate.   So, I toyed with a 2-star vs. my decided upon 3-star rating. The decor is kind of cool, the service was fast and courteous, despite the over-attentive host and we were seated in no time on a busy night. They offer some pretty good, if not somewhat lack-lustre grub, with at least one amazing sandwich.   Just doors down from the previously reviewed Joe Mamas, King West is turning out to be a favourite food stop for me."}
{"text":"Me my husband visited this place for a few times an they have a simple menu in which are really tasty.I like their paninis and soups. A place to hang out around king st.w area."}
{"text":"I would recommend saving your money. I've never written a review on Yelp before, because I prefer to read others reviews and make decisions based on them. However this meal was so bad, I had to spread the word.   The lamb was all fat (and even though they'll tell you \"that's how lamb is\" I've had lamb enough times to know that it should be butchered to the bone and have a nice medallion of meat on the end), the mash was 100% from a box and my girlfriends pad Thai might as well have been made of actual rubber.   In the decade I've lived in Toronto, this was the worst meal I've ever had and I eat out every night. If it wasn't for $4 martinis the night would have been a complete bust.   Do yourself a favor and hit up one of the other 20 restaurants on this strip."}
{"text":"Visited Ultimate Cafe for Friday lunch as I work in the City. I was in a party of 7.  I ordered the Stead and Eggs. The food was reasonably good. They served my steak medium - as I ordered it. Buttered toast was crispy and not dry. Potatoes were seasoned properly.  Presentation was okay, if a bit understated. Portion size was just right. The only thing that bothered me about the order was that they put what I think was steak sauce on the steak. I don't use steak sauce. Having the kitchen put it there makes it seem they're not confident in their steak.  The food took a while to be served. Considering that we were the first group to come in at that time, it still took about 20 minutes for the first plate to be served.  On the other hand, the ambiance of the place was better than average. The lighting and decor gives it a pub atmosphere. I find it comfortable personally.  Overall, Ultimate Cafe is so-so. Food is good, but nothing to write home about. Probably not a good place to go if you're in a hurry. Perhaps it should be called the Easy Going Cafe.  P.S. Although it's an all-day breakfast place, they don't serve pancakes. FYI!"}
{"text":"The food here was awesome, and there was a good martini special going on at the time of my visit. Also little wait when other nearby restaurants seemed to have ridiculous waits. I would definitely return. The service was great and the food tasted delicious!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning and most places on King Street were either closed or not serving breakfast.  The Ultimate Cafe answered the call.  Cozy little cafe with attentive, friendly staff.  Eggs and bacon were done right.  Nothing fancy.  Good size crowd inside as every table was taken when we finished."}
{"text":"I have been living in Toronto for over 2 years and this is HANDS DOWN the worst restaurant experience Ive had here.  Every aspect of my experience was atrocious.   The server was pleasant but it didnt take long for the night to get off to a bad start. I went for dinner with 3 other people and out came 3 starters but one soup was nowhere to be seen. The server came over to the table numerous times and didnt notice the fact that he had no food in front of him. About 30 minutes passed and out came his main course. At which point he enquired about his missing starter. The server came back and apologised and said that the manager agreed to take a startling $3 off the bill to adequately compensate him.  Obviously,we found the $3 gesture a derisory offer but we just werent in the mood to complain and said we would just leave it at that and not make a fuss.   From this point onwards there was a plethora of mistakes,one after another.  The food itself was poor. We ordered a steak, a pasta dish,a pad thai dish and a teriyaki dish. 4 completely different types of cuisine but they had one thing in common: they tasted awful!  The service was very slow and pieces of food came in dribs and drabs, with long wait times in between.  One friend of mine,ordered a cappucino and it came old cold.Another ordered cheesecake which against all odds,actually tasted delicious.   Completely fed up we decided to just get out of there as quick as possible and to cap everything else off the Credit machine wasnt working!! We were told to sit down and wait for 5 minutes while the machine recharged.   At this point we requested to speak to a manager. The server kept making excuses,saying that they were so busy due to TIFF being on and that they usually get great compliments from customers. Firstly,the restaurant was moderately busy but far from hectic. Certainly not enough to justify all the failures on display. And secondly,how does someone else complimenting their dinner help my bad experience? Throughout the night the servers were constantly citing excuses to other customers to explain their shortcomings. It seemed as if complaints meant nothing to them and they were accustomed to excuses.  Ive worked in the service industry in the past and would be mortfied if such complaints were directed towards me. Their ambivalence to the complaints was truly shocking and unacceptable.  The server re-emerged to say that the manager was too busy to come speak to us and that he would only say the same things that she was saying. Again, this is unacceptable. What sort of respectable manager has no interest in speaking with disgruntled customers?  I decided to seek the manager myself. When I asked for the manager I was again told he was \"too busy\" to deal with us. At this point there was an astronomincal 10-15 people in the restaurant,so I understood that he would be unavailable. I enquired as to where the manager was and was told that he actually wasnt there. So we were lied to by multiple employees.  The gentleman I spoke to said that the floor manager wasnt there and he was the bar manager, so by virtue of that fact, he was the manager on duty.  I believe his name was Min and without a shadow of doubt,he is the most unprofessional, inept manager Ive ever encountered.  I explained my frustration and he actually began laughing in my face!! I questioned what was so funny and he just kept saying \"Im so sorry.\" Its hard to see sincerity in someones apology when he is on the cusp of full blown laughter.  With the restaurant under his command its no surprise how much of a shambles it is. He hadnt even got the professional courtesy to even listen to our concerns. I asked him if he felt a $3 discount was an appropriate solution to a completely spoiled evening where the bill was $151. He continued to laugh and frivolously apologise and offered so explanation.   All in all a terrible experience.  Awful food Awful service Inexplicable management  Theres a hotdog stand on the corner of the street which would offer a more enjoyable and engaging dining experience than The \"Ultimate\" Cafe.  The only reason I have given this restaurant 1 star is because Yelp doesnt allow you give 0 stars,which is a far fairer reflection of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a reasonably priced, fast place with decent food. Staff are always pleasant. The place has character! I've yet to have a bad meal there and I have been many times. If your looking for somewhere quick, cheap and good in the entertainment district this is an excellent choice!"}
{"text":"Went there for dinner, the food was OK, nothing special. Comparing with the pricy restaurants on king, it can be a choice if you want to stay on budget..."}
{"text":"Not great, not bad. Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere. The prices were okay and so was the food. A lot of choices on both sides and up and down the block. The penne with Italian sausage was most sausage. Pad Thai was average at best."}
{"text":"I had heard some mixed reviews about Ultimate Cafe. Being in the King and Spadina area this weekend around lunch time, hunger, convenience and the rain drove me to try it.        The inside was nice enough and had some funky decorations (something that always catches my eye); there was the huge exhaust duct hanging from the ceiling-haven't seen that in a restaurant on King St. before!...Ok, what everyone really cares about is the food and service, right?   Well, I ordered the Montreal smoked meat and butternut squash soup and was pleasantly surprised; the food was great! The service, however was sub-par, but I did notice a Hiring Now sign in the window.     Overall, I can't complain; lunch was cheap and my stomach was satisfied. It's nothing special. We've probably all been to a place like this in Toronto; just another restaurant, nothing more."}
{"text":"Wednesday night $4 Martini's...oh boy! Enough said...but I will go on!  Can i just say hmmmm mmm so a couple of girlfriends and I had been out for thai and decided we needed somewhere to have a drink. Walking along King west we decided to check out one of the bars at King and John. $4 Cocktails, shouts the guy standing outside Ultimate Cafe...sold! I always blame the fact that I am Scottish on loving a good booze bargain.  Due to the fact we had eaten somewhere else we just had drinks and they were good. I would recommend the After 8, Tiny Bowl and the classic Cosmo...if you can mix a good Cosmo then I am yours...and Ultimate Cafe I am yours!  I will most definitely be back to try the food!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down the strangest restaurant I've been to. The most bizarre thing for me was the random menu, which at quick glance we thought was Italian. On the same page as the pastas were pad Thai, chicken teriyaki and a few other Asian dishes. We found service to be inconsistent as well. The party next to us was offered Parmesan cheese and pepper on their dishes, while we were not offered any for our pastas. I really don't know how my companion and I ended up here for dinner  (even the host on the street seemed less than enthused), but I will not be back!"}
{"text":"As one walks down King Street between John Street and Peter Street, a bevy of restaurant greeters try to entice you to take a look at their menu. We were feeling Italian-ish and not wanting to spend more than $20 per person. Ultimate Cafe's menu looked ok to my lunch buddy so we walked in.   In all honesty, we should've walked away. Upon seating, our server gave us a view of her cleavage and asked us for our drink orders with nary a smile. No smile. A few minutes later, she slammed our water glasses down on the table. Shannon decided on a Chicken with Rose Sauce pasta and a side Caesar salad. I ordered Italian sausage with Tomato Sauce pasta. No smile. She comes back with a basket of stale bread and packets of rock hard butter. Then our food came. Shannon said her pasta was ok . But her Caesar salad was disgusting with its bottled dressing, wilted lettuce, clumps of powdered parmesan and 2 stale croutons. My pasta was also disgusting. The italian sausage was the same sausage sold at hot dog stands. If I wanted street meat, I would've bought it from the vendor. The tomato sauce was nothing special like it came out of a bottle. It seems ready-made convenience food was popular with Ultimate Cafe. Did they actually make anything or was everything just opened up, heated up and plated?  Cold and apathetic service + BAD food = Never ever going there again."}
{"text":"I went for my second time to the Ultimate Cafe this weekend and I have to say that I had a great brunch there!  First off, the brunch menu is fairly large for this smaller restaurant.   Secondly, the food is yummy and definitely left me and the group I was with very satisfied.  And lastly, the prices were reasonable.  I had an egg-white omelette with spinach and feta cheese, paired with a side of potato hashbrowns and four pieces of whole wheat toast with butter and jam.  My boyfriend had an amazing breakfast sandwich, which was stacked with a huge egg, cheese and veggies I believe.  Overall, the bill for 5 people, including 4 coffees, was $70. This is around $14 per person.  And although the cafe is fairly plain looking inside, it has a nice open-concept interior, which allows fresh air and sunshine to tiptoe in during nice summer days. This is great because you get it either way, patio seats or no patio seats."}
{"text":"Situated across from TIFF Lightbox is this ``ultimate`` cafe. Sadly, it really is not.   There are so many places to choose from but the convenience won out plus I was not really interested in eating at a chain or ethnic cuisine for breakfast.   Lured in by the chalkboard, we walked in.  Made a quick look at the menu and ordered the ultimate breakfast. This consisted of hash browns, sausage, bacon, your choice of toast and  eggs made your way.     Disappointing. My overcooked bacon and burnt hash browns was unappetizing.  The sausage and the scrambled eggs were fine but the experience with the remaining mains was terribly unsettling.  I ate only as much to fill my hunger but after a point I just could not eat anymore.   I was surprised, that the server had not come by and asked `how was my meal?`    Although reasonably priced, the money you spend on mediocre food that one may not finish, I would consider checking out other establishments along the entertainment strip."}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday with my friend as we were trying to find a brunch place to eat at before heading to watch a TIFF movie at Scotiabank at 12:30. A lot of places are closed on Sunday (or not opened until 11), and Cora's was full. We were walking along King Street West and found this little place with a lot of people, so we went straight in.  We both had coffee and the eggs benedict. I had mine with bacon, and my friend with prosciutto. It was okay - not AMAZING, but it DID come with home fries and fruit. The eggs benedict had a little too buch butter for my liking.  Service though, was impeccable. Our waitress had a smiling face the entire time!"}
{"text":"#BREAKFAST #BRUNCH #TORONTO #YELP  Meh! Breakfast for lunch. My boyfriend enjoyed their Ultimate breakfast or something and I grumbled about my $13 grilled cheese. It didn't taste good and wasn't worth the price. There are better places to eat around. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"Definitely a good bet if you are on King st. in the entertainment district.  Most of the restaurants around there are very overpriced for only okay-ish food.    Its generally empty, so you can seated right away, so if you are in the mood for brunch and don't feel like waiting-  this is your place.  The menu is very standard-  nothing out of the ordinary, so don't come here expecting to try something new and daring.  Its just standard, good food at a good price.    The waitresses are always friendy and food always comes out quickly.  They are also quick with the coffee refills which is huge in my book."}
{"text":"I wandered into this restaurant on a Sunday morning in February, looking for someplace other than a Starbucks for breakfast.  This is a cozy space with warm colors.  They do a good English-style breakfast with eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes and bread or toast.  The potatoes were seasoned well, but could have been diced a little smaller.  The meats were cooked perfectly.  The service was very good - prompt, cheerful, and smiling."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here after being unable to find much other kid friendly food on the street. While they don't have a kid menu, they can make kid portions of any dish. Pasta was fresh and flavorful. $5 house wine was an added perk."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here - reasonable food at reasonable prices.  Not bad, just not very remarkable in terms of uniqueness or flavour of food.  Cozy atmosphere, but again nothing really to set it apart from any other cafe."}
{"text":"Decent diner-style brunch menu with reasonable prices ($8.99-12.99). Usual fry ups with eggs, bacon and toast. Omelets, sandwiches, french toast, steak & eggs.  Food was ok. I had smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, homefries and toast ($9.99). Portion size was just right. Food was not too greasy.  Our server was fairly good, topped up coffee a few times and checked in on if we needed anything. Food came out quickly enough.  Not enough healthy menu options on the brunch menu but I suppose that's not unusual.   Tables on the interior were arranged kind of strangely. Small patio area with 3-4 tables."}
{"text":"Despite the semi-kitschy decor, this little King St. cafe is a winner. We came in for breakfast / brunch and were served promptly, with a smile. Food came out of the kitchen quickly & despite semi-lackluster portion size for the meats ordered, everything was excellent.   Definitely a positive addition to the entertainment district. Small in size (seats maybe 25 people max?) but has a very extensive menu. Paid about $13/pp after tip. Would go again!"}
