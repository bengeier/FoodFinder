{"text":"The food was good BUT the service was terrible. There was no spoon for my coffee; they ran out of spoons they said. The waitresses aren't too friendly either. They were busy with their cell; texting and I had to wait a while for my coffee to be refilled. I was pretty much ignored for most of the lunch. Won't go again due to poor services. Also my home fries were burnt/dry. Other than that..the egg Benedict was good."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant pour le petit dej choix variés : ufs pancakes et fruits frais. Service impeccable"}
{"text":"I really liked this place, the ambiance, the food, very nice staff too.
I recommand it!

J'ai bien aimé cette place, les plats sont frais, beaux et bons en même temps. Les gens qui travaillent là-bas sont très gentils et amicales. Ils vous conseillent sur le menu. Merci!"}
{"text":"Yum! Excellent food, tons of fruit included with your meal! Prices are pretty good, the kids meals are under $6 and include beverage (my daughter loved the hot chocolate with whipped cream!). The service was also wonderful! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I always heard great reviews about Cora's in Edmonton. When it opened here, I was quite excited to try it for myself. The interior is very friendly and inviting. The servers are pleasant. However, the food itself was rather disappointing because it didn't live up to the hype I heard prior. I had one of the Crepomelette with Hollandaise sauce. It was pretty bland, and the Hollandaise sauce was chunky. I figured maybe I just had an unfortunate experience and came back a couple more times. Again, service was fine, the mood was less then mediocre. It was edible, but not that great. The fruit was yummy, but that's not hard to screw up. Prices are decent. I just wish the food tasted better all around. 

In a nutshell: I've had much better breakfast elsewhere, such as Phil's in Red Deer, or Diner Deluxe in Calgary. Not sure about the other new Cora locations in Calgary, but this one in Airdrie was just meh for me."}
{"text":"CLOSED DOWN, it is now called Petinos and by far a better breakfast place. Chez Cora started it, but Petinos perfected it.

This place has closed down, replaced by PETINOS, great Greek breakfast joint. Yes Gaston is there.

Always good service and have been frequenting this joint for a while, staff is very friendly and know most of their customers.  It's breakfast done well and price is reasonable. It gets crazy after 10.30 AM on Sundays, thats when the families with kiddies come in."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with the boyfriend. Great service, the waffle I ordered was huge with lots of fruit, but I wasn't impressed.  The price for two was reasonable. If you want breakfast later in the morning, this place isn't that bad."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Montreal, very close from the Sheraton hotel. The food portions are huge but it is so delicious, i'll guarantee there will be no left overs. I had a crepe filled with fruits and nutella cream, by far the best crepe i had...we went back the next day, and food was still delicious but the service seemed extremely slow, i guess they must have been busy. Also, if you don't want to wait to be seated, try arriving between 9 and 10 in the morning, after 10:30, there is a line out the door."}
{"text":"The very best chicken I've acquired. I like toast chicken along with deep-fried chicken along with observed this kind of to become the very best I've ever had. The skin is crisp possesses any feel to be deep-fried and not muck. Best is usually sizzling hot to describe this. Traveled to schwartzs which can be appropriate across the street along with travelled with this location to provide for feeding on any smoked meat meal.."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service and food overall, I really think the management...or the entire Chez Cora's corporate executive team needs to check out what Allo Mon Coco is doing, it's not so difficult to find out why the other major chain is demolishing them. Chez Cora does not serve fresh high quality fruit, and when it looks \"ok\" it's tasteless. You really need to start controlling the quality of the fruit gets into your kitchen. Second: the service. I'm patient towards newer servers that are learning, but at least put someone monitor them to make sure they are doing their job right. We were never served cutlery, no coffee refills, no water, no napkins, no condiments. Everytime we ask for those items we did not get them, we had to walk over the counter. The more experienced waiter came over giving us an attitude. The type of attitude you are willing to ignore when you are in a place that serves excellent food, but sadly, this is not the type."}
{"text":"With all the new breakfast places popping up in the WI, this place is still the most unpretencious, incredibly firendly experienced staff with the best breakfast you can get. They've been around for awhile and they know how to do breakfast right!"}
{"text":"When you look at the pictures in the menu, you think - naah, can't be that good in real life. But it WAS! 

We had the bagel with smoked salmon and a heaping pile of fruit which was absolutely amazing, and the other dish was a cinnamon brioche made french toast style with an egg and bacon and heaping pile of fruit. I ordered a side of custard for dipping :)

I can't remember a better breakfast anywhere, seriously. And also, very good service!

We went on a Saturday morning, there was a long line out the door - so be prepared.  There's a Starbucks a couple of blocks away on Rue St Catherine - maybe stop there first and then you won't mind the line as much."}
{"text":"Very pleasant dining experience. We sat outside on a Sunday morning, and enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. Was a little busy when we were there so good took a while. Cutlery was also dirty so we asked for plastic. Cora's is always a breakfast favourite in my books though. There was the odd fruit fly flitting around ...."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast with my mom and daughter. The restaurant is very tired looking and the bathrooms dirty so when you see that it changes your mood for breakfast. The server was fine the breakfast ok. Would no go back for the reason lots of older eating establishments still look and seem clean."}
{"text":"I been at Chez Cora few times, and every time with my girlfriend. My girl love that place, food, staff, service. That was said, if she likes it, you will like it! Honestly, it is a great little place. All good!"}
{"text":"feels like I got ROBBED! Not a good deal. $13 for a mediocre breakfast (they just put a bit of fruit on a crepe). Big deal. 
Avoid like the plague. Try other breakfast alternatives in the city! There are plenty."}
{"text":"Great food !!! Love their crepes. :) Good atmosphere and Lovely staff! Definitely my new favourite breakfast diner."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?
Cora was known to serve fresh and succulent breakfasts - making it well worth the cost (and more). In 2016, it's far from it! The coffee is awful (and don't give me the \"free refill\" excuse). The pancakes/breads taste like they've been sitting in the kitchen for days on end...my toast was stale and OVER-buttered. I guess they really had to get rid of their butter(?). The eggs were fried not in a delicious way, but in that these aren't fresh & the taste needs to be hidden.

Terrible service. Old fruit. Terrible batter. Bad bacon....not going back!"}
{"text":"Un brunch chez Cora, c'est un incontournable si vous passez à Montréal ...."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here although it wasn't out of this world.  I hovered between 3 and 4 stars.  I don't agree with other reviewers who compared it to Denny's though... clearly those people have not eaten at Denny's recently.  I also had no problem with the potatoes, they seemed just fine.  I had the eggs ben et dictine and they were pretty good (definitely not the best I've ever had but solid).  The hollendais sauce could have been better (it was very tame).  We also ordered the rasberry crepes which were good although we were a little surprised that they were served cold ( not necessarily a bad thing just surprised us).  I loved the fruit garnish on the plates!

The service was fine although as some noted not the quickest.  They didn't seem to have many waitstaff for the crowd, but it wasn't a problem for us."}
{"text":"I've been to lots of Cora restaurants, and this was by far the worst. I ordered the asparagus Swiss Benedict. It had so much sauce on it I had to ask for a spoon and dish to scoop it off. After removing half a cup of sauce, it was still barely edible. The potatoes were dripping with oil. 
My server never once came to ask how the meal was or refill my coffee- I had to ask one of the other servers."}
{"text":"The whole time I was here I couldn't shake the feeling that I was in a Denny's by a different name.

Food was decent, but nothing special. I had a little skillet of potatoes, eggs, veggies, and cheese. Not bad, but rather bland and unexciting. 

Service was slow and inattentive. It took ages to get coffee, coffee refills, and the check. You pay for your meal at the register, rather than with your server. There was a line at least 10 people deep waiting to pay when we went up to pay. Nothing like waiting in line for 15 minutes to pay for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"It was fun, I paid 16$ for a crepe omelet and a latte,
I was happy. It's not very speacial but if you like crepes and omelets try it for sure"}
{"text":"Below average food. The service can be spotty, depending on the time of day.

Just..look elsehwere. I'm surprised they are still in business."}
{"text":"Walked out after not getting our food while our waitress took her break a few tables over and watched us wait. Waited a half an hour. Oh, by the way, the place was empty with three waitresses and two cooks. WON'T go back."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, meh service. My friends and I came here twice in the last 3 days as our hotel is just nearby. Seating was quick, we got water quickly as well, however, we ordered drinks before food and didn't receive them until after our food was on the table. Despite this, they were out of chocolate milk and they neglected to bring cream to the table, we had to get it from an empty table by ourselves. Water was not refilled until just before leaving, neither was our coffee after we got it. Food was good, some the eggs around the outside were a little cold but tasted good. The owner should really consider hiring more staff during morning and brunch."}
{"text":"I really like breakfast places ... eggs late in the day are always a treat!  While Chez Cora is a chain, I do like their menu and I've never had a bad meal at any location (and I've been to a lot of them).

I'm giving this location 5 stars because of how well they treat my parents every time they go there.  Whenever I meet my parents for a bite to eat at this location, the staff always remembers them, saying hello & catching up on conversations from a previous visit, and doing the little things that make a big difference.    Well done!"}
{"text":"There's better breakfast food choices in the area...much better ones.

Chez Cora was recommended to me by a friend, who claimed it was cheap and it was delicious.  Me and a friend went here on Friday morning.  There was a line that reached out their door, but the line went quickly.  I took this as a good sign...but I shouldn't have.  Chez Cora is huge, with many many tables inside and stressed staff trying to keep up.  The waiters zoom past you nearly at a jog, and it's extremely difficult to get someone's attention.

I ordered 3 eggs over easy, 3 strips of bacon, 2 sausages, a mound of apple-cut potatoes, and some fresh fruit of pineapple, cantaloupe, and strawberry.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon was alright...not soggy, so that's good. But strangely tasteless?  I'm not sure how that happens.  The sausages were the worst - extremely tasteless, I couldn't tell if it was a chicken or a pork sausage, or a combination.  It just tasted like bland fat.  The potates were also rather tasteless; I think they were simply boiled, sliced, and that's it.  I see that some people are raving about having fresh fruit....but in Montreal, this is not uncommon at all.  You'd expect it as much as you'd expect a hotel to have a toilet or a bed.  There's nothing special about it.

Oh, also the waiter forgot to give us our coffee, which is supposed to be part of the breakfast set we ordered.  It was hard to flag down our waiter - or any waiter - because he was constantly rushing around to deal with other people.  This isn't his fault per se...they just don't have enough staff to cover such a big area.  Even though there were many empty tables in our section...the waiter could traverse one entire row and not see my hand up at all, because there's so much space.  We already had the single-serve packets of cream from when they first delivered our breakfast food, but they never gave us a cup of coffee to dump it in to.

Finally, we flagged the waiter down.  \"Isn't this breakfast supposed to come with coffee?\"  

Waiter replied, \"Yes.\"

Long, silent pause transpired between us.

\"Can we have our coffee?\"

Waiter replied, \"Yes.\" Then disappeared.

He returned with coffee that, sadly, was not worth the effort to get.  It was weak, but at the same time I didn't want it to be any stronger because it also tasted awfully burnt.

The price is not drastically cheaper, so I would not go here again.  There's far better breakfast places a stone throw away; their lower price does not justify the bland tastes and bad service.  Why make yourself suffer over $2?"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was fast. I didn't have to wait in line to get seated. I find that everywhere you go these days when it comes to brunch you have to wait to be seated for at least 20 minutes. I went to this place because at Allo mon coco they told us there's a 15 minute wait. After waiting for 15 minutes,  I asked again how long the wait would be and they said another 5-10 minutes. I felt like I was in the episode of Seinfeld where they were told many times that it would be 5-10 minutes (Chinese restaurant).
The food here was great and the service was fast. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Petit dejeuner type 'dinners', pas mal d'options avec pancackes, gauffres et beaucoup de fruits frais. Les portions sont assez copieuses. On sent les serveurs assez debordés le matin, souvent de l'attente pour payer ou obtenir une table. L'expresso facturé en sus alors que le cafe regulier est dispo a volonté c'est bizzare.."}
{"text":"This is my favourite breakfast restaurant. I usually get the Cora Special and share it with a friend cause the portions are usually pretty big, for me atleast. I always leave feeling full enough.
I wouldve given it 3 and a half just cause the prices are a bit high for breakfast.."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a cora's and it lives up to everyone bit of the hype. The service was ok(my drink was empty for half of my meal) but the food was out of this world. I had the 90's harvest which came with an egg, bacon and enough fruit to make you feel better about even the unhealthiest of diets all on top of some sort of delicious cinnamon raisin bread. The abundance of fruit in the meal made me feel full without feeling bloated after I cleared my plate unlike a traditional breakfast diner type meals."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, menu, and food. More fruit than you can eat comes with everything."}
{"text":"Frankly I had low expectations after reading online reviews from Yelp and elsewhere, but decided to meet for Sunday brunch at Chez Cora anyway because of its convenient location and the lack of other options in the area.
Overall I was pleasantly surprised. The ridiculous line out the door moved faster than expected, our server was friendly and brought drinks and food quickly, and no one made us feel bad about sitting for a long time despite their obvious need for tables.
The food was pretty good, too. My over-easy egg was perfectly cooked, the cinnamon brioche French bread was quite tasty, if a bit dry, and my plate arrived with a generous quantity of their trademark fresh fruit (although not all of it was ripe). 
Chez Cora's breakfast offerings are hardly transcendent, but if you're looking for a decent breakfast in this area, it's not a bad choice."}
{"text":"Great spot in the village. Friendly staff, even though they forgot our cutlery. The portions are huge. And the view of St Catherine St is awesome."}
{"text":"Resto pour prendre des petit-déjeuners copieux: pancakes, waffles, crêpes, oeufs-bacon, fruits frais etc. L'endroit est situé juste en bas d'un hôtel. La clientèle y est très familiale."}
{"text":"Bad Service,Good Food,No Gluten Free Menu."}
{"text":"Good Cora location - with the exception of the surrounding industrial area - a diamond in the rough if you will. Not a busy location, but this is welcome, with easy accessible parking and no waiting in line! - bonus!

If you've been to a Cora's before, you'll come to expect the delicious dishes they usually serve up for brunch. Love the eggs benedict, Cora special, quebec special with the cretons, and pretty much everything else on the menu. The fresh fruit allays any guilt - it's all healthy tasty stuff ;)

Happy staf, and fast no-nonsense friendly service. I'm glad this is so close to home! Keep it up lovely people."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. If you are looking for healthy, they have tons of fresh fruit in many ways. They also do standard breakfast very well. We like the crepes."}
{"text":"J'dore Chez Cora! It's the best place in America's hat for some petit dejeuner: wonderful pancakes, homefries, and great orange juice. 
Plus their logo is this cute little smiley sun. I accidentally imported one of their coffee mugs to America because the little sun way saying \"take me to America! American movies come out quicker there!\"
Always a line, or should I say queue, on weekend mornings due to those Canadian wake and bakers but they have the right idea."}
{"text":"Ich wurde während eines Business-Trips eingeladen und wäre sonst nie aufmerksam auf diesen Laden geworden. Das wäre eine Schande gewesen! Denn hier gibt's wirklich außerordentlich leckeres Frühstück und RIESENPORTIONEN. Egal ob Pancakes, Waffeln, French Toast, Eierspeisen oder Würstchen - hier gibt es fast alles. Dabei bekommt man bei den meisten Mahlzeiten noch frisches Obst dazu. Der Preis ist etwas gesalzen, aber bei der Menge und dem Geschmack zahl ich den gern. War ein außerordentliches Erlebnis."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is bang for buck breakfast. Tastes great and a plethora of different variations on your good ol' breakfast mainstays. The presentation is really taken to heart at this place... Read as: they use many fallic fruit/food items... Gengis, our waiter was an aiight guy.. My Gurl called him Jean-Guy... Hahahaha"}
{"text":"I loved this place. My boyfriend and I went here for late breakfast before the Pride Parade, and we arrived just in time to miss a big rush.

I got one of their savoury crepes and my boyfriend got blueberry pancakes. A generous portion of various fresh fruits came with my meal. The crepes were yummy, and I liked the sausages that filled them. My boyfriend devoured his entire meal and remarked how good the place was. 

My boyfriend also go a yogurt-based strawberry milkshake, which he finished within a few minutes of its arrival. I had a little taste of it, and it was divine. 

Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and that's fine. I would have liked it if she checked with us more often, but the place was getting busy, so I would give her a pass on this one. The interior decor was okay -- eccentric, but also obviously from a chain restaurant. 

I'd go back here just for the fresh food alone...."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on the way from Montreal to Toronto. Lots of options, everything was fresh and tasty. The place is big with a nice view to the lake and seating outside and inside. Family and Kids friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, beautifully plated and served by friendly staff. We enjoyed it so much, we ended up going three times over the course of our week in Montreal.

The crepes and French toast were hot and delicious. The bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly. The huge portions of fresh fruit really rounded out the meal. 

The wait staff was friendly and quick to top off my coffee, a feature I really appreciate. 

If you're looking for a great breakfast, it's tough to go wrong here."}
{"text":"Cora is a fairly big chain in Canada so you know what you will get: it is good, very good. Large selection of 'designer' breakfast made with fruits, eggs, bacon, sausages, crepes, etc. Good for families because of the cool kid-friendly menu and friendly staff. All fresh and real stuff. Of course you will pay the price: don't expect to get a breakfast there for 8$ a person. If you are just visiting Montreal, this is the perfect place for breakfast. My favorites are 'Déjeuner Magie' and Crêpes choco-bananes."}
{"text":"L'un des meilleurs Cora!!la bouff miamm le service.. Tjr un plaisir! Simple j'adore! Le menu monstre.. Demander rien n'est impossible ici! Et les cocktails  un svp, pis un autres encore!! Fait avec de vraie fruits!"}
{"text":"Bon, je suis vendue aux restaurants de déjeuner, et Cora est un incontournable! On s'y sent toujours bien et le personnel est généralement bien sympathique et courtois. La nourriture est toujours bonne et les assiettes généreuses! J'ai un faible pour la crêpe Lucie la Framboise et les oeufs bénédictines!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Loads of fresh fruit, crepes, eggs! Very clean restaurant I loved it"}
{"text":"C'est tellement pas les meilleurs déjeûners... Chaque fois je me demande pourquoi je vais la-bas. Souvent c'est par manque de connaissance du quartier ou par faute de mieux. C'est plate a dire, mais c'est ça.

Les crèpes sont caoutchouteuses, on doit payer pour avoir du vrai sirop, le service est vraiment ordinaire, c'est toujours plein, etc. Je préfère vraiment les endroits uniques ou on sert de la bouffe vraiment maison.

En plus je ne peux pas supporter les décorations de coq, je trouve ça laid hahaha, Cocorico!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning for breakfast.  There was a little bit of a wait, but were seated pretty quickly.

Service was good.  When we got our food, all 4 of our eggs were cold.  Looks like they waited too long to serve it to us.  I was pretty disappointed and didn't eat the cold eggs.

On the flip side, their fruit is always fresh and tasty. They also had decent coffee.

I would give them another shot next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Meh. That about sums up my feelings about Cora. It's interior is bright, the servers are cheery, but the food is a letdown. Bacon was charred and the crepes were poorly done. The two eggs weren't bad, over easy. The coffee was decent too. However, for breakfast, there are better options."}
{"text":"If you are coming before 10 its nice and quiet, after 10 its madness.   
when the place is busy the service become slow.
VERY SLOW!!! waited for a coffee more then 15min!!!!  
but in general the place is OK, the food is good as usual in Cora."}
{"text":"The best breakfast place you can ever imagine yourself is this one. Any varieties of favourite breakfast options are offered in here: eggs, omelettes, pancakes, crepes, fruits, bacon, sausages, oatmeal, fruit jams and never ending coffees The presentation of every other dish is beautifully accomplished, which makes it even more appetizing. I prefer the traditional English breakfast options they have, but if you want to eat something more modern, there are a few updates to try such as a \"breakfast burger\".
The staff is very professional, friendly and willing to help any time you need. 
Menu is available in both English and French."}
{"text":"I think I'm a bit biased with this location, first I like it because it is very close to our place. In general I like most Chez Cora's because they are kids friendly and spacious, so we can enjoy a nice family breakfast. 
This branch has a nice service and atmosphere. We have never had an issue with service or food every time we went there. I usually do not like franchises but this one I give them all the respect for the food and service. 

Keep it up

Note: if you are going to Ottawa, Quebec City or passing by the TransCanada (AUT-40) and you need a break then this is the place to go to. It's right off the highway and has a lot of free parking outside. You won't have to change your direction."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, there was a man who looooooved eating breakfast in restaurants. And so his wife took him to Chez Cora for a treat. 

The man was in carb heaven after eating both crèpes AND french toast (what is this word, \"or\"?) with a mountain of fresh fruit. He was glad his wife encouraged him to go for the real maple syrup, even at 50 cents extra per little plastic cup.

His wife was less impressed with her eggs benedict, which were overly salty and served cold on a soggy English muffin. (What is it with Cora's? Every time I have been to any of their locations, the food always comes out cold. They should heat their plates or something.) But her fruit was yummy, and she appreciated the fast service.

Overall verdict...not bad for a chain (at least it's a local chain). But not fantastic either. Maybe I should have had the crèpes."}
{"text":"I'm rating this location over all a 3 for service but the food and the presentation was excellent. I had the fruit cup with a bagel, a cup of tea (water was Luke warm), a glass of orange juice. I was told at another location that Cora's has access to a Florida orange grove for their juice (it's not fresh squeezed though)."}
{"text":"Best breakfast ever. Although, the cinnamon bread was a bit burnt, it still tasted great. They have the freshest fruit and delicious jams. Their bacon was pretty good as well. This is NOTHING compared to IHOP. I usually get a weird aftertaste with IHOP pancakes but not with the food here. Although, there was a bit of a wait, it was totally worth it. I don't remember the name of the item I ordered, but it came with cinnamon bread, an egg (that was rather small), bacon and fresh fruit. It was very filling and all around delicious. I tried my bf's crepes and although I can understand how they can be rubbery, they were not overly sweet like the ones I've eaten in America. I would def. come back again!"}
{"text":"J'adore !! Bon, j'avoue que je prends toujours la même chose, l'une des crêpes, Avril 89 ou Bananes-Choco. C'est toujours délicieux. Je ne suis pas une fan de leur décoration et les boissons pourraient être améliorés. Le service est ... ok. Sinon, j'adore !!! :)"}
{"text":"Second time I've been there, the wait for the food was long and restaurant wasn't even full. Asked for a simple accommodation because I'm vegan and didn't want yogurt in my smoothie so they denied it saying it changed the recipe, which I've done that at home it's not that hard to not use it, so I ended up eating  oatmeal and fruits that took 35 min to come 

Sadly I will not go there a 3rd time for sure"}
{"text":"I was SO excited to finally try Cora's and was quite disappointed.

The service was really unreasonably slow considering there was only 1 or 2 other tables. The waitress was polite but not friendly and quite often nowhere in site. 

Finally after 45 minutes when my breakfast arrive my poached eggs were pretty much hard boiled...to the point where it was almost too dry to chew. I just wanted to be done with the whole experience so I begrungingly paid and got the hell out of there."}
{"text":"We went to the Chez Cora on the plateau twice on Thanksgiving weekend (2017) with the parents in tow. Two waiters in particular were fantastic, Martin and François. They were attentive without being intrusive. Martin even remembered what Mom & Dad ordered the day before and asked if they would like to repeat. (they did) This sort of attention sits very well with seniors. In addition, all our dishes were prepared very well. At every Chez Cora outlet I've patronized, the coffee cups stay filled. This one was no different. We will definitely return the next time in Montreal."}
{"text":"SO good! The Gigi omelette (egg whites with veggies and goat cheese, served w gluten free bread and fruit) blew away any other breakfast dish I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"J'aime déjeuner chez Cora, mais celui de ma région fait pitié. Je valide mon constat à tout les années et ça ne change pas. 

On dirait qu'ils n'ont pas de motivation à cuisiner. J'ai commandé un omelette 10 étages. Ça c'est traduit par un film d'ufs avec une tonne d'oignons et de poivrons verts dessus. Ils ont trouvé le moyen de ne pas cuire les ufs et c'est plein d'eau à cause des légumes. Tous ça tient avec le fromage. 

C'est sale en plus... et le gars à la banquette d'à côté renifle profondément à la minute."}
{"text":"Chez Cora is a perfect place for brunch! The meals are given in reasonable portions, the food is fresh and delicious, and the waiters are rather attentive to their customers. Overall, I had a pleasant eating experience"}
{"text":"Zero stars because for two mornings in a row reception was so slow we got fed up waiting and went somewhere else. Plenty of empty tables, not enough staff. I've frequented Cora's places in Halifax without complaint, but this was a shambles!"}
{"text":"My favorite franchise out of all of them simply because of the location and my favorite seat near the window ! Service , food and drinks are ok"}
{"text":"Chez Cora is somewhat of a cookie cutter breakfast franchise.  The bright yellow smiley sun and cute cartoons that adorn the restaurant pretty much attracts the old people and families. The menu is in French and has pictures to accompany the dishes.

I opted for the Sassarin Surprise. It was 3 sausages wrapped in a buckwheat crepes accompanied by fruits. The fruits were like a boquet. The apple was cut like a flower, the watermelon was carved, the strawberries were sliced, etc. My only complaint was that the grapes were a little waxy. But overall, my dish was yummy and somewhat healthy.

The stand out dish at Chez Cora was the crepe. I have never seen a crepe that big before. It was like a Dosa from Vik's in Berkeley. The crepe was bigger than a footlong at Subway. And if you like chocolate, I think a whole jar of nutella was placed in this crepe. My friend had to scrape out the extra chocolate and put it in a bowl. 

Chez Cora was fun. The staff was really nice to us. We were a big group of 12. They were unable to seat us together so we just sat three tables in a row. Not a big deal. The whole joint is pretty casual."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The food was amazing. If you fine there everyday for your life, you would be the healthiest person ever. Even the coffee comes with a side of fruit!  The waiters and waitresses are like family, they're so nice! One of them have me a free smoothie because it took a bit of time to make my coffee. The best brunch restaraunt in Airdrie. Love it. I'm coming back!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious breakfast and brunch!  I recommend the eggs Benedict with Brie and mushrooms"}
{"text":"If you've just embarked on a rager the previous night and need some food to soak up the alcohol in your stomach, this is definitely a solid brunch choice.  If you're looking for something light and healthy, this is definitely not the spot.  Well, I guess they do have dishes that are all fruit, but there's no way you can resist all of the other offerings once you see other people digging in.  

I went with a crepe/omelette hybrid of some type smothered in hollandaise sauce, and yes it was good, though I think in my state that morning, anything with cream and fat would've been.  

Also, the service was very friendly, definitely not expected at a cheap run of the mill breakfast spot like this!"}
{"text":"Last day in Montreal, what to eat for breakfast?  We past by Chez Cora many times and there was always many people eating very good looking food. So why not give it a try instead of trekking out to St Laurent in search of breakfast on a cold day? 
There was a bit of a wait to be seated, but on we had our table by the window, our table was quickly set up and our very pleasant waitress handed us menus and coffee  a few minutes later. The menu had many options for crepes, and we opted for Lucie la Framboise and Sarrasin Surprise.   Both of our dishes came out in about 10 mins, very nicely plated and plentiful. Lucie is a crisp crepe filled with cheese and sweetened raspberries on top of raspberry couli, served with a tiny pitcher of Creme anglaise.  Sarrasin is for the healthy at heart who still enjoy a good sausage or two!  A delicious interpretation of pigs in a blanket.3 Buckwheat crepes rolled around 3 sausages, served with a fruit medley that was impressive - grapes, watermelon, banana, cantaloupe, pineapple and strawberries!  Both dishes were totally yummy, though we could not eat all the fruit.
We are both pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and will return next time we visit the city. Only down side is the price. A bit expensive, $33 for 2 meals and 2 coffees."}
{"text":"Service was great and there is a big selection of food.  There was no wait on a weekday late morning.  Based on others reviews I wanted some sort of eggs Benedict. They had about 4 to choose from and I settled on the smoked salmon Benedict.  A few things I love about this place: 1) you can choose 1, 2 or 3 eggs!  Depending on how hungry you are, you get to choose the size!  2) the plate came with a wide variety of fruit! Apple, Orange, pineapple, kiwi, banana, a strawberry, and cantaloupe. Keep this in mind when you pick how many eggs. 3) there's milk at the table for your coffee.  In the US, that rarely is the case. 4) side of potatoes is also good. 5) again, great service and quick turnaround.  I might come here everyday for breakfast while I am in town."}
{"text":"Yum. You get a lot of food for the price. Was really impressed. Come hungry! Portions are sizes are big! Get there early or you will be waiting outside!"}
{"text":"I don't care that this is a huge chain in Canada. To an American, this is epic, epic fare.

My first experience with Cora came during my first ever visit to Montréal. I was 20, and on a family vacation. My parents asked the hotel staff for a breakfast recommendation and they gave us Chez Cora. My oh my were we impressed.

Since, I have been back with every trip to Montréal (4 more times) and recently, we've found one near my sister's place in Toronto. So I would guestimate I've been to Cora 7 or 8 times now, each time with big success.

I always get the Avril 89, a beautiful display of assorted fruits wrapped tightly in a crêpe with nutella. It is to die for. I am usually ready for a food coma after downing an Avril 89, and I often do not find myself hungry for the next 6 or 7 hours. It is truly an awesome dining experience. People that I have eaten with have gotten various meals, from crêpes to fruit meals. Everything that I have seen come out of that kitchen is displayed with the most beautiful precision. Just take a look at the menu on their website and you'll see what I mean.

Inside, the decor is inviting and breakfasty, with that quirky Québec feel. It's safe to say, a trip to Canada is now incomplete without a trip to Chez Cora!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cora restaurants before and this one pretty much fit the bill. We went here because it was the first breakfast place we happened across and it was warm and inviting. The place is cheerful and the staff were friendly and helpful---always offering coffee or water refills. 

The great thing about Cora's is the fruit is always plentiful--you will definitely get some of your daily servings here. The crepes are big and full--I especially like their cream sauce. The savoury dishes have fairly large portions as well.

I always feel the tables are a bit too close together at Cora's and this location was no different. Overall a good experience though."}
{"text":"Nous allons à ce resto régulièrement. Nous sommes heureux d'aller manger un excellent déjeuner."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience.  You would think with all the wonderful breakfast restaurants popping up , chez Cora would have the insight to step it up.  

The napkins at my table were dirty (obviously recycled) which made me wonder.... 

The coffee was stale and when I asked for a small adjustment to the menu I was told \"non, c'est pas possible!  Mme Cora ne nous laisse pas!\"... in French of course because the manager did not know a word of English!!! Shocker.

The overall experience left a bad taste in my mouth and a hole in my wallet!   Over priced garbage I will never, ever frequent this store...or chain, ever again."}
{"text":"While visiting from the US for a conference, my classmates and I were desperately craving for some healthy food. We get enough of the tasty, fatty foods at lunches and dinners, so Cora was a perfect place for breakfast! 

I don't normally eat many fruits, but I'm a fan of the Cora chain of restaurants. The strawberries are sweet, the bananas are perfectly ripe, and everything is cut to perfection. I ordered the Sarrasin Surprise and then the Surprise during my two breakfasts here. Both were delicious.

Many of us wished deeply that Cora would expand to the US! We could use some healthier breakfast options!"}
{"text":"Chez Cora is a homey place that I miss coming to, as the Kingston, ON location closed some time ago. Being in Montreal begs for something more chic, but to heck with that - we went to Cora's! 

Wait time was about 15 minutes around 10:30am on a Saturday. The line is long, but the staff certainly are efficient. I can't complain about service time once seated, either; things were speedy and efficient. 

The coffee is bottomless, the choices are comforting, and the staff are very friendly. If you don't mind a really busy atmosphere, it's not a bad breakfast pick."}
{"text":"Traditionnelle chaîne au QC et partout au Canada, Cora propose des brunchs classiques, mais bons et abordables!
Le menu est très varié, il a des choix de plats d'ufs (bénédictines ou non), des crêpes (salées ou sucrées), des assiettes de fruits ou des yogurt, des sandwichs, bref, il y en a pour tous les goûts!
Les prix varient de 9 à 15$ environ, ce qui est raisonnable!
Les fruits sont frais.
Seule déception: je n'avais vraiment pas beaucoup de patates dans mon assiette...
Service ok
A essayer car c'est un classique!"}
{"text":"Was here again today, service was a fair bit better, very few screaming children.
Food was average and expensive but it was a lot more comfortable to sit and enjoy our tea and eggs benny.    I tried the mushroom & brie eggs benny at $16.99 - nothing special or terribly good but it was totally passable."}
{"text":"It's a basic Chez Cora except it's smaller than most of the others.
This is on the Plateau, so most stores are small.
That said, nice decor, the same menu as in all the others in the chain.
Lots of staff for a busy Saturday morning   :-)"}
{"text":"Really need an ability to rate in between the whole numbers - this was 4.5 star experience.

Just looking at the reviews below, I can't comment on the service (we had no issues with ours, may be except a tad longer wait for the check to arrive), but when they say it is \"just ok\" food or \"just ok\" breakfast, I'm really curious what they consider \"good\" food....

Food was impeccable, fresh, lots (did I say lots) of fresh fruit with every dish. I never had better Eggs Benedict - hollandaise sauce was just perfectly balanced and whole execution of the dish was outstanding. Western omelette was also very good.

Definitely recommended place for breakfast, especially if you are traveling with kids."}
{"text":"Cora is fantastic for breakfast. It is a fast growing Quebec restaurant chain for breakfast and lunch. 
Breakfast is the bomb. They service fresh crepes with all types of fresh fruits and berries. 
I had crepes with filled with honey and sweet creme topped with a ton of red raspberries. 
So good. Cute waiters here, as this location is in the heart of the gay village. 
I have also been to the one in Victoriaville."}
{"text":"Le chocolat chaud était bien bon!
Le passe partout jambon était pas mal, avec de bon fruits bien frais.
La bedaine était correcte, dommage qu'il y avait de la sauce blanche"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is slow if you can call it service. Waits of 30 minutes from ordering to arrival of your food is not uncommon.  Sadly, I can't write a positive recommendation for this restaurant."}
{"text":"What has happened to my Chez Cora? About three years ago Cora was delicious, my favorite was the now closed one on Rue Sherbrooke. I came to this location, desperately craving some English Cream Cora Style. Such disappointment ensued. 

My French isn't perfect, but it's good enough for a girl from Cleveland with a dad from Montreal. The waitress greeted us in French, I responded. She asked what we wanted to drink, I responded. She ignored me and stared at my boyfriend, who was clueless and relied on my translations for most of our trip. She then started speaking English, meanly, still ignoring me. I ordered some coffee and then some water because my breakfast was dry. The water was lukewarm, without ice. No refills on water were given to my boyfriend or me. I at least had coffee to drink, but the bf only had his empty water glass for his entire meal. 

I ordered the current special during mid-August, the crunchy crepe. It was horrible. The crepe was mostly empty. The fruit that came with it was sparse. I had no water to help wash down the dry crepe. Even coffee wasn't helping. Our waitress had officially disappeared. 30 minutes later, she pops back to ask if we need anything else. We nicely ask for more water and the check. 20 more minutes pass, no check. No water. We finally get her attention so we can pay and leave. We were really hoping someone else at the register would've helped us so we would have felt better about tipping her what she actually deserved. Since she rang us out, she got more than we wanted to give her on our credit card transaction. 

My fond memories of Cora are just that: fond memories. I'm not sure if I'll return next time I'm visiting my family. I'll probably go somewhere else. But at least they have free wireless!"}
{"text":"I did enjoy my breakfast. Nice and clean...
The service was really good and definitely i will come here sooon"}
{"text":"This used to be a great place. They stopped innovating, and have gotten complacent. Food was cold, and the portions are measly compared to the price. It's still an okay place for a cup of coffee and a simple breakfast, but it's nothing like some of the more recent entrants into the breakfast space."}
{"text":"With so many better breakfast places to go to in the city, there's no reason to go to Quebec's version of Denny's. Okay, it's better than Denny's but the food is greasy, the place is dirty, and it's overpriced. Luke B.'s review hit the nail on the head except not everything is overcooked - the two times I've eaten there, the potatoes were practically raw.  People don't seem to mind though since there's often lineups on weekends."}
{"text":"Mon spot préféré pour déjeuner dans le village. Les fruits sont toujours frais et le service est très rapide. J'ai très hâte que la rue Sainte-Catherine devient piétonne pour qu'ils est encore leur terrasse. J'ai toujours la même omelette pour déjeuner soit celle pour les intolérants au gluten."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, such fast friendly service.  The menu is huge large selections for everyone, gluten free, healthy options and of course classic breakfast staples.  I ordered eggs Bennie with bacon, tomato, green pinion.  You can order how many eggs you want I got 1, you can get up to 3.  Came with fresh fruit!"}
{"text":"We ordered 4 breakfast plates to go and they got one order wrong - mine. What I did get wasn't above edible, my sister commented she wouldn't order anything besides eggs and bacon because she never really liked anything she's had from there. She's probably right, the crepe I had was too thick and gummy, and missing a main filling component. What a disappointment. Since it was take-away I wasn't going to go back and have it corrected, so I jazzed it up with syrup from home."}
{"text":"Dropping my review to a 3-star. While the food is still generally excellent, my visit today was less than stellar. Our waitress visited our table a total of four times: to take our drink order on arrival, to deliver drinks, to take our order, and to drop off food. When we got up to pay, I mentioned to the hostess the lack of service (and coffee refills), and the hostess got our waitress...who then got into our face about her poor service, and took $5 off our bill...not even the price of the two coffees that were never refilled. 

I plan on checking out Eggs Oasis next time I go for breakfast."}
{"text":"Never again. 

Went for brunch on a holiday Monday, not packed but not empty. Waited 10 minutes for a waitress to realize our existence. She took our order and didnt return until about 40mins later when she said our food was almost ready. I asked for a coffee as I felt it may be longer.

Food was awful. Eggs weren't cooked, potatoes mushy, and bacon was thin and so overcooked it just fell apart. I did tell the waitress I wasnt satisfied with any of it and she did apologize and bring me a side of less burnt bacon, but it was a terrible experience.

Paid the bill, which she didnt charge us for coffee, that was good. 

When the staff complains about the food and they work there, it must be an ongoing problem. 

I will find somewhere else in this city to have brunch."}
{"text":"Decent place to a quick and decent brunch....can help but feel a little ripped off by the pricing though."}
{"text":"I only went here cause it was the closest French restaurant where I was staying, as it was a walking distance to here. The menu had a wide variety of entrees to choose from. It almost seemed like I was in a Denny's or Norm's diner. The food was average. What turned me off mostly was the fact that my waitress was taking advantage of me with the bill. I had brought Canadian money in advance for my trip. The waitress said that on the bill I should add a tip, as she lectured me that other restaurants will take advantage of me if I don't look at the bill carefully. The bill had already added the tax and tip and yet she said it didn't. I do not recommend anyone to go here whatsoever."}
{"text":"I was actually introduced to this place on my trip up there last year, and convinced my cousins to go there this year (and we ended up going twice)..  This is almost as an American style breakfast diner as you can get, but with excellent Canadian food.  The crepes are amazing.  I don't think there was a single complaint from anyone about the food.  And they have creton..  I've had canned creton, and fresh made, and this is fresh made, nice, creamy, just the right flavor.  This is the place everyone on our bus stops at for breakfast, and I'm sure we'll be stopping again and again.  Also, depending on what you get, the price can vary from one $ to 2 $$ in the \"price range\" section, but well worth whatever it is."}
{"text":"Waited 1 hour for food!  Someone ordered Benedict no cheese and a bowl with 2 poached eggs arrived! My sunny side up were runny.  $40 for 2 breakfasts and coffee! Waitress didn't even speak English! Ill never go back here again. Worst breakfast ever."}
{"text":"I never like franchised places because standards are very commercialized. I had a waffle with strawberries, and waffles were nothing special, a bit chewy if I must say. I think I can make better ones at home. Food wise it's a nay, but I love the cute and fun decor and the atmosphere. Staff is very friendly and wise and they have clean washrooms. I'm torn to rate this based on food or environment+ service, but I'm there to eat, so i'll put a 2.5-3/5. If you're not picky like me on the quality of waffles and just want food, this is the place to go. Large portions and plenty of fruit options."}
{"text":"I am not going to spend a lot of time writing this review as I have wasted enough time with my experience at this restaurant.  Basically it was an unnecessarily long wait for a table due to staff not cleaning up tables quickly.  It is sad that this is how some restaurants control how many tables of guest are dinning in their restaurant at a time.  The restaurant was maybe 75% full and yet we had to wait 20 minutes for table.  Next the food took another 40-45 minutes to arrive after ordering.  It seemed like an eternity for food to arrive and people that ordered way after us had their food either before us or soon after us.  It was a little ridiculous to be honest.  Some of the potatoes and toast were burnt.  The bacon strips were thin, overcooked and felt apart.   Then an item that we forgot about that didn't come was on the bill.  That was taken care of by the server.  In my opinion, the kitchen is the big problem here and it reflects poorly on how this location is managed."}
{"text":"One of the better if not best Breakfast Chain restaurants in Canada. The portions are amazing and they tend to include a lot of fresh fruit. COFFEE is a little weak but it's Included with a lot of dishes. The menu is quite large and took a while to go through. From Crepes to omelette to waffles they do it all. Everyone ordered something different at our four top table and everything was fresh.. hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Great location, fast and friendly service, delicious (very LARGE sized portions!) food, great value for what you get. I got the chocolate and banana crepe - fantastic, about what you would get at a creperie. Plenty leftovers for the next morning - still just as good. Highly recommend for cheap breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"Chez Cora c'est bien si c'est le seul resto à déjeuner des environs. Mais avec toute la compétition qu'il y a à moins d'un kilomètre de cette succursale, Chez Cora sur Mont Royal ne fait pas le poids. Mais un peu partout ça revient au même avec cette chaîne: On paye pour de la nourriture vraiment moyenne. Les patates ne sont pas siiiiii fantastiques, et les crêpes sont bonnes mais grosseur \"je-vais-exploser-mais-c'est-du-sucre-donc-je-termine-de-manger\". Le café goûte l'eau et personnellement je trouve que le sucre à la crème rendu à la caisse c'est un peu too much. Vous êtes pas au courant que tout le monde ressort en roulant de votre restaurant tellement ils ont mangé? Sauf si tu commandes un yogurt et granola, à ce moment là peut-être que tu as encore faim, mais ça m'étonnerais que tu te prennes du sucre à la crème pour te féliciter d'être resté raisonnable pour déjeuner, ça pèterait un peu le concept santé de ton repas. Quoi que j'imagine que ça doit plaire à certaines personnes. Bref je m'éloigne.

Pratique pour les grands groupes et les déjeuners avec grand-maman, grand-papa et le petit cousin de 2 ans. Mais sinon, profitez de la belle variété de restaurants du plateau, vous aurez mieux pour votre argent."}
{"text":"There are a million breakfast places in Montreal that serve this stuff (or better) for less than Chez Cora charges...
If you don't take chances on other places, for sure you'll think this is the best breakfast ever..."}
{"text":"Chez Cora...

Because sometimes you want an American-sized meal in Montreal.  

_C$"}
{"text":"Service : horrible! c'est peut-être juste notre serveuse aussi... Très mauvais expérience! 
Elle s'est trompé dans notre commande. Nous avons attendu notre facture pendant 15 min avant qu'elle nous dise qu'elle ne retrouvait plus la facture dans son système! Donc 15 autre minutes pour la retrouver et entres elle est revenue nous demander ce que l'on avait commander, car évidemment elle ne l'avait pas bien pris en note....

Menu ordinaire; ça reste des oeufs et du bacon!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here on yelp my friend and I went to Cora to eat breakfast/brunch.
We ordered Waffle Strawberry Mountain and Crepes with Nutella and Banana. It tasted really good!
They give a huge portion, which could be split between 2 persons because otherwise, you will probably get a stomach ace. Good service, its an old childhood feeling being there with all of the designs (old cereal packages and so)."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Cora. It's the first meal I ate when I arrived in Montreal. Fresh fruit and good eggs were in abundance. A solid breakfast place. Nothing to write home about but solid service and good food. Would return again."}
{"text":"Came to Canada for the first time this past weekend for a wedding and the immediate family (party of 10) needed breakfast the next morning. We came to the right place! Everyone ordered food ranging from crepes to pancakes to French toast and NOT one single complaint (even from my quite bougie aunt, which is a miracle Yelpers!). I had their scrambled eggs, French toast, bacon, and sliced potatoes (made the combo up myself) and everything was perfect. My French toast was evenly sprinkled with cinnamon and fluffy, my scrambled eggs were good, my bacon was cripsy, and the roasted fingerling potatoes were yummy.

All in all, for a great breakfast in Canada, visit Chez Cora!"}
{"text":"Was in town with my husband who was attending a conference. Needed good breakfast to tide me over until we met for supper. Being diabetic, I was looking for a meal that was filling but not high in refined carbs. Chez Cora filled the bill! Had 3 different meals on consecutive mornings. The last day I decided I MUST share the visual effect of it all as well!"}
{"text":"Never heard of this place and went here for breakfast and was so pleasantly surprised with the quality, price and convenience (it was right next to our hotel) that I went back the very next day!

Very solid breakfast. Omelettes were great. Portions plentiful. The potatoes as well as the nice fruit made the breakfast a winner. My son had the eggs& toast one day and blueberry crepes the next.  Coffee was very good. 

THEN after coming home, I found out it was a chain! I must say, I was surprised..."}
{"text":"I am so happy that \"poutine déjeuner\" exists. This is what breakfast aspires to be, so all other breakfasts should really stop trying, because we've found the platonic ideal. Breakfast potatoes with bell peppers, sausages and bacon pieces, poutine cheese, hollandaise sauce, topped with an egg - I mean, every bite is heaven."}
{"text":"The food is ok,but the service needs to be improved. Waiting to get seated could take up to 20 minutes. Then having your order get taken takes another 10 minutes.

I noticed that there are quite a few complaints here for the service and it's understaffed situation, but evidently the establishment doesn't think it's a problem."}
{"text":"Went here for a brunch with a fellow co-worker. Never been a huge fan of Chez Cora when it was all the rage back in the day but a little brunch won't hurt.

Ordered what you see below in the picture.

Breakfast was decent. Nothing out of the originary, eggs were what they were, sausages were OK, bacon was good, the potatoes were average, the bread was surprisingly good... all in all... decent.

Nothing that comes close to Allo Mon Coco though.

Service was decent enough. Prices looked decent but didn't pay, it's was my coworker's turn to pay.

Would I come again? Not in the immediate future but I'd like to try something else, possibly their crepes or their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Fun menu and good food, it was nice for a quick breakfast. I got a crepeomlete(eggs, spinach, and cheddar wrapped in a crepe and covered in hollandaise) and it tasted good. The service was prompt but the waitress seemed a bit reluctant to speak english to us. The presentation was very neat though, the towers of cut fruit looked incredible! For a local-seeming chain it is definitely a good choice"}
{"text":"I think my girl hyped this place up too much.  She had gone to Montreal the year before and SWORE BY IT.  It was our last morning in Montreal before getting back on the road to head back home, so I made a point of eating there before I left.  Honestly?  It was just Denny's with crepes.  Nothing fancy. Ok - maybe Baker's Square with crepes.  Would I go again? Sure.  But I definitely wouldn't expect anything more than a solid effort at breakfast food.  It's really just \"ok\""}
{"text":"Let's start with a story... The experience first started in Montreal in search of the best breakfast... I was in Montreal for a work conference and Rice Bucket came to join me over the weekend for a mini vacation. We were on a mission to find the best brunch in Montreal. The concierge recommended Cora's in Du Village (aka The Gay Village) along Rue Ste-Catherine Est. We did our research and Cora's had raving reviews.  Little did we realize that Cora's was 10 long blocks away from the hotel...


We walked the 'East Hastings' of Montreal, we saw cathedrals, poverty, two guys fighting over a backpack, another lying on the side of the street... slightly intrigued yet slightly nervous... Light came on the other side of the tunnel when we arrived Cora's.  The place is filled of sunshine (literally sunny logo, yellow decor and cheerful staff)...
 
 
The food is tasty and the egg is truly incredible with so many variations to a hearty breakfast - egg benny, omelette, crepes, waffles; you name it! The portions are huge! Most entrees comes with toast (pre-buttered, and a choice of sourdough, whole grain, white, etc... )... sometimes, you just don't feel like pancakes!
Spinach and Cheddar Omelette

Omelette made with bacon, ham, sausages, Frankfurters, bologna, spinach, green onions, tomatoes, onions, red peppers, green peppers, mushrooms and Cheddar, served with roasted potatoes and toast.
Eggs Ben et Dictine

Two poached eggs on an English muffin covered with Hollandaise sauce, served with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit.


The ironic part was this experience was that Dave discovered later at night, Cora's wasn't a stand-alone diner; but was a chain with a franchises all over Canada and one located in Coquitlam (less than 10min walk from home!!) ... oh, irony, how I love you!

So... we occasionally return to Cora's not just for a hearty delish brunch but also for nostalgic reasons... sometimes for a good laugh...


Apparantely, if you go to Cora's website there was some madness to our adventure...
The adventure began in May 1987, when Cora bought a small diner in Montreal's Saint Laurent district. After just a few months of operation, Cora changed the diner mission, making breakfasts her specialty. Combining fruit, cheese, cereal, omelettes, crepes and French toast, culinary magician Cora started a whole new breakfast concept in Quebec.
 
Ham  & Swiss Cheese Omelette
Omelette made with ham and swiss cheese, served with roasted potatoes and toast.
 
10 Star - Egg in a Skillet au Gratin  
Skillet with an egg on a bed of potatoes, served with fresh fruit and toast. Bacon, ham, sausages, Frankfuters, bologna, spinach, green onions, tomatoes, onions, red/green peppers, mushrooms and cheddar.

They have daily smoothie specials - today's was mango, pineapple and banana!
The table next to us had the bagel with smoked salmon, served with a heaping pile of fruit which looked absolutely amazing and also a cinnamon brioche made French Toast served with an egg, bacon and also more fruits. I guess I know what to order next time I (we) return... au reviour!


p.s. come early because this place gets really busy, esp on the weekends!
p.p.s. their coffee is apparently more expensive than a Stabucks grande drip coffee..."}
{"text":"I try to get breakfast here every time that I visit Montreal.  The food is great and the service is usually great also.  Prices are a little higher than I like but not extremely high.

They chain should consider expanding south of the border.  I think that this type of place would be very well received."}
{"text":"It seemed like the Denny's of Montreal. Mediocre breakfast. The type of place that isn't bad, but the type of place you go to when you have no other better options."}
{"text":"Dirty cutlery, water served at room temperature (tasted like tap water), bottom half of nutella/banana crepe hard (day-old?), scrambled eggs were half-cooked. Very disappointing experience since we last ate there 2 years ago. I could have made something better at home for a lot less $$."}
{"text":"The food was good and service great. I ate there twice during my vacation and enjoyed both meals."}
{"text":"I went to Chez Cora last weekend with my husband, it was a planned brunch and I hate to admit I was as excited as a 12 year old being introduced to Candy Crush. This place is a sacred old gem, extremely reasonable, generous portions and the most appealing fruit bowl. 

There were way too many choices, I spent a good 15mins just going back and forth between omelettes/ waffles or pancakes. The food was brought to us in no time, the staff were quick and friendly. Though this place looks a bit run down, the bottomless cup of coffee makes up for everything. The omelettes were delicious, I became the biggest fan of their hollandaise sauce and I enjoyed every bit of it. 

I highly recommend this place to everyone looking for a scrumptious breakfast that is worth every cent."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for coffee an hour to get our breakfast , tables that rock with uneven legs.  Rude staff and inattentive wait staff. Lousy experience and I won't be eating here agai"}
{"text":"Similar to IHOP if you're an American/have been to an IHOP before. Same kind of quality and type of menu. Not that impressive, but fine for a standard breakfast at a chain restaurant"}
{"text":"What a nice place to come eat at!  It just reminded me of back home, Dallas, Texas.  The only thing that got me by surprise was that they offer Baked Beans for breakfast.  

Note:  In Texas, we eat Baked Beans for lunch or dinner usually with BBQ.  

So, what the heck!  Why not!?  I tried them with my Bacon && Eggs...they sure were good!  :)  Every time I come visit Montreal...this would be one of the places I'll come back to visit."}
{"text":"Breakfast and brunch place that is huge, reminded me of a ihop.  Got the crepe dejeuner platter which came with crepes with cheese, 2 sunnyside eggs, 2 sausage and 2 bacon slices and a side of fruits.  It was pretty good.  I really liked the mocha café and the coffee.  Good portion size, good service.  I'd come back again.  Also tried the breakfast burrito and it was good."}
{"text":"Noticed that the Cora was attached to the Best Western that I was staying and decided to go there for breakfast this morning. Came in, the waitress was cheerful and asked us if we preferred French or English. My sister replied French for her, English for me. We were then quickly seated and asked what we would like to drink. For me definitely coffee.

I ordered the ham & Swiss savoury crepe while my sister ordered the original crepe (crepe nature) w/sausage along with a side of maple syrup. Both dishes came with one strawberry, a slice of cantaloupe and a slice of pineapple. My crepe had about three slices of ham and promptly covered in melted Swiss cheese, folded in half then two slice of Swiss cheese melted on top. I ate about half of it without maple syrup just to get the taste then added the syrup... definitely eat with the syrup lol. We were in a bit of a rush so we scarfed down so fast and quickly pay and left. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"I had a strawberry crepe with strawberries and custard for breakfast. The food and service were good, but It is not a place I would make plans to return to."}
{"text":"Chez Cora is an awesome option for gluten free breakfast, I found gluten free breakfast hard to come by in Montreal.  Loved the outdoor seating, free coffee and gluten free bread!  Good portion sizes so brunch filled me up until 5pm ish."}
{"text":"This place is like a Perkins or a Village Inn.  Good unhealthy breakfast food as long as you order right.  I went by the descriptions and the picture but what I got was different.  I thought it was going to be the spinach and cheese omelet with a crepe wrapped around it.  It was but it was drowning in fake movie theater nacho cheese.  Normally I'd love that sort of thing but I have to say --- it was too much!  Had I known I would have said nacho cheese on the side or even 86 it since there was cheese inside.  Its clean, the coffee is good, and the staff is friendly.  Its one of those places where you bring the check up to a register to pay.  We did wait a really REALLY long time for our food."}
{"text":"This place gets packed so get there early. 

We stayed in the hotel Best Western Europea. This rest is on the ground floor of the hotel. The food was Ok, the servers were very busy and got my order wrong but i was so hungry it didn't matter.

I had a. Crep-omelet and my hubby had a cinnamon roll with a egg on top ? He said it was good and I tasted the cinnamon roll portion it was fresh and homemade. Total price with coffee $24."}
{"text":"Closed. Next nearest location is at the Best Western on Rue Drummond. I feel they lost something during the move. I don't enjoy the food as much in their new location."}
{"text":"Chez Cora kind of reminds me of IHop a little or maybe another restaurant chain. It is pretty decent and they have a lot of choices. Of course, me being the fatty I am, kept getting the eggs benedict everywhere I went. Got them here and they were pretty decent, nothing to write home about but definitely a great place for families with kids."}
{"text":"Sheite!
 Really, I've been to Cora's before....but this particular one was absolutely shit.
 My breakfast came half burnt, half swimming in grease. Clearly they don't have quality control there, because well, it came like that. Cora's is kinda known for being healthy (ie. fresh fruit) and not greasy.
 The wait staff seemed lackadaisical at best, apathetic at worst.
 $30 later, I was really unhappy."}
{"text":"Me and my family stayed the night in Montreal and decided to have breakfast there! Definitely one of the best breakfasts I had in a while! The food was absolutely delicious, we loved the fresh fruit and the staff was super sweet!!! Would love to go back some day!"}
{"text":"It's been several years since I've stopped by Chez Cora and the memory that stands out most vividly are the fake chickens used to decorate the place, starring at you with their little beady eyes as you consume huge platters of eggs, bacon, and fresh fruit salads.
This place was recommended by the hotel concierge. Yes, I was a tourist."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this breakfast style restaurant, lots of pretty fruit on every plate.

Food was tasty.

Price was as expected.

Salads are only Monday-Friday?

Booth was a sticky mess.

Service was a bit slow, had to keep flagging the waitress down, in the beginning, but it got better towards the end."}
{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant for breakfast as it was close to my dad's place and wanted to take him for breakfast.  A friend suggested it.   The portions were very good but the food was bland, the pancakes rubbery, and the coffee watery.  I would not eat here again.  There are places with much better breakfast fare in Montreal for slightly more money."}
{"text":"For a breakfast chain, Cora reigns supreme. Mounds of fresh fruit, artfully cut and arranged on every breakfast platter makes you feel a little better about the eggs, cheese & hollandaise wrapped in your giant crepe. The hand-made menus are super-cute. You won't go home hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!  And, best of all, when they say \"fresh fruit\" on the menu, they actually mean fresh fruit!  I am from New York and I am used to all fruit usually tasting pretty much the same at restaurants.  But here, each kind of fruit tastes like it should.  And, the crepes are to die for.  I am going to visit Montreal again in a couple weeks and will definitely be paying a visit to Chez Cora!  Plus it is fairly inexpensive, which is good if you are on a budget.  And, this location in the gay part of town, is very safe and clean.  It is also within a couple blocks of the bus station, making it a very convenient stop for travellers."}
{"text":"(I'm a tourist in Montreal from Los Angeles) Magnificent, warm and friendly service for our big family! The food is absolutely perfect,  huge portions, and beautifully garnished!  We were treated so well as we were assured a quick table as the owner, Lino, saw we were waiting outside and it was raining,  he brought us in with a smile.  Michel was so energetic,  friendly and wore a bright smile on his face as he made sure our table had everything it needed!  Thank you for making our travels memorable.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Oh, how I love this place. Honestly, the best breakfast joint I have ever been to. 

I love that you can get an artery clogging platter, or a big plate of fruit. There's something for everyone here, and the prices are fair. We had great service and now I understand why people line up for hours in Toronto to eat at the Cora's here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

Easily my favorite brunch place in Montreal. It was next door to me when I was staying at the Sheraton for conference. The breakfast is fresh and delicious, and you get quite a lot of food for the price. (Especially compared to the $19.99+ breakfast price tag at Sheraton) Since I'm a fruit fanatic, I love the food combination at Cora with huge sides of fruits. The food is decent, we ordered cinnamon bun and bacon topped with a lot of fruits as well as egg/sausage/bacon with hash browns. The atmosphere is quite relaxing, a great place for friends to social in the morning.

Nothing exquisite, just simple delicious relaxing food."}
{"text":"Le service a été excellent et servi en français pour moi et en anglais pour mon ami! Les portions sont grosses et valent le prix sans problème. Je recommande vivement ce lieu pour les déjeuners et les brunchs..."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would.  Poor service long waits for food.  Went for breakfast. My husband ordered bacon and eggs. He was finished with breakfast and waitress comes up with piece of bacon on a plate saying this was some of your bacon.  For such high food prices I would expect a better quality all round service.  However I don't expect to ever go to any Coras anytime soon.  This is second one I have experienced and it is not a chain I will spend my money in"}
{"text":"The food was good, reasonably priced and service was okay. The ambience was nice, and it was very busy for brunch.  Music was not too loud, and we had a good time. It is a decent place, and the sandwiches, waffles, and pancakes our group ordered were tasty."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Denny's in America.  Its a diner located in a hotel and came here for a quick lunch.  Had the savory crepes that exceeded my expectations and their fruit crepes were good too!  Very fresh and very french!"}
{"text":"Foods always delicious, our server Alain is always wonderful and exceptional at his job."}
{"text":"Ewwww.... this place is NOT so good.  Rubbery crepes, overcooked everything, SUPER sweet fruit toppings. Big, ridiculous menus...  It's like IHOP but in Canada.  The food quality is REAL bad.  Stick with bagels for breakfast if you're in Montreal. Or coffee and croisant."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for breakfast in Montreal.  It's not too far off the main street (St. Catherine's), and the place is huge!  There's a big sign out front, but you might walk right past the entrance like we did, as it's attached to the Best Western hotel. 

The breakfast menu is ginormous with tons of options -- several yogurt & granola dishes, eggs, omelettes, crepes, waffles, pancakes, bagels, and even a gluten-free. 

I had my eye on the omelette section, but being in Montreal (with so may French influences), I wanted to try the crepes. Lucky for me, they created a dish here that combines both into a Crepomolette! It was delicious, with eggs, spinach, Swiss cheese and Hollandaise sauce. It comes with a side dish of fresh fruit, which they carve into beautiful little works of art. 

There's nothing fancy about this place, in fact it looks almost like a fancy Denny's. But the service was excellent, and the prices are very reasonable (especially with the favorable US exchange rate!), and the food was delicious. I will certainly come back the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"With all the charm and allure of a Denny's, Chez Cora was recommended by not one, but two of our friends on places to get a decent breakfast at in Montreal.  I wasn't thoroughly disappointed; the food was fine and the service was fast, but I couldn't get over the fact that this place that was well regarded by everyone we had talked to before coming to Montreal was essentially Denny's.  I'm not a big fan of Denny's if you haven't figured it out.

We started by looking over the menu, which had many different choices for all things breakfast.  Despite this, I couldn't decide on what I wanted simply because nothing truly sounded appealing.  I settled for a spinach and cheddar crepe.  It was fine: savory and salty, and surprisingly good with a little maple syrup.  The BF's apple and cheddar crepe didn't taste quite as good in my opinion, but it was fine.  Nothing to write home about though.

I was also surprised that coffee wasn't included in the cost of our meal, whereas a six-and-a-half dollar simple eggs and meat breakfast included it.  The pricing structure is a little weird, and all in all I found breakfast to be a little more expensive than I would have bargained for.  Overall, meh experience and would probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"J'adore les restaurants chez Cora. Je sais c'est un classique, mais je peux vous assurer que c'est le restaurant le plus généreux en matière de fruits ils en mettent à profusion et prennent le temps de les couper de façon à rendre le plat si beau presque artistique (oui je suis fan haha). Je viens régulièrement à celui du village, on me sert avec plaisir les employés sont tous agréables et serviables et je dirais que cela se ressent dans la majorité des succursales. J'ai mes plats favoris que je commande encore et encore là récolte 90, le seven of July ou encore le panini crêpe une de leur création que j'apprécie vraiment la crêpe est servie tel un panini et est garnie d'oeuf, bacon et fromage. Idéal pour les groupes, les familles, les enfants adorent et même les touristes l'apprécient."}
{"text":"Came here to have a bite with some friends who were in town. It wasn't my personal choice of place to eat compared to some amazing competition on Montreal. I was apprehensive of this specific member of the Chez Cora chain being located in a hotel near the Bell Center.

I ordered their 7th of July and it was nothing special. The fruits were fresh but the crepes were rather bland and unexciting. For the price tag, I expected more fruits and the crepes to have some gusto. I guess not.

Service was very slow and inattentive. It took ages to get coffee, coffee refills and the check. Seriously, should I be asking for the check thrice so that we can pay to leave when dozens of people are waiting at the door?

Should I mention I shouldn't ask twice for the Maple Syrup as well? And speaking of that, can I get the genuine stuff instead of the cheap stuff? We are after all, IN CANADA.

GIVE ME CANADA'S BLOOD GOOD SIR.

A Canadian knows full well when the Maple Syrup being offered is of the inferior race of maple syrups!

You pay for your meal at the register, rather than with your server, which is a PITA! There was a line at least 15 people waiting to pay when we went up to pay. 

Like a previous yelper said... nothing like waiting in line for a quarter of an hour to pay for a mediocre meal..."}
{"text":"I ordered a panini crepe with fresh fruits. The fruits were rotten. I have to say that the cook must have been a douche (pardon my expression) because it was very visible that they were bad. 
Service was ok. 
18$ for a coffee and a crepe..."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite Cora's location so far. The fruit was fresh, the service was courteous and attentive and the gluten free option was delicious."}
{"text":"2 stars seems a bit harsh because overall the food is okay. But that's the thing with Breakfast restaurant: they can try too much. This is again, another franchise  that's quite popular in Quebec. They've even got some market place in the supermarket. It's a single Woman from Gaspésie that created that company after having some hard financial time. It was a immediate success. The menu is friendly and well done. The variety of meals are pretty big and overall it taste pretty good. But when you go to any diners in the State or Tim Hortons here, will never cost you more than 12$ for a whole breakfast. At Cora, it's pretty much 12$ per item. So it's like 50-70% more expensive then any other breakfast. I got no problems on having some people selling 4-5 times the cost of the meal (standard is Cost X 3 in the business) but when you're selling a pancake with some pretty regular ham and some canadian swiss cheese with some freshly press orange juice 18-20$ COME ON!  My main concerns with them is that in this economical crisis, a review of the concept and price would definetly give a boom to the concept."}
{"text":"So much fruit with the breakfast meals!! I have to admit having an allergy to kiwi I was nervous because every pic of food I saw on their website had kiwis in it. Our server was great and made sure that everyone at our table had fresh fruit salad (no kiwi) so we could try each others food without worrying about me!

Prices were pretty good. It was 36CAD for two breakfasts, OJ, and a Mochacino.

We will definitely be coming back tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"Chez Cora is the kind of place you go when you want quantity not quality.  They certainly give you large portions that will fill you up but the food is just average.  They have a pretty wide selection of dishes but none of them really stand out.  

Usually I get La Recolte 90 which is a cinnamon brioche served up with bacon, an egg and a ton of fresh fruit.  I do enjoy the large portion of fruit but everything else seems just okay.  The bacon is never very crispy and the brioche is only so so.  I've also never been a fan of their pancakes.  They're never very fluffy and are on the bland side.  The same goes for their potatoes which could also do with some seasoning. 

The prices aren't very good either especially in Montreal where there are many other brunch places that serve up better food for lower prices.  Service is also sometimes on the slow side which can be frustrating.  Getting things like water and coffee refills can take time which is kind of annoying."}
{"text":"This is a pretty dependable spot for breakfast or brunch. 
Service is fast and friendly, there is plenty of seating, and the food arrives quickly, which is fantastic when one has young kids like I do. We enjoy ordering the breakfast crepe burrito as well as the waffles with strawberries and crème anglaise. The kids enjoy the panini with ham and egg as well. Fruit is very generously doled out on breakfast plates.
We've been to this location, as well as to the Beaconsfield Cora, several times. Both locations have not let us down when the brunch craving hits."}
{"text":"Great food. I had the buckwheat crepe. It was excellent."}
{"text":"I go there on each visit in Montréal for years. Their breakfast are top! Good quantities and good quality as well.
The staff is always very nice and accommodating. 
I usually take their egg benedicts with Swiss asparagus (not sure they really come from Switzerland..lol) and I am ne we disappointed. They come with potatoes and a lot of fresh fruits"}
{"text":"Cora is a lot like the US-ubiquitous IHOPs and Denny's, but unlike most chains, it has a lot of healthier options. Came here before embarking on the half-day Wine Tour of Quebec and the food filled me up for hours. I recommend the whole wheat toasted bagel with lox. It comes with capers, red onion (although a little too much for my liking) and tomatoes all on the bagel. I adore they way they cut up and present all the fruits with the breakfasts! And I'm not just referring to your standard run of the mill fruits like bananas, berries, and apples...you'll get kiwis, mangoes and tropical star fruits as well! They're like cute little fruit diorammas...

Easily accessible via metro Peel or Guy Concordia. There was no wait, probably because we arrived early but around 11am the place starts packing out...and with a lot of Longuyland-native look-alike Broskis, probably hungover from the night before in the club gettin' tipsay."}
{"text":"It's not extraordinary but it's a good place to have brunch with friends. Food are good and you have many choices"}
{"text":"Aaah Cora ! Ses oeufs bénédictine, sa terrasse rue Sainte Catherine quand vient l'été, ses saveurs... Service parfois lent quand il y a du monde (surtout l'été justement) mais les assiettes sont copieuses et pleine de saveurs.

Retenez les oeufs bénédictine avec au choix : asperges, champignons ou brie, surtout si vous n'avez pas peur de \"l'attaque au gras\".

I really like Cora and his Benedictine eggs. and the terrasse on St Catherine while Summer is coming. Sometimes you have to wait for a seat when it's full (summer) but this place is good enough particularly if you are not scared about \"fat attack\" !"}
{"text":"Chez Cora, despite being a franchise/chain, does have well made, filling meals. And the food really is good. 

On arrival, the first thing you will probably notice is the enlarged picture of Cora (I assume?) on the front page of the menu - a touch I found to be a bit awkward..

Nevertheless, the menu is pretty extensive with a large number of options: sandwiches, burgers, omelettes, eggs Benedict, fried eggs, crepes, waffles, and a small 'rebellious' menu with unusual items like the breakfast poutine. 

There were four of us at the table and we ordered the (1) breakfast poutine, a ham & (2) swiss omelette, (3) eggs Benedict on waffles and (4) the breakfast burrito (in order of our preference, (1) being the best). 

The breakfast poutine was an egg atop roasted potatoes, frankfurters and bacon. It was definitely a risk to order, but I wasn't let down. It wasn't your typical poutine, not as greasy, and definitely had the nice breakfast touch I was looking for. The best part was it was topped with Hollandaise sauce rather than gravy. The ham and swiss omelette was also tasty and had a very generous amount of cheese which is always good, not to mention roasted potatoes and fruit. The eggs Benedict were good, but perhaps ordering them on a waffle wasn't the best idea. It was a slightly weird mix of salty and sweet, but it felt kinda like an acquired taste - the more you eat it, the better it gets. The breakfast burrito was actually pretty tasty as well - I didn't try much of it but my friend who ordered it really enjoyed it. The good thing is coffee is complimentary with the food! That's always good to know. 

The service was good, we received our food fairly quickly. There weren't many people when we went (around 13:30). 

Overall, the food definitely was as good as we could except. It wasn't exceptional, but worth going back for."}
{"text":"I'd like to begin this review by saying that if you come here on a weekend before noon, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes to be seated. Mind you, there was a Habs game when I came here, and the Bell Centre is just down the street. The restaurant is very cute. I've been for breakfast a couple of times and it always seems to be crowded. 

Their menu is huge, and a lot of meals come with a free coffee. The food was also good. The rest of my party loved their meals as well. My only complaint is that the waitress forgot to get us water, so I asked for some. She then brought one glass for me, but not the rest of the table. When we asked her for a few more glasses for everyone, she looked extremely annoyed. From that point on, she stopped checking on us, re-filling our coffees, etc. I understand that it was busy, but she was extremely unprofessional. 

Overall, the food was great, but one star off because of the service."}
{"text":"Bon rapport qualité prix. Brunch classique oeuf bacon patates pancake omellette etc avec choix variés. Service rapide."}
{"text":"Cora's might be the same across the board but loved the service at this one.

And God knows good service in Montreal is NOT a given. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Service correct, bonne place et bonne quantité dans les assiettes. Les smoothies n'avaient pas le goût des fruits frais et ils nous ont paru très froid, peut être à la limite du congelé. Les oeufs pochés avaient un fort gout de vinaigre."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. 

This place is breakfast heaven. I cannot believe I didn't know this place existed before this visit to Montreal. 

Each plate is a fruit masterpiece. If you hate fruit-- it would be best to request none on your plate because your dish will be loaded with them! Amazing! I had a bagel with smoked salmon, capers, onions, cream cheese and tomatoes. I was really only expecting the bagel with the toppings and was pleasantly surprised when I received an enormous side of fresh fruit! 

This is right next to a Best Western and the Marriott is just about two blocks away. Easy walking. 

I love breakfast and this place totally made my day. :o)"}
{"text":"This is the place to start your day in Montreal! 

The menu is quite extensive and the portions are huge. I had the crepes du chocolattes et banannes and it was brought out on a platter! My husband enjoyed the French toast made with chocolate brioches which was yummy, but not overly sweet. I am also a fan of their fresh squeezed juice. 

The prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

I look forward to returning to Chez Cora on my next trip to Montreal."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast one day.  We had to wait a bit, as it seems to be quite a popular  place. We got seated and menus were given to us.  The waiter was nice and eager to serve.  As my super-healthy eating friends perused the menu, I suddenly heard them cry out in horror and disgust at something in the menu.  I felt this was a cry for the item I wanted to eat.
     After they settled down, they revealed it to me.  It was called an e'tage 10, and it had just about every form of pig one could ask for on a plate.  This thing had hot dog, bacon, ham, bologna, sausage, Cheese, vegetables and the kitchen sink was tossed in for good measure.
     My friends ordered various healthy  things, and it all arrived shortly after we ordered it.  The food was very very well presented.  Fruit was arranged as beautiful flowers, placed atop sundae-dishes filled with yogurt parfait.  My omelet was massive, and delicious.  Meat extravaganza danced in my mouth.  Meat mixed with eggs and vegetables and was washed down with hot coffee.  It was an amazing meal. 
     The food was great, the service was great, and the place was clean.  Whenever I find my way back to Montreal, I'll certainly come back here."}
{"text":"As has become a tradition before the St-Patrick's Day parade in Montreal, we came here for breakfast to coat our stomachs before imbibing. We got there at about 10:30 to ensure we had enough time to wait in line (because there will most definitely be a line on the morning of the St-Patrick's Day parade!), eat and get to our \"spot\" in time for the parade to start. We waited about 15 minutes in line which isn't bad considering the amount of people there. We were seated by the window (always a nice touch), and wanting to try something different from my usual (3 large crepes with fresh fruit and homestyle potatoes), I opted for Rosemary's Sunday, which included everything you could possibly want in a breakfast - eggs (scrambled of course), whole wheat toast, fresh fruit, blueberry pancakes, homestyle potatoes and bacon. YUM! It was very satisfying and pretty good, mind you the pancakes could have been a little fluffier and fresher (they seemed a little stale), but nonetheless, it was a success! For a chain restaurant it does the trick. Given a choice, however, I prefer smaller establishments."}
{"text":"Food's good but the service sucks, parking sucks and the food is mediocre. The place across the street, Eggs Frutti, is far better and kicking the business out of this place.

Chez Cora better step up its game if it plans on staying in business.

This place is so overrated, it's no longer enjoyable!"}
{"text":"It was good, but I feel like the menu was very limited. If you love fruit and bacon in the morning this is the place to be. I got the banana chocolate crepes and it wasn't bad but they put a crap load of bananas lol."}
{"text":"Ce n'est plus ce que c'était avant, mais c'est correct. La carte tarde à se renouveler, c'est dommage."}
