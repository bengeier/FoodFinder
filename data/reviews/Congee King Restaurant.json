{"text":"The food was tasty and well made, but took longer than expected to arrive on a night that was not very busy. Wait staff was pleasant and positive and accurate with the order.

Would go back again, no complaints :)"}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly and quick service, staff are very attentive! They can also communicate in both English and Cantonese.

The fried noodles and congee are tasty and come in generous portions, but the noodle soup tasted somewhat bland and lacking in flavour.

The Cantonese Chow Mein came with a lot and we were able to share with each other. We all ordered 1 dish each and ended up taking a majority of it home. The sizes of the dishes are great!

Overall, it was a yummy and filling meal. Would definitely come again. :)"}
{"text":"The chefs must know what I want when I walk in because the food arrives super speedy fast after ordering it. This is also true with large group of people. Consistent, always fresh, always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Staff are very friendly even though they don't speak fluent English food taste great and at a cheap price"}
{"text":"I love the congee . Definitely I go back again . Exellent customer service  Restaurant was clean ."}
{"text":"we recently went here ordered 3 dishes, the beef in enoki mushroom, garoupa pan fried and crispy chicken.  the overall taste was mediocre but especially disappointed in the crispy chicken...they gave us an unfresh chicken, the color no longer fresh and it was less than half a chicken considering the price of almost $10. I resent coming here because I had high expectation."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I come in here once a week with my daughter.  It's quiet when all the other dimsum joint in Scarborough are too packed (yes, they serve dimsum items).  I get the beef congee, the spicy pork chop, and the steamed rice rolls.  They serve it surprisingly fast (it's like they already knew what I wanted the moment I walked in), and the portions are great.  I always end up having to take some home.  The service is excellent.  Staff is nice."}
{"text":"I don't usually like to give bad reviews to restaurants, but I need to ensure people are warned before deciding to order the other food and drinks at this particular restaurant.

I usually go there and I order the Congee. Congee = Good choice that is when you go in the mornings or afternoons; there are days it's a hit and a miss. The Congee can be very watery. This again depends on ones preference. I prefer my Congee a bit thick and with lots of stuff. It's a definite comfort food. Congee gets a 2 thumbs up. :)

The problem isn't the Congee (their name is Congee King)...In fact, I go back because of the Congee and it being close to my home...  the problem lines in their other foods. I understand if you haven't had real Chinese food their quality may meet your expectations, but it definitely isn't the best I've tried. The following are some of the experiences I had with their other foods. 

One day I thought I give their Shanghai Chow Mei a try... the price was about $7-8... 
I thought I'm sure they'll be good. Bad idea... It was horrid. The noodles were not cooked right; they were tough to chew on and at first I didn't want to bother the waitress about it. Seriously, for the price I'm paying I expect to have at least a well cooked noodle. So I explained to the waitress my issue with the noodle and they asked what's wrong with it.  I lightly informed them to add a bit more water to it as the noodles were not completely defrost. They tried and also agreed that it was too hard, so they took it back in and tried to cook it. Sadly, they were unable to fix it. I had confronted them already and felt bad not to say too much and just packed the rest for home. I had to later bring it home and cook it myself.  Noodles gets two thumbs down. :(

Another time I went, I wanted to try something different... See how loyal I am to this restaurant... Unfortunately, the dim sum is also a no go! Do not order their dim sum... it's so from the frozen packs, not fresh at all. Again, this is from someone who had authentic dim sum from Hong Kong and China; so if you don't have such strong taste buds, maybe it would be fine for you. Then again, would you rather go to a dim sum restaurant to eat dim sum or a Congee place? Dim Sum gets 1 thumb down. 

So as a usual customer of their Congee, I returned for some comfort congee.This time I thought, I try their red bean crushed ice with ice cream drink... The first time I had it, the taste was okay, and my boyfriend also agreed it was nice because he never really like red bean. So at this point we were happy...

Tonight, after dinner, we had a craving for it and decided to just go for the red bean drink at the Congee place. Super bad idea! And this is especially at night, the waitress had a long day and the night has just began for some. When our drinks arrived, I was hoping that it would taste the same as last time. I was wrong.

I sipped once, the red bean was bland.  I thought maybe I didn't taste it right, or maybe my taste buds were whacked. So I drank some tea to rinse my palate. Again, I sipped it and there was no taste; in fact the red bean seemed a bit rough. Then I tried mixing the ice cream thinking the sweetness will soak in, but that didn't work either. 

Then I realized the red bean wasn't cooked with enough sugar and not enough crushed ice; the one ingredient that makes this drink awesome was absent - condensed milk. It was all watered down and had no taste, except for the ice cream. My boyfriend also agreed that this drink was bland and wasn't the same as we had last time. As you see, I didn't want to bug the waitress, but I thought maybe she could help us out. At first she was being nice and asking all sorts of questions to try to fix the drink. In the end she just added tons of sugar syrup. I even saw her try our drinks at the back. She tried to ignore me when I just wanted to pay... Enough said, I came home and had a party in my stomach. This is me after I analyzed all the food I had today and came to the conclusion that my stomach had something to do with this restaurant. I don't want to put all the blame but some part of the mixing has a big part in the painful stomach ache which I am still experiencing as I'm am composing this review. 

To sum,  the Congee is fine, but beware of the other foods that they serve there. 
If you ask me if I would go back, I would for the Congee, never again for the other foods on their menu. I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"We tried this place as one of the options for a nearby Congee place and I must say this is the worst experience for a restaurant in Toronto area. I have never written a review before even though i rely heavily on reviews before trying out a new place. The service from the start was not up to the mark. We were seated for 10 minutes and the staff forgot to take down the order.There were only three tables occupied when we were seated. The chef too was seated on a table next to us having his meal, but when we called for the waiter a couple of times to place our order, he did not try to help us by getting the staff attention. 

The food was not upto the mark and I had to remove the ginger peices as they were raw. The pork meat too was smelly. At the end, we had to once again call for the check and again, there was a wait period. Apparently the staff was interested in some Chinese TV awards and all the staff was more inclined to not missing it. I certainly do not recommend this place as the service, ambiance, and food have a bad rating from my end."}
{"text":"Food: 3.25 stars
Service: 4 stars
Value: 3.25 stars

There are so many different congee restaurants in Toronto. Congee King is an older style Chinese restaurant with an out-dated interior decor. However, the food here wasn't too bad. I was surprised to find out the Chau-Chow style oyster congee was pretty authentic and tasty. And the steamed plain rice noodle roll was very smooth and soft too. The rest of the food was just ordinary. The deep-fried sweet cruller was not crispy and fluffy enough. But the lady who served us was nice and polite though."}
{"text":"I frequent this place at least once every two months for congee.  For the unfamiliar, congee is like Chinese comfort food.  It's a thick bowl of rice porridge cooked until the rice is mush and barely recognizable, with meat and veggies thrown in.  

Their congee is quite good.  It's always seasoned well, and they don't skimp on ingredients.  I get either the scallop or fish congee, and it comes loaded with seafood.  Their salty donut sticks (for dipping into the congee) are always hot and fresh.  Their food dishes are also good.  I've had their fried noodles, stir fries, spicy radish cake, and fried seafood.  It's all tasty.  

The restaurant itself is slightly run-down, but the staff keep it clean.  Service is available in English, Mandarin and Cantonese.  All in all, good for a quick Chinese food fix."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience in this congee restaurant. Their server was an older man who had a tooth pick (actually picking his teeth) in his mouth the whole time. My biggest concern was if anything from his mouth or tooth pick could've gone into our congee! Another customer next to us was coughing erratically so it was just a gross experience for me and my family. When it comes to cleanliness this is not the best place to go for congee. I suggest going uptown instead."}
{"text":"First off I found the AC a little strong for my jeans and t-shirt OTD so if you're coming around September bring a sweater!

Anyway. First time trying a noodle bowl that's  not Pho cause the Pho spot next door closed down! 

We got the Congee King Noodle Supreme. It was jam packed with meat! We shared a large bowl that we shared between the 2 of us plus 1 order of suimai dim sum and it was more than enough!  The broth was just right. I like adding the spicy oil and red vinegar to the soup. I wouldn't but the suimai again thought since I've had better. 

I've been here before and really they're known for their congee. So if you end up here just go for their specialty!"}
{"text":"Always a favorite haunt when visiting TO. Whether it's Congee King, Queen... Even their sides like XO Turnip cake are can't misses!"}
{"text":"Good chinese food on a consistent basis, I love the Congee King/Queen's, My personal favourite is the Congee Queen on Steeles (the one on Hwy7 isn't as good), and Congee King in Scarborough is second, they are also much cheaper then the Queen variety...can't go wrong with this place when your in the borough!"}
{"text":"This has become one of my must-go places when I visit Toronto. They serve congee, noodles, noodle soup, and dim-sum all day. They are open for breakfast and they stay open late. The portions are big. The lean pork with preserved egg congee was excellent. I also really liked the BBQ pork rice roll. This restaurant has really good food without the wait and the crowds of the well-known places."}
{"text":"Lots of msg in the food, service was extremely slow on a very quiet day. 
Half the food came out after 1/2 hour, and waited another half for another two dishes. 
Would not come back here!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I ever written a review about a food place, so I can assure you I had a horrible experience here. If first started off with me calling them and asking about delivery seeing they got pretty high scores here at urbanspoon.
A women answered the phone and advised me that orders over 30 dollars before delivery. So as I finished up my order coming to 50 dollars, she then tells me theres a gas fee of 4 dollars. Immediately I told her that i would pick up instead. Upon arriving the store, the menu out front says, \"FREE DELIVERY AFTER $30.\" So what is this gas charge she told me about?
I simply ignore it and pay for what I ordered on the phone to pick up. Upon arriving with practically no one in the restaurant I wait ANOTHER 30 minutes for my food on top of the time it took for me to drive there. Once I receive my food, I noticed they short changed me on A LOT of sauce for a 20 dollar dish I ordered.
One of the dish is called yin yang fried rice that contains white sauce and red sauce, however i told them to substitute the white for another red so, 2x red sauce. Well when I got home, opened the container, ( the small ones ), its not even half full, for each container. In fact when I combined both red sauce together it made 1 red sauce. so they short changed me there.
When the food finally was placed in our mouths. Thats when everything went bad. Either the food is EXTREMELY salty or the food is EXTREMELY tasteless. This is the first place I have ever written about food and I can assure you theres a reason why they are empty near rush hour times.
Dont waste your time and money here, go some where else. Their dishes arent cheap either at roughly 10 dollars + a dish. They might have been good at one point, but moving forward, horrendous service, shaddy practice and disgusting food"}
{"text":"Great place, big portion of food and congee!   Lots of meat in the congee. Friendly service, serve food fast. Really Worth it!"}
{"text":"Great thing about this place was its opening available and as a late night option. The price for a hole in a wall type place is average to a bit steeper than the norm. I would return for late night but nothing really stood out. We didn't really like the sweet and sour chicken as the pcs of chicken was very unevenly cooked....some over cooked to overly dry. The portion of the steam rolls were impressively huge however a bit soggy. The fried intestines were a but on the dry leathery side. The pork chop lo mien were passable but underwhelming. Overall the meal was average and unmemorable."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times in the past. It's your typical Cantonese congee/noodle place. Decent quality and portions. Reasonable prices. When my wife cooks congee at home I usually come to this place for fried dough fritters, both the regular and sweet ones are good."}
{"text":"Tasted like the takeout food from Chinese groceries like T&T or Foody Scarborough. If you are starving then this will do. If not then suggest you go elsewhere if you are in search of authentic Chinese cuisine that will wow your palate. I was here during my pre-Yelp days so don't have pictures for it. Prices are reasonable.

I mention Foody Scarborough specifically because the Foody Markham's cooked food for takeout is not better than Congee King."}
{"text":"Came here in a rush and had a decent lunch. I ordered some preserved egg and pork congee, eggplant clay pot, and seafood chow mein. I was happy with the congee and especially satisfied with the eggplant clay pot. The chow mein was super disappointing as it was very plain. The small congee was actually pretty big and can serve full bowls to five people. Now, the eggplant was super delicious. I normally HATE eggplant but this was soooo good. The sauce is what made it awesome, it was sweet and abit salty, giving it a nice savory flavor (and minced pork). 

The prices are average though ($40 in total for 3 people including tip). I could easily find another restaurant abit cheaper for the same portions and equal or better tasting food. I'll come back if I happen to drive by and feeling for congee and that eggplant!"}
{"text":"I've come here twice so far.  Once for take out and once to eat in. Cheap tasty Chinese food. They got beef ho fun noodle soup that's tasty and costs less than 5. Their shredded pork and golden preserved egg congee for less than 5 as well was really good. Small place and not the best ambiance. Just a standard Chinese restaurant but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"In general, this is a good place for congee, stir fry noodles, and soup noodles.  There were two dishes that I tried which weren't good at all though... 1) salty doughnut stick wrapped in rice noodle ():  the doughnut was soggy soft, so the contrast between the crispy donut and the smooth rice noodle wrap was non-existent.  2) deep-fried tofu in sauce ():  the deep frying was pretty good with a crispy outside and soft inside, though one piece was slightly burnt on the outside.  The problem is the sauce, they put dark soy sauce all over the dish instead of the stewing sauce.  It absolutely destroyed the dish."}
{"text":"It is true that only the congee is good. The other food is a bit below average. The fried dough was great too, but the wait was extremely long since they were catering for a school. It was holding up our food. The congee did come fast though  It was a good 25-30 minutes before the food came. At least we had wifi while we were waiting."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Congee King during the first heavy snow/rain fall of the year.  We chose it because, out of the 3 restaurants in this strip mall, this was the only one that had patrons.  We ordered a Salty Fish and Tofu Hot Pot and a Beef and Vegetable Stir Fry Flat Noodle.  Boy, both of them smelled really good.  The noodle tasted better than the hot pot, but the credit went to how exceptionally well made and delicious the noodle was.  It had lot of beef slices and vegetable, and the sauce was thick and bold.  It fared well against big and expensive restaurants.  I recommend it.  The hot pot tasted okay.  The tofu was fresh and soft, but I could not find the salty fish bits, even I could smell and taste it in the sauce.  

Services was typical of Chinese noodle/congee places: effective, fast yet lurkwarm."}
{"text":"Got the wonton noodle. Wish I read Jennifer K's review before ordering. It was just like she said already. Wontons were definately not fresh. It tasted like it came from a frozen package. Rubbery is a good way to desribe it. The wontons were also very small in size.

There were so many different things on the menu I found it hard to choose so I just went with something simple. 

The one time I don't read JK's review and this is what happens. Never again will I make that mistake."}
{"text":"Not really anything special.

Asked a waitress if there was MSG in the food, she left to check and we never got a reply."}
{"text":"Another weekend, another congee place for breakfast.  If I could only use 1 word to describe this place, it would be average.  Nothing great, but nothing horrible too.

Pros:
Extensive menu
Prices are pretty good

Cons:
Food could be much better

First thing I notice when I come in is the place is much bigger than it seems from the outside.  There's a lot of tables and booths so even when busy, it shouldn't take too long to get a seat.  Opening the menu, we find it to be very extensive.  They have a lot of options here.  There's about 25-30 selections of congee which is more than adequate.  

I order the fish and beef congee, my GF gets the garoupa congee.  We also order a fried dough fritter for the congee and a sticky rice for our little one.  The congee comes out pretty fast.  It's decent, but not anything special.  It's a little on the bland side but you can easily correct that with some salt.  The dough fritter was pretty good.  It was crispy and you get a good amount for the price.  The sticky rice was disappointing.  It came out last and wasn't too well done.  Parts of it were too chewy, which is a sign it's not cooked enough.  It was still OK, but could of been better.

The prices are pretty good when comparing against other congee places.  Our total came out to just under $20. The service is typical to what you expect.  It was there, but again. not anything to write home about.  

Congee King is the definition of average.  You get what you expect from here.  It won't be anything special but you won't go home disappointed either."}
{"text":"I go here when I'm feeling like eating a small meal but with dim sum on the side, without having to do the whole morning yam cha(?) thing.

It's a shame that I don't really like congee because that's what most people definitely get but I usually just stick with side orders, fried squid tentacles, beef brisket, fried pork chops, shrimp dumplings etc.

Aside from the great dim sum sides, their fried items are especially tasty because they have a great fry seasoning. It's so good that sometimes we just flat out get dough fritters even though we don't have then with congee."}
{"text":"I really like this place, I always come here for late night food since they're usually open pretty late. I've never ordered a dish here and felt it tasted bad.

Their sweet and sour pork chop is so good, and their a choy and beef is my favorite too! Their congee and noodle dishes and even dim sum items are good. 

Also, the waitresses are very friendly. Once I forgot my keys there after they closed and they helped me leave it in their mailbox wrapped in a baggy for me to pick up. 

I guess my only bad thing is that their halo halo drink isn't good at all. Lol it's the most expensive drink on their menu and I couldn't bring myself to drink half of it :c"}
{"text":"I came back here today as it was literally the only joint in the area that was opened before 11AM.  
I checked my review last time and I didn't seem to hate it so I thought I'd come back to honestly stop my hunger pains.

I walked in and it was empty.  The manager/server was at the cash and seated me, took my order, and came back 15 minutes later with my congee and siu mai.

First, the place smells like ammonia and it spreads over the taste of your food.
Secondly, I have never known a Chinese restaurant to take so long in making food - especially when the restaurant was literally empty.
Thirdly, I hated the food.  The congee had huge pieces of ginger, the preserved egg was nasty, and the beef was deteriorating. I honestly ate the top layer of the congee and did not want the rest.  The siu mai was the simple pork, shrimp, and mushrooms - however, it was so oily that I didn't want to eat anymore after 2. 

I 100% will not visit again. I hate wasting food and when I do it, it's a sign that this place is not the place for me."}
{"text":"Congee king is our usual congee restaurant to go to when we have a sore throat, lacking appetite, or feeling a little sick.

They've been around for business for as long as I can remember.

My review is based on their congee, not other food they carry - because well.. I only come here for congee!

Their congee has always been very delicious and comforting. Unlike other places, their congee is not super watery or MSG filled.

And the best part is they don't cheap out on the meat.

Our usual order:  fish sliced congee with fried dough stick & lean pork with preserved egg congee

Their other dishes may or may not be good but their congee is definitely one of the better ones around here.

While you're here, try their Spanish coffee!"}
{"text":"This is mediocre congee, but it's great for a snowy cloudy day. We got congee to go. We ordered one with shark fin and other one with thousand year egg. Both were good, but you could barely find the shark fin or fermented egg in either of the congee. It's about $5 for nice size container congee."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been back here. The congee is so yummy here and the portion is huge for only $5. I did also have the beef rice crepe, which I found the crepe to be too thick and the soy sauce bland. I wouldn't get dim sum here. I also had the beef and egg sauce over fried rice noodles. This was starchy goodness. It was good, but it didn't have the crispiness on the bottom of the dish that I enjoyed so much at another restaurant in Toronto. When I'm in this area, this is my go-to for some old fashioned comfort food."}
{"text":"2.5 star

Congee King Restaurant is a good place if you want to have some Cantonese comfort food. 

My review is a little bias in a way that I only order a Wonton/Dumpling Noodle Soup ($5.49)

The Good
- Free unsecured WIFI
- TVs showing Chinese TV show, I won't miss my soap opera
- Services is friendly 
- Accepts all credit cards including AMEX

The Bad
- The shrimp in the dumplings were not fresh, tasted rubbery
- The brownish broth was so salty!! So much MSG I was so thirsty for the whole evening......

Will I come back? Maybe I give the congee a try.. since it is really call Congee King not Wonton King?"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice: once a long time ago and the other time a few months ago. When I came here a few months ago, there were no other customers other than my friend and I. That should have been my first warning. 

We both ordered different noodle soups. The broth was extremely salty, and the balance of noodle to meat to soup ratio wasn't the greatest as it looked like everything was just floating in a huge bowl of soup. Price wise, it was cheap, so maybe I'm just getting what I paid for. 

Service is average. They have free wifi."}
{"text":"This is good quality food for some good pricing. My sister was on a hunt for thicker noodles, and she finally found them here - the Shanghai style noodles. I on the other hand was looking for Cantonese style noodles and I was not disappointed by it. The food is what you expect from Chinese food (so many options for noodles!). There weren't any exceptionally bad plates, and theres a vareity of food to please everyone. The downside to this restaurant is it is cash or debit only, so you are S.O.L. if you have a large party like we did! The waitresses also aren't the most helpful people and seemed to not have straws (or did not want ro give us). We also had Christmas carolers come in and sing to us for a donation to their church which was a funny experience."}
{"text":"This place has been a family favourite as well and was the best place for congee before Congee Queen came into town. The congee is fresh with lots of ingredients and cooked to the right amount of time. The rice noodle with fried \"yau ja gway\" is also very fresh and on par with other congee places, if not better. Their big noodle soup with wontons is very generous portions and delicious as well. Ambience-wise, very busy but the service is not bad. It is a bit cramped, but a good place for a lunch or dinner."}
