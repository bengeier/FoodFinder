{"text":"fast food style, last time I ate here I got sick, I throw out. taste is bad, for fast food the price is not cheat. Even my French teacher ate here told me here is not good, even bad. I should not try!!! I don't know why so many people rate here is good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed Thali for exactly what it is - good, fast and affordable Indian cuisine. It's not an impressive restaurant but the selection is quite good and you simply can't beat the amount of food you get for the price. The meat Thali (2 meat dishes, 1 veg dish, rice, salad & naan) is really good - enough food for two meals for me. And at t $9, it's a perfect way to get a big selection of food at a small price.

I would, however, prefer that they use boneless meats in their dishes but I wasn't surprised that they didn't - that is usually  big factor in the pricing of Indian dishes. 

They also have a great selection of appetizers at $1 - $3 a pop.. I will definitely stop by for a good snack in the near future.

All in all, a great find in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Montreal, hands down! Been eating here once or twice a week for 7-8 years and can't imagine the neighbourhood without this place. Very good flavour. Some days spicier than others depending on the cook's mood. I usually get the non-veg thali with butter chicken, the chicken curry and the palak paneer. Comes with a huge doughy naan to soak up the delicious sauces. The meat samosas are delicious too! Can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I love indian food and I am used to eat a lot of it. Thali is very small and usually packed so most of the time, I call in to order and go pick up my food.
I've tried almost everything but I stick to the butter chicken as it is my favourite East-Indian dish. 
Naan bread is usually not that warm which sucks because it would taste better if it was served very hot.
Be careful, 80% of their food is very spicy!
+++: they sell Thumbs Up :)."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since I live right nearby. When I walked in, it wasn't packed and it wasn't fully clear whether you order at the cash first or at the food counter. FYI you pay first and then receive your food.

I chose a thali mix of lamb curry, butter chicken, and Chana Masala. The butter chicken was kind of bland so I have definitely had better considering this is a staple in most places. The rest was very good. I really enjoy the amount of food they give you for the money. Another thing I tried was the meat and vege samosas. I am a pretty big meat eater, but the vegetarian samosa is the better of the two. Very tasty!

The place does have a quick cafeteria/cafe feel. This means that you don't get the full sit down restaurant feel, but it does allow you to get your food as fast as possible. Great for takeout!"}
{"text":"The combination plate comes with three curries (2 meat and 1 vegetable), rice, naan, and a 'salad' (some lettuce) is a great value for the price. The chicken curry was good and the beef was dry. I also tried their onion bhajis.

The Good: Price and Speed. Naan and a papadum were included 

The Bad: The beef was dry. The onion bhajis were dry and tasted old. The divided plate was more awkward and messy than a regular plate."}
{"text":"The Best Indian food I had in Montreal. The restaurant customers are mostly students, so don't expect to have nice decor and ample space. However, food is cheap and authentic. 

For $9, you will have a non-veg dish with a choice of two non-veg and one veg serving, plus rice and a naan. 

Food is really tasty and spicy, just the way I like it!  Mango lassis are really good here too!

One thing though, my 3 year-old son did not eat anything except for the butter chicken, rice and naan. Everything else was too spicy for him."}
{"text":"Good cheap indian food downtown! The food isn't four star quality, but you can't beat a non-vegetarian thali for $9 tax included! Lamb curry and butter chicken are pretty good. Generous portions. I've had lunch at this place three days in a row now."}
{"text":"I had a great meal there - friendly, quick service and really good food that doesn't skimp on the spice.  For the area, it's a great value - especially the non-vegetarian thali, which is excellent.  There are, of course, cheaper and better places in Montreal, up in little India (near Jean-Talon - I'm thinking of Bombay Mahal and Maison Indian Curry) but in the downtown and downtown-proximate area, this is the closest I've found.  Definitely a go-to place when you've got a craving for good Indian food."}
{"text":"This is a great small place and really unbeatable prices if you like to try a bit of everything. As other posters here have mentioned, they have a vegetarian thali and meat thali for around $ 9.00 and you get either all vegetarian choices or 2 meat + 1 vegetarian option. Comes with Naan/rice/papadam bread. 

I love their butter chicken and chicken curry but the last few times it was a bit lacking in flavour. I think it's just not as consistent, but that being said, I am rarely disappointed. Great place for take out and if you aren't looking for a thali special, their menu actually has some great options as well. I love their chana samosa!"}
{"text":"Thali is what I would call \"extreme casual eating\". The $9 plate is a heck of a lot of food - so much so that the plate is more like a metal platter, with generous dollops of curries, rice, naan, and vegetables. The food was fresh, varied, and leaving your fork with a constant decision of what to scoop next.

\"Extreme\" also reflects the dining. Tables are setup like a coffee shop. You order yourself, pick up the food yourself, and clean out your plate at the end. A surprise, since from the street it looks like more a typical waited-table restaurant, but also highly ideal for anybody who needs to eat-and-go without the usual tips and tables fluff.

Listing downsides under such extreme eating conditions comes off a bit hollow, but should be mentioned anyway. They seem understaffed - I felt more like I was eating at a Singapore stall than an enclosed restaurant, and getting water was not exactly intuitive. The money saved on the main dish is easily swallowed if you want to order any of the side items - Lassi, Bhaji, etc - which turned out to be a bit expensive.

I don't think Thali is revolutionary eating. If you've already made your mind up on Indian cuisine this is unlikely to change your mind. But if if you want a lot of food, fast - say it's office lunch hour - Thali should be an obvious target."}
{"text":"Good Indian take out. Quick service and not expensive.  The only issue is that it's a bit small to sit and always full. You will have to sit  elbow to elbow with strangers,  take out is the best option."}
{"text":"Best indian food in town.

Their butter chicken is the best I've ever had. All their veggie sides are good, too. I order from them a lot and the food always arrived in less than 25 minutes.

Only thing to improve would be to include more papadam. I always pay for 2-3 extra papadams but almost always get only one. 

Go there though, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I came here once and don't think I'll be going back. The food was passable, and the service was commensurate to the price. However, there was something that I did not like about its business concept:

According to the menu, a combination plate (a thali) gives you 2 meat choices and 1 vegetable choice. Two meat choices can be anything that's available like \"butter chicken\" or \"lamb curry\", etc. The issue I have with this restaurant is that, according to the waiter, you cannot chose the same meat twice. For example, I love butter chicken and I don't care for the other meats. However, I cannot chose butter chicken twice as my two meats. I have to chose something else. Why?

Is it something so hard to do? Will it cause the business to go in financial ruins if I choose \"butter chicken\" twice instead of for example \"butter chicken + lamb curry\"? In any case, on my last visit, I was forced to choose \"butter chicken + lamb curry\" instead of \"butter chicken + butter chicken\"...

But I guess this incidence was a blessing in disguise anyways as the butter chicken wasn't even that good."}
{"text":"Thali Cuisine Indienne is a cozy family run restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and isn't on a trendy street, but the interior is quite nice, the service was good and friendly, the food was excellent and very inexpensive for the quality. We paid about $12 each for Thali for dinner. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"10$ for a non-veg (meat) thali combo which include the naan bread, I think it's one of the best deal you can get at this price point. I love their butter chicken, lamp curry and others masala. They got also tika chicken. 
The couple of things changed over the years, now they make the naan bread way in advance and try to keep it warm in a container so sometimes you can get cold/slight warm naan and the thali combos used to come with a small Salad on the rice."}
{"text":"It's a small joint, busy joint!  I went we a friend. ...she likes the place. .so i gave it a shot. I have definitely had better food! I had mango lassi which i liked. . My friend had a masala/ salty lassi . We both got thalis. I got chilli chicken...it had gravy....but still tasted good. .except the curry was pretty runny and i had lamb curry as well ...i really like lamb. But i have had much much better lamb than this place. The lamb was hard. So the nonveg thali combo is you get  2 non veg curries and 1 veg...for veg i wanted to have paneer...they had 2 paneer dishes. ..1 sag paneer in which i could not see paneer and the other one was matar paneer...i missed the whole dish all together ..just dint see it until later. So anyways. .i went with aloo baigan...which was pretty good but mild for my taste. All the food i had here was mild.  The rice wasOK and naan couldbe softer but was still OK. The thing i least liked about this place was their presentation of food.  The least you could do is not let curry run all over the plate that it looks so messy and drippy that you don't feel like you are eating at that restraunt. You gotta be very careful with all that runny food. I mean the quantity is good but i don't waana be worrying about the curry spilling all over me given the chances are high in that jam packed place. The arrangement of tables was not good either. .. me and my friend sat side by side cause if we had to sit facing each other a person would have had to get up everytime we needed something and wanted to get out. That entire row was blocked just cause that person sat at the opening end. It'snot his fault isthe arrangement  that needs bettermenr. The arrangement is very casual so we could make it work for us but this place would do better having their staff serve than self service and better seating arrangements. All in all..OK good. ..good staff..good lassi..i don't think i waana go there again except for the lassi perhaps..Or may be to try other stuff on the menu not the thali though. They do have some variety here, also sweets. Those might be interesting to try."}
{"text":"Less expensive and student friendly...
Worth the price..All vegetarian dishes,starters and meat tastes yum.but the chicken i taste didn't taste fresh..(we have bought 5 to 6 times. Everytime, the chicken seemed to taste odd)."}
{"text":"Simply the best. This has been my go-to Indian restaurant since I moved to Montreal. The staff is so friendly and helpful, and the food is just insanely good for the price. My normal order is a non-vegetarian Thali and a mango lassi, and I've really never gotten anything bad on my plate. The butter chicken is good, but my personal favorite would be the beef curry.
I've also had a great experience with the fried snacks they offer- chicken pakoras are the best I've ever tasted, and I love their samosas, alu bonda and bhajis too. Delicious barfi ($1 each and worth ten times as much in my opinion) and kulfi for dessert. 
If I had one complaint, it would be that the dining room is very very crowded and busy- the result of their amazing food and service. As such, I normally take my order to go. Cannot recommend Thali highly enough."}
{"text":"I ordered the tandoori chicken with naan and rice while my friend ordered the palak paneer.

The chicken was really dry but if you can look past that, the flavours were great. My friend loved the palak paneer but couldn't finish it because it was another level of spicy. The naan was a little different from what I group up with from my friends' parents' cooking (there was a large indo-Canadian population where I grew up); it was kinda fluffy and tasted like pancakes-- not necessarily a bad thing but definitely not what I was looking for. 

The service was top-notch. The girl at the cash was super friendly and so were the guys in the back. 

I'd probably still come back."}
{"text":"The girl who served food there when I went had the worst attitude I had ever seen. She made the entire experience very very shitty, gave me dirty and impatient looks while I waited with the other customers as my food took the longest, as though it was my fault. She also spilled sauce over my tray and it dripped onto my bag and forearm. Everyone was given a side salad except for me. When I asked her about it, she did not acknowledge it. She talked to her boss and her boss told her to give me extra sauce and rice. She still did not acknowledge me and just waited. So I had to ask, can I have sauce? She, armed with an impatient look, then drowned every grain of my rice in sauce to make some kind of porridge curry, which does not taste good. So I asked for extra rice, which I was entitled to. She glared at me before giving me the extra rice. And the cherry on top of this terrific experience is the chicken that was raw near the center. 

Overall shitty experience, fire that girl waitress and it'll be heaps better."}
{"text":"I don't know if we are talking about the same restaurant as the other reviewers because the Thali I went to on rue st. Marc was quite simply plain. The chicken was previously frozen from it's texture, the chutney was the most liquid I ever had and the samosa were as they say in French \"fade\". The friendliness of the staff is the same as I would imaging at a prison cafeteria. The only successful thing was the nunn bread. I will not be returning to this place and am bummed I got talked into trying Indian cuisine in Montreal. Lost a perfect occasion to try something special."}
{"text":"I was near Concordia University. Didn't know what to eat and felt like trying new stuff. I always passed by this Indian restaurant and we gave it a try. 
Awesome experience. 
I didn't know what to order. Proactive staff suggested me the combo meal option: Choose 2 meats and veggies, comes with white rice, naan and crispy flake (DAM GOOD LOL) 
I chose the Lamb option oohoh (Fabulous, so tasty, shoutout to lamb lover)
and butter chicken (good stuff) and some potatoes
I thought that it wouldn't fill me up, but NOPE. Good for your money, quality food haha. 
I'll definitely come back for a lamb wrap and try the other meat options ;') 
Keep the good job!"}
{"text":"Thali = Value for Money

Plus

$9 for a Non-Veg thali is a steal deal - an assortment of meats and vegetarian accompanied with Indian bread and rice.

Veg thali goes for $8

Dessert is not bad either

Service is quick (esp. for take outs)

Not so Plus

I think the one \"don't have it\" dish here is the biryani - it was terrible - tasted like spicy rice with shredded chicken in it. Seriously!!
I don't like it when someone messes with a Biryani..:p
I could be very critical when it comes to Indian food - to me this place is A-OK. I have had better butter chicken's and biryanis and both of them here are not up to my standards.

I've found another place that serves a decent biryani - but will blah about it in my next review

Price is tax included
Decor - nothing to mention
Service - passable
No Wifi"}
{"text":"Really good food for the price i've been going to this place for years and still love it the wraps are super good and my favourites items are the butter chicken, cheese spinach, and lamb curry."}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of this place. It's cheap, it seems homemade and overall I like that its laid back and doesn't seem dolled up.
I had the butter chicken which I found delicious, but I am not a butter chicken connoisseur and I am not sure it would stand up to other ones. The lamb curry wasn't great, the flavor was passable but the meat was chewy. The cauliflower and potato was good.
The naan bread was the best part. very delicious.
We were sitting right at the front window and the down turn happened when I noticed a dead fly squished between the paper signs taped up on the wall. When I went to the bathroom the wall in the hallway was dirty and the light switch was filthy.
It seems really nit-picky, but, these are all things that could EASILY be improved upon, if they just took a little time to clean the place. It doesn't need to be fancy, but basic cleanliness would be nice!"}
{"text":"Want to like this place as the value is amazing. 3 choice Thali's for like 10$ tax included! Problem is I cant stand the spices they use. Always find myself forcing it down. Seems very popular though amongst students. Maybe Im just too picky?  Regardless Im not a fan.."}
{"text":"The food was okay once I was able to eat it.  Ordered delivery to my hotel room. It came without any plates or eating utensils.  Really????  Had to hunt and forage for a plastic spoon. All in all not my best take out experience."}
{"text":"I lived in India almost one year. And I can tell you, that the food here tastes the same as real Indian food. I was feeling that I eat in my favorite place in Panaji. Samosa are very tasty. Try dal - it is super tasty."}
{"text":"Solid, affordable Indian food. Enjoyed the butter chicken and chili chicken."}
{"text":"My brother loves this place and he took me for the first time last week. He says the food is great and so are the prices. It's in the heart of students and just off St. Catherine and Saint Marc. It's very hot inside so make sure to dress appropriately if you are staying to eat. It's quite small and most people take-out. There are tables for about 15 customers. 

I was not impressed with my order at all. I got the chicken wrap with cauliflower on the side. The wrap was impossible to eat since it was extremely hard as if it was overcooked. I did not know what to expect, so I tried my best to bite into it. In the end I ate the fillings and left the outside. The cauliflower was good, but nothing special. 

My brother's dish looked much better, he got the non-vegetarian meat dish with naan bread and a veggie dish which he finished.  

It won't be my go-to place if I'm craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. I came here with two friends and we ordered one vegetarian platter and one meat platter and had way more than enough food to share. At $10 a platter, you certainly can't beat the price for the amount of food you receive. The food was flavorful and the naan was amazing- very fresh and fluffy."}
{"text":"Great little cozy place, very homey . Food is great and fresh. Delicious selection, love the Thali plate and the chicken sandwich made with naan bread. Real comfort food feel and very generous plates, you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"It's good for what it is. It's a very tasty, very inexpensive, tiny cafeteria-ish place. Don't expect luxury, just very good food."}
{"text":"A taste of India even the PQ can't hate!!!!
Great quality, great service, even better price point. 
for 9 dollars you get 2 meat choices and a vege choice plus rice and salad and nann bread.  Also they have great vegetarian only selections.

The choices i like are butter chicken, chicken curry, chana masala (aka awesome chick peas) 

If your looking for a great treat on a cold winter day and don't want to break the bank,
Thali is for you!"}
{"text":"Had a meat thali and it was good and large enough to share, the price was right and the naan and butter chicken were pretty good, although the samosa was a bit on the doughy side. probably one of the better Indian options in the vicinity around Concordia."}
{"text":"YES! Good food, good value. The thali option is great but keep in mind that it is A LOT of food, even if only 9 or 10 dollars (including tax!). The lamb curry, butter chicken and aloo gobi were all delicious and flavourful. The naan was perfect. I also tried the masala dosa, which was good but way too carby for me.

A note - I found the food at thali to be only barely spicy, and I'm pretty sensitive to spice. So if you like that burn-in-your-mouth spicy curry that many other Indian restaurants provide, Thali is not the place for it. Thali is the place, however, to more than satisfy a hungry stomach with Indian flavours for not a lot of money.

It's a very casual set up. Pay at the cash, shift down and hand over the white slip to the person down the counter, and wait for food / point to what you want. There's self-serve ice water behind the counter.

Edit: went back and got the lamb wrap (5.50 incl. tax). so good!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE indian food. Majority of the food was spicy - but SOO good. Butter chicken is always a good one though. Plating size is very worth it - I can never finish all the food. Somosa's - yum! I believe I paid $11 - very good price for what I had. This is more of a place for quick eating. It's decor is not fantastic and the organization of tables is a little messy. But I'm here for food - so I don't really mind."}
{"text":"My wife is Malaysian and I lived there for 2 yrs. We had indian food almost everyday over there. Since we moved to Montreal 4-5 yrs ago we've been looking for authentic indian food that tastes like the one in Malaysia. Thali is it. Finally, after at least 8-9 different restaurants we found one that is exactly what we were looking for.

The dahl (they call is Sambar) is the best in Montreal, by far. I had been craving it since Malaysia and Thali got it right.

Prices are great and the staff nice. This is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS SO BUSY!! very convenient place to go and enjoy indian food, and inexpensive as well, for $10 dollars you get two Veg and non-veg option in a thali combo and 1 naan and rice included in it.....This is not a quality restaurant but more like a fast food indian curry joint which gives you tasty enough experience with their main dishes....their PALAAK PANEER(spinach with cheese), BUTTER CHICKEN, CHICKEN TANDOORI SANDWICH($5 dollar), SAMOSA are really good....3 star because of the quality as I have been tasting indian food for a long long time and i have been to Thali quite a few times as I am a student at Concordia, I dont know why but most of the time I got my combo food served cold or the food didnt seem fresh, but ehh there were couple of times it tastes better and i really liked it, so I guess they are not quite consistence with their food quality maintainance.....not judging lol.........food is good....atmosphere is good.....a lot of choices in the menu....you want to have a quick inexpensive indian meal......head to Thali Indian Cuisine yo!!!"}
{"text":"If you're on a budget and happen to be downtown, this is the spot to go to. ­For $10 tax included, you get a large platter that's enough to share for two (trust me, it's more than enough because the food is really filling).

The location is at Guy Concordia, conveniently close to the metro.  The standout dish is the curry lamb...like where else can you get lamb for $10? You can even get a mimosa for only $1! 

However, the room is a bit small, resembles an unkempt fast food restaurant. The naan bread can be a bit greasy, but still good. 

My bottom line opinion is to definitely treat yourself on a cold winter day if you're downtown.  I've officially found my go-to Indian food spot."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Indian restaurants I've been to. This is not authentic Indian food, most of it is watered down, generic and caters to the North American pallete. The ambiance is nice complete with authentic works of Indian art around but the food is terrible, if you are into Indian food and/or looking for a new Indian restaurant to try, I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I got a thali. The naan was a little too salty for my taste, but you get your money's worth ($9 not incl. tax) because the huge portion. I could've easily shared one thali with a friend. The service was great though! The staff was super nice and patient, they were constantly smiling. They gave off a really good vibe to every customer. The place isn't too big, so try not to come with a huge group of people!"}
{"text":"At Thali, the union of good quality, good quantity and good value come together to create the perfect conditions for a solid four star rating. They've got a good selection of Indian street food options. Pani puri (tiny pockets of crispy fried bread filled with spiced potatoes and chickpeas with coriander which you submerge in then fill with a coriander and tamarind liquid) is a favourite of mine. They've got bhel puri as well as papri chat. These are all very good. You'll find a buffet style concept wherein you'll be able to select a few options along with rice or bread and perhaps a simple green salad with yoghourt. The choices tend to be the flavourful North Indian classics ... such as ... matar paneer (homemade cubes of fresh whey cheese with green peas in a spiced tomato sauce) and chana masala (chickpeas simmered to perfection in aromatic spices) and saag paneer (more homemade cheese in a subtly flavoured creamed spinach) and an eggplant dish and a potato dish and all sorts of good things!! They've also got masala dosas if you're in a South Indian mood. The naan is excellent and so is the mango lassi."}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the worst Indian food places I've tried. I ordered palak paneer, mixed vegetable and daal. I don't think I could call it food at all. I cook better food out of grocery store frozen food packets.
I'm leaving most of my thali for the dumpster. 
Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst food you will ever eat especially if you are vegetarian. It's a disgrace to the Indian cuisine and the foreigners who come and taste it."}
{"text":"This is delicious and affordable Indian food. It's so affordable I almost want to offer more. Something so delicious seems like it should cost more, somehow! There is sometimes a lineup and there arent many places to sit but it's well worth the wait. It's no secret that this place is great so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"Thali is an excellent resto for dining in or taking out. They offer a combination of thali-style dining (a wholesome meal in one plate) as well as À La Carte dining.

It's a perfect downtown gem and hidden away on a quiet street in the Concordia university neighborhood. Its location works out to be a perfect playground to stop at during any time of the day.

Thali is definitely one of my favourite restos. Although their space is often packed and tight for room at times, this resto offers delicious and authentic North Indian food for great value. 

Best of all, they even have pani puri and chaat-style menu items which is super for the snacking crowd. In addition, they have a good selection of sweet dishes, including mango lassi & kulfis.

This place is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"The best authentic Indian restaurant in Montréal downtown. It's a super small place. Reasonable price. Every single dish is flavorful. Service is friendly and quick. 

Today I had Chana Bathura, good portion and super delicious. My sister had chicken; it was a huge portion and my sister devoured it. 

The place is always super busy. If you are early enough, there is a chance you will get seats.

I always recommended this place to all my family and friends... so far every single person I know has loved the food of Thali!"}
{"text":"Food looked really good, tasted awful. Waste of time, waste of money. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Thali satisfies the basest expectation you might have for desi food. Nothing to write home about. It feels that everything is produced from a frozen or packaged DEEP item and sprouted up with some fresh onion and cilantro. They have some mithai too if you're really craving some but lackluster at best. The plus side, I guess, is the price. It's definitely an affordable meal for a college student. Small tables that seat up to four people and the typical ambiance of a low end Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Super delicious and affordable Indian food. Their butter chicken is to die for. I literally ordered it 4 nights in a row! Their Nan is super fresh and home made. Can't miss!"}
{"text":"I love going to Thali! Few restaurants near Concordia manage to fill me this well at that price."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars! Good-warm-cheap-tasty! Joy! This is not a swanky chef's restaurant, but it is consistently good and reliable. Everything is reasonably priced. The seating is not abundant, so you may have to share during rush hour, but it's part of the experience."}
{"text":"Ah! There is nothing like a cafeteria. Raw and sentimental heartache relics of high school. The cafeteria is the great social schism. I couldn't sit with the cool kids because I was coming down with a fever that day. The jocks we're not shy with wedgies. I sat with the geeks, only because they thought I was good in math. Really I wasn't. All that fore wording to articulate that the restaurant does not serve tables. Order, receive and pay at the counter. 
Now, where do I socially belong? Where can I sit? Who can I sit next to? Fortunately, I was the only patron there. Painful introspection avoided!
I had the lamb and beef thali. I tasted a well blend of mustard seeds, cumin, chili and cloves. Well portioned and the spinach side dish was also of equivalent amount. I never enjoy the papadam or any, not just theirs."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. Cheap eats!! You get your bang for your buck here. Lots of meaty & vegetarian options.

2. Food is yummy. Their mango lassi is made with HOMEMADE yogurt which makes it really tasty.

CONS:
1. The silver platter thingy awkwardly sits on top of a tray.

OVERALL:
-Go here for a casual meal. I prefer this place than the indian buffet places around mtl."}
{"text":"Amazing curry. Sooooo affordable. Butter chicken is to die for. Chicken tikka done great. Been dozens of times and will go back. Their naan bread is wicked. Feels authentic in terms of the food. Minus the beef curry but still delicious. Go. Eat. Here. When you crave curry. 5 stars for excellent value to $ spent."}

Plus who wouldn't want to drink a Thums up soda during lunch time anyways!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"A south Asian place serving the biggest hits of Indian cuisine, with some personal twist on it.

I've had the followings:

The Kebab wrap, which is excellent. The Kebab is moist, while spicy at the same time. I always pay the extra 1$ to get Butter Chicken sauce inside of my warp. The contrast between the Roasted meat and the sweet and salty sauce is absolutely magical.

The various curries in a thali:

Some of them, such as the butter chicken, the lentil/pea based curries, and the Goat curry are amazing and has quite a lot of layers of complexity. Other curries such as the Potatoes and cauliflower tends to be a bit blander. Test them to see which one you prefer ;).

The Biryani is actually pretty good, packing both spices, quite a lot of meat and rice. Really refreshing Raita too.

The samosas, while packing flavour, tend to be on the smaller side of things for 1$, and the Gulab Jamun is microwaved."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian food downtown.  It's very authentic, inexpensive, and very tasty.  I like getting the curry chicken, it's quite spicy.  The butter chicken is also very good.  I also dip whatever is left with the naan bread.  It's not as spacious and a small deli style seating.  I always pick up or eat in there sometimes before it gets super packed.  Really really good Indian food."}
{"text":"I really can't believe I'm just now getting around to reviewing this place since we meet here for lunch or dinner at least once every couple of weeks.

As far as I'm concerned, it is the best of what this part of town does so well. A very satisfying amount of good food for cheap. I don't know how 'real deal' this Indian food is, but I promise that the average $10 price tag for some amazing eats does not leave me pondering the experience.

I pretty much always get the Thali, but recently I switched it up for the pita sandwich (which is a bunch of delicious stuff wrapped in naan bread) and was pleasantly surprised by the flavors."}
{"text":"Just off of Saint Catherine, this semi-vegan casual place has some amazing food! Try the chana bhature - you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Nice people, good food, cheap, this is a great place."}
{"text":"Decided to give this restaurant a shot after reading the reviews and it's not bad at all! The atmosphere isn't as quaint and not that spot clean either but the food looked okay. I had the starter and to be honest, I've had better than this before. It doesn't look promising and delicious. The food for their buffet doesn't seem fresh when you peep through the glass."}
{"text":"It's definitely a hole in the wall. Came here with my friends for a long weekend. Their food definitely has a kick to it. The best deal is to get a plate served cafeteria style with your choice of 2 meats and a veggie. Came out to about $10 per plate. 

Their butter chicken was very good, but the other curries didn't blow me away. Great place to eat after a few drinks."}
{"text":"The food flavors in this joint will not blow you away but for a 11$ (with taxes) non-veg Thali in downtown, it offers a pretty good deal. The butter chicken and lamb curry are good. So too are the matar paneer, chana and alu gobi. The naan literally drips oil or ghee and is a bit disgusting and the samosas or sweets are not very fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already, and I have to agree with some of the reviews here. It's cheap, but that's about it. The place is not very large and there are only about 10 tables all crammed into it. This evening a man inadvertently  slammed into his neighbour's table and knocked over one of said neighbour's dishes ....with the yet untouched food in it! That's how cramped the seating area is; as for the food, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The food is great! 
Thali (3 dishes, butter naan, rice and salad) for less than $10 (vege or non-vege).
If you like spicy food I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Some dishes are very delicious but some are not up-to the mark. Definitely try the Non veg thali especially with Butter chicken it's delicious. Palak paneer has been a real disappointment here should avoid at all costs. Ambiance is very desi which is a plus."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food downtown. I've only had the Thalis so I can't comment on the samosas and other fried goodies. For $10 or less you can get 3 choices of curries, basmati rice, a pakora and naan bread. Curries are less spicy than what you would find in park ex restaurants but they are still very tasty. I love being able to customize my thali (something you can't do at other Indian restaurants). The curries are laid out behind a window and you basically choose what you want cafeteria style. Not the type of resto you would take a date to but it does the job taste and price wise."}
{"text":"This is my only go-to take out spot. For price and quality it doesn't get any better than this. You are so full after the 9$ thali plate and don't forget to wash it down with their awesome mango lassi!"}
{"text":"This place is wicked! I definitely enjoyed eating here. The food is great and cheap.. just the way I like it. You will be full after eating here. 
I met a south Indian who was in Montreal for two months with work. When I ask whether he had been to this restaurant before his response was \"everyday\".
I had gotten a mango lassi with my meal (because i felt like spoiling myself). I was pretty good especially given the fact that it was pre-made. Just before leaving we ordered chai. It took a while to make it as it was made from scratch but was definitely worth the wait. It was one of the best chai I have had."}
{"text":"This is definitely my go-to Indian food restaurant in Montreal. 
It's TOTALLY satisfying every single time, fast, and really, really affordable. Perfect for a lunch fix when you're in a rush. Typically I share a plate with my lunch date, whoever it happens to be, because it's enough food for both of us, especially if we order an extra piece of naan. 

I'm going to keep this review simple, because the Thali experience is simple: order at the cash, pay, give your slip to the guy behind the food counter and select your choice of meat or veggie dishes from the buffet-type spread. Water is in a thermos-style jug at the side of the counter, and stainless steel glasses are stacked next to it. Serve yourself. 

It's always packed here but somehow you'll find a seat when you're ready to sit down. 

It's got sort of a seedy-type, hole-in-the-wall interior, but who cares? The food is worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered two combo plates and they had a good selection of meat and vegetables. Everything was good, definitely will be back. This place gets crowded, we were lucky to get there right before all the tables filled up."}
{"text":"Located just a few blocks from Concordia, it's tucked away on a side street ensuring cheap rent and awesome prices for some really delicious food.  The Tandori chicken was my favorite especially when eating it with garlic nan.  

It was a little intimidating the first time since the menu/ordering process wasn't totally clear for the buffet line, but when I approached with a deer in the headlights look the guy manning the cash register sorted me out.

For a treat I picked up a mango lassi which was decent enough for being more than an ocean's distance from any mango trees.

Thali works well as a quick and grungy establishment to stuff your gourd and carry on with your day.  The food is cheap, portions are large, and it's on your plate within minutes.  Thali also works when you are hankering for Indian food, not the best I've had but a decent approximation.

Bottom line, I'll be back for plenty more food at this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Amazing value for money!  Highly recommended.  

All prices include tax.  For $8 (veg.) or $9 (non-veg.) you will be completely filled by their 3-choice thali plates, which include salad, rice, NAAN, and papadum.
The $5 wraps are also a fantastic value/quality. 
The owner(?) and the gentleman with the turban are really nice.  

I wish they would offer a bhuna or rogan josh (fish as a protein would be nice too!), and the washroom and decor should be improved, but but at least they usually play decent Indian music, and not crappy Top 40 radio!"}
{"text":"Visited this place based on yelp reviews. Turned out to be a total disaster. I can see how this place got rated so high since most of the reviews are from non-indians.  Being an Indian myself, I wouldnt ever recommend this place to anyone. 

I ordered Daal Masala and mutter paneer. Both the dishes had a thick layer of oil floating atop. Daal felt more like water washed off lentils and mutter paneer was a joke. It turned out to be a soup of spices thrown with tons of peas and some teeny tiny pieces of paneer. 

They should be ashamed of serving such food to another Indian."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed at this place, their curry is not warm enough, my stomache does not feel well after eating their curry."}
{"text":"Indian food is my weakness, so descovering this place had a double importance for me: i needed to eat something quickly and i wanted to discover a new indien restaurant in Montreal.

The samoza was delicious, but very spicy and too many ingredients on the plate. Looking weird. The mango yogurt was too sweet. Why do they add so much sugar if they use good mangos. The condensed milk desserts were delicious. Prices were really friendly: CAD 12 for the meal.

The place is not for people who want to take their time, enjoying the meal in a nice atmosphere. It's crowdy, not very clean."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé un plat végétarien avec trois choix. Ça l'air pas mal dans la photo, mais il s'agit de légumes surgelé. Le naan n'est pas bien chaud et le riz n'est pas fraîchement cuit. Même si je suis pas une experte en cuisine indienne, je suis quand même capable si c'est frais ou pas. Même si ça goûte pas très bon, mais c'était quand même acceptable jusqu'à j'ai trouvé un cheveu noir, court et courbée dans dans mon riz!!!"}
{"text":"Enough is enough. I keep telling people to go here yet somehow forgot to throw my review into the ring. $10 for a large lunch, perfectly balanced spices and significant options. Served cafeteria style so the food is ready when you are and sitting in it's own spices until you're prepared to stuff your face. I have gone to \"high end\" Indian restaurants in Montreal and this is better than half of them. Stop in and eat and you'll understand."}
{"text":"Nice combo, i particularly dont like big chucks of beef thrown in a curry but it was good nonetheless.
Takeout would be better option as the place is quite small."}
{"text":"Awesome place. The food is delicious, the prices are super cheap and the staff was friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"It's more like a 3.5 star. 
Good value for money! Don't expect good atmosphere thought. 

Good:
-$10 for two meat, one veggie, rice, nann, papadum. 
-really good nann, soft but chewy at the same time, one wasn't enough to for me!
-really flavourful lamb, chicken and the eggplant and potato dish

Bad:
-not a great atmosphere, self-served, had to fight for seats
-bad mango lassi, tasted like powered drink

It's like a Indian food cafeteria, not with the typical French restaurant atmosphere that I really enjoy. But this would definitely be my go to spot to satisfy my Indian food craving."}
{"text":"I live around the block and never actually stopped by but I was feeling lazy to cook so I gave it a try. Honestly I'm surprised by how much food you get for 9$ veggie plate. I have had the chance to go to Southern India and although that doesn't make me a connaisseur I found the food to be similar in taste!
Removing 1 star because I feel the place needs a good clean. The floor under the buffet looked iffy so I feel this is one of those places you overlook the details due to the price and tasty food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This quick casual, no frills Indian place is popular with the college crowd but the quality of food makes it a good choice regardless of whether or not you're a student. If you're in need of a feast for cheap, this place won't disappoint. You get a very impressive load of food for $10 (veg thali) or $11 (nonveg): 3 curries, basmati rice, a papadum, and a huge fluffy piece of naan. Vegan options are clearly marked! The dahl was excellently spiced and my favorite of all the choices. Chana masala was the only veg option marked as spicy but was not as hot as I would have liked. But then again I prefer all my food to be on fire... don't you?"}
{"text":"Small and quaint with too many tables. It's very difficult to maneuver around, which sucked being they were busy!  Staff was nice and welcoming which I always like.
Sadly though that wasn't enough. The food was underwhelming. If they boosted the seasoning (not necessarily pepper) a few notches it would have helped flavor.

Anyway, the naan was salty (and I love salt), the curry lamb was bland and low on curry, the butter chicken lacked flavor, and the peas were also flavorless. I'm used to Indian food being rich with flavor....that was not the case here. The rice was fine and that seasoned cracker thingy okay.

Hopefully they can improve on flavor."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the last month and honestly, this place is by far the best place you can go for Indian food while on a budget. Keep in mind this might not be the best indian food out there but for the price (10$ for thali w/ 3 sides) it is unbeatable. That's not to say that the food isn't good however! I would say that its on par with most other places near the Concordia area just based on taste alone.

The place is rather small however, so one tip would definitely be to try to go early, at an off hour or for take out. Its definitely a popular place and there's nothing worse than not being able to find a spot to enjoy your meal! Overall, definitely would recommend, especially to students."}
{"text":"This is one of the best inidian restos in its class (low frills, low $) in Montreal. Run by friendly, happy people who can cook this spot was a real find (thanks Yelp). Went there with my girlfriend last night before going to the soulless AMC for soulless comedy. Definitely the best part of the night. Very tasty plate of food for $8. Guy came around to deliver steaming hot naan right out of the oven. Will definitely be going back. My only complaint is that it's not closer to my house and there's not much life in its neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The visual of the plate might not be satisfying, but this place is more like a \"quick take-out cafeteria\" than a restaurant.  If this was a serious restaurant for dating, eating out with family, and etc., I'd given 2 or 3, but c'mon, this place is cheap and fast.  We should appreciate that they have much better quality than other fast-food restaurants.  Service was also friendly, and you don't have to pay any tip.  Although it may not seem so when you first get the plate, three curries, naan, and rice will fill you up.  

Not the best I've experienced for the price in North America (that's why I'm giving 4, not 5), but still decent for price."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner while visiting Montreal and was underwhelmed. Had the beef curry, butter chicken and saag paneer. Every curry I had was runny and fairly bland. Don't see myself returning when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I went to eat there last night with my family so we were four walking in.
We wanted to eat indian and I saw this restaurant reviewed 4 out of 5 on yelp so decided to try it. 
I wanted to try it in the past but it was packed. 
So we walk in and it's pay at the counter thing. The tables are disposed to have the maximum capacity.. almost like a cafeteria. 

I have to say something, for the price, it was very cheap. it cost 41$ for the four of us and we were full. 

Since I am asian, I am used to eat spicy, and have tried a few indian restaurants. 

So no, it was not that good food. It was OK.
It was cheap I agree and quick food to get, so maybe if you're in a hurry.
Butter chicken was tasteless
Spicy chicken was spicy I agree
The curry beef ? okay that was ok
Naan was not hot
Rice was ok indeed
veggies were the best I believe too. 

It sucks to give two stars, but it goes with the i've experienced better. 
I haven't tried the mango lassi though..."}
{"text":"My go-to Indian delivery in Montreal. I haven't actually ever been to this restaurant, but I order from Thali several times a month, and it is always consistently delicious(which is rare for delivery!)
Normally, I get the butter chicken and the kebab appetizer and a serving of rice.... mouth-watering is probably the only way to describe it. Always tastes fresh and beyond flavorful."}
{"text":"Checked this place out again for a second time.

The first time? Food was crap, place was unhygenic and service was just really unfriendly.

Second recent visit? Oh boy how do I start? 

The service is still self serve. Although it really wouldnt hurt having a cheery person behind the counter. It will still give the place a nice restaurant vibe instead of the \"whats your order/the total/your order will be at the end of line\" Hmm..

The place however was a bit nicely kept this time, and more cleaner. I happened to visit them in the hottest of montreal summer heat days and them not having an AC or big windows just really didnt make me want to stay longer.

The food itself was a biiig negative to me. And honestly its not even that cheap. I found the prices standard in general. There are various \"cheap\" desi restos around  the desi bazaar location. So by saying that you are getting what you pay for is a lie. My mango lassi didnt even cut the mark of being a proper lassi (extremely sweet and watery).. and I only had ordered chana samosa. I dont know what they were playing here because my chana samosa was not even chaan samosa, they just put the daal with half raw samosas, a little yogurt with just a load of mint chutney. Mint chutneyy???  I couldnt even go half past the dish. On being a desi person and having eaten Various versions of chana samosa, I have never even seen a fusion style have mint chutney in it. I tried my husbands thali a little bit, and even that didnt taste anything special. I understand its hard to put a little bit changes in a dish especially when youre dealing with Indian food but they can at least try a bit more variations in their dishes :) On a positive note I think the place has potential if they improve the food quality for the same price.

Verdict: If I want to have home cooked indian food, I can just stick to my own kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and oh man this place is still so great! Cheap and delicious Indian food, what more can you ask for? My favourites will always be the butter chicken and the lamb curry, and their dal and chickpeas are great as well!! The thali buffet (2 meats + veg with rice and naan) is the 11$ go-to meal with generous portions."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the paneer wrap!!! Freshly baked naan bread filled with lettuce, red onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise, potatoes and paneer cheese. Messy to eat but so delicious! Perfect for those who don't want food that's too spicy. The thali is also excellent. The place is small but cosy, and the service is great. The prices are really affordable too. To be honest, I don't have anything bad to say about this place! They always exceed my expectations!"}
{"text":"It's usually very busy, but you can go for lunch when it's slow and have the place mostly to yourself. I love love love this food! Everything is delicious, and you can try a bunch of things. It's a great deal, except the lassi, which is fantastic but a little expensive for what you get. I still get it nearly every time! Spiciness is perfect--it's got a kick but it's not all you taste. One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Best mango lassi I've tried! Although, it's kinda pricey ($3), staff is very nice, and I like that they did not watered down the spice of the food for tourists, they stay true to their flavours"}
{"text":"If you are looking for quite less expensive Indian meal in the middle of downtown, then this is it. Food tastes ok to be frank. 
But I will give thumbs up for the service it is quick. 
I have been there 4-5 times now, non-veg thali is on my hit list there. 
Tried Chana Bhatura once, did not like the chana and bhatura was also ok."}
{"text":"Ok, so the curries were decent, the portion generous at super reasonable prices, but to give Thali 4 or 5 stars would be injustice to great Indian restaurants elsewhere in the city. I was mostly unimpressed by their rice, which was as plain as a white t-shirt. No (obvious) seasonings, which in turn led to no wonderful aromas that typically come with Indian rice. Their naan was also soggy and tasted like plain thick bread. Most of all, I was disappointed in my butter chicken, which tasted spicy, but nothing else. Having said that, I admit that I like my butter chicken a little sweet, so perhaps this is just a matter of preference. I still enjoyed my meal, but it fell short of my expectations, especially after having read the rave reviews writted by other Yelpers."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is right. A good deal, a good portion, a good vegetarian option. The lassi is a bit expensive (3 bucks) especially considering that 7.50 grants you rice, papadom, fresh bread ans 3 curries. I love this place. I love how they say they wanted to bring \"Parc-Ex\" flair downtown. I love the lapdidadida dadadiiiidada playing in the back. It is just so freaking charming! 

The restaurant has a really legit dining room and great places nearby the window. Sit your ass there have a shot. The curries aren't fancy at all, a bit on the bland side and somewhat untextured. But still... quality/price ratio is just that much awesome. 

So yeah... you must add it to your list...!"}
{"text":"Good fast and cheap Indian food. Not the best in Montreal, for that head over to Park Extension or go to Ganges, but Thali is fine if you're down town, need good Indian (stay away from Buffet Maharaja!)
Their Mango Lassi is excellent!"}
{"text":"A secret gem off the path. Delicious and quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"There's no place you'll find such delicious Indian food for so cheap! 9$ gets you two meat choices, a veggie, rice, salad, papadum and naan...I mean, come on! The mango lassi is also a win!"}
{"text":"Simple, inexpensive, and quick! Good for lunch and dinner. The staff is friendly, and the food is delicious. The only real downside is that the place is small, and with the tables and many patrons, can feel a bit cramped. Great authentic indian sweets! Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian food, quick service, great price. I eat mostly the vegetarian dishes from there, but have heard that the meat ones are just as good."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal from the US and happened to discover this little know spot. The platters are more than a complete meal (with only the dessert missing) with large and testy portions at great prices.  Being close to McGill and Corcordia the restaurant  keeps the prices low as they cater primarily to students.

Decor is simple and very low key but the restaurant, tables, utensils etc are clean and not getto. 

Coming from NY where there is no shortage of Indian Restaurants I was impressed with this place. If you are craving some good Indian food without breaking your budget try it out. You wont be disappointed. Tasty food atreasonable prices."}
{"text":"By far the best choice for Indian in the downtown area. Veggie pakora, chana samosa, veggie thali and ras malai are all great. Chana samosa is the best choice if youre in a hurry.  The best curry choice is the saag paneer. 

I love their reusable dishes!! Thank you! They have consistent friendly service also."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and is my favorite place for Indian food. Everything here is delicious, the service is fast and the prices are very affordable. Great place if you are a student or if you are on the constant lookout for an affordable place to eat. I love their butter chicken, their curries, and their aloo gobi...is that how you spell it? Hmm...well anyway, regardless if you are hungry or thirsty you have to try their mango lassi. A delicious blend of mango and yogurt that will refresh you and make you feel better regardless of the season or temperature. Good place to bring your vegetarian friends or even a date. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food at Thali is great and certainly beats some of the indian food I have had at other expensive indian restaurants.  The price is cheap (about $9 for a combo plate that includes 2 meat choices, 1 veggie, rice, salad and naan - it is cheaper if you want vegetarian).  The choices are pretty good, there is butter chicken, a few curries and a bunch of vegetarian dishes.

Recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant has much improved since it first opened and they now have great food with fantastic portions and amazing prices. I am a huge fan and love having it in the hood"}
{"text":"Very spicy !!! Big portions , low price, few tables and nice service. Little oldy decoration and doubful cleanliness but i did not get sick , was good taste."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a great price.. The place is way too small and IMO, it should be more of a take-out/delivery place than a sit-down place but the food is just great! They really need to hook-up with Just-eat or A-la-carte."}
