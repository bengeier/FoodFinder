{"text":"Oh man, food and coffee are incredible! The presentation is amazing, the place is so cute and everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very nice, very clean! Everything is fresh made including the coffee which is roasted on premises. Ordered a double espresso, a donut croissant, Carmel macchiato and a bowl of the soup of the day (cream of potato). The soup was spectacular. Potatoes and little chunks of sausage... So savory. The donut croissant was amazing. Served on a chocolate sauce with chocolate inside like a molten lava cake. Absolutely delicious! The espresso was positively rich with a much less pronounced bitterness than you would typically expect from an espresso. Must be due to the in house roasted beans, so fresh! As it says on the door, best quality and based on my first visit I'd agree. I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is cute little cafe! I came here with a friend and for the prices you get so much food! It is such good food and the ladies working were very nice and attentive, and the cook was super nice and let us taste their house made croissant which was super good! I will be coming here again!"}
{"text":"Order some french toast, eggs, bacon and fruit. Food wasn't bad at all. Extremely over priced however. Happy with my meal but I don't think I'll be back unfortunately because of the cost. Definitely worth trying it out once though."}
{"text":"This place is really nice. They are pricey but when you eat you don't even mind. The food is some of the best I have ever eaten. My only hope is they get some permanent staff. Each time you go they are training someone and they do not know whats going on."}
{"text":"We are thrilled to see new restaurants open in the West valley. So, I had to try this place out. It's family owned and operated, which makes it dear to my heart. I am a huge supporter of family owned businesses. We need more of them. Now, to review what is this restaurant like.... It is modern and nicely decorated. The servers were young and friendly. The owner, who I believe is also the chef, came out and asked how I liked the food.  I came in on a Saturday and ordered the breakfast club that was recommended by my waitress. She did inform me that the kitchen is backed up, place wasn't busy, and it can take up to 20 minutes for my food to come out. My food came out in 15 minutes and it was good. The presentation was beautiful.  The bacon was a little too greasy for my taste. Otherwise, the food was very good. The coffee, I ordered the medium roast, was delicious. I highly recommend trying this restaurant. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am a big Eggs Benedict fan and it was fantastic! Thickest Canadian bacon I've ever seen anywhere on this dish. Followed it up with a doughnut croissant. Service was terrific, everyone including the chef was very attentive. We will be back.  Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Good quick relaxing place to be woth family and freinds. I would definitely go here again and is a favourite place of mine."}
{"text":"Great environment inside, nice people. We had the purple monster smoothie. Which is really pretty but not very tasty and seems to have nuts in it so don't order if you have allergies. Probably everything else on the menu is fine."}
{"text":"This place has the best coffee and espresso in the Glendale area, period.  If that's all you're looking for then it's a 5 star cafe. Coffee prices are reasonable too.  The only reason it's a 4/5 for me is that their food, while great, is slightly over-priced. That being said, I don't mind spending a little extra to support a locally owned place.   Service is excellent and the owner is nice to chat with. Overall, this is my go-to cafe in Glendale."}
{"text":"What a great little cafe.  Kind of hard to find; located in the same plaza as the Home Depot at 59th Avenue and Loop 101. My wife and I ordered Kahlua banana french toast, pancakes, two eggs, bacon, and fruit.  Food tasted great and was served hot and fresh and was clearly made to order.  Service was wonderful and the environment clean and cozy.  They also roast their coffee beans on site and many customers say their coffee offerings are as good or better than Starbucks.  Their breakfast and lunch menus are not huge, but they offer enough variety that my wife and I found several items that we would like to sample on our next visit.  Love finding local restaurants that serve better meals than the overrated chain restaurants that seem to overwhelm north Glendale.  Will definitely come back to Black & White Cafe!"}
{"text":"There coffee was pretty good! I tried it when they did a soft opening! Super cute place!"}
{"text":"We both had Eggs Benedict. The food and presentation was very good.   I had a club sandwich today. It comes with a salad and chips. The sandwich and the salad were very good."}
{"text":"Not a fan. cold brew tasted bitter and like it was burned. was charged for a splash of milk and not a comfortable working spot. might be good for breakfast or lunch, but not for reading or working."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium roast drip coffee, black : if they can serve a delicious, straight up brew well, other items might be as delicious. Coffee was smooth and bright with a slightly fruity finish. They nailed the coffee, so we tried the cronut, which is made to order: it was hot, fluffy, and topped with powdered sugar and honey. The cronut was delicious. The ambiance is modern and clean and the music was nice.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great food and terrific coffee of all types! I would highly recommend for breakfast as everything they have is really great!"}
{"text":"Finally! West Valley has a cafe with organic coffee, delicious breakfast and lunch menu and it's privately owned. So this means the owners are on site (family owned ) and you can see they take pride in this wonderful, cozy spot where you can come in to chill with a delicious brew, meet friends for a bite or find a corner to catch up with some work or conduct a meeting. I've done all! They have a nice patio (only six -four tops inside) but I like the cozy coffee spots. It's my new stop when I do a post office run (across street) or meet up with West valley friends. Doru and Luana (owners) are so friendly as well as the staff (great service). I eat gluten free and they modify the meal to accommodate me- I love the pesto grilled chicken sandwich ( of course without the bread - he substitutes that with a nice spread of greens). Try the lavender latte! I took great pics but not sure I can post them in this review. So glad to find the perfect coffee spot off the Loop 101! And thanks to Yelp I found his place sooner than later!"}
{"text":"I feel bad for giving a new non-chain business 1 star but seriously get your sh*t together. Half the bread options were not available because \"we just opened\", free WiFi is advertised but \"it's not available\", staff was extremely inattentive, it look 45 mins to make sandwiches and the food did not even come out at the same time. By the time the last members of my party got their plates the rest of the table had been done eating for about 10 mins. Oh and the orders were not 100% right but there was no use in mentioning anything because we didn't have time to wait another 45 mins."}
{"text":"Really good coffee. If that is what you want you are in good shape. If you are looking for a sit down to eat place, they clearly do. It have any restaurant experience. Details missed, slow service and a complete lack of organization by all staff. Took over 30 minutes before our food order was even taken and 20 minutes later asked about protein option.   If they can get their service down and maybe hire some experienced restaurant staff, I'm sure they will do amazing."}
{"text":"We were excited to try something new; we can't stand \"biscuits\" a block away.    It's clean & neat inside, very generic and boring.   The staff is really sweet & friendly but I think if they get busy; a lot of confusion could ensue.   They kind of seem to step all over each other.    Espresso is a bit bitter & shots are pulled too long;  coffee is a very light roast; not much flavor.    Breakfast.   Meh.   It's edible but nothing exciting.     What's interesting is they promote (website) their fresh baked croissants etc; yet none were offered or on display at 9 am.    Would love to see them grow & be successful.   On the fence at this time tho.    We are rooting for you!  Give them a shot ...let's help them do this."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and my club sandwich was very good.  It came with a salad that was delicious, also.  I will try breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here! I got in about 930am to get some coffee and sit and do some work. The girls that were in store we're all very friendly and helpful! I ended up ordering a Caramel Macchiato (which was so good, better than sbux) since I wasnt quite hungry but knew I was going to order food later. While I worked the girls were always checking up and making sure I was still doing alright!    The only thing I found weird was that they stopped serving breakfast at 11:15am but don't start serving g lunch until 12pm. Which happened to fall in the time when I was looking to order lunch. The owner, I believe, said it would be no problem to order lunch now but I decided to wait till 12 anyways since I still had some more work to do!   I was a bit worried about prices at first but you definitely get what you pay for! I ordered the BLT was pleasantly surprised that it came with chips and a side salad! It was definitely delicious!   I will definitely be returning in the future when I want a nice place to relax and do some computer work!"}
{"text":"If you are looking to grab a good cup of coffee, eat something sweat or just good food, you came to the right place. I love the European style this place has.   The owner cares about his customers and spoils them occasionally. Today he decided to walk around and give high end chocolate truffles .  Overall, this place is great and the dishes are always above my expectations. One could see the dishes are made with love!"}
{"text":"Like one of the previous reviewers we felt bad about posting a bad review for a newer place... We really wanted to love this place since it's close by, but they don't even remotely have their act together. We came on the weekend for breakfast or brunch... and we're told not after 11:30am What?? That should be something that should be available until 2 or 3 pm on the weekend! So, we decided to have the soup, something they specialize in... get this... we were told that they didn't have soup because they're \"going to serve burgers tonight\"... What??! What does that even mean? Noonish on the weekend, and they don't even have soup?? And what on earth does that have anything to do with burgers being sold hours later? We're very disappointed and just left... it's too bad and our family will not be back unless they get multiple rave reviews, when and if they get their act together, so we'll just stick to the regular Mainstays in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place literally has the BEST food!!! And the service is always pleasant and welcoming. I crave their chicken pesto sandwich and the dressing on the salad is out of this world. The ONLY downside is their only brewed coffee option is a dark roast. I'm a light/medium roast kinda person, and I don't drink espresso. It would be nice to just be able to come, sit, enjoy a cup of coffee. Other than that, the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"We have been twice yummy food and great service! Will be back soon forsure! Happy to have a great local restaurant it's about time arrowhead is a lovely area to have new good restaurants"}
{"text":"Checked out this awesome little cafe this morning while waiting for tires to be rotated on the car. First time here so the server suggested three of her favorite breakfasts which we opted for the Norwegian Benedict.  She said it would be savory and it really was. This picture is of a split portion as my husband and I shared. Also came with a bowl of very fresh and tasty fruit. I would recommend his cafe. I enjoy supporting local business and I hope this is one that will flourish. Great service, super cute atmosphere, and very delish!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise!  We've been driving past this little place since it opened recently.  We decided to stop in for breakfast today.  Fresh, fabulous choices and really excellent coffee.  We had the Breakfast Club and Benedict Florentine.  Both were great. The lunch menu looks very compelling as well.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious coffee and breakfast!  Coffee was so good I bought some beans. Been twice and food was awesome both times- French toast and an omelette.  Service was great too.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We are just leaving this place.... And I couldn't wait to leave the review.  This place is GREAT!!!  The decor is so fresh and clean. I love their unique style menus on the doors to the kitchen and on the walls. The staff was extremely nice and VERY attentive. The two ladies working in the front were so sweet. Checked on us a few times through out the meal. By the end of the meal the cook came out and was making sure everything was good. He was very nice and talked to us about the restaurant.  The food is on another level than any other on the westside.  I had the egg white scramble and my dad had the eggs Benedict. We also shared a donut Croissant. The eggs scramble was delicious. I loved the fresh veggies inside. The fruit and potatoes it came with were so fresh and delicious. I LOVED the toast on the side!! It was really good. My dads eggs Benedict was one of the best he has ever had. I'm not a fan usually but I had a few bites!! It was so so good!! The hollandaise was so creamy and buttery. The ham was so thick and the English muffin was so toasty. Last but certainly not least, the donut croissant! Yum!!!!! It has honey and powdered sugar on it! It was delicious.  I am so excited to bring other people back with me! I'm so glad we have a good restaurant on this side of town! I will be back for lunch soon."}
{"text":"My 90 y/o mom and I just had lunch here. The food was excellent and the cafe is clean and modern and yet cozy. The service was great! Price was a little on the high side. We really wanted breakfast but we were a bit too late. Just remember that they stop serving breakfast at 11:15. I can't wait to go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"I ordered a caramel macchiato and Belgian waffle thinking I'd have a quick lunch.  The latte came out in a timely fashion and tastes good, but over 30min later and I still did not receive my waffle. The two gentlemen who ordered after me received their hot bfast plates before me. The 2 baristas did not notice that I still did not have my order. I ended up asking for it to go since I did not want to waste anymore time sitting there. By the time I walked out the two gentlemen were done eating.   The decor is nice, the coffee is good, but the food service was a total disappointment. And the amount Belgian for $7 is not worth the value.  Edit: just looked at my waffle and after all that wait the bottom is completely burnt! Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Loved this place when it first opened. They had some issues assumed they work out the kinks after first opening but service has gotten worse and the food quality has gone down hill with service. Tried it serval times hoping it would get better ... bit not the case. Can't support it anymore, don't even like giving poor reviews. Hopefully they will take it is as constructive critism and correct their issues!"}
{"text":"What a great little cafe located right next to where my wife and I live! It's not very big but it sure does pack a punch of flavor and freshness. My wife ordered the Phoenix omelet and I had the American breakfast and they were both delicious and just the right amount of food. We also had an Americanos to go with our breakfast and they were also very delicious. We will definitely be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"This cute little cafe just opened right by my house and I've been looking forward to trying it. My husband and I came here today for a quick bite. So they stop serving breakfast at 11:15am and lunch at 3pm. We got here at 2:50 just in time to grab a sandwich. My husband got the club added avocado which they didn't add ( it was added to my side salad ?) I got the smoked turkey sandwich. So they come with a salad and fires. Took about 20min to make. Our food was very tasty but totally not worth $10. I would like to try the pastry's at some point and breakfast. But the food is tasty really good just way to overprice.."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday morning with my laptop to study and get some work done, and I left immediately with my coffee. I'm a little bit confused whether this is a coffee shop or a breakfast restaurant. On a Sunday morning, it is definitely a breakfast/brunch place. It is a very small place with about six 4-person tables and barely any room to walk when the tables are occupied. The coffee was good though, and is less expensive than other independent coffee places."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant since it was open. I stopped about 2 months ago because the price did not reflect the quality. Way too much for what it cost.  Besides, the owner refuses to have decaf available.  This morning I decided to give it another try to see if there have been any improvements. I ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine. I was also really in the mood for a croissant and waitress said they are made in their kitchen.  Well, the eggs Benedict were above average. Everything else was not.   The coffee was no better then Circle K;  The music was a local radio station that hardly played music but blabbed gibberish and not relaxing at all; I never got a refill on the coffee, even when I requested a refill.;  The croissant was the worst I have ever had in my life. The croissant came covered in honey which I returned. The next one had a light sugar glaze and when I pulled it open it was hard and dense inside. It tasted awful. The only thing that was \"croissant\" about it was the shape. When I complained again the waitress told me that the croissants come frozen and not made fresh there.  The owner should re-assess the quality of the coffee, sound and service. If I'm going to pay $15 for breakfast then I expect much better then I got.  I gave this place another try after 2 months. I will not give it another one."}
{"text":"We had our second breakfast at this cafe and it was remarkable!  My wife had a veggie omelet with fresh fruit and roasted red potato quarters.  I had the Eggs Benedict and it was the best I have had in the valley.  The Hollandaise was perfect with intermittent dots of Tabasco; ribbon, not thick or broken.  The eggs were also cooked the way I prefer:  yolks were about one quarter hard and three quarters runny. Sliced fresh fruit and roasted red potato. I always say \"you have to try hard to screw up breakfast\". You also have to try hard to make it perfect!  This was perfect. Everything is made to order so it takes a little more time."}
{"text":"Very kind staff, you can tell that they put a lot of love and effort in running their cafe. I went close to closing and ordered a peach smoothie which was a variation of the monster smoothie. Delicious and fresh! It didn't taste processed or overly sugary. Can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"This is an cute Cafe that just opened recently. I love the atmosphere inside and the customer service was great. It took 30 min to get the food but they told us in advance it would be that long. My whole meal was only $7!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast with my son here and I have to say this place is where you want to go for breakfast! We are looking forward to coming back for lunch. Friendly staff and owner. Cozy atmosphere and the food was excellent. Welcome to the neighborhood, Black and White Cafe!"}
{"text":"I can't speak to the food as we haven't tried any of it. Went there just today to try out their coffee selections. Girlfriend got a chai latte and I got their cold brew on the recommendation of the cashier. She assured me it was much stronger than their iced coffee.   Her chai was bitter and tasted more like a dirty chai than a latte, and my \"strong\" cold brew was actually very weak. Makes me wonder if they got it mixed up. I might go back and give it another chance but it definitely didn't make a great first impression."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! The food, staff, atmosphere, and location are AMAZING! If you haven't tried this new place, put it at the top of your list. We, initially, went to Biscuits Cafe, right down the street. The line was out the door, as alway. We quickly remembered B&W Cafe and walked out the door. We were very happy we did. We will choose B&W Cafe, every time, from now on!! Believe me, you won't be disappointed. Kim and Dean"}
{"text":"Bad weekday study vibe and meh coffee. Came in to read, but did not find a chill coffeehouse atmosphere. Loud country music and the cashier talking loudly with her friend about guns. The coffee was trying to be unique, but whatever flavoring or roasting they tried, did not work."}
{"text":"I love this cute little cafe! The food was absolutely amazing. The service was great and the chef was so friendly with the customers. The design and set up inside was so aesthetically pleasing. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I will be frequenting often. From the decor to the presentation of the food to the restroom even, everything was perfect. I ordered a vanilla latte and a croissant doughnut, both of which were heaven. One of my colleagues ordered lunch and her plate looked so so good. The inside is decorated beautifully and they even have chairs and tables outside to enjoy the beautiful weather. The restrooms even had perfumes and lotions to use! The chef even brought our table a complimentary coffee dessert. This place is between Home Depot and the mattress store. Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Food is good, but overpriced. I got a cup of cold brew and French toast with kalua soaked bananas and it was $15. No sides at all. Just 2 slices of French toast with the banana sauce and my coffee. Flavor was good, but likely won't return. The salad and some of the other menu items are overpriced too for what you get. A bit of a disappointment."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning. Cute little place with very nice servers. However, they have some kinks to work out. I ordered a side of bacon which I never got and later learned they do not have a button to add on sides. My husband asked for extra crispy bacon and his was not crispy at all. The biggest issue was the two hairs served on my Benedict. They remade it, but this is a pretty significant issue and they offered no discount or even a coffee on the house while I waited for my meal to be remade. Then they forgot to bring my fruit that comes with the meal. I hope this cute little place works out the kinks because it's nice to have a little cafe in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"First time here, but I'll definitely be back. I went with a healthy option. I was tempted by the delicious looking pastries, but I held strong!  The coffee was rich. The food was simple and prepared perfectly.  The chef came out and shared a box of chocolates with the patrons.  Nice guy!"}
{"text":"First off,they advertise themselves on yelps as a juice bar. They only serve orange and apple juice....  secondly, since we were there, we decided to order an egg sandwich. We ordered one with sausage, it came with bacon instead. While we were waiting we noticed other mix ups. Lastly, my wife and I ordered cold brew coffees. Hers was fine, mine looked dirty cloudy water and didn't taste right. I threw it away. I know this is a new business and seemingly have a lot to learn.  Appears they need better management."}
