{"text":"Excellent Indian food!! We ordered veggie dishes and they were all amazing. The naan is huge! We have leftovers for days and the price was exceptional for great food. This is our go-to Indian food place. The Nepalese food looks amazing too - can't wait to try it!"}

{"text":"Everest is clearly the best kept secret here in the Northwest for Nepalese food (it's been open for about four months).  Although the takeout business was fairly brisk that evening, the boys and I were a little leery when we saw the 15-minute parking signs outside and only seven tables inside the restaurant.   We were greeted pleasantly by Arjun, the new owner, who seated us immediately.  He was very attentive and took the time to describe some of the menu items for us and answer questions about the ingredients in some of the dishes (our son has a mild peanut allergy).  After a few sips of our mango lassis(which were sweet, tangy and creamy), we ordered two appetizers:  fish pakoras and chicken momos. These were the best fish pakoras I've ever eaten--the tender, flaky morsels of fish were ever so lightly battered in an aromatic chickpea batter and served with a refreshing mint chutney.  Since the thinly wrapped chicken momos (served with grilled tomato chutney) were steamed, you could really taste the wonderful flavours of the mildly spiced chicken filling.    For our main dishes, we tried one of the Nepalese traditional dishes, Everest Sekuwa. The marinated chicken pieces were grilled in a clay oven and served on a sizzling plate with onions and green peppers.  Laden with spices (but not overpowering), the chicken was meltingly tender and caused a little \"flavour explosion\" inside our mouths.  The lamb curry was also tender and perfectly seasoned.  My son's butter chicken pizza was very good (topped with tandoori chicken, green peppers, red onion, and mozzarella), he loved the generous topping of gooey, stringy, cheese!  For our side dishes, the Aloo Gobi (cauliflower and potatoes with ginger, garlic, curry and turmeric) was cooked until tender but not mushy.  The coconut Basmati rice was fragrant and the butter naan was soft and fluffy (not chewy at all).     With all these wonderful authentic dishes practically at our doorstep, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I first heard about this place in calgary sun newspaper rated excellent by Bill kaufmann. Amazing service..... the best Nepali food i ever tasted. The flavor and presentation, reasonable price all together it is excellent. I would definitely recommend it . They delive takeout too!"}
{"text":"We had a great dine-in experience, on par with another, larger Himalayan restaurant on 17th Ave SW. Service was outstanding, and on a subsequent visit I found their portion size for takeout is generous. If you're in NW Calgary and have a hankering for Nepalese, definitely check them out. Warning: this place is tiny, so call ahead if you want to get a table."}
{"text":"This replaced a previous Indian/Pizza restaurant in the same location, and is under new management to go with the new name. They have added dine-in tables for sit-down service as well.  We ordered the Butter Chicken, Rice, Garlic Naan, and two pizzas. Everything was excellent, the Butter Chicken is easily as good as the version that was famous at the previous establishment, the Garlin Naan was very large and quite tasty, and the pizzas were very good with a nice crust and generous toppings and cheese (but not too much).  I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best curry I have ever had. The owner is so attentive and genuine, it was a pleasure to dine here. This will definitely become a staple in our home!"}
