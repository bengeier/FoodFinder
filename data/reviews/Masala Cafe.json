{"text":"Ughs, such a disappointment in terms of Sri Lankan food in the area. The consistency is off in terms of Taste - one day it's really good, the other it's stale. The stringhoppers (idiyappam) are so small for what you at, sometimes you get half a piece."}
{"text":"Would never order here ever again because of how vast their inconsistencies with their food is. SAME PRICE, but two VASTLY DIFFERENT PORTIONS. TASTES LIKE SADNESS MAN. Ordering here is like playing the lottery, 99% chance of lossand momey dowm the drain.

How could someone pay $8 for one thing and then order it again, same price, and get a chicken thigh with no meat on it, drier than the sahara desert with the texture of tree bark, and still be like ok yeah i'd still love to order from this place?

I called in and they said I didn't select a Medium or Large option, I just ordered it how I did last time which was select the Chicken Briyani option and PAID. BAM. So here I am expecting the same thing I had again but no it was a sad excuse for food.

Listen if you look at the two pictures you clearly see the difference and moreso, I PAID THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY BOTH TIMES, I ALSO ORDERED IT THE SAME WAY. But whoever picked up the phone insisted that I didn't get what I had last time because I didn't pay extra.

Fam if I didn't pay extra before and got an actual edible dish, why do I have to pay extra now? So you can rip me off?"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their CHICKEN BRIYANI. 
The portions are MASSIVE.
Looking forward to trying out the rest of their menu just as soon as I can get over my briyani addiction! lol!"}
{"text":"Without the doubt - way up there on the freshness and flavors of Sri Lankan cooking.  Had take-out from there tonight.  Chicken biryani, which was comprised of a chicken curry and chicken tandoori with biryani rice.  Spouse had the lamb kotthu.  And a couple of fish patties.

Comforting, warm, wholesome spicing, and real, genuine, no pretense food on a Friday night after a long week - makes everything feel good again.  Love this place."}
