{"text":"Food sucks.  Had the short rib sandwich and it was all flabby fat and gristle.  Service on outdoor patio was slow.  Why go back?"}
{"text":"Metropolitan Cafe is located in such a neato area after walking pass the desolate area where my hotel was.  We sat outside in the patio, great for people watching.  

Our server was great, informing us to get the daily special fish instead of the one in the menu for a unique experience.  She was very knowledgeable of wine, choosing a great pinot noir for my friend and a sauvignon blanc for me.

I had the sockeye salmon which was delicious and not dried out.  The spinach was however very greasy though.  My friend had the grouper with lobster risotto.  The grouper was great but the risotto was pack with lobster but lack in flavor.  It was Boston prices around $26-40 for an entree.

I loved the service and her knowledge of the menu and wine which helped in my experience with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the Metropolitan Filet -- the Steak was excellent, and the cheese & cranberry was just right, not too strong or sweet. The risotto was disappointing though, something about the texture was a bit too far on firm past al dente.

Service was great."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, and the drinks are strong.  The menu and venue are very swanky; if you do go here, dress nicely, be sure to have a reservation, and be prepared to spend just a little bit more than you might be comfortable with.  

I've been here twice, and everything I've tried here has been wonderful.  On my first visit, I came in without a reservation, and had a ridiculously long wait.  I'd like to mark them down for this, but honestly, everything I've eaten here more than made up for it.  Just, be forewarned.  Call ahead for a better evening."}
