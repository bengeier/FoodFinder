{"text":"The Madison City Tins directed us to this quaint spot for Sunday brunch and it was spectacular!  The exec chef was working double time- filling in for an ill server and whipping up phenomenal food.  He recommended dishes and the turned out great!  We each had the spicy tomato soup as a starter along with a bloody mary and blood orange mimosa.  The panko-pecan crusted trout was light yet hearty and the rosemary potatoes were a nice compliment.  The \"so many cheeses i forgot all of them\" omelet was cooked to perfection and the side salad (with pomegranate seeds, pecans and goat cheese with a hint of lemon) was yummy.  
The cafe is located within an artisan space so there is plenty to view before and after the meal.  There is a small patio overlooking a river that would be divine in the summer time.   We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch on a lawn overlooking a stream in a rural town....of course it is 5 stars.  In all honesty, they would have had to actively work to screw this up.

Brunch on the lawn was amazing.  We arrived around 10:30 and stayed for 2 hours, taking our sweet time - and they never once hinted at rushing us.

So, like I said, they would have had to try to screw up the rating just from the atmosphere alone.  The coffee was excellent, no complaints.  But the food, dear lord.  

GF ordered a bruschetta sandwich and for fun put bacon on it.  The chevre melted beautifully, the bread was hearty and perfectly toasted and the basil was obviously as fresh as it gets.  I am not sure what bacon they use but it is thick cut and cooked to a perfect compromise - crispy without losing all of its fat and deliciousness.  The side salad was light and amazing.  I know all of this because I was actively working to steal everything on her plate.

We split a bowl of tomato soup with blue cheese - it did not last long.  Spicy without being hot - it had more flavor in it than a bloody mary.  Simply fantastic.

I had the sweet potato quiche, which as the least favorite items, was still better than 95% of brunch items usually found (at other places).  In comparison to the soup and bruschetta sandwich, it was awful.  In comparison to brunches at other restaurants, I would order it a dozen times over.  It was great - just not nearly as great as the other items.

As we drive past this place 2-3 times a month to visit family in Green County, we will be visiting again, without a doubt.  The only thing is that I will likely not bring the kids - not because it is not kid friendly but because they just would not appreciate the quality of the food and the serenity of the space."}
{"text":"Firstly, Paoli is such a cute, little community that is really fun to visit. Secondly, Creamery Cafe is a great place to eat! You can sit outside along a pretty stream and enjoy the wonderful food that's been prepared for you. The menu and specials are alwasy interesting and made with local ingredients. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We rode the Badger trail from Madion to Paoli and stopped at this cute cafe.  Husband had a rhubarb roll (kind of like a cinnamon roll, but not as sweet and made with rhubarb.  It was pretty good.  I had a delicious panini made with tender smoked chicken, smoked cheese and thinly sliced apples.  It came with a small mixed green salad.  The ice tea was excellent.   I thoroughly enjoy my lunch.  All this yummyness with a view of the pretty sugar river.  Luckily, it wasn't too much food since we had a 20-mile return trip.

The service was quite good and they filled up our water bottles with ice water for the return trip.  The restroom facilities were very nice and they share a space with a neat art store that also sells jewelry."}
{"text":"Took a bike ride down the Badger State Trail from Madison to Paoli and stopped in for lunch at Creamery Cafe. Seated on the lawn (yeah, there are tables and chairs) with a nice scenic view of the river. Kissy ordered the BLT with avocado, and Jack the Ham and Gruyere Sandwich. Both came with seasonal side salads. The sandwiches were outstanding! Jack asked for a side of mayo as usually sandwiches are too dry for his liking, but this had such a perfect dijon spread that nothing else was needed. The ham was real ham, not some cheap thin slices. Salads were oh so good too.
We also ordered a cup of soup to share. Very nice portion for just being a cup. It was a spinach soup, which was a bit hearty for a summer soup, but awesome nonetheless.
The waiter was great. Love this place!!
Kissy and Jack"}
{"text":"This place is out of business. Those of you with unused 2014 city tin coasters are out of luck. I wish I had called before I biked all the way to Paoli with hopes of visiting this place...."}
{"text":"70 degrees and sunny...nice outdoor seating area next to the river. Relaxing and quiet. Blood orange mimosa, trout scramble and breakfast panini are all good. Te little art gallery is cute as well.  I would love to give this place four stars, but our waitress was just way too weird.  She seemed a little full of herself.  When we walked up to the window she just stood there and looked at us.  We finally said, \"So we're here to eat? Two with a little one.\"  She almost seemed confused and said, \"I'll have to see where we're at.\" Okay?? So she leaves, we wait, she comes back and tells us she'll help us in a bit. Okay... Another lady then come up and says that they have a table for us.  Okay!  We walk in and the place is empty with the exception of one couple at a table inside and one couple at a table"}
{"text":"Wonderful location, inventive menu, and great river views. Worth the trip, especially with all of the art and shopping opportunities in cute Paoli."}
{"text":"Such a rude reception at this place while visiting from our of town.  The lady (I'm assuming shes the hostess) who greeted us said \"would've been nice to get a phone call in advance\" when we asked for a table for 4 adults and 3 kids.  But really, it was the dirty look she gave us and the tone of her voice.  We didn't stick around -- life is too short to deal with bitter people unnecessarily .  

Don't give them your business unless you enjoy rude service."}
{"text":"Very cool modern cafe that you wouldn't expect to find out in the small village of Paoli. The patio overlooking the river really tops it off.

Solid menu for lunch - the soup was a great autumn-warmer: curry-squash. They have a few different types of sandwiches, which were definitely above average. Desserts were top notch, and the bottled beer selection entertained.

What a great little place, just a tad more expensive than I would have liked."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find... it can be confusing as you go into the art gallery and then hook a left.  You go by the counter and then there is a door that you enter to get to the cafe.  

The food is worth the drive from madison.  It really blew me away.  It was all fresh ingredients and put together in a way that I had never seen before.  The chef is really creative and knows how to pair flavors together.  The serving sizes are just right and I left feeling completely satisfied.  

GO!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Incredibly taste brunch in an amazing, relaxing, inspiring environment. Here's what I think....:

Food: So good! Fresh, light, tasty. I was upset when the food on my plate dwindled down. I just wanted more of it. 4-cheese & shiitake mushroom omelet and a cup of a sweet potatoe/tomato soup topped with crushed hazelnut. The waitress said it was the best soup the chef has ever made...in her opinion. It was delicious. Not the 'best ever' but delicious indeed. 

Side salad was fresh and lite. Nice addition. Good coffee too. 

Environment: Big city class in small Wisconsin town. The Cafe is a part an interesting and overpriced art museum. Definitely something nice to graze through before/after brunch. And if you have an extra $4000 lying around, buy a piece of local art. 

Food Price: $65 for 4 people (including tip). The food is well worth it. 

Service: Friendly, knowledgeable, relaxed server. Very attentive and approached table at all the right times. She did bring out a wrong order for my fiance, but we didn't complain. If we had said something, we are sure the sweetheart would have responded appropriately. 

The head chef sauntered into the room and introduced himself. Shook my hand which was a nice touch because his food was sooo good. He made his way around to the few other tables to say 'hi'. It seemed as if he know a few of the other return customers. 

The Bad: Nothing was bad enough to dissuade me from being a regular. If I had to I'd say...not good for group more than 6. A tad pricey. 

Overall: Go! Seriously. Go for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I love this place.
I have never fallen in love with a restaurant so quickly.
Creamery Cafe has an amazing view of Sugar River, which is completely breathtaking.  On top of that, everything I have had here has been absolutely amazing.  While the food isn't off the charts in terms of creativity, I believe that the chef does a fantastic job composing his flavors.  They are simple and to the point.  My favorite dish was the lemon poppyseed bread pudding that has been embedded with pecans, which add a new depth of flavor to every bite.
Every omelet I have had has been delicious as well.  They are not too oily and are accompanied by crispy rosemary potatoes.  In addition, the salads are fresh and well balanced in flavor.
I have only had brunch here so far, but would like to go to their monthly dinner sometime."}
