{"text":"Got there for a late dinner. The food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly. Extremely busy! We had to wait half n' hour for a table for the four of us. Highly recommend the chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto has been a stalwart in Markham for many years. I remember eating there 15 years ago as a young boy and being absolutely amazed at the selection and decor. I thought to myself: \"This place is like East Side Marios on steroids\".

Sadly, Frankie Tomatto no longer invokes those fond memories. Just disappointment.

I'm always a little skeptical of establishments--Italian ones--that do not in fact have Italian people in the kitchen. Even the \"executive chef\" here is not Italian. Frankie Tomatto does not do anything to alleviate these stereotypes.

Further, it was particularly busy on my visit so I parked around back. I always make it a point to observe the receiving area of restaurants because they usually are a true tell when it comes how cleanly the place is. 

Let me spare you the gory details: the back of this place is disgusting. 

Cya Frankie, it was nice knowing you."}
{"text":"I recently went here with family and was pleasantly surprised! The last time I was here was when I was a kid so I was expecting the quality and atmosphere to have deteriorated. The food was actually (for the most part) quite good and the service was on top of it. Although the food is not the *best*, it was still pretty decent for the price and was above buffet food standards. I would recommend this place for families as there are a ton of young kids around. 

Just be prepared to take a long nap after cause of all those carbs!"}
{"text":"The food is decent for a buffet, it's a bit packed so there's little privacy. There's a lot of traffic around the food so keep in mind this isn't the cleanest place. The staff is nice and the service is worthy. Try not to go when it's super busy."}
{"text":"Found a bloody band-aid inside napkin with utensils.  Walked out with a family Of 12.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Last time i was here was about 3yrs ago and i did not really want to come back.  Tonight we came as a group of 22 and i have to say food and service was much better. 

The reason it got 3 stars only is because i couldn't find a cow.  I was a little disappointed that there were no beef dishes.  I was waking around and could not find a beef dish at all.  They had chicken, pork, fish and mussels.  But no  beef!!! And no bacon dish. There was a big rib thing, but pretty sure that was pork rib and not beef rib.  They had meat balls but, can't really consider that as beef.  Lol

And MIA was Italian sausage!  There were little pieces of sausages in one of the pasta but no grilled ones.  

The desserts were average, not a lot of selection.  And considering it was an Italian place, no gelato to be found!!! What is up with that??? 

But all in all, most of the food was prepared pretty good.  Just missing the beef!

Price was pretty good, $16.99/person with an automatic 12% tip added on for large groups.

Will i come back... it will not be by choice.  I will only come back if i had too."}
{"text":"Gastly !  First the chairs are so dirty with food crumbs and the servers just sit and chat and not even bother doing their job. Food is horrendous.  My friend spat aut the ribs and the calimari was RUBBER it took me 3 minutes for me to chew. The employees don't care they will run you over with carts or walk right into you with out saying excuse me. I glimpsed at the kitchen (door was wide open) and honestly it was repulsive. On top of that I had to pay 12% tip. For what getting my drink? Really? Awful awful awful!  I went to Tim Hortons after to eat BETTER FOOD.  Actually even garbage is better."}
{"text":"I had previously come to this restaurant maybe 10 years ago. When I had originally went, the food was decent and the place seemed packed.

I went again last night with my girlfriend and I feel as if times have definitely changed here. The decor is still great and I love the Italian street setting, but aside from that the food quality and selection is lacking.

I don't usually complain about my food but I felt maybe taking their selection to the next level would help with the taste and quality. It just seems as if the cooks at Frankie Tomattos are just doing the basics of cooking and not putting any love into what they make.

My first dish was mashed potatoes, spaghetti that was half cooked (crunchy bits) with meatballs that I spooned in as an extra, very fishy smelling calamari that was ruined by the breading, and a very doughy pulled pork slice of pizza (why did it contain pineapple???). My girlfriend had some similar items including a stone cold corn on the cob, and ribs that were extremely saucy (even for a rib loving guy such as myself) and again, that was cold too.

I decided to have a salad as my second plate, the lettuce was mostly romaine hearts that were soggy that made me lose my appetite. I also picked up some potatoes (cooked good! I can't believe it) and Italian sausage that was extremely burnt and had been sitting under the heating lamps since noon.

How can you mess up dessert? It's possible here. They had an Apple Cobbler/Crisp that contained an unknown fruit that had been essentially \"gelled\", and way too much crisp on the top. Seriously, when I dug into the pan I thought it was just all flakes and nothing else. Hey, at least the ice cream was good - if it had freezer burn I would've lost it.

Again, we paid for our food and didn't demand a refund - but I won't be returning unfortunately. I feel as if there are many better buffet options out there for the money."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on Easter Sunday, a day when the early bird special wasn't available, and the food was excellent - as good as Remezzo's, and it came with salad and dessert, so it was a good deal for $25.99.

Everything tasted good - they had a large variety of pizzas, macaroni and cheese, a spaghetti bolognese and meatball bar, caesar salad, both beef and garlic pork ribs, veal and eggplant parmesan, crab cakes, roast beef, potato latkes, etc.

The desserts were great because they use real whipped cream, and the desserts aren't too sweet.  Had a cupcake, buttertart square, rice crispie square, belgian waffle with soft serve ice cream, homemade donut hole, strawberry cheesecake, and coconut macaroon.

Have been to Frankie Tomatto's for the early bird special and on Seniors day with my parents in the past, and I think it made a difference to go on a day when everybody was willing to pay full price because then they're more willing to keep the meatballs fully stocked.  And it was busy enough that the pasta stayed fresh and didn't get mushy.

It was really good today!  We enjoyed our visit very much."}
{"text":"BE AWARE OF YOUR CHECK!!!! This is the second time they do this and when caught their answer is 'oops' . The price was supposed to be 13.99, when they see a big group they increase the price without informing U hoping you don't realize... Attached pictures for prof ...TERRIBLE LOCATION go to Mandrain across the street way better !! 

They increases price by a dollar without notice, may not be much but it's significant with a big group .... Terrible terrible location"}
{"text":"I went in a friday night. They serves a special seafood buffet on friday which is roughly 25$ including taxes. 

The entrance was crowded as there were plenty of people were waiting. It did not take long for the server to find me a seat. The place was vibrant with people and energy. The food were all italian, including salads, pasta, grills, pizzas, bakery, and seafood and those were awesome. Taste wise and variety wise it was an excellent experience. I did not like the pastry section which was below par.

The servers are polite, attentive, and fast. 

This would be a great experience for anyone."}
{"text":"Good for families with lots of kids!! Join the crowd. Most of the tables are for groups of four or more with a few tables for two squeezed in between. If you are a couple trying to have a relaxing dinner and a quiet conversation and a glass of wine, fuhgetaboutit. If you hate other people's ill mannered, loud children and their parents, don't go to Frankie Tomatto's Restaurant even if the food's pretty good and the choice of wines are OK. If you do happen to drop in my advice is to eat fast and plug your ears when the boom box birthday song starts up at the next table."}
{"text":"This is my first time here after 12 years. I wasn't expecting much just mediocre food. I was pleasantly surprised! The food exceeded my expectations. Most dishes were very good, well flavoured and not too salty. The pasta dishes were excellent. What I found quite different was the buffet serving dishes were quite small which men's high turnover and they constantly refreshing with new batches. This is much better than typical buffers with the large serving trays where you don't know how long it's been out. We made reservations for our big group which I recommend. Other large parties waited a very long time.  I'll definitely be back. By the way this place way better and has much better food than Vinnie Zucchini"}
{"text":"When this place opened in the 90's it was the BEST buffet available besides Mandarin at the time. There were lots of variety, and the price is good. In fact, the staffs use to make pretty sweet coins here, but then things change. Quality dipped, quantity remained the same, and the loyal staff left for another rising star restaurant.

I actually enjoy eating here once in a while, because its not authentic, but its good value for buffet if you come after 9pm mon-thur for $13. They still have lots of variety options like: soups, salads, pizza, brushetta, shrimp, fish, potato cakes, pastas, mussels (the signature), meatballs, desserts. Good news for this place, this loyal customer has still remained with them. =) And while you enjoying your buffet, you can hear their up-beat birthday song and take a photo with 'Frankie' billboard. 

Here is my scores for this establishment:
Food: 3/5
Atmosphere: 3/5
Decor: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5

Improvements: Add some new stuff to spice up the buffet!
- Have delivery service!"}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start. I went on a Wednesday night and it was packed. The waiting area was pleasant and I can see why kids like to come here (cheesy decorations and areas for picture taking). 
I heard this place was managed by Italians and it's true Italian cooking in a buffet style..... I don't think so! It was the worst food I've had in a long time. 

From the time I put the pasta on my plate and sat down, the food was COLD (didn't sit far from the buffet mind you). The flavor was bland and the pasta all stuck together into clumps (the ravioli, shells, spaghetti). The only thing that was close to decent were the rice balls and potato wedges. 

The pizza was too doughy (looked almost raw in some areas) and there weren't any Italian seasonings! I'm not Italian, but I've had Italian in Italy and THIS my fellow yelpers is not Italian. 

We were disappointed in the quality of the food mostly. The ambiance is cute and cheesy and the service was pretty good. Our waiter was very attentive. But if I'm going to pay that much for food I'd love to leave the place full, not hungry."}
{"text":"i went a few years back and was so turned off i had to be dragged back. 
I'm happy i went. food was wayyy better then i ever remembered. Service was friendly but nothing special. There seems to be a small wait but there is a decent waiting area. Enjoy,  

p.s- great spot for birthdays"}
{"text":"I'm a biased reviewer because pasta is literally my favourite food of all time, but Frankie Tomatto is somewhere I go when I: 1) want to pig out on a lot of pasta, and 2) have cast aside all feelings of shame and self-guilt for the day. I still remember the first time I tasted Frankie's Tomatto. I was in grade school. My love for pasta was already strong back then, I remember feeling like I was in heaven. Now several years have passed and I consider myself a grown-ass adult with a pretty refined taste in things. But still, Frankie is in my heart.

Never change, Frankie.

But you only get 4 stars because you're a buffet. And I have never actually LOVED buffet food, not even at 5 star resorts. But you come pretty close.

Might I add their pizza is actually pretty decent. It's really soft, fresh, and chewy with a surprisingly generous amount of toppings.

Give Frankie a try."}
{"text":"Out of the 3 times I've come here I've found hair on my pizza twice. The kitchen staff need to wear hair nets."}
{"text":"Went to Frankie Tomatto's on wkend for a child's bday party. Quality of food has improved a lot! Pleasantly surprised food almost as good as when this buffet first opened! 

1st plate: Started off with seafood: roasted salmon,  fried calamari, calamari salad & garlic bread. Loved it! Salmon was tender & flaky. Fried calamari was crispy & NOT oily. Cold calamari salad tasted great! Not overpowered by vinaigrette. Garlic bread was nice & crispy.

2nd plate: herb roasted chicken, roasted Corn, roast beef w/ gravy, meat lasagna,  roasted peppers, slice of chicken pizza, fried or roasted herb potato medallions & rice. I found the potato medallions a bit salty. The roast beef was a little tough. Otherwise everything else here was perfectly cooked & absolutely delicious! Chicken was tender & flavorful. Corn & peppers had perfect amt of char. Lasagna had good amount of meat & cheese.  I added some pepper flakes for some zing & it was tasty & added right amt of heat. Pizza tasted delish with right amt of toppings & wasn't greasy. Rice well seasoned & wasn't mushy but light & fluffy.

3rd plate: After such a heavy plate went for much lighter fare. Got a plain pancake w/ syrup, 1 breakfast sausage & bacon, cantelope, honeydew melon, grapes, & pineapple. This is the best pancake I have tasted in a long time anywhere ever! Chef made them fresh. Light & fluffy & soo good! Sausage & bacon cooked perfectly. Fruit were fresh & sweet. No complaints whatsoever :)

4th plate: spaghetti,  beef meatballs, turkey meatballs in cream sauce, vegetarian meatballs,  chicken cacciatore  grilled veggies & rosti potatoes. Only thing I didn't like was vegan meatballs.  They were good for vegetarian meatballs but not to my liking cp to real meatballs! The beef & turkey meatballs were well seasoned & tender. Loved the sauces they were cooked in. Cacciatore tender & flavorful. Spaghetti tiny bit softer than al dente which is the way I like spaghetti! Rosti potatoes perfectly seasoned w/ nice crisp on outside & tender inside. 

5th & final plate: capuccino ice cream, bread pudding w/ caramel sauce, a biscuit, lemon cake, chocolate cake & rice crispy square w/ choc chips & marshmallows. Ice cream comes from ice cream maker. Just pull down on the lever & voila... Freshly made ice cream! Bread pudding tasted fantastic! The biscuit & cakes were all fresh & had the right textures. 

Overall I was really impressed w/ how fresh all the food was.  Almost everything was cooked & seasoned well. Very happy the food wasn't greasy or salty which is what I've experienced in other buffets. Definitely recommend everybody to try Frankie Tomatto. I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Ate here with a former co-worker who still works close by recently. She invited me, her retired friend for lunch on a Wednesday. We were not sure why there were so many people in worse shape than me there as customers, until the waiter said it was seniors day. Great deal by the way. I enjoyed the vast selection. Not all the food was to my liking but there was so much variety any fussy eater could make a great meal out of what was offered. My only complaint was the access to the restaurant. The designated Disabled parking spots were just normal sized not allowing people like myself to open the door fully to get out of the car using a cane. Many of their customers were using walkers. The newly made ramp could use a railing on one side allowing those needing to use the ramp using a cane something to hang onto while making the climb. The staff were attentive and polite. I refrained from giving them a 5 star rating over the access, otherwise this is a great place to go. Great value for your money."}
{"text":"Went their on a saturday night and the place was pretty busy. The only addition they had was the beef rib. The ribs were so hard and overly cooked that many customer, including myself, complained to the manager and they told the chef. The second plate i got there was hair on my food and that just ended my dinner. I think this place is overly priced and the food taste is not great also."}
{"text":"Went there today and was quite horrified. The food was all bland and all cold.  There is nothing worse than cold pasta. I joked that the watermelon was the best tasting dish. The rice pudding and tiramisu are kept in a non refridgerated table. One good thing was thay they had vegetarian and gluten free items. The washrooms were so dirty. Under the sink there are two HUGE bins filled of probably supplies and the bins were so disgusting and dirty. The sink had all gunk in it. I am.still.grossed out by it. Doesn't anyone clean the washroom? The waiters were all really nice and accomodating but they really do kick you out right at two hours. Also they don't do reservations at certain times."}
{"text":"The food really needs improvement.  Taste and quality are severely lacking. Salmon was dry and over cooked.  The beef was the same. The salad and pizza were the only redeeming thing about the buffet. I have to add the wait staff is very friendly and accomodating."}
{"text":"Last night was my first night there and the first thing that caught my eye is the great decor. You enter by walking under a model leaning tower of pisa and walk past many little bits of decoration that make the restaurant look great.

The food and the variety of food was average, but for the price, I wasn't expecting anything great.

I don't know if I would come back because it's a bit of a trek for me, but I would recommend this place if you are just looking to stuff yourself with lots and lots of food and are in the area."}
{"text":"Pros: Tons of pasta, pizza, etc. 

Cons: Cramped buffet area. Bland garlic bread. Limited dessert options.

Overall, okay."}
{"text":"Does this restaurant serve halal foods? Does anyone know the answer? Yelp app introduces this place as a halal buffet but i am still not sure and i am invited there in days."}
{"text":"Food poisoning..  Needless to say was an awful night and day after. Contracted food posioning from having the lunch Buffett.. Other then that awful experience food was cold bland and awful.. Will never return"}
{"text":"Went for lunch the other day and food was very bland no flavour in it at all and everything was cold except for the pasta it's definitely quantity over quality. I was expecting better from this place as I've been here few times over the years and it was a lot better but it has definitely changed. Was really surprised don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Greasy italian food at its best. Lots of selection, most of it greasy. Meatballs are good though, so worth the price of admission. 

This place has been around a long while, and has undergone some ownership change i think. I still like it. Almost gave it 4 stars, but i relented; its not quite 4 star level at this time."}
{"text":"I've been to Frankie's many times throughout my life, usually for birthday's and such. This is the first time I've been there for lunch, and it was just as fantastic as I remember.

The food was delicious - the fact that they have smaller trays means that their freshly refilled more often, and the chefs are right behind the counters, constantly cooking. I did notice that the carvery didn't have as much during lunchtime, but everything else was pretty much the same as dinner.

The service was phenomenal, especially for a buffet place like this: No prompting was required for water refills, and the servers took away finished plates at optimal times (when you go back up for food). They also had smiles on at all times and ensured that we were taken care of.

Atmosphere is cheesy Italian. It's like that for a reason: don't take the decor and high-spirited atmosphere too seriously, this place is meant to be fun and warm - which it is to all degrees.

All-in-all, if you want an interactive experience, and some tasty, filling eats, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Recent changes to their hours have really upset me. After much deliberation I have decided to keep their 3-star rating, since their customer service was kind enough to e-mail me back after I complained. But I'm still unhappy with the choice. Formerly they were open until 11 on weekends, with a discounted price available in the last hour. This was a great way for them to clean out the leftover food, and for us it was a great way to end the day since we are usually too busy to have dinner at \"normal\" times. Sadly as of Jan 2013 they removed the discount and close an hour earlier. RIP Frankie Late Nite."}
{"text":"Do not I say do not bother dropping in on a weekend. I don't know how they filter their customers at the front but we've waited longer then we needed to get a table. We've witnessed customer after customer where they did not even have a reservation (hint hint we were sitting right next to the hostess stand) so it's pretty obvious that they were biased to us. Anyways, don't bother wasting your time since you will be \"profiled\"."}
{"text":"We had a company holiday party here for around 40+ people (plus a few kids). We were put in a small room at the back but still had to share it with a table of 10+ people. We played group games and handed out awards and I guess we were being too \"loud\" because the other table called the manager and complained. The manager didn't look too happy and rudely told us that we were making too much noise and that we weren't allowed to continue in our festivities at \"HIS\" restaurant and that we had to sit down. I mean I can understand that such a large group could be disruptive to others who are trying to enjoy their dinner, but the manager could've just told us nicely to be more quiet. After the table left, we were allowed to continue on with our games. Why couldn't they just have given us the whole room?  

If you're thinking about holding a corporate party here, I wouldn't recommend it. Even though their website encourages booking holiday parties there. 

Other than that, the food is buffet style so you can't expect it to be fantastic since it is cooked in large batches, but they offer a lot of variety and it isn't the worst. They renovated some parts, but it still looks relatively the same, with the tacky dusty cheap decor. The service from the waitresses was otherwise pretty good. They were nice and we were served promptly. Parking there can be horrible if it's busy. 

Would I come back? Probably not any time soon, and definitely not with a large group."}
{"text":"Ok for Italian buffet. A little bit of everything for everyone. Would return only if i had a large party or something bit definitely not just for two."}
{"text":"Quick, convenient, and good service!

Great price for lunch. Nice atmosphere, a little cheesy, but still nice. They have a couple of decent dishes, but most of it what you would expect for a $14 lunch buffet. Go for the whole meats, rotisserie chicken, baked salmon, the garlic bread, salads, the pizza that isn't pepperoni or cheese (pizza crust was fairly good actually, but the sauce sucked), chicken parm was great, lasagna, ravioli, and gnocchi were all great. Everything else was either average or just bad.

I give them 4 stars despite the bad food review because the price and convenience were hard to beat and the service made up for a lot of lost points. Everyone was very helpful and nice!"}
{"text":"Went here on a friday night

it was $20.99 a person, two people came up to $47, not including tips or drinks

The outside is gorgeous, very creative and eyecatching. The inside is creative and themed as well, tables are a bit close. 

The chairs are wooden chairs :(

There's such a wide variety, everything tasted good, but nothing fantastic.

I also wouldn't say it's authentic either

Frankie's meatballs were good, cheese ravioli was good, chicken paremesan tasted like chicken nuggets, but still good.

Such a small variety of fruit and they put the unlabelled ketchup beside the fruits.

Stations were a bit dirty, saw them put garlic bread from a bag into the oven, pizza tastes like american pizza, saw the girl take out cream puffs from a bag. So i know a few things aren't fresh.

I was impressed at their rottisorie chicken, they stack like 10 chickens and let it spin. Very juicy


Overall, i would come back for special occasions, or for lunch ($11.99)

-decor 5/5
-food 3.5/5
-service 4/5

overall 3.5/5


p.s expect a lot of kids............."}
{"text":"This place is generally pretty decent, especially on Monday's because kids eat for 2 bucks, but my last visit might be my last. I went on a Thursday night, but the food was quite awful, and I'm being nice by just saying it was awful as opposed to it tasting like SxxT. Many of the pasta sauces were watery and many of the stations had food that was burnt. I wanted to ask many of the cooks if they'd eat burnt food. If you wouldn't eat it, why would you serve it to customers? I mean really, burnt zuchinni and mushrooms.....or wait, maybe it was Cajun crusted veggies....lol, no really, awful. It's time to look for a real Italian resto"}
{"text":"Was here on Dec 30, 2015 for my husbands bday.  We were seated right away when we arrived at 5:10pm for dinner.  When I called to make reservations I requested a high chair.  It wasn't at the table when we arrived.  So we had to wait for that.

The food selection was limited as it was a weekday.  The food we ate were average.  My kids enjoyed the pasta.  There was a good selection of food for younger kids.  They also liked the soft service ice cream.

Only complain was that when the bill came they charged my 2 year old the kids price.  Which is $9.  I clearly told them when I made reservations that it's for 2 adults, 1 kid, and 1 toddler.  She should of been charged $1.99.  So we had to wait again to get the bill adjusted.  

Also I told the waitress that I wanted the birthday package for my husband.  Towards the end of the meal  she asked me if we wanted the birthday package.  So the surprise was kinda ruined.  Other then that everything was fine. 

We will be going back again."}
{"text":"I love this place. One of my favourite buffets in GTA . I go there at least 2 times a year.  Love the decore and theme. The food is of good quality and totally worth the money you pay.
Learning Italian language in the washroom is one of the highlights of this restaurants which I always find it funny and entertaining."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: I am a big pasta lover.  I love authentic Italian pasta and I also enjoy fake American (East Side Mario) type pastas.  But Frankie Tomatto's left MUCH to be desired.  I made an effort to find something I liked.  I sampled a little bit of everything and I was incredibly disappointed.  EVERYTHING was bland and textures were big soppy messes. I couldn't finish a single place without cringing. Only the salmon was of passable quality.  I don't understand what happened since I came to Frankie's 4 years ago.  From the watered down Italian Wedding soup to the roast beef, everything was absolutely horrid.  I felt SO bad for leaving most of my meal left on the plate. For the price of $21 a head, there is absolutely NO way I would return. You get better quality at a mall food court. I am still reeling from shock at the poor quality of the food.

Facility: Very noisy, lots of kids and people celebrating birthdays.  It's hard to hold a conversation because of the noise level.  Amidst all this, they have TVs on showing sports. Decor was very tacky, lots of stereotypical \"Italian\" things.  I felt offended for how tasteless it all was. Parking was PACKED, I still don't understand why...

Service: The only redeeming quality of this establishment is the half-decent service.  Waiters were attentive and active.  They were always moving, singing, smiling, and our dirty plates were always collected promptly.  My husband and I never had an empty drink. I am so disappointed in the food so I feel very sorry for the great staff that works there.

Overall: Safe to say, we would never come back."}
{"text":"We are a fairly picky family with what we eat and this was our first time here, we came for lunch and we were pleasantly surprised at not only the quality but quantity of food.  I really enjoyed the Salmon and other entrees but the deserts could use some major improvement.

Definitely found a new favourite spot!"}
{"text":"Mega buffet, Italian style! Don't let the fake leaning tower of Pisa in front of this joint sway you, this is Canada. \"

\"Just five of you, eh?\" said the waiter.
\"Eh?\", this was the second time I heard it on our Canadian adventure.  

The mister and I came here for brunch as our last meal in the outskirts of Toronto. My godson, and his mom and dad brought us here. Not bad for brunch, 15.99 per person including your choice of soda and coffee/tea. This is about quantity not quality. Stations of pizza, pasta, seafood, salads, desserts, and roasted meats.

The food stations are organized and always attended. I opted for salads, fried calamari, and the brunch items, eggs benedict. My godson gawked at me for having eggs, but I explained to him in America, we have eggs for brunch not steamed mussels, pepperoni pizzas, and BBQ ribs. I was watching what I ate here. 

This place was packed and busy everywhere. It's family time here and your place to eat your heart for anything almost Italian. To my surprise, you can learn Italian in the restrooms. When I was in a stall, I heard a lady saying the numbers in italian. It turns out, it was an Italian lesson replaying over the speakers. So if you are doing No.1 or No. 2 or vomiting, you'll come out saying, uno, due, tre.... Why go to Pisa, when you can come here, Frankie Tomatto's?Eh?"}
{"text":"I remember going to this buffet several years ago and it was good back then.  Anyway, I was here on Monday during March break week.  It was quite busy with a lot of kids and yes they jacked up the price for kids.  Its usually $2 for kids but on March break it's $7.  I was hoping the food would be as good as I remembered it but found it just ok and most of it was salty.  Not as much variety as it used to be either.  I did like their pizza though.  I think kids would enjoy their food more than adults."}
{"text":"One of the best Buffet places in the city.
Italian cuisine mainly but the options are plenty. It is always crowded.
The dessert options are endless.
They also have halal rotisserie chicken which is rare in buffet places.
Lots of meatball and pasta options. You will not get bored with the quantity and variety of options. The staff are also very friendly."}
{"text":"Arrived with a large crowd but were served promptly. Excellent service,food was great with so many choices. Staff very pleasant and accommodating in every way. Loved the decor. Looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Frankie's last night.  The staff was super friendly and our waiter was great!  However a Manager was walking around with a very loud communication device and it was annoying as hell.  The food was just OK.   Allot of it was very dry i.e. the salmon.  Deserts were awful, except for the ice cream.  Will not be returning in the very near future."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times throughout several years and the quality has always been average at best imo. 

They are generally quick to sit you down, but you should always reserve in advance. 

Quality italian food is what you'll find here, from different topping pizzas, to seafood, to lasagna they fill those cravings. 

If the drive isnt too far for you, definitley take some time to try it out."}
{"text":"Been wanting to go here for some time, well today was my birthday, so I took  myself. I wanted some lasagna, knew I could get it here, and other stuff as well, so packed the family into the car, fresh from 'The Force Awakens' and went to dine, all you can eat styles.

Arriving at 5:30 on a Monday, we were whisked immediately to a table, no waiting. Did not know what to expect as its a Monday of the Christmas holidays, bit it seemed we arrived at the right time, as when we were leaving at 7pm, there was a wait taking place for tables. 

I broke my meal out over four course, and still bypassed two stations. 

Began with the salads. A healthy and hearty selection. Filled my plate with chilled shrimp, calamari, artichoke salad, mandarin salad, beet salad, a touch of pasta salad and focaccia. Everything was flavourful, I went back for a second serving of beets and shrimp. The second time, trying a chipolte sauce with the shrimp. There were a few leaf salads, caeser, mixed greens, etc  but I passed on them. 

Next I hit up the seafood and the 'grilled' section. This was the weakest link for me, the fried calamari was bland, thankfully I only take smaller amounts, so the few I ate were tolerable, but has I stacked a plate, I would have been wasting food likely disposing of it. From the grilled section I grabbed some sausage. It was chopped into bits, so I had about half of one, it was fresh, hot and not too fatty. Also available were grilled salmon, fried fish, potatoes, some grilled veggies. 

I made my way to the pasta section next, for what I came for, Lasagna. And whatever else may tickle my  fancy. Here I snagged some cheese tortellini, crab ravioli, beef meatballs, beef and turkey meatballs and lasagna. The lasagna was pretty delicious, but overly cheesy.  Mounds of mozzarella. Some may like it like that, I'm pretty sure it should not intentionally be like this, but I found myself scraping back cheese to enjoy it further. Adequate amounts of ground beef in a decent sauce. Buffet 101, nothing overly special, but aside from the cheese, not disappointed. The ravioli and tortellini same thing buffet 101, but the crab ravioli was a pleasant surprise to find. The meatballs were very nice, the mixed ones were larger, and neither tasted like there was 'filler' all beef or all beef/turkey. They were available in a selection of sauces. I stuck to the red sauces. There were at least half a dozen pasta options. Gnocchi, the ones I mentioned, rosee, Alfredo, vegetarian and gluten free options. Something for everyone it seemed.

I passed on the parmigiana station where I saw eggplant, chicken parma being served up, and the rotisserie station where chicken and turkey were being offered.

And finally, I rolled my stuffed self to the desert section where a selection of pastries was available, along side chocolate pudding & tapioca. As well they have gluten free options available and sugar free as well 

I returned to the table to soon be surrounded by some staff who gave me a crown, a tomato balloon, sang me a birthday song, and took my photo with a wooden cut out of Frankie Tomatto. As well as provided me with a flaming chocolate cupcake. 

All in all a fun time, a decent meal and a decent experience. Definitely will return to here within the next year for another experience."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for many years. The food isn't quite as good as it was in the past, but you'll still get a tasty meal when you're feeling gluttonous. The price is a bit high for what you get. Service was a bit slow too. It's an average buffet for above average price."}
{"text":"Finally after my cousins hype about this place brought me here. Although it is a little far from home but worth the drive. Also as we walked in around 8:15 pm on a Saturday night, the waiting period was 30-40 mins but it ended up being an hour. For me that's way too long but it was so worth it. Firstly this place is huge with such a huge selection of food (buffet) and seatings. The decor is set up with a feel of Italy along with the awesome Italian food. They have countless pastas, I didn't get to try everything since there was just so much. I recommend trying this place if you want a good quality buffet for $25 on a Saturday night. I will definitely be coming back. The service is amazing but the dessert section is the only thing I would suggest to prove on."}
{"text":"Overwhelming in its options, this buffet is amazing!  The pastas are fresh and al dente, the grilled meats are tender, and the meatballs are lovely.  Save room for the bread pudding with toffee sauce, and the strawberry soft serve ice cream (tastes like a daquiri!)"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. I went for the early bird special on a Tuesday. 

The food was ok. I rarely fill up on pizza at an AYCE but it was one of the better choices there. The fried fish was decent and the bolognese sauce and lasagna were pretty good as well. 

It was my son's birthday and the staff made him feel pretty special.

Just double check your bill. My kids were over charged."}
{"text":"Pros: The buffet is most popular, as there are numerous options to choose from. Good spot for kids with respect to food options and general interior decor.

Cons: Overly busy most of the time (sometimes hard to find parking in their lot too). Food quality to price ratio is... generally okay for the post part.

Been coming to Frankie Tomatto's for years now and it's usually consistent with respect to both quality of food and overall experience. Typically there's a lot of people, a lot of food, and a lot of noise.

Would I come back? On my own, maybe. Usually I make the trip here once in a while as a part of a social gathering."}
{"text":"Goddamn it I love this place. Every time I come home from school in the US my parents take me here. I'm 20 freaking years old and I still love it.

No, it's not going to be gourmet Italian food. If you want that, hop on a plane to Italy or shell out $200 or so at some fancy place downtown.

SUMMARY
What you do get here is lots of good, solid, yummy food and good service in a nicely decorated place. There's really nothing you could complain about for the price.

LOCATION/VENUE SIZE
Yes, it's kind of in the middle of nowhere. But our house is a 5 minute drive away. And it's probably here for the same reason that our house is - property prices are cheaper out here, which is why this place is huge and never seems to run out of tables. Or parking. +2 brownie points.

FOOD
Selection of food is quite large. Everything is kept very warm and never seems to run out, even though batch sizes are small and fresh.

Some will call the food bland and low-quality, some will love the stuff. It all depends on your taste buds, what you grew up with, how picky you are. My inner foodie loves sitting down at some expensive restaurant and shelling out $80 for a tiny portion of some exotic sea-cucumber stuffed truffle-oiled tortellini in an over-sized plate. But our family came here and built a life out of nothing just like most of the immigrants in this area, and sometimes all my taste buds want is a nice hearty homestyle meal. That's what you come to this place for. I don't know about you but I find the middle class-ness of it all very charming and comforting. It's a grounded place. There's no pretense here.

SERVICE
Have never experienced bad service here. Waiters are mostly students or local area working immigrants. They are polite, helpful, and good at their jobs. We always feel like they deserve to be tipped well.

DECOR
The outside has this large leaning-tower thing - some might find it tacky, as a kid I thought it was super cool, haha. There's statues and some cutouts of Roman figures. Inside is actually much nicer than you might expect for an AYCE buffet out in Markham: the place is huge but divided up into little passages and enclaves so it doesn't feel massive. Walls have a neat plaster effect and there are all kinds of interesting items scattered around such as statues, trees, plaster busts, paintings, etc. There's even a wall of wine bottles. Again, some might find it tacky, but I thought it was all very well-coordinated - and as a kid I thought it was the coolest place. Screw the haters.

OTHER
Bathrooms are big and clean. They also play a tape in the bathroom that teaches you Italian verbs, which I thought was neat.

The few times that we've had to wait here, we arrived right in the middle of the dinner rush and even then only waited about 10 minutes.

The clientele will be mostly middle-class families with their kids, occasionally a bunch of teenagers doing a birthday thing, etc. Staff will gather around and sing a birthday song. Sometimes a guy walks around with an accordion (he's not bad either). We've never seen any of the shows that they put on, but during normal hours it's just a nice a meal with lots of buzz in the background.

Just give it a try - if you hate it, you'll only lose anywhere between $14 - $25 depending on the time of day that you came, and you'll definitely walk out full. But I don't think you're going to hate it at all :)"}
{"text":"Food was really quite good today.
Lunch was a decent price with lots of dishes to satisfy everyone.
Fresh fruit and good salad options .
Wil be back soon"}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times. The variety is average, consisting mostly of Italian food. However, food quality is fairly decent. It doesn't taste like they rushed the cooking, as is the case with many of the buffets I've visited previously. And the service is great."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a buffet that's non-Chinese, this is the place to be.

They have made some changes over the last couple of years and the quality & choices of the food is far better than before. 

Lots of choices from salads, pastas, meats, veggies, seafood, and of course pizzas. They can even make you a gluten-free pizza and have other gluten-free foods as well, if you are looking for that.The dessert station is missing some real Italian favourites such as cannoli's. 

Staff is generally very accommodating and helpful.

On the weekends, they don't make reservations during certain times which makes no sense to me but that is their business model."}
{"text":"Again, I have to remind these other \"critics\" below me that obviously, we are not in Italy. We are in Toronto. So don't be complaining and saying that this shit is not authentic, NO DUH! And let me remind you, you're not going to some swanky restaurant here. It's a BUFFET restaurant, and you're paying only $25 give or take! It's not like we are in Salerno, Venice or Florence or something, then maybe if we were, that's when you should complain.

For an all you can eat restaurant, it's actually not bad. It is not authentic, but its good, I've tasted better but it's still good. If you're really hungry and are down for some fake Italian food, then go here. I don't think this place is THE BEST, but I always end up leaving feeling I am gonna explode with the amount of semi-decent food that I stuff in my mouth and enjoy it with the people that I spend my time here with - which makes it good for me.

So to others out there who would want to try this place? I say try it. If you're hungry and like I said, down for some pseudo-Italian food, then this place is for you. Plus its good for groups!"}
{"text":"OK this is place is huge and has lots of verity don't get me wrong but for and \"Italian\" food place it falls flat. 

There is barely any flavor in the food, and most of it is either over cooked or very oily.

I was so disappointed. It was my first time and it came recommended so I came her on a double date.

Both parties left not feeling satisfied. 

This is suppose to be an Italian experience, where are all the spices!!!???!!! If you like bland food because spices are to much for you this is your new favorite place to be... The only good thing I found we the pizza. Surprisingly is was nice. I wish they would use the tomato sauce on the pizza on the pasta too. 

They have a lot of desserts and a few sugar free as well.

This places is a toss up for me, but some people might really like it so I wont completely pass it off."}
{"text":"Great place with affordable pricing. Interior is stylish and eclectic, designed to be very Italian. Food isn't very healthy unfortunately but it tastes really good. Everyone knows that unhealthy food is the most delicious food lol. It terms of locations I would not say it's the most convenient just because it's pretty far from any ttc stops but there is no problem if you have a car. I work in this area, so for those who work somewhere around there - it's the best place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Have been here few times throughout the years and food is not too bad, the variety is quite large for a reasonable price. They have early bird special, half price senior on Wednesday, seafood Friday and so on, check their website for deals. I would suggest to go early to avoid line up, they can get very busy at rush hour, and I've seen tour buses of people go there to eat."}
{"text":"Great Italian buffet styled restaurant. Adept for a family orientated birthday for kids or older adults. Birthday costumers get a free picture, balloon, and cake with candle. Also the birthday person can spin a wheel for prizes. One of these prizes is 'a chance to win a trip to Italy for 2.' Not that it said 'a chance,' if you wheel lands on it your name is entered in  a draw. The food here has great variety, namely in the meat and heavy carbs. Surprising there was a wide selection of breakfast items at lunch. Interior is very authentic in the Italian design and has many opportunities for pictures. All in all this place is great place for kids and seniors, teenagers and young adults may find this place too childish. Yet a great place nonetheless!"}
{"text":"Been here many times over the years. They removed the dine 3 get 1 free (WHY). Meh food. Decent service. Fixes the carbs craving. Sadly, last time I went I got really sick from this place (ate something wrong/not cooked properly).

Ah will not be returning. Do not feel like getting sick again and prices are getting redic."}
{"text":"The last time I was here was about 5 years ago and I remembered loving the food here, after coming back I feel like the quality of the food went down a lot.

The selection hasn't changed much with your typical pasta dishes, seafood, salad bar, carved meats and desserts but it didn't taste the same as before. Some of the vegetables were burnt, my friend found a hair in her food and the spaghetti was way over cooked. Some dishes were still good, like their mussels cooked in tomato sauce, some pizzas and their tiramisu. Wouldn't say it's worth the $25.99 for Friday dinner.

The service was great though! The wait staff was very accommodating as we had a large party and they moved the tables around for us."}
{"text":"It was alright for a buffet. A bit crowded. Lots of food selection with a few tasty choices."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, staff. 
Loved the variety of food as well.
It can get busy.
Good place for a group of friends or even by yourself. 

If you have friends and families coming to visit and you want to go somewhere to eat some good, affordable food. This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"$17 for some of the best Italian food I have had in the GTA? YES PLEASE!

Last night was my first trip to this buffet but it won't be my last. The food was delightful and the staff were kind and accommodating. I am a vegetarian and was very satisfied with my options (many salads, several types of pizza, several types of pasta, potatoes, vegetarian meatballs, deserts, etc.). My meat loving boyfriend also enjoyed his meal. We have been to many expensive Italian restaurants searching for good Italian food, and this place manages to rival them! 

The decor was fun and the place was full of parties, it's not the place for a romantic date, but the atmosphere is great for a night out with friends and family. 

We will be back."}
{"text":"There is a large variety of food to choose from.  I just love it.  I love the service and the scenery is nice too!  The seafood soup is my favorite.  Yum.

I love taking people who have never  been here before on their birthday because for a small fee, you can arrange a group of people to sing the birthday celebrate a Happy Birthday with music, a treat, a picture and a prize before you leave!"}
{"text":"Very good, the friday night dinner was amazing. Tons of options, seafood, lots of beef options, dessert was also good. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here a few times a few years back and really liked it here. But coming here now, the price went up and the food quality isn't as good. It's now $14.99 for an adult lunch on Monday-Thursday. 

We were seated in one of the rooms furthest away from the food and were the only ones in the room. The view was a wall. We sat down, but noticed that water was dripping down from the ceiling on us...so we asked to switch and the server did so immediately and apologized. We were then seated closer to the food area. Here, there were quite a few flies flying around our table.

The place was still nicely decorated with the many different sections like seafood, salads, pastas, ice cream parlour, etc. It is very cute as you feel like you're walking in the streets of Italy. The seating was also nicely decorated having each room different. I sat somewhere like in a cave.

The selection of pastas included pesto, beef and vegetarian lasagna, basil and sun-dried tomato fettuccine, and seafood linguine, etc. There was roasted chicken and lots of calamari and mussels. There was a salad section, a seafood section, a soup section, fruits, desserts, and an ice cream parlour. 

The kale salad with the raspberry vinaigrette was good. The cappuccino soft serve was light and refreshing but the mango soft serve was too sweet. It tasted like it was made of mango puree or syrup. The waffles were freshly made, you can taste the egg flavour and it was dense. I also enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake - it wasn't too sweet, but the crust was thick and the filling was cheesy. 

I did notice that they no longer have the pork ribs that I would get every time I went. It was a bit disappointing. The minestrone soup was also too sour. 

I'd say from the time I was there until I left, about six tables were celebrating birthdays. The service was good, but the food was nothing spectacular. It is a nice touristy place, but not very worth it this time around."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Imagine it and you will find it. All-you-can-eat Italian  buffet at it's best. The food was fresh and tasty and I left filled to the gills. 

Staff was very friendly and unintusive. Very helpful and quick to clear our used up plates.

Place is clean and the 'Market Area' is visually appealing. Transport yourself to the Old Country. Comes complete with a leaning tower of Piza.

The price is great too! Comes with my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has been around for so long. 

First of all, the lay out is confusing. Secondly, the food is mediocre and the selection is limited especially the desserts (they were horrible as were the fruits - fruit flies everywhere!)

The only thing nice I have to say was that the staff was very friendly and helpful. 

Can't justify the price. I came back after 10 years. Maybe I'll give it another shot in 10 years if this place is still around."}
{"text":"If you like noise, greasy mediocre food and a bit of a circus then you will like this place. Personally, I don't. I've been here a few times only because friends seem to like it and I'm not sure why but I like them, so I go (see, I can be a nice guy).
Don't go here if you don't like children, they are everywhere!"}
{"text":"Great place for groups now only if they took reservations on Sundays between 5 and 7. 

The one thing is the menu rarely changes so you could go today after not going a year and the food selection will be the same"}
{"text":"Haven't been this restaurant for a while. I went there last week and it did not disappoint me. I must say there do not have a lot of choices but the food is good. 

I will recommend this place for people who are looking for a place for gathering events."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the years and it's decent.  It's a good place to go with a large group of people, but it gets crazy busy.  

The prices are fair and the service seems to be friendly most of time.  The food is above average for buffets.  The salmon is one of my favorites here.  

However, the dessert table isn't anything special but 4 plates later I don't need dessert."}
{"text":"Great variety of Italian food for a fixed price.  Enjoyed the food.  Waiter was very helpful."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times when I worked in Markham and I recently took a picky friend there for her birthday. I was happy to see nothing changed!

It's an all you can eat Italian buffet; hope you're hungry! They have everything from pasta to pizza to bruschetta to roasted veggies to soup. Their calamari is the best I've ever had. There is a large variety of salads and vegetarian food; the eggplant parmesan might be my favourite thing there!

The service is good, clearing the plates quickly. The birthday celebration is intense; very loud!! My friend didn't want the singing, she just wanted the tomato balloon. 

Price is reasonable. I wish there was one closer!"}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place has been open for at least 20 years .  You are not going to get truly authentic Italian cuisine but for the price and selection, you will find something you like.  Great for groups and parties. Nice atmosphere and may get a traveling accordion player on certain nights."}
{"text":"The food is still mediocre, but way better than most buffet. But the reason why I want to give a 5 star this time is because of their service. First of all the waiter was a sweetheart, he noticed I drank a lot of water, he never failed to fill up my cup and gave me a large cup as well. I know this might seem so stupid, but so many waiter/waitresses don't do this in my experience! And I don't like eating cheese, so when my mom asked the chef to make a pizza without any cheese or meat she did it without any hesitation and was so super nice! The pizza was great tasted delicious! This act made me really really happy!"}
{"text":"First 5 minutes: we came in with a reservation for 18 at 7pm. Arrived 5 minutes earlier and were told we could not be seated yet. That's fine I understand there is wait time involved. 20 minutes later the waitress still has not seated us yet. We were missing 2-3 people and were told we would not be seated until everyone was here. My understanding was that with such a big party, if majority was here should they not seat them first? The waitress was unbelievably rude, raised her eyebrows, starred at all of us with her dirty cut eye and said Just stand on the side and wait..no Please no thank you. yes of course... With 16 people here we will just stand at your door and wait. Unbelievable. Never mind the food... Service already deserves -10 stars. Woah. Never coming back again."}
{"text":"Im pasta and pizza lover . So i love this place . Food is great and just the restaurant by it self is nice . Always happy to go there . :)"}
{"text":"Have been here three times for lunch. 
To sum up: good variety, food definitely worth the price (16.99) 
Apparently some people come here for birthday. The staff do try to make atmosphere for the birthday boy/girl or man/woman... but it does end up a bit awkward for other people around like the inconsistent drums... the try-hard birthday song... not being mean just saying the fact loool. The environment is 2.5/5
The food is good for the price again but it is not amazing obviously.. and very oily... i ended up chunking bunch of Cesar salad which is pretty good loool 
I'd say it's a good place to visit once or twice a year but if you want a better environment/ higher quality food, hmm think twice :)"}
{"text":"Ewww, once and never again. I was invited to this place and I didn't know it's all you can eat.
(Note: I have a low opinion of all you can eat places). They have a very large selection of food BUT that comes for a price which is low quality. I tried a variety of their dishes and most of it tasted like canned or frozen food. Terrible. 
There may be a few things that are eatable but I didn't find them.

The price was cheap and yeah what do you expect to get for it?

I have no urge to go back there. A nightmare for a gourmet."}
{"text":"First time dining here with a group of friends on a Saturday night.  Huge dinner crowd so we were given a buzzer.  After a 45 mins. wait, we were seated.  Ambiance is very family-friendly with decor hinting of an Italian/Mediterranean feel.  Being health self-conscious, I had googled the menu ahead of time to get a feel for what to stick to.  I mainly filled up on mussels (good, always refilled), salmon (avoided dry batch, happy with moist one), grilled zucchini and bell peppers (very nice) and salad (decent salad bar).  Tried my best to stay away (who was I kidding?!) but sampled a variety of pasta...nice selection.  Favourite was probably gnocchi.  Hubby said the pulled pork sandwich, garlic bread, ribs and pizza were good...I took his word for it.  Nice desserts selection as well.  Fav were definitely the bread pudding (warm, nutty and drizzled homemade caramel sauce, yum!) and eclairs (lucky if you dig into a fresh batch, messy if after everyone's mangles the whipped cream!).  

Overall, I wasn't too fond of idea of an AYCE buffet featuring carb city in the form of pasta, pizza, garlic bread and meats but I was able to stay relatively on track with my diet, albeit some indulgences.  Only complaint was that the plates ran out often, leaving patrons to scramble for some or hesitantly grab the newly refilled plates that were still wet.  I would go back here, although maybe limit it to 1-2x/year."}
{"text":"always a hit for guests from other countries! 
I always enjoy their calamaris 
would be nice if they renovate.."}
{"text":"I remembered going to Frankie Tomatto's when I was a kid. What I recall was the atmosphere as the place was decorated very uniquely. I went to Frankie's with my kids and husband. We went on a Monday where kids eat for half the cost. I figured you couldn't go wrong. The price was good, but we were not overly impressed with any of the food. Everything was just ok. There was unfortunately not an item, that I felt I needed to get more of or enjoyed greatly. I believe everyone at our table felt the same way. I would rather pay $20 more, and go to an all you can eat Japanese buffet instead for example (we've been to many great ones). Even though the price was good for 4 people (tax and tip about $60), I don't think we will be going back. Despite the food, the service (our waiter) was great. He was very pleasant, friendly and attentive. We appreciated that, and wrote a very positive comment card for him!"}
{"text":"I only ever come here in large groups or occasions, and every time I've been here I've always enjoyed the selection of the food. The restaurant is spacious and accommodates large and small groups well, and the waiting area before getting seated is comfortable (tall couches! Yas). Their food isn't the most authentic or delicious thing of life (as I've tried really, really good Italian food, and homemade too) but it is enough to satisfy my palate and hunger. Came here most recently on Friday for the early bird 5-7pm special with the staff at work as our final debrief dinner. We had our own room/space there, and everyone had a good time. P.S. Rice pudding & linguine on point. :)"}
{"text":"Not authentic Italian food. Pizza, pasta north America style. Tiramisu was really nice. No gelato, 4 types of ice creams, vanilla, mango, chocolate, cappuccino. Different penne, spaghetti and lasagnas. 

Middle class clients, mainly families, very large place, service was average.

Price is acceptable for a buffet."}
{"text":"For a buffet, I find the food more than adequate! They have many categories of food and they were all A-OK! Nothing really disappointed but nothing really blew my mind either. And that's perfectly acceptable for a buffet style restaurant at this price range. We came for lunch. It's $16 pre tax (~$20 after tax and tip). For those who gave negative reviews, I don't know what you were expecting. Or maybe it was just the luck of the draw? It's only my first visit and it's good enough to warrant a second.

For example, the pizzas actually have toppings. The ribs have a decent amount of meat on it (it's still boney but acceptable). The pasta are pretty flavorful (though they were loaded with cheese mostly). Deserts are never bad. Their calamari rings are not all batter. Neither are their fish. 

What DOES make this place stand out as a buffet is that it's Italian food. Most buffets are Chinese, Indian, or Sushi. Plus the decor is nicer. It's perfect as a corporate celebration place or a friend's birthday party."}
{"text":"I love Italian food so much especially pizza and pasta so dining at Frankie Tomatto's was like heaven for me. The pizza was very tasty, even the vegetable pizza doesn't taste like vegetable, it tasted like real pizza!  And also there's a lot of varieties of pasta. I tried a lil bit of everything from their pastas but the one that I really like was the white sauce with meatballs, very delicious! There were also chicken, beef, etc. but I didn't get the chance to try it. There was only a little room for dessert so I didn't get to try a lot but the one i tried was the Fruit Crumble then I put Toffee Sauce on top, it was the best! Their Mango Ice Cream was good too, it tasted like gelato. The service was good and the ambience of the place was really nice and fancy. It looks small on the outside but very spacious inside."}
{"text":"Ça fait longtemps que j'étais allé là-bas. Le restaurant est bien rénové. Plusieurs petites salles qui fait en sorte que c'est moins bruyant que mon souvenir avant la rénovation.  Le décor est super beau à l'Italienne. Le buffet est pas mal complet avec les pâtes, les pizzas, les viandes, les desserts, les salades, le super beau pain gigantesque et coupé en belle portion. Le vendredi soir c'est le spécial des fruits de mer.  J'ai par contre pas été impressionné des pattes de crabes trop cuites et pas assez chaudes même en sortant de la cuisine. Il y a trois beaux choix de soupes, très bonnes. Le saumon était super bon et pas trop cuit. Le roast beef super bon aussi. Il y a un beau choix de dessert en petite portion donc on est capable de manger un mini \"cup cake\" après avoir fait le goinfre... Pour finir si ça vous tente d'apprendre quelque mot d'italien, passer par les toilettes."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 5 times back in the day. I was obsessed with this place! It was like tiny Italy to me. I love pasta, so when I came to this place, it kind of felt like I was Skrat from Ice Age.. Always looking for the acorn LOL. Anyway, this place was fantastic! Not so much the service, the food. Food was well made and kept very hot for AYCE.

I do feel like the quality has slowly declined since they first started. I remember the first time I put the food in my mouth.. A blast full of flavour and taste I couldn't even comprehend. Given my circumstance (being chinese), I never really had western food often at home. Naturally, I would think the food was exotic and different. But now that I know better, I think to myself, why would I pay so much for something I can make in a few hours or less? I do miss this place, though.

Maybe I should go back and give them another shot? 
I'd give it 4 stars, but the decline in quality means -1."}
{"text":"I'm sure that almost everyone had been to Frankie Tomatto's I mean I hear friends and people talking about enough time to know its a pretty well known place. So I decide to go and give it a try. 

Pros: 
Early Bird Specials, Arrive early to take advantage of  this special. If you get early bird food is made fresh
Enough selections to make me leave pretty bloated afterwards. 
Very nice atmosphere, The building, interior decorations really gives you an authentic Italian feel. 
Service, good from the moment I stepped in till I left the door. 

Cons: 
Food, most of the food felt really mediocre what I mean is that it isn't restaurant quality. I feel that most of these items can be home made. Where the interior design helped with the Italian feel, the food does not live up to being authentic Italian in fact it was hard to even say it was an Italian style buffet. 
I've mostly eaten Pizza, and Calamari, Salmon but for even the Early bird special I feel like trying to eat your value's worth is near impossible

As much as I hate to criticize its efforts I've expected a lot more from Frankie Tomatto
Its an unique experience that I recommend for those who have not tried. Overall I would say this is a one time a year place to go, If you have not tried it I would recommend you do just to clear up the hype and at least say I've been there, ate there, and the rest is history."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening after work with several colleagues. Super thankful we made a reservation for 6:30 cause the place was packed shortly after we were seated. If you have a large party, I highly recommend making a reservation. The restaurant was very large and sectioned into many separate dining rooms with the buffet located in the centre. It's a bit confusing if you're bad with directions, cause you might find yourself wandering around for a while before finding your table again. They have a large selection of food constantly being replenished by staff who worked visibly behind the counters. Our server was very attentive and  made sure our glasses were always full. The only down side is that the buffet area always has a lot of traffic ranging from diners being brought in to be seated, people who are getting their food, staff, and customers leaving. I would come again, but would probably choose a day between Monday through Thursday instead of the weekends to avoid the busy times."}
{"text":"Great place. Good variety of food. Great selection of pizza. Lovely sausages. Desserts were fine. Ice cream was lovely."}
{"text":"From the outside you'd think you were approaching an Italian amusement park.  Leaning Tower, La Scalla, and Florentine statuary at every turn.  Entering, the first impression is of noise and kids running around having fun, and lots of people on their feet carrying plates full of food.  That's all good as long as Frankie has the chops to back it up with real deal Italian food.  Sure is a lot of energy! 

Now, some may prefer a more sedate dinner environment, with waiters, Sinatra crooning, checkered table clothes, and empty Chianti bottles com candle holders complete with melted wax.  If that is you, don't come to Frankie Tomatto's.  This place is not that place. 

Nor, is it the place to go for quality and genuine Cuisine Italiano.  Sad to report, while there was a ton of edibles in Roman style, and you could have all you wanted, it turns out that you really don't want all that much.  The pizza is forgettable.  The pastas without much charm, nor taste, and the salads...well, let's just say they lacked charisma.  

And, then you return to the running kids and the noise factor.  

There is just too much happening on the floor, and too little in the kitchen, to make this a positive experience.  There has got to be a true authentic mom and pop Italian restaurant somewhere nearby that has been discovered by the locals, while the tourists and kid-centric families come here.  

Try to find it."}
{"text":"Love the variety of the food. They have pizza, soup, salad, fruits, different pastas etc. I love the food here. My favorite are the meatballs and the potato fritters"}
{"text":"Came here, with the kids today, because it was a PA Day. The food was good as usual, lots of variety and choices. Only bad thing was the hostesses and staff, they were as miserable as the weather."}
{"text":"YUCK!! 

I vomited after eating their food! And my friend got diarrhea... NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!  I tried a bit of everything as well as my friend so we couldn't conclude what made is sick."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place. I've gone for both lunch & dinner, & have not been disappointed at either times. If you like Italian food, you're going to LOVE all-you-can-eat pasta, ribs, pizza, and everything else. Even for lunch, they have their huge ribs available. That stuff is yummy!!! They also have an outdoor patio to eat at, which is perfect for those not-too-hot summer afternoons. They had everything that made me happy & I was happy when I left with a stomach filled up with meat & pasta."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why my family and I continue to come here. Maybe because it is one of the cheaper buffets to go to and it is kid friendly. But the food here is just not good. This is one of the only buffets that I would go to and not leave feeling like my stomach was about to burst. Maybe that is a good thing but if I'm at a buffet I want to roll out because I'm so full. 

The good: 
The decor inside is created to look like a touristy Italy place. Cute idea with leaning tower of pisa outside and the whole decoration on the inside. The service is very attentive and polite. 
They offer brunch on weekends which includes eggs and breakfast sausages. Prices for the buffet are cheaper than what you get at Dragon legend but that is because you get what you pay for.

The bad:
The food is honestly just what you pay for. We came here for brunch on Sunday and it wasn't too busy at first around 11:45 but around 12:15 it was packed. Like straight up packed. The buffet area is very small and cramped. There is not a lot of walking space especially if you have people on both sides of the buffet grabbing food. You are literally shimming like you are on the TTC. There is a lot of a variety. It's Italian food so they have meatballs and pasta, ribs, and limited seafood.

The ugly:
The limited seafood is one of the highlights here. Everyone knows it. So there is obviously a line. But the line for the seafood is ridiculous. You can be lined up back to the brunch table and stand there for at least 20 minutes. Of course you have some people cutting the line because they are just too ignorant to acknowledge a line of people waiting. The reason why the line also takes so long is because you have those greedy ass people taking two plates full of mussels leaving none for the reason of the line. So people stand there waiting for the mussels/calamari to be refilled. 
A lot of the food is also not hot. I got meatballs (after standing in line for seafood) and cut into the meatballs first when I sat back down. The inside of the meatballs were lukewarm at best. It was not warm enough for me to eat it though. 

I also question the sanitation here...because I was not feeling 100% when I got home. Just sayinggggg......"}
{"text":"2 of us came for dinner on a Saturday night around 7:30. Big crowd as expected. Was told wait maybe 30-40 min wait and given a buzzer. However, we got a table after only 15 min. Manager himself took us to our table and he was friendly, just like the reception staff.

Like many patrons and reviewers, I probably haven't been here for years, maybe 8 years. Back then I came here to try once, but didn't remember the food being great tasting. I only remember it being very dark. This time the place was very well lit and I feel safe seeing well where I'm going and seeing the foods clearly.

Overall, the quality of the food was OK. Nothing exciting and out of the world great, but not bad either.

Things I tried that tasted fine: various meatballs, rotisserie chicken, gnocchi, ravioli, eggplant parmesean, parmesean chicken, salmon, battered fish, fried calamari, caesar salad, fresh sweet fruits, rib, pulled pork sandwich

Things I wasn't a fan of: spicy clam linguini tasted ok but the noodle was soft/mushy and not al dente at all. Garlic bread was bit greasy and most cake pieces too sweet.

Servers were polite and did their jobs like taking away empty plates promptly.

Overall, the foods are good. It's not particularly great or exciting, but I feel I do get value for the price. I will come back again, when I'm in the mood for this type of foods."}
{"text":"On 13october 2012 we dined at this place. Over the past 15 years  I  have  been many times to this restaurant. Quality of food and variety of foods for vegetarians has gone down. They don't even take care to put proper signs on the dishes to differentiate their foods, as vegetarian or meat. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Good Italian buffet. Been here several times in recent weeks for birthday gatherings. Food has been fresh and the selection is pretty good. Servers have been friendly and attentive everytime we've eaten there."}
{"text":"Frankies to me means memories..

I used to go here all the time with my family when anyone had a birthday. Even held my own bday here with friends a few years ago. It's just so easy and there is something for everyone to eat. I think that's the reason each time I come, I hear the \"Frankie birthday song\" play every 5 minutes.

If you like non-authentic Italian all you can eat feasts, then there is nothing better or similar to Frankies.

Pizzas, pastas, chicken/beef/meats, soups, salads, desserts - good variety of food and lots of it.

Their lunch deal and early bird rates are very reasonable."}
{"text":"my company took us out for a corporate holiday lunch, either wise i would not ordinarily go out of my way.  Salmon was dry.  Chicken was dry. Ribs was dry.  Ham was dry.  Why is all the MEAT DRY? as for the Pasta sauce, c'mon! i know you have to cook for the masses, but try a little bit of flavour, it tasted so empty, it was missing spice and GARLIC!!!!  

Atmosphere was nice, space was great for a large party, wait staff were great, very prompt, plates were cleared in a timely fashion.  But good service doesn't make up for bad food.  

The only reason why i am giving Frankies two stars, is because my company took us to Vinnie Zucchinis last year, and Vinnie's was an abomination.  in the battle between Italian buffets, well, lets just say Vinny is somewhere in Lake Ontario wearing the cement shoes.

But truthfully, both places should be in ocean sleeping with the fishes..."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! It is so delicious, fun for birthdays, food is amazing, love love love it.

Only complaints are the service is pretty meh, and the desserts are lacking."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this restaurant for over 20 years.  It's much as I remember it.  Great service.  A wide variety of foods.  

I am not a huge fan of buffets as I find the food can be luke warm at times.  A lot of pasta (which is expected).  Meat sauce was tasty and meatballs were seasoned and very tasty.

Prices are more than what I would expect for a carb laden buffet, but there is a good variety and something here for everyone."}
{"text":"This place has changed since last time here and that was 8 yrs ago. The food looks better and taste better. Monday kids are 2 bucks. You need to reserve a table otherwise it's a long wait!"}
{"text":"Everything here looks old and worn out. Found lots of food scraps under our table, which makes me worry about the general cleanliness of the place - especially since it's a buffet and food is just laid out collecting all sorts of germs. Ignored the crab legs and seafood on ice area as I didn't feel safe eating it and they looked pretty stale anyway. Went for all the warm food. Very carb heavy, as other reviewers have stated. Pastas were greasy, not al-dente (LOL are my expectations too high?) and generally meh.

Every table seemed to have a birthday song play for them, including our party. In truth, I would not have thought about coming to this place if it were not for a friend's birthday... he really wanted the cheesy Frankie birthday song experience to fulfill some childhood dream (lol)."}
{"text":"It's suppose to be Italian food buffet, but the restaurant is made to look like street food, serious traffic jams, going to the food area are too crowded. The set up is all wrong, plus, going from food to your seat is a trick! I got kids who were seated close the the entrance you have to step up or down going and coming back from the food, do you have any idea how big of a disaster that is? kids under 6 carrying glass plates going up and down steps on a brick/paver floor god forbid one miss step and there goes the kid.  Please people BE VERY CAREFUL.  PLUS THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH $26 per head.  you can eat and enjoy fresh warm food some other place."}
{"text":"From afar it's a very impressive looking building, the closer you get the more you realise how old and worn everything is 

Went in and everything seemed very disorganised and hectic 

Got to our table and the gentleman serving was friendly and attentive 

The layout of the buffet looks wonderful and quirky, looks like a little Italian street with various food vendors I loved it! 

The space however is tight to get past some folk with your food. 

Plenty of choice however i did find the more authentic Italian dishes to be very bland in taste. 
The mussels were over cooked and tiny 
The ribs were fatty and lacked any tender meat

Positive - the rotisserie chicken was sublime and the garlic bread tasty 

Plenty of choice from the deserts however the soft scoop ice cream machines each time I went up had only 2 running, coffee and vanilla they also struggled to keep waffles topped up

I'd say the food was all in just ok 
The place looks good inside but the nasty metal chairs you have to sit on scrape horribly across the tiled flooring 

Would I go back? Nah not anytime soon if I'm honest, nothing I can't get somewhere else and tastier"}
{"text":"Came here last night w/ my buddies. The last time I came here was probably over a decade ago with my fam, so I was a bit skeptical of the quality of this buffet, but decided to yolo it.

There were only a few parking spots open, and so I was anticipating a long wait to be seated, however, there was no wait for my group of 4.

Tbh, this was one of the worst buffets that I've ever been to. It was both low quality and low variety. I only enjoyed 2 pasta dishes and their ice cream machine.  Other than that the food was pretty shit and there was very little selection.

Additionally, it's worth noting that most of the employees here are high school students (witnessed one of them prompose to each other last night lol) and so don't expect much in terms of service. Our waiter looked like he hated life - not even a \"thank you, have a nice evening\" after we paid.

Tbh, I can barely recommend this place to a family with small children. I definitely went to better buffets as a kid and would like to think that my palate would be able to discern the good buffets from the \"food\" that they serve here.

Don't let the gimmicky leaning tower of pisa on the outside fool you. Take your monies and go to spend it on ayce or a diff buffet."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Love the food and the prices are decent. I came here with a large group and had a good time except our waiter was not in the slightest way friendly or welcoming (i.e. When a few of us would say \"thank you\", he would stay silent). He also asked me (the birthday girl) if he should bring out my cake...wtf? I was never offered the birthday chant that the staff do so we had to ask for it (although he fully knew it was a birthday brunch). When we asked about the birthday chant, he looked at us and asked rudely \"oh, you want that?\" When we asked for a container or something to store the remaining cake we had left over, he said we brought the cake like that was so we have to take it back like that. A simply \"no, sorry we don't have any containers\" would've sufficed. He made no efforts to even help us come up with a solution either. If we didn't have a large group where the gratuity wasn't already  included, I would've given him a big fat ZERO for a tip. 

To sum up, I would've rated 5 stars but because the food is great but I gave 3 stars based on the service. And btw, the waiter's name is Frank (of Asian descent - just incase there's more than one Frank)."}
{"text":"This place has definitely gone down hill. Their italian wedding soup..was made with old meatballs with old rice. Was definitely not very appetizing. Their seafood chowder was so thick and smelled weird.

Looks like they've cut corners in food quality.. definitely not coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Like the last reviewer, I too do not know why I like Frankie Tomatto's! Where Italian food is concerned, Frankie's ranks lower than East Side Mario's (sorry east sides, I love you).  My rule on buffets is this: YOU KNOW the food is going to be lower quality than a-la-carte restaurants, it's practically a no-brainer.  So you set yourself up for crappy food, you starve yourself for the day in anticipation, and so everything (and I do mean everything) looks great! 

Frankie's interior is sorta weird, like they are trying to replicate a small Italian village. Instead I feel like I'm in a cartoon painting of a Swedish Town.  The stations are pretty standard where Italian buffets go. You got the pizza, the pasta, the salad, the meats, the seafood, the bread station  and of course the desserts.  The food actually isn't too shabby, I mean again from buffet standards."}
{"text":"I think this place is the cause of me never wanting to eat western food anymore because I feel like I'm going to pop anytime I stuff myself with carbs like this.

When I was young, I came here every few months.. THAT'S A LOT. Damn, my family spent a lot of money on this place. Every birthday, every time we'd have a tourist friend over.. we seem to always be coming back! As a kid, I thought the theatrics of this place was really cool and I remember taking numerous embarrassing tourist photos in front of the fake tower of pisa and the beautiful lights after it lit up at night. I loved the interior and I think they did go all out to make Frankie's the way it is. You can even learn Italian in the bathrooms, which was cool when I was young but quite unnerving now as I am trying to do my business. The buffet is set up nicely and it used to be even more grand than it is now. The food now is mediocre at best and I find myself enjoying the Caesar salad and the fruits the most out of everything- which is quite problematic if I'm paying over $15-$25. The pasta is okay but not amazing. There's a lot of variety but nothing really keeps my taste buds going in that area. I do enjoy the variety of meatballs they offer. Another star of the show is the calamari and the ribs, which hungry hands are waiting to grab. The food generally is not bad, but not great. For me, way too much carb overload and I am stuffed after 2 plates of salad, calamari and meatballs. I also like to enjoy some soup wherever I go and the minestrone here is pretty satisfying. The desserts are mediocre- nothing that leaves me speechless or tempted. In fact, I usually choose to go for the fresh watermelon and cantaloupe as a meal closer instead of the stale brownies or weird cakes. Their ice cream bar used to be HUGE, with all different flavours of ice cream and sprinkles/cones offered on the side. I am disappointed now as I see that the 'ice cream bar' only consists of 4 sorbet pumps: vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and cappuccino... I think the kid in me just cried. 

I come here now maybe once a year if not less, unless somebody else suggests it. The childhood memories have already been lived and relived numerous times and it is definitely time to take a step into adulthood. Ps. I used to get the Frankie birthday package every year and it used to be exciting. Now seeing the same thing, I cringe and face palm to the fact that I used to enjoy disturbing the entire section of the buffet while sticking my finger into a tomato balloon and taking a polaroid with a scary Frankie cut out. Oh god. (PPS. I'm pretty sure it's not free anymore, so I wouldn't bother)"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a pasta craving this is the place to go.   I always have a good time when I come here and has a lot of selection at the Buffet section.   

The pizzas are delicious and I always wait for a fresh one out of the oven.   

It does get busy here at night but weekday lunches are usually not that bad."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night for their dinner buffet. I eat dinner early so I was able to get their early bird special. Early bird special for dinner is 5:00-5:30 pm. You can arrive anytime during 5;00-5:30 to get $15.99 early bird special. After 5:30pm, dinner buffet isb$18.99. On fridays they have seafood special so it is a tad more expensive. Early bird is $20.99 before 5:30. 

The outside of this restuarnt is quite unique with vibes of Italy. The same can be said aboit the interior. For dinner, they have a wide variety of food from pastas, pizzas, breads, salad, soup, meats, calamari, and different roasted vegetable. The food isnt of highest quality and you can get quite thirsty afterwards. However foods were put out in smaller quantities to keep it fresh. There are alot of people working inside, so foods get refilled frequently. 

Honestly ordering pasta from Boston pizza is more than $15.99. So if you take some pasta, some salad, and some calamari, you already get your price worth of food. Plus you get to try different foods too. Although the quality isnt amazing at this place, with that prize its worth it. They have a wide variety of pizza that are freshly baked. 

I recommend taking their freshly baked garlic bread and adding some diced tomato to make bruschetta. Pretty yummy!

Although there was a wide selection of dessert, don't expect anything good. The ice cream was alittle melty, and alot of the baked goods were a little stale. You can tell it isn't fresh.

Lunch is $14.99 and they don't have early bird. With the dinner early bird, we didn't have any time constraint. We were there for a pretty long time. But you get stuffed pretty quickly because of all the carbs. I recommend reservating a table if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Let me tell you why I like this place. I like them only on Monday through Thursday after 9 pm. Because the dinner buffet is only $ 12.99 at that time.

If you are looking for authentic italian dishes, I would not recommend this place. But if you are hungry and like to pack up on somewhat tasty food, this place is for you. Nothing special to write for them, this is a buffet.

The quality may not be always that great, for me the ribs were tender, the fish and meat items were tasty. I did not like their pastas or pizzas that much though. But I did not care as for 12.99 my stomach was happy.

I will not pay more than that for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good for big groups with ample space

Buffet has good selection  though I wouldn't say the taste was spectacular or anything of that sort. Food is ok hence a 3 star. Pricey as what you'd expect for buffets. 

I'd rather go to Dragon Pearl buffet near York Mills and Leslie. Then again, just my preference. 

Comparing to Mandarin buffet, I would pick Frankie. With Congee Queen, I feel my taste buds were more satisfied there than Frankie. So only when I'm not into Asian cuisine and with a group who would rather go for non-Asian food, then I'd pick Frankie."}
{"text":"Well I broke down and took a hungry grandson to Frankie's. After 1 piece of cheese pizza (a few bites), and 3 zittis, he was ready for dessert.

A few little desserts later, he was ready for Ice Cream. After a couple of Ice Cream balls (Chocolate and Vanilla), he pronounced himself ready to explode.

I sampled a few things, and they were not nasty, actually edible, and much better than last time.

You can't beat the 'fun value' of Frankie's for a hungry kid. And thus I am 'upgrading' my precious review. Fine italian dining it ain't! But fun it is especially for kids."}
{"text":"My son's (and my) favourite place to eat! LOVE the veggie meatballs! Highly recommend them! The mashed potatoes are a fav too!"}
{"text":"If I can possibly give negative stars I would.  We made reservations for a little girl's b-day party for 6:30 pm.  We all arrived a few minutes before the reservations.  Two hours later we were still waiting.  After the first 30 minutes we asked the hostesses how much longer the wait was and was assured the table we were waiting on paid and would soon leave.  An hour later and several other groups approx. the same size as ours got seated with NO reservations, we approached the hostesses again and they gave us the same answer.  No attempts were made by the management to help us out.  One and half hours later, we were livid.  More groups with no reservations got tables before us.  Two hours later we finally got a table.  Unfortunately the food was not hot, there were no clean plates and no spoons at the soup table.

The management was very disappointing.  No offers for a free drink for the birthday girl even though we waited two hours.  I understand if we didn't have reservations.  But what is the point of making reservations if we are going to wait that long?  Because of the extra wait, the little girl was not able to have a little get together at her home after dinner.  This experience has truly made me think twice about going there again."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's is one of those places you go to for the experience not the food, but what an experience it is. From the leaning tower out front, to the Italian cliches plastered over the walls, to the bathroom music teaching you Italian you never forget what type of restaurant you are eating at. The food itself is hit or miss depending on what you like. The pizza was not great, the seafood was my favourite, some of the pastas were not bad, and the chicken parmigiana is solid. Also would recommend the waffles for dessert. I will definitely come back to Frankie Tomatto's but it might be in a year or two once the nostalgia sets in again."}
{"text":"Everything was above great but one exception

Badda boom badda bing 

And the chicken parm gotta be fixed man 

But overall great staff lots of seats 

Line ups for the food but quality is pretty good 

Ice cream machine is amazing"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant Italian cuisine at its finest. Never once have I been disappointed with their level of customer service a long with the delectable array of meal choices. I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in the Woodbine & Steelcase area stop in and check them out."}
{"text":"Came here for an early Monday dinner with the family.  The place has changed since the last time I was here.  The choices of foods have slightly increased which is great, because selection is always a good thing.  The service was very efficient, the food, and atmosphere was definitely a plus! I was surprised to see that they have a lot more choices for meatballs, from Beef, to pork...very nice....I think ill be coming back to this place that I used to dread coming to when i was younger.  This place as always has a great selection of foods, and the prices are always reasonable.  They even have early bird buffets specials from $13....half price for Seniors on certain days, etc...."}
{"text":"At Frankie Tomatto's it's about quantity, not necessarily quality. The variety is great, obviously for an all you can eat Italian buffet, but much of the pastas are a bit mushy and my calamari had grit. It won't stop me from coming back, but not often, and with expectations set reasonably."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's is a great buffet style restaurant with lots of options to choose from in Italian food."}
{"text":"Been here before, but has been a few years.  Was here for a birthday party and food wise, I'd say it was 1 of the better experiences.  There are plenty of selections here, whether it is pizza, pasta, sides.  Roast beef was nice too, same as the seafood chowder. And I like the big cups they have for drinks.  This place gets busy though, and there does not seem to be much room to move around, luckily we were in the section by the door, so there was some room for stroller, and other items. Line ups for the food can get long as well, but moves pretty well I'd say. Good place to check out, that is for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for a work function and I will NOT come back.  Even my co-worker said they had to pay me to eat here. We were here on a Thursday night and I was so surprised that there were so much traffic in the restaurant. I would say people come here for the quantity not for the quality. For roughly same amount of money or even a little bit more I would rather go Scaddabush for a way better dining experience. My reasonings for not coming back are several however I am only going to point out a few. First, the seating is very tiny and uncomfortable. You barely got any space between you and the person who sits besides you. Also your table is super close to others. Secondly, the quality of food...baked salmon was dry, pizza dough was hard and dry without flavours, and the roast beef was not tasty and  it was not cut properly. Lastly, there was a bug in my water. I can understand restaurants cant be as cleaned as eating at home but!!!!! Come on~~~ at least present well when you serve your customers. Ugh will def not come again."}
{"text":"Although the price has increased. The quality and selection remains top notch. Went in on a Tuesday and everything was hot and fresh. The pastas, pizza, and all hot items were good. The deserts were all good but really miss the ice cream they used to have, not a fan of the Frozen Yogurt. Overall, still great value at $15."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's is a guilty pleasure of mine that I indulge in once or twice a year.  The others are right, the food isn't that great but it's not bad either.  I can't really explain why I like this place either other than the fact that we've been going there for as long as I remember.  I am not a fan of buffets but I do enjoy going to Frankie's for dinner.  I disagree with the accessment that Frankie ranks lower than East Side Mario's as I won't even step foot into that place.

I usually stay away from all the meats even when I did eat meat but I did enjoy their seafood items like fried fish, calamari with aoili, mussels and shrimps.  As a vegetarian, a few of my favs are the greasy garlic bread, greek salad, various types of olives, roasted red pepper & artichokes, potato rosti, eggplant parmasan and I always end my meal there with a small plate of their mini cream puffs in the dessert section."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for elementary school celebrations and family gatherings. It's a unique restaurant and the decor is lovely. It's really exciting for kids and adults alike.

The food is good and there is a lot to choose from which I always really appreciate when I go to a buffet. They have a nice variety but mind you, it's all Italian food. Basically, there's a lot of bread and pasta and heavy sauces. Honestly, I can't eat that much there so I'd rather spend my money on one amazing Italian meal. But this is a fun place to go with friends and family!

Staff here are really nice and really friendly. :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I love Frankie's and this review is after going multiple times.  

FOOD: Wide range of Italian food selections in the form of a buffet that's friendly to both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Surprisingly they have a lot of vegetarian options which is amazing cause I don't see that a lot when it comes to Italian places. They have everything from veggie meat balls, fries, various pastas, pizzas, desserts, fritters, bread, and more! They divided their buffet into different sections such as: pasta, ice cream, desserts, pizza, fruits, salad, a meat section and more! My favourite section is got to be the pasta section! They have so many options for pasta and different sauces as well as meat balls for the spaghetti. The garlic bread tastes good and the salad bar is amazing. Fruits are fresh and so is the jelly. Ice cream comes in 4
Flavours: vanilla, chocolate, mango, and cappuccino. You can even get a mix of these! The pizza is not the greatest but the other food makes up for it. 

PRICE: Lunches are cheaper than dinners and vary between weekdays and weekends as weekdays are cheaper. Lunch on weekdays: $15.99. Dinner on weekdays: $19.99. On weekends dinner is $26.99 and on holidays is $28.99. They also have brunch on weekends at $21.99. 

SERVICE: Amazing service!! Waiters are nice and quick! They clear your tables very quickly and refill the drinks just as fast. 

PLACE: There's lots of parking and and lots of seating areas! If you have an event or larger group, call in and reserve. They regularly wipe down messy areas and are clean."}
{"text":"I read the reviews online and of course, there were some bad ones.....we took the chance on this place and boy am I glad we did!!!! Amazing!!!! The ceasar salad was incredible and everything was so fresh. The eggplant Parmesan and the spicy sausage penne were my favourites. I wish we had one closer to home and next time I'm in the GTA, I'll be making a stop! 

Don't believe all you read. It's a family style buffet restaurant. Of course there will be some things you don't like and there are no waiters wearing white gloves, but if you want good wholesome food, this is the place! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Good, freshly-made food. Literally nothing tasted anything less than great. Staff was friendly and cheerful even though the house was absolutely packed on a busy Saturday night. Wound up waiting 1hr for a table for 3, just as the front desk clerk had estimated, but we'd determined to check this place out so we didn't really mind. Buffet area was a bit cramped from all the people but nothing a little patience couldn't solve. Good antipasti, tasty pizza. Great cooked meats and really tasty fresh pasta prepared from cast-iron skillets just behind the counter. Soda is served in huge cups and our server was attentive with issuing refills. A bit expensive (even for a weekend dinner buffet), but by the size of the lineup they could probably get away with charging even more. Next time, we will try to come on a weekday instead, just to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"No even close to real ITALIAN food. No taste. Poor quality ."}
{"text":"went there for the first time this summer.  busy, lots of parties going on.  service was pretty good.  i just thought that everything was cheesy.  so fake.  the decor is just dreary and pathetic.  the food was okay but the worst part was that when i came home i was just very very very thirsty!  i drank 2 L of water to quench my mono sodium glutamate induced thirst.  i have never ever experienced this before.  i will never come back here again."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I last set foot in here, but it was the chosen destination for a birthday. 

We arrived earlier than the rest of the party so we opted to get seats first. They sat us in an area where there was a either a shower or a birthday party going on, and there were a lot of new mothers, young children and just overall noise. I went to use the washroom and noticed that there was ample seating in many other parts of the restaurant which led me to think, \"Why would they seat us here?\" I know places seat guests based on who's turn it is for whichever server, but in this case.. come on.

We requested to have our table moved, and our server said ok no problem and then disappeared as quickly as he showed up. We grabbed our coats and tried to chase him but, alas, he was gone. So there we were, wandering aimlessly, looking for the server, who we never actually found. We ended up having to go back to the hostess.

So we were seated in a much nicer, quieter area of the place which was good. 

Our new server came around to get our drink orders. We ordered 2 draft Heinekens and when they came, they were flat. We let her know, and she took our drinks away. She came back about 5 minutes later and informed us that they will not change the keg because the bartended claimed \"no one else had any complaints\".. so fine. We ordered bottles instead. 

Now down to the food. Holy carb load. I mean, what was I really expecting, it was an Italian buffet. But the food here was mediocre at best. Salad bar, a mess and underwhelming. Only like 2 options for vegetables, one of which was an eggplant parmesan and the other a bland mixture of steamed vegetables. I do like my pasta but there wasn't very much to be excited about here. The dessert was even worse. A bunch of store bought crap, and faulty soft serve machines. 

I don't think I would ever come back here (by choice anyway). Avoid at all costs. I'm not even really sure how it's still here."}
{"text":"Satisfies my larger family gatherings, who tend to be simple eaters, and also really enjoy buffet's. Lots of families and children running around can be annoying.

The food is OK, and sometimes good. There are lots of options: the grill has chicken ribs veal and sausage, a deep fried station, a carving station with roast beef and pork, a couple warm dish stations, a pizza table, pasta table, salad table, an antipasto station, a soup station, vegetarian station, and three dessert tables. 

Everything seems pretty fresh, and the restaurant has a fun atmosphere, though It's a little cheesy.

Check it out if you want something cheap and easy for a large group."}
{"text":"Many years ago, I worked in this neighbourhood for several years and we used to come to Frankie Tomatto's to celebrtae birthdays and other special occasions with co-workers. I haven't been here for several years but I got invited to a graduation dinner.

It's good to see that business is still doing well, with a line of people waiting to get in. Nothing has really changed since my last visit so everything kinda looked familiar.

Our party had around 40 diners and we occupied most of the dining room that we were seated in. Coincidentally, the other table in the room was occupied by another group from the same school.

There are lots of food stations here with many choices. The turnover rate is high so the food is always fresh. The lines seem to come in waves.

Despite all the choices, I still can't resist having a salad to start. I did skip the soup this time though. What? No Caesar salad??? I always have that here!

Another favourite here is the deep fried calamari. It must be very popular because it disappears as soon as it come out. It took a few passes before I finally got some. Unfortunately, although it was tender, it was not crispy but it tasted okay. Slightly disappointed.

I tried the beef ribs and pork ribs. Both hardly had any meat on the bones. I had to scrape it off. Flavour was okay.

Too many pastas to choose from but I tried the crab ravioli and the crab was AWOL. I didn't taste or see any crab. The meatballs were nice, especially with the cream sauce.

The pizza was very good, freshly made, nice crust. The roasted chicken was also very nicely seasoned and cooked.

I didn't have any room left for dessert but managed to have some fresh fruits and a little bit of soft-serve mango ice cream. Not bad.

Even though I've mentioned a few misses here, the overall experience wasn't bad, especially considering how busy they were. Our servers did an admirable job, keeping up with clearing plates, refilling drinks, splitting bills at the end, and smiling throughout the evening. Good job!"}
{"text":"The one good thing about this restaurant is that it keeps the kids happy. Other than that, I was not very happy with any other aspect. The staff were quite unfriendly and the service was poor. There was confusion among them as to where to seat us and as I stood back and watched them try to figure it out, it was clear they were very unorganized and even rude to one another about it. The server forgot/misunderstood our drink order multiple times. The food was disappointing, especially the desserts. There was not one thing I wanted to get more of. Like I said, the good part about our experience here was that the kids could eat and talk as much as they wanted and I didn't have to worry too much about them. The atmosphere was already very loud and busy with lots of kids running around. It's just too bad the food and service were so lacking that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Low-quality, cafeteria style food with extremely rude servers. Its also very loud and crowded, no matter what time you choose to dine."}
{"text":"I am from California and every time I come to visit my family here, my first priority is this place. Of course it is a time to catch up with family, but the food here is plentiful and the atmosphere is unlike any other I've witnessed! I strongly suggest the lasagna, or anything for that matter. Much loveABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL"}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn about whether to give this 2 or 3 stars. The food is decent at best -- typical americanized Italian fare. The pizza was ok, the veggie lasagna was probably the thing I enjoyed most, gnocchi was overly salty, and the other pastas were just ok. Dessert was your standard selection of bite-sized pastries that are supplied out-of-the-box by some food supplier that also does other buffets. Surprisingly there were a decent number of vegetarian (even vegan!) options, and the staff were quite accommodating and willing to make my friend a cheeseless pizza.

I found my experience with the staff to be positive -- they were friendly and courteous. My friend found a piece of plastic in her salad. Our waitress was very apologetic about it. Unfortunately the manager was \"too busy\" to come out and say anything about the plastic piece, so I'm ready to echo the other reviews in that management probably don't care about customer service any more (making too much money already). No formal token of apology was given. Our waitress Claudett though was excellent.

This place is PACKED. Arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday and we waited for close to 45 minutes. They don't take reservations after 5PM. The buffet area is super tight and hard to get around in. Add to that all the little kids you have running around and you've got quite the hazardous buffet experience. There were a few times I thought I wouldn't make it out of there alive."}
{"text":"Good service, yummy food with good variety, and interesting decor on the outside as well as inside.  The twisting paths with the little booth things are so cute, I really like the gelato place.  It looks a lot bigger in pictures than the actual place, but is still quite spacious.  I like how the seating allowed me to be separate from the other diners.  

Also found it very nice how they sing to the birthday people, the waiters & waitresses seem like they actually enjoy themselves.  

The washrooms scared the shit out of myself & my boyfriend though, we initially did not know who or what was talking.  

It was only $16.99 for dinner (on a Thursday) and I found it an amazing value, considering the other AYCE places I've been to

I was kind of disappointed in the rice pudding though, it's one of my favourite foods."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian fare. Probably not worth it unless you can scarf tonnes of food down in one sitting. 

Pros
+ Service: Katherine was friendly, attentive and accommodating. Loved the ocassional banter in between servings. 

Cons
- Food: mediocre, lackluster. Good variety (3 soups, salads, pastas, crab legs, potatoes---holy tons of potatoes--, breads, pizzas) but overall they held one commonality: rather bland tasting. 

The only saving grace was the Italian wedding soup and strawberry rotilinis. This is a classic example of \"quality decreases as quantities increase\" kind of a buffet."}
{"text":"We liked it. Not out of this World - but it was a solid effort and while every dish would not please everyone - there is enough to try for everyone to have something good.

Our Waiter Jay was above awesome to that helped our impression.

Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Great place to eat with family. very COZY. Pice is Ok, 
This is Your place if You like Italian food, A lot of Pizza and my fav the Ribs. 

Ton's of fresh fruit. Lots of Parking. 

Give it a Try. service is not that Good."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's is an Italian buffet in Markham near Woodbine/Steeles.  It's beautifully decorated, and people come here from all nationalities.

I have been here many times years ago mostly for lunch with co-workers, I was here again for dinner today and I think it's better now than before.   I see they have renovated.   They have a new pastry counter which is cute, and the ice cream parlour section is now hiding next to it.

They celebrate birthdays and have live music.  This place is quite big, I find myself getting lost sometimes especially with the crowds!

The food is nice, they don't have much gluten-free options though, I only saw a few pastries which were gluten free.

It's crowded and a bit noisy here so if you don't like crowds or noise this is not the place for you.

They have early bird special, 5-5:30pm Mon-Thurs for $13.99, but you have to finish eating within that 30 minutes.  Parking is plentiful, staff is friendly.  Great for parties, kids love this place!"}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's has been around for a long time and this is my first time back in at least 15 years. 
We went on a Monday evening and it was pretty busy but not full. There is a wide variety of food but I would say that you are definitely there for quantity over quality. The taste of the pasta is bland, the roast beef is tough and the salmon is hard and over cooked. While the food is edible, it wasn't good. The best thing was the soft serve ice cream and waffles. The waitress was friendly and service was good but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great choice for lunch, price reasonable, food taste good, especially the desserts are to die for! the chocolate dipped cream puff is so yummy!"}
{"text":"Extremely low quality food. Mass produced everything. Nasty and disgusting low end meats and vegetables. Would never return."}
{"text":"This place isn't what it used to be. I used to come here a lot growing up, and even in adult life. It used to have such better food, and now it tastes like everything is pre-packaged or frozen. The only food that feels fresh here is the salad bar. Even their ice cream was cheap, low-quality ice cream. They used to have so much seafood everywhere, and now it seems there's less seafood dishes. The mussels used to be so good, and the other day when I went they were the smallest mussels I have ever seen. The sauce was so salty and gross. On top of that they charge ~$25 a head, plus drinks/tax/tip. It might be worth it if the food quality was good, but to be completely honest there was nothing at the buffet that made it worth the price."}
{"text":"when they say buffet, they really do mean huge ass buffet selections.
they have pasta, meat, fruits, cake, ice-cream, pizza, salads, etc..etc.. I lost count on how many items they have.
fortunate enough I tried every single piece of them and let me tell you.
don't eat, just watch and take pictures.
this place have the worst ever italian food. but they have huge amount of food, people seems don't care going in and just stuffing their face.

as I said, if you want to look at the large selection of buffet, same size as bellagio, with fraction of the cost. you can come here. but be warn, just to take pictures."}
{"text":"the only word i could say about this italian buffet is: garbage food  I found 3 small bugs in their letus salad and no services,dont disrespect your body and your pocket. I felt they are attacked
I dont know why ontario doesnt conltrol these carless kichens ever..."}
{"text":"I've been to Frankie's 3 times. The first time was good, second time, not bad. Yesterday, it was absolutely terrible. The food was just thrown together as if they didn't care. It was flavourless and not very appetizing. It had to have been the first time I left a buffet, hungry."}
{"text":"The last time I was here before this visit was in high school when I didn't know anything about the quality of food. I remember hating the buffet!
However, from my most recent visit, it wasn't as bad as I remembered it! I came here after 1pm for lunch with my coworkers and this place was packed!
The food was decent, the options were decent but man there were lines for everything.
All in all I had a good experience and the service was great!"}
{"text":"The WORST buffet in the GTA. I found the food EXTREMELY salty. The tables and seats were so uncomfortable, there wasnt much dessert choices. I wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Last time i was here was over 7yrs ago!!.
I came here for a Bday party. The place hasnt changed much.  Parking lot gets filled fast!!

Inside has a nice feel to it. Good Italian atmosphere. Food looked good. The grilled sausage was hard and dry. The Roast beef was eh... could be better.

The seafood section with calamari, mussels, and Salmon fillet was.. ok

The Minestrone soup was good!! Nice and hot, I'm not sure if they just refilled it, but it was HOT (temperature).

So i give 3 stars for the food. Also, it was not refilled fast enough, some of the buffet platters, were pretty empty.

For service, our young waiter was great!!  He refilled my water before i can even ask, he took away the plates quickly. I would give him 5 stars !!!

One pet peeve is the narrow section of the buffet area. It just bottlenecks too often, and because of this, people turn back or don't know how to line up.

3stars for food quality
5stars for service"}
{"text":"It had been a while since we ate here. It was a Thursday night in January and not that busy. There is good selection of food to chose from. I really enjoyed their meatballs and latkes. They also have a good variety of deserts and really enjoyed the bread pudding.  As with all buffets you tend to eat more than you should. (Later in the night I was thirsty). Fun place to come occasionally but I think they should renovate the place."}
{"text":"If you don't have high expectations of buffets Frankie's is a pretty solid place. Some reviews said they are average at best but I haven't experience anything amazing other than the Copacabana which is higher quality at a much higher price. 

I think Frankie's is above average (some buffets you take a bite and you don't want to finish it but not here). For the price it is good value. Most of the food was done well. Good variety of salads, meat balls and pasta were good, nice tomato sauces, thick not greasy, calamari was good, pizzas were very boring though, good soups. Overall it was better than most Asian buffets. 

The service was friendly and courteous. As long as you don't come with expectations that buffets are gourmet quality I think this place is enjoyable."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday.  It was my first time at Frankie Tomatto's.  

When:  Lunch on July 11, 2014.  The price was very good.  It was 12.99 for lunch and the kids were half price.   My toddler had to pay $2.00. but that was O.K. he probably ate that much. 

Atmosphere.  Not buy on a Friday.  Everything was well placed.   Nicely decorated music was shallow and not too loud.  The smells were incredible. 

The Menu:  Lots of selection for everyone's taste.    I tried pasta, salmon, and the garlic bread.  The garlic bread was fresh and tasty.  The pasty was good.   The rice was not good.  Drinks were free on fridays. 

The Service.  The waitress was nice and answered are questions when needed.  

Birthday Package.  It was my birthday but did not know there was a birthday package.  Perhaps if the waitress or front desk asked if it was anyone's birthday we would have indicated this to them.  But I guess it is common sense to indicate that before ordering."}
{"text":"We went to Frankie Tomato for Sunday lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The washroom was clean and well lit. The staff was friendly and efficient. The restaurant was full which is a good sign.

Frankie Tomato is an Italian ayce buffet restaurant. It is similar to Mandirin restaurants. The food was pretty good for an ayce restaurant. In addition to the pasta dishes, they had Canadian dishes such as roast beef, BBQ chicken, and beef ribs.

I started with the seafood chowder. It was good, but kind of salty. The salmon had no flavor. The BBQ chicken and roast beef were tasty. I had the sausage penne which was very good. I has another pasta dish which was very good. Frankie Tomato had a station where you can create your spaghetti dish.

Would we go back? Maybe, but it is out of the way for us."}
{"text":"Wow! My first time here in Toronto.
The food is good, so many dishes to try.
Incredible the amount of people to prepare all this food. 
If the amount of people and tight seating isn't for you, then you might not like it.
There's outside seating , if available.
It's a different experience"}
{"text":"Whats not to luv about frankies rustic italian feast for the whole family to enjoy

Service is always smiley here!!

Perfect for big eaters."}
{"text":"My first one star review.
I gotta give this to Frankie Tomatto's for food poisoning me. I didn't even make it out the restaurant door last night and I'm still feeling like crap this morning.

Haven't been here since forever. I knew it was a bad idea because they got flagged for food safety and quality control last year... but I was here last night to celebrate a birthday. 

9 out of 10 people I talked to about this today told me WTF was I even doing there lol. The one person I talked to who still goes, will stop going from now on.

I posted it on IG story this morning and people actually reached out to me telling me horrible food experience and horrifying kitchen x food prepping stories. Thank you so much. If you want to know how bad it actually is, please PM me.

Service was attentive. The food actually tasted not bad (but the aftermath is when the shit storm arrives, literally). But holy shit, I'm never coming back again."}
{"text":"The food was good although not many options to choose from. The reason why I am giving a 1 star is because of the service. It started as usual but it changed to worst. It was so hard to even get the server to refill our glass of water. Afterwards he brought us the cheque without us asking for it and we felt we were being kicked out of the place. What was worst is that he even approached us with the debit machine and asked us if we were paying and after we did, he said we had 5 minutes to vacate the table because there were customers waiting. What amazed me was that there were plenty of tables available. Not coming back definitely. Worst server!!"}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with the food quality.

The decor is quite outdated... but in some add way it works.

The buffet layout is along the main pathway with stations to the left and right of you.

The soft serve ice cream and a part of the desserts is tucked in a small passage... a bit odd.

This place sure makes every inch count... filled with food, seating and decorations.

My low rating is simply due to the food quality.  I take it that the dishes are made in big quantities.  The pasta was overcooked and poorly seasoned.

The meats were dry... 
The desserts selection was minimal.

Not worth it to go again."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better.  Selection was limited compared to other buffets.  I went on the lunch buffet.  They had 3 types of soup, pizza, ice cream/desert, pasta, spaghetti, meatballs, salads, fruits.

Outside the spaghetti and meatballs, there wasn't really anything i enjoyed.  And it was 18.99 for weekend lunch.  There was the grill, but the roast beef was way too tough,  chicken was dry, so was the fish.  Calamari was ok.

Dining area smelled liked cheese, that couldn't be helped, but there was 4 birthday songs during our 1 hour there and it go a little uncomfortable.  Layout could of been better.

Go once to experience it, but due to quality of food, probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I was here for the first time. The staff was ok, not all of them were friendly, but most of them were. It was cool that they song Happy Birthday to every person whom birthday was on that day. The food was very delicious, they had different kind of foods which was great. The restaurant was in Italia style which made it unique. Overall, I liked it."}
{"text":"The food here is mostly italian food as the name implies. That means mainly pizza, pasta and meatballs. Honestly, the pasta isnt too bad. Its not mushy and overcooked. Its just that there isnt a great selection. The other options are ok as well. A couple types of meat like chicken and beef. Theres also a salad bar and vegetarian dishes available for those who need it. 

Maybe its because Im not big on italian food, but I didnt really end up eating too much because I was just not drawn into the food. 

The service was excellent. We had a very large group and they did a great job getting everybodys beverages and accommodating any requests. 

I pobably wouldn't come back though, as the food just doesnt appeal to me."}
{"text":"Just like how you never forget who gave you your first STD, I will never forget Frankie's. My sister and I plus both our friends got food poisoning thus vomiting and diarrhea for days after eating here. First time I threw up and crapped at the same time. We suspect it was the mussels but the manager thinks we want to come back for a free meal. No thanks, but I called the food safety inspectors in case they want take up that offer."}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatoe's

I've been here too many times  that I can walk with blindfold and still be able to spot where the beef ribs, calamari, lemon, gnocchi, roast beef, pizza and ceasar salads are. The menu has not changed in MANY years. This is a default birthday restaurant place because for $ 7, they will sing for your celebrant. The catch? Almost every group has a birthday celebrant - all of them anxiously waiting for their Frankie Tomato birthday song and dance portion. 

It's cute. They give celebrants a tomato-shaped balloon, a Frankie Tomatoe crown and take your pictures. And comes with $ 6.99 are three tired waiters clapping for the celebrants. 

The food is not great but the experience makes it worthwhile to go. That is, if you have an egoistic friend whose life dream is to be serenaded. 

In terms of food (I keep forgetting I am reviewing a restaurant), my choices are beef ribs, salmon, cheesecake, seafood pasta and their clam chowder. It's a buffer so come in an empty stomach. 

Oh did I tell you that there's an Italian language lesson in the bathroom? Seriously. Bring your assignment."}
{"text":"If for some reason you don't know about the existence of Pizza Hut or you are just so tired of it already  you might want to check out Frankie Tomatto's. This being one of the cheapest buffets around town is probably the only positive thing I can say about it.
The food is an American take on Italian favorites, lots of bread, garlic, onion, pasta, Kraft dressings and not much else. It is very loud inside with lots of children running around, overall not my cup of tea. 
If I want Italian I go to Italian restaurant if I want pizza I call pizza delivery and if I want pasta I cook it my self, not much space left for Frankie."}
{"text":"Last time I've been here was maybe 15 years ago.  Dined here with my husband recently because he always wanted to try it :). We went for the early bird special ($13.99 between 5-5:30pm), and I have to say, this place is still pretty good. Of course, do not expect amazing Italian food but it's worth it for the price!  The garlic bread, pizza and the eggplant Parmesan were my favourites!  Desserts galore as well!  The bread pudding was my top pick!  The deep fried foods weren't too tasty (calamari and fried fish) because they were sitting out for too long.  I'm sure they would have tasted better if I got them fresh.  Overall, pretty good experience given that it's only &13.99/person! :)"}
{"text":"Came here with friends at lunch haven't been here for a long time food OK. Would be back again soon."}
{"text":"Great place to go to, especially if there's a birthday. It's a little pricey but there isn't much variety. Though I love coming here some of the food is very dry and some of the salad looks like it's been sitting there all day. Wish it did have more of a variety, but it makes sense since it is an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday. 

There's hardly any cuts of meats. Yes this is an Italian buffet but there's tonnes of pasta and spaghettis which it'll make you full rather quickly. The lettuce in Caesars salad is not fresh, taste like it's been refrigerated from last night. Chicken is super salty which it will make you drink water, therefore making you full. 

Disappointing dinner. Would give this place zero but the service was quite good. Overall the food was terrible!  Bill with tip and after tax came to $28. Not worth it!"}
{"text":"food is good. Wait staff has been great a few times- thank you! 
Front desk hostess team is terrible! they act like they are too busy for you, face frowning no smiles, and speak in a tone that seem like we are begging for their help. For example today a young girl JENN made us wait and then sat us at a wrong table, when we made light of it she told me there was no other table when there was #88 that was available. she told us to get it ourselves! told us to get a waiter and tell them so but the grumpy older man in our section said no, he said he didn't get instructions and would not let us sit there. By accident a few receptionists were walking by and we grabbed them to help. One was totally useless, the red hair one, who said \"I am all confused\" when we are explaining it. The other one got through the earset and communicated for us. The point is WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIGHT FOR A TABLE THAT WOULD SEAT OUR PARTY.  we were starving and Darren our waiter was very friendly and helpful, made up for their inadequacy of the hostess.  We would have complained to management and left. Darren was a great team member. management should get some cheerful reception hostess who are more professional and more mature."}
{"text":"carb city.
i try my best to fill up on the meat here, but sometimes you just gotta fill up on a bit of carbs. i find it really hard to avoid the lasagna. i kill the calamari every time though. make sure u have no plans after dinner because you are gonna want to sleep."}
{"text":"We like to come here annually for fiancés birthday dinner. We enjoy the ribs and mussels here. And, I also like the pizza and desserts. The waitors are good at clearing tables. The only gripe was one time, the waitor was rushing us to finish. He told us the restaurant was closing but they were opened for at least another 20-30 minutes. There were still other diners eating. I called the restaurant to make sure if we had enough dining time before going because we arrived later in the evening. If coming during the busy hours, be prepared to wait around 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I only can say don't even waste a dollar in this restaurant! 
I truly regret spending money and time there!
The food quality is REALLY low and does not have that much a variety!!"}
{"text":"The service is quick and the servers always seem friendly and genuine. The food is mediocre and their pastas lack flavour / freshness. This place is good for taking pictures, but not really for the food. I give it a 3.5/5."}
{"text":"After 10 years, I decided to return to Frankie to see how they are doing now.

Keeping in contrast that this is a buffet, a lower standard is used. But seriously, chicken was dried, so dried there are no juicy flowing out. We even saw the rotisserie and though it should be good. But no, its dry. The ribs look great but once you put a fork to it..... What, the fork doesn't penetrate the meat.......

The mussel is not fresh, since seafood freshness is key to safe food, I will not be reviewing it since I don't want to risk my life writing this review.

There are some safe heaven to this catastrophic lunch, stick to the pasta, they are not great but better that the other stuff we tried. Parmasan chicken is good, with cheese. The meatball is pretty ok too.

Given the fact that I want to enjoy a lunch, not survive a lunch, I give it a thumbs down. 

Sorry Frankie, your tomato has gone bad."}
{"text":"Always driving by and saw the line up outside tried the buffet inside. The decor is interesting, reminded me of las Vegas ceasars and the spread was quite extensive. For 13.00 just the diy pasta bar and fruit stand would be worth the money. Don't expect high end but a notch above food court. Not too shabby for a buffet restaurant"}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to eat here.   The selection of food at the buffet is amazing and the staff are so friendly and professional.  They offer both vegetarian and meat options. I especially love their pastas. Plus the atmosphere and decor are simply beautiful.  During one visit we were seated near a wall of decorative glass bottles. I couldn't stop looking at them.  Another thing I really love about this restaurant are the beautiful statues in front of and around the restaurant. Perfect for taking pictures. It really gave an Italian feel to the restaurant.  Overall this is a great place for friends and family to get together.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're in a big group, and all they care for is quantity, not quality, go for it. Usually in a buffet, there's at least one thing I like and may go back for seconds. Not here. Heads up, this place sucks for anyone with tastebuds"}
{"text":"Bad so-called Italian food, bad tasting, disgusting floor, noisy beyond acceptable limits, completely not-fresh seafood. 

Ugh!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty descent with a lot of pasta and spaghetti. The turkey meatballs were my favourite. The price isn't too bad if you go for the early bird"}
{"text":"Frankie Tomatto's is a good place to go for AYCE buffet when you are tired of all those Japanese and Chinese buffet places.

I only come here when there are visitors from overseas... ok one of that is my mother! She loves to try out little bit of this, little bit of that, she got to see what she is eating and when she does not eat Japanese, this is a good alternative.

Talking about kids having fun here! If you have kids, please go Monday. If you don't have any, please avoid at all cost going there on a Monday! I did not realize that Kids eat free on Monday with 1 paying adult... and of course the whole restaurant was overun by sugar high  kids. I have to fight with the kids in order to get my dessert/ice cream.

There are weekday specials, early bird specials.. so make sure you check out the deals on the website to plan your visit accordlingly!"}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed for years! It's almost been 20 years since I moved to markham and everything it still the same.  Not the best Italian Restaurant around, but still pretty good. It's perfect for those who can't make up their minds for pasta as you can try a little bit of everything.  Their garlic bread and cappuccino soft serve is really good (must have!)"}
{"text":"This buffet is just GREAT.  The food there is DELICIOUS, and they have a lot of food.  The food there is fresh.  Plus, the staff there are absolutely amazing.  They're friendly, kind and helpful.  They always have a smile on their face.  I'm definitely coming back there again."}
{"text":"I love this place because of the variety of foods that can be had. I know many others that hate it though. 

Don't go here expecting authentic Italian food. The cooks are Oriental and Sri Lankans."}
{"text":"Lots of food options and some halal too.  Fun place to bring the family especially. Great service!"}
{"text":"Buffet with high variety of italian food. Probably you will not be able to try everything. Go hungry. Food is tasty. Very good place to celebrate a special date with a group of people."}
{"text":"Great food. The decor and the whole atmosphere of the place was amazing. I come from Europe and this place is too Italian.  There is so much variety that I didnt know what to pick. So cheap for what they offer. Must visit. 
Service was what you would expect from a buffet. Basic."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place to have dinner and mingle with family (with young kids), its an excellent choice. 
If you're a foodie and looking for good quality food, look elsewhere. 
We have a fairly big family with a lot of young kids; and came here for dinner to celebrate a family member's birthday. My nieces and nephews had a great time. 
My breakdown for this place: 
- 5 stars for family oriented-atmosphere. 
- 4 stars for value. Prices are not bad, kids can eat for $2 on Monday nights. 
- 1.5 stars for the food. I didn't really like any of the food. Food was starchy and salty. 
- 5 stars for service. Although it was quite busy there tonight, our server Dillon, was attentive, quick, and friendly. This made up for the lousy quality of the food.

Overall, I would come back for family get together but not for dinner with the hubby."}
{"text":"Last week, I went there with my family to celebrate my mom's birthday. All of us really liked it. We loved the food and everything was so perfect. My mom was amazed with the little birthday  muffin they gave her. 
 The only bad thing is that it is so far as we live in Toronto, however ttc can take you there."}
{"text":"I'm not Italian so I don't really know what authentic Italian food taste like but I for sure remember the taste of pizza when I went to Italy when I was younger. Overall, fair amount of food to chose from. The pastas to me were good. I love sauce so drench the pasta with sauce. The roast chicken was nice and juicy. The meat was medium rare which is to my liking. The pizzas were okay. Some pizzas were out too long and hence stale. The dessert table was also okay. The highlight for me was lasagna! Love lasagna! The lasagna killed me because it was so heavy but good. The ribs on the other hand was too cooked, nice sauce though, sweet with a little tang. I wish there was more food to pick from. A lot of seats with little to food to pick from. 

The server Bernie was really good, attentive. The parking lot is small. So definitely be patient with their high peak hours. Buffet will never be perfect but I'll return again."}
{"text":"Super fun restaurant. The buffet food is high quality and fresh..and there's a great selection. I particularly enjoyed the salad bar and the carving station. Lots of options if you are trying to eat lite. They even have gluten free available. Our server was friendly and the drinks were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night and we were extremely happy with the service and the food.  The seafood was awesome as hubby is vegetarian.  The service was pretty good and yes the price was a lot better than most places we visited in Canada.  

Our only concern was they seemed to have had an issue accepting our credit cards from the US."}
{"text":"Essentially Mandarin but with Italian food. 

Large open concept with different kinds of pasta, pizza and Italian food. For the price this is quite a good value. We had several different kinds of meat balls, pasta and garlic bread. 

Worth the $40 bucks for 2"}
{"text":"I paid 25 dollars for dinner at this place. I dont even know where to start, the food was close to inedible, the calamari tasted fishy and I was afraid that it was spoiled before it was cooked. Everything was incredibly bland, the meatballs all tasted the same and the ravioli tasted like it was raw, because it was stone cold inside. 25 dollars is not cheap at all, incredibly dissapointed at the food. Complete garbage.  Take your money somewhere else and get a real meal."}

{"text":"The quality of food has definitely deteriorated over the years. While the prices are competitive with other buffets, I think it is better to avoid this place until they improve their food drastically. If you have to come, go on a weekend night or a time when it is busier.

1. Totally agree with the food, especially the meat, being super dry
2. The pizzas were one of the few acceptable foods
3. Tried 3 different types of pasta and they either had too little sauce or were too greasy
4. Seafood was absolutely terrible
5. Soups were too salty for my taste
6. Desserts haven't changed much, average quality

On a positive note, Frankie's handles bigger parties very well and the overall design of the restaurant allows easy access to the buffet wherever your table is. They are also known for birthday celebrations because the waiters come and sing for you with some recorded music."}
{"text":"I really don't know how this place has endured so long...or is it SURVIVED so long!?!
I've been to this place what seems like decades ago.  The formula and the place hasn't changed and the food is still MEH!
I don't see why my fam seems to want to celebrate birthdays there.  Just a warning...It gets packed at dinner and special days - DO NOT EVEN THINK about it during Mother's Day!  I remember the carnage the last time I was dragged there.  Also, how dare you even torture your Mother by going there!?!
Ok...the survival guide to Frankie's.
One...if you have fickle eating kids - don't bother going there.  Though they have a wide variety of things, they will just eat some pasta, fried thingys and you just blew a whack of change.
Two...if you have a chance to do lunch, do it.  It'll save your group of 15 a ton of cash.
Three...watch out for the drinks.  They push it like you need it - drug style...I think a hit of crack could be cheaper!
Four - gratuities are included in your group but your server guilts you into giving more - \"the included tip is for everyone to share, but if you like my service, please consider a small amount more.\"  Whatever.
Oh...you wanted to know about the food.
OK...stay with the salads and the carving station for proteins.  The pastas are their fill up station - lots of carbs and no nutrition. Did anyone notice how salty the food is?  Yes...it's their way for you to feel full - as you drink gallons of water so your innards don't dry up like a butterfly in a desiccant jar.  Oh..also, it's their way of pushing the drinks - druggie style!
If you like dessert, they have an ok sugar shack.  I prefer to have some fruits - which they somehow have decent fresh ones!  Bonus!
All in all, I am done with this place for another year - well you know, birthdays are annual and I know we're coming back again!  Ho-hum....

Cheers!"}
{"text":"This place has been around for so long! I just googled it and apparently it's been around since the 90's which makes sense. Although I have been coming here on and off since I was a kid, I cannot correlate my persistent visits to the taste/value of Frankie Tomatto's AYCE italian food. The food here is okay but is not cooked very well (ie. pasta over done, flavors not particularly unique nor authentic). The price is also pretty steep for a buffet that doesn't serve good food. If you're not super picky with food, the atmosphere is good for celebrations: for birthdays they do a whole song complete with a little paper wreath crown + a tomato balloon; and who doesn't love a buffet with friends (complete with italian decorations)?

Random tip: The best thing they serve are the beef short ribs! Don't miss out on that in an otherwise unremarkable menu."}
