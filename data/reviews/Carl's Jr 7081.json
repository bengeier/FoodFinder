{"text":"OMG!!! large fries were cold, soggy, limp and half full, chicken strips were the same and chewy, shake was warm and melted
Horrible experience"}
{"text":"One thing I can say is consistent with Carl Jr's is they tend to not follow their open hours. When you are headed to work and pull in at 6:05 am you expect a restaurant with posted hours for breakfast to be ready at 6, to be open !!!! 
Today was not the first time they have not been open and ready to serve at 6:00 a"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Service is slow. Everyone seems to be doing something but nothing at the same time. 

Food is okay. I have yet to find anything here that I really like enough to come back for."}
{"text":"This is my $6 burger... where's the burger? Also, I asked for honey mustard as a sauce to dip my fries in. Wtf is with your employees at this location? Never have I had a bad experience with my food from when I first ate at a  Carl's Jr.  as a kid, to this day. This is the product your putting out. Would you be satisfied paying over $10 for this and the lazy service? Also, how has this location been around as long as it has with so many negative reviews? Making money on the mouths of the tasteless and drunk. Good job"}
{"text":"Went through the drive through. The window person was nice but the food was very not nice to my boyfriends stomach this evening. Food born illnesses can be deadly (clearly not what my boyfriend has-but still)

We will not be venturing here again

Makes me wonder what we are doing to our bodies with this crap cheap food. It ends up being more expensive that the dollars and cents we hand over at the drive through window...."}
{"text":"OK, so hubby loves this place , there for, on occasion, I go.....kicking and screaming. 18.80 for 2 burgers and 2 drinks in a fast food joint?  I made him double check the receipt.  
Honestly I don't know what he is thinking, but for 4 dollars more ,or less, I will get waited on , and get a decent meal, in one fell swoop, get my foodie on , and made it worth my while.
 I think he goes there , because he considers eating just a function, not some thing to savor. I don't want to know.
 The burgers have been nasty, dry, and not much flavor, the fries have always been room temperature,in my book, cold. The ice tea is usually 2 steps this side of being  out, and the place isn't busy , except for lunch time , when the poor slobs who work around there forgot to bring lunch, and get stuck. ISH."}
{"text":"I always try the current 6 Dollar burger special they have. 
The food is always just so so. It always seems a little cold like they let things sit around too long before slapped together and tossed in a sack. They are always friendly and the interior is clean, but the food quality is sub-par at best."}
{"text":"Our visit wasn't bad at all. We were in the area for some foster parenting training. Stopped by for a quick bite to eat. We walked right in, gave our order. And what I like about Carl's Jr, they will deliver your food to you at your table. Everyone was nice, received our food pretty quickly. Place was very clean.
I tried their limited time only bourbon BBQ burger, very good. Other then that, food is like any other fast food franchise. It's OK. We had a good experience here."}
{"text":"OMG this was the strangest experience of my life. I pull up to the drive through and the guy asks if I want to try the new triple bacon burger. I say \"yes\" and proceed to give him my order. Dead silence for 30 seconds, I ask did you get the order I hear \"nope\". I respond and give him the order, dead silence again. I ask \"did you get my order\" the response \"yep\". I say \"can you please read it back to me.\" He reads it back angry and does not give me a price and I drive to the front. The guy rips the card out of my hand does not say anything to me at all. I thought what is this guys problem. So I decide to give him a taste of his own medicine and I rip the card out of his hand. How does he respond by telling me \"you think your cool, I will jump through this window and beat your a**. What is wrong with people."}
{"text":"Fast and very friendly service. The 1/3 pound burger was fresh and all but the patty itself was lacking much flavor. My wife said the same of her guacamole bacon burger. It's nice to get a side like zucchini though. Different and tasty. I think I'd give the edge overall to Jack in the Box."}
{"text":"this location i visited today was less than satisfactory, the employees showed hostility and lack of caring in the work place. specifically one employee by the name of margarita. what had a happened was my chilli cheese frys that i upgraded to was pitiful. just a few drops of chili, and a few sprinkles of cheese. hardly an upgrade if you ask me, so i took it to the counter and asked for a refund of the fries or for them to be replaced. i did ask sternly, but politely and the employee came at me with an attitude saying \"sir don't get an attitude with me, i will get you new fries, but you don't come at me and  talk to me like that\" i just agreed with the employee because im sure she would have just been more rude. she could have simply said \"ok, im sorry, let me get you a new one\" not only that , her and her cook knowingly didnt put the correct amount of chili and thought it would be ok to just skimp me on it because they didnt want to change the bag or refill the chili. that just makes this company and this location look bad. i dont mind paying extra for a quality burger and fries as most do at your restaurant, but i would like to atleast get my bang for my buck, i mean  the chili cheese fries basically looked like a regular fries in a box with a few shreds of cheese. even after they gave me the fries, she continued to glare at me in an intimidating fashion. no person should experience what i just did, i will not return to this location. this isnt the first time this location didnt show respect or care in the work place, ive had other instances at this location. their staff definitely needs to pep talk on customer service. not only that, every time i get a burger, its luke warm or a bit cold. this place is no bueno, i give it one star for lack of manners and respect for customers"}
{"text":"I guess I'll have to give up one star but how can you only have a 3 piece and a 20 piece chicken stars. My chicken club was prepared haphazard don't know how everyone else's order was but I think I'm done with this place:-("}
{"text":"Well it's OK could be better let me share a few thoughts and observations

If you work the Night shift like I do and stop in there let's say around 2 o'clock in the morning to get something to eat your going to find yourself getting very cold fries or ones that are hard as a brick they probably been laying around for a few hours, and you may find your Burger not hot at all actually try cold 

I mean think about it you get off work it's late you stopped there to get something to eat and all you get for your 15 bucks is a cold burger and cold fries and its not like this is a one time thing this happen like seven times in the last three months"}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here to quickly fill up because our stomachs were running on empty that afternoon. I stuck with the dollar menu for my sandwich (spicy chicken sandwich) and ordered a side of onion rings. The chicken sandwich was filling for the dollar I paid. It was also freshly cooked which I appreciate. The onions rings were also fresh but they were the blandest onion rings I have ever tried. Service was also prompt which is a hit or miss in fast food. Will I return? If I am in the area again and need a quick bite then yes. I will just stick with the chicken sandwich next time though."}
