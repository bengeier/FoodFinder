{"text":"The sushi is not too bad, but the portion is on the smaller side. Self service for everything including water."}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. It's a cafe-style restaurant: you order when you come in, pay, then choose a seat, and when you are done, take your tray/dishes to the garbage. The food is decent. I ordered the beef sesame bowl - didn't really taste like sesame, and there was TONS of beef on top, I couldn't even finish. I also ordered the banzai roll: tuna, salmon, avocado, cucumber rolled in tobiko. Pretty good. (We had a groupon).. Ended up \"splurging\" and ordered a \"sangria pop\"- sweet, bubbly flavored water.. The total bill was under $25 for 2 people. I am happy to have found a rice-bowl place... But I think for ambience, I'd rather stick with Kinjo...."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi, quick, and reasonable prices. We come here 99% of the time and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the sauce and rice; i take it home when i buy steaks from the butcher. To be honest the bowls and meals kinda suck. they need to make the meat fresh, not precook it. Ive tried the sushi and its decent."}
{"text":"Their bowls are the best and their special sauce!! Wish one was closer to where I lived."}
{"text":"I have moved in to the neighborhood and now I'm a regular... I always liked this place good mix of things to eat and I allays order too much because I want everything but it was always a treat and now I just eat too much....  I would give this place a try its better then Edo but avoid it around noon in the week as the high school kids take over....."}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading reviews. Bento box is very good, everything else, mediocre. Self serve order and pickup. Also had questions regarding ingredients, was handed a menus vs having a conversation, we were the only ones in line and only 2 other tables in restaurant. Tipped before knowing it was pickup your own food AND before I had to advise that there wasn't a clean table in the entire restaurant. Boo."}
{"text":"Quite tasty eats here.  My wife and I each got a different bowl (but it's been a couple weeks, so forgive me for not remembering what they were) and we both liked what we got.  If you're tired of eating at country-wide chains and are craving a good bowl, this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Alright here's the deal. I eat here roughly once a week. This place has great food (from what I've tried) and the price is hard to beat, very reasonable. Very clean restaurant. There's one lady that works the till that isn't always the friendliest and kind of \"saucy\" if you will (of course I get her everytime ).They have forgotten my sesame sauce on several occasions no biggy but when you pay for it you should get it so make sure you double check if dining out as it's 50cents."}
