{"text":"Mouthwatering!!!! I have been looking for a great Philly for a few months and this is as good as it gets. Flavor hits you right in the mouth and stays. The service both over the phone and in person is fabulous. So friendly and really seemed to want the business. It comes out to you relatively quick and is piping hot. And man its filling. I had the Jersey but definitely want to try the others. I will be back"}
{"text":"I'll admit, I've never been to Philly, so I can't comment on \"authenticity\".  Don't care!  This truck is delicious!  I've had the Philly and the Pittsburgh so far, and both were amazing.  Richard is cooking to order and doing a bang up job of making a delicious sandwich that is definitely sharing size, unless you're (justifiably) selfish because it's just that good."}
{"text":"100% excellent. Quality is here.  You have to try this. Im origionally from Pittsburgh but the New Jersey is my favorite sandwich."}
{"text":"We ordered a Jersey and Philly. Both really great sandwiches. You have to love a sandwich with fresh bread. Not sure what was in The Wiz but the flavor was amazing."}
{"text":"This was a great food truck. They really brought in some amazing cheese steaks. There was a short line to order when we arrived. There are just a few items on the menu which makes ordering super easy. The owner is great. He came out and talked to us while the cook was making our food. He really wanted to know our thoughts on how easy it was to find him and know where his truck would be. We gave him our feedback and he was appreciative of that. Its great to get some east coast food to the west!  Oh man where these things huge! It took my friend and I a while to finish scarfing these down. The cheese steaks were hot, fresh and delicious! They don't skimp on the meat or toppings.  When we came to the food truck we found they choose a good parking lot with a lot of space. Its good to have enough room for cars to park around the food truck so they are easily accessible.  We want Yelp to add in a feature so that food trucks can update their business address to the location of the truck since they move around. This way those who use Yelp can find the truck easier. Please Yelp, lets get this feature  added in soon!  I would highly recommend people to check this place out. This is amazing food that you should not pass up on it."}
{"text":"Delicious! Got the Philly with out mushrooms. The everything came together so nicely and I hear they make their bread fresh how can you beat that?"}
{"text":"How can this place only have 1 other review??  There is always a line, great food, and the owner is a great guy.  Reminds me of Pats king of steaks in philly it's so good"}
{"text":"open right now 107th and northern can't wait.to dig into this sandwich. these are so good and huge you think your back in Philly but this is AZ. best sandwich in AZ. meat is so tender and tasty nothing even close to it in AZ."}
{"text":"Have past this food truck several times but never got the chance until tonight. Boy...am I glad we stopped by. We got The Philly, The Jersey and their Cannoli...everything's homemade per Richard, the owner. Huge portions and great tasting sandwiches. Great and friendly service also from Richard and his daughter. Will be back for more."}
{"text":"East Coast Cheesesteaks has the most authentic tasting cheesesteak you will find in Arizona. Everything from the steak itself to the delicious \"whiz\" sauce, this is a very well executed sandwich. If you can find where they're at and grab you one!"}
{"text":"#BestPhillyCheesesteakEver  This is one of my favorite things I've ever eaten here in Phoenix...I say that with no exaggeration whatsoever. If this awesome food truck us set up anywhere near you, get there as fast as you can. East Coast Cheese Steaks is #BeyondAwesome."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Tasted more like an Italian beef than a cheesesteak. Price way to high for the value you receive. I do have a question for the business. Is the meat cooked on site or precooked prior to arrival ? Meat tasted soggy and my bread was already soggy after 20 seconds of giving it to me which was very strange."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I had really high hopes for this food truck. I had a cheesesteak with whiz, mushroom, and onions. The whole sandwich tasted overwhelmingly of onions. The positive is that the sandwich was stuffed with the meat mixture. The negative is I didn't like it enough to finish it. It was edible, but did not make me want to find them again."}
{"text":"This is one of the best & largest cheese steak I have had. However it took them 30 min to make it. There has to be a problem with their food prepping. It should only take 10-15 to cook prepped veggies & steak. Also another irritation was 2 other people got their food before me that orders after me."}
{"text":"Really good steaks! I especially liked the Jersey cheesesteak. We will continue to follow them."}
