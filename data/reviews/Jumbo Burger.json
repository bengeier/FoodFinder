{"text":"Now this is the place you want to go if you want to eat a real burger!  I've been coming here since I was a little kid. This place has been around long enough that my dad even used to come here as a teen.   I love how the decor hasn't changed, very 70's and 80's, gives it great character.   The burgers are fantastic. They're literally jumbo sized compared to their mainstream competitors. They're tasty and juicy. The fries and onion rings are fantastic. Best part is it's affordable.   And as if it couldn't get any better, the guys that work there are really sweet! Recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great burger and fries.  Go if you like feeling like you are eating as an extra in an episode of Rockford Files.  Don't go if you need to choose from 5 kinds of mustard to satisfy your burger cravings. They only have 1 mustard... And it's yellow. I don't even think these guys know that there are other kids of mustard...  If you like burgers, make the trip... It's worth it. Not gourmet... Not fancy... Just a decent cheeseburger made by old dudes behind the counter, kickin it old school, since before it was cool. Not much changes here, and that's ok with me."}
{"text":"Awesome burgers, nice people, very welcoming and just great prices. Their old school but it's cute, everyone I know goes there and has nothing but great things to say about it"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot.   The hours are generous so that if you have a craving at midnight you can go enjoy a great burger, fries, onion rings!  Always professional and friendly.  I absolutely highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This place brings back memories as a kid. 35+ years and nothings changed but the prices. Same people, same good food. The onion rings, souvlaki and burgers are great here, and are relatively affordable. I make it a point to go here for food when I'm in the Junction area. Very little parking. Nothing spectacular, just an ordinary, old fashioned burger. A bit of a dive, but great food."}
{"text":"This is the \"old\" from the old school. Interior hasn't changed in over 35 years by the looks of it, and neither has the taste of their burgers. If you are a 30 or 40 something and someone from out of town wants to see where burger joints started, skip the gourmet and come here. French fries are great, and the greasy onion rings are crunchy too. The burger buns were toasted and loaded as you wish. This place reminds me of the after club burger joints of the 70's and 80's.  My wife had never been to a place like this anywhere. Worth checking out for the nostalgia trip, and full of colorful regulars.  Pure rock 'n roll, and everyone should go back to their roots once in a while."}
{"text":"Been going here for many years. Always been a fan of there burgers. Flame broiled, the only way to eat them. Fries are kind of greasy, but the burger makes it all worthwhile. And pricing is fair."}
{"text":"Their chicken solvaki dinner was so good, the service is friendly and quick.   Will definitely be coming back here in the near future."}
{"text":"I love this place, the burgers are real charbroiled 100% beef. The service is excellent.  Old school goodness delivers great taste every time.  Also this is a business that helps it's community and cares.   Try the poutine, it is amazing and doesn't give me the runs like smokes or other chain places.  They do breakfast as well and the coffee is super."}
{"text":"Great place for burgers and fries!  The price of the fries is $3, and they are worth every deep fried splatter they (or you) get!  The owner is a middle-aged gentleman who is friendly and very polite!  The next time you have a burger or french fry craving, treat yourself by going there. The only 'con' is that they don't accept debit payments, only cash.  But hey, who doesn't have at least $3 cash on them??"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. Had the double banquet burger. Not overly filling. Great quality! Good price. Will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"Just a solid greasy spoon place with simple good food. I haven't explored the menu too much because burgers are why I go there. Love the char taste and the quality meat! With all the upscale stuff around it's nice to get back to the basics and leave feeling full while not having to spend a ton of money."}
{"text":"This is one of the best burger shops in all of Toronto.  I've had most of the items on the menu now and haven't been disappointed.    For a  classic experience try a cheeseburger and fries.  Both are made fresh and in house. You get to choose your toppings and the service is always impeccable.   Other highlights include homemade bbq sauce and the steak on a kaiser."}
{"text":"This place is great..open late..and they make an awesome burger..add a couple of onion rings to your burger...smile all the way home"}
{"text":"Old school awesomeness lives here in authentic 70's style decor, down to the tiles and cloth roll towel dispenser in the washroom. This is not some hipster joint with repurposed kitsch furniture. I swear it's like you stepped into a time machine. The service comes with friendly banter. You can have a field day just watching the human interactions that take place. For some reason, we only ever go here after 8pm.  The food has never failed me. My two go-to options are the cheeseburger or fish n' chips, while my husband always has the steak on a kaiser with bacon. Yes, you can ask for add-ons. While the fish aren't THE best I've ever had, it's definitely what you'd expect of a 70's burger joint and I'm completely satisfied. The fries, however, are outstanding.  Not wheelchair friendly. It's the 70's after all."}
{"text":"Well what to say about jumbo burger?    It has not changed in over 20 years, everything remains unchanged outside k the prices.  Jumbo Burger is a classic burger joint.    The home burger is well prepared and you will be satisfied however it is a bit on the expensive side. The pattie is not very thick and you are paying a gourmet burger price.  The french fries and onion rings are excellent, however I would stick with the French Fries. The onion ring portions are overly small, I think the last time I had onion rings there must have been 4-5 onion rings in the box.  Not a bad place, not the greatest place but nice to visit for the nostalgia. The food is decent but the prices leave something to be desired."}
{"text":"Great burgers, Steak sandwich also great. Love this place, only downside, cash only."}
{"text":"The burger was massive the patty was a bit overcooked. But it still had favour, but it wasn't anything special as far as a good burger. The onion rings were lacklluster too much batter  Probably won't come here again, location is odd and out of the way. Just came to try because of it good review. But sometime review can be wrong  The decor was odd , reminded me of my grandmother kitchen but what can you do"}
{"text":"I've been going here as long as I can remember and my parents have been going since 1981. Amazing burgers and it's a cozy old school kind of burger place. Onion rings are delicious and they have amazing souvlaki. The guys there are all cool to chat with and make you want to come back. They aren't cheap with the portions either, plate will be stacked to the top and burger is so big it's hard to get a good bite. A+ I love this place"}
{"text":"It's basically the west end equivalent of SquareBoy. But the burgers are slightly better. Prices are definitely great! You can't get better food at a cheaper price. Will hit the spot everytime. Oh, and the fries also on point."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend, we had cheeseburgers and split a onion rings. Food was great and filling. Decent enough patty. Onion rings were super fresh.   Nice older gentlemen working the till.  Attracts all sorts of people."}
{"text":"Onion rings were great.  As for burgers,  very blend,  pretty sure they are frozen. I found the prices high for low quality.  Service is good but doesn't justify how unclean this burger joint is.  I think small renovations might help the place look a bit cleaner.  Personally I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Nice simple burger joint with an authentic old school ambience. Had the burger and onion rings. Burger was big for the price but a bit bland (salt?).  Bring cash. Doesnt accept debit or credit."}
{"text":"Not what it appears! This place looks antiquated and mediocre. The food; however, was excellent! Juicy homemade burger with fresh toppings. It was a great burger and I will be returning frequently! It's also the only decent place open late in the area on some days."}
{"text":"December 2nd, 11:50 pm  Extremely dirty place. Authorities should lock down this place. He has frozen fries outside in room temperature to have them ready to fry as also onion rings. Hamburger bun burned! Souvlaki bun too. Both no taste at all. Unflavored meat. Be careful the guy gives back wrong changes, maybe he thinks only junkies coming late....Just stay away."}
{"text":"Maybe its the fact that there's Apache burger near my place or the fact that this was a total disappointment, but this the burger was indeed paperthin and the onion rings over salted.  Much left to be desired.  Perhaps if I was inhebriated on a Friday night I could give it another try, but that's highly unlikely.  I had to ask twice to get a single piece of lettuce on that badboy (the excuse for a cheese burger)"}
{"text":"Burger, cheeseburger, fries, onion rings and a milkshake for just about $20!  This place is great value when you want a burger. Cooked to order and got just what you want for burgers.  The fries were delicious. Onion rings I felt had a bit too much batter. And the milkshake, not you fancy ones but it's decent.  Next time I want burgers, this is my go to. Not fancy and not a $10/$20 burger, just simple stuff for great price."}
{"text":"Go here, don't walk...run! Best burgers in Toronto. They are always busy so everything is fresh. Really nice old school burger joint, nothing fancy, just good. Cash only is a small downside but no big deal."}
{"text":"Pretty dece - wonderful decor, gorgeous tiles, surprisingly flattering lighting. Burgs are dece - generous toppings and patties aren't too ravaged and charred to bits. Overheard on my first visit a longtime patron (a large possibly drunk man) say he'd been coming since 1972, and \"I don't eat Jumbo... I make LOVE to it.\""}
{"text":"A local staple. Great burgers, fantastic onion rings, and a friendly staff. The place is cash only, but they do have an atm onsite."}
{"text":"A really great diner burger spot. There's nothing terrible 'special' about this place, but it's one of the few places left in the city that will feed you a real burger for under five dollars. Portions, both burger and fries, are large and onion rings are crisp and tasty.  Staff behind the counter can seem a bit cold at first, but they seem to warm up to a smile rather quickly. There is seating in the restaurant, but it is not plentiful, although you probably won't feel too cramped.   The one real downside to Jumbo Burger is being located in the proverbial 'middle of nowhere', too far to walk from Bloor Village West, the Junction, or most of the small communities around St Clair. But if you're in the neighbourhood, or don't mind taking a bus to access it, Jumbo Burger is a dying breed of cheap eat, quality burgers."}
{"text":"This is a typical greasy spoon joint. The food is average, nothing special."}
{"text":"Old fashioned burgers, fresh not frozen. Grilled raw on their grill and made with classic toppings. Patties were a bit overcooked but their fries made up for it. Environment is like taking a step back into the 70's!"}
{"text":"Banquet burger, onion rings, root beer.   Bacon is grilled.   Malt vinegar available.   Delicious."}
{"text":"This has got to be the best $4 burger in Toronto. Lets make sure we are clear on the 5 stars rating. This is the best for the price I have had better but closer to $12."}
{"text":"Old school burger joint, with simple flame grilled burgers (home made beef patties, not frozen) and amazing onion rings.  If you like your onion rings made in house with batter, not breadcrumbs, this is the place for you.  Greasy, crunchy, tasty onion ring goodness takes me back to the 70's!  Fries are also made fresh in house, but aren't as crispy as the onion rings, but still great.  Cash only, and run by 2 old guys, like so many great, old school places are."}
{"text":"It is what it is.. An old school burger joint  Do not and I repeat do not get the fish and chips!!! They batter and deep fry the fish days, weeks before and \"re-heat\" the fish when you order it!?!? This is sacrilege!!!  The burgers are okay.. The fries are fresh cut and okay."}
