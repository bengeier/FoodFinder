{"text":"Come here for the food, it's the best pizza we've found in Calgary.
Nicest people run the place, we drive from a distance just for their pizza. Varsity Pizza, please never change!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around!!!  We order from here all of the time. Cheap prices. Quick service."}
{"text":"Really not worth it. Not even a good hole in the wall. Tasteless wimpy slices. I was hoping for a good little find but this was a disappointment"}
{"text":"Was in the neighbourhood so I stopped by for a Donair pizza ($12.75 M). Not my favourite texture and was a bit on the dry and tasteless side, but a decent crust and a good amount of cheese for people who like thicker pizzas. Friendly staff though, will be back to try their subs."}
{"text":"If you went to U of C for a few years then you had to have learned about Varsity Subs.  When I used to go here it was run by an older couple who seemed to have been running the same specials since the '60s.  The subs are absolutely loaded with a ridiculous amount of meat and I remember them costing about $5 for a footlong.  The pizzas are greasy but delicious and also priced from the Great Depression.  I'm not a huge Hawaiian fan but I used to love it from here.  Too bad its so far away or else I'd still be a regular.  I'll probably go back in time for my mid-life crisis."}
{"text":"They make a decent pie for a good price.  Fed 11 people for less than 60 bucks.  Good crisp crust that isn't too thin with nice amount of toppings and cheese.  Good selection of available halal meats for those that need it."}
{"text":"way back in the late 90s when i was in jr high, hundreds of students would make the 1150hrs pilgrimage to this place for $1.25 slices (pepperoni only). the slices were warm and so greasy, it made the tin-foil wrapping on each slice translucent. 

this place still has GREAT greasy pie. their hawaiian is AMAZING. they seem to be under new management and their pie has gotten a bit weird (it's the sauce) but it's still good dough, cheese, and ingredients.

and for lunch? you can still get a foot long sub and a pop for less than $6. i don't know how much their lunch slices are, i'd imagine $2 or something. crappy hours, but when the place is run by a Greek mom-and-pop, i'm fine with it."}
{"text":"5 stars.
Best pizza in Calgary, hands down. Also, by far the best price. We love supporting this little business."}
{"text":"Best Pizza ever!
I moved to Edmonton and everytime I come back to Calgary I have to go get a slice of that delicious pizza. Haven't found one good enough to even compare to it.

Is it bad that they know my group of friends names? Maybe we go there too much. Can't help it!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza here, especially the \"Varsity Special\". The service is always excellent and the prices are pretty decent for the quality you get. I wish they were open later and on Sundays though as there have been a couple times we wanted pizza past 10pm or on a Sunday night but all in all our favourite pizza place and we are loyal customers"}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE TO DIE FOR!! super yummy, delicio, yummy yummy yummy!!! 
Worth the drive to pick up. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Recently moving to the NW, I have realized that there are a lot of options for pizza, varying from very-good to cardboard with sauce and cheese. One of my favourite pizza joints thus far is Varsity Pizza & Subs.

It's not a huge place, so I suggest takeout or delivery over eating there, but as I recall there is some seating. The pizza is good, with plenty of cheese, a golden crust and, thankfully, at a decent price. A medium Pep/Bacon will run you something like $10.50- that's pretty darn good for above average pizza.

The Delivery, in my experience is quick (I do live close) and there was no waiting or quilting me into a tip (obviously I gave him one anyway,). On top of that, unlike Pizza 73, I didn't see any mandatory delivery charge on the bill..

I can't speak to the subs, but if the pizza and garlic bread say anything, you'll likely be more than happy."}
{"text":"We just moved to Varsity and had no idea where the great pizza was in that area.  We lucked out on the first place we tried.  Our pizzas were quick to arrive and oh..so tasty.  We will definitely be ordering from Varsity Pizza again."}
{"text":"This is a true in the hole pizza and sub experience but there is one item on the menu that keeps me coming back. The donair sub is a unique creation that fuses giro meat with typical submarine ingredients and donair sauce. 

If you live in the NW and have never tried this place, stop by one evening if you're driving through. You'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"This pizza place forgot my pineapples on a ham and pineapple with donair and olives... The cheese was crusty but not golden, and it smelled strange.  I was only offered a $5 off coupon for my next visit, not a new pizza, which I wouldn't want to go pick up anyway.

The last time I had a boring sub here that made me wish I had gone to Subway.  

For being a Pizza and Sub joint, I expected some effort and  what I paid for, getting neither.  I tipped them for a failed pizza.  And for that I will give them a bad review on three different sites.  Don't mess with a guys pineapples on a rainy Saturday..

The restaurant looks old school and grimey.  Not coming back."}
