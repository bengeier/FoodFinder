{"text":"Overall, a great place to eat.  However, the one negative on JT Walkers is they serve THE WEAKEST mixed drinks we have ever had.  I seriously wonder if they even put alcohol in them.  We have experienced this on numerous occasions, both in the main dining room and upstairs with a number of different bartenders.  Its discouraging to pay $6+ for a drink and get syrup and flavored fillers.  On the positive side, they have expanded their craft beer selection and have a very nice selection both draft and bottle.  They also have a great appetizer selection and all are excellent.  Their entree selection is fair and needs rotated.  However, we have been pleased with the quality and quantity of food we have had.  If JT would take a lesson from Boltini's and serve a quality mixed drink he would deserve a 5-star rating."}
{"text":"Food is hit or miss, as is the staff in the downstairs part of the restaurant.  Once they recognize you, they are friendlier.  Staff upstairs at the bar is helpful and friendly.  Best \"bar\" in Mahomet."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed for these owners. Service is awful which in return, makes the entire experience unpleasant. The team needs major education in Customer Service and kindness.   There were two of us going in for lunch at 12:53pm on a Wednesday 11/15 .... in Mahomet, IL not a major city. The sign stated: \"seat yourself\" ... it should say: seat yourself at your own risk and be prepared for ignorance. Something to note, no one even greeted us and both servers were on their phone behind the bar. Unfortunately not a surprise these days.    I shouldn't need to make excuses, but I had surgery yesterday so needed a bit more room to be comfortable since the two tops are rather small. Especially when you have other items with you. No biggie, right?  There was an 8 top that was easily split between two four tops, if you follow, so we sat there- a four top. One side booth, the other two chairs. Still a table of four on the left.   Right next to us was a larger 6 top table (potential for 8 top) who currently had two adults and a small young adorable 3 y.o.- let's call them 2.5 people. I'd estimate 15 mins. Left on there table. They had food, little boy was done with his food and playing in the booth.   This becomes important because the server came over and told us (with no greeting btw) that we can't sit there. We're not allowed. She threatened that if a large party comes in she will move us mid-meal. She repeated herself 3x's, with attitude.  I thought to myself:   1. Don't blow up.   2. Being in the field for 20 years, never would I be so ignorant and disrespectful to paying customers, let alone in a town this small.   3. Patronage is everything. Also, that I would be smart enough to figure out a new seating plan for those hypothetical 10 people. Problem solving skills is apparently few and far between these days.  I felt like sharing a few key points and educating her on business; then I figured she didn't deserve my time or knowledge.   We walked out and will never return. Nor will any party we have ever had there. Her counter part behind the bar hung her head and mouthed \"I'm sorry\" on the way out.   Truly disappointed. This place has potential and great atmosphere.   Also, kudos to whomever reads this novel."}
{"text":"Burgers taste frozen, dry. Gone mutiple times and tried to order whatever special of the day they had and everytime they are sold out. Wait staff didn't even appologise. Fairly good beer selection for small town bar but don't recomend counting on taking in a meal here. Tater skins ok to snack on but if you don't make it before 7p.m. most likely they're gonna run out of what I would guess would be the menu's more tastier items."}
{"text":"Excellent gem in a small town- great menu, nice selection of beers and seating outside!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Mahomet and I am excited to have a place like this in such a small town. Been there a few times during the move. The beer they brew is delicious, the food is timely and really well priced for the quality, and the service has been wonderful each time. Really like the upstairs bar as well. We will be returning very soon I am sure!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious, beer was awesome and the customer service was great!  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the food and staff. Try the chicken quesadilla appetizer and the pulled pork sandwich w sweet potato fries!!!! Soooo good! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and a very nice atmosphere...especially for atown as small as Mahomet. A bit $$ but not terribly unreasonable."}
{"text":"I would prefer to rate the brewery and restaurant separately, but that doesn't seem to be an option.  So here's the breakdown:  Brewery: 4.5 stars.  Excellent and innovative beers that are well-executed.  The brewery space is pretty nice - open and with shuffleboard and darts.  I liked every beer I had; the bourbon-barrel aged porter was surprisingly balanced.  Many times the bourbon just overwhelms the beer, but it really worked together.  The Kentucky Common is also delightful; a dark sour that's not too tart to drink a lot of.  It's also a very uncommon style, making it a nice surprise.  My only complaint about the brewery is that they were out of some beers and I would've liked to try them. No big worry, though.  Restaurant: 2.5 stars.  Based on the other reviews, we avoided the burgers.  I got the wings, which were recommended by multiple people, the fried pickles (also recommended), and my wife got the seared tuna wrap.  You order wings by the pound, which is an interesting way of saying that you get 6 wings for $10.50.  They were very meaty, large wings, but they were already a little soggy by the time they got to the table.  In fairness, that may have been because they had to be boxed up and taken to the brewery across the street - the main restaurant was full.  The sauce (spicy buffalo) was fine but not too remarkable.    In general, I really like fried pickles.  They are one of my favorite fried foods.  The saltiness of the pickles goes great with a light, crispy batter.  Here, we got pickles with a very thick batter, like most onion rings.  There was probably more batter mass than pickle on each one.  The result was too heavy and not very good.  Until now, I had not met a fried pickle that I did not enjoy.  My wife's seared tuna was seared.  It was then cooked further, to about well done.  Seared generally implies that the outside is cooked and the inside not so much.  The quality of the tuna was pretty good; it's a shame that it was cooked so thoroughly.    For the ratings, I took the average of the two and rounded up.  Overall, absolutely go for beers.  I'd eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Nice place!  The grilled cheese was amazing. The turkey burger was also very good as was the house burger.  Nice ambiance.  Service was friendly.  Free wifi, nice selection of beer on tap and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Their food is fantastic. Great atmosphere and fantastic selection of beers. Their brews are also quite tasty, and they seem to experiment quite a lot. Great salads !"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding, and I'm still on the first floor!!! Try the cajun chicken pasta!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.   Great food.   Great beer.   Great service.   Such an awesome place to have in Mahomet.   Friday night crowd was huge,  but we got to wait for our table across the street in the brewery and try some of their beers out.  Hostess called when the table was ready.   Great place!"}
{"text":"Food is ok for what it is  and the beer selection is pretty good.  Service is ok and the kitchen keeps up when it's busy but if you make a reservation there is less than a 50 % chance they will have it when you walk in the door. This makes this place bush league in my opinion. If you call and make a reservation and you speak to the owner and it can't be found when you arrive?  Give me a break.  This happened to me two out of three times now."}
{"text":"TJWalker's. I went with a group of friends Friday night. We got there around 9:30pm and wanted beer from the brewery. We had cream stout, which is an amazing beer. Creamy, rich, yet still bright. So good.   We decided to order food. I went over and stood at the bar with a friend. We waited and waited and waited. The bartender looked right at us, through us is a better word. We were two invisible girls to him. Was he having a bad day? His name was Kyle and he must be the only bartender that hates tips. Because he walked off without even recognizing we were there. (I think to get a glass for another lady siting at the bar) I had to walk over to a waitress that shooed us away saying \"oh he'll help you\" towards the bar. I let her know no one was there, but that didn't seem to be her problem. She was busy talking with a coworkers and folding napkins for the mostly empty bar. When he finally returned we got to place orders after he finished along sure everyone else sitting had what they needed. Our orders were taken half heartedly and begrudgingly. There was another younger guy working. He was very friendly had so helpfully. He walked out food over to the brewery once it was ready and make a few jokes with us. His help brightens the experience.   Our food: I had the TJ Horseshoe. It was about half the size I was expecting and had about half the cheese, which made it dry. As a born and bred Illinois girl, not impressed. My friend has the California burger. She really loved her food! It was fresh, flavorful and a good amount of food. My fianc√© has the sausage and mushroom pasta. He loved it had still talked about how amazing it was. This we would buy again.   So to sum up. Service here need a serious improvement... But the food and beer are very good!   Only 3 stars because I would rather drink in Champaign, have the wait and crowds than pay to be ignored."}
{"text":"Missed our Champaign/Urbana exit, and decided to just stop in the next town, Mahomet, where we found JT Walker's!  It was a happy accident! The atmosphere is charming and welcomimg, and the staff is so friendly.  We got Dog Pound Fries as an appetizer- they were delicious and hit the spot.  Our sandwiches were excellent.  We'll be back on our trips from Indiana to Minnesota."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to eat with in a 20 min drive.  The food is fresh. The menu has a good selection.  I would like to see it change more.  The best part of JT Walkers is the beer selection.  Their micro beers are very good and when you need to try something new, they offer a fantastic selection from other breweries as well.  People are always nice and service has always been great."}
{"text":"Came here the other day with my boyfriend. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which to my surprise was very good. My boyfriend ordered a pretzel burger which also looked mighty tasty. We also enjoyed a beer flight which is a choice of 4 different beers in shot glasses served on a platter. Their drink menu was incredibly impressive and went on for multiple pages.   The rooftop eating along with their extensive drink menu is why I am rating them so highly. I enjoyed being able to eat outside and overlook the lovely town of Mahomet. The service on the other hand was far from good in my opinion.   It took them about 7 minutes before they noticed that we hadn't been helped. She proceeded to ask us what we wanted before either of us even got a menu. After we ordered we waited for our brushetta which came out as potato skins because our waitress put in the order wrong. Because of that we ended up with our food at the same time as appetizers. Throughout the rest of the meal our waitress managed to let the f bomb and s bomb slip out and make an appearance which was far from professional.   Luckily their food, ambiance, and drink menu is enough to get me to overlook their lack of good service and return in the near future."}
{"text":"This is confusing to say the least. JT walkers restaurant and brewery? The brewery is across the street. No real food however, bartender and popcorn make up for it. We went across the street for apps and more beer. It was around 445pm. The lady working behind the bar and also waitressing (?) was so completely rude. She also made it clear that they do not carry all the beers from across the street. She even added that they pay shipping/delivery charges for beer. When we asked for specific beers that we had at JT walkers breweries, she looked at us like we were stupid. Then replied why would I know what you are talking about?! I simply said that they carried it across the street. She then let me know that they are 2 different businesses. She was so rude to us and proceeded to walk away!  Meanwhile people kept coming in. Most of them in pajama pants, had plastic cups, singing and dancing to music on their phones. Oh wait! They weren't customers! They proceeded to go behind the bar and fill up there cups while talking and dancing with the waitress/bartender. Meanwhile, I went to use the restroom and had to walk through the female waitresses that were cleaning the silverware prior to starting their shift. All they did was talk crap about some girl who was working there and their manager.   This place has the potential to be something amazing. However, the confusion of which place is which and the rude bartender/waitress prior to dinner service makes it a failure."}
{"text":"My old stomping grounds!  I used to take dance classes upstairs here.  Hard to believe it's a bar up there now.  It looks great!! I wouldn't want to try to navigate the stairs after a few though.  They have an outside rooftop patio that looks really cool to go out on in nicer weather.  My friend and I shared the chicken wrap and the three tacos.  the tacos were pretty good but I thought the wrap was just so so.  I was with a group of people and a lot of them ordered salads which looked really good.  Next time I go I will try a salad and write an update."}
{"text":"Food was excellent every time I've been here and I usually order something different.  My fiancee loves the ribs --  I'm actually surprised this place only got 4 Star rating (which is still pretty good).  The service is excellent, food is great (and consistent), and there is never a wait although the place never seems dead (at least when we go).  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"LOTS of beer choices including their own brew.  12 oz. House October fest beer is 4.50.  We had 2 house burgers with sweet potato fries and deep fried asparagus.  Tasty.  Our bill was 34 so with tip you will spend about 41.  Decent atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"So first of all, my rating is ONLY for our waitress. The food was a Five all the way! The kitchen staff had it out quick. It wasn't too busy, but busy enough for a sunday, probably because it was Father's Day.   Anyway, our waitress was Debra. She didn't seem very personable, kind of like she had a lot of other things on her mind, our table wasn't the first. She took our order, almost like she was doing us a favor. After taking it and walking away, she came back and asked us to repeat everything we ordered because she couldn't remember. Not a huge deal, but she seemed annoyed with US for it. Our food came out, and I realized I didn't have the ranch I asked for with my wrap. She rolled her eyes, but brought me some. We then noticed her fingernails had dirt completely CAKED under them, and her hands didn't really look like they'd been washed in a while either. I'm not one to judge, but if you're a server, COME ON! Hygiene is extremely important!!   All in all, it was an okay experience. We were all kind of grossed out after noticing that, after being a little frustrated with how we were being treated. We all love the food there, so we'll probably come back. We just might have to request another waitress."}
{"text":"Went with husband for dinner on a Saturday night. Arrived around 5:30 and got right in, but it filled up fast right after. I had the BBQ on pretzel roll with a side of Mac and cheese. It was really good! Love the Mac and cheese (the side is not the same as the Mac and cheese entree). Husband had nachos and they were excellent. Added a side of queso and made them even better. Onion rings were tasty with a great dipping sauce. Tried the beer flight. Our favorite was Bulldog. Least favorite was Hail to the Chief.  Can't wait to to back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food and normally terrible service. I only come here because it is close to my house and there aren't many options. Last time I came here on a Sunday afternoon with my family, we ended up leaving because we were never acknowledged by the server. She was happy to ask all 4-5 of the bar patrons if they needed another drink but didn't care to even look in our direction. Walking out from behind the bar must have taken too much effort. We come for drinks on occasion and the service at the bar has always been decent in the evenings. Being in Mahomet, this place could do so much better. But they need to train their service staff and have a manager who pays attention to the floor. I have NEVER been greeted by a manager or have even seen a manager there. Ever."}
{"text":"It is still strange to me to have a bar on Main Street in Mahomet, considering how long the village was dry. But it is a great place for a small town. I had my 10 year high school reunion here and always meet up with friends when I am home for the holidays. The food is great, the beer list is fantastic for any bar (but especially impressive considering its location), the decor is well done, and great entertainment options."}
{"text":"I went in for dinner at 5pm on a Thursday night.   The restaurant was empty except for one table of 5.  The restaurant was a bit on the cold side so I sat near the fire place.   The waitresses were friendly.   The menu consisted of your typical \"upscale pub fare\", such as burgers, appetizers, salads, pastas, entrees, and a daily special.   I didn't want to venture too far off into the entree land, so with it being central IL and a \"pub\", I got the black jack burger.   It had pepper jack, a spicy aioli, fried jalapenos, and the usual lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.   It came with fries, but I opted to get the fruit cup.  The burger was supposed to come med-well, but it was more like well done when I got it.... so maybe ask for medium if you like your burger a bit more juicy.   I liked the bun -- it was toasted just the right amount. The pickle was limp but it still had crunch.... they were very generous with the red onions, so I suffered with severe onion breath for quite a few hours.   But all in all the burger was pretty good.  My only complaint was that the waitresses never told me what the specials were -- even though I heard them mention it to other tables as more customers were seated.... they didn't fill my water glass at all, and they failed to ask if I wanted dessert (which I did because of my new found onion breath)...they just brought me the check and said that they'd take it when I was ready.   Yes, I could've spoken up, but since it was my first time here, I wanted to see what the service was really like.   By the time I left, the restaurant was 1/2 full.... and several patrons headed upstairs to the sports bar.  Anyway, I guess this is the best restaurant in Mahomet..... but that's only because of the other restaurants are McDonalds, Subway, and Arbys....... so I guess it's like bragging that you're the world's tallest \"little person\".   So take it for what it is.... not great, but it's a pretty good restaurant if you don't feel like cooking...."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location, good food, great beer, cozy atmosphere.   Pastas are the best thing on the menu. It's all good, but the pastas are to die for - all of them."}
{"text":"After seeing good reviews we decided to make this our pre Illini basketball stop for food and beers. Hit the upstairs sports bar which was laid out well for our group if 8. Started with the JT Walker wheat brew and chorizo stuffed mushrooms which were awesome. Service was as well as could be expected on a busy night. Service was friendly but sometimes you had to be on the offense to get their attention. I had the pretzel burger with fries. Burger seemed small on the bun but was adequate the spicy Aoli on top was nice. Not the best burger I ever had but not bad. Plenty of TVs for sports viewing and good food we will return."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner last week and had a totally different service experience. The   young man working at the bar ( i believe his name was Jake) was very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. He had a good working knowledge of the menu and was able to suggest items he preferred. Most of all, he took ownership of the  guest experience from beginning  to the end.  Glad to see that the service is now matching the quality of food. Will gladly return"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, very quiet and comfortable. Got the sweet chili chicken wrap with fries and the chicken was very good, large portions of chicken within the wrap. Excellent fries, good service, friendly employees"}
{"text":"Small town delivers big hit!  Yes, it's a bar...but the food was great!  We visited on a Sunday afternoon with four adults and four children, and everyone left happy and slightly bulging.  The deep-fried mushrooms were done excellently...and the Italian Beef was on par with the best I've had...good for a well done stomach-filling.  The other dishes looked good and disappeared faster than that bunny rabbit that has been lurking around my garden!  I was pleasantly surprised to see how nicely everything was plated.   fyi:  The kids mac-n-cheese is of the 'kraft out of the box' variety, however, if you order mac-n-cheese as a side, it is of the 'made in the kitchen' variety!  We loved the interior brick on the walls, the ceiling, and the wood furniture. It had just enough of an 'old world' feeling to it without going overboard.  I'd love to visit again for an evening dinner with just a date...but that, will have to wait!"}
{"text":"I've been to JT's for lunch, dinner and drinks more times than I can count.  I've never had a meal I wasn't satisfied with.  The servers and bartenders are very friendly, but the wait can sometimes be longer than desired.  The cocktail list is extensive and drinks are reasonably priced.    My go-to JT's dish: Greek salad or Reuben Cocktail: The Speed Walker  I love sitting upstairs on the cozy couches by the windows.  They also have live bands a few times a month.  It can get a little noisy and crowded on those nights, but it's always a good time!"}
{"text":"I live in Champaign and this was a nice change for us.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great bartenders, great beer options, and amazing food!  We plan to go more frequently, that's for sure!  The bartender upstairs on our first visit was super friendly and great at helping us try new beers, all of which we loved. The dinner menu is huge, so many great options knowing they are all really good.  A nice problem to have. We started with the bone-in chicken wings, which I normally never get but these were hands down, the best. wings. ever.  We did sauce on the side and you really dont need any because the flavor and spice on them is perfect. And they are not small! I had the italian beef and polenta fries, both of which were fantastic.  It's hard to find any kind of italian beef in the C-U area and this worked for me (although my favorite is still Portillo's!).  My husband got the Ribeye Steak sandwich and loved it.  I was pleased to see that they sold my favorite wines, from Alto Vineyards.  Big plus for me! This is our new favorite place. I highly recommend it for a date night or a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"We walked in there and got rude looks from people. The waitress clearly saw us, but did not come by at all. Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Every time I've had the pleasure of visiting Mahomet, I've ended up at JT Walkers. And this isn't an accident. Very friendly bar staff, good local beers on tap, and a multitude of bar games to keep patrons occupied. Oh yeah, and the food is great."}
{"text":"Not impressed, prices were excessively high for below average product, the burgers were dry and lacking flavor, seems like they're up charging for presentation and stiffing customers on product quality.  As a home gourmet I expected a much better food quality while walking through the restaurant  and looking at other guests plates. The rooftop seating was nice on a warm sunny day, but all in all this isn't a place I'm likely to return to."}
{"text":"Food was good. We had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken Wrap which was ok. I'm not a big fan of wraps, but I ordered it anyway, it was more sweet than spicy. I had the friend polenta, which is what you got. I asked for parmesan cheese and olive oil to put on the polenta fries, which made them much more flavorful. The appetizer of fried mushrooms was delicious as well as the chips and salsa. My daughters enjoyed the mac and cheese. The beer selection was good. I was hoping the wait staff  would have been more informed about the beers brewed by JT Walkers. Wait staff was ok, nothing spectacular. Could be better."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great servers, and good beer. So happy to have this type of establishment in a \"small\" town. I've had a surprise  baby shower here (who expects to have a baby shower and a brewery...right?!), hosted meetings, ladies nights out, date nights and family dinners. It's not particularly a family restaurant but it's not horrible.  I love the polenta fries!!! with ranch! I'd never considered it and BAM... here you are.   I've been disappointed with the dessert options... the ones i've tried seemed to just come from a box... not be made in house (a peanut butter pie and a banana fosters cake).   Over all, I like the place and enjoy meeting people there for a bite or drink."}
{"text":"Burgers are fresh. Excellent beer menu including some they brew across the street. Don't go for lunch expecting lunch prices as everything is a bit pricey. Atmosphere and decor is excellent. Definitely a place to visit as the items are prepared fresh."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly pleased with this little gem a few years ago and it's only gotten better!!! I had a great cheeseburger and awesome mixed drinks. Such great atmosphere. It's so nice to be able to hear the people you are dining with!!!  I would have given it five stars but I just don't hand those out too easily ;P That said. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Pretty restaurant.   Excellent polenta fries.  Everything else was above-average pub grub.  The waitress was awful. Cold as ice and pissed off at the world."}
{"text":"What a surprise in such a tiny little town. The decor was historic but hip, staff was young and friendly. Great beer and other cocktails, but food was the biggest surprise. We had asian chicken and Mexican lunch salads - fresh, high quality ingredients, well-prepared, we will definitely make a stop here again!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend. I got the pretzel burger, my girlfriend got a pulled pork sandwich, and we got bruschetta and chips and salsa for appetizers.  The pretzel burger was delicious, the pulled pork sandwich was delicious, the chips and salsa was some of the best I've ever had, and the bruschetta was also very delicious.  The beer menu was extensive and I particularly enjoyed the beer trip-type thing (4 beers in shot glasses). The food and drink and ambiance is worth 5 stars, but the service was slow and our waitress had a potty mouth, saying such classics such as the f-word and another word for doo-doo, all within a 15 minute timespan.  I didn't catch her name, but if you read this, Waitress, you really need to watch your fucking mouth.  I'll come again."}
{"text":"I had heard such good things about this place that I had to try it.  A friend and I stopped here for dinner before a movie.  Super easy to find, cool older building.  We ordered the fried pickles with both regular ranch and the chipotle ranch dressings.  Can I just say that I have never tasted a better pickle in my life?  The breaking was not too heavy.  I ordered the \"grown up\" mac & cheese and my friend ordered the steak Alfredo.  Mine was one of the best Mac & cheese dishes I have had.  It had mushrooms, green onions and bacon in it.  So much that I was only able to eat about 1/4 of the serving.  The steak Alfredo was delicious as well - just a bit too much fresh basil, but it was easy to take it off to your liking.  Neither of us are beer drinkers, however, we did stop across the street at the brewery to check it out.  Overall, a great experience.  Good service, good atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"We're local to Mahomet, so we go to JT Walkers fairly often.  There aren't too many other dine-in restaurants in town.  The food is decent for a decent price.  The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed, clean and attractive but not fancy.    The downstairs is the restaurant and the upstairs is the bar, but there's a bar downstairs and food upstairs, so you won't lose out either way.  Kids fit right in at the restaurant. There are a small number of tables down the sides, with a couple of long bench tables in the center, near a fireplace. You can watch closed caption tvs hanging on the walls while you eat.  There are daily specials, which bring the price down a little. Some are good.  Some aren't as good.  The fried chicken has a very sweet coating that isn't to our taste. The adult mac and cheese is terrific when made correctly, with bacon and shrooms. The ribeye steak sandwich is also a hit.  Hamburgers, too, are good and made with a variety of toppings. Choose your entree based on what this kind of neighborhood bar spot does well. Salads are so-so, and as are many of the sides, like the roasted corn relish. But onion rings are delish. A lot of the food quality depends on whether the kitchen has a good night or not -- sometimes things are prepared correctly and sometimes they are not.  Not that long ago, JT Walkers added a Sunday breakfast option. They had no toast / bagel / English muffin to go with -- no bread. The rest was so-so.  We didn't try again."}
{"text":"For a small town like Mahomet, this is a surprise.  A decent steak and sandwich shop with a nice decor.  Our food was well-prepared, served by high school student-type waitstaff, in a friendly atmosphere where everyone seems to know everyone else. Worth a visit if you are stuck in Mahomet. Free Wi-Fi"}
{"text":"JT Walker's is a great place to grab some food in Mahomet. The food is always good and appeals to a wide variety of interests. I'm a big fan of the sweet chili chicken wrap, but I have never gotten anything there they didn't enjoy. The decor is simple yet inviting. The wait staff is friendly and helpful.   What really separates JT's (as the locals call it) apart from the rest is it's beer selection. They have an amazing selection and best of all they have many of them on tap. The taps change with the season and represent many great micro brews which constantly rotate with the season. If there is something you haven't heard of before, the bar tenders really know there stuff and can recommend something based off of your tastes. They also offer beer flights (or the sampler as I like to call it).   This is a great location to bring a date."}
{"text":"I love coming to JT Walker's on Thursday's for trivia. The beer is arguably the best in central IL. The service is consistently excellent. And the food is far better than one would expect at a brewery. I highly recommend the ribs if you're coming on Thursday, they are phenomenal and fall right off the bone, can easily be eaten with a fork. Their beer cheese soup is also incredible, as are the danger fries. Just don't eat chili fries, beer cheese soup, buffalo chicken, and beer all at once or you'll develop heartburn that you never knew was possible. I make the drive from Champaign whenever I can because it's truly worth it."}
{"text":"food is good. the service is average at best. the upstairs is not clean. I think they need more people working at one time or maybe just a little better management to stay on top of small things that people can see. I will go back and try again."}
{"text":"They have the best food. I went here when I came to visit a friend and I have been dying to come back to have the pasta I had here. Such good flavor!"}
{"text":"Everything I've tried here has been tasty, especially liked the chips and salsa and salads. My friend ordered the chimichanga and loved it! It was huge and had lots of chicken, peppers and cheese. Relaxing atmosphere, clean restaurant and the upstairs bar area has a cool vibe if you're looking to enjoy a cocktail."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! I always come for either the buffalo chicken wrap, or the adult mac & cheese with grilled chicken."}
{"text":"So I found this place one time when i was needing to kill some time driving around, looked like a neat place so I decided that my wife and I could go back sometime and have drinks/food sometime. Well that time came and the two of us plus a couple of friends met for dinner. First of all I really like the look of the place-if I were to have a restaurant/bar this would pretty much be what I would design it to look like. Secondly I really like their vast beer selection, the bartenders now how to make a drink-all that is good. Service was top notch, we never had a point where we were hunting for a server. Now, for the food-I gotta say was pretty much a disappointment. I felt as if we were eating good cafeteria food. I got the pork chop the was to have some sort of horseradish sauce covering it and then have green beans with bacon and shaved parm  and red skin mashed potatoes on the side. (most of the entrees had this as the side). First the chop was boneless and was to be roasted though it seemed as if it had been on the grill (which I wouldn't have minded) but the cut of the chop wasn't even so I had one side that was thick cooked medium and the smaller side was thinner and cooked well. Now I don't mind a medium pork chop, I prefer it actually but lets be consistent here. I asked for the horseradish sauce on the side and i'm glad I did as it was cold almost like a salad dressing. Okay flavor but I wouldn't want it smothering my chop.  Secondly the green beans were obviously canned. They threw some bacon bits on top, some pre-grated parm on top and voila, right? The potatoes were probably the best part with the exception that they were a bit runny and needed some salt and pepper added. The potatoes bled into both the chop and the beans and I'm not a fan of all my food co-mingled prior to entering my stomach. The food wasn't so bad that I couldn't eat it, it was as I find in a lot of restaurants more often than not (that are not chains) that with very little extra effort (and money) that the food could go from \"Eh\" to \"Wow, this is great!\" Unless JT is having some major financial troubles and trying to stay afloat, I would say a little extra effort is needed. We will probably go back eventually but I'll be a little choosier as to what I get. I really hope this place takes a few cues from my suggestions and goes forward."}
{"text":"This was our 3rd time there and we were not as impressed as the 1st time. When we arrived there were not many people in the restaurant except at the bar, and it took awhile to be waited on. The waitress was less than motivated and everything just took awhile. REfills were awhile coming or didn't come. I think the consenus of the others around else felt the same bc everyone is looking around, \"Where is my server?\" The food is pretty good. I'd say the chicken wrap should be chunks of chicken not shredded chicken. That was kinda cheap to me. Also the kids meals are okay priced. But to add fruit is extra. We can go to Desthil and get a full size hamburger with fruit or fries and a drink for the same price.  I don't think we will rush back."}
{"text":"JT's is much better than it used to be! Living here for years we used to always shrug it off and not come back after having mediocre meals. Well after trying it again a few times recently they seemed to have figured it out. Solid burgers and wraps, a nice drink selection, and a trendy ambiance help to make this a solid choice if you're in mahomet!"}
{"text":"JT Walker's is a surprisingly good restaurant and microbrewery, not what you'd expect in a little burgh like Mahomet. The restaurant takes full advantage of the old building in which it is situated, giving it an authentic yet modern vibe. Beers are the main reason to visit JT's. They have several of their own concoctions on offer, including the Orange and Blue (wheat beer) and Hail to the Chief (IPA) both names drawing inspiration from the nearby University of Illinois. There's also a good selection of other craft beers if you want some variety. Fried pickles make a nice companion to your beverages.  I've enjoyed both lunch and dinner here, including the burgers, fish fry, and salads. My favorite salad is the black and blue, grilled steak and bleu cheese on a bed of romaine lettuce. Some items are misses though; their Mac n' cheese was disappointing, coming out a bland, oily mess. Fortunately, most of the choices I have had were very good.  The atmosphere is lively without being overwhelming and service is attentive too. This is a wonderful option for a business lunch or a casual date. It's probably the best restaurant in town and if you live in Champaign or Urbana, it's well worth the drive. Recommended."}
{"text":"went with my husband several times to attend reunion. Decent bar / restaurant and nice patio/balcony seatings.  Have big jar of long island for $8"}
{"text":"I took my wife to JT Walker's for Valentine's Day, and it was a really nice surprise out in Mahomet. The atmosphere is nice; exposed brick, nice bar, decorated ceiling. Bar options are fantastic; lots of great beer on tap, included Deschutes Red Chair NWPA, which I tried for the first time here and has quickly become my favorite beer of late! Dinner was very good too; I had a wrap and the wife had fish. They may be trying to make the menu a little bit too expansive; there was something available of basically every type, and they possibly could benefit from paring it down a bit. But overall, the food was good, the drinks were good, and the atmosphere was good!"}
{"text":"Tuesday lunch, excellent.  I had Greek salad with soup and my husband had the sweet chili wrap with polenta fries.  Both meals were very good although polenta fries may have been just a little overrated by other reviews.  Would recommend this restaurant for a fantastic lunch."}
{"text":"We love Jt Walker's food! Tonight we had a carry out order. We had an order of dog pound nachos, a personal favorite of my boyfriends. We got home and opened it, and the cheese was, I kid you not, strips of velveeta. Not melted, just big strips piled on top of our chips...they could've at least microwaved it! We were super disappointed."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The food is always top notch and creative. I love the Ahi Tuna salad with the wasabi sauce. Also the \"wraps\" are excellant. Great service with a smile!!! Ask for Amber! She is the best bartender in the Mahomet/Champaign area. Smile on her face and will answer all your questions. The owner is young, fresh and willing to be creative. He plans on opening a micro brewery across the street. Close to the highway so if you are looking for a great place to stop, this is the place."}
{"text":"Burgers tasted frozen and the fried mushrooms dripped grease,,yuck.   Atmosphere is ok.  Service was less than stellar."}
{"text":"What a great find! Chelsea was so friendly and informative, made me feel so comfortable and at ease, but she left the bar at 5 pm and went upstairs to wait tables. Then came \"lurch\" to tend bar, not friendly and looked like he just crawled out of bed, rubbing his eyes and clothing wrinkled! As of 5:30 he hadn't acknowledged me as a customer at his bar! I moved upstairs to a much more friendly area. The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"In town for the fiance's high school reunion- this bar was very surprising, as they have an AMAZING BEER MENU!  I was shocked at how many unique and delicious craft beers this place has- it was wonderful!   I was fortunate to try the special release Schlafly pumpkin ale on draft and it was life-changing :)  They also have a 'coming soon' section on their beer menu with other delicious seasonal varieties---this beer-lover will definitely be making a return visit AND telling all her friends about it!  Also, the food was very tasty (we had the southwest and cobb salad- both were devoured in their entirety) Keep up the good work JTs!"}
{"text":"I must start by saying that the brewery across the street deserves a full 5 star rating - a surprisingly great brewery with a diverse selection! The restaurant on the other hand is just mediocre. I'm happy to see a couple of vegetarian items and that it's not too expensive but it's just okay. But hey, you've got to have something to eat with all that delicious beer so you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"My sister and I headed to JT's for dinner after visiting our dad in Mahomet. At 7:30pm in a Saturday night the place was deserted but we figured people were at the home Illini game.  We ordered a New York strip medium rare. It arrived well-done. They offered to replace it but we were hungry and in a hurry to eat and get home. It was disappointing, flavorless, and basically inedible. More frustrating was that I'd really been looking forward to a good steak and $22 is pretty pricey so they ought to respect the cut of meat and the customers request. They knocked $5 off the bill but trust me when I say it wasn't worth the $17 we were still charged. It ruined the night and our evening out. I think l may look for other options in the future. See photos for images of steak."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here again last night and thought I'd throw in a review. I'm a local so I visit JT's fairly often.   I've never been disappointed with the food. Had the Pretzel Burger last night and it was awesome. (At most restaurants, when they ask you how you want your burger cooked and you say \"Medium\" or \"Well Done\" they'll just come out the same. The burger was a perfect Medium last night.)  As a IPA beer fan, I loved that there were actually choices of IPAs to pick from on the draft menu.   In my opinion you're not going to find better beer selection and food quality at a bar/pub in the Champaign/Urbana area."}
{"text":"I have a very strict diet when it comes to spices and hidden ingredients.  JT's was very accomodating to helping me find a dish that I would enjoy with no garlic or onion added.  They also had good wine recommendations.  Their polenta fries are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and if i weren't on a motorcycle both times, the bar looks awesome too."}
{"text":"I have been to JT's 3 times in the last couple of months. Our experience differs wildly depending on who our waitress is.   The first time I came here, I was impressed with our service. Seven of us were seated downstairs. I got a chicken Caesar salad and it was huge! Generous portions and delicious salad. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food. The drinks took a while to make, but it seemed pretty busy so I didn't think too much about it. The drinks were also really basic without any garnishes. Overall, we had a good time and I would have given that experience four stars.   During my first trip, I had a bite of the lemon chicken pasta and it was out of this world. Decided to come back again a few weeks later because I was craving it! Three of us sat upstairs this time. Our waitress seemed like she had better things to do than focus on our order. We had a couple questions about the menu and rather than patiently answer our questions, she started to walk away after each one and we had to call her back to finish questions and appetizer ordering. We decided to try the wings and chose bone-in wings, which we were specific about. We received boneless and let our waitress know, but she didn't offer to replace them. The nachos and the burger that we ordered were cold. I was the only one at the table satisfied with my food. The lemon chicken pasta was excellent! This experience wasn't as great as the first. The service was bad, but I chose to come back again for the pasta.   The third time, we chose to sit upstairs again. The bartender didn't acknowledge us at all. A frazzled waitress came over to us after we had been there for about ten minutes to take our drink orders, but we hadn't been given menus or even been greeted yet. She came back with menus and then left to check on another table. Another ten minutes passed before she came back to take our order. We ask for waters, two of the same drink, and some chicken nachos. She returns a few minutes later to let us know the kitchen closed five minutes ago and that they can make our order, but we would have to order entrees right away. The menu and a google search both state that your kitchen closes at 11 on Sundays, but apparently this particular Sunday, closing time was 8. If we had received menus at a reasonable time after sitting down, we would have had ample time to make our decision. We should have been told upon sitting down that your kitchen was closing soon. We decided to go somewhere else and cancelled the nachos, which the waitress said was fine. At this point, we are still waiting on our drinks and haven't received our waters. We finally get our drinks and then out come the chicken nachos that we had asked to have removed from our bill. The waitress didn't tell the kitchen not to make them. We are awkwardly sitting at the table, drinks gone, no waters, with unwanted nachos sitting in front of us, just waiting for the bill or our waitress to remember we were there. Received our bill that said we owed $0, approached the waitress at the POS and were told it was an error. Watched her click around on the screen for a while, she still seemed frazzled and new, but overall friendly. Ended up spending 40 minutes there. Completely unacceptable service. We won't be returning soon."}
{"text":"Great place, good food. polenta fries are so good, informative servers, nice beer selection. Beer is brewed right across the street. This place is a hidden gem in a nice small town."}
{"text":"This restaurant is ok. It is one of the nicest restaurants in town, but the food is just so-so. I think they rely too heavily on prepacked ingredients. The hamburgers appear to be the pre-formed, frozen variety. You just can't make a good burger with those. Please change to fresh ground beef.  The black and blue salad is good, as is the grown  up Mac and cheese. Please bring back the grilled veggie sandwich. That was my favorite thing there.  I like the rooftop outdoor seating when the weather is nice. Great views of Mahomet.  This restaurant has the potential to be really good if they just make a few changes in the quality of ingredients.  I would eat here rather than driving to Champaign."}
