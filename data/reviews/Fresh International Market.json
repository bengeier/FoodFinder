{"text":"An extremely great number of Chinese food here! Vegetables, fruit, frozen food, snacks, anything you would think of. It even has Asian cosmetics. The owner is nice person. I wish it could have delivery service."}
{"text":"Best Asian Chinese supermarket in CU! They have everything that I need :) definitely was not expecting this caliber of supermarket in such a small place. They even have fresh live fish!"}
{"text":"Been there twice. First time I order sour pickle fish.. it was really bad. The fish was cold..? And some of the pickles were cold too? It wasn't that \"fresh\" I suppose. Maybe they just heated the leftovers.  Second time I was there I ordered Korean noodle, maybe it's the different name. Doesn't worth the price at all."}
{"text":"Has a wide selection of Asian food, especially Chinese food. Store is new and clean. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I can see it becoming the best Asian international grocery market in the area! They have a huge selection of foods predominantly from China, South Korea, and Japan. I have seen some Indian, Vietnamese, and Filipino stuff though including a generous section of spices and whatnot.  The prices are quite affordable and they have a great assortment of fresh produce, deli foods like ready to eat kimbap or squid salad, baked goods, pick your own hotpot items, and fresh bbq (put out at 11am). Their staff is super friendly and diverse (a sign at the entrance touts the multilingual abilities of the staff). They seem to have everything including more niche ingredients and even live seafood! I also appreciate that they freshly butcher meat to sell unlike other stores like Amko that freeze it all. There's also a home goods section with cute bowls, makeup, and other stuff. This is all relatively close to campus too and worth the trip. It's also right next to Golden Harbor, which is a plus.   I found out about their membership card. You get 1 point per dollar spent and it builds up - it seems handy especially if you shop here frequently.  They are still in the opening stage but hopefully the food court will open up soon!"}
{"text":"I feel a little bad for the other Asian food players in the area (AMKO, I still love you) but this place is about as close as CU will get to the bigger \"99 Ranch\" Asian grocery superstores you find in the bigger suburbs. So it might be a sign of Asian grocery gentrification but it's hard not to like this place. Although I'm not a big fan of the actual killing (I'm a guilt-ridden wannabee veggie), this place has actual LIVE fish in tanks. Big ones, too. I have never seen this in this town, let alone most parts of the Midwest--including Chicago. For a fresh fish fan, this is probably a godsend since any fresh seafood in the area is hard to come by. But don't stop there. If you want \"authentic,\" they even have Peking duck hanging in \"a window,\" something you don't see everyday in CU outside of Hong Kong. The place also is one of the biggest, cleanest, and fanciest Asian grocery stores in CU, so that's something. The staff is also surprisingly friendly and helpful. So clearly, the people behind this operation are running a tight ship. It has a decidedly Chinese (?) influence, so most items are from that general region, although you'll still find a lot of other staples for Korean, Japanese, and Indian cuisines. Prices are surprisingly cheap, which is a nice factor given its huge selection of fresh produce. So, again, as a supporter of more humble, less Hollywood groceries like AMKO, it pains me to say how great this place is. But, hopefully, the former will still stand strong and stick around. I'll try to shop at both from now on."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The milk bread is perfect for a grilled cheese sandwich. Grill in a little butter with a slice of havarti  cheese makes for an excellent lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great place, best Chinese grocery in town. I am so delighted that champaign has such a nice Asian supermarket"}
{"text":"It is a fantastic Chinese supermarket, nice and clean. The people there are so friendly and helpful. Shop there 3-4 times every week. It is one of my favorite market now!"}
{"text":"A new International Market in Champaign-Urbana!  We used to go to Green Onion or the Far East Grocery store to get our Asian groceries with roommates but we don't have to go so far to get our groceries anymore.  Also, Fresh International Market prices are fairly affordable and have varieties of options to select in term of fresh produce, fresh seafood, Asian sweets, bakeries, and a wide variety of beverages!  The place is extremely clean and well organized, though they're still putting inventories in place and preparing to open the food court.  We look forward to the food court and will visit again and again :)"}
{"text":"Amazing selection and prices!  Also it's very clean.  I can find all I need here in terms of produce and spices, and the staff is helpful."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the growing number of specialty grocery stores. This is now the largest and nicest collection of Asian fresh, frozen and packaged food.  They have a soft-opening on June 2, 2017 and I had a chance to walk through and take photos on June 1. My photos tell the story.  It appears there will not be too much duplication with the neighboring Annapoora Indian grocery, so with any luck they will compliment each other and have a synergistic effect. You will find Fresh International Market in the strip-mall old-timers call \"Royal Plaza\", just west of Golden Harbor restaurant, in the space formerly occupied by Piccadilly Liquors (and more); on Healey Street between Neil and Randolph. They have fresh live seafood in tanks, and they will prepare fish on request. Loads of unique fresh produce and even a separate section for preserved eggs and quail eggs..."}
{"text":"Great supermarket with that caters to Asian and Chinese appetite. It might be a little overwhelming if you come here for the first time. Even as someone who can read Chinese, I was overwhelmed by endless aisles of goodies and delicious food. My suggestion is to take your time, stroll around the market for 20 minutes, then grab a cart to get whatever you need! Caution: better have a pal who can control you so you don't go crazy stuffing the shopping cart!"}
{"text":"Visited the store yesterday and very surprised by the variety of Asian foods. FIM has just about everything that Chicago Chinatown grocer would have except it's closer to home. I have only one problem: price tags on the shelves need to be clear and precise. Too many price labels/tags are confusing-they tend to overlap and covered. Will visit the store again."}
{"text":"This place was great. It is very big on the inside. It use to be a small mom and pop type only 2 lanes now it has two whole sides with what seems to be everything. Service was good and friendly"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for these doors to open! I got to walk around with the store supervisor today, during their \"soft opening\" weekend. The store is bright and beautiful and is still gearing up for the grand opening this week. They will have a wide variety in the packaged goods, fresh produce and a wide variety of meats and seafoods. Can't wait to see the live seafood tanks full! I use a lot of spices in my cooking business, so I'm glad to see so many available in many different sections of the store.  The staff was friendly and helpful. Not everyone speaks enough English to help directly (check the name tags!), but I was quickly directed to someone who could answer my (many) question(s)."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I can get almost everything I want from a Asian market. All veggies, fruits and deli looked so fresh"}
{"text":"This market is awesome. Compared with other international grocery, here provides more choices especially their fresh veggies. There is sweet BBQ and special chinese appetizers. I'm really into their homemade sweet kimchi! !"}
{"text":"?? Think of this new market as an Asian Harvest Market. Yup, it was just that top notch. My family and I used to always voyage to the Chicago Asian market to buy food; simply because there weren't really any here that carried fresh and cheap food, so I thank the Champaign gods that this store went above and beyond the mediocre poorly stocked Asian markets. This store was huge, exceptionally clean, well stocked, and very friendly. There's a rolled ice cream station that will entice your kids, allowing you to shop their wide range of goods. Definitely a formidable competitor with other Asian markets in town and definitely my number one to go place for groceries now."}
{"text":"I read all the great reviews and decided to check out this store, but I wasn't too impressed. Maybe I have to go back because it was still in openings stages, but there wasn't too many things I wouldn't be able to find elsewhere in town."}
{"text":"This place is SOOO nice compared to a lot of the asian grocery stores in the area. It's very clean inside. They have a huge variety of products from many different asian countries.  They also serve fresh fish and other uncommon cuts of meat (like tripe and pigs' feet) here.  The prices are pretty comparable to other stores like Amko or Asian Supermarket on Prospect."}
{"text":"This is the best of the international Markets located in Champaign area. They offer a large assortment of China, Korean, Japanese, India and other unique Items. I found cantonese siu mei, like barbecued pork, roasted duck. Traditional Chinese style bread, teas, various types of drinks etc. There are very delicious With the reasonable prices. The staff are always very helpful and friendly, they gave me the free frozen bag when i bought the ice cream and frozen stuff ( super sweet in summer)  The store clean, well organized. 5 stars!!"}
