{"text":"Awesome food. Very nice people. Three salsa roja tamales with rice and beans made for a lot of tasty takeout. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Tamales and tacos are amazing! Very friendly staff. Had chicken, pork, and pineapple tamales. Chicken mole and Barbacoa tacos were on point as well!"}
{"text":"The pozole is awesome!!! The rest of the menu is pretty stellar too!! The staff is super friendly and the place has a nice family owned setting. Go try it out!!"}
{"text":"Nice authentic tacos at a reasonable price.  I had one barbacoa taco and one carnitas taco.  Both were good, but the carnitas was better."}
{"text":"Well, it's the holiday season so I was craving some tamales. Pass this place on my way home so I stopped in. So glad I did as I just finished my two tamales and they were damn good! Going back soon. What a gem."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good.  Have been three times now and it seems like it gets better every time.  Asada tacos are my favorite, and the tamales are unreal.  I've never had them like this place's before.    And the people that own it are super nice.  It's a neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Sooooooo GOOD!!! Everything was super flavorful, best place I have tried so far in Charlotte. The people that work there are super nice as well"}
{"text":"Great homemade authentic Mexican food.  Remember to push the door open. This was our only challenge. Service with a smile and a happy tummy."}
{"text":"Solid gold!  I had the pozole and a lengua and barbacoa taco. Everything was much, much better than Ezra."}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte! Very clean, super nice staff, and food is UNBELIEVABLE!!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best damn tacos in Charlotte. I am a lover of all tacos and have not found a better place with authentic tacos around."}
{"text":"As advertised, 5 star hole-in-the-wall authentic taco shop. To be fair, it's a very clean establishment and not so much of a hole in the wall. We had taco al pastor and barbacoa, both spot on and served with homemade verde and rojo spicy sauce as well as crema fresca (sour cream). Washed it down with some delicious fresh pineapple juice. We will be back very soon! FYI, it says cash only everywhere but it seems like the have ability to accept CC payments via the square on their iPad, but bring cash just in case. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in charlotte. I love the agua fresca can't get enough of it so fresh good drink for hot days. They also have the best tacos in charlotte because they are packed with meat and have great condiments with it."}
{"text":"Driving down the plaza when the sign popped out at me. I'm always up for a \"real\" tamale. Empty inside but the reviews had me motivated to try. I got a jalepeno cheese and chicken tamales. Good price and delicious."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat tamales (besides grandma's house) lol. Love the staff and love the food! The tamales are wonderful. And the tacos are huge and so delicious! I just tried the sopes today and those are also super delicious! I love this place and I would recommend it to anyone looking for traditional, home made Mexican food."}
{"text":"so glad we came here for lunch! they had tamale specials (3 tamales w rice and beans for $8) and my brother got Pollo asado. the tamales were so good and the Pollo asado was really tender and yummy. it's a hole in the wall, and I've found those to usually be the best :) wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"Please understand the gravity of this review, as what I am about to say bears much weight.  The 3 tacos that I had for lunch today (steak, barbacoa and al pastor) were THE best tacos I have ever eaten.  Tacos like this could bring about peace and understanding to feuding nations across the world.  I will most certainly be back, this time in sweatpants.  Well done, folks.  Well done indeed."}
{"text":"A real find. Cash only. The pastor tacos had amazing flavor. On my short list now of favorite nearby places."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place--first time was not good and sad to report that my second time was even worse. I'm a big tamale fan, but haven't found a great place for them since I moved from Chicago, so I was willing to give this place a second chance. And, for the record, I actually love the look and decor of Tamales La Pasadita.  My issue is with its food and service.   When I tried to place my takeout order today, the server spent most of his time watching a soap opera playing behind me and got testy when I modified my order.  When we got home to eat the food, the tamales were rubbery and not tasty at all.  Worst of all, in all of our meat orders, (carnitas and pollo), there was bone, which is always unpleasant to come upon.  Just generally terrible food. I loathe being the bearer of bad news, as there is nothing I would want more than to find a delicious hole in the wall spot.  But this place is not it."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents. I had tamales and got to try their tacos. The tacos were the best I've had in Charlotte -- fresh, flavorful and authentic. The tamales were good, but I was expecting them to be head and shoulders above every other tamale I've had, and they weren't.  Of the three kinds I tried, the best was the cheese with quesadillas. I was not able to try the sweet tamales."}
{"text":"If you like tamales, this is your stop. Green sauce with pork are my favorite Tamales . The vegetarian in a banana leave is great also but I wish the could make the same with chicken and red sauce...  recommended 100%"}
{"text":"Sí, sí, sí! Delicioso!  It's worth a stop at the ATM. Cash only.   This is a little hole-in-the-wall tamale and street taco restaurant. The seating is limited to a handful of booths and maybe a half dozen seating at the counter. How cozy!  Hubs & I packed up the newborn and were on a mission for authentic, fresh tamales. Score! When the plate arrived at our table, we instantly were pleased. The aroma took us back to some of our best vacations. The flavor was savory and the portions were generous.  We had a 3-tamale platter special and 2 street tacos for less than $15! And we were completely full and satisfied. What?!!  The food is made to order. Employees are very courteous.   Wish it were closer to me and I'd become a regular. Guess it's a good excuse to get out of my Charlotte bubble. Go, enjoy, take cash!"}
{"text":"Great tamales.  dont forget to get the side sauces.  i always want to branch out and try their other food, but i cant NOT order the tamales when i go.  they have corn, queso, pork, and chicken.  the other food looks good when other people eat it.  i usually get take out, the tamales are also good reheated at home.    dont expect much in the way of atmosphere, it actually does remind me of the small roadside restaurants ive visited while in central america, makes it feel more authentic to me i guess.  They are currently expanding into the next door space.  my one recommendation is that they switch to paper/plastic menus instead of the not-so-easily-updated marquee menu board they have, it just looks ugly with all the things marked out/taped over/written over.    if you like off the beaten path, small family run joints, this is the spot for you.  or if you just like good tamales, get it to go."}
{"text":"Had some really great tamales (the tamales made from fresh corn as opposed to pre-made masa). They were delicious. We also had a bunch of tacos. All were delicious. My favorite was the lengua! Mom and daughter duo run the place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome tamales and tacos! The restaurant has a good little selection of both plus some other menu items that I've yet to try. I've gone three times since they've opened me have not been disappointed! The staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is quite tidy. Definitely looking forward to going back many more times!"}
{"text":"Holy (insert all the cuss words here). This place is incredible.  Tiny little joint off Plaza, serving us amazing $8 specials of three tamales with rice and beans.  You can get a selection if you want. Also enjoyed two tacos $3 ea and two glass bottle cokes ($2.50), which were the best tacos - beating out my personal fav La Unica. And glass bottle coke is delish, so basically everything about this $20 meal for two is perfect. Try all the sauces and I promise you will roll out full and happy."}
{"text":"Super authentic Mexican food cooked. I think it's the best in Charlotte and I've tried it all on both sides of the border. Tamales made fresh daily, along with menudo, pazole, tacos, mole, etc. Don't the let the outside appearance discourage you, it's an oasis of deliciousness. I've gotten carry out and dined in and it's both been great.   They do take credit cards *most* of the time, but I've been a few times when their internet/square reader is down. Come with cash just in case!"}
{"text":"You know what they say. Tamale is another day.  One of the best places to eat in all of Charlotte with some of the most delicious Mole you can imagine.   I would know. I have a Mole on the inside.  Also, absolutely wonderful service and good prices and probably my favourite meal in the whole city that I've had so far - and I've had quite a few good ones. Like The Cure, I come to \"Charlotte Sometimes\", and when I do, I come here.  Really... One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in North Carolina. The prices aren't bad and the food is spectacular. The service is as good as the food. The mole is second-to-none and absolutely dreamy, perfect and delicious. The tamales are the excellent kind wrapped in banana leaves, and are amazing as well.  It's a very unheralded little place, so make sure you stop by when you're in North Carolina to try some of the best Mole I've had anywhere in the country.  Eat here quickly. Before the world ends as predicted by Dennis Quaid. Oh wait, that was that movie, The Day After Tamale.  Prices aren't dirt cheap, but then neither is your Dad. Oh wait, he is.  And don't try to kill your Tamale. Because Tamale Never Dies."}
{"text":"Great little tamale & taco joint. Definitely not fancy, and that's good, because it would detract from the character and the experience. Just a tiny shop with a few booths and a few counter stools, a tv showing Mexican programming, and a glass fridge with Mexican Coke and Pepsi in tall glass bottles. The service is super friendly and pretty quick. Prices are very reasonable. The pork tamales were the best I've had in Charlotte. Barbacoa tacos were also excellent. Can't wait to go back and try more kinds of tamales."}
{"text":"Delicious food, nice people, good prices, and fast service.  It doesn't get any better.  Do not let the outside appearance fool you, the inside is spotless.  Also, try the agua fresca. It's delicious."}
{"text":"As a recent Los Angeles ex-pat, I have a deep burning longing for really good authentic Mexican food. There have been some glimmers of hope and some bitter disappointments along the way (I'm talking to you! Cinco de Mayo! Really?! Liquid queso and bacon bits do not belong on good Mexican food!! SHAME!!)  Hermanos y hermanas, I am here to sing the praises of Tamales de Pasadita. Gone are the urges for an authentic barbacoa or al pastor street taco. No longer will you yearn for your Christmas tamale. Fear not the neighborhood or appearance of the rough this diamond is nestled in. A warm smile and a courteous hello await you just inside, as does the best food this reviewer has had in quite a while.  Much as gracias a mis amigos por la comida fantástica."}
{"text":"I truly support small family own business. My husband and I eat at a lot of \"hole one the wall\" establishments. I did not mind that the little boy working in the front was very inexperienced, or half of my orders, they did not have.  I gave it a three because the tacos were good but the salsas was just too salty. Salsa verde is the more spicy one.  The tamales had little fillings and the masa is too thick. This makes it \"dry\" to eat, but when dipped with the salsas, too salty.   Overall it was not worth $35.00.  I will try it one more time to make sure it was not a mistakes with the salty salsas. Plus I would like to try the three dishes they didn't have today."}
{"text":"Tamales La Pasadita is one of my favorite places to get food in Charlotte. It's on a strip of The Plaza with like 10 tire stores, a vape shop, hypnotist, etc., and the exterior couldn't be more modest.  The people who work there, from the lovely abuela to the adorable little girl, are super-nice.  The prices are crazy cheap. But of course, you're there for food, and we've never been disappointed.  The pork, chicken, barbacoa, cheese, and other tamales are all delicious and made to order. They also have tacos, mole, real fruit juices. I know the lines will grow once more people discover it -- at this point there's never a wait -- but I wish nothing but success to the fine people who run this place."}
{"text":"I've always wished I had a Mexican grandma. A little old lady who would speak to me in Spanish, make me tamales and pinch my cheeks. Tamales La Pasadita might just fill that void. When we arrived for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night, we were the only ones in the small restaurant. We sat at the counter and chatted with the friendly young man taking our order. He speaks beautiful English by the way, in case anyone was worried about a language barrier.   We ordered a little bit of everything... Tacos (even the lengua!), tamales, rice & beans, a tostada and aguas frescas. Everything was delicious, especially when we added the red hot sauce and sour cream from the squeeze bottles. The real stars were the tamales though! I tasted the chicken, queso & jalapeño (my favorite) and pineapple. The aguas frescas are the perfect way to cool off your mouth from too much hot sauce. I loved the watermelon, Ted enjoyed his pineapple. I swear, I think I could live on tamales and aguas frescas alone...  Happy to have discovered another authentic spot in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The chicken & steak tacos and tamales were seasoned well and really good paired with the 2 different salsas. I service was fast & the owner seemed nice. I took the food to go & enjoyed the meal at home. I would go back again for another order!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada and Barbacoa tacos were the best seasoned meat I've had in CLT.   Fresh made fruit juices, the watermelon water was so good.  And very nice family run business, with homemade food, very authentic at great prices.  $1.75 tamales and $2.75 tacos they will be taking credit cards by next week. Cash only at this time."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy spot. In fact, it's barely a spot at all. You really have to be looking or you might pass it, and even then there isn't much to see, so make sure you know where you are headed, then pull in carefully to the tiny parking lot.  Once inside, it's a nice scene, with an old-school counter feel, and a few booths, but it does not seem that they really get filled up that often. There is this window at the end of the booth where the tamales come out of. Not really sure what happens back there. It's like a magic tamale window. I need one of those at home.  The young boy working - and I do mean young, not to get him in trouble, but because he seemed to have no interest in working for his mother/aunt/whoever - was much more interested in the telenovela on the screen than taking orders. And he would forget what we ordered even before he was able to write it on the pad. And he forgot our drink orders. And silverware. And sauce. And he probably would not even have asked us to pay, for that matter. But he was friendly.  When it comes to food, it's tasty - some tamales can be dried out chunks of masa, but these are fresh and moist, though they can use a bit of that sauce (which we did get, telenovela and all), and that helped immensely."}
{"text":"Don't be intimidated by the outside appearance or all-Spanish menu -- this is the place you should go the next time you're looking for authentic Mexican food.  Everyone inside is super nice and the food comes out quick. And yes, they speak English which is great because tengo que practicar mi español.  The menu is the perfect size and everything is well-priced and well-portioned -- I got three tacos and two tamales (I'm a fat kid) for about $11. The food tasted amazing and I can't wait to try more!  Please go here so it can stay open and prosper!"}
{"text":"The owner Braulio is attentive and passionate about the restaurant. These tamales are definitely authentic and delicious. All three are different- left to right cheese with a slice of Chile, red sauce with shredded chicken (a little spicy), lastly green salsa with pulled pork. $2 per tamal. The carne asada taco is so fresh- add some of their homemade green salsa and sour cream. $2.75.  Their Aguas frescas (fresh juice) are made daily they are out of this world. $2.50 and you can get a refill.   This restaurant is a hidden gem with out a doubt. Stop by, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Superb and Fantastic Food.  Very Delicious and Tasty.  Definitely try the fruit juices - from the fruit not processed.  Reasonably Priced.  They accept the credit cards through Four Square.  Friendly Environment.  Fast and Efficient Service.  Family Owned and Operated.  We have short listed this restaurant on our Go To List.  Highly Recommend to All and don't let the outside fool you."}
{"text":"If you care more about good food than ambiance then you will love this place. No frills, just a small room with a counter and some booths. Perfect, I don't want to pay $10 to sit in a fancy room, I come for the food.   Ordered three tamales the pollo, puerco, and Coco.   All three of them were amazing! The coconut one would especially be good on nights when you're craving a little something sweet. They have a choice of salsa Verde and salsa roja with crema as well. At $2.00 a pop these are definitely worth the price and a great budget lunch."}
{"text":"This past Saturday I was out with some friends who wanted to check out Tamales La Pasadita. Having never heard of it, no problem. I love trying new places. It is a hidden gem on The Plaza. Although it appears very small from the outside it does goes further back with several booths and single seats down a countertop. Now, don't expect anything fancy, just a good old school restaurant.  The menu is on the wall above you and as I checked it out they offer an extensive list of items, Tacos, Tostados, Tamales (of course) and several more.  They also have aquas fresca in several different flavors. Having never been I decided to stick to some basics, just to get my bearings down. I ordered two chicken tacos, no cilantro, a carnitas tamale and rice and beans.  Everything is cooked to order and can be tailored as you wish, no cilantro, no problem.   The food arrived piping hot from the kitchen and was so fresh. The tortillas were heated/fried to perfection and the tacos had a great amount of chicken and onions. The tamale was amazing. And, the rice and beans..definitely order the rice. It was cooked perfect and just the right side to go with my meal.  It was hard to not finish them, but I was so full. Tamalas La Pasadita is a definite Taco Joint I will hit again.    A true family owned restaurant with great food and service..."}
{"text":"Was a very nice experience. Good food, nice people. Think Mexico street food, but CLEAN! They have a 93 health score.  If you like tamales you better get here fast."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. The people are incredibly nice. The food is delicious. As of yesterday, they now take cards/Apple Pay. We have been going for the pozole since they opened. We've also had tacos, tamales, the chicken mole, the quail, and the new tostadas that they just added to their menu. Everything is good! They always have aguas frescas to offer. We have had mango, watermelon, cantaloupe, and pineapple thus far. One time they had horchata to offer as well. If you haven't seen this place, it's across the street from the Food Lion on The Plaza. It's a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant that's well worth a visit. Be sure to ask for some hot sauce. Mmmmm!!"}
{"text":"You gotta love a great \"hole-in-wall\" style restaurant! When we were in the mood for some tacos after a day of drinking, we knew we had to try this place with so many Five-Star ratings! And boy did it ever live up to the other reviews! They offer the usual suspects from tamales, tostados to tacos and have a great fresh variety of types from barbacoa, chicken, tounge, and pork! Everything was incredibly fresh and tasted incredibly authentic! But beware their fruit flavored water is addictive and their jalapeño packs quite a punch  Definitely tons of flavor here and worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Great tamales, also love the chicken tacos. Service is awesome and the inside is clean and inviting. They also have delicious homemade salsas and the most delicious pineapple and mango juices."}
{"text":"This place looks suspect from the outside but the food inside is awesome!   Walked in and got greated with a smile and a loud \"Hola!\". I tried a pastor taco, a pork tamale, and a chicken quesadilla. All great!  I've never had a Mexican mother/grandmother...until now. She may not know it yet but it's happening. I felt like I was in her kitchen as I sat at the bar and she whipped up the food to order.  Thanks mamacita!"}
