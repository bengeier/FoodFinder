{"text":"Is really Club 5.  And holds this title because it has no competition.  Still, if you enjoy dancing and like Gay Men's Dance Music, this is the place to be on weekends...say \"hi\" to Craig, your most generous and helpful bartender!"}
{"text":"There was a time when Club 5 was trashy, ugly, and overrun with nasty people.  Then about five years ago, the owners finally started actually investing some money in the place.  Since then, most of the club has been entirely re-done (more than once, in some instances) and looks better than it ever has.  The most recent remodel in particular is surprisingly nice.  Club 5 is not without it's issues, though.  It will never be anything other than a small city \"club\" that verges on dive bar status.  It's just the nature of the space.  The music is spotty and generally doesn't depart from uninteresting mainstream pop-dance.  The crowd is more often a miss than a hit, and though I've only been once or twice in the past couple of years, I get the feeling it hasn't been \"busy\" quite some time.  It hasn't been the \"in\" place in years, and for the most part people have just stopped going.  You'll still find plenty of drag queens, creepy old men, and hopped up twinks, if that's your thing.  It's not mine.  That said, it's entirely possible my last visit was just an off night, and the place was unusually slow.  The space is surprisingly nice, bartenders are friendly, and drinks are quite reasonable.  Yeah, it could stand to be a bit classier, and the music needs some work, but if I was with a large group of friends, it could definitely be a good time.  And honestly, compared to the what the \"gay\" club in town has become, Club 5 is the pretty clear winner...with a little room for improvement."}
{"text":"Dear Club 5,  You make me sad. Most of the time. You are the only real dance club in Madison at most times. You're definitely the only gay dance club in Madison at any given time. And I love to dance. With the gays.   But you still make me sad. I feel like you are not living up to your potential. You're trying, I see. And maybe it's not all your fault. Maybe you've been given a crap shot at life since you're located in a former Bombay Bicycle Club building in a city with a really small gay scene. And, apparently, a really small dance scene.  You and I have spent many nights together over the years. Some were great, many were so disappointing. But you are what you are. And I've learned to accept you for who you are.  Therefore, whenever I'm in town, needing a place to simultaneously dance and hang with the gays, I will come see you. And you will be the same as you've always been.   Which, I guess, in some ways is comforting.  See you again, Club 5."}
{"text":"Mixed bag.  The music is alright, and the resident dancers are cute and fab and I want to pinch them. But I'm not sure about the unmotivated crowed just standing there at the edge of the floor and staring ....  not that hot.  I left there with this awful nagging feeling. Hmm, I wanted have fun, but maybe in another life, kinda thing."}
{"text":"I go to Club 5 once a week for Zumba and then a drink in the bar. It is usually clean although the bathrooms could use some work. I also have to comment on the bartenders. They always seem really put out to be waiting on me. Like they are doing me some kind of favor. Friendliness goes a long way and Club 5 needs to work on that. The sound system is great and the dance floor is nice,"}
{"text":"I've decided that Madison, Wisconsin is the Eugene, Oregon of the Midwest.  Or maybe Eugene, Oregon is the Madison, Wisconsin of the Pacific Northwest?  Anyhoo, it's uncanny how these two small college cities are so closely aligned and alike.  Just sayin'......  Now for the review:  This is a big bar, far from downtown Madison, right off the Beltline Highway.    I went on a Sunday evening, and only the main bar and the Barracks was open -- but not to worry, I was only there for the Barracks.  The Barracks is (mainly) \"men-only\", and the clientele is comprised of your mostly 30 and 40 something dudes, dripping in masculinity.    I loved it!  Drinks were strong (cocktails served in pint glasses, yo!) and several beers on tap.  On the night I went, the drink specials were Skyy Vodka for $4 bucks (served in PINT GLASSES, YO!) and $2 drafts.   Lots of flirty customers and the bartender, Terry, was pretty frackin' awesome!  Oh, also -- peanuts and popcorn for the bears!  Hard core porn on the TeeVees!"}
{"text":"There's something about going to a club that ALWAYS has people (both women and men) that find you hot.... hehehe.  So Club 5 gets TOP STARS in my vote.  The drinks are HELLA cheap, and LOADED (and not with gasoline quality vodka like everywhere in State Street).  There's PLENTY of dancing area, you dont' have to bump with the person next door.  And they play PLENTY of oldies like Madonna and Cher and Tina (isn't it sad that I'm calling Madonna old?  That means I'M old... Well.. Old School that is...  This is NOT for the prude and conservative (*cough*WIers*cough) as it's a gay club.  But if you want good drinks, good dance, and be able to hang out with MANY of your friends at the same time, this is the place..."}
