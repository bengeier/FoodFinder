{"text":"Our favorite place to order from. The service is great and super fast and the food is always good. And the delivery people are always so so nice."}
{"text":"I have always liked the food from Pizza Picasso and recently started getting delivery. Tonight  I placed an order and 2 hours later received it. The salad was all over the inside of the bag and the spinach manicotti was burnt. The \" garlic bread\"  was so hard it was impossible to take a bite. Nothing was hot or even warm. Very disappointing . Even more interesting was the lecture I received from the delivery woman. She said she couldn't t understand why people get so upset. We had a driver whose kid was sick and another driver whose car broke down and people should just get over it. 
If the owners and employees don' t care about us as customers maybe iit's time to stop trying to support a local small business. More than half of my order went down the garbage disposal- along with my $23!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pepperoni pizza with red pepper sauce!! The meatball calzone was pretty tasty! 

Wings are ok but have found the best item on the menu is the pizza."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and I have to say I am always very happy with my pizza. They have a lot of good deals including a great 7.99 lunch deal."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok not the best I ever had but it's pretty darn good... Don't have any complaints about the place, pizzas always hot when we pick it up... Wings are realy good and on the bigger side... Although hoagies are different.. not on a hoagie loaf.. more like a huge homemade flat bread bun... But the steak I had, had really really good taste to it..."}
{"text":"Never had anything bad from here. Bruschetta is stellar, pizza is always fresh and filled with toppings and cheese, and salads are crisp and flavorful.  Picked up an order once and I'm not sure if it was the owner or just a cook but the older woman working started a conversation out of nowhere while I waited for my order and she was very pleasant and warm. I always recommend this place"}
{"text":"Adding a little update here... Since 6 months ago when I had my horrible experience, I have ordered five or six times with NO issues what so ever. They even let me change my noodle shape the one time I ordered Alfredo. (I know it sounds dumb, but honestly it's such a small change I have no idea why they made such a big deal about it. I have been ordering the pesto turkey sandwich for almost 6 years and tonight I went out on a whim to try the portobello mushroom sandwich as a new experience. Let me just say, it is one of the best choices I ever made. The Rosemary bread they use on all the sandwiches is always fresh, soft, and delicious. You won be back Picasso."}
{"text":"I don't know who voted this place the best pizza in the burgh but it's not the best and it's not in the burgh."}
{"text":"First of all, Half the time I order food from this restaurant they do not include the ranch dressing. This particular time I ordered I asked for extra ranch and they wanted to charge $.75 extra per cup. The cups are not full most of the time. To make bad things worse I just got the pizza in the bottom of the box is soaked in Grease. I don't mean just a little grease it's the worst I've had anywhere. And zero sauce! Like they pretty much forgot or something. I'm going to see if I can include a picture to show you what I mean."}
{"text":"The best place to get pizza! My favorite is the Mediterranean chicken but they're all delicious. The crust is perfectly crispy and their homemade ranch is fabulous. The pasta is also great! Very fresh and clean. And super nice family run atmosphere. Love the BYOB as well!"}
{"text":"Ok let me start off with this...this pizza is pretty laughable but not the worst ive ever seen.

 My issue is with the service. Wow..ive never seen someone not care about there job in my life like this lol. The pizza took about 48 mins to get here. (Not bad). 

  Ok so the driver gets here and calls when shes outside as requested. I pick up the phone she hangs up. I go outside to meet her and shes standing outside of her car ( red corscica for future reference) complaining she was trying to call me and why i didnt pick up in a very snotty tone. OK..ill let that roll..shes upset. She continues to huff and puff while walking up the steps mumbling to herself rudely. Ok im starting to get annoyed. She finally makes it up yo my porch. Gives me the price and as she hand me the pizza says..\"you paid 16 dollars for a pizza..F*** that\" i was shocked...i told her no i paid 21 dollars for the pizza heres your tip thank you. And went inside because i was flat out hungry. 

As soon as i get inside the house i think to myself...wow. anyway....

   I opened the pizza box and i start to realize why she said that...this pizza is a joke! Very small, very slim on toppings. An all around dissapointment with the experience. 

  Note to picasso...dont p.o your drivers on there way to customers. Because your pizza does not make up for the rudeness. i will never order from here again and im a pizza junkie.."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for dinner with a dining companion.  We decided to come here because she had heard that they had the best pizza.  As you walk into the restaurant a banner proclaiming as much that was awarded from 100.7 is hung in plain sight near the counter.  Around the corner from the counter is a small dining room with a TV hung up on the wall.

For dinner we decided to order a XL plain cheese pizza to share and I ordered a water while my dining had some specialty lemonade which she enjoyed.  When the pizza came it was not as large as I had hoped but I still dove into it as I love pizza.  The cheese and sauce of the pizza were good but nothing extraordinary.  Where this pizza really shines is the crust of the pizza which I think is comparable to a french baguette.  Hard and crunchy on the outside while doughy and warm on the inside.  With that being said it may be the best crust that I have had in Pittsburgh.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future.  It wouldn't be my first choice in pizza places but the pizza was decent enough and I loved the crust."}
{"text":"The best authentic Italian restaurant in the area. I work in the area and always make a point to visit, sometime for business meetings. Big big menu, love it!"}
{"text":"AWFUL DELIVERY EXPERIENCE

My experience with Picasso Pizza & Pasta was the absolute worst ordering experience I've ever had. I ordered a Colossal Cheese Fries, and Spinach and Artichoke Calzone at 11:12pm on 4/19 for my boyfriend and me. The order still hadn't arrived after about an hour, and the restaurant is about 9 minutes from our home, so we were getting a bit frustrated. Finally, around 12:30 the delivery driver called and said that she couldn't find our address in her GPS and that the restaurant had given her the wrong zip code. I confirmed my zip code, and she asked what court I lived in, which indicated to me that she knew about the gated community where I live. We waited for another 40 minutes for her to arrive. The driver (Cheryl, as the receipt indicates) didn't even get out of her car to give us our order. My boyfriend and I walked to her vehicle and she handed us a medium sized pizza box with a smushed up pepperoni pizza inside (NOT OUR ORDER AT ALL) and repeated her story about having been given the wrong zip code. She showed me on the receipt, but the zip code was correctly printed on it. Her car was dirty and smelled heavily of smoke. When we asked why our order was incorrect, she replied (in a very rude tone) that \"this is what they gave me. I'm just the driver.\" This is absolutely unacceptable. We had paid almost $30 (and the driver got a prepaid 20% tip) for a cold smushed up medium pizza that took 2 hours to get to us, when we ordered something completely different. I am especially irritated by this, as I am a vegetarian, and can't even eat pepperoni."}
{"text":"Tried them tonight via Grubhub. Food was great, I ordered the steak sandwich and it was prepare to my liking. Those rolls are awesome, the steak was hot and veggies were fresh and dressing was very tasty. The quoted delivery time was on the button. Driver polite. Order with confidence says I."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Pittsburgh. They have great dining. Nice atmosphere, servers are kind. Too many options on the menu, everything is home made, special in the house, burger is just mouthwatering. Def will return"}
{"text":"Despite all the other experiences I was vey pleasantly surprised by Picasso.

It was one of two restaurants that delivered on GrubHub at 10pm on a Monday night when I wanted to order. I placed an order for wedding soup and pepperoni rolls.

The weddings soup was a little different than I am accustomed to but it was still very good and hot. The pepperoni rolls were simply amazing. I wish I took a photo because they tasted even better than they looked. They were a twist roll which was different but great for eating.

The delivery driver was very kind and quick. My address was certainly on the edge of their delivery zone but it received in 45 minutes with GrubHub estimating 1 hour. He called a little before he got to me to confirm the address and was there only about a minute later.

A great experience all in all!"}
{"text":"I love everything I've tried. You really get awesome food for the price. I've never had any issues with delivery, flavor, order accuracy, or customer interaction with this restaurant and I'll def keep grub hubbing and gaining weight from them. The pizza, sandwiches, Stromboli, gyros, etc.. All awesome!"}
