{"text":"Finally tried this place out after walking past so many times.  We had the Porky Pig and the Cabbage Patch Kid.  Favourite was the Cabbage Patch Kid (love me some fried brussel sprouts).   Only complaint, that kept me from giving this 4 stars is that the fried pierogis aren't actually fried, but baked, which was really disappointing."}
{"text":"I got take out from there the other day and I gotta say, it was amazing. If you like perogies, you'll love this place. If you like food, you'll love this place. If you breathe air, you'll love this place. I've only been there once and I've had the smokey pig, but I would recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out for lunch today and were really impressed. They have dine-in available too and have a nice space. They offer a wide selection of toppings on the perogies - and it was really hard to pick which ones to try first. We went with Baba's Classic - which have caramelized onions and cheddar cheese on them, and Ms. Piggy - which have pulled pork and goat cheese on them. We got half of them deep fried and half boiled and both were excellent. The pulled pork had a solid bbq flavour.  You get 8 perogies with each order and the topping portions were generous. It's great that we have a pierogi place in Leslieville now. We can't wait to go back to try the Donald Duck perogies (confit duck leg, caramelized onions, swiss cheese) and the Kicking Kimchi perogies (kimchi, habanero cheddar, wasabi sauce)."}
{"text":"I should have taken my $24 and set it on fire  -  ordered the surf and turf  -  i had one tiny bite of what I assume was crab  - there was supposed to be lobster and crab plus beef  -  the beef was so tough that I had to spit it out or choke on it.   There was not a trace of lobster.  There was no wasabi as stated and although I had asked for no cherry tomatoes they decided to throw 3 in there!!!!   The perogi themselves were okay as were the onions  -  otherwise this was the most tasteless dish I have ever had in restaurant.  Will never be ordering from this establishment again."}
{"text":"Place to be if you love pierogis! So many to choose from! Very trendy and stylish d√©cor and has great atmosphere and great food. Cant wait to come back when I am in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"yes yes yes! The only thing is that its a bit pricey for the portion. But I ordered two different kinds and they were both delicious!"}
{"text":"Small pierogi place with a diverse menu. The food, however, is just too heavy. Maybe it's just not for me but there wasn't much on the menu that i liked. Can someone really sit down and eat a meal exclusively of pierogi's? I feel like they should expand their menu slightly to offer a wider array of sides.  I also might be a little biased because at the time we went the business next door was painting so the entire restaurant stunk of paint.  Good luck to the owners but I don't think I'll be repeating."}
{"text":"Pierogi were new to me, but I will keep them in good memory. Even the dessert-ones are more than worth a try!"}
{"text":"I was there in early March, weather was cold outside but once through the doors I knew I had found the right place for dinner. I was travelling on business and alone, the waitress/bartender treated me like family and explained all of the fabulous choices. Cn't wait for next trip to Toronto so I can return."}
{"text":"Wait staff is always smoking outside, and very overpriced for the limited ingredients they use. Faux-Foodies and wanna-be food critic type of spot, and this place is owned by the same hospitality baron who has gbk and the Italian place no one cares about. For some reason they also installed a ratty looking patio with a useless section on the Gerrard Sidewalk...they must have bribed Paula Fletcher or something because originally the plan was voted down by locals.  Democracy can't stand in the way of crappy perogies, I guess. If you want good food in the area just take the short trip to the danforth or queen street. Really this place is just useless and tacky (GET LOADED sign across the street from a daycare, ugh!)."}
{"text":"Near the St Lawrence market it's nicely tucked away from traffic and creates a nice atmosphere with appropriate music for a Friday night.. Oh and the foods not bad either with a creative array of pierogi options it's a true win for any pierogi fan"}
{"text":"The food was great! The service...not so much. Our waitress appeared to be half asleep, did not offer to take a drink order, did not check in with us after we got our food, then proceeded to ignore us when a bunch of her friends came in to eat. She took our plates away but didn't offer to bring the bill. She leaned on the table beside us and spoke to her friends until we motioned for the bill. Needless to say, she didn't get a tip.   The buffalo chicken perogies were very yummy and I would return to try something different as a lot of the options sounded great. Hopefully there is more attentive wait staff on the next time."}
{"text":"Casual, a little hip but not uncomfortably so. It's a small place. Never had loaded pierogies before, but it seemed like too interesting of a concept to pass up.  I ordered the Smoking Pig Roast, crispy, and it was awesome. Hot, a touch spicy, very flavorful bowl of pierogi goodness.  There's a small bar here, just enough to serve mainly vodka-based drinks. Never had a Moscow Mule in anything other than a copper mug, but I didn't here, and I'm not complaining.  It's a little off the beaten path, but for me the trip was worth it. Recommended."}
{"text":"Wow! Best lunch my group of friends had in Toronto for the price. Great vibe and server was very friendly. Ordered the buffalo chicken and it was really good, got a to-go box and my friend ate it all without my permission so I'd say she liked it too"}
{"text":"I ordered from Loaded Pierogi off Uber Eats, a $13 dish and it came with 4 un-cooked pierogies. Raw dough. DISGUSTING! What kind of service is this? There are 8 maybe 9 pierogis and half are uncooked? How do you even do that?  Very disappointing, will not be recommending this to anyone."}
{"text":"Loved it! The place is very small but cozy. Baba's classic perogies are the best! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super good pierogi!  I make my own so I like to make comparisons.  Not sure of they make in house or purchase from a supplier, but they are good and consistent: dough is light but not thin or brittle.  Possibly a sour cream and butter based dough.  Potato filling is fluffy, not heavy, guessing they are a Yukon, red potato blend.  The plating with toppings are fantastically paired well.  I do not have a stomach to get down 3 plates but the Breakfast and Cabbage patch were really good!  Most popular I was told was the buffalo chicken.  Maybe I missed out, but overall liked my selections!  Will visit again and would recommend to anyone looking for a fill-your-tummy meal."}
{"text":"Love this place. Was recently back in gold old Canada for home leave and tried out this new polish place. Delicious food and at a great price point."}
{"text":"Great food and music complete the dining process. The perogies were served with the option of deep fried or boiled or half and half. They were so hot and flavorful,  hard to believe I ate all 8 of them. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"These pierogi's are delicious! I tried it once and it was one of the best pierogi's I have eaten. I feel like the toppings are the cherry on top! Could have used a little more sour cream, but overall I rate Loaded Pierogi a 4 star. Good customer service too."}
{"text":"Loaded is weird. Do you have the nicest business cards and menus that I've seen. super Swink. They also have a dusty old bar and Old ass tables. But whatever man it's all about the food right? They deafly got some really interesting combinations for pierogies the dock is pretty awesome they call it the Donald Duck. That's the big winner at this place the pierogies underneath are just okay.  I have to be on some nerve any huge fan of Boyle pro geese they need to be panfried but I got the boiled cause I'm trying not to get fat. Next time I'll get them fried because they probably tasted way better."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time, having never been to the other locations.    The Good: -The pierogis are offered boiled, deep fried, or half-half. -The deep fried have a great texture, they're not grossly deep fried. -The pierogis are legitimately tasty, both boiled and fried. -Portions are decent (8 pierogis + the toppings) for the price ($8-$16).  The Annoying: -We were given the impression that each type was stuffed with something different, so we ordered more than we usually would have. That's not the case though.  Every order has the exact same \"original\" style pierogi with various toppings thrown on top.  Much less adventurous than different stuffings.  The Bad: -Service was terrible.  Waitresses also work the bar, so they disappear for long periods of time.  They're nice, but they need a new system."}
{"text":"I went with a Groupon and so it is a good experience to try out the Pierogi.   The Groupon includes 2 drinks of $10 each.   If you don't drink it makes not much difference to use Groupon or not.   Food is quite affordable at around $15.   Cocktail is expensive at around $10 each.   And they charge tax on how much you eat and so I have to pay more tax.   Many restaurants only charge tax on how much you paid for the Groupon.   Another thing I don't like is that they don't take reservation.   I was worrying that I may not be able to get a seat at Sunday dinner time.   But when I stepped in the restaurant is almost empty.   There are a few people ordering take out though.   Another thing I don't like is that the meat portion is too small although it is tasteful.   I order the lobster Pierogi and I can hardly find any lobster in it.   In other words the entree are really only worth $15 but no more than that."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but extremely decadent food. I love richness, but this was too much even for me. Also seems rather overpriced for the amount of perogies they give you- you can get twelve handmade down the street for 5.50$ at the St. Lawrence. \"Pretty yummy hipster food- but not particularly skillful\" is my verdict!"}
{"text":"Awsome experience.  Excellent food.  Great atmosphere.  I really can't say I've ever had a craving for pierogies. After dining here twice,  I'm hooked.  The great people and unique flavours make this place worth visiting.  It's good value for money and you'll leave stuffed.  The flavour combination are really unique and tasty.   The place is very comfortable and service is friendly.  What's holding you back?"}
{"text":"We wandered in on a rainy Wednesday at 5pm in the afternoon. The place smelled of freshly varnished wood when you walk in but has a warm cozy glow.  We were seated quickly and they brought us a high chair for our toddler.  We ordered the Classic perogies and the Pig Out perogies. The classic were basic potato perogies with sour cream, grated cheddar for cheese, caramelized onions on top. The Pig Out were the same as the classic with bacon on top. We were brought a carafe of water and even a plastic cup for our toddler.  We ordered half deep fried and half boiled but the boiled ones were better, much more traditional.   The perogies tasted very fresh as well as the toppings. The mixture of bacon, fresh sour cream, caramelized onions, and melted cheddar cheese tasted heavenly, melts in your mouth.  They did have other more exotic options on the menu...notably mushroom and truffles, kimchi, philly cheese steak, pulled pork, two types of bacon, lobster, surf and turf (lobster and steak), avocado and chicken, and many others. But I'm just a classic with bacon kind of girl.  Our bill was $17 plus tax and tip for two. They had daily specials where you could get a beer for an extra $2 or tall can for $3.50 or wine for $4.  As we ate our meal, two other families walked in with kids. This is definitely a kid friendly place.   I definitely recommend this place for their classic with bacon, boiled not fried."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time recently: half-and-half (half fried, half steamed) chicken & avocado dish. TOTALLY scrumptious. I'm a fairly picky eater, and there was *nothing* I'd have changed about this dish (well, okay, crispy bacon crumbled over it would have been killer!). Definitely going to go back ... and the cocktail I tried (whose name I can't remember, but it had vodka and ginger beer) made the rest of my day go down really well, too. ;)  It's a smallish place, and was empty when my friend and I went in, but I don't expect that to last for long. The food, the drinks, the service: all were very, very, good. The only reason I'm holding off on that last star? I wanna go back and tell you all how delicious and *consistent* the quality is. :) That, and I really, reeeeeally want to try the dessert pierogies."}
{"text":"Heard about the restaurant and thought I would give it a try. I ordered the Buffalo chicken and I must say it did not disappoint. I am definitely coming back and I recommend it to anyone who loves pierogies!"}
{"text":"We ordered a mix of fried and boiled pierogies based on our server's recommendation.  Our favorites were the cabbage patch kid and the Ms Piggy, we also had the porky pig and the Donald Duck.  It was Saturday night so it included a beer!  We had dinner here before walking over to the Air Canada Center for a hockey game."}
{"text":"This place is really not bad. I went in for lunch today and got the Porky Pig pierogies with bacon. The portion was a good size everything tasted good and fresh, and I certainly didn't feel as if I paid too much. The 4 stars is for managing expectations. Like I said its not bad but don't come in here expecting the best pierogies of your life. Especially if you are accustomed to Ukranian church pierogies. These ones are smaller and don't have any cheese in the filling, just potato. Worth checking out for sure and I will be back cause it was a pretty decent lunch for the price."}
{"text":"The pierogi tasted like the frozen ones you can get in a bag for $2. Toppings were pretty good, but definitely not worth the money."}
{"text":"We came here from Buffalo (a big Polish city with lots of pierogi restaurants) looking to try out this new concept. It's next to a restaurant called Hank's- make sure you take the door to the left, as Hank's signage is more prominent. My grandma ordered the thai ginger steak pierogi and I got the kickin' kimchi pierogi. The classic boiled pierogi, as the waitress recommended, were the best- absolutely fantastic texture, better than anything in Buffalo. The toppings went really well with the pierogi, somewhat more than you'd expect. The steak was sort of hard to eat in a compact bite but was tasty, while the kimchi was mild and incredible. The pierogis served to add a really nice texture and a platform for the other flavors. This is a really cool restaurant concept and I'm excited to have been able to try it- hope it succeeds."}
{"text":"Had the wild mushroom and goat cheese pierogi, they were ridiculously delicious. As a polish ukrainian I can testify that the pierogi are legit,  was told they're made by a polish family in mississauga (obviously!) ...all the dishes come with piled on toppings (think poutine-style), atop 6/7 pierogi, and cost between $6.50-15 (the $15 dish comes with a confit duck leg).   They also have a couple of draught beers (I had the house lager for $5, it was good) Most importantly though, they also serve 15ish different vodkas, also sold in flights.   It was their first day open and things were already running smoothly, servers were super friendly and knowledgeable, ready with suggestions.   I work 2 doors down and will definitely be back...Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"OMG this is one of my favourite places to go, I mean who doesn't like pierogi's piled sky high with amazing toppings! Not to mention the yummy dessert ones! I have had the Pig Roast twice and it never disappoints. Service is fast and very friendly. Very reasonably priced as well. I would recommend this place to anyone in the financial district for lunch, or for anyone looking for dinner to cushion the blow after happy hour drinks. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. The owners have hit on an idea that's at once novel, delicious, and efficient. Perogies, that staple of eastern European comfort food, provide the foundation for a variety of toppings from fancy to familiar. On top goes a generous slathering of pulled pork, or a confit duck leg, or roasted vegetables. Except for two flavours of dessert perogie, that's it. As a result, you're not through your glass of Sweetgrass ale before your meal is in front of you. The portions are just right for most people, especially when you consider the fat content of the toppings--sour cream is omnipresent. If the menu choices don't seem lavish enough, you can add any toppings you want at a small incremental cost. The result is very good value, especially if you take advantage of the daily special which basically gets you a free beer. I did think the music was a bit too loud, but clearly it wasn't bothering the other patrons."}
{"text":"I ordered the kimchi entree and thought it was delicious. The portions were quite filling as I could barely finish and the choices were amazing. The service was excellent and the food came promptly. I would come back to try the other dishes and the dessert pierogis. Definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night.  Place has a really nice environment.  We had Donald duck and The catch.  Very satisfied with the service and food! Would recommend to anyone to check it out"}
{"text":"Cozy spot, friendly service, great pierogies & good value. Tried a few different kinds (all good), but my favourite were the Wild Mushroom & Truffle. You get 8 pierogies in an order.  Now we know where to go when in the mood for pierogies!"}
{"text":"This place was an accidental great find! We weren't sure what we wanted to eat, came across this place and it ended up being a hit. We ordered the mushroom (added bacon) and the kimchi (added chorizo) and they were delicious. We even recommended friends to try this place as well. Definitely returning when we are in Toronto again!"}
{"text":"Interesting options and good, but limited, beer options. The perogies are available seep fried or boiled. All topics are placed on top of the perogies, so every order starts with the same basic potato and cheese perogies. Our waiter told us that Loaded perogies actually buys these from some family in Mississauga that hand makes them although I'm not sure how that would be possible based on the popularity of this place.  They offer dessert verified which are filled with a light sweetened cheese, but I haven't tried these. Overall a good place to eat when the nearby pub grub won't cut it."}
{"text":"Three of us really liked the sweet cinnamon apple dessert, with crispy pierogis. The mushroom and onion pierogis also good. Portion sizes are about 7 pierogis in an order, plus toppings. Beer selection limited with about 4 on tap and 5 in cans."}
{"text":"I came here with my colleagues for a group lunch today.  We love perogies, so this restaurant sounded fantastic.  The menu sounded great.  However when the food came, we were not too impressed.  When reading the menu, we thought the different menu offerings were different stuffings to be found inside the perogies.  That was not the case.  Every dish consisted of the same potato filling with the different fillings on top of the perogies.  After about the 3rd perogy, we were all pretty perogied out.  Like another reviewer mentioned, you really can just go to the supermarket to pick up a pack of frozen perogies, then throw whatever topping you like on top....same thing.  Oh and don't get the dessert perogies.  I thought the sweet cheese filling might have a cream cheese filling.  It was not.  The dessert perogies were filled with a strange chunky cheese none of us enjoyed."}
{"text":"Excellent service, the young man had a smile on his face always and was very pleasant. The food wad great, it was unique and I highly recommend it to everyone. Thank you Loaded pierogi for the great meal and service!"}
{"text":"Had take-out on a Saturday evening which was delivered fairly quickly. We ordered the fried Wild Mushroom & Truffle pierogis, Bacon, Sauerkraut & \"Oh Yeah\" Bacon and the Cabbage Patch Kid. The portion sizes are good. 8 pierogis per serving. We just found that the food was very bland and the pricing was slightly too high for the value."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken pierogi dish and friend had the wild mushroom & truffle pierogi dish. Buffalo chicken was okay, the chicken was \"freezer chicken\" as I like to call it (pre made and dumped in a fryer) and had been overlooked in this instance so it was just dry and chewy. Friend says hers was good but nothing extraordinary. Pierogies themselves were good."}
{"text":"Delicious and fluffy perogies topped with tons of different meaty options! Where have you been all my life? I have never visited the location, only ordered delivery. They travel well and are now part of my usual ordering spots. Loses 1 star due to slightly small serving size."}
{"text":"The restaurant's food is exquisite. Comfort food indeed.   I love the buffalo chicken!  You should try their freshly made Pierogis as well.  I come here with my family frequently, and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely obsessed with pierogis so when I heard about this place I was excited to go! I ordered the buffalo chicken with extra bacon fried. It took quite a while for the food to come as making pierogis is fairly simple but when it did come it reminded me of smokes poutine as you get the basic potato pierogi covered in toppings. Although I prefer my bacon inside the pierogi, I still enjoyed the meal and even got the pierogi dessert which was a light cheese filling instead of potato. In all it was a good experience and I might visit again but I'll probably be more likely to enjoy some out of the freezer make at home pierogies before that."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening after work. There are 3 or 4 big booths and then some smaller tables. The service was good and the pierogis were really good! I tried the mushroom and truffle oil ones and I would definitely have them again. Also had 2 pints of their beer on tap. Everything tasted good and was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great little out-of-the-way place with a young vibe and novel food. 6-8 Pierogi (your choice, boiled or fried) form the base of each of their menu items and then they pile on the toppings. I had the Bacon, Sauerkraut, and Bacon! (Yum!) and some apple dessert pierogi as a follow-up. Way too much food for one person, with a soda, $US22."}
{"text":"We arrived on a groupon to try out this restaurant.   We were very pleased with our service, our fantastic meals, the decor and leave room for strawberry chocolate dessert.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES. This place is comfort food at its best. There are a ton of options for creative pierogi combinations but pierogies themselves are standard potato ones. I had the Baba's classic with sweet caramelized onions and cheese. It was heavenly. Will definitely try one of the more adventurous creations next time.   The interior is neat and well spaced out. I love that there is a lot of natural light. We went on a Saturday night and it wasn't particularly busy. The server was nice and refilled our water frequently and made sure to check in a few times. The restaurant was pretty quiet so sometimes we were the only ones talking in the whole joint but that's okay! I'm not as self conscious as a should be sometimes XD."}
{"text":"Got take out from here, had the mushroom and truffle pierogis.  Service was quick and friendly, didn't have to wait too long for the food at all.  Pierogis were ok, I found the skin to either be over cooked or under cooked. You have the option of regular or fried. I would probably try the fried next time. Filling wasn't too dry. Mushrooms that topped it were super delicious though!   Overall I would say while the pierogis were decent, it does not offer value for your money.  Very interesting concept though!"}
{"text":"We ordered to have this place delivered and I must say, the flavours are fantastic.   I did find it a bit odd that they are all potato filled and then 'loaded' with your flavour choices on top. Thats weird but it kind of works...I mean I like the idea of my chicken and avocado inside and cooked like a dumpling but I think how they do it actually makes the flavours pop more.  You've undone all that I know of pierogi and Im still deciding how I feel about it..."}
{"text":"Walked into this place today as part of our foodie adventures, but since we just had a pretty big brunch, we ordered their dessert pierogis.  I also kept seeing \"vodka\" everywhere so I guess they have an extensive vodka menu.    Sweet Apple and Caramel Pierogi - Stuffed sweet cheese pierogi, cinnamon spiced apples and caramel sauce.  This tasted amazing especially when it's still warm. This would be great with a scoop of ice cream.  4.5/5.    Strawberry and Chocolate - Stuffed sweet cheese pierogi, strawberry compote, chocolate sauce & chocolate crumble. 4.5/5  Let me explain the ratings.  The sweet cheese wasn't exactly \"sweet\".  I also found it quite dry and quite bland in flavour.  Was still quite enjoyable though and I would definitely go back to try their savoury pierogis."}
{"text":"So good. The menu said \"authentic butter chicken\". I didn't believe the menu. I thought the menu was a liar. The first few bites were confusing and regretted not going with the pulled pork or bacon or chorizo or pig meat. A few bites later, I got used to the melding of Polish and Indian. It became something beautiful... Like an edible Lisa Ray. Other good things included the decor, the music, and perfect portion sizes."}
{"text":"Pierogies are ok. The toppings are extremely flavourful. Fast food style. You order at the counter, they deliver to the table. Still wondering how a chain of pierogie restaurants is going to survive"}
{"text":"Do you love pierogi? Do you love poutine?   If you said yes to either of those, you're going to love this -- especially because these guys combine those two ideas together to create just pure taste bud exciting  dishes.   My recommendation is to get the pierogi half and half (half boiled, half fried).  I had the buffalo chicken, which was phenomenal, but I would recommend getting something else as the buffalo chicken sauce does become a little too much towards the end. If you are going with a partner or some friends, it may be best to share a few different dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great prices, location is super nice. You can eat a reasonable meal here for 10 dollars and feel pretty full walking out.  Service was walking the line with being overly friendly, but it worked out really well. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a great place and the food is tasty. I got a half-half, which is half traditional(boiled) and half crispy(fried). Got a groupon so it was a really good deal, but even without the price is not expensive at all."}
{"text":"Crispy perogies with interesting sides on top, like butter chicken and mushroom/truffle. The food selection is limited though and in my opinion don't go that well with perogies. On the plus side, the restaurant has a cool feel and service was fairly quick."}
{"text":"Food was great but deceiving name, the pirogies aren't filled.. I got the buffalo chicken, it was amazing. I will definitely be going back to try other kinds of pirogies!"}
{"text":"In a search for some not-too-pricey dinner that we could grab relatively quickly before heading to an event at The Sony Centre, my friends and I considered a couple of joints directly across the street before settling on Loaded Pierogi a short walk away.  I'm glad we went, because the $12 average per plate was reasonable, and we were able to order a few types to share.  I chose The Cabbage Patch Kid and Wild Mushroom & Truffle, and my friends chose the Bacon, Sauerkraut, and \"Oh Yeah\" Bacon plus the Donald Duck.  My favourite was the Wild Mushroom & Truffle.   Although there isn't much actual truffle in the dish, I enjoyed the mix of sauteed fresh mushrooms together with the creamy goat cheese.  A lovely mix.    One of my life fantasies is that I will someday become a rich old lady, wearing overwhelmingly odorous perfume, wrapped in Macklemore's thrift shop-style coat, hurling cats at people while screaming \"What the hell is this crap? BLACK truffle? I only eat WHITE TRUFFLES!\"  Heh heh heh.  This will mess up the horrendously applied red lipstick as I throw a major fit, but it will be worth it.  But, I digress...  The confit duck leg on the Donald Duck was a bit salty for me, but everything else was pretty good.    This place kind of reminds me of poutine or fries places, where you can load it up with whatever toppings you want on a relatively bland medium (the potato, or in this case, the pierogi).  You'll be asked whether you'd like your pierogies regular or crispy, where regular is boiled and crispy means fried.  Service was very friendly and would check in on us from time to time, asking us whether we were enjoying our meal and to refill drinks or water.  I asked for two cups of ice for my menopausal, hot-flashing self (y'know, cause I was channeling my inner, crotchety old lady persona) and she happily obliged.    Each dish comes with 8 pierogies, and each sweet/dessert dish comes with 4 pierogies.  My friend M lamented that the strawberry & chocolate pierogies, served fried, contained only a drizzle of chocolate rather than large pieces of it, but I think she's still glad she got this item (it wasn't listed on the menu).  I'd come back and try the sweet apple & caramel mix one next time."}
{"text":"If you love pierogi, you have to go. This is a small place, with about a half-dozen booths against the wall, one table for large groups and some seats at smaller high tables and at the bar. I wandered in at about 7:30 on. Tuesday night, and it wasn't full, but all the booths were taken, so I sat at the bar. They have a cocktail list, and a very limited wine list (I.e. one red, one white) but beer makes more sense to me with pierogi, and they have a selection on tap and in bottles.  The service was decent. I had the \"Cabbage Patch Kid\" - and opted for half-and-half deep-fried/ boiled pierogi. It was not a huge serving, but substantial and delicious. The toppings were fried brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, green onions and sour cream. Not your traditional pierogi - but I'll have that the next time. And there will be a next time."}
{"text":"I personally was disappointed with my experience. Service was slow on a Sunday night. I got the perogies with bacon and sauerkraut, half boiled half fried. Nothing special and the boiled ones didn't seem fully cooked. Not sure I'll return."}
{"text":"Ordered the Truffle Mushroom and Butter Chicken.  Both were tasty and got the half boiled half fried.  Preferred the chewiness of the boiled but definitely order fried if you order a dessert dish.  Can't wait to try others."}
{"text":"Fun paint night with my girl friend than we meet up a with our boyfriends for dinner.   1) There is no good parking. So parked a block away and walked here. 2) kinda small it maybe sits 30 people.  We picked this place because we found a Groupon and wanted to try it out.   My first impression is that the seats are really small. The booths are tight so it's not very comfy to sit four to a table. Warning for plus size people this will not be fun (I'm in this category). There are stools so you have options. I'm curvy so I did find the booth space tight.  I ordered the THE CATCH (14): Atlantic lobster & crab with julienne sweet peppers, caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce, sour cream & green onions  My fiancee got the BACON, SAUERKRAUT & \"OH YEAH\" BACON(13.50): Two types of crispy bacon, center cut & double smoked lardons with house made sauerkraut, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sour cream & green onions  My girlfriend got SMOKING PIG ROAST (14): Smokey BBQ pulled pork, center cut bacon, chorizo sausage, cheddar cheese, sour cream & green onions.  Her boyfriend got the BUFFALO CHICKEN (12.50): Crispy breaded chicken breast, tossed in our medium spiced BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, buttermilk ranch dressing, sour cream & green onions"}
{"text":"I'm totally puzzled by the reviews.  First, the bathroom has no toilet paper or paper to wash your hands.  Bad sign.  Second the waiter was not experienced.  Hard to recommend 1/3 of the menu when you don't eat pork.  Third, we ordered a bottle of red wine.  They couldn't find any bottles of red.  They asked the manager who couldn't find any wine.  They have a full wine menu! Fourth, they didn't have vodka and went to the restaurant beside to get one.  I had to pay 2 bills!  Finally, the perogi's were not tasty.  Not good.   Puzzled how this place stays in business"}
{"text":"Delightful find in downtown TO for a quick meal to-go. I arrived late and was starving in my hotel, and Loaded Pierogi was exactly what I was looking for. It's probably not healthier than fast food, but it feels more wholesome and homey! Loaded Pierogi is a little hard to find -- Google maps will actually direct you the wrong way down the street -- but once there you'll be happy you took an extra moment to look. Staff was awesome, meal was delish, I only felt guilty there weren't some healthier options ;)"}
{"text":"Tried the bacon and sauerkraut, absolutely delicious. The truffle and mushroom pierogies were unique, and well balanced, and of course, amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Not bad!  Got the classic pierogies with cheese and sour cream, boiled not fried.  I was surprised with how tasty they were!  I fully expected a heart-attack-on-a-plate but the pierogies were just perfectly boiled and the filling inside was not as dense and heavy as I imagined. The toppings complimented the pierogies nicely, couldn't have asked for anything more.  I haven't tried any of the other jazzed up variations but I'm sure they're delicious too.    On a side note the staff is extremely friendly and down to earth, I told them I wanted to walk and eat the pierogies and they packaged them perfectly for it instead of wrappinjg them up in a paper bag. Looking forward to more visits over the sunmer!"}
{"text":"Haven't had pierogi in a long long time and so decided to come here given all the great reviews! Perhaps my expectations were set too high, as I didn't find the food to be particularly good. That said, the service is excellent. Our waitress was so friendly, spunky, and had a great personality! She was bubbly and a gem. When I asked about substitutions, she said that she'd gladly substitute anything, and even though my Yelp check-in didn't work, she still gave us a 15% discount. You go, girl!  I, for some odd reason, was really craving brussel sprouts and so ordered the Cabbage Patch Kid, which came with fried brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes, ranch dressing, cheddar cheese, green onions, and of course, sour cream. I asked for the dressing on the side, and she gladly accommodated. I asked for the pierogi boiled. Meanwhile, my food date ordered the Smoking Pig Roast with fried pierogi. I had a bit, and the bacon was spectacular (although, to be fair, it's very difficult to mess up bacon).  I may have made the wrong decision to get the pierogi boiled, as they came as an utter mush. These pierogi are filled with only potatoes, and when they arrived, the skins were all mushy and stuck to one another. The pierogi were super dense and filling - in fact, I was only able to finish half the portion (4 of 8 pierogi). The brussel sprouts were good, but slightly too charred... Slightly on the burnt side. The onions were sweet, but extremely greasy. In fact, I found the entire dish a bit too oily - which is interesting given that I had the pierogi boiled.   I was a little disappointed, but the menu pairings are fun and innovative. Moreover, given the amazing service, I am tempted to give this place another try."}
{"text":"I live in buffalo, I know what real polish pierogi are and this place does not have them. However, it is still very good. We went here during one of our monthly trips to Toronto and although different, we were still impressed. I had mined topped with crab and lobster, delicious. My partner had the Miss. Piggy, also very good. If your from the US and used to the traditional perogi saut√©ed in in butter, onion and garlic, these might seam different. They are deep-fried and there for they are a little crunchy. You also have the option of having them boiled, healthier, I'm sure but probably no where near as good. This place is small, cozy and cheap. You get 8 little perogi topped for $8-$12 bucks. Our waiter was, friendly and the service was quick. This is a great little lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Very tasty! Shared the full-on pork one (fried) and mushroom (boiled) with a friend. A good combo, tasty and surprisingly light!! You don't roll out the door feeling ill like with regular poutine"}
{"text":"Bad experience at other restaurant lead me right into the waiting arms if loaded pierogi. Perfect flavors and textures. We sampled the boiled and deep fried. Both excellent. Plus the staff was amazing. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I had the Smoking Pig Roast and it was INCREDIBLE!! The pierogis were delicious and the bacon, cheddar, and pulled pork topping was everything I needed and more. Great prices, speedy service and wonderful staff/customer service. A must visit if you're in Toronto. I don't have a picture because I pretty much inhaled it."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon to try this place ($35) which included two drinks, two perogies (under $14) and a dessert to share. I ordered a loaded caesar (it was meh) and the mister got the mad dog (which was also meh). I got the Buffalo Chicken for my main and I loved it. The flavour was amazing and everything complimented each other - only complaint was the chicken was too hard. He got the \"oh yeah\" bacon with sauerkraut which I did not enjoy as I am not a fan of bacon or sauerkraut but he seemed to like it. For dessert, we ordered the sweet apple which was filled with sweet cheese topped with apples, cinnamon and whipped cream - I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was vanilla ice cream.  The service was great and super friendly. Atmosphere was relaxing - music wasn't too loud, lighting was perfect. Lots to look around the restaurant while his face is glued to his phone. Overall an amazing find. Will definitely come back to try the butter chicken and the catch!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Lots of different options. You can get fried and boiled mixed on a single plate which is great."}
{"text":"All I have to say is this place was a delight to visit and dine at.  The service was outstanding, welcoming, and engaging. Mix that with the wonderful pierogis. We had half boiled and half fried and they were both wonderful. Save room for dessert because that was very tasty too."}
{"text":"So I was sitting at work yesterday browsing Just Eat, trying to figure out what to get for lunch, when all of a sudden I see Loaded Pierogi and my search is over. I was so happy to see that I could order delivery from them.   This time I went The Buffalo Chicken with crispy pierogis because it is so good and the Ms. Piggy with classic pierogis to try something new. The pierogis survived the delivery and were as delicious as the first time I tried them in the restaurant. I would recommend the classic pierogis if you are ordering delivery because they keep better. Also if you refrigerate them and eat them the next day like I did, they reheat fine too. The sour cream came on the side which was good so you could dip the pierogis in it instead of it melting all over them on the way over.  I really enjoyed the Ms. Piggy, the pulled pork was really tender, saucy and flavourful and the goat cheese on top added a nice creaminess. I would definitely get this one again and have yet to find a version of loaded pierogis I don't like. Can't wait until the next time the craving hits and I order from here again."}
{"text":"I learned about this place around 2pm yesterday and went there for dinner around 6pm with high expectations. I'm happy to report that I was not disappointed! When we arrived there was still seating, but the place quickly filled up.   It's a nice, friendly environment - good for a casual date night or a group of friends getting together for food and drinks (kind in mind they only have one large table which can accommodate eight people). The music was nice and not too loud.  I ordered the Wild Mushroom & Truffle perogies and instantly knew that this place was going to become one of my go-to restaurants - YUM!! The amount of truffle oil was perfect and everything worked together nicely. My friend got The Catch and enjoyed it as well, although he didn't love the hollandaise. The other thing both of us were underwhelmed by was the house made sauerkraute - it was good, but it wasn't great.  Overall, the pierogis were delicious (and filling!), the atmosphere was wonderful, and the price was perfect.  I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to people and I hope it stays in business for a long time (although I fear it will become hard to get a table - thank goodness for the take-away option)!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the staff is quite friendly and entertaining (especially the bartender) however do keep in mind that you're paying quite a premium for premade pierogis with a few garnishes on top. They're trying to make a blue collar fast food more premium which in my opinion is always a recipe for disaster however I would definitely check it out, it's worth the occasional visit and you might as well try their house brew while you're there."}
{"text":"Super amazing food with such a friendly staff!! They will help you pick food AND drinks!! Awesome establishment inside. Such a cute ambiance! Absolutely loved my food and the drinks I got!! You can get them deep fried or broiled or even half and half which is so cool! Not expensive for all the food you get either !"}
{"text":"Service was impeccable and the food was really good.  Had the mushroom and truffle, the catch, and Donald Duck. The waitress knew that we were celebrating a friend's birthday and put a candle on the chocolate and strawberry pirogies that we ordered. It was a really sweet touch considering that we didn't ask for it.  Also felt that their Vodka flights were really good value too. You get to try 3 different kinds of Vodka for $12, Highly recommend Russian Standard Vodka (Bronze) and Pravda (Gold)."}
{"text":"Color me surprised that I wound up at an Eastern European joint on my trip to Toronto, but it happened, man. You usually won't catch me paying for anything remotely similar to Russian/Slavic foods because I eat that all the time, but this place caught my eye.  Great location, cute interior, and the nicest servers you've ever met! I was surprised by how much I liked hanging out here (and it's a great escape from the cold and snow). Anyway, I got the wild mushroom and truffle pierogi (half fried, half boiled); I ended up with this because, to my surprise, the cabbage patch did not have cabbage in it, which is a major bummer. Also, for those who don't get it, the toppings go on TOP of the potato pierogis. I thought they got stuffed inside. My bad. Still very tasty. Couldn't really tell the difference between fried and boiled with all the toppings on them, though.   The portion looks smallish, but it's heavy food--and very delicious! I almost wish I hadn't gone for such a froufrou option because YES, PLEASE BACON AND CARAMELIZED ONIONS, MMMMMM! But it was very, very good. I would definitely return. And everyone was supremely nice. You've got a fan in me!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp trying to find a restaurant for Saturday lunch in the esplanade area. Its next to Hanks, looks to be the same owner. Was not a fan of pierogis but saw that the reviews were high and the toppings looked good. Decided to try it out and boy am I glad I did!!  Decor is tasteful, dimly lit with booths. Service was nice. Pierogies ahhhmazing. My friend had the buffalo chicken and I had the smoking pig roast on fried pierogies. Meat and mixture of toppings with the pierogies was sooo delicious. The serving size was reasonable. Had to take half of my order to go.  Definitely will be back when in the area."}
{"text":"I don't post on Yelp much, but I came here to say this. I've lived in this city for 12 years and the playlist that you had on tonight was by far the worst, most horrid, abrasive, mangle of shitty pop tunes that I've heard in any kind of restaurant/bar/anything. I didn't mind your perogies and I like your beer list, but I'd rather be shot than listen to an hour of that music again. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The amount of toppings depends on how generous your chef is feeling. Uber eats brought my friend \"The Catch\" with a big heaping of crab/onion/peppers which I tried and it was delicious so I thought $14 for loaded perogies would be worth. When I ordered \"The Catch\" again via Ubereats I was disappointment with the skimpy amount of crab. Not sure if I'll be doing Ubereats for this joint again. Also not sure if I'll be going to the physical location to eat."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars - unique pierogi flavours, good variety of alcoholic beverages served in a casual atmosphere.  The Pierogi's are pretty good but I definitely can't say they are one of Toronto's top 3 (Best is Cafe Polonez). That said, I still enjoyed my meal on two separate visits.  You can pick fried or boiled. For me this is a no brainer, boiled all the way. This may come down to personal preference but I think frying a pierogi is a sin.   We always order a bunch of options to share. Some quick thoughts on a few I tried:  - Buffalo Chicken: Nice buffalo wing sauce taste with chunks of breaded chicken breast on top of the pierogi's. A good choice.  - My fav. is Cabbage patch: served with sour cream and lots of brussel sprouts (warning - don't order if you hate brussel sprouts).  - Butter Chicken: Not my choice. To be honest, I never had butter chicken so can't comment on the authenticity.  - Baba's Classic: Can't go wrong with the standard served with onions and sour cream. Always a solid choice.  - Thai Ginger Steak: I enjoyed this but my three friends didn't like it all (Bonus - more for me). I thought the steak was good but maybe not the best pierogi pairing. I ate the steak and then the pierogi's.   - Bacon, Sauerkraut & Oh Yeah Bacon: The name says it all. It was good but I didn't like the Bacon - not sure why, it had an odd taste (and I love Bacon).  Service was excellent and friendly on both visits. The place is really comfortable and casual providing booth and bar type seating.  Bonus - they had 4-5 good craft beers. Menu also included a few wines, cocktails and a huge Vodka menu.  I will be back given its close proximity to work. I would rank it 4th / 5th on my list of Toronto's best Pierogi's. That said - they deserve bonus points / ranking for the variety of unique flavours, above average drink menu and cool atmosphere.  BK"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Our server was so amazing, so friendly! Took the time to review the menu with us and even suggested a unique concoction that my boyfriend got AND LOVED! (Buffalo chicken wings with bacon added) I had the mushroom pierogies...they were TO DIE FOR! Still dreaming about them! They also have plenty of vegetarian options which is great for us veggos. $5 beer and awesome specials....we will most definitely be returning here!"}
{"text":"Brand new, cozy little pierogi place!  You get an option or boiled pierogis or crispy. Lots of toppings to add on top.   Must visit if you like pierogis.   The cocktails have two ounces of vodka (mainly vodka based drinks). If you're note a vodka fan, they have beers as well."}
{"text":"My partner is obsessed with pierogis, so when LP opened on Queen it was a must go.   I was actually surprised by the experience. The decor was very charming; dimly lit, candle sticks on the table and minimal seating. There is a small open bar towards the back and to the right of it a chalkboard with the menu and sides, complete with artwork of the food.   Being our first time we grilled the waiter about the menu and any suggestions he had. He recommended doing the pierogi's half classic and half crispy. Although it was an ideal suggestion at the time to try both styles, I think moving forward I would just get the crispy one mainly because of the texture.   As a vegetarian, I chose the Wild Mushroom and Truffle and Oh.My.God. It was good, great even. There was a perfect portion of pierogi-to-toppings ratio. With four different types of mushrooms, each bite was different and the black truffle sour cream just tied all the textures and flavors together. The \"mixture\" of it all wasn't dry by any means and had me licking the bowl by the end. It went perfectly with the suggested glass of wine.  This is a great place, almost \"hole in the wall\"-like with options to satisfy everyone's eating preferences and cravings."}
{"text":"Good pierogies. The only problem is that, for me, i found the toppings to be a bit heavy. I would prefer that they have a bit of a refreshing edge (aside from the sour cream).  We've always ordered in and our in-store experience may be different, so I'll update when we've visited the store."}
{"text":"The portions are huge and so flavourful. All the pierogies are the same and then they just add the different toppings (at least the 3 that we tried). They also have occasional groupons or other food vouchers,  that make for good value."}
{"text":"I will start by saying I was disappointed by the misleading \"loaded\" pierogi name. I was under the impression that the ingredients were stuffed into the pierogi themselves however they are simply places on top of them. Regardless, the food was delicious. I ordered the philly cheese steak and was happy with it. Didn't have a very \"American\" taste to it which I was disappointed by. The meat seemed to have been marinated in Thai spices it seems.   The restaurant is very tight and not much seating. If you don't get a booth I could see how sitting on stools would be uncomfortable. Disappointed considering it seems like a sit-down restaurant."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting. Did not like this one bit. Yuckyyy. Heavy. I make better pierogies and for way cheaper. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from one of the Toronto based food blogs on Instagram, seeing as how my girlfriend loves porgies I took her right away, I personally am not a huge fan, but I believe u should try every thing twice.  The place is very neat, not a ton of seating, and is the half of the wine bar next door, both share the same owners as well as washrooms as I have been told.  The good was great, or as great as progies could get, mine was deep fried and topped with lobster, the sauce was perfect and the lobster was noticeable!  My girlfriend loved the place and she knows her porgies!  I my self loved the service more then any thing ! Don't get me wrong food was great, but the service was killer! The male server I had would do a lap around the restaurant, and make sure he was with in arms reach in case I needed some thing, but with out annoying us and asking us if very thing is okay repeatedly. My water went empty, it was full before I could look up. Very nice polite server! On point! I did get the meat the owner at the very end of my meal as I was leaving and did let him know.  Now there's always some bad however, I would have stayed for drinks after the meal, but we both found the stools very uncomfortable, and the lighting was a little off, I did love the interior tho, very nice looking, but some times it's just that \"nice looking\"  We will be back, the place was well managed and well represented by their servers, that is how you run a resturant."}
{"text":"This place is great. I was fatter when writing my last review. These portions are more than enough to fill up a normal human."}
{"text":"Was taken here for my birthday and was very impressed! After an initial round of vodka tasting, I had butter chicken pierogis, while my wife had the pulled pork pierogis with a side of red-cabbage sauerkraut (which she loved!). I tried both and knew that Loaded Pierogi may become a regular stop on my ever-expanding collection of Faves. Having lived in Saskatchewan for a time, I feel I know a good pierogi when I have one - these are very good ones!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with 2 other friends. The place isn't huge, so would be hard for large groups to come without a reservation.  We sat on the side with high chairs (thankfully there was room!)   The concept of the place is obviously perogies!! Loads of them!! That's all they serve =D  Very cool variety, including some such as surf and turf, breakfast perogies, and even dessert ones!  We ended up ordering buffalo chicken, and the catch. Portions aren't that big, but filling enough. I thought I would be more wowed though unforunately I thought they weren't anything special. I also thought that there wasn't enough filling in the perogy so most of the time, I was just eating dough."}
{"text":"I think I'm going to be sick. I was SO excited to try this place out and LOVE pierogi. But, I was sadly disappointed. Both my husband and I. We ordered the Donald Duck and Smoked BBQ Pig. I don't know if it was what we ordered or the time on day 4:00pm or the day Sunday...but I wouldn't recommend it and won't try it again. They must be frozen pierogi. Costco has way better frozen pierogi. So sad. So so sad!!!"}
{"text":"Loaded Pierogi is so, so good. Great little spot on corner of Queen and Niagara. Terrific service. Amazing food. The Breakfast Western and Porky Pig are my favorite for sure. Everything works well together. I come a few times a week and it is perfect every time."}
{"text":"Ok service and presentation but overall quality is not impressive. It's basic food that I thought would have been made better. You could do the same thing at home with frozen pierogis."}
{"text":"So many options!!! Had the mushroom, truffle perogies with size order of Brussels sprouts... So good!! Happy this is a neighbourhood local, will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while, and I am glad that I did. Came here with a friend and we decided to order two different dishes to share.  The staff was friendly and explained the menu to us. I was expecting this to be more of a fast food take out place, but it's an actual restaurant with seating. Came here on a Friday and it gets busy pretty fast. Luckily there was a table open and we got seated right away. The food came out in a reasonable time.  The pierogi base is the same, just the toppings differ. I loved the Wild Mushroom & Truffle pierogis. This was delicious and definitely the highlight of the meal. The toppings included a variety of mushrooms: Portobello, oyster, shitaki, and button mushrooms with garlic, thyme, goat cheese, truffle oil, onions, and black truffle sour cream and green onions. We got the half crispy and half steamed pierogis. I enjoyed the crispy ones better. The portion size is good and quite filling. I love truffles, and if you are a truffle fan I would recommend getting this dish. It was yummy!  We also ordered the Smoking Pig Roast. This came will pulled pork, bacon, chorizo sausage, cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions. I didn't enjoy this dish as much. I found the pulled pork a little on the sweet side for me. I could have happily had another order of the truffle pierogis instead.  Overall I enjoyed the experience here and would be back for more!"}
{"text":"I've had better is basically how I'd sum up my experience.  I went in with the excitement of eating at a pierogi restaurant, and my excitement was dashed pretty quickly when the waitress couldn't be bothered to leave her conversation to seat me, instead just waving me off.  I also was not worthy of being served water until my friend showed up a little later.  The food was ok, but not spectacular, and certainly no better than buying pre-made pierogis from the frozen food isle.  I don't think I'll be back, I certainly don't want to interrupt the waitstaff's conversations after all."}
{"text":"We really wanted to go check out another brunch place in the area but the wait was over an hour long so unexpectedly we ended up here and never regretted that decision.  The portions are not gigantic but very very well made. All the pierogies have the same filling of potatoes but the toppings come in so many varieties that we ended up ordering quite a few plates to share between 4 of us.  There is a good selection for vegetarians too (mushroom, cheese and basic one that I don't remember because I ended up in food coma after all the food) They also have sweet options that I am looking forward to trying in the future as we had no space in our bellies to try these too. In addition to great food experience our waiter - Kirk - was extremely helpful and full of positive energy that made the whole visit even nicer and welcoming."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE BEST! They make the tastiest meals. I ordered the \"Surf and Turf Pierogi\" it was so delicious, I had to order a second plate and a To-Go. Don't blame me, I'm sucker for food.   Also, The service and ambiance was really good. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is a little difficult to find, being tucked away and sharing space with another restaurant. But its well worth the time and money if you need a pierogi fix.   They serve a pretty wide range of pierogis and other things to spice up the flavor. I had the pierogis served with duck. The duck was tasty and crispy and the pierogis were just OK.   My main complaints about the pierogis here are founded in their cooking style and how doughy they feel. They have 2 options for cooking your pierogis: boiled or deep fried. The traditional way I have seen it was boiled and lightly fried in butter. The solely boiled method just felt unfinished to me. Maybe because I was expecting it to be cooked in the more traditional sense, it seemed to be a bit heavy on the dough side.   And lastly, the beer selection is pretty limited, but at least its fairly cheap ($5-6/glass)."}
{"text":"Yelp had a 15% discount code which i showed the waiter - he said he would input it but didnt and i only realized after i paid. Food was mediocre - always thought pierogis we potatoe and cheese filled dumpings. Inside was dry potatoe."}
{"text":"I came with my bf on a Groupon because the concept of pierogis with toppings really intrigued us. And we were not disappointed!!! Some of the best I've ever had. Our Groupon included two entrees, two drinks and a dessert for $35.00. He got the Mad Dog and I got the Eastern Promises drinks, they were good, if a bit weak. But the food was amazing, I had the Smoking Pig Roast and it was absolutely LOADED with pulled pork, bacon and cheese. My boyfriend had the Philly steak and he really enjoyed it. The prices are reasonable and the general ambience is nice in the restaurant. I would definitely come back next time we are craving great pierogis!"}
{"text":"I needed a place to eat lunch, and this was super close to my hotel. I've had pierogis before, but the idea of a restaurant devoted entirely to them intrigued me. So I decided to give it a try.  I ordered The Catch, pierogis topped with lobster, crab, and hollandaise sauce. I added sauteed wild mushrooms. It was delicious. They were lightly fried so the crispyness was just prefect. And they were so flavorful.  I even ordered some sweet pierogis for dessert, topped with strawberry compote and chocolate sauce. Divine!!  I totally recommend this place. Reasonably priced, and awesome food!!"}
{"text":"I love to try new foods. I've tried pierogies before but never in a place that specializes in them. So I was glad to have found this place.   Here they sell meal pierogies, dessert pierogies, and beer. The meal ones range from $8-$16. Comes with 8 pierogies and topped with various toppings. The dessert ones are 4 pieces and topped with heavenly sweets. All the meal pierogies are standard potato ones. The only difference is with what they top it with.  I like the variety of toppings they have and no matter what kind of eater you are, you should be able to find one that fits you. They have a wide selection of alcohol too. We've tried 4 of them (roast chicken, the catch, philly steak, and the pork one).  My only complaint about this place are just the prices. The higher end ones are not worth your money imo. It's definitely not a bang for your buck kind of place. And personally I think pierogies are better when the \"toppings\" are stuffed inside instead. But that's a small thing as it tastes good either way. The atmosphere is casual and almost reminds me of Wrvst."}
{"text":"I really liked the BBQ Philly Cheese Steak sauce but I also enjoyed the simplicity of the surf & turf.  The steak was sliced and I enjoyed the pieces of crab that were in the pile of pierogis.  I thought we would get full really fast considering there were a lot of carbs on the table, but we managed to finish all of this and still have comfortable room in our stomachs for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love Pierogi's and I don't get them very often.  These were deelish! I had the traditional, because I am a purist. If I lived in Canada I would go all the time, but alas I'm here in the U.S. of A and will have to settle for Pierogiless eats."}
{"text":"My new favourite source of comfort food. I want to go back and try all the pierogi variations! Everything is pretty well designed, good cozy atmosphere and the portions were perfect. Great for a casual date night. We got the Donald Duck and and the Kicking Kimchi, both of which were very delicious, a warm hug on a cold day.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"So this was a great experience. Had the Mushroom Truffle and it was pretty good. Apparently the best thing on the menu. Wouldn't say it was amazing. Would have loved some spice options. This is a place that really needs a home made hot sauce blend as opposed to sriracha.    Service was great and friendly.   They had a recycling bin and a separate one for black containers. The guy working there told us it didn't matter where we put our garbage when it all went into one anyway. Disappointed: Why have deceptive containers to make it look like you're trying to be environmentally conscious? The answer I got was that they didn't pay for the recycling company to stop by this place."}
{"text":"This was a fairly interesting place. At least to me. I enjoy pirogies. But I have never had authentic ones. Not that these are authentic or anything. According to my date, these are are Russian style, with the potato filling. Whatever style they are, authentic or otherwise, the actual pirogi was yummy. I had mine boiled while he had his fried. The fried ones looked a bit too doughy to me, which is why I went with boiled. I got the classic, which was sour cream and onions. There were A LOT of onions. He had the chicken and avocado pirogies. So his pirogies were tipped with chicken, avocado and what looked like pieces of bacon? I think we both enjoyed our dishes, but neither of us found it appealing enough to return in the future. It's a very niche restaurant. We would have been more impressed if the pirogies were stuffed with chicken and avocado (or the other flavour combos). But these are just \"loaded\".. On top. The service was fast and friendly. It was pretty quiet when we walked in, but I can see it getting busy based on its location. The hallway to the washroom connects to the restaurant next door, so don't get lost!"}
{"text":"Greasy and lacking flavour, didn't find too much here of value with the exception that the food is very reasonably priced and service was friendly and efficient. Had the philly cheesesteak pierogi. Rather than loading up on cheese, it had an awkward sauce on it that didn't really jive with the rest of the dish. Skimped on the bell peppers. That said, pricing is spot on and they have some great specials with beer pairings.  Just a tip--cut down on grease and get your pierorgies steamed/boiled. This was actually a much more flavourful option and made them taste less starchy overall."}

{"text":"If I have to fly 750 miles again to try the rest of the menu, then SO BE IT. Had the Smoking Pig Roast; totally recommend. Husband had the Buffalo Chicken and wouldn't let me try it. He ate it all. Now I have to try that too."}
{"text":"We went to the Queen and Niagara location. I did a mix of the boiled and fried. Both were delicious, although the fried were better just cuz they were fried. The service and drink selection was really good. The only feedback is they need to put in a curtain or something to keep the cold air out. With two doors in a small location anytime someone comes in or out you get a chill."}
{"text":"I looooooove pierogis! I knew I had to try this place out when I found out it existed. I'm happy to report that it stood up to my expectations.  First off, I was expecting a fast-food atmosphere where you have to wait at the counter until your food is ready. However, Loaded Pierogi is actually a casual sit-down restaurant that also offers take-away, delivery, and online ordering services. The decor here managed to make the place feel homey and comfortable while still maintaining a trendy ambiance.  All of the pierogis are offered boiled or fried (your choice) and are generously heaped with toppings. I counted four different vegetarian options but you always have the opportunity to create your own pierogi masterpiece by choosing from a wide selection of add-ons. I chose the Baba's classic pierogi for myself with added house-made sauerkraute. It was outstanding. So much care was put into such a quick, simple dish. I was totally content after finishing it.  Aside from pierogis, this restaurant also has an impressive offering of different vodkas from all around the world. They are listed by bronze, silver, and gold pricing. Pro-tip? they have a flight where you can choose one of each for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"A friend and I got some Cabbage Patch pierogis to go from here on a Saturday night and they were super delicious. The staff were so nice and explained the menu, types of pierogi, and offered us water while we waited for our order. I would love to try some of the other pierogi stylings another time."}
{"text":"This place is okay, nothing special. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken and the chicken was overfried. It tasted like it was re-fried because it was sitting around for a while. I expected more since the price is quite high for what you get. Despite this, the service was great so thumbs up for that! All in all, I don't think I'd come back."}
{"text":"Loved that little gem located South of Front Street on Church Street.  Fresh made Pierogis on the spot. Quick, friendly service. Good prices."}
{"text":"My experience at the Loaded Pierogi was unfortunately disappointing. I got the Mushroom and Truffle on Crispy pierogis. The onions were too tough, barely caramelized and cut too thickly. The flavour of the entire dish really wasn't all that great. Definitely not what I was expecting. Also, I ordered a glass of wine. Three different servers comfirmed what kind of wine I ordered, and my guest and I requested the wine on two occasions, but it never came. When I got my bill, I had been charged for 2 glasses of wine. My server even forgot about our waters. Overall the service is unnattentive and the food is lacking. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The butter chicken perogis were so delicious. Sizes were really good and staff was very friendly. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Generally good however pretty salty. Also I don't think the \"lobster and crab\" are  actually the real thing. It tastes like the crab sticks  made of some kind of processed fish. Just a heads up...I was pretty disappointed with that."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned it is great to see a place like this open.   The space is quite cosy and comfortable but a little confusing as it shares an entryway with another establishment.  The service was very friendly and that alone is worth a repeat visit.   I had the porky pig and dessert pierogis, both fried. I will need to return to try the boiled version.  I'm no expert on pierogis but I enjoyed these. Not as good as all the hype suggested, but totally decent.   You should check them out."}
{"text":"What a great concept and this little place delivers. Great flavour combinations, fast and friendly service and some fun beers. My wife had the porky pig which was delicious. I had the Bacon, sauerkraut and oh yeah, bacon\" with two types of bacon,  beautiful crisp lardons, cheddar cheese and a truly excellent house made sauerkraut which beautifully enhanced the other ingredients without overwhelming. Four out of five only because it would be good if they had anything green to accompany - even if just a couple  of different simple salads.  Will definitely go back next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"\"My steamed potato pierogis came loaded with caramelized onions, melted cheddar and some green onions on top.\" \"This slow cooked dish was meant to be enjoyed slowly as well\" \"The quietness and dim lights of Loaded Pierogi made it perfect for a casual lunch and a catch up with a friend.\"  Just a few bites of our short & sweet experience."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying pierogies. I think they're probably not my thing but the concept was cool. The staff were friendly but the service was so slow I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Great concept if you're into food truck/street food fare. But if you're a pierogi purist, stay away. The basic boiled pierogi with potato and cheese is a good safe bet. But although the other loaded options are enticing, I find they miss the mark. Don't expect the pierogi to be stuffed with exotic flavours, but rather topped with them. So the pierogi itself is plain and either boiled or deep fried and then the rest of the ingredients are placed on top. I tried the buffalo chicken and got the pierogies deep fried as per the server's recommendation. I discovered deep fried pierogies are definitely not my thing! I'm open to unconventional preparations of culinary classics, but have to say they do not do the pierogi any favours. Sorry Loaded Pierogi, really wanted to love this enough to become a regular."}
{"text":"The food is ok, however the often forget ingredients. Important ingredients.   How do you forget avocado in your avocado chicken?  What is really bad however is the service. They really could not care less and would rather socialize with each other.   Best of all is that they are constantly outside smoking in front of customers."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick lunch having seen this place from the outside many times.  Wow.  The pierogies are amazingly well cooked with a wide variety of meats and sauces as a main and they also have amazing dessert pierogies.  I had the buffalo chicken pierogies half deep fried and half boiled.  The chicken was cubed and crispy and the buffalo sauce was bang on.  The apple and spice dessert pierogies were absolutely amazing.  Whipped cream, cinnamon apples and just the right temperature.   We will be back.  Amazing experience."}
{"text":"I got their BREAKFAST WESTERN ($12) and decided on this dish solely based on my hollandaise sauce obsession. The menu offers many different types of toppings to go with their pierogis with the option of getting them fried or steamed. My fatass likes anything fried so, that was the obvious choice for me. I would definitely go back to try other combinations!   @wheresmyhoneypot"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love pierogies? My pal mentioned that she wanted to go out for pierogies, but didn't know where to go in Toronto. I went on Yelp a couple of days ago and found Loaded Pierogi. We decided to check out this 'Hot and New' restaurant this afternoon while everyone else in the city was checking out the Santa Clause Parade. This place is small and cozy; they share a space with Hanks so make sure that you go through L.P.'s doors instead. The menu is extensive with a variety of unique pieorgi dishes, including butter chicken, kimuchi, and cheeseburger. We found the 'Baba's Classic' to be the winner; sometimes simple is the best. However, we also enjoyed the Cheeseburger Pierogies. L.P. also has a bar with a Vodka Flight for $12. Price points here are super reasonable considering the amount of food you get. We found service to be quite good as well. Can't wait to return and try their other pieorgi dishes.  Good for: lunch, pierogies, drinks, take out"}
{"text":"We went for lunch on a Tuesday around 1pm and we had the whole place to ourselves! I couldn't tell why though, the atmosphere was modern with lots of character and the wait staff were very friendly and really top notch. The food itself was also great. The daily specials are the way to go for a cold pint :) definitely a warm comfort food type meal, but I didn't feel stuffed, I left feeling very satisfied. Would definitely go back to try different flavours! Surf and Turf was good as well as the butter chicken!"}
{"text":"I visited the new location at Gerrard Street East and I was extremely impressed! We tried the Pig Roast and then the Kimchi pierogies and they were both delicious! The atmosphere was lively and our server as very attentive. Drink selection was also decent. I'll be back to try the other dishes! This is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself looks nice and clean.   Not a huge place.  Maybe 9-10 tables for two.  Only one person was waitering which didn't seem to be enough. We waited a bit to have our dinner order taken.  Then we waited a long time to have our dinner delivered to us.  Other tables of people who arrived after us received their meals and finished by the time we were brought our food.  We were told the that our food order didn't get submitted to the kitchen.  We also had to wait for our bill. Two hours for our peiogi dinner which I think is really is unacceptable.  We only received less than 15% discount for our wait.  The waiter said he applied a 20% discount.  But checking the receipt it was only 15% discount and only on 3 out of the 4 items.  A bit disappointed in this!  Food wise, all pierogies can be boiled, fried or toy can choose 1/2 and 1/2.  We ordered the mushroom and the buffalo chicken.  The buffalo chicken was ok but the mushroom was bland.   Will not be back."}
{"text":"OMG!  I haven't had a pierogi for a long time and this was as good as it gets!  We had the basic pierogi with classic sour cream and caramelized onions. Delicious!  Of course we followed it up with dessert....sweet polish style cheese filled fried pierogi dough; sweet cooked apples and caramel covered the fried dough... Heaven!  And , they serve local beer!"}
{"text":"Tried this place after a recommendation from a friend. Seating was limited on a weeknight, so the wait time was long. The pieorgi's can come either boiled or fried, I tried both and do recommend the fried over boiled due to taste and texture. The pierogi filling is the same regardless of what style/toppings you order. Overall the pierogi's are very tasty and the portion size is good and fairly priced.  The waiters were a bit slow in their service, they are always in the back or at the bar it sometimes took some effort to get some service."}
{"text":"A few weeks ago, a friend of mine went to the Loaded Pierogi downtown, so recently I tried this location nearer to me on Gerrard St. It was not yet 6pm when I arrived, so the place was still pretty empty, but more people would come later including a few pick-up orders (I think one was UberEats). Inside was nice enough, not fancy, but a little 'stylish' I guess: lots of dark wood, a large hand-written chalkboard menu on one wall, a small bar in front of the kitchen. The server was very nice, he explained how the pierogies are served, and came by to chat every now and then.  As many people have pointed out in their reviews, the pierogies are not actually stuffed with anything except potatoes; they can be boiled or fried, with the extra ingredients on top. While this was one strike against them, it was really the only drawback I found. I had the Kicking Kimchi dish, maybe 7 pierogies with spicy cabbage, wasabi sauce, green onions and sour cream. Lots of flavours mixed together, and the pierogies themselves pick up the other flavours as well. They also have choices such as butter chicken, duck, bacon or pulled pork and seafood; my friend had chosen chicken and avocado. They also have two dessert pierogies, apple-caramel and strawberry-chocolate.  The business info in the margin indicates no TV, but that's definitely not correct, as I sat after my meal and had a couple drinks while I watched the hockey game. All their cocktails on the menu are vodka-based, but I didn't really notice what else they had at the bar. The pierogi dishes are between $8-16 each, and with drinks I paid $29 in total. A pretty good place for a little comfort food, and I'll probably return to at least try one of the desserts."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon to try this place out. The perogies were just ok and the atmosphere is a bar. Went on a Friday night at peak dinner time and didn't need to wait to be seated (first warning). I had the mushroom which tasted ok. My husband had pulled pork which he said was weak. A dessert was thrown in and we had strawberry and chocolate. It was a hideous dessert almost not edible. Everything tasted very processed, like a fast food joint. It reminded us of a Fancy Frank's for perogies. I dislike fast food, so unless that's what you are expecting, I would stay away. The regular prices are steep for the quality of food. My husband felt hungry after the dinner portion but there was nothing else on the menu to buy - no app options. I am surprised at all the good reviews for this place. I hoped it would be a lot better and will not be going back."}
{"text":"This place was awesome and perfect for our Sunday afternoon stroll in the neighbourhood. Pierogies really are a comfort food and any place that can take a comfort food staple and step it up a notch is definitely worth a visit. Loaded Pierogi delivered! My husband and I \"splurged\" by ordering the Donald Duck and the Surf n Turf. I found the portions just right - enough carb-heavy Perogies to crazy toppings. I warn you to the slightly confusing entrance because when we first got there we got seated for Hank's next door and had to leave to go to the right place. At least we had the decency to look embarrassed ;)"}
{"text":"Came here after getting denied at DW Alexander cause they didn't open for another 10 mins (both have been on my bookmarks for awhile) and Biffs Bistro, despite their $1 Oyster I wasn't feeling their service and mood.   Ordered their $10 baba's classic (original) peirogies and a pint awesome special :) they have an extensive menu with one whole page just dedicated to vodkas which is pretty cool.   The server was friendly and accommodating, he even offered to boil half and fry the other half of my small order so I could both options.   I was just at European deli in the St.  Lawrence market for their 6 for $2.50 but I'm willing to pay triple the price for these because of the nice atmosphere,  great service and cool interior.   The peirogies are a little doughy for me but the flavor was there. The fried ones were my choice over the 2.  Would come back to try their other outrageous flavors and vodka flights!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Had half boiled and half fried kimchi. Service was quick and staff very friendly"}
{"text":"Great place to have some great comfort food with some friends and just have a nice time talking, etc. Would come again and recommend others to go too. For sure the overall plating is enough to make you full even thought it looks deceiving for just $8 or so."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, atmosphere, and prices. Highly recommend. The service was awesome too"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is great. I love perogies and they do them up tasty and delicious.  I love the porky pig , it's my favourite. Glad this tasty joint opened up in the hood."}
{"text":"Totally delicious. Service was great and so was the food. I've been a few times since my original review and I just love this place. Good service and good food."}
{"text":"Came to the restaurant to find that it was closed without a sign or message stating why. Stop by on a Thursday at 645 pm. Called the alternate location and they didn't even know it was closed... so confused and disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food. Nice place, fast, and the vodka flight is a good option. Go with the tag, Dillon, and loon."}
{"text":"Great service.  Food is as good as the other locations.  I had the Bacon Saurkraut and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Was pretty impressed by this place. Wasn't sure how you can make anything special out of only pierogi dishes but this place did.  I tried the bacon and the mushroom pierogi dishes, both crispy. They were amazing. Fairly filling and tasted great. I enjoyed the bacon dish over the mushrooms.   Haven't had much experience with pierogi's but this place I'd recommend. Also not a bad price for their dishes."}
{"text":"4 stars for the taste of the food and the portion size. I went here to eat without knowing what pierogi was. I found out I liked them. The pierogi taste good, the portion (8pieces) is also good and the topping (I got chicken with avocado) was sublime. The little pieces of chicken were seriously one of the best I've tasted. I did however think that all the toppings are heavy, protein-based. This costs them 1 star. I would've liked more light topping choices like veggies or herbs or something. The now existing menu made me feel like I was in a  guy's restaurant. Perhaps I was."}
{"text":"Tried new Gerrard location. Was looking forward to it. Stupidly didn't ask what the filling was, assumed it was cheese or potato. Turns out they are all made with potato and onion. A lot of onion. I had asked for no chopped onions on my order, that would be the servers first clue, the dish came with very undercooked carmelized onions, i picked them all off, there were a lot. I told him i was allergic to uncooked or under cooked onion, he offered to cook the picked off onions until they were crispy. I said no thanks its ok, clue number two, i actually said out loud that I was allergic to raw or uncooked onions. This might have been the moment to explain that the pierogis contained onion. Nope!  The filling ingredients are not listed on the menu. After eating one I realized the joint error. Server awkwardly apologized, told me i would get a discount. He brought me the bill. Very weird that I was charged at all, even weirder that he didn't ask me if i would be okay. Hopefully this can be chalked up to a comedy of errors. Maybe one day they will have some that don't contain onion inside. Also don't make another silly assumption that i did. when i was offered boiled or fried or half and half. He meant 4 boiled and 4 fried. I thought he meant boiled then slightly fried. Which is how they are typically prepared in a ukranian home. I own my responsibility in this equation. Maybe I should have asked more questions? Recommendations to resto: list ingredients on menu, offer alternative filling, consider boiling then slightly pan fry. They would taste much better that way. Recommendations to future customers: ask for boiled, deep fried ones are not great. The interior is nice and it looked like they offered nice cocktails and the price point is good. Unless you are being charged for something you did not eat!"}
{"text":"I visited Loaded Pierogi a couple days ago on a freezing Toronto night and it was hands down one of my favorite experiences in the city. The Mushroom Truffle Pierogi is by far the best one! I also ordered the Ms. Piggy - it was a little too sweet for me but still a solid option nonetheless. If you're on Queen Street definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Been craving pierogi lately so decided to check this place out. Had the wild mushroom and truffle and they were really good. Since you can mix between fried and boiled I got half and half of each though (even though it's not as healthy) I think I prefer the fried cause it has a better crunch and taste to it!  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back and trying several other flavours."}
{"text":"A little late in reviewing but that's how the potatoes fall.  My friend and I were early early for a dinner elsewhere but we were hungry so we decided to stop in here for a small bite.  We ordered one plate of pierogis (you get if I remember correctly 8 pieces).  We chose the mushroom one, half boiled and half fried and it was delicious.  The mushrooms had a great meaty texture to them - they didn't get soggy/over cooked in the dish.  The mushroom sauce and sour cream lent the perfect bite to the pierogis.  The staff is super friendly and if you check in on Yelp you get 15% off your order.  Seriously what could be better?"}
{"text":"We had no problem getting in on a Saturday at lunch because everyone wanted brunch next door at Hank's.  Amazing pierogis! It didn't seem like a lot of food, but it filled us to the top!  My bf got the Smoke Pig Roast (with boiled pierogis - her prefers boiled) - it was a mixture of pork (sausage, bits, pulled). I got Ms.Piggy (with fried pierogis) - apple bbq pulled pork w/ goat cheese. You can't have pierogies with a heaping mound of sour cream!"}
{"text":"It's just OK. Nothing special. Might be a good place for a quick lunch. Food is a bit salty overall."}
{"text":"What a novel concept in this city! I love perogies so imagine my happiness when I found this place through groupon, and got to try it out tonight.   First things first: the groupon (valid for 2 entrees, 2 drinks, and 1 dessert... Silly, it should be valid for a price amount) was not worthwhile for a pescatarian nondrinker like myself, even after asking the kitchen/bar to come up with some virgin drinks. The bill for my $35 groupon came out to a whopping... $41. And I was walking out stuffed, drinks still on the table. (I would have been better off buying on my own, but am I bitter? Nooooooooo... OK mildly)  On the bright side, this means that prices are actually quite reasonable! Entrees $8-16, dessert $7.  We ordered the lobster/crab perogies (delicate, but I would have preferred chunks of seafood rather than shreds - was I eating imitation? Ew.) And the truffle mushroom perogies (scrumptious, with just the right amount of truffle, but I might go with a less ranchy sauce... imho). The perogies themselves are delectable -perfect soft and fluffy but not sticky mushy texture! And the servings are VERY filling. Their hollandaise sauce is very delicate and mildly sweet - I'm a fan.   Note: you can get your perogies fried or boiled. The oil for frying also fries the duck, so vegetarians beware.   I initially thought this was a largely meat-based menu (it is meat heavy), but there are kimchi, mushroom, and brussel  sprouts options, as well as the classic, and the lobster/crab for seafood. Better than expected.  Only 2 dessert options: strawberry compote & chocolate, and apple cinnamon. We tried the strawberry, and the perogies come fried or baked. It was nice, but nothing to write home about. Again, the texture of the perogies, even crisp, was on the money.   The service was good, the food was prompt, and the server was friendly and helpful.   Merits a revisit :)"}
{"text":"Mass produced pierogi that were freezer burned and dry. You would think that the toppings would help moisten them but no such luck."}
{"text":"Service was great, but food wasn't wow me. I ordered 3 different pierogi and buffalo chicken was too dry and very small diced chicken."}
{"text":"Fast service, great pierogis, and neat toppings. Would return in the future if we are down here."}
{"text":"Loaded Pierogi was at the Artisan Food Market at Harbourfront on the weekend. So I tried their Butter Chicken Pierogies ($8). They were ok. It was basically plain pierogies with just potatoes inside. And a little bit of butter chicken with sauce on top. Wished there was a different filling inside to make it more interesting."}
{"text":"Great concept with very unique flavour pairings.  My friend and I shared the mushroom pierogi's and the classic.  Both were absolutely delicious.  My friend is a vegetarian, but I was able to get a side of bacon to add to mine.    The service was friendly.  Before coming I didn't realize that this was a bar as well, but that's always a plus.  Love that you can choose between boiled and fried.    A couple of suggestions:    1.  Have a few other things on the menu if someone in the group doesn't want pierogi's.  My friend and I shared two plates and we could have eaten a bit more (like a side salad or something), but another full plate of pierogi's would be too much.  2.  Have some tasters or samplers - I've never worked in a kitchen, so this may be too difficult but it would have been nice to sample a pierogi from a couple of the types before I ordered a full plate."}
{"text":"After reading all the raving reviews I was excited to try this place but alas it was a disappointment. We were seated promptly. The service was good and we placed our orders quickly. I think it was just that the food did not match my expectations. I was expecting to see the pierogies stuffed with the fancy fillings instead of them just being dumped on top.   I tried the porky pig and it was ok. Nothing to write home about. The wild mushroom and truffle oil was a letdown. You couldn't even smell the truffle oil. The portions are also a bit on the smaller side. Overall the food seems a little overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"Yummy comfort food. Great place to meet friends. Cute little place and the staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner here. It was quite busy on Friday night. The service was good.   I tried the surf and turf. It's pretty big on turf though so I would go for the catch pierogis if you want more seafood. The portion was large, did not really have any complaints I really enjoyed this comfort food. The crispy and steamed style perogies were not bad but I think I prefer the steamed. It was incredibly filling.  Also tried the sweet apple caramel pieorogi. So good. Really enjoyed the cheese pierogi that only comes with dessert. Wouldn't mind if they came with the mains. They give 5 cheese for dessert vs 8 potato for mains.  Was so stuffed after this meal. I would come back."}
{"text":"Kind of like a poutine -only with bland doughy pockets of potato instead of fries Nice servers/barkeeps but i'll stick to  boiling up & pan frying  the tasty  frozen pockets we get from eastern euro bakeries around town"}
{"text":"I have to stay away from this place or it'll end terribly for my health.  Just amazing, that's the only way I can describe it. All sorts of variations on the simple, humble, incredible pierogi.  The place is nice looking, friendly service, and it's not like you're waiting long for food either. They'll offer the choice of boiled or fried pierogi, boiled is probably more traditional, but fried gives you a great crunch. I didn't think to ask if half-and-half is possible but probably will next time.  They also have a huge selection of vodkas, a fitting finisher, and I hear that vodka negates some of the carbs in these heavy meals.  Huge fan. Love your work, guys."}
{"text":"Arrived here after a few beers, so I may have been a tad bit askew and a bit biased of the flavor of the food, but this place is delicious!  Went with a couple friends as we were looking to get a quick bite before going....to eat something. Okay, this was a bit redundant in some ways as we were eating two hours later, but the stomach wants but the stomach wants. I don't argue.  They give you two options when it comes to the pierogies: deep fried or boiled, or you can get them half and half. We tried both, and they were both good. Don't station yourself trying to decide. We had the Porky Pig, Butter Chicken and Wild Mushroom & Truffle kind. All of them mind-blowingly good. So good. And quick. We got the food in about 10 minutes.   Service was awesome. Our server had dreads...I can't remember his name but dude was super friendly and on point service wise. Gave us a fair assessment of how long food would take and suggestions for best varieties.   If you haven't been yet, go. Good prices, great food, service is great. It won't disappoint"}
{"text":"I've gotten takeout from Loaded Pierogi twice, both times the \"Kicking Kimchi\" option.  The first time around, I was a bit nervous . . . one would not think that Korean flavours would go well with pierogies, but they do!    I have to say, I'm surprised at the number of reviewers who seem to expect the pierogies to be \"filled\" with their \"topping\" selection.  I make pierogies from scratch at home on occasion, and I can say for certain that there is no way the Loaded Pierogi would be able to offer pierogies at the price points they do if they had to make individual batches for all of the \"flavours\" they offer.  Some people also comment on the value for money.  I work in the area, and $10+ for a similar amount and quality of food is quite common.  All in all, great option for the St. Lawrence Market area."}
{"text":"I love pierogis and this place hits the spot. Nice staff, I only come whenever I'm near by because it is pretty far for me. If you ever are near by and love pierogis give this a try! Like it's a must."}
{"text":"We were starving at 3pm on a Sunday so we dropped in to the relatively empty Loaded Pierogi. This place really revamps the typical pierogi, literally loading their dishes with tons of unorthodox ingredients. I ordered the 'Loaded Surf & Turf'. If you love seafood, you are bound to love their combination of pierogis, crab, and lobster. My SO got the 'Donald Duck', which was the special of the day and came with a $2 pint. Likewise delicious.  Service was great, and a reasonable price point for the amount of food on each dish (with the 15% Yelp discount of course). Will hopefully return in the future to try more items."}
{"text":"Met a small group of friends for brunch and did not know what to expect as I'm not a big pierogi aficionado but I was very pleasantly surprised.   They share a doorway with another restaurant hence the address 9 1/2 Church Street so it is a bit confusing as you walk in but once inside it is cosy and comfortable.  Cozy booths as well as comfortable stools at a larger table which accomadated our group very well. The service was friendly and quick and the variety of dishes w as very impressive. Once I realized the concept of loading pierogi with a variety of vegetables, meats, cheeses and sauces I was in! You can have your pierogi fried or boiled.   I chose fried and they were done to perfection.  Nice and crispy on the outside. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken for $12.50 and the flavors were incredible.   As mentioned there is a very wide variety of toppings from chicken, beef, lobster, crab and even duck.   There is even a dessert pierogi dish stuffed with sweet cheese with cinnamon spiced apples, sweet caramel sauce & whipped cream.  Maybe next visit!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place when visiting the city, and going in was the best decision I've made. It was nice and quiet and the service was amazing. And then there's the food which was unreal. I had my pierogis topped with pulled pork, bacon, chorizo sausage and cheddar cheese. At first it doesn't seem like a whole lot but you will be full afterwards, and it will be the best tasting pierogi meal you've had. 11/10 will be coming back when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Perogies may make it to my list of personal comfort foods, especially if it comes with great toppings. The perogies themselves are plain potato stuffed perogies, but it is the toppings which bring it to a whole new level. I got the the Cabbage Patch Kid ($11). The eight perogies are either boiled or fried (or you can go with half of each choice) and topped with crispy fried brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sun dried tomatoes, creamy ranch dressing, sour cream & green onions. The combination of toppings work well, especially with the crispy sprouts to give everything a bit of a crunch. Also, they are generous with the toppings, so there is more than enough to go with each bite.   Eight perogies don't seem like much, but they are very filling and can be on the heavy side. Definitely a complete meal versus a snack.  For a bigger meal, maybe choose one with more meat in the toppings. They have a different special each day where you can get a pint of Loaded Lager for $2 on top of the special dish price that day. A pretty good deal to round out all your comfort food needs."}
{"text":"I ordered dessert; and I was shocked to see Oreo crumble as a chocolate garnish. I liked Pierogi all six of them? Strawberry was masticated and not too sweet which made it perfect. Then I remembered that I have high expectations because I went to George Brown Chef school and this dish is under $10 for dessert."}
{"text":"I happened to be walking around in Toronto looking for something to eat when I ran into this place.  I'm already a fan of pierogi's so when I saw the name I had to go and check it out.  Lo and behold they specialized in pierogi's in which you can load it with extras if you would like.  The restaurant wasn't the largest place, but it had a nice atmosphere.  I sat at the bar and started to look at all the options on the menu.  The guys that worked there were great.  We talked about things to do and see while in Toronto and they were more than helpful with offering suggestions.  I started my meal with the Butter Chicken which had butter chicken sauce with slow roasted chicken breast, caramelized onions, habanero cheddar, sour cream & green onions and I also added chorizo.  I got half of them boiled and the other half fried.  Both were great but I think the fried were just a bit better in my opinion but that's just how I've always liked them the most.  This meal hit the spot, I ended up also getting the Baba's Classic to go.    I'll definitely be visiting again when I'm in area."}
{"text":"Deliciojs spot! This is the OG spot. Their duck confit and butter chicken pierogis were delicious and extremely filling. Will definitely leave room for th dessert ones next time!"}
{"text":"For a polish girl like me, this was an obvious stop while in Toronto. We ordered the buffalo chicken pierogis (from Buffalo, duh) and the red cabbage ones and I would give them a solid 4/5 stars, only because the portion was small-ish. Service was good, atmosphere ok, but if you're looking to try some polish food while in the city, I'd recommend a stop for a different, fun experience!"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant and the service was super too! I had the Porky Pig that was deep fried. You can get it boiled or 1/2 boiled and 1/2 deep fried. it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here for late lunch on Sunday. The place had plenty of seats, probably because it was around 2pm. Lots of light and friendly service.   I ordered the Donald Duck ($16) - half and half (half crispy and half boiled) perogies. The dish came with roasted duck leg and 8-10 perogies (not sure how many there were exactly as I did not count). There were plenty of other options too as well as daily specials (that included a pint of beer and perogies for approx $15) - we thought the specials was a good deal but we did not like the option of the day so we didn't get that.   The perogies were in good portion and very filling. A bit heavy must I say, but that is because of the nature of the perogies being very carb-heavy as well as the sauce.   Overall had a good experience here and I would come back!"}
{"text":"Cool place, after spending a nice weekend downtown wanted to check this place out because I'm polish and love my perogies.   It's an awesome spin on these traditional and simple dish. It's like having a Poutine with all your favourite toppings on it. Very creative and interesting .   Only thing missing in my opinion is the perogies themselves with only have cheddar Cheese in the inside which can get a bit boring, because in my opinion meat perogies on the inside are 10X better!!!  Bigger perogies and fresh homemade ones would make this place my favourite resto in the world but there always room for improvement !!!  I like this place a lot for a simple brunch in Toronto, Try it out"}
{"text":"Yes! I'm so happy this spot is close to home and not too expensive.   We had a Groupon which allowed us to order two entrees, two drinks (any drink under $10) and one dessert. Once we presented our Groupon, our waitress was still friendly and the fact that we were cheap (lol) did not affect her service for the night.   We ordered the the buffalo chicken, pork and sweet apple. You can either have them boiled or fried and I suggest the fried option.   We were served our drinks and our perogies shortly after. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BUFFALO CHICKEN. It was like eating wings and poutine at the same time. It had everything I wanted in a meal - saucy, sweet chicken bites, crispy potatoes like fries and creamy like mashed.   Our dessert was good too although I think the sweet cheese aka ricotta might be different for some people since my fianc√© didn't like it?  I don't know, he's weird.   There aren't a lot of places where I use a Groupon that warrants a second visit but I'll be back to try out other dishes and take advantage of their daily specials."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken and the dessert apple pierogi, both were crispy and both were delicious!  Buffalo chicken was a little spicy and despite the generous amount of sauces the pierogi's were still very crispy by the time they arrived at my place. They're filled with potato, so that's pretty average but the pieces of buffalo chickenare really good, crunchy on the outside soft on the inside and spicy! the green onions and cheese and the sourcream all add to a very tasty pierogi meal. Very comforting  The apple pierogis are filled with some sort of cheese? They went excellently with the caramel cinnamon apple dressing they were slathered with.   Good stuff"}
{"text":"Being of Eastern European background, I've tried a few pierogi's in my day. I may even call myself somewhat of an expert. I can confidently say that the ones I had here were delicious!   We tried the Wild Mushroom and the Cabbage Patch plates. The ranch on the latter was a bit much, but overall everything was well made and hit the spot! The mushroom was definitely the highlight of the meal and would be highly recommended. You can choose between either fried or boiled pierogi's. I preferred the boiled, as they were more traditional, but we decided to split each plate 50/50 between the two.  The meals are big here. With 8 pierogi's slathered in sauce and toppings, it fills you up nicely and keeps you warm in the winter!  If you're ever feeling like something homely with a modern twist, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Found this gem while on a trip to Toronto and introduced my two friends to Pierogi's. Great first experience for them and the daily special is a of the butter chicken with beer was fabulous."}
{"text":"Amazing experience! This place has a very fast turnover during the week so no need to make a reservation. Ordered the dark and stormy drink which was amazing. For dinner I opted for the cabbage patch kids dish, fried, and was not disappointed to say the least! Delicious deep fried Brussels sprouts and sun dried tomatoes, ranch sauce and sour cream, scallions and caramelized onions. What an explosion of delicious flavor! Boyfriend ordered the pulled pork and kielbasa dish, and loved it. We both left full, and we were going to try the dessert pierogies but sadly were too full to try them. Prices were very good. You get a lot of food that you can definitely eat most of (if not all), which is delicious and worth every penny. Would love to come back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday after work, lots of seats available around 6:30.  By the time we left it was pretty busy so...  Had the daily special; Smoking Pig Roast & Pint of Loaded Lager for $16.  Pretty good value for money.  Left full.  Our waiter was attentive, though my initial order got messed up.  Since it took extra time to get it right they gave me a discount which was nice.  My only problem was the perogies weren't quite as hot as I would have liked (maybe they rushed them out so I wouldn't have to wait?).  Aside from that, great flavour and portion sizes.  I'll definitely go back to try some of the other toppings!"}
{"text":"Perogies are amazing, and they have a great selection of beers and spirits.  The combinations are creative, but I like the Baba's Classic."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon and I think 99% of the couples there were also using their Groupon as it was expiring soon. The service was good, at times a bit slow, one of the servers was definitely nicer than the other.   We got two drinks, two loaded pierogies, and a dessert to share for our Groupon.  The drinks were tiny and looked like they came from an overpriced club in Toronto, they are listed as $9 and if I had to pay full price, I would have been very unhappy.  We both got the Roast Chicken and Avocado Club and for the most part, it is what you expect and pretty good BUT they served it with ROTTING avocado... I mean, it's part of the name, so you would think it would be edible. I just pushed it to the side and called it a day. It was also the special of the night...so you would think...they had better ingredients. Again, thankful I wasn't paying full price.   Lastly, we had the Apple Cinnamon pierogies which were surprisingly okay but the cheese inside the pierogi could have been creamier and smoothier, it had a weird texture to it.   Lastly, it's an okay place to dine at if you have a craving for loaded pierogies BUT without the Groupon, I would have been VERY dissatisfied."}
{"text":"The perogy themselves aren't very flavorful but sure I guess the toppings makes this tolerable. I had mushroom and truffle, and I also tried the catch and they were alright. The toppings are good but like I said the perogies themselves aren't flavorful (unlike say at European Delight).  However, I really liked the loaded lager from their tap. It is apparently by Wellington brewery but I can't find (thru research) 'loaded lager' beer by this brewery from the beer store. If anyone knows where to find this please message me! :D"}
{"text":"How can I explain the concept of Loaded Pierogi?  Basically, imagine you're making nachos, with a variety of different toppings, but instead of chips, you've got a pierogi base (fried, boiled, or half and half).  This is NOT what I was expecting, but I'm not complaining!  2 things I liked: Damn, that Miss Piggy is GOOD.  The sauce is delicious and the combo of the pork, goat cheese and green onion is *praise hands emoji*.  It was the deliciousness of this dish that caused me to beg my boyfriend to return.  The Butter Chicken wasn't AS good, in my opinion, but I still polished them all off in one go.  They serve Polish vodka!  I lived in Poland for 3 years and being able to order a Zurbuwka apple juice (and that the bar even had apple juice!) was the highlight of my visit.  1 thing I didn't: maybe the toppings are to be the focus, but the pierogi themselves aren't anything to write home about.  I've tried both the fried and the boiled, expecting the fried to just be a little bit crispier than the boiled, but they're not like fried pierogi I've had elsewhere at Polish places.    All in all, this place is tasty and well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I've grown up eating these and by far these are the best I've had since coming to Toronto. I had mined boiled and they were amazing. Caramelized onions truly made the dish of simple potato and cheese. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went to the Gerrard location with my sisters while visiting Toronto. It was early evening and the place was full of natural light. There were these golden hanging lightbulbs which gave fabulous ambience once the sun started to set. We started to realize that the \"get loaded\" tagline was actually referring to the fact that this was a place to drink. Vodka, in particular!  The menu is quite phenomenal. From Butter Chicken to dessert pierogies like Strawberry & Chocolate. There is something for everyone. I stuck to my seafood-loving roots and got The Catch, \"Atlantic lobster & crab with julienne sweet peppers, caramelized onions, hollandaise sauce, sour cream & green onions\". Damn! So delicious! And they were generous with both the hollandaise and the sour cream. Fabulous!  I got my pierogies half and half which meant half boiled and half deep fried. Both were fabulous. My sisters on the other hand got all deep fried.  Jamie ordered The Cabbage Patch Kid which came with crispy fried brussel sprouts, caramelized onions, cheddar cheese, sun dried tomatoes, creamy ranch dressing, sour cream & green onions. She LOVES brussel sprouts!  Shannon ordered The Porky Pig which came with crispy center cut bacon, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, sour cream & green onions.  Everything was delicious. Jamie's brussel sprout healthy goodness was cooked perfectly and Shannon's was cheese and bacon bliss.   The Loaded Pierogi on Gerrard has wonderful ambience so it is a great location for a family meal and if you want to add some vodka beverages to your cheese and potato dumplings, go for it! Service was lovely and the place always had people coming and going. It was quite packed when we left on my first Friday night in Toronto. What a perfect beginning to such an amazing trip home.  For complete review: http://www.suziethefoodie.com/the-loaded-pierogi/"}
{"text":"Soul food? I think not.  Anyway I ordered the buffalo chicken perogies, half fried half boiled. I thought the chicken was decent but the perogies weren't anythng special. They were the typical north american thick dough grocery store variety. The filling was a potato base...wasn't great tasting but wasn't bad. My fianc√©e ordered the Philly cheese steak half and half, and said that she encountered a lot of gristle in the little bit of beef she did get. Maybe I'm spoiled by the real perogies that her babcia makes, and if you've ever had real home made Polish perogies you'll know what I mean when you compare them to loaded perogies, but if you haven't you'll probably enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon to receive a drink, meal (under $15- which most options were) and dessert. When we arrived we had to wait maybe 10 minutes which was not a big deal. We were eventually seated but it took quite awhile to get served. All was forgotten once we received our meal. I have the 'BBQ Philly cheese steak' and my spouse had the ' bacon saverkraut & oh ya bacon' - both tasted great. No one checked to see how the meals was but maybe because we inhaled it. Would come back and recommend."}
{"text":"A very simple and well executed menu!  Potato and onion perogies, boiled or fried, with aptly named toppings.    Our order: Miss Piggy (fried) - apple smoked pulled pork; sweet bbq sauce The Catch (fried, would have been better boiled) - lobster and crab w hollandaise; real seafood Donald Duck (fried) - crispy duck confit; salty and savoury   We will definitely be back.  All the toppings were delicious and surpassed our expectations.  Filling portion sizes.  We have walked past this place a hundred times and never noticed it!  Right beside Hank's on Church, between Front and the Espanade."}
{"text":"comfort food and friendly service. They offered a variety of choice to go with perogies. From pull pork to butter chicken, almost anything you can think of, they are on the list.  The server will ask your preference and I took half and half both time I went, which means half fried and Half boiled. So if you are not a fan of boiled version, the healthier side, then go for the all fried.  The food are 3.8/5. Nice place to enjoy your comfort food but not something you want to wowed your date. If you up for a simple and casual meal, bingo! This is the place for you."}
{"text":"First time eating a Pierogi ever and it was amazing!  I had the BBQ Steak and my husband had the Miss Piggy & both tasted delicious. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Perogies... stuffed potato/cheese dumplings that were a staple while in school.  Buy a frozen pack, boil them, top with grated cheese... et voila!  European version of instant noodles!  Was in the downtown area and the wife wanted try this place out after seeing the food truck last week.  Its a small place, more like a pub/bar close to St. Lawrence Market.   In my head I thought \"loaded\" meant that each perogie would be filled with different fillings inside the perogie, but instead realized the \"loaded\" meant toppings on top instead.  The perogies are all the same and you can choose whether you want them boiled or lightly fried.  The toppings go on top which consists of about 8 perogies per order and costs about $8-17.  The perogies were well done and each tasty.  Portions though were on the small size but relatively filling.  But if you were a big eater like me you will be left wanting.  Its a good experience to try but not sure I would come back soon as this might be better as a food truck experience as the price point is high for what you get."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with 3 coworkers.    Atmosphere:  A cozy place that can seat around 30 people all together.  I would not go there in groups larger than 10.    Food: (5 stars) With 8 pierogis for each order, I thought I was going to be still hungry at the end.  However I was pleasantly surprised to be full at the end of the meal. I got The Bacon, sauerkraut and 'oh yeah' bacon (see picture) with all the pierogis being boiled.  (You can choose between fried, boiled or half/half).  I ate all the pierogis and still had two full spoons of bacon left, they are very generous with the protein.  Next time I go, I would likely get just one add on.   The total with tax and tip came to $16   Service: (5 stars) The waiter was nice and attentive, kept refilling our glasses with water but was not interrupting out conversations.   I would recommend this place for lunch in small to medium sided groups."}
{"text":"This place was so good! The service was quick and efficient and everyone loved their meals. The peirogies are perfect and so are the toppings. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Downtown Toronto. We were in town for a conference and I was looking for something different - and we found it!  There were so many different flavor a of pierogis - it was so hard to decide which ones to get. Each order is 8 pieces, and you can choose boiled or fried, or do half and half.   There were 5 of us so we got 5 different kinds - the cabbage patch, the porky pig, the surf and turf, chicken club and one more.   They were all fantastic - each better than the next. If I had to pick a favorite - it would either be the porky pig or cabbage patch kid.   Personally I thought boiled was just as good as friend.   The service was great - attentive, quick, and good. They also had a nice selection of beer and liquor drinks.   Definitely a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Definitely nothing special, the pricing is OK I did order in so maybe that did affect the taste as they almost tasted like they were store-bought rather than homemade,  If I were to buy pierogies again I would just stick to authentic shops on Ronsy\"a ... I don't think I would order this place again"}
{"text":"We thought we'd died and gone to pierogi heaven. $8 Canadian bought us a plate of fantastic pierogi--we got 2 varieties and shared, and this was a filling, unique meal. They start with the basic pierogi (dough filled with a potato-onion batter and folded over and sealed) and then either boil (traditional way) or fry to perfection. You can stop there with the basics, topped with sour cream, or you can get all kinds of add-on toppings, from bacon and cheese to kimchi. The bar selection is also good--try a fun, unique vodka to accompany your meal. The music was very loud (on a day when almost no one was there), but we were wallowing in the joy of pierogi, so who cares. Would go back eagerly to try a different variety!"}
{"text":"One word to summarize my experience here - disappointed. The name is extremely misleading as it makes me think that each pierogi is loaded with the ingredients of the flavour we chose.   Came here as a group, there were 6 of us. Our server said that sharing 4-5 plates would be enough. Some of us weren't too hungry, so we ordered 4 different flavours.  Food didnt take long to arrive, and they all arrived together in a window of about 3 minutes. Super disappointed when we all realized the flavours are actually just toppings, and the actual pierogis were the same.  We finished all 4 plates of pierogis, and we were nowhere close to being full. We didn't want to wait for more to come, plus I felt slightly scammed. So we went to get gelatos instead.   On the other hand, the pierogis with toppings were fine. Nothing that wowed me, but once advice, name change to Topped Pierogis?"}
{"text":"The food & selection (4/5): They offer a wide variety of choices, ranging from meat to seafood. The portions are perfect too. You can also choose to do all boiled, deep fried or half/half for your perogies. However, there is only one vegetarian option and two dessert choices. Also don't have a high expection of their alcoholic drinks.       -Smoking Pig Roast  (half/half): A little too salty, esp the chorizo. I like the deep fried perogies over the boiled ones.  -BBQ Philly Cheese Steak (deep fried): The beef was very tendered and cheese wasn't overpowering. It's a good combination with the deep fried perogies. -Strawberry and Chocolate (dessert): The sweet perogies are deep fried, wrapped with ricotta cheese. Not overly sweet but quite heavy after eating just one or two (esp after the savory dish). Very interesting flavors, but not a big fan of sweet perogies I'd say (I always claimed there's no dessert I don't like, but this might be the first; but then again it's just personal preference).   Cost (4/5): Got a Groupon deal which I ended up paying only $27 plus tax and tips (which added up to around $15) for dinner for two, including two pierogie dishes, 2 alcoholic drinks under $10 and a dessert to share..however, without the Groupon,  you would expect to pay $70 + tax for what I got.  Service (3.5/5): Staffs were quite attentive. Food took longer to come than expected, but it was okay as we weren't in a rush. For one of the drinks we got though, they took it away right before we even tried it, since they said they made a mistake / forgot to lemon juice in it and had to remake it.   Ambience (4/5): They put their menu on a massive chalkboard and the rest of the decor is nice and simple which makes the restaurant pretty neat and comfortable. They also have nice and roomy booths for 2 (up to 4) people so it was a great place to eat in."}
{"text":"The pierogi's were great and reasonably priced. The reminded me of the ones that I would eat as a kid but with a new twist. Leave room for the desert pierogi's. You'll be happy that you did."}
{"text":"I should've looked at pictures. Loaded pierogi means that the pierogis are the same, except the toppings are different...rather than they are stuffed with the ingredients they mentioned.   The food was decent, but nothing spectacular. Just a good hearty plate of food, something I would particularly enjoy after a night out. The plate looks fairly small, but its heavy. You'll realize why quickly after finishing it."}
{"text":"Porky pig (fried) - tastes good but bacon is salty and ask for bacon well done if you like it crispy because they come soggy   Wild mushroom and truffle oil (boiled) - tastes really good but I'm biased because I love mushrooms and this came with plenty of mushrooms,  wished there were more mushrooms   $5 pint of loaded lager - it's a light beer but can't go wrong   Atmosphere: nice, comfy place, we came on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't busy. Entrance is a bit tricky to find; Look for Hanks and choose the door on the left.   My husband and I will most likely come back again."}
{"text":"Came here with a buddy thinking it would be a snack - needless to say we left stuffed. Although the menu does seem a bit overpriced considering it's perogies but what you get definitely feels like a meal. The service was great and we had our order within about 10 minutes or so. Also our perogies originally came out a bit cold in the centre so the server quickly replaced it with a new one without any hesitation."}
{"text":"I tried this place two times. Both times I had great food. I like their main dishes and desserts too. They have a sweet cottage cheese dessert which is very Eastern European. I tried Pierogi in Poland before and my problem was with the main dish is the lack of sour cream. I felt the sour cream was not enough compare to the amount of food I got. Other than that, it's great!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp before I visited Toronto, and was happy to see a pierogi place! I'm Russian and these pierogis are top notch. They have your traditional kinds and non-traditional kinds. I couldn't pass up the one with the duck leg! It was delicious and was so full but couldn't stop eating. They offer boiled or fried, or half and half! I chose half and half, of course. Cocktails are great too!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting and it was everything you'd expect it to be. Kind service in a great location. The menu us somewhat small but lots of great choices. The servers are attentive and happy to recommend dishes to you. My sister had one of the top sellers and I had the classic. Both dishes were great and surprisingly didn't leave us in food comas haha! The dishes also were overly greasy which was awesome. You'll also get a choice or fried or boiled which is great to address all preferences.   My only suggestions are to add some more dessert options that are not pierogi inspired just because that's a super hefty meal! Also some appetizers would be great  and for the kiddies, some half sizes are pint size meals would help. Maybe even a \"build your own\"....i expect credit if this is ever implemented...ypu heard it here first!  Great experience overall and is be back."}
{"text":"I've never had pierogi so it was interesting to try! I got the butter chicken topping with half deep fried and half boiled pierogis.   The order came with 8 pcs, which wasn't really filling for me. I was expecting to have more sauce from the butter chicken as it was kind of dry.  The service was awesome! The waitress came over to check up on us and constantly filled our water."}
{"text":"My son and I ate a very late lunch at Loaded Pierogi on 7/3/16 after walking around Toronto Islands -- we had taken the ferry back and were looking for a place that was open in mid-afternoon on a Sunday. We discovered Loaded Pierogi on a side street east of Toronto's central business district and were one of the few customers there. We had mushroom pierogi (me) and onion pierogi (my son), and sampled their beers on tap. It was all delicious. Go there for the food, and the drinks are worth it.   The place itself is fairly dark -- not much lighting, and dark wood paneling/black slate (sorry -- chalkboard, not stone) in the bar area. One of the more interesting parts of the dining experience was the server. I swear she was the most dour, unhappy server I'd seen in Toronto. She was perfectly professional, but obviously not happy to be there when it was a gorgeous day and there was no way our tipping could make up for the slow numbers. Fairly realistic attitude, I'd say, and as I wrote above, perfectly professional."}
{"text":"The first time I heard about this concept - pierogi poutine - I knew I would love it. So I was eager for Loaded Pierogi to open its doors. I finally made it over there last month, but I did not dine in. Two friends and I ordered our poutines to go (we all chose to have them fried - you can also choose boiled), and we ate them in the car on our way to a party. I had the the Buffalo Chicken for $12.50, one friend had Baba's Classic for $7.50 and the other had Miss Piggy for $11. The prices for the poutines range from $6.50 to $15. My friends and I really enjoyed the poutines - good portion, fresh ingredients, everything was made to order, and the combination options were great.   For my second visit, I wanted to go with a few friends, and knowing that their seating is limited, I contacted the restaurant to inquire about a good time to visit with a large group. The restaurant simply stated, \"let us know when you are coming, and we will do our best to accommodate you.\" After reviewing their schedule, I decided to pay them a visit on a Saturday at 11:30am with about 11 friends. They open at 11:30am, so I figured that dining at this time could guarantee us seating (be the first ones through the door), and in fact, the restaurant did not start to fill up until after 12:30pm.   I gotta say, I was relieved when every single one of my friends loved their poutine, and the concept! In fact, several of them could not wait to return. The poutine that seemed to get the most positive reviews was the Western for $11 (fried sunny side egg, with saut√©ed peppers, smoked ham, Swiss cheese, hollandaise sauce & green onions). And it was also a good idea to meet on a Saturday because the St. Lawrence Market is just around the corner for some shopping later!   Sure, some people have commented on the prices, and some feel that there is no value for money here. However, I think the prices are quite reasonable, specially if you stick to the more standard options like bacon and sour cream. And even the basic options are not so basic since they do throw in the caramelized onions, though personally I could care less about that since I hate onions. They were kind enough to put them on the side for me (on a small plate), and then I passed this plate down the table, and people were thrilled to add it to their poutine. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday lunch and it was lovely. Delicious food (we preferred the boiled perogies over the fried), cozy atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Visiting from Alberta, pierogi's are a big thing. Grocery stores are filled with a multitude of pierogis, Ukrainian churches often have pierogi nights, and most weekend markets have stalls that are selling freshly made pierogis. I was hesitant to eat here because I knew it would be difficult to gauge the target audience and it would be difficult to not compare my experience to local cuisine. So, with that caveat, I hope I am honest and fair with my review.  The decor is nice. The tables and chairs are pretty standard fare and there is a bar with 4 or 5 stools. There's a lot of wood and brick and interesting simulated gas lamps over the bar and  many of the tables. We came at night and the lamps provide very warm lighting, so the space was dim and very cozy.  Service was good. We came in 10 minutes before they closed and they happily served us and even took in stride the annoying questions from my mate about getting a hamburger. The food came quick (maybe too quick) and we were in and out within fifteen minutes. I also noticed that in the short time we were there, they had 3 pickup orders.  Their beer list was short with 6 or 7 options, but all were local craft beers, which always pleases me. If we had more time, perhaps we would have stayed for a few.  The menu has 16 different pierogi offerings; Baba's Classic which is pierogies with caramelized and green onions, cheddar and sour cream. The other offerings take that basic pierogi and 'load' it with a diverse list of ingredients. truffle, mushroom, duck, lobster, crab, bacon, butter chicken, and so on. If you're looking for a pierogi 'experience', then you can get it here. Prices range from the Baba's Classic ($8) up to $16. We had the classic and the Smoking Pig Roast (BBQ pulled pork, bacon, and chorizo). Sadly, this is where it all fell apart for me. The pierogies were decent but quite salty, and the pulled pork, bacon, and chorizo were all hugely salty and as a result, almost inedible.  Sadly, I wish my experience was better. The menu looks quite intriguing and the beer is good enough for me to want to hang out and nibble at a few different types. Baba's for $8, would be great if the pierogies were great. Smoking Pig Roast for $14 felt like highway robbery. Sorry, Loaded Pierogi, I can't see returning to give this another try."}
{"text":"Unexpected cozy hangout spot with booth seating available and warm lighting.  As for the pierogis, you have the option to get half and half of boiled and fried. I got half and half for both my orders, but ultimately preferred the boiled. The fried ones weren't as crispy as I thought it would be and I liked the soft skin paired with the potato filling instead.   I tried The Catch and the Bacon & Sauerkraut Pierogi was. The bacon & sauerkraut had much more flavour as I thought the salty bacon and the pickled sauerkraut went well with the pierogi which are mild in flavour themselves.  Checking into Yelp also gets you 15% off your entire meal!"}
{"text":"I had came here with a friend for a quick lunch. I ordered the buffalo chicken and he had ordered the mushroom truffle.   Buffalo Chicken - The pierogis themselves were not bad. The sauce on the buffalo chicken was a bit heavy and salty. Even eating it with the potatoes, I felt it was overwhelming at times.   Mushroom truffle - I had asked my friend how he enjoyed his dish. It was basically the exact opposite of my experience. He thought the mushroom truffle was quite bland and the sauce was too light. He thought it was quite average to say the least.   To be completely honest, I probably would not come back again as there are definitely better choices around the area."}
{"text":"Loaded Pierogie sounded like it would be a restaurant that stuffed pierogies with interesting flavors, but what you actually get is a plate loaded with interesting flavors. It is not bad and there was no one there when we went, but the name is little misleading. Maybe change the name to Loaded Plates and Pierogies?"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday late lunch. My bf and I were the only people in this restaurant during the time.  The restaurant was very clean and bright. Our server was very prompt and friendly.  I got the smoking pig roast ($14) which includes bbq pulled pork, bacon bits, sausage,chorizo, and sour cream  I opt for half boiled and half fried  I really loved it! I like the fried pirogies better than the boil. I like the combination of all the meats. I would totally order this next time!   My bf got the buffalo chicken ($12.50) breaded crispy chicken tossed in buffalo sauce with cheddar cheese, green onion, sour cream, and buttermilk ranch dressing  The buffalo sauce wasn't overpowering and it had a really nice crunch to the chicken. Overall it was really good.   This location has side parking but I just park underground parking of Gerrard Square mall, just a block away from the restaurant.   Overall, if I was in the area I would def come back; the service was really fast and the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"amazing perogies! went here for take outs. we got the mushroom perogies and the sauerkraut bacon perogies. both were good but i preferred the mushrooml. heaps of toppings, and really warm perogies. i also got a side of pulled pork which was mediocre"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Loaded Pierogi when I first heard about it. I love pierogies and I don't get to eat them very often. My boyfriend and I went to the new restaurant about a week or so after it opened.  Loaded Pierogi is a decent size restaurant located right beside the cafe called Hank's (both establishments are by the same owners). There are many ways to have your pierogies. Some of the exciting dishes are The Donald Duck (you get an entire confit duck leg!), The Caramel Apple (more savoury), and more. I ordered Ms. Piggy because I thought it was a suitable choice for myself by title. However, I was a wee disappointed when I realized it was plainer than my boyfriend's Porky Pig since mine costed more. I enjoyed my meal nonetheless. I do think Porky Pig tastes better because of the bacon and cheddar cheese.  You can order a vodka flight ($12) here, something I don't see very often because beer flights are more popular. You get three 1 oz. drink from their bronze, silver and gold menu each. They have other alcoholic beverages, including signature cocktails.  Loaded Pierogi is great for some comfort food and for any pierogi fan. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying something else in the future."}
{"text":"The pierogis are not stuffed with the mentioned ingredients, they are plain potato and topped with whatever you order. They are either deep fried or boiled... Boil them, then fry them, in a pan with onions or something. The deep fried ones had no flavour at all. I feel so bad saying this, but if you think these are good, I don't think you've had real, homemade pierogis. :( very, very disappointed. Ugh."}
{"text":"I actually wanted to give this establishment a 2.5. Really not sure what the hype was all about, my fianc√© is Russian so we were super excited to check this place out in hopes of getting some super fancy pirogies outside of the traditional East European pirogies.    The decor was welcoming when we came in. The hostess did not greet us when we walked in, a cook from the kitchen just told us to grab a seat any where we wanted.  We came in hungry and the menu looked really appealing to us. the waitress told us right off the bat that the flavors or type of protein/veggies we choose will just be a topping on top of their basic potato pirogies. You can either choose the pirogies to be deep fried or steamed. We went with the traditional steam style. We were still Super excited about my 16$ duck confeit pirogies despite the fact that the duck meat would not be incorporated in the filling... So our meals came... and the presentation of our dishes were really disappointing. Imagine a basic poutine with a nasty gravy mix ... my green onions were so nonchalantly chopped... there was one big piece that was obviously chopped 3 times but failed to be separated. I understand this might just be a typical street food and I shouldn't have too high of an expectation but if you are going to use \"duck confeit\" - a traditional French dish as a gimmick... I, as a customer will appreciate a better presentation of the dish. However, the Duck leg was cooked fine, nothing special. The pirogies were fine, just some big giant mashed potato wrapped in a dough.   My fianc√©e ordered the BBQ philly cheese steak and the meat was tough.. again, presentation was poor and the sauce was nothing special.  I wouldn't come back to this place but if you want something super hearty and filling and you are too lazy to make your own mashed potatoes with your choice of protein, perhaps you should give it a try!  Overall: 2.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Value: 3/5 Food: 2/5 Presentation: 1/5 Service: 2/5"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday and it was fairly quiet compared to its brunching neighbour Hank's. Luckily we were in the mood for comfort food with pierogis. We couldn't decide which to get and ordered three to share adventurously! We did the Oh Yeah Bacon boiled, the Buffalo chicken fried and the Truffle Mushroom fried. All were excellent although we finished the Buffalo chicken and had to take a couple of all the rest home :) big recommend. We can't wait to come back and try more flavours. Butter chicken and philly cheese steak next!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food.  We had Baba's classic and the Buffalo chicken.  They were wonderful.  Good selection of beer and vodkas"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem. Very friendly waitress who was extremely helpful. The food was delicious. So many things to choose from. The restaurant is small and comfortable. I will definitely eat here again and again when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"If you're on Queen West - eat here!  It's a quaint little restaurant that serves some of the best Pierogi dishes I've had! They offer both fried and baked, and it comes with 8 Pierogi's.  Trust me - it is more than enough! It's topped wit some pretty fantastic flavours and meats (try anything that has the pulled pork- it's so good).  The service is also really, really great.  Very low key kind of restaurant.  There isn't a lot of space for seating so I would not recommend doing a party here.  Drinks there aren't the greatest, but who's going for a drink when there's PIEROGIS!"}
{"text":"Outstanding....! Truly unique!   Excellent!   Went with a groupon, didn't know exactly what to expect.   Service, food, atmosphere, all a 10!  I had the truffle mushroom pierogies,  loaded with goat cheese,  mushrooms,  etc.   Awesome.   Friend had the confit duck, also excellent!   Staweberry chocolate sauce dessert Pierogies were outstanding.   Servers were fantastic, staff in general terrific!   Will definitely be back!   PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION IN SOUTH ETOBICOKE SOON!  Huge eastern European community, more space, cheaper rent,  etc..... Please?  How about on the Queensway?"}
{"text":"Totally forgot to take pictures! BUT nonetheless this place was super good! We stumbled in here by accident, as the person I was with is in love with pierogis and almost bolted here as soon as he saw the sign. The chef was really nice, and asked us how it was after we had finished, which I thought was a really nice touch. We got the two vegetarian ones (the Baba's Classic and The Cabbage Patch Kid) which were both good, but I personally preferred the Baba's Classic as I'm not the biggest Brussel Sprouts fan. My only issue was that I wish there were more vegetarian options, or at least the option to remove some of the meat toppings off of the other menu items, as those are the only two vegetarian things on the menu. Also - they serve some canned alcohol!"}
{"text":"Great value, great friends, great funnn. Love the decor on the walls and EDM was sublime"}
{"text":"Pierogi's were delicious. The service was outstanding- will be returning on my next cheat date :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this restaurant has a food truck, but they should.  Their concept is simple, delicious, inventive and completely New Canadian.   Their restaurant is small but their menu is endless and I wish I could have ordered one of everything.    My husband got the buffalo chicken and I got the miss piggy (because any sweet/savory combo is a no brainer for me).   Each flavor was distinct and the pierogis were cooked to perfection.  We were even able to get a small side order plain for the kiddo and he loved them.  The restaurant fills up quick and I recommend If you have a little one going earlier rather than later since it has a hipper bar vibe at night.  Totally happy I found this gem and definitely worth the walk from our hotel!"}
{"text":"I had a super quick meal at Loaded Pierogi, but it was great! I got the mushroom/goat cheese topping with the half fried/half boiled pierogies. I knocked one star off because a few of the pierogies were very undercooked and doughy. But overall tasty!"}
{"text":"This is something you try. It's poutine on top of pierogies. My Polish grandmother would just die if she saw truffles perched on top of her pierogy but obviously Toronto is ready for it. I went with an open mind, my 22 year old daughter loves this place. I am glad I went but I won't make it a regular. I feel $16 and up is a little steep for what I received. Also, I may be just spoiled because I like my traditional pierogy stuffed with yummy things and served with fried onions and a side of sour cream. So for my Polish fix I will continue to go to the west end but if you are looking for a new twist on poutine because your tired of fries give this place a try."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell if it came out of a bag or not but the pierogi didn't stand out. The toppings was great, the duck confit was quite tasty but i didn't feel like it was anything overly special.   Come if you must but you're not missing much if you don't."}
{"text":"Usually I take my pierogis with a side of old lady at a deli counter on Roncy, but I believe in all carb pockets, so I won't discriminate.   I got stuffed at Loaded Pieorgi yesterday for lunch, and it was sour cream-y deliciousness. I got the classic, half fried and half boiled. Surprisingly, I prefer the boiled, but everything on my plate was caramelized, cheesy goodness. They appear to have a full bar, so think I might return soon for dinner."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I had never gone to Loaded Pierogi because I can make the fried up frozen variety at home easily. But they lured me in with a sandwich board speaking of $2 pint. So if I order the daily special I get a pint of their house lager for $2. Okay. Not mad about this.   Today's special was the smoking pig roast which features some pulled pork, spicy chorizo, green onions, sour cream and overall yumminess. Okay. Done. I'm trying this. Oh and if you check in on Yelp, you get 15% off your first order. Even more enticed to explore and try!   You have the option of boiled or fried pierogis. I got half and half. But I recommend fried because it'll stay better together underneath all the toppings loaded on! (see what I did there?) Boiled is obviously healthier but sometimes you have to live and eat the fried variety.   The quality of ingredients were fresh & tasty. Presentation was Instagram worthy. The service was great considering it was just one guy solo serving the restaurant and takeout orders. The lager was the standard house lager but their regular tap list was featuring some standard Ontario choices over generic brands. I'd go again if I wanted some pierogi comfort food and I was in the neighbourhood. Definitely an upgrade to my own frozen pierogi alternative. Also I almost forgot that it used to be a coffeetime. Nice renos!"}
{"text":"I would absolutely recommend this place to and pierogi lover out there. The place is a small little thing but their menu certainly packs a punch. You get the option of having your pierogoes boiled or fried (I got mine fried of course) and then all the fixings on top. Very very good, im eastern European I know a good pierogi when i see one. They do also have a sweet pierogi on the menu which I absolutely have to go back and try!  One last thing, the restaurant shares a bathroom with the place next door. The bathrooms were really clean, and well stocked."}
{"text":"\"meh, I've experienced better\" on so many levels.  the first time that I came here and the last time that I came here were night and day experiences.  this is why I'm never coming back.  came here for our fourth year anniversary, came in and waited to be served, when the lady came over to greet us, she told us we could sit anywhere, when I picked out a spot, she told me we couldn't sit there because a birthday party was coming in for that section. strike one.  so I asked her if she had another option which was better suited, so we were sat down and on our way. it took an irresponsible amount of time to get our drink order, and later on our food order.  fast forward to the food coming and two of the plates had visible chips in them, I didn't feel the need to bring it up as their seemed to be only one lady holding down the whole front of the restaurant, after our food did arrive, she immediately started to run around collecting all of the cash for the day and put it into a safe for the day, next thing I know and through the middle of the meal...she's putting her coat on and leaving for the day... strike two  after she left another lady emerged and was taking over for her with the whole front area, it took about 20 minutes from the time we were done, until the plates were picked up and taken away.  strike three.  at this point we ordered dessert and much to my surprise, another chipped plate.  strike four.  the new server was super nice when she wasn't busy with the party. the food was very fresh and flavorful, I would stay away from the dessert though as it was a bit over sloppy for me personally.  I won't be back to this location, as it is clearly not worth my time, energy and hard earned money.  if you think that comment is harsh...please ask yourself.  would you want to go to a restaurant that your server just up and leaves you half way through the meal and not say bye? unprofessional at the highest level.  parking is available on the side streets and with some side lots.  transit options are the 501 queen and the 511 Bathurst with a bit of walking."}
{"text":"I'm not 100% sure what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. It was good, you should go and try it. Maybe you'll get what you're expecting, with lots of sour cream. Definitely don't get extra, there was a lot. But maybe get extra cheese, because you can't go wrong with extra cheese. Price was reasonable, food was tasty, people were nice, all around good place, go try it."}
{"text":"Located near the Kensington Market in Toronto, and a short walk from Union Station, the Loaded Pierogi is a cute restaurant that serves.. you guessed it - pierogies, pireogies, and more pierogies!  They have great weekly specials that include a drink with an order of pierogies, and lots of unique toppings/flavours.   I had the butter chicken and it wasn't a traditional butter chicken in any sense, but had grilled chicken and some nice spices on top of the pierogies.  You can ask to have your pierogies boiled or fried, I preferred boiled, as the fried tasted kind of like pizza pops.     The service was fine, but we were the only ones in the restaurant, so it was hard to gauge what it is like when busy.   Overall, it was a tasty stop in Toronto, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. Exciting flavors. We did the half fried- half boiled. Service was great too. We chose the Donald Duck and the bacon sauerkraut. The duck was cooked to perfection and loved the crispness of the bacon. All 16 pieces of pierogi was devoured. Will try to leave space for dessert pierogies next time."}
