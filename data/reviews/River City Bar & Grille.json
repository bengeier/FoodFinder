{"text":"I can only give them four stars because they won't reserve me a stool on Friday night.  No one can insult you better than Susie or Fuzz.  Good food and a great drink."}
{"text":"Great wings, great onion rings.  Fun and party like atmosphere.  Long island ice tea was \"perfect\"  excellent oakies.  Can't  think of a reason not to return, and can't  wait to try other burgers on the menu."}
{"text":"Today during the Browns game we ordered grilled chicken salad and wings , \" carry out\"  this place used to have the best wings and chicken salad. What happened ? We called ahead to place our order and we even said please make the wings fresh do not want reheated . We have had two previous dried out wing experiences . This was the last straw not ever ordering there again . Dried out wings and two maybe three mushrooms and barely any bacon in our large grilled chicken salad . Bad bad bad food . No point in calling them already said something when we were there last time . They can't hear I guess . Save your money just go and drink I guess"}
{"text":"The four must be understood in the context of this being a bar with food.  River City has a very loyal local following, including people with the kind of money they could go anywhere. So why?  Friendly place.  Very good hamburgers for a great price.  On Fridays, decent fish fries.  Very good fries, although under cooked on most recent visit.   Lots of beers, but only a few on tap.  As indicated, parking can get tricky."}
{"text":"Great selection of delicious homemade soup daily. Friendly atmospheres, great place to go for a beer and some comfort food."}
{"text":"Dear Los Angeles, if you're ever looking for the perfect setting for the next great Ohio based sitcom, pick this place.   1) You'll have a Cheers like atmosphere full of fun and friendly people. 2) You get to eat Crab Fritters and Fried Pickles 3) Seriously, the decor is spot on sitcom bar awesome 4) It's not noisy  Can't wait to go back - and it's right by my brother's house so I know we will!"}
{"text":"Nice, local restaurant/bar.  Parking can get tricky.    I have always found this place to be clean and offer good service.  The menu is what you would expect and the food quality has always been consistent.  They have $.60 Oakies on Monday- had to ask what those were!  Reubens are pretty good.    I think this is an OK place for families as long as it isn't after 8 or so."}
{"text":"Many good experiences here at this nice inexpensive seat-yourself restaurant.  We've eaten at all the local restaurants, high and low end.   This is the best of the cheaper restaurants in this area.  Good burger and very good fries, nice grilled chicken salad etc.  Big menu of solid fare.   Only complaint is that the beer taps are very limited - Miller, Budweiser and I think one other that rotates.  A good selection of bottles, though.   Parking can be an issue and the joint is usually crowded.  But that's how popular places are."}
{"text":"Great local place for food & drinks! Lots of specials throughout the week including food & drink specials, Bloody Mary's & breakfast are great!"}
{"text":"Great local bar. Awesome service( Susie) every Thursday night after golf. Great atmosphere simple and easy cheap comfort food. Grilled chicken salad is awesome and Thursday night special is huge cheeseburger. If your looking for something simple easy and friendly service with great food stop on in great time"}
{"text":"Everyone knows that if you can find a local \"Dive Bar\" then you will find the best food. If you're in Cuyahoga Falls, or passing through on Rt. 8, this is the place! The food is awesome, the staff is friendly and the prices are low. Family friendly so take your kids too.   Everything on the menu is really good, almost all homemade and they have great daily specials. My families favorites are the Swiss Steak Dinner on Wednesday's and the 8 oz. Steak Dinner on Saturday's.   Do you like soup's? River City has the best!! Every day there are at least 5 or more to choose from and they are all homemade. Pair that with a couple of their oakies and you won't be disappointed.  I have to add, since it is a bar too, grab some friends and head over for game night! They have the BEST drinks and appetizers to make it a fun evening. Try their Martini's! Yummm"}
{"text":"I would say maybe 2.5 and that might be pretty generous. I'm not exactly sure why this place such high reviews? It's a local bar, and you can tell it's mostly locals that go here. So here's the breakdown...  I had some boneless wings and a side salad. The wings were probably the smallest ones I have ever seen, but they weren't awful. They had good flavor, but for being spicy garlic I didn't taste much spice or garlic. The side salad was normal for bar I guess, not terrible but it was kids lettuce mostly. My husband had what they call oakies which are pretty much just sliders. They were $.60 a piece. So even if they were terrible, which they weren't, you can't beat that price. They were over cooked a little but still, not bad. The order of fries he ordered were probably frozen first, but he got a good amount of them. My mother in law got a blt wrap with ham on it. She didn't say it was bad, but she did say she could make it at home.   The service wasn't bad, even tho it seemed like there was only one guy that was running all the tables and the bar. When there's only about 3 tables and a half a dozen people at the bar I guess it's not that hard. So you see, going in I didn't expect much and I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed. It is also somewhere I wouldn't go back to if I had the choice."}
{"text":"Best townie bar in town. The bartenders (one of whom is my ex-boyfriend/good friend, so I may be biased) are spot-on & good at what they do. Free pretzel sticks at the bar. Recent forays into Saturday night karaoke. Impromptu high school reunions when you realize you know everyone at the bar. Dartboard in the corner. Jukebox with everything on it. Greasy, delicious bar food. Obviously, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Food is excellent for how cheap you pay for it! Especially the wings ... (Wednesday Wing Night). Very local bar feel with a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing how my previous review is no longer on their Facebook page. Service is sub par unless you're one of the \"Click\"   I sat and waited for them to take  my order for over 10 minutes after I had time to review the \"bar\" menu. The food was good, gotta love Kirbie's Meat for their burgers. There were 3 servers there in the late afternoon and the bar was 60% filled. I observed the severs talking with the \"regulars\" while myself and others were waiting to place their orders. My wife and I used to stop in there once a week, sometimes twice and the service was so much better, however that was 4 years ago I won't be going back"}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hometown bar. There are specials every day of the week. Nothing on the menu is over priced. The best thing...the food is GOOD! They don't have computers so it takes more time than a chain...but everyone here works hard to give you good service. This is a fantastic place to grab a bit to eat and have a drink. If it's your first time...make sure to get some oakies!"}
{"text":"We love Monday Oakies night it's our fave. The staff is always so friendly. We usually run into someone we know while enjoying our burgers, fries and a cold beer! Great family friendly place!"}
{"text":"I tried to order wings from this place and I can't eat the drumsticks so I asked for 12 flats (flat wings) and they refused to do it. I explained I cannot eat the drumstick and they replied oh well..... I will never order anything from here. On a side note I highly recommend alterie's pizza and chicken wings. The quality and flavor are top notch and they are very accommodating."}
{"text":"You couldn't ask for slower service. I'd say I have average patience, but this place leaves me ready to rip my hair out every time I go. The food is okay, but if you go... sip your drinks slowly, it may be awhile before someone even looks in your direction to see if you need a refill."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Tonight hand cut steaks.for $8,99 on Saturday night. Everyone loved it that ordered the special.  My husband loved his burger. Wings were excellent. Onion rings were homemade. This neighborhood place is special. I wish we still lived  here. We would be regulars."}
{"text":"Comfy neighborhood bar.  Lots of regulars.  Simple, but good bar food. Nice daily specials as well. Try the Oakies! Bartenders are always friendly.  Wish the draft beer options were better, but the beer list is nice overall.  They usually have karaoke the last Saturday of the month. Always draws a crowd."}
