{"text":"2nd stop - Adam's Ribs - owned by the guy that owns The Freakin' Frog ( not a surprise when you see the beer selections at Adam's  ) 

Nice looking restaurant ( better than Rib Shak ), don't care for the location ( not easy to get to from the 215  - it looks like it should be easy to pull into )

Ordered the regular spareribs with one side ( coles slaw ) -  $7
frilled ribs - yes; BBQ - i don't think so ( assuming you use the low/slow definition )  meat quality was decent, but i wish they would've cut up the 1/4 rack - it was messy !  dang it BK - i disagree with you on the slaw - way too much carrot and little seasoning.

again, i think it's worth a 2nd visit, especially to sit down and have a few beers with some  'Q !"}
{"text":"This was the last place I ate at in my last trip to Vegas. 

When Roo and Eimi brought us here, I wasn't expecting alot. All they told me was that it was claimed \"Best Ribs\" of Las Vegas, but I never believe sayings like that....until now. 

I had the sweet tea, which was really good. One of the best sweet tea's that I've had since my last East Coast trip. It wasn't too sweet, but it didn't leave you wanting more sugar either. The sides were to die for. I suggest the spinach and cream as well as the garlic mashed potatoes. The Freaking Fries were good as well. It was one of those \"can't have just one\" moments that left you hurting after the plates were clean.
I was warned, before ordering my entree, that their marinates are somewhat bland because of the flavor of their dry rub that they had in little containers on each table. I wasn't sure what I wanted so I had the Trio, and it was great. The meat so tender that they fell off the ribs and you really didn't need a knife. 

Bring your appetites, because your stomach will thank you for it."}
{"text":"I would give this place about 2.5 stars but the sweet potato fries took it to a solid 3.  I will go back just for those.  Atmosphere and service were good.  We were the only ones in there.  I got the sliders, one of each, pork, chicken, beef.  I thought they were okay.  My companion got the pulled pork sandwich.  He immediately commented that his sandwich was not warm.  I would have liked to try some of the other menu items but the price seemed high relative to the food described."}
{"text":"I order \"large beef ribs\" to go (about $16)....which comes with two sides to be chosen from a list of sides that are listed on the menu at $1.99 each. 

I want sweet potato fries which is not on the list of sides that comes with the order and is listed on the menu at $2.99. 

So I do quick math in my head, and ask the barman if I can trade the two $1.99 sides for one $2.99 side. I figure with a net gain of $.99 to the house, it would be an easy call. The barman politely says 'can't do it.'

So I call one of the management staff over; his name is Rob. I tell him what I want to do. He says 'can't do it'. 

I point out it's a trade in his favor. He says 'still can't do it'. 

I say 'but you're going to have an unhappy customer'. He says again 'can't do it'.

I should have walked out then and there, but I was starving, so I took the order with the two \"fascist\" sides.

I can only assume by my experience that this restaurant doesn't want my business...and I am more than happy to oblige.

\"More than happy to oblige\"...those are five words the management at Adam's Ribs would do well to learn."}
{"text":"Ok -- see below referenced wet behind the ears server... I popped in here today for a quick sandwich -- it was late, 1:20.  So I figured it would be an easy place to grab a quick bite.  

Since I was alone, I headed into the bar -- barstools... -- but wet-ears (asian kid, spiky hair, glasses) directed me into the dining room where there was only 1 table of 2 occupied...  \"ugh they're doing work in the bar...\"  \"Sit here, there's more ac\" (it was goosebump cold and completely unnecessary).   When I asked him where the ladies room was, he replied \"(beavis-y)  uhhhuhh, they're doing work in the men's room, so you'll have to hold your nose if you want to go to the bathroom.\"   

Since we both knew that I needed to go to the restroom, I ordered quickly -- slider combo and an arnold palmer.   \"uhhuh, our uh lemonade thing isn't working so we don't have any\"    I ordered water.  

Then five minutes later, he sheepishly returned,  holding glass,  \"uhhuh, I asked the bartender if he could make lemonade so if you don't like it, no problem...\"  (lemon, water, sugar -- yeah, tough) -- not even a full glass, then add iced tea.  Hard.  Real hard.

15 minutes after that...after watching him chat away with hostess/manager/whatever -- he comes skulking back to the table \"um, I have a confession... we don't have any brisket.\"   

It's been 20 minutes -- and he's just now telling me no brisket -- are you kidding me?   

So, I ask him, as I survey the entire empty dining room -- if he thought that his service, the poor communication with the kitchen, the lameass excuses had anything to do with the state of their business?   \"uhuh, maybe, it's just me.\"   Ya think?   

Do you think that folks who come in here for lunch have time for this foolishness?  Get your act together -- and quickly.  

Then I do what I haven't done in ages -- I left.  I asked him what I owed him for the bad arnold palmer (he correctly answers that it's on the house)  and I stood up and left.  

Couldn't believe it.  

They have bloody no business, and they think this bozo is helping them keep customers. 

Open letter to Adam Carmer -- Hotel School Professor and (allegedly) Restaurateur:

Dear Mr. Carmer, 

BBQ margaritas aren't enough to sustain or build a restaurant -- let alone a good or truly satisfied restaurant clientele.  Good food, genuine service, great values are.  Your Maryland Parkway operation is a joke.  Please, if you want your substantial investment in this location (which is much appreciated, by the way)  to matter, tap into your healthy employee base (I'm sure you have a few employees who would be interested in picking up some add'l shifts), and bring some experienced talent over.  Better yet -- you don't need a hostess/manager/multiple servers when you have (ahem) NO BUSINESS.   Get those girls on the floor -- teach them about the food and make them earn their money.  Simply reprinting menu placemats does not build business -- oh, yeah, you might have the girls read the menus too...understanding your food and the things that matter to you.  I've found, as I've meandered through the food business, that typically it's helpful, and your customers appreciate it when staff can answer questions, instead of staring at you like you've asked them to create world peace on a plate.   

Oh and in case you thought I was pussyfooting around the issue, I won't -- fire the spiky haired kid -- seriously.  Foodservice is not his calling.  I'm sure something is -- but do him, you (and your guests) a favor and please, please cut the chord so that no one has to put up with his lame excuses, and worse than that his mind bending business-ending behavior ever again.   

And you might drop me a note when he's gone -- maybe then I'll return.  Yep, that bad.

One more thing, your cook at the Flamingo location cooks circles around -- your crew at Maryland Parkway.   Oh, and from what I've seen, he can run the whole damn place singlehandedly -- and is happy and proud to do so.  His food is worth returning for -- as is his attitude.  Send him over to fix Maryland Parkway, or it's truly doomed.  Better yet,  get yourself in there to run things.  Throw the rest of them out, and show us what it is that you know.  Introduce yourself to your guests -- hell there are only about 2 of them, so it shouldn't tax you too much.  Maybe then you'll begin to rebuild your business the old fashioned way, one happy customer at a time."}
{"text":"Had a coupon from restaurant.com and decided to check this place out because who doesn't love coupons? I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and an order of ribs along with some bottles of this CREAM SODA that was like liquid heaven. I swear there was some crack in there.

My brother and I devoured the sandwiches but they were kind of dry so we drenched it with their barbeque sauce (provided on the table) and it was a winner. The ribs were well flavored, but once again dry so I had to douse them in some BBQ sauce and we were set.

The guy who served us was kind of rude and wasn't honest about the coupon's rules so we ended up spending $25 more which REALLY pissed me off and defeated the purpose of coming here for a bargain lunch. If this restaurant didn't want to take the coupons, then why bother putting them out?

Never again."}
{"text":"This time around I decided against the bbq and ordered 2 deep fried pbj & honey sandwiches.

I like the atmosphere with the bar, beer pong and all the tv's to watch the game. The hostess and servers are very friendly but the food is just.......

The PBJ was way too heavily battered and very greasy. I expected it to be cut in half and maybe a little powdered suger for $4.50 each.

It looked very undesirable and it was so greasy i barely made it through half.

Adams has been very disappointing both visits-They seem to be be focusing too much on the bar & beer pong shit to cater to the college kids they have lost track of good bbq & food in general. Very lackluster and they even threw in a free order of watermelon slices which did nothing to impress me.

I was very upset that this wasnt better than a twinkie. I will have to try my own at home to get it right."}
{"text":"Have you ever been to a bbq restaurant that ran out of chicken?!?!??!  I did last week and I'm still kinda surprised about it.  

While all the food we had was above average, the portions weren't that big and the prices they charged for some of the stuff was kinda crazy.  $8 for the grilled vegetables which consisted of just some grilled squash and zucchini and balsamic portobello.  

My wife got a 1/2 rack of ribs and coleslaw for $17 and I got the beef sampler since they didn't have any chicken.  NO CHICKEN!!  At a bbq restraurant!!  My plate consisted of tri tips, st louis ribs (baby back are way better) and brisket which was very good.  

My wife wasn't even full.  She's 87 lbs and is usually full after a burger but these ribs just didn't do it.  Crazy.  She can be full for $1.85 but not $17?!?!

We also felt like there was kind of a fast food atmosphere to the whole place.  I could've been at Aloha Kitchen for all I knew.

Anyways...I'd go to Memphis any day of the week compared to this place.  Maybe I should call ahead next time to see if chicken is available b4 I go."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I last Yelped.

It's not for lack of trying, it's just that .... well, none of the new places that I have tried out have really moved me enough to even bother to click a few buttons to give a mediocre rating to.  Yeah, it's been that kind of a ride for me the past few months.

But, like all slumps, this one had to end and boy, what a slump breaker it was!  Creamed spinach in my teeth, BBQ sauce all over my face and my hands smelling like I had been tending a bonfire all night.  It. was.GLORIOUS.

Here's the breakdown: (what we ordered tonight)

Me - Beef Trio (2 Beef Ribs, Brisket and Tri-Tip)  The brisket and tri-tip were both very tender, very juicy and practically melted in my mouth.  There was even a moment when I had a slice of brisket at the end of my fork and I was trying to pick up some of the dry rub off one of my ribs with it and it practically disintegrated.  It was THAT tender, yet very lean and not fatty at all.  

Creamed Spinach - You can tell that it's made fresh, not thawed out from a frozen glob.  My wife hates cooked spinach, but she LOVED the creamed spinach here.  It had a homemade/handmade quality to it along with everything else.  I don't know how to describe it other than \"Down-Home Gourmet\" 

Garlic Mashed Potatoes - Very VERY flavorful the whole way through.  You can also tell that it's hand-made, not powdered, with skins and all, just the way I like it.  BONUS!

Sweet Potato Fries - With Honey and Cinnamon! it's almost a dessert! This is the only place I have found here in Las Vegas where the sweet potato fries are crispy and not soggy, definitely one of my favorites. BONUS +2

Sweet Tea - One of the staples (Brisket is the other) that I HAVE TO try out at every new BBQ joint and weighs very heavily in my final tally of how a restaurant ranks because I down these suckers non-stop and Adam's did not disappoint.  It may be a little too sweet for others, but it's exactly how I like it, with a noticeable taste of brown sugar to it.  Another Bonus, these guys are just hitting me right where I live.

Pulled Pork Sandwich - (According to the wife) \"It wasn't greasy or fatty, it was just pure tender, juicy meat with a nice soft bun\"

We actually got a chance to speak with the Owner, Adam (Who also owns the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy) and he was very friendly and informative.  He introduced us to their various sauces and their incredible dry rub.  The regular sauce was a little too sweet for me, but then again, I never do regular sauces and always go for the hot stuff.  Their hot variant \"The Slow Burn\" is not an in-your-face kick you in the teeth super-hot insanity sauce.  Think of it more as a fine Sake`, deep subtle flavor (Very flavorful) with a slow burn that gradually builds at the back of your throat and catches you unawares, kind'a like the way good Sake` creeps up on you and then BAM all of a sudden, you're drunk.

The Dry Rub though, was definitely the star of the various condiments.  According to Adam, it is salt free (I believe he also said that they try to use as little salt, if any, in all of their dishes) so you can pile it on as much as you want and not feel guilty about your sodium intake.  The flavor just made my mouth water even more  it was so subtle, yet complex.  It was the perfect complement to the Brisket and tri-tip.

Look, I can just keep going on and on until my fingers get worn down to nubs, but here's the skinny.  I like me some BBQ and I definitely LOVE me some beef ribs, DRY (No sauce) Since that's the way to really tell how good a restaurant's dry rub is.  Lucille's Smokehouse taught me that and that's how I've been judging my ribs ever since, by how they compare to Lucille's and I'll be brutally honest, I like Adam's ribs better than any other BBQ place that I have tried in town, yes, even Lucille's and CJ's.  Everything we tried just tasted home-made  and not like it came off an assembly line.  These guys put a lot of love into their cooking and it shows.  Just give them one chance, you may just find yourself a new favorite BBQ place like I did."}
