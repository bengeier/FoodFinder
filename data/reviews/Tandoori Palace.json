{"text":"This is, by far, my favourite Indian restaurant. I'm a regular, and I can't say that about many ethnic restaurants in Calgary. The service is spot-on, the food is always consistently excellent, and the naan is always free with the buffet. Their curried goat or lamb are my favourites, but nearly everything is so tasty I'm usually tempted to try the veg dishes as well. Good food, low-key quiet dining with good parking and not the high costs of, say, Karma on 114th. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There are always few limited choices to choose from but they are all cooked in perfection. It is a good price for buffet with high quality food."}
{"text":"The staff here was very nice. They suggested their most popular dishes to us when we came in and prepared them quickly for us while we waited. The naan stayed soft and warm all the way home. It was delicious! I had the butter chicken and my husband had the chili chicken. Mine was creamy and wonderful. I can be a little sensitive to spices, so I was nervous that his meal would be too spicy for me. However, after I tried it I was glad I did. The chili chicken had just a little bit of a kick, but it was delicious and really not too spicy at all. Overall, the service was nice and the food was great! I only gave it four stars because it was just a little more expensive than I wanted for a quick meal out, but there was so much food that it was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! Food was fresh, many choices, good quality and the service was great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great value for the money! And friendly, smily waiters! On the night we were there it was very busy, so service was a little slow, thats why i gave 4 stars out of 5. Otherwize, looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at great food. We had butter chicken, rice and nan bread. Service was pleasant and efficient. We will return."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I had higher expectations for this place. Sadly, like Gladys C., I was disappointed with the Butter Chicken. The chicken itself was fine, it was moist and not all completely breast meat (which is rare in this city unfortunately.) But the sauce lacked flavour and was a bit soupy. The beef Samosas were good, but not great again they lacked flavour. The veggie Pakoras were pretty good but a little too salty. The Gulab Jamun were standard fair but unlike most restaurants generous in proportion. I thought that the Coconut rice was much too sweet, like they were using Sweetened Coconut shavings.

Unfortunately this is the only Indian restaurant that will deliver to our place so we may be making our own treks across the city for better food or lowering our standards."}
{"text":"I travel quite a lot and try indian food everywhere I go but I have to say the butter chicken, nan and mango lassi in this place are one of the best I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Although I am not usually a fan of buffets one of my colleagues (who happens to be Indian) inisisted on going for lunch. I was very pleasantly surprised. Most buffets have naan right in the buffet. Tandoori Palce brings fresh naan to your table which makes the meal exceptional."}
{"text":"Very good take out.  Excellent butter chicken!  Don't ask for too spicy because they make crazy spicy!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered delivery for this place and both times I was very satisfied.  I ordered the tandoori chicken and one order was enough for me and my husband.  Also the vegetarian  samasos were delicious. I called ahead to ask about a couple of menu items and the person who answered was very nice, so was the delivery man who was extremely personable. Lastly the delivery was quick, exactly 1 hour from when I placed the order online. I will be eating at this place again."}
{"text":"Really good food! We took the royal platter for two and brought back enough for a second meal!! Everything was clean.  The service was a bit slow tho! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Délicieux mets indien pour le prix. Les sauces sont savoureuses, les viandes sont tendres et juteuses même grillées, à l'exception du seekh kebab, le riz est correct et le pain naan excellent. Les choix combo sont parfaits pour essayer différents plats. Vous avez un rabais lorsque pour commandez pour emporter, qui peut se faire très facilement à l'avance en-ligne. Service sympathique que ce soit à table ou au comptoir. Le restaurant étant situé à Laval, vous trouverez sans problème du stationnement."}
{"text":"Not the best Indian buffet I have had, the selection was very slim. Food was ok, some dishes were a little dried out."}
{"text":"Went here last week and ended up having the dinner buffet, tried a bit of everything and enjoyed most of it, i don't have a lot of experience with Indian food but the butter chicken was the best I ever had! I'd defiantly  go back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for the past few years seen it change hands few times now. 
Today's visit back I noticed the menu has changed. 
The curry goat is my favourite meat dish this was cooked with onion and green peppers. This is lighter Color curry than what I normally get. It was a nice pleasant surprise. The following refill did not stew long enough the meats taste fresh but need more time for the flavour to set in. They offer 1 beef dish, 2 chicken dish. One of them is butter chicken, the other is tandoori chicken, and curry goat. The rest of the dishes are all vegetable dishes. 
You also get self serve Masala Tea included in the buffet. 
The food is always fresh from my observation. 
I keep coming back cause the food is always consistent quality. 
Food: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Atmosphere: 3.5/5 (but they are clean)

They refill everything quite efficient the staff are nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I was determined not to like this place. The location is the former location of my favorite Indian restaurant, Delhi Darbar. I was an extremely sad panda when Delhi Darbar moved to the other side of the city, and I could no longer go there 1-3 times a week like I usually did. Then, to add insult to injury, this new place wasn't open on Sundays which is when I most liked to frequent Delhi Darbar. BOOOO.

Then yesterday happened. I was out of food, recovering from the flu and too tired/lazy to go food shopping and then make something to eat. I was in the area. I wanted Indian food. I walked inside and was greeted by a friendly waitress with a warm smile on her face. 

Pros: Food was delicious. Their Bharta Eggplant was awesomesauce. Sooo many Indian restaurants in the city get that dish all wrong and sour. Probably because they use canned eggplant. Not this place! Would totally recommend that, and the Chana Masala... even the Bhindi Masala. I really liked that even though I hate okra with a passion. And the pakora was light and crispy without being greasy :D Hooray!

Cons: Usually, with Indian buffets, the food is divided in sections so that the veg-friendly dishes are in one spot, and the meat dishes are in another. Here, the food is all kind of mixed up. I was so used to the old layout, that I almost put a ladleful of beef curry on my plate. My companion said the kheer could have used more cardamom and pistachios, because it tasted just like regular rice pudding. Also, the decor could use some jazzing up. The walls are kind of a gross, boring brown. Lastly, when I put some of the Mukhwas in my mouth while paying for lunch it tasted like lavender perfume. Like someone had sprayed some cleaner all over the counter when wiping it, and got it all over the Mukhwas tray. Blergh. Still, forgivable.

All in all, I was won over and I am no longer mad at you, Tandoori Palace. I will recommend you to all my friends."}
{"text":"Okay, I like Indian food, especially butter chicken(who's not like this dish?!). I read the reviews and articles, so I had hopes high to this place. I went in yesterday. I think I was the first customer that day.

Food. Good but I guess I had high standard for butter chicken. It was not marinated long to penetrate the flavor. Beef curry was good. I didn't go for 2nd round but the sweet is very good."}
{"text":"Really good indian buffet in Laval.  Nice decor.  Has your usual indian dishes.  The deep fried caulifower is one of the best things I've ever eaten.  I often bring out of town clients here and they always ask to come back."}
{"text":"J'ai retenu qu'une approximation à peu près décevante. La première fois (en 2013) achale encore une mauvaise expérience en bouche. 
L'évaluation suivante interprète une visite plus récente (septembre 2015). Quelle différence dans leur exercice de style et tout autant de considération pour la profondeur et justesse des épices. J'apprécie toujours l'égard porté au pain naan fraîchement cuit et non ranimé de son froid du fin fond du congélateur."}
{"text":"This is a good little local restaurant. Descent weekday buffet for cheap. They have a nice selection in their menu. Safe plates and traditional dishes for first time Idian food eaters. Their naan bread is good. They have set menus for different tastes and budgets. It's not incredible but comforting food in Laval. You don't need to go to Mtl"}
{"text":"Awesome Indian lunch buffet. A variety of dishes. Butter chicken s the best. Pretty busy place, service may be lacking"}
{"text":"This is my return to a once loved indian restaurant.
This is the 3rd time back since their delivery fiasco a year ago...what was I waiting to come back?!
3 times in the last 8 days I've comed here to eat their delicious thali and Taj Mahal beer.
Why am I coming back?
Because this place is very good...other than the strange hard plastic covering the tables and the sometimes inaudible wonderful indian music playing... The red and gold curtains all around makes it one of the prettiest indian resto I have ever seen. 
You can't go wrong. This place looks good and is quiet with mostly people from the surrounding neighborhood. 
Thali is a must. Look at my pictures! 
Yummy yum yums!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worse place you can ever order from. 
I have never had such a horrible service. Food was missing and were charged for for it. We called to ask if they could send us a replacement and they told us we were lying and hung up. We called back and they told us they wouldn't bring the food if we called again. Disgusting customer service. Do not recommend to anyone!! The food was bad as well, butter chickens was bad cubes of chicken. The rice had no flavour either. HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Long story short? Mediocre. At least their lunch buffet was.

Won't get long-winded about it.. nice little resto with limited food choices regarding their lunch buffet. Butter chicken was good but I've had better. Deep fried cauliflower was good. Food looks like it was reheated. Flavor somewhat bland. Not spicy at all.

Gulab Jamun was really good and the only thing that I really enjoyed.

I felt the lunch buffet price-tag of $15 was too high. Not enough value for it.

Service consisted of 1 person, for about 30 patrons. Not very well managed. Refill came in once and we only spoke to the person when it came to pay. Don't blame her, she worked hard."}
{"text":"Je vais à ce resto le midi car il est proche du travail. Le buffet est très bon majs le service ordinaire (souvent qu'une seule serveuse pour tout le resto!). Poulet au beurre très bon et pudding au riz à l'eau de rose me fait rêver à ce resto ;)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with some co-workers, many of whom are of Indian decent.  We were all pleased - the food was a little milder than I usually like but it was tasty.  The buffet was smaller than expected, but it satisfied us and was well worth the $12.95.  
I will go back."}
{"text":"Had a craving for Indian Buffet this past weekend and came to a startling realization that while there are a lot of Indian Restaurants, and a fair number that offer lunch buffets, there really weren't that many dinner buffet options available. Now, living downtown, Tandoori Palace was a fair drive away so I really rolled the dice on coming to this spot (okay, so maybe I justified it by lumping in a visit to Ikea, a place that I love to hate). 

It's located in a strip mall beside a nail parlour, so I definitely cringed a little bit pulling up to the location. However, I was really surprised at everything after that! The restaurant itself is a tidy, unpretentious atmosphere with attentive service and most importantly, very clean. The buffet section is tucked away in the back, very tidy, reasonably stocked (which is perfect for buffet because it means the food hasn't been sitting there for many hours). 

It's an average selection - not too many items, not too few, though I wouldn't have minded a few more choices. The standouts for me were the Goat Curry (god, so tender, so flavourful, so not-goaty/gamey), and the butter chicken. Now I won't comment on how authentic it is because I really don't know, but this was definitely the best butter chicken I've had a while. The sauce was perfect and even had a touch of sweetness, and the chicken chunks were generous and real. The chicken used in most butter chicken buffets is either really tough because it's been over cooked to shit, or really really tender because it's been brined to shit and tastes more like a fast food chicken nugget consistency (not that real). The butter chicken here landed a great balance between the two. 

The fresh buttery naan was also a highlight. I do wish that there was more fruit / dessert options and veggies, but for $20, this really hit the spot for my craving. 

I would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Nothing beats a good Indian, and after so many in the UK, even their worst would be Montreal's best.  However after losing touch with places like Sitar, this discovery was a hidden gem.  They offer buffet at lunch and a la carte after 5 pm.  I'm always reluctant about buffet but I have to say Tandoori Palace does it right.  They don't inundate you with a huge selection but rather a few prime choices of quality.  Items are super fresh since they don't attempt to put out trays of food en masse. Prices are great, restaurant is cozy and clean and the food is awesome.  Bring the kids on the weekend, cause even my picky eater enjoyed it, along with the other younglings that were present.  They also deliver very quickly and the prices and portions are more than fair."}
{"text":"Good flavour, tasty dishes and generous portions. I did not like the lunch buffet , i think the food was reheated; i did try many dishes from the regular menu previously and really enjoyed it. I am not a fan of decor and its a little bit gloomy. Suitable fir families but i don't think its a place were kids enjoyed their time.  I would definitely come back again. 4 stars for the regular menu, 3 for the buffet and the service."}
{"text":"This place is not bad either. I went here for my birthday at lunch for their buffets. They were close to closing so the restaurant was quiet with one nice lady serving. I was happy with the food. Compared to typical buffets they kept their items under 10 and did a good job on keeping everything fresh and tasteful. They only had gulab jamun for desserts so I couldnt really have much for sweets, but overall the food was good. I will try out some other time for their a la carte menu which looks promising. They even have a huge room which caters to a good number of people for reception parties or other events."}
{"text":"Je ne suis jamais allé au restaurant. J'ai commandé à une seule reprise et c'est la dernière fois ! Il manquait un plat sur ma commande et le staff ainsi que le propriétaire m'ont dit que je l'avais reçu et que j'appelais pour en avoir un second. Je suis encore sous le choc par le type d'accusations que le propriétaire a le culot de proférer. J'ai eu a rappeler à trois reprise après m'être fait raccrocher la ligne au nez par le propriétaire qui me sortait :  \" we have 1 million $ of sales at the restaurant we dont have time for this \" \"  why are you making a story for your butter chicken \" 

C'est vraiment déplorable de parler à un client de la sorte. Vraiment désolant. On est en 2018 et j'espère que ce me passeras pas inaperçu et si vous avez l'occasion de commander chez eux, ne le faites pas, vous vous éviterez une soirée gâchée."}
{"text":"I got here right when they opened for dinner so everything in the buffet was fresh and steaming.  I would have given five stars if they had a little more selection as the buffet is quite small.  What they do have is excellent though, it was obvious that they take the time to make everything themselves and it tasted amazing. The naan bread they bring you was awesome too.  The woman working there (who I'm assuming was am owner) was very nice and chatted with us for a bit. Overall, food was good, service was good, and the buffet is really well priced. Will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"Delicious food my favorite chicken masala anywhere, love the onion bhaji too, a must try, nice place inside."}
{"text":"Great fine Indian cuisine in Laval. Only place in Laval where you can eat authentic Indian food.

I always make reservation to avoid waiting or being squeezed between tables.

I tried the lunch buffet twice and it is as good as the menu food.

I never ordered at home and therefore cannot comment on the quality of the delivery service."}
{"text":"My family and i came here to celebrate my cousin's first pay check as a doctor. I know. Any excuse that we can come up with to see each other is great lol! We were around 26-28 people and they had more then enough food for all of us. Believe me when i say that our family of small, little vietnamese people, we CAN eat like champions! So... We chose to come here for the lunch buffet. At only 12,95$ per person, it's quite a bargain!

Now for the food. The buffet offers a small variety of classic indian dishes. Amongst other things, you will find the samosa, the tandoori chicken, the veal masala and the infamous butter chicken. All the dished that has sauce in them were way too salty! It felt like it was done on purpose so you would fill yourself with naan bread, dry basmati rice and water. I'm pretty sure it's a trick that some buffet restaurants do. It's too bad because the flavours were there. The cool thing was the 5-6 different sauces-condiments! 

Recap.Service is nothing out of this world. 
Food was very salty. Prices are very reasonable! Will i come back? No. There are much, much better indian restaurants in Montreal. I know. This restaurant is in Laval. But the Lachapelle bridge to cross over to Montreal is 2 minutes away :)"}
