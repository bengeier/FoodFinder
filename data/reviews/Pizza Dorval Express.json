{"text":"I ordered on a Tuesday at 6:01pm. The food did not show up until 7:01pm.  I didn't complain but I did not tip either. The delivery guy gave me a hard time for not getting a tip. He stood at my door for quite a while complaining and saying if I was that poor, he would give me a few dollars. I'm polite but I'm no slouch, I told him it was over an hour old and whether he liked it or not, I wasn't tipping.

The pizza is above average but the spaghetti is not so hot."}
{"text":"I gave them several chances and ordered other items too besides the pizza and guess what everything is either stale or weird tasting.  I think they use substandard ingredients and take too long to deliver I would not order anything from this place.  Careless, irresponsible and lazy operator and poor staff.  Avoid this place at any cost."}
{"text":"Useless shitbag place only sells 2 pizzas. How about people who only want one pizza. Don't bother."}
{"text":"best pizza around the airport area. their service is exceptional and the price is very reasonable.

only order FRESH pizza. do NOT go for the pizza slices those are probably sitting their for hours and hours."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and fairly priced.  One of the last pizza places in Dorval."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my family and I can say I really enjoyed the place. 

Had an awesome deal that had something that we all wanted for such a great price. The seating is ample, price was a bargain, and the place is well kept. Lots of variety in case you have some picky eaters in the group or want to explore different options. 

Workers (2 I had encounters with) were super friendly and accommodating to all of our needs. 

Would definitely recommend and would return too. 

Don't let the name \"express\" deter you from having a quality sit down meal!"}
