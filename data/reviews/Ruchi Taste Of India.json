{"text":"When I went into the restaurant it was very clean and the owner was very helpful on going through the menu with me and helping me to decide what to order. The food was hot and packaged in a way to not spill on the way home. The food was FANTASTIC!
I ordered the veggie samosas, goat curry and garlic naan. I look forward to going back again."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero star, I would. Everything here is terrible - from quality of food to service. Kitchen is filthy, I wonder how they ever cleared inspection! I bet it was not vacuumed or sanitized since they started. I ordered non-veg Thali so I could get to try the several items that come with it. It was a rude shock that they served only 6 of the listed items. I had to ask for everything from silverware to napkins to dessert (which was a scoop of chocolate ice cream- I expect Indian dessert when I eat at an Indian restaurant, plus that was the only dessert offered even though the menu listed two as part of this meal). Words cannot describe my disappointment with this place. It's a bunch of guys running this place with no idea how to manage a restaurant or even the basics of service- one was busy texting, the others were equally disinterested. How anyone would give this place a 4/5 star is a mystery- I'm sure they didn't get a sneak peak of the kitchen. I'm never going back, even If this is the last restaurant open in the city."}
{"text":"Ate the buffet.  Friday.  $12.99.

This place is next door to the taco shop that closed.  Pretty small.  Fully loaded, it may seat a couple dozen-  elbows bumping. This hurts purveyors of buffet foods.  You get a fat guy like me in there eating 4 times the typical person's fill and taking up 8 of your 24 seats.

Alright!  I'm going to immediately issue a complaint:  There were NO Tikka Masala Nachos.  Closest I could come was a basket on naan triangles topped with paneer, chicken legs and cucumber sauce.

On the buffet they had chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, a couple of biryanis, fish curry, jasmine rice, some kind of boiled egg curry and a couple of other items.  They brought out a basket of naan and a small desert, that I wasn't familiar with- some kind of bread pudding.  Then gave me a to go cup of mango lassie.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you may note that I don't review food quality of buffets- especially Indian Buffets which are notorious for having much lower quality buffet items than what you can get ordering from the menu.  Either way, I'm like that guru in the Documentary, Eat the Sun.
\"What did he eat?\"
\"He ate everything!\"
\"What do you mean, everything?\"
\"He ate everything! Everything!\" -probably not the exact quote.

I liked the staff very much.  Very nice people."}
{"text":"We dined in on a Sunday evening after doing a little shopping in the area. The restaurant was small but welcoming. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The chicken tikka masala and malai kofta were rich in flavor with just the right amount of heat (we ordered medium level). The garlic naan was delicious! I'm looking forward to returning to try their buffet!"}
{"text":"My friend and I have gotten food from here multiple times now and we absolutely love it! The staff is very kind and accommodating. The food is incredible. Absolutely incredible. It's so flavorful and fresh and my mouth is watering just thinking about it! The saag paneer and the butter chicken are my favorites! Definitely give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Food- great flavors and very good quality. Had Tikka Masala and Guntur Kodi Kura. Samosa was also tasty!  
Service very good with just the right amount of attention when needed. 

Some .......Did not have mango lassi available and also two other dinner dishes (on the menu) was not available. 

I will be back... to try the buffet."}
{"text":"Went there for the lunch buffet the food was evenly heated. They had a good variety of food for meat eaters and vegetarians. I really enjoyed the food, it wasn't the typical food I order at Indian restaurants so it was nice to try some different dishes. One or two of the dishes were a bit spicy, nothing outrageous and I prefer spicy foods. But if you have a sensitive stomach, make sure to ask. Service was great, very attentive. Another table ordered these soft rice cakes and the server had an extra order which she gave to us. It had a very simple taste that allowed you to use a chutney or sauce as you liked. I wasn't a big fan, but my dad enjoyed it and it help cut the more spicy foods. Great experience and would go again to try some of their other food. Also, very affordable buffet."}
{"text":"Very disappointed, we order carry out, first he said 20 mins, we left then we came back, then he said 10 mins. We left again and we came back after 15 mins. He told us 5 mins, we waited inside the restaurant. Then he said sorry we have a lot of carry out orders. But when came in the first time, the host was bored and the phone was not ringing off the hook. All of sudden a half hour later you have a lot carry out orders. It took forever to get our food, but I hate to say food was excellent. Would of gave them 4 stars, if it was for the long ware"}
{"text":"Fantastic little buffet, flavors are nothing crazy or inventive but definitely surpass the other Indian food in the area. Affordable and super accommodating staff went out of there way to take care of my family during our meal and will definitely visit again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Small place. good variety of options in buffet and on the menu. 
Naan is very good.The food is spicier than average which I like"}
{"text":"I have never seen such a successful Indian restaurant! We've gone twice and both times this relatively new place was packed. The food is hot and fresh and authentic. It's the first time I've actually gotten to eat some of the food I had when I was in South India. I've never found it at other restaurants! The service is inparalleled! They keep bringing fresh naan or roti. This time we even got to try their homemade ice cream which was incredible. If it's possible to find a negative it's only that it's so popular that the seating is packed...but to me that's part of the fun, getting to see other families especially non-caicasian ones :)"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch buffet is $9.99. It's $12.99 fri-sun, as there is either fish or shrimp curry on those days. The quality of the food was good, well seasoned and served warm. The naan served left much to be desired but I don't believe in eating too much of that at a buffet anyway. I ordered something a la carte as well and was quite pleased with it. My gripe is that the menu is outdated; the prices are actually 20% higher than advertised and there is a section of lunch and dinner sets that is not even offered any more.  Service is friendly and attentive, but please update your menus!"}
{"text":"It was Labor Day and everything was closed... Except Ruchi! I tried this on a whim having been to Jaipur Junction in the past and wow, I'm lucky I did. Loved this place. Chicken Tikka was great, Nan was flavorful, and owners were very nice. I'm not a fan of the buffet, but I highly recommend you order off the menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered butter chicken for take out. Came out very fast steaming hot. Super fresh! I also like that I got to pick my spice level! Will be back!"}
{"text":"We were there around 6:30 and no one was there. Turns out they've only been open for one month. They had a few pick up orders though. I only got a few things but everything was excellent.  Best Garlic  Naan I have had in a very long time. Thin and light and very tasty. Service was great, three men took care of us. This place is not for people who don't know Indian food. Their menu is a little hard to  understand .   I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Paneer Masala. It was very good food. It's really seems authentic."}
{"text":"Buffet Style.  Eat in and takeout.  Good Indian food.  Butter Chicken really good.  Mexican Coke in a glass bottle."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with great Indian food. Quality is good and the dishes are very flavorful. Also, a nice variety of dishes. There is a daily lunch buffet and lunch & dinner buffets Friday-Sunday. I missed the buffet, but the dishes listed for it sounded great."}
{"text":"If you love real Indian this is a place to try. The in dining is very small so we have ordered take out each time. The person who answered the phone has a thick accent and is hard to always understand. I always have them repeat the order to make sure they understood me. If you like it hot then ask for a 7 and make sure you have TUMS near by. Hot is very hot which is good. The chicken is moist and flavorful. The naan is fresh and hot with each order. I'm not a huge rice person but the Jasmine rice is very good. All the plates are delicious. I only gave it a four star because of the communication issue placing an order. I have very little patience I think if you have a business you should have someone who can communicate with the customers. Sorry not racist just an very strong suggestion."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much when we arrived, but the food was good and the people were nice. The Paneer Tikka Masala was quite good - the paneer was made with Amish cheese. The Vegetable Biryani wasn't bad, but we probably would have liked it sweeter. 

The owner was very eager to please - perhaps a little too eager. He was hovering nearby. Clearly wants to grow the business. 

All in all, a good meal."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. Savory, well-balanced and super tasty. We've had Indian food all over the US from dives to fine dining and this might be the best so far. Cute little place with friendly staff. Food couldn't be better."}
{"text":"In the words of my five year old \"Oh my goodness gracious! This is the best!\"
Will update with details and pictures soon but in the meantime, yes, go here."}
{"text":"Stay away!! We were so excited about new Indian place nearby, but it was a full disappointment.
Fake reviews written by family & friends here & also on Google. Very unorganized, salty food. Only few items on the menu were available. In non-veg only chicken tikka & butter chicken. 
We were sitting forever for food, then they brought curries...shahi paneer had no paneer inside just gravy... when asked they said the paneer was crushed.... chicken tikka was way too salty...oh yes...nan showed up 15mins after curries. When we were done halfway through the food... they brought in rice.
They were only open for a week and look at the reviews on google all of them written before."}
{"text":"It's official. My new favorite India restaurant. The buffet does not loose quality. Every dish is super flavorful! Wish good success for them."}
{"text":"I am still a newbie to Indian food so we came for the Sunday lunch buffet so I could try a variety of dishes. Everything I tried was delicious! I was told they buy fresh from local farmers. The staff was very friendly and they kept replenishing our water and fresh naan bread. The tikki masala and rice was good. They finished with bringing us a sweet desert (some type of rice pudding)."}
{"text":"This is delicious South Indian where my Indian friend took me because she thought it was so good.  Great for takeout and they also have a buffet lunch. It's a nice change of pace from other Indian restaurants and you'll try a lot of dishes you've never had before in NE Ohio. The people are really nice, too."}
{"text":"A lot of interesting nuances about THIS Indian restaurant. Stopped in for their lunch buffet - on Saturday! Most others don't do buffet on weekends. Dishes were a little different than mainstream Indian restaurants. Their flavors were deeper and more diverse. They brought fresh naan to the table. They also brought their signature rice dessert to the table as well. This place's food and service is really 5-star."}
{"text":"Very welcome addition to the area. Lunch buffet is very good. They have new items often, many of which I have not tried before. It's exciting to see what they have on any given day. They bring out fresh naan to your table and it is warm, crispy in some spots, yet pillowy soft in others. Only complaint I have is that the food is on the spicier side. It's not a bad spicy, but I think my kid would have an issue with that level. If you like some heat, you will like it here. Service has always been great at lunch. They seems to really care about their customers and want to make sure you are enjoying your meal.

I have gone for dinner on a Saturday and the entire place was packed with people- good sign. There was only one server but he was handling it great under the circumstances and everyone had their food in an orderly fashion. Pretty impressive.

We have visited four times now and each time we have left happy; therefore, they get 5 stars. All in all, a solid restaurant with great food and service. I'm happy they are here and I hope they stay."}
{"text":"Great new place with focus on Andhra style cuisine. Excellent taste. We ordered the boneless chicken biryani, the chicken 65, and the babai idli. More than enough for a family of three. Located in the strip mall facing Aurora road, it has a few tables to sit. The server was friendly and helpful. Apparently they cater too. Looking forward to more food from Ruchi."}
{"text":"So I'm felling under the weather today and I'm not doing any cooking.  I decided to try out this new Indian place in Aurora . It super new. I came early to beat the rush. It's a small place. Yellow walls, a few mirrors, and a few hot plates are out because they are setting up for a buffet. There were no to-go menus yet, but the regular menu was just fine. The only problem I could see was that the menu did not describe the dishes. So if you aren't familiar with Indian food, you really would not know what you are ordering. Lucky for me, I have a clue. But truthfully, even I didn't know a lot of the dishes. 

The taste of the food is excellent. This is really an authentic kind of place. Somebody really knows how to cook in that kitchen. The butter chicken and naan  is a must. 

The staff was extremely kind and incredibly thankful for our business. That is so sweet. They were excited to take the order and even carried it out to my car. Now that is service!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Clean welcoming environment. Food is really good with plenty of options for vegetarians and non vegetarians"}
{"text":"The BEST Indian food I've had. The flavors are so rich and absolutely DELICIOUS. The customer service is also A+. I recommend Ruchi to all foodies like myself!!"}
{"text":"Great family business with authentic Indian food and always hot and ready to eat! Awesome for a late dinner thru the week.."}
