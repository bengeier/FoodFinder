{"text":"This review is only for the dim sum service.  Food: Varied Dim Sum selection, in my personal opinion, better than the Dim Sum options in downtown. Always hot when it comes to the table, ye!  Service: Usually fairly quickly but sometimes takes time to pay the bill  Price: Average price  Ambiance: Bigger space and better lighting, and the rest... well there will always be tons of people and noise at any Dim Sum place..."}
{"text":"Acceptable dim sum place nothing special. We went on a Saturday morning, somehow the parking was difficult."}
{"text":"I have eaten at here with my family for over 6 years. Sometimes it's good, sometimes not. Their dim sum is okay, but there are some stand out dishes such as stir-fried water spinach, crispy chicken or vegetable & tofu chow mein, etc. The only thing is that you have to watch carefully for the foods they serve on that day. One time I found a worm in my stir-fried snowpeas."}
{"text":"They now have a new restaurant on Laurentian Blvd. at the corner of Gouin Blvd. Dim sum are great. Most patrons on a Sunday for dim sum are chinese. That speaks volumes."}
{"text":"The second you enter Tong Por, you notice the vast amount of space.  From what I've heard about the place, you could be waiting for quite the while on peak days.  This was a Thursday noon hour service, so seating was affordable.  The waiters, who were the ones who seated the customers, made sure that all new tables were seated closer to the window area.  You'd think that you would get the chance to sit down and acclimatize yourself to the restaurant, but that's when the action started.  I swear, I wasn't even seated yet and we already had something like 3 dishes on the table.    The one thing to note when you're doing Dim Sum is the language barrier.  If you have someone who can communicate with the ladies pushing the carts, you should be fine.  You're also quite covered if you have someone who knows what's on the carts.  But, if you should find yourself completely shut out of those two situations, patience will become the biggest virtue.  While I knew what most of the dishes were, the ones that were new to me cause a little bit of hesitation.  However, we got everything we came for.  For anyone who is trying Dim Sum for the first time, you have to realize that there is a learning curve.  There is a lot of hit and miss that goes into this.  If you don't know what to get, you will feel lost.  It might seem like everything is going on too fast.  But, with more experience, you'll learn how to pick and choose what you want to get the best out of it.  Tong Por, which serves Dim Sum daily until 3 p.m., is one of the top places to go to for that service, in my opinion.  You'll find that the quality of their offerings rival anything you can get in Chinatown.  Its location allows it to cater to people who cannot necessarily travel so far.  For a time, you'll think that you're deep in Chinatown, enjoying the best of what it has to offer."}
{"text":"It is probably the worst Dim Sum experience I have ever had. Last time I was there half the fish were dying in the tank.. Totally avoid anything coming out of there. The carpets and bathroom are filthy. The kitchen looked unclean when I peaked through through the door. Given all that, I am not sure how clean the food is? I guess you take risk eating there. You think that management/owner learned something from being closed down and fined by the health inspectors, well apparently not. Final insult, the person greeting was totally rude and full of herself. Notwithstanding, that is virtually no parking. Never going back in this lifetime."}
{"text":"The dim sum here was pretty bad.  But the service was surprisingly good.  Dim sum houses are not normally known for their friendly waitstaff, but one of the push cart ladies here was quite attentive and promptly brought me things (chang fen, Chinese broccoli) when I asked."}
{"text":"I struggle with Chinese establishments outside of the Chinatown core. I thank all my Asian friends that force me out of my comfort zone to try these random joints. This one's Tong Por in Ville Saint Laurent, and you'd only be here if you got lost on your way going to IKEA, or if you go to C&T for your Asian groceries.   I've been to Tong Por on numerous occasions: birthdays, dim sum lunches and for take out on random nights. It's legit, quite spacious, clean and good enough to satisfy your msg cravings.  I've had better dim sum here than in downtown, surprisingly enough.   As for their regular menu, I take the Cantonese chow mein, yang chow fried rice, a side of veggies and the other random things my parents like. It's all you need. Life is good at Tong Por."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what's the hype about this place. It's really terrible in every possible way. I went during dinner service so my review does not include their sim sum.  First thing first, I called 3 hours beforehand to reserve a place for 3, they said they don't take any reservations for 3 people. Seriously, what kind of restaurant does this? Never have I heard before that reservation requires a certain amount of people, where's the equality in this?  The food portion is really small comparing to other Chinese restaurants I've been to. We ordered the Black Bean Beef, Chinese Broccoli Shrimp and Salt & Pepper Pork Chops. I counted literally 7 shrimps which was not properly gutted, meaning the shrimps' intestines were still there and it tasted disgusting.  For the Black Bean Beef, all I saw were onions and bell peppers, the amount of meat is pitiful. The pork chops were alright, but slightly too oily.  The common problem with all the three dishes were: lack of seasoning. Almost no taste whatsoever, just...bland.  Probably went on an off day, but I would never return again regardless."}
{"text":"I went here for dim sum with my sister and a friend on a weekday morning. We had a number of dishes: shumai, har gao, cheun fan with shrimp, char siu bao, taro puffs, and a few others that I was too stuffed to sample. I was surprised that the baked char siu bao had a sugary coating on top, something that was new to me, but since I have a sweet palate I enjoyed it. Otherwise, I would say the quality and variety is comparable to restaurants in Chinatown, and even with over-ordering and having left-overs to take home the price was reasonable.   There is free parking in the lot, however you'll want to get there early if you don't want to be driving around and waiting for a spot to open up (easily the worse part of going there)."}
{"text":"Nourriture EXCELLENTE. Nous avons commander pour emporter le combo A pour deux personnes à 40$. Les portions étaient grosses et les trois mets ainsi que la soupe étaient délicieux."}
{"text":"Good Chinese restaurant. The dishes are not very authentic but taste is very salty and addictive so very good nonetheless. The dining hall is very big and there is plenty of room for very large groups on short notice even. The servers are quirky but friendly."}
{"text":"Really big place with lots of locals frequenting it which is always a good sign! The cart ladies came by and were mostly unable to speak any language I could speak... but I still tried a variety of Dim Sum and overall I really haven't enjoyed this type of cuisine at all.   Maybe I simply can't find my niche for this food.   In particular I didn't find some plates very fresh and I definitely noticed an unattended cart with food that was left unattended about 40 minutes or so before they put the served it to people. The ladies who moved the carts took many breaks to talk while we waited about for more food.  We ate a decent amount (AYCE) and it cost us about $15. Not for me. Won't be back. Hopefully I can find a place with decent Dim Sum at some point."}
{"text":"Amazing dim sum but impossible parking on weekends! Also quite affordable; we ate like kings and walked out of there with $16 ea. in damages. Worth every penny and more!"}
{"text":"Dimsums are not bad. But dinner was poorly done. The chicken and duck were really dry. Portions were small for the price. Our waiter was good but others were sloppy. It has more of a south Asia taste to the food and not really good Cantonese favour. Would I go back? Not really want to. But since they are the only one with handy cap access, there is no other choice:)"}
{"text":"We were in the mood for some Dim Sum and I had heard that this is one of the better places outside of Brossard and Chinatown. You can tell that they must do a pretty steady Chinese wedding-party business with the stage motif in the front! Decor inside is your classic Chinese restaurant!  This place is huge and cavernous but we had an excellent selection of pretty much everything you can expect: fried, steamed, greasy noodles, chicken feet, tripe, har gow siu mai, char siu baau!  Carts kept rolling around the whole time we were there and different selections! No nonsense attitude by the cart ladies and the owner is pretty much par for the course at many establishments and this was no difference!  Trekking down to Brossard is a PITA for me so this may be my Dim Sum fix when not in Toronto as these people seem to know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"Good dim sum. Avoid going during peak hour (weekends midday) or you will not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding. It can look quite pretty if the walls are all dressed in white & uplights. It's amazing what you can do w/ lighting. It was probably quite hard to manage all the dishes with approximately 50 tables as some dishes came in different order. Usually for a Chinese 10 course meal there's an 'order' but does it matter? It looks the same inside. Wait staff were very friendly and efficient.   Menu included Lobster salad with cashew nuts - this was nice and reminded me of a thai mango salad Fresh steam scallops - nice and chewy Deep fried shrimp balls and crab balls - I liked the crab balls but not so much the shrimp  \"Shark fin\" soup with crab meat - needs more crab meat or 'shark fin' Abalone saute with king mushrooms - by this dish I was already full. The abalone was kind of hard to chew. Steam dry scallops saute with garlic - the scallop was good Steam salty chicken - very tasty and salty Steam greenbass fish with soya sauce - this was served to us last but it was delicious Fried rice with dry scallops and shrimp - my favourite Cantonese style noodles - average  Lots of parking at the plaza."}
{"text":"Wow and wow, after many years living in California and Las Vegas, I would have never imagined myself finding a great Chinese restaurant in Montreal, the place where Asian population is not that much.   Tong Por, you proved me wrong. My extended family and I visit the restaurant on Saturday and the place was packed, even though it's a pretty big restaurant. We ordered a bunch of food (salt & pepper lobster, prawn, razor clams, Chinese broccoli beef, and many more.) All the food came out hot and they were all excellence. The razor clam, which I tried for the first time, was nicely cooked and juicy, the lobster and prawns was crispy and not oily at all. Everything was sooooooooooo good, I wanted to keep eating even though I was stuffed.   Want to know what was even more amazing? All that food that fed 15 adults very well only cost less than $250 bucks ( $ 1 CA dollar = $1.10 US dollar). Wow and wow. If I ordered the same thing in California or Las Vegas, it would have been over 400 bucks and the quality wouldn't even be that good.   By the way, Tong Por also served Dim Sum. Their Dim Sum is on the average side. So if you come to Tong Por, go for their menu items."}
{"text":"We did not want to drive to Chinatown with all the construction going on in Montreal. After searching the web, we found an old article in CyberPresse about Tong Por. We called and they were opened for Dim Sum. Located in the middle of the Little Maghreb area (mosques, etc.), Tor Pong did not stick out. Once in, we found a huge restaurant with loads of tables. When you go eat at a restaurant like Tong Por, it's to share a good table, talk and laugh, read a newspaper, and share these delicious little dumplings. The carts, Hong Kong style, are loaded with delicious bites, the calmars, the tripes and hineycomb, the chicken feet, the shrimp dumplings. Portions are well balanced. The noise level is typical of these sorts of restaurants but you feel confident that the food is super fresh and delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Probablement la place où tout Asiatique de Montréal vient de temps à autre. On rencontre toujours une connaissance.  \"Comfort food\" et bon prix. Plusieurs choix dans le menu - les combos sont toujours très intéressants et déjà complets.  Le goût était bien malgré une soirée achalandée avec 2 partys en même temps. Service rapide comme d'habitude."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a pretty big restaurant. Typical Chinese-looking restaurant. The parking lot gets pretty busy at peak hours and is a little bit hard to navigate.  FOOD: I always enjoy the food here. Whether it's Dim Sum or if I'm coming for dinner, the food is always to my liking. Although I will say that their meat doesn't always taste the freshest. I have yet to find a dish that I do not like. Probably my go-to spot for Chinese food when I'm with family. I do find the dishes a bit greasy but that's normal for this kind of cuisine. Another plus is that their portions are quite generous.  PRICE: Prices are standard, nothing TOO expensive on the menu (for lunch and dinner). I'd say the main dishes range from 11-16$ at dinner time. Dim Sum tends to add up quickly to just be aware of your paper slip when they check off ordered items.  SERVICE: It's your typical Chinese service. Not the best but it's what I expect from a Chinese restaurant. Some are friendlier than others. They do what they have to do."}
{"text":"C'est délicieux ce restaurant, si vous aimer les dim sum, ils sont super bons."}
{"text":"We searched for dinner in chinatown montreal very late at night. i think close to midnight and stumbled upon this place only because it was one of the few still open. The place was pretty full for the time of night but then again they were prob the only place still serving food.  We walk in and get seated. their table cloths are not table cloths but merely white garbage bags sheeted over the table. i understand, easy cleaning. the dishes were dirty. one of the cups had a fortune cookie stuck to the inside, as if it was not even washed!!   we had 7 people and ordered 5 dishes, a pot of rice to share and they gave us \"lai tong\" the usual free msg soup. we had peking porkchops which we decent, pretty good. the next dish was a joke- some salt and pepper shrimp which werent even the nice big shrimps. they were those cheap frozen bags of shrimp that they battered up and fried. although it was nicely fried. it was $13 and i think each person had about 2 shrmps. it was pretty tasty also but the quality of the shrimp was not worth the price tag. we had watercress which was okay. they asked if we wanted spice and we said a little bit. all they did was slice up some jalapenos and slide it into the veggies! bootleg. then came the chicken. SUPER dry. super tasteless. yes i understnad they give us a small dish of salt to dip it in but the chicken was the worst dish of the night. and finally we had mongolian beef which was deep fried so hard like beef jerky. that was not great either.  the place felt dirty compared to restaurants i've been to and granted, came out to be $15US per person for a decent meal. the waiters were nice as well, but on our way walking back to our hotel we all had to speed to blow up the toilets!! be aware!! i probably would recommend you go look for dinner earlier if you want to have a decent meal! and def would not recommend this place. also wouldnt recommend getting mixed drinks here becuase they had a makeshift bar in the front with a sink???"}
{"text":"More like a one star compared to china or HK but it's the closest dim sum to our homer also service was a minus one star"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with dim sum, and I was taken aback right away by the size of the restaurant. There was a massive lineup as well, we were a group of 5 and we waited about 20 minutes before being seated. Once seated, we grabbed pretty much everything that the servers offered us. That included shrimp, chicken feet, beef, greens, crab... I enjoyed every single thing I had besides the chicken feet. My only complaint was we asked for water and soda at least 3 times before our servers finally brought some, which was right about when we were already finished our meal. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend's family (who are Mauritian) on a Sunday night for his mom's birthday dinner. The decor is decent, nothing too outstanding.  Although the place was only 1/3 full, it took the waiters awhile to acknowledge us. Five minutes of waiting around later, we were finally seated, without menus. I had to go over to another table where they were all set on and picked up some. A waiter finally came over to bring us water and although we asked for utensils, as only chopsticks are offered on the tables, he walked away with them in hand instead of giving them to us. He finally came back to bring them to us, and took our order.   We ordered the seafood soup, crab balls (YUM), beef & Chinese broccoli, crispy chicken, chow fun with black bean sauce, chicken chow mein, shrimp fried rice, Cantonese-style lobster and just regular steamed rice. We had asked to have the crispy chicken and steamed rice served simultaneously, but the waiter got all in a huff and said he can only bring things out as they are ready from the kitchen.   Our food started to trickle out slowly but surely, and here is what I thought; - The crab balls, although were pretty tasty, were a lot smaller than say at Kam Fung (for 3$ a piece you'd think they'd offer a little more sustenance). - The beef & Chinese broccoli was pretty good, although the meat could've been less tendon-y. Good flavouring though. - The crispy chicken was a let-down; it was pretty dry, and didn't taste too fresh. - The chow fun with black bean sauce was pretty delicious; it was my first time having it and I enjoyed it. - I have nothing but good things to say about the chicken chow mein; it had a good mix of crispy noodles and fully cooked ones. And the veggies weren't soggy as they sometimes end up being.  - The shrimp fried rice was pretty good, mind you they were pretty cheap with the shrimp; they sprinkled maybe 10 mini shrimp throughout the whole dish.  I don't eat lobster, and didn't have any seafood soup, so I can't critique those.  I was really hoping to get the lentil soup for dessert (soooo good), but, and I know this is stereotypical, I have a feeling because I was at the table (I'm Caucasian, and my boyfriend's family, as I mentioned is Chinese-Mauritian) the waiter brought orange slices and fortune cookies.   So all in all, it was ok, but I will stick with my tried and true Kam Fung."}
{"text":"The best dim sum in Montreal with service literally à la cart!!  I am very picky with dim sum being Chinese and their dishes and assortment are great and of good quality."}
{"text":"I never go to Tong Por for anything other than dim sum. But this time, it was my nephew's first birthday and my cousin had the party here. Wow what a pleasant surprise! The food was way better then expected. We had shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings as well as king crab as amuse-bouche. Then came the 10 course meal. Yup... 10! Everything was good and came out hot! We started off with won ton soup. Then some fried shrimp and pork patties, bird's nest with meats, seafood and vegetables. Then came the mix salt and pepper seafood, roasted chicken, ginger and scallion lobster, shrimp fried rice, some green vegetables, sweet and sour fish and finally cantonese chow mein!!! It was good! We were stuffed! We were happy! Oh ya... Service was great as well! After eating at Tong Por for many, many years (since my childhood), i've finally discovered a whole new restaurant!"}
{"text":"When my friends and I arrived at the restaurant we were informed that there wasn't dim sum anymore for the day and that we'd have to order soon as the kitchen was closing for the break between lunch and dinner. We quickly made our decisions and the food was brought out promptly.   I've only had pork in the salty spice before and not beef. It was just as good except that I found a lot of the meat was mostly fat.   Since we arrived at the end of the lunch rush the restaurant staff was cleaning up and the vacuum was quite loud for a period of time."}
{"text":"Good dim-sum, plenty of variety and the carts keep coming. That being said it is very much out of the way from the west or downtown. Much preffered the old Tong Por in Chinatown or Ruby Rouge which is still pretty good and more convenient."}
