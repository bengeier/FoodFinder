{"text":"A good, if a bit pricey, breakfast place. Meal was filling and came fast and was good all around. Staff were very helpful with a couple extra requests. It is more than I would normally pay for a breakfast, but given food quality and the business's location I'm more than okay with that as an every once in a while thing."}
{"text":"I had heard much about Red's, Most of it saying the food was good, so I went one quiet mid morning to check it out. I won't be back. The food was good enough, but nothing special. Okay I guess if you're wanting grease after a long night partying.   The service however was awful. The server I had was quite efficient, but not overly friendly. The other girl could be heard all over the room, whether she was visiting with her friends, or berating customers.  Long story short, there are better places in the neighbourhood, and I won't be sending people there."}
{"text":"We went to Red's for brunch this morning and really enjoyed it! The staff was friendly and quick to seat us. Our coffees were hot and both the blueberry buckwheat pancakes and the daily special, egg tostadas were delicious. The atmosphere is fun and relaxed, it was obvious that the staff knew lots of the regular customers. I think we'll be back soon, the food was awesome although only four stars since it was somewhat pricey."}
{"text":"I like Reds.  Every time I go, I try to have something different on the menu. Today, it was the Southwestern Omelette, served with a side of chunky, fresh salsa.  Nommie.  I ordered it without onions, but it came with onions. When I realized they were green onions, instead of gross chunks of yellow or red onions that cause my digestive system to do evil things, I was OK with it.  The server, whose name I wanted to get but forgot, since she's working every time I'm there, said 'oh no, onions! Wait ...'  But I insisted the green onions were fine. In fact, I should have suggested they make the change on the menu to reflect their use of green onions, instead of their icky bulb cousins.  The portions are considerable -- omelette plus of a side of hashbrowns -- so much that I couldn't finish my multigrain toast.  My friend had the pancakes, which I've tried before and loved.   I appreciate the vegan and gluten-free options, although I'm a meat eater and a grain feeder. The menu gives me the opportunity to enjoy breakie with my pickier friends.  The coffee refills were non-stop and our server wasn't merely pleasant. She was quite cheerful and humorous at times.  I find it a little much to pay 30 bucks for an omelette and some pancakes but I love the ambience at Red's and the food has always been good."}
{"text":"What a nice quiet place to have breakfast!  Staff were extra friendly and breakfast was good!"}
{"text":"They have a basic breakfast menu with daily specials. Service was nice, coffee was very good, food was regular. Prices were high."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and I loved the online reservation system- all restaurants should do it. It's definitely pricey for a diner but the portions are huge and the food was so tasty. I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Worst breakfast in my 25 years in Calgary 3 waitresses on a break while our coffees and water were sitting empties After 40 min, and a complaint about asking about our order, our waitress finally put in the order. She told us that after the fact. When the food arrived, the potatoes on my plate tasted like they had been microwaved. The pankake of one one my friend was dry. He biscuit that he requested toasted was not, etc, etc for the other 3 orders at our table. Just a sad experience."}
{"text":"The food here is great but the service sucks hands down. If you think the service here is good then you have never been properly served before because that's not service plain and simple. Waitresses need to get fired!!! So we can come back. Something seriously needs to change in this establishments customer service."}
{"text":"Red's new location is large and spacious, and staff were so welcoming when we visited on a snowy sunday. Our server was at our table with water and taking our drink order within a minute of being seated.  I had the Ramsay Benedict with prosciutto and artichoke and my bf had the stuffed French toast with goat cheese and blueberry inside. Both were large portions and my Benedict came with possibly the best hash browns in town. They are cut into bite size pieces, crispy an salted to perfection.  Even though the menu is exactly the same as the 4th street location, I felt the food was of a better quality. The service was fantastic as well.  From Wed-Sun they are open until 7:30pm an offer a dinner menu. Would love to go back to give it a try and also have a drink on their patio, when weather permits."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with great staff! They have an interesting policy not to seat your group until your entire group has arrived, but we were able to grab a cup of coffee and enjoy some sunshine while we waited. I tried the southwestern omelette and was very happy with my meal. The staff were friendly and our meals were brought out fairly fast. Would definitely try this spot again!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience!!!!   Me and my friends put our name on the No-wait app (I use this app every weekend for brunch) for brunch last Sat Dec 12th. We get to the restaurant at 10:30 and check in with the hostess. She says we are next in line and will have a table shortly. 10 minutes, 15 minutes, eventually 40 minutes later and we are still waiting for a table!!! By this point we are starving and the worst part is that we are with two pregnant ladies!! The hostess is essentially avoiding all eye contact with us, isn't explaining why she keeps sitting tables for 2 and not pushing together a table to get her table for 4 that's been waiting almost an hour!! Not offering water, coffee, or the pregnant women a piece of toast. Then, there are 2 tables of four that are have paid that are sitting and chatting and the servers are not coming by the table to offer them anything else (or even attempt to push things along!) they end up sitting casually after paying their bill for 30 minutes!!  If you've been to this restaurant you know how small it is... they knew exactly what was going on (and so did the managers on shift!) EVENTUALLY at 11:30 we force ourselves onto a small booth and the table next to us who watched the past 30 minutes happen told us they are leaving ASAP and couldn't believe what they just saw. Thy paid right away and gave us their spot.   We had a reservation at 10:30 only to be seated at 11:30 with NO apology from the hostess or manager or anybody!! I couldn't believe it!!! I would have understood (somewhat) that they are busy and we need to wait a bit, but you can ask if while we're waiting if we need water or a coffee or maybe the pregnant ladies need something but NOTHING!!!?!?   That hostess clearly had no idea what she was doing but the biggest shame is on the manager. It's a small restaurant and she saw what was going on and at no point came to our table or came up to us while we waited for an hour!! All we wanted was some acknowledgment for the mess up and an apology. I even asked our server who the manager was and I saw our server go up to her to let her know I asked and she never followed up with us."}
{"text":"I have no idea why people like this place so much. Went there for breakfast and was served the worst hash browns I've ever had, plus the sausages were raw and I was lucky not to chip a tooth on the toast. If that wasn't bad enough, the service was terrible! I seen my waitress once after being served, and it took her 5 minutes to bring hot sauce! She passed by many times without even noticing that my glass was empty, I did however noticed her sitting down and talking when she should have been working! Will never go here again!"}
{"text":"There are not nearly enough synonyms for yummy! The food is fabulous & the staff friendly and accommodating.  Personal fave is the french toast, however there is something for everyone on the menu -- just be aware, there is often a wait on weekends... and why on earth would you bother with a place that was never busy?  Busy boasts great food!!  Busy is worth the wait... and if you get bored, you can always color or have a great conversation with good friends...cheers!"}
{"text":"You have to be prepared to wait for a table, which is fine, but sometimes the wait for the food is a little too long. Nice staff, big portions and great food. One of the best places in Calgary for brunch!"}
{"text":"Vegan Tofu Scramble is the only Vegan option they have for breakfast, which is nice but nothing to write home about. Can't eat the potatoes as they are cooked in butter. Disappointing."}
{"text":"girls are great, good service and smiles, food, hot ,fresh, to much hasbrowns make the plate. my biggest concern is the parking, lot holds 12 cars, always full, nothing available being parking is zoned 4 blk radius, after 3 tickets from 5 visits,well its a very expensive place to eat. Back to the truck stop ill be going  D"}
{"text":"Usually when I go out for brunch, and this happens often, I gravitate to the eggs benedict.  For me this is the dish that I base my opinion on for brunch places. Gotta have a baseline right?    When I walked into Red's yesterday, through the snow and and cold, I was welcomed by incredibly happy waitresses and a prettty gigantic cup of coffee.  At this point I was already partially sold on the place.  Met up with two close friends for brunch and as we chatted and looked at the menu, I noticed the short rib hash with potatoes and two eggs your way.  Please note this is not my normal breakfast fair but there is a special place in my heart for anything hashed with out the word corned in it.  So of course I broke my benny rule and went hash and so did one of my friends.  When the dishes came and rather quickly I might add, all I could do was stare at it for a few seconds.  Real fall apart short ribs,  red peppers, potato cubes (the kind that's still crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), onions and then all covered in a white gravy.  Don't forget the two eggs and two slices of toast.  So just an FYI, if you are a healthy eater that watches your intake of salt, fat etc, this is not the dish for you, I suspect the salt content in this dish was off the scale but SOOO good.  Coffe cups were refilled periodically during the \"eatin time\" and \"chattin time\".  After we were done eating the place started getting crowded and we did get a bit of a hint to get going, in a friendly way.  All in the food was delicious, the toast was overkill for me and would defininately go back."}
{"text":"Half an hour wait outside? Hey, that's okay. It's a Sunday morning. I can accept that.   Half an hour for your order? Well, that's pushing it, but I suppose good things are worth the wait.   Except when they're not. My steak was ice cold and so was the toast, yet the eggs were hot -- implying some type of kitchen chaos had taken place. And the total for the two of us was over $45 -- way too expensive for the quality, and I'm from New York.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Breakfast places can break your heart. There's nothing quite like being starving, (and let's face it: Once in a while  hungover), finally getting a table, ordering breakfast with great anticipation... only to have your dream of good food dashed by soggy toast, weak coffee and hidious hollandaise sauce.  Truly.   Some one needs to make a movie about this sort of tragedy. Or at least -  a clever Youtube clip.  In any event, we rolled into Red's very hungry (no hangover) and promptly ordered. Me the bennys, B the hash.   Both were very good. I confess to being a hollandaise snob. Freely admit. So, on my hollo-meter, Red's gets an 8. Not the best I've ever had, but absolutely not the worst.   B (coffee snob) pronounced the coffee \"okay\" but I have no first hand experience there given I detest coffee. The tea was good, but that's hard to scew up.  The decor is modern and bright. I remember going to the chiropractor who used to be in this space. Clearly they dropped some bucks getting it to where it is now.  Oh and good to know: They have a parking arrangement with the Rose and Crown, so if you can't park on the side street, turn into the Rose parking lot and look for the Red's signs.  Overall, solid effort by Red's. No heartbreak here."}
{"text":"I have visited Reds on many occasions and it has always been a good experience. I really like that they have the Nowait app. That way, you aren't stuck waiting forever for a table when it's busy. The service is also always friendy and efficient. They have a good system down pat!  I've tried a few things on the menu. The salmon Eggs Benedict is probably my favorite thing I've had there. The salmon is fresh and the capers add a nice saltiness without being too overpowering. Plus that hollandaise is fantastic! Just give me a cup of that and I would be very happy. My friends both tried the Tostada and said it was delicious. I will have to try that next time!  Calgary is a great city for brunch as there are so many wonderful options. Reds is definitely a solid choice. Great food, service and atmosphere. Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time on this location. My fiance and I decided to go here so we went inside and nowhere to be found was a waitress. It was packed but no line up so we sat at an open booth. (No signs stating we had to wait to be seated) Immediately, a waitress came over and rudely told us that \"we cannot just sit ourselves\". She then told us there was an hour wait. I was so horrified at the service that we walked out and will never return. I will take Nellies any day over this waste of time."}
{"text":"Very, very average. Since moving to Calgary, we've been encouraged by several locals to try out this location.  Food: Very average. Rather flavourless in some instances. Website advertises \"farm fresh ingredients.\" Most of the items tasted like they were from a Sysco truck.  The \"huge fluffy pancakes\" were flat, heavy, and dull. $5 for a glass of juice that tasted like it came from a Tropicana jug.  Service: Weak. My husband's water sat empty for most of the meal. Server didn't even check in on us once after dropping off our food.  There are many much more fabulous places within a walking distance of Red's. It wasn't a bad experience, but wasn't anything other than passable."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Always leave stuffed to the gills. Staff are great. I've always found the service to be top shelf. The menu is straightforward, but always tasty.   My only complaint is that it's a little pricey for what it is."}
{"text":"Reds is my favorite breakfast spot.  Food is amazing.  I love the ambience, the staff, everything.!"}
{"text":"I returned to Red's Diner a couple of weeks ago after completely boycotting it when it first opened.  I know all business' have to work out the kinks when they first open up but waiting more than an hour for your food is ridiculous. Especially when it is just poutine.  Fries, Curds, Gravy, Simple.  Anyways, I decided not to hold a grudge, especially I consistently saw line-ups every weekend out their doors.  I'm glad I went back.  This time the service was impeccable, the coffee was refilled regularly, and the food was remarkably on time.  I had the gluten-free buckwheat pancakes which was a real treat, since as a Celiac I hardly ever get to have *dessert* breakfast at restaurants.  They were delicious and I honestly left feeling SO full.  My friend had a classic breakfast with bacon, eggs, & toast and said she really enjoyed it.    Red's has a really great energy to it and it is clearly apparent that they worked out whatever problems they were having in the beginning.  Great restaurant in an adorable heritage building!  B+"}
{"text":"If I'm awake before 11 and not at work, I love going to reds. Its right down the street from my home and easily accessible and affordable. I've been to Reds many times and have never been disappointed. Especially when boyfriend and I went there with a wicked hangover and they had boozy milkshakes on special. YUM. I've had everything from the granola to the mac and cheese. I cant remember what the building that houses Reds used to be, but apparently it wasn't good enough to be remembered. Way to bring a great little breakfast joint to mission!!"}
{"text":"Never a let down. If there is a line outside..it's worth the wait.  Best breakfast I've ever had. Good poutine too."}
{"text":"The eggs are always poached perfectly for me; it's tough to find a place that can poach an egg hard, and do it well and consistently. The portions are generous and the staff makes you feel like you came home. What more could you want??"}
{"text":"Went to Red's for brunch during the Stampede week, it's a very famous spot for all-day breakfast. I chose the Margarita Omelette, it was simply stunning. All in all, perfect and highly recommended. Friendly staff, but expect to wait to be seated due to the long waiting list. Bill was $80 for 4 brunch dishes + 4 coffee."}
{"text":"Overpriced, pretentious, and uninspired.  We were ignored after we sat down because we didn't see the \"wait to be seated\" sign at the eye level of someone who is 4ft. The waitress who made eye contact with us, saw us come in, and stand around confused, but instead continued her conversation also gave us the impression that we were to seat ourselves instead of waiting for their command and permission to sit. I hate dining in this city.  Eventually we had to harass someone in order to get menus. Because apparently we have to wait for their command and permission to find an authorized spot to sit at. We glance at the menus. Everything is overpriced. Nothing is unique. It's the same shit you can get from any pretentious breakfast place in calgary. I bet all the breakfast places in calgary are owned by one person, with one universal menu. And calgarians wouldn't know the difference. Or our restauranteurs are all homogenous chefs that got chased out of France. We were also delighted to see that extra maple syrup is $1.29 and salsa with your meal will cost $1.49. They were very keen to make that clear on their menus. I guess because even calgarians would stand up to that kind of bull shit. We were going to get out of that place but we had an appointment to keep. So we just ordered what seemed the least mediocre and uninspired  The woman gets the crepes with nutella and bananas. WoW sO cReAtIvE and oRiGiNaL!!! I get the oatmeal because it's the cheapest thing they have and the 13+ dorrah dishes don't quite catch me. Well, \"cheapest\" thing they have. $8.99. Her crepes were bland but the banana came out nicely. The whipped cream didn't have any creaminess to it. My oatmeal was watery and starchy. Yes, I know it's oatmeal, but this had nothing to it. It tasted instant.   The coffee also sucked. I won't waste my time with that percolated fort mcmurray well water.  Waitress came by at her leisure. Long waits for glasses of water, food ordering, the food, refills, and the bill. Come to think of it, we never had our water refilled. And it took five minutes for her to bring the initial glasses of water.  Anyways, what do I have to complain about? The bill came to *just* $26 for crepes, oatmeal, and a coffee.  Shoulda made our own breakfast. I keep asking myself why I eat out in calgary. I'm like an alcoholic gambling addict that keeps losing yet continues putting everything on 9 at the craps table. I know I'm losing and that I should cut my losses, but I get this irrational feeling that I may hit it big and have a good, delicious, and reasonably priced meal.  There isn't a good yuppie breakfast place in calgary. Pay lot less and get comparable food from Denny's and the Blackfoot Diner.  All these places should turn themselves into soul food joints. It would be more original, fun, cheaper, and fried chicken+waffles are just as unhealthy as crepes with nutellla and \"organic\" hydroponic bananas. Really. But knowing calgary, it won't be any cheaper. nevermind."}
{"text":"Reds is a great spot for breakfast, although it's busy so there early.  The servers are friendly and real - and even when it's busy they don't make you feel rushed. They are quick to top up coffee (critical for breakfast!) and make sure you have all you need. Oh and the coffee is delish.   Food is great - lots of classics like big breakfasts and pancakes as well as some unique items like short rib eggs Bennie (so so so good). Portions are more than ample, perfect for a weekend brunch. Prices aren't the cheapest but the food quality is there so you don't feel gouged.  Parking is street parking so you may have to circle a bit but it's not too bad."}
{"text":"This is a pretty great brunch place- definitely part of my top 5 favourite brunch places in Calgary. I've never had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"The menu has a great selection of breakfast and lunch items.  Quick to be seated and always great food.  The service is good but some of the servers seem a bit rushed like they might have too many tables."}
{"text":"Red's is hip; Red's is clever; Red's offers 'hair of the dog' drinks on it's menu that cater to the 'night-owl' crowd; but, Red's isn't the best on food.  I like breakfast places and I was excited to try Red's since it's the new hip place with the kids these days. I wasn't disappointed when I walked in. The atmosphere is fun and lively, the decor surprisingly open for such a tight restaurant and the service very good, so I couldn't wait to line my stomach with a big greasy diner-style breakfast.  Unfortunately, my food was on the dry side and a little tasteless (I had the pacific eggs benny with smoked salmon). It also took a long time to come out and my salmon was overcooked, the fruit sort of dry and old and the bacon was cardboard-like; not at all what I expected for such a highly regarded diner. Why Red's?!  (On a none-food related note, the bathrooms smelled like musty dishwater which was pretty gross actually.)  Red's does try hard, so I'd like to give it another chance, but perhaps for lunch next time...  T."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast which wasn't great to be honest . Steak was undercooked & tasteless and took ages to come . Refill of coffee took almost as long . maybe I'm being too harsh but it wasn't even busy! The other reds location is much better. Breakfast for 2 = $50. There's no value here in my eyes."}
{"text":"had a wonderful breakfast this morning. was my first visit after being by many times. was greeted promptly and had a water and coffee within seconds of sitting down. my hostess Kaileigh was excellent as we're the other friendly staff.  the menu all looked great and had to narrow it down to a few choices. I will be back to try the rest."}
{"text":"The new Red's in Ramsay is very nice inside, a little bit industrial with open brick walls and old oil barrel artwork. Loads of windows and lights so it is nice and bright in there.   The staff was friendly and welcoming. We had a server greet us as we walked in the door and seated instantly. We went on a wed morning so not super busy anyway.  They paid good attention to us, asking how the good was and pretty good with answering questions about the menu.   I ordered to Montreal smoked meat hash, it was tasty. The hash comes with onions, peppers, meat, bacon, two eggs and hollandaise and two slices of bread. Overall really good.   I wasn't impressed that a glass of milk was $5. You can buy a 4L jug for cheaper, might as well get a beer for breakfast. Next time I'll take a free water. This is the only negative about breakfast this morning."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the paintings. The staff is perfectly matching the atmosphere and very polite. The quality of food is very good and it's a good value. Their blueberries pancakes are delicious and perfect. I had a great experience there and I recommend this place for weekends breakfast!"}
{"text":"A popular breakfast spot for locals, Red's Diner has got it goin' on! Nice ambiance (love the exposed brick wall) and it's got this ever-so-slight rockabilly feel to it. Our extremely tattooed waitress took our order and not long after, I was in breakfast heaven. I'm a fan of their breakfast sandwiches (which they serve all day) and their scrambles are delicious. I opted out on the potato hash as I've ever been a fan of the stuff (at any restaurant). The coffee is strong, the servers are friendly and this place is great to just sit and people watch. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem.  We happened upon it on a recent trip to Calgary.  Unassuming, great breakfasts, clean @ excellent service.  Our server was Andrea--she's a rock star."}
{"text":"Brunch is ok if you can get a seat!  I had to wait for the host about 10 min, then the host showed up (I could not say if was male or female!) short with curly hair, very rude and talked really fast, like answering machine!  Tried to give me the worse seat and save other seats for others, not sure why it's called first come first serve!  Food was cold and only one girl served the entire restaurant on Sunday morning. Overall normal brunch and cold, very poor service and rude and ignorant host"}
{"text":"Red's was really good! The food was delicious and service was great. I had the Montreal Smoked Meat Hash & Eggs, a mimosa and a single-shot espresso. I don't really know what else to say about the food other than it was delicious. Can't complain about anything at all.  Service was also great. The people there always made sure I had what I wanted and were very attentive. They answered any questions that I had and were very kind. I'm not from Canada and I had a few random questions. The lady who was helping me was very cool and fun to converse with.  I loved this place. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Being a Calgary-born Vancouver transplant, I've come to expect that when I visit Calgary I'll be able to eat only what I bring with me when I'm around town - vegan food is scarce in this oil-and-beef city. So when a friend of mine who lives next door to Red's invited me for breakfast, I was skeptical. Fortunately for me and for the vegan community of Calgary, my skepticism was unfounded.  Red's offers two vegan breakfast options - a quinoa porridge and a tofu scramble. While the tofu scramble isn't quite as good as what I'd make at home, it was filling and I didn't feel cheated out of my money. The server made sure to ask whether I wanted my toast dry, which I appreciated. They also offer vegan lunch and dinner options, which I haven't tried.  The service at Red's isn't white tablecloth style - servers are a bit surly, but do their jobs well. It's a diner, so diner service and diner food (a bit greasy) are what you'll get for your money. For me, though, the food's better than anything I could get at, for example, Nelly's - where even the potatoes taste like bacon - or most other breakfast joints in Calgary.  I'm glad Red's took over that space - I'll be back twice a year, as long as they stay in business!"}
{"text":"We were kinda lost and stopped there for a quick lunch. The food was good, the service was great. Definitely will be back for dinner one day. The waitress asked if kids would be interested in a gingerbread house. I said-yes, thinking of a cookie or something  similar. But she brought a real gingerbread house kit to take home. Absolutely free! Thank you, it was great!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, Lots of choices. Awesome service!"}
{"text":"Cute diner with delicious breakfast and \"above and beyond\" friendly service. Highlights include cute \"Kraft Single-Serve table spreads\" (I had to google what you call those little packs of jam and peanut-butter). To our delight the selection included cheese-wiz. Not because I love it so much, but because it seemed ... Thorough.  I don't eat toast so I did not partake of these, but it gave me a happy feeling to see them. I did have expertly poached eggs though and enjoyed them very much. Poached eggs are the perfect litmus test of a quality kitchen.   The hash browns were well seasoned chunks of potatoey goodness, but they were NOT crisp, crunchy, McCain style frozen cubes or \"home-style\" wedges. They were delicious, but if you have a lot of preconceived notions of what a hash brown is supposed to be, maybe just get toast and load up on the complimentary preserves.   We arrived shortly after 9:00am on a Saturday and got a table straight away, but within 20 minutes people were waiting outside.   Our excellent breakfast took us all the way through to an early dinner which was less awesome and made me wish we had just gone back to Red's to try their omelettes."}
{"text":"Sunday morning, I grabbed a bite with a friend at Red's and I'm with Kate M. - this place rules!  Carrying everything from vegan options, your classic brunch specials, mac n' cheese, burgers, scramble wraps, crepes, waffles, pancakes and apple pear crumble that is served with Jack Daniel's ice cream (suddenly it's okay to ingest alcohol at 10am), Red's Diner sits in a league of its own.   Add to their diverse menu, a funky/retro decor, friendly staff and decent pricing and what do you have? A diner that is making waves in our city!  Good food, good vibe and good times. Questions anyone?"}
{"text":"As someone born and raised in Montreal; I came here for the poutine and it is by FAR th most authentic I've had in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great find! Great wait staff. Service is friendly and helpful. I had the smoked meat hash, fantastic. Large portions. Tasty coffee. Nice decor and atmosphere. Family friendly. Hipster friendly. Easy to find"}
{"text":"The food at Red's was trash -- literally.  My daughter's glass of water had a piece of paper floating in it.  Halfway through my overpriced egg sandwich, I discovered a rather large piece of melted plastic in it.  I don't know what goes on in the kitchen, but I guess I could charitably say that the kitchen staff is very careless.  The waitress deducted a whopping 10% from the cost of my egg sandwich for the plastic.  I think taking the entire cost of the egg sandwich off the bill would have been more appropriate.  Really gross."}
{"text":"We like it..nice work good service good food ..and no ego.. I will continue to eat here"}
{"text":"Great friendly fun breakfast place"}
{"text":"Restaurants with high traffic need a better flow. They sat 3 ppl at a table for 2. That may even be considered a fire hazard, as well as the concurrent crowd waiting at the entrance where there's no suitable space for this.   Besides that, food is decent. A high speed kitchen really needs experienced chefs but it doesn't seem the case. The poached eggs were a bit too soft when I order medium and the hollandaise sauce had hint of mustard.   I'll go back though... Servers are kind"}
{"text":"Trying to find a brunch place on a Sunday can be a difficult task, so going into a breakfast place that is busy for the whole morning and brunch time proves how good it is!  Nothing beats bacon in the morning, so it's important that I get some good bacon. Just crispy enough without being too crunchy. Eggs were a bit rubbery, but the home fries were quite good! Many people did seem to order milkshakes as well, so they should be quite good, though I didn't get one myself.   A decent place for a Sunday brekkie!"}
{"text":"Good service and good food.  There is often a wait and tables are quite small.  If you don't mind being a little cramped, it's a great place for brunch."}
{"text":"Robust, delicious portions, snappy, hop-to-it service, and a fun atmosphere keep me coming back to Red's. I have never been disappointed and have tried a number of their menu items.  They are happy to customize the menu items, too - hold the sauce, items on the side, etc.  They'll text you when your table becomes available to allow you to walk the neighbourhood while waiting, which I also appreciate."}
{"text":"Got the Montreal smoked meat hash. Plenty of food for a good, hearty and carby meal. The cheese bread was super tasty. Overall, the wait staff were great and accommodating even though my friend was rather late (and I was just sitting there). Definitely a place I would go back."}
{"text":"Food excellent, but don't sit at counter. You get ignored."}
{"text":"Good service. Food was bad. Ham instead of bacon on my eggs Benedict. The ham was not fresh. Food served cold. Won't be back not worth it."}
{"text":"Long time customers who become servers do a fantastic job! That was our servers story as she happily told us about the menu and delivered the food. My oldest son had the Baileys milkshake which was amazingly smooth. We had coffee (not bad) and oj which was from concentrate. The brunches were decent but not spectacular. I'm a real Eggs Benedict fan and these would receive a passing grade but the hash browns were, meh! My son did like the tofu scramble but put lots of hot sauce on it for flavor. All said, we won't rush back anytime soon but it's a decent brunch place if you're willing to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Cute nice place with extremely nice wait staff! Had huge personality and made the place feel warm :) food was well cooked and extremely well portioned! Had a great time"}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday afternoon and waited a short while before we were seated at the counter.  There are bar flies. .  Yuck.  Service was quick and attentive.    We ordered poutine, soup of the day which was vegetarian borscht, and a short rib hash.  Everything was pretty decent. The soup came with a dollop of cream or sour cream which was weird in the clear, red broth.  I scooped it out.  The poutine was good as well.  I was craving it so it was nice to finally have it. At first, I thought there wasn't enough gravy but when I was done with the fries there was still gravy left over.  The short rib hash was good as well. There is so much food!"}
{"text":"My new go to breakfast joint! I've seen it lots and never knew the epicness that it bestowed!   I originally came here, as I saw they did a fair bit gluten free, they have gluten free grilled cheese!!! It was as good as I hoped it would be. The staff is fun and friendly too.   Oh and they serve booze, which always makes brunch that much better."}
{"text":"Amazing!. Great staff and very nice cozy place! Great eggs benny too! Always busy so sometimes there is a bit of a wait but it's all worth it!!"}
{"text":"After 3 breakfast visits where 2/3 were hits, I can safely say that the egg dishes are quite good. The atmosphere is upbeat and the waitresses are star performers.   The downside? Ordered the buckwheat pancakes and was really turned off. I know how to make them delicious at home with a good blend of buckwheat flour with wholewheat and non-refined white flours to lighten them up (buckwheat by itself is heavy on flavour and texture). But when I got into these puppies, I could hardly taste the buckwheat at all. So I asked my most agreeable waitress about the proportion of buckwheat in them: after having to press her two times to get a response, I learned that the kitchen said 20%. I let it go but I'd say that they didn't have even that much. Maybe 5%. So what to do about this? I was hungry but ordered another dish, but that kinda did me in for the hotcakes cos what I do at home is just so much better.   Stay with the eggs done any way you like, and likely you will walk out totally satisfied."}
{"text":"I usually get the prairie breakfast plate and it is always DELICIOUS. I highly recommend the cheese sourdough bread because it's divine! My eggs are always perfectly cooked over easy and I've only spilled runny yolk on myself once! The girls that work here are the sweetest people I've met and I try to bring everyone I possibly can here!"}
{"text":"I would have given this a 1 star however the servers have good intentions and they also re-made the meal which they burnt with out asking...  Pro's -Location -Cleanliness  Con's -The Food.  Meal One: 3 eggs, pancake, sasusage and bacon, toast Served: 2 eggs given, pancake (no syrup) bacon was so so soft, toast...basic  Meal two: Short Rib Hash Served: Burnt, Remake was cooked better  Meal Three:  Eggs Benedict Served: with a side of toast (very odd), not very saucy  All of these were served with Hashbrowns that are like the kind you would have got back in the day at the Husky House.  I really think this place just needs time to figure out how to do the breakfast right, My advice would be to go to any other breakfast  place to do some research. They have such a special place, they need to match the breakfast to the resturant now..."}
{"text":"Excellent service and awesome food - I had fruit cup and red quinoa with soy milk (I \"creatively\" added some honey to my quiona as well;) yummy!!^.^ definitely will go there more often this summer - they extended their hr to 6pm instead of 3pm I think :)"}
{"text":"Wanted French toast So I ordered that with a side of strawberries. I got 1 strawberry cut into a few pieces and put in my French toast. The food was good and coffee was good. I've had better French toast."}
{"text":"Red's is one of my favorite restaurants in Calgary. I have, on several occasions dragged my friends to this place On mornings after late nights out. This diner has good coffee served hot with free refills which is perfect because I love to hug a hot mug of goodness while waiting for my breakfast. Red's serves good old fashioned Canadian comfort food, and I love it. I usually order the classic breakfast with two eggs, sausage, toast and hash browns. It's a huge plate with all the fixings and all for a decent price. One day, during a lovely breakfast date with my bf I discovered half of an egg shell in my scrambled eggs. I could have been a dick about it and complained but I have been there a bunch of times and knew it was a fluke. I removed the shell and continued to enjoy the feast in front of me. After we were done the server got our plates. We were waiting for the bill when the server came and said \"was that huge shell in your eggs?\" I told her that it wasn't a big deal but she said that she knows I come there a lot so she didn't charge us! This blew me away! I wasn't even mad, I didn't ask for it at all! Obviously we left a huge tip and I go back all the time. If you're worried about waiting to get in, you can download the Nowait app and get in line on your way there :) problem solved. Besides this place is worth the forethought and the wait ( if you don't have the app)."}
{"text":"If you like eggs bennies and trying your not so typical dishes,  then you have to try the caprese benny. I've had all different variations of bennies from the states and Canada but I've never seen a caprese benny before, so I decided to try it and I'm so glad I did! It was a perfect mix of sweet and savory and everything just tasted wonderful together."}
{"text":"Finding a place for breakfast isn't hard. Finding a good place for breakfast is much more difficult. Red's is a solid bet for breakfast, but it isn't without its faults.  The food is really good. There are a bunch of different bread options (go for the cheesy sourdough), the op tins are plentiful, the portions are fair and there is no reason not to like the food.   The service is OK, pretty much what you can expect in a diner, but there is certainly room for improvement. A few more smiles and a couple of more seconds not rushing away from my table would have been nice.  My real issue, though, is how hard it is to get a table. Depending on the time, it is really difficult to get a table and there isn't much room to wait anywhere without feeling like a sardine.   I say if you can get in right away, this is more than worth it, but I'm impatient and waiting simply isn't something I'm going to do when it is a small place with a big line up."}
{"text":"Red's is a diner, simply.  It makes omlettes and scrambles and oatmeal, and it does it well.   It looks neat on the inside, with a modern prairie feel, and the staff are good at what they do.   However, there's nothing special about Red's. I feel like I could get the same omlette at Humpty's for cheaper, and save myself the long line up on Saturday morning. The service has been mediocre and wait times have gone on longer than I'd hoped, but I guess that comes with starting up a new business and working out the kinks.   I would reccomend you go to Red's a few times, and try out what their menu has to offer. Their Veggie Burger is surprisingly awesome, and if you come during a lull, it's a great place to go with some friends after a late night out."}
{"text":"This breakfast spot used to be awesome but has gone down hill. I think they re-use the potatoes. So many better places to go!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  The food was ok but not anything to rage about.    This was my second times at this location and I have other places that I think I'd prefer to go.    I probably will not recommend it to people. Thr bright side is the location and the staff is very friendly.   The decor is wonderful and  warming.  Coffee has a kick.   They also have a liquor license.   I guess it's up to you if you'd like to try."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Everyone loved their food. I got the Rancheros Wrap and it was awesome. Good atmosphere and all around great spot!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Staying in downtown Calgary and ISO a vegan breakfast I found Reds on Yelp - they aren't vegan but they had a couple options.  I walked a mile to get there and i would have walked 5 miles.  The almond milk latte was delish, the tofu scramble wasn't really a scramble, more of a bruschetta... Olive oil garlic tomato spinach peppers - I got it w vegan marble rye and avocado - maybe one of the BEST breakfasts I've had, ever. Yum! Service was great, I say at the counter. This gets a surprising high recommendation!"}
{"text":"So good. Staff is great. Remembered us the second time we eat breakfast. Would recommend to friends"}
{"text":"I speak very highly of Red's Diner and typically love this place. I definitely love their little restaurant, I enjoy the decoration and vibe of the place. Every time I've been, I've had to wait for a table, so it is safe to say, I'm not the only person who likes Red's Diner.   They have one of my favorite breakfast menu's in Calgary. The choices on there are excellent, if you can't find something you like, maybe breakfast isn't for you.   I always have the eggs benedict but I usually mix it up as to which EB I have. This time around I didn't have the best experience as my order came out wrong, which is fine, but the server didn't do anything about it, so that was disappointing.   If you're looking for a cute/trendy place for a coffee or breakfast date, this is your place.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"Not much to complain about here. Nice diner off 4th street SW by Rose and Crown. Been here prob 4 times and always enjoyed the food. Decent eggs Benny.   Not sure if it's how the place was built or if I'm just usually mega hungover, but it's crazy loud in there."}
{"text":"Real homemade everything.  Eggs are rich with very orange yolks. Delicious poutine with amazing gravy.  Cozy diner atmosphere is great for meeting friends for brunch.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  Great for breakfast, brunch and brinner.  Quality food worth waiting for, and spending a little extra on.  7/10"}
{"text":"I would expect a breakfast place with a waiting line to politely inform of waiting times in a kind manner. Instead, at the door I was made to feel like a nuisance, twice.  Came in today just to check how long the waiting time was because we wanted something quick and easy and we understood this is a very busy restaurant. I was greeted by an annoyed server who I told it's no big deal if there is waiting time but we'd just rather not wait and go somewhere else! She replied rudely with 'This is Calgary hun...' She ended up saying it would be five minutes, still being quite rude and unaccommodating. So we left to find parking and when I came back I saw she was setting up the bar instead of a table for us. It was still busy so of course that was understandable. But I did ask if we could sit at the bar until a table opened up. I was told no. What kind of customer service is this? We ended up leaving.  I've been working in the industry for a long time. I've trained people to work front of house and I'm just disappointed on how I was treated today.  I wish we got to stay and eat, everything looked great from the front door but one of your staff has lost you business, she literally drove us out the door."}
{"text":"We walked here from our rental on our last morning in Calgary. The staff were super nice and helpful.   My friend ordered the mixed berry and goat cheese stuffed french toast, and I ordered the Caprese Benny. Both were pretty amazing and we left town with our bellies full and a smile on our faces. The funniest thing to me (being from the U.S) was the prescence of Cheeze Whiz with the jam and jellies.  It seemed random and comical to me but I am sure people must use it on something.  Wish I knew what :)"}
{"text":"I am a devoted connoisseur of eggs Benedict - it is my absolute favourite dish. Dare it be discovered in the menu, it will be ordered by my anticipating stomach. You could suggest a five star culinary masterpiece until the end of time - it will ultimately be refused in favour of this decadent morsel. Eggs Benedict is definitely not a 'grey area' food; prepared properly, it can be considered a king of egg dishes - prepared poorly, and it will leave you embittered against it for eternity. I am not afraid to hypothesize this theory - regardless of the risk, it will be eaten...and reviewed.  I had the traditional style of eggs Benedict (i.e. poached eggs, Hollandaise, back bacon, and English muffin). Ironically, it is called 'The Traditional' at Red's Diner. Alas, how tradition has disappointed - and here is why:  You may be aware that Hollandaise sauce is an emulsion - it is a blend of immiscible liquids. Fat, oil, and protein do not like to cooperate - if you have created this sauce, you know how dangerous mixing egg yolks and butter can be. Hollandaise requires low heat and a gentle touch - it needs to be constantly blended, or else it risks the possibility of separating. Guess what happened? It separated. It became pure, liquified butter in addition to a high viscosity residue of lord knows what. The sugar and lemon flair had been eradicated. It was absolutely disgusting. I slap a score of 0 on this sauce. Believe it or not, it is not the worst sauce. Yes...there is a Hollandaise worse than this. It received a score of -5. It was quite frightening.  I should also mention that the English muffin was too soft - it had not been toasted, or even warmed. This adds insult to the main components of the dish, because without a crisp base it absorbs liquid like a dry sponge. I do give congratulations to the back bacon, however - it was very flavourful, juicy and crisped nicely on the outside. The eggs were very nicely poached. It was cooked via a traditional method (without a poacher). The exclusion of vinegar was another bonus.  The atmosphere is quite enjoyable. It is quaint, albeit loud. The décor is not tawdry - it is trendy and modern. The customer service is quite impressive - polite staff, fairly quick service ... it does have its merits in this category.  I may return to Red's Diner, though it may be for something of more...eggs-cellent taste ;)"}
{"text":"Had a girlfriend come in from out of town so we wanted somewhere comfortable within walking distance and breakfast food was the choice.  So off to Red's we went.  They serve a spicy ceaser and it's great. Too hot for my friend so I drank hers too.  My friend had the bacon and eggs something and I had the eggs and bacon thing but with PANCAKES!!! If I never eat pancakes from anywhere else again it will be ok. I can die knowing I've had Red's pancakes. I can't tell you that a ceaser and pancakes is everyone's best breakfast but it was mine and it was amazing. The waitress was great, friendly but not trying to make a new friend which is nice and we seated ourselves at the bar but soon moved to a great little window booth which was way better. All in all it was amaze-balls"}
{"text":"Brought my dad here for his first time for breakfast and it was very good. Cute, friendly, and amazing food. I hadthe carmelized oatmeal and my dad had the traditional eggs benedict. Both were very good!"}
{"text":"Went in with a friend for brunch on a Sunday for the first time. Used the NoWait app but still had to wait extra 20 mins upon arrival and ended up sitting at the counter (we were totally fine with it). Both had tea, eggs benny (the veg one and the salmon one), and shared a caesar cocktail. I have been to lot of Brunch places in few cities and brunch here is what you'd normally expect. Nothing too special but not mediore either. A food is a bit overpriced. Crowded place. Mainly 20 to 30 yr olds. I thought the $7 caesar was good, spicy and full of flavor. Eggs benny is like any other avg eggs benny I have had. 4/5. Bill was about $60 for the 2 of us, incl 10% tip."}
{"text":"Ah, one of the best breakfast/brunch places I've ever ate at.  Hearty and fulfilling, both the stomach and the spirit.    Come early and get a seat or come late wait for a table.  It is worth the wait.  I always went alone and got a seat at the counter almost immediately.  Love it!  I think one of the servers even called me hun' at one time.  I will always go to the place where I get to be called hun'.  I recommend you get the eggs and pancakes mash up!  Fantastic!    The servers are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, over-hyped. I ordered two eggs, done over easy that came with toast, sausage, and breakfast potatoes. That alone cost $15. The eggs were not done well, runny whites, and one of the yolks was burst when it arrived. I asked for white bread and was given sourdough. The breakfast potatoes were barely room temperature. Just meh. Too expensive for so many mistakes."}
{"text":"Another super popular brunch/all day breakfast institute. They have two other locations (Kensington and Ramsay). We decided to check them out on a Saturday morning. Pro tip: download the No Wait app (second time I've used it since OEB). Seriously, the best thing ever. We only had to wait 30 minutes from start to finish. Not bad.  The inside is cozy and decor gives off an air of country home style.  - 2x Mimosas ($7.00) - if you're going to do brunch, might as well get a few mimosas. - Blueberry buttermilk buckwheat pancakes ($14.00) - had a bite of C's pancakes; they were light, fluffy and stuffed with blueberries. I should have got this for myself. - Prairie breakfast plate ($17.50) - you could tell the perogies were homemade but you only get 6 and they're small. The potato hash was good (chunky, well seasoned) and a nice touch with the fruit (orange, grapefruit and honey dew). I'm just not a \"breakfast plate\" type of guy.  Overall, decent breakfast place but a bit uninspiring and a little overpriced in my books. The lineups tell a different tale though so if you go, stick with their sweet offerings. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"After hearing many a story about Red's consistency issues, which to be fair every restaurant has, I decided to try it today.  There's still some things that need work.  The coffee was hot and strong, the water was cold and constant.  My huevos egg wrap was *spicy* (which is how I like it) and obviously used fresh black beans and jalapenos. The eggs were scrambled and fluffy and the wrap was soft and full of whole wheat goodness. The sourdough toast was perfectly browned with just a smidgen of butter. Not to mention the choice of two different hot sauces.  The hash-browns ... well, the hash-browns were as flaccid as your grandpa in his pre-viagra days. They were white, soft and brushed with paprika. Now, I usually expect hash-browns to be crunchy and browned, these were not up to par.  My companion liked her pancakes with compote although the server cautioned against getting *both* compote and maple syrup due to the cost.  I'll give Red's another shot for sure. The menu has lots of options (including vegan ones which are sadly rare along 17th/4th these days) and next time, I'll just ask for well-done hash-browns."}
{"text":"Review #28 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  So many great diners in our City, so little time.   Red's is another place that's been logged in the memory bank for quite some time.  I would forget about it, then we'd be in the area, drive by and suddenly be reminded we must try out this Diner.  Plus it's not hard to miss the obvious Rooster signage as you go by.  Opportunities lately have allowed hubs & I to sneak out for date lunches more often than ever before.  Our lunch at Red's was one of those golden opportunities while the kids were at school.  We were able to walk in and be seated immediately.  I love the warm & inviting decor inside and the immediate friendless of the staff.  As soon as I saw the Prairie Breakfast Plate on the menu I knew I had to have it since it offered perogies as part of the meal.  Hubs decided to stick with lunch and ordered the Chicken Club Sandwich with fries & gravy.  I love a Diner where you can order a special coffee drink and so I hastily or maybe happily ordered my regular (cappuccino).  It was delicious.  Our lunch arrived rather quickly and we got to work vowing to share bites.  Well hubs is a creature of habit and always starts with his fries & gravy.  So I had to jump in and sample before they were all gone.  I have to shout out how yummy the home made gravy (with some sort of vino in it) was.  The fries were crispy and tasty.  His Chicken Club was made the way a Chicken Club should be...with chicken breast (instead of sliced deli meat).  It was large and he says one of the best he's had in years.  I started on my poached eggs which were cooked to perfection.  The Kielbasa was scrumptious but I gave most of it to hubs since it was a lot of food for me and he has that darn wooden leg.  The perogies were everything a perogy should be...not over stuffed, cooked properly and mighty good.  We left feeling full and satisfied.  I have to give this place 5 stars because they met every expectation and then some."}
{"text":"Ate here two days in a row on our trip to Calgary. Great food, excellent service! Had a good range of gluten free options."}
{"text":"A safe choice for brunch, any time of the year! The place is spacious, so bigger groups have a decent chance on weekends for brunch, the service and food were both pretty good. I like!"}
{"text":"Went for a quick mid week lunch alone. Had the classic grilled cheese with fries and a cuppa tea.  The fries were homemade, thick cut, skin on, nicely seasoned, but so hot my mouth is burned the next day. Yummy, high quality food, great service. I sat at the counter looking into the kitchen, and thoroughly enjoyed my carbs."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in Calgary. They have an authentic menu and a great brunch environment. Specially their pancakes and Ranchero sandwiches are super delicious. Most importantly their service is the best as some of the coolest people manage this diner."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Red's Diner yet, but have been following some of the mixed reviews here on Yelp. When Chris P chose this joint for a mid-week brunch UYE (unofficial Yelp event), I was ready to soak it in like whipped butter and maple syrup on a fresh waffle.  Red's looks like it would have some sketch to it based on the outside. The insides so don't match the exterior building. Modern and fresh, this diner is clean and new with warm colours and fun decor.  There were only three of us, but we sat in this awesomely big booth at the back. After a quick look at the menu, I settled on the Farmer's Eggs Benny and a coffee. That was a good way to start off a Thursday! I swear the toast the eggs were served on had been soaked in butter prior to having the sauce and eggs put on top. It was full-on flavour all the way through.   Near the end of our breaky, our server was headed out back for a break. She stopped by the table to say good-bye in case she missed us before she came back inside. Cute! She actually didn't miss us, and so we got an extra thank you and good-day. Extra props right there!"}
{"text":"T'was ok. Offers some vegetarian items. My tofu scramble was pretty good."}
{"text":"Adding to my review, had Anniversary breakfast and had Crepes la québécois! Did not like very much some bites were a like off balance sour apples or cheese flavour not great, but Shea our server was fantastic!! She took 10% off bill after I mentioned it, she offered a new meal first but it's not their fault I don't like it!! And my hubby had Montreal hash it was great! Coffee a little strong but love it here and love Shea our server!!  Ate there today, and it was hands down great!! Better than Red's in Ramsay! For some reason 4th seasons potatoes where as Ramsay does not!! 1thing I had different was no toast and had pancake, fantastic! And my server was excellent and friendly! Reason for only 4 star is coffee I didn't order one but I went by the previous time and didn't like it but I like my coffee pretty strong! My favourite spot!!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review of Red's Diner on 4th street - as I've visited this little joint more than I've seen my parents, over the last 6 months. Just to clarify on a few of the standard tips/questions regarding parking, wheelchair accessibility, and liquor licensing. 1) They don't have a FULL bar, but they serve more than beer & wine 2) There is a step, and the doorway is narrow, so depending on the size & style of the wheelchair, access with assistance is possible 3) There are reserved parking spots on 15th ave, attached to the lot of the Rose & Crown. On the south side of the road, right next to the sidewalk - these three spots are marked for Red's Diner  I remain aligned with my first review, but after more flirting with the menu and a few cool clientele experiences I have even more great things to say about Red's. I'll just get a few food glitches out of the way first -- I think they make hollandaise from scratch, it's way too buttery & salty - the consistency is all wrong. I don't mind if you use a package from the store, I'd rather have nice sauce on my bennies. If you do get the bennies, ask for your sauce on the side. Second food issue - Poutine get's 1 star. I know Poutine. I dream of it, I crave it, and I know the good & the bad. Could've been an off day - but the dish I had was soggy fries, runny & salty gravy, and mini-lumps of mozzarella. mozzarella!!  On to the good stuff! After being open for 9 months, I'm surprised there hasn't been more staff turnover.  I can't speak for BOH or Kitchen, but the same friendly girls at the front have been there since Day 1. They're not silver service, and that's fine by me. Solid serving staff, they uphold the brand well.  This is great breakfast food, with an even better atmosphere. **My current go-to brekkie - buckwheat pancakes with a side of honey yogurt. 5 stars.  KLM"}
{"text":"Good for a diner experience. You get all the standard stuff - eggs, pancakes, healthier options etc. good size in portions. Very friendly staff. Can get crowded quickly and would be tough for a family to fnd a spot. Not one for a chillax experience but great if you want a diner fix"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! I feel like I'm so stuffed from the food when I exit the premises, leaving me ready for nap time. ZzzzZzzz, Kam go night night.  The waitresses are full of energy, never had a bad experience given the number of customers they serve on a busy Saturday afternoon. I like to keep my meal consistent because it never lets me down; Traditional Eggs Benny poached medium, and a pancake on the side for that sawweet burst of flavor! In my opinion, the finest poached eggs in the city. They do em just right!  So if you decide to stumble upon this place, be sure to have your yelp app ready on your phone before you go to... ZZZzzzzZzzz.  Okay, it's nap time now."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes are first-class. The batter is fluffy and the blueberries are almost \"pie filling\" like. Even if you decide on another menu item, order one as a side for the table to share. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"For awhile, I was starting to be okay with Red's. We were coming to terms with each other and I started to accept that dining there simply meant dining in mediocracy. However, reflecting upon my last visit, I would like to offer a little advice to those imploring the possibility of dining at Red's Diner:  1. The veggie burger is not actually vegan. On one visit to Red's, I inquired as to whether or not the \"homemade\" veggie burger was suitable for vegans. The waitress wandered back to the kitchen and confirmed yes, it supposedly contained no dairy or egg products. I instead ended up going with a giant salad, and I'm glad I did, because the last time I visited Red's, I was told by the server that no, the veggie burger was not vegan. In fact, it is not even homemade. This is a \"typo\" on the menu- the guac is actually homemade and the veggie burger is one of those crummy Garden Burger patties.   2. Do not order the red quinoa unless you want to starve.  I expected that for $12, this would be quite a hearty option. However, what I received was a slightly large coffee mug full of undercooked quinoa and nuts, with some soy milk on the side. I could buy pounds of quinoa for this price and cook it proper at home. This was also the only oatmeal-ish option that came without toast or fruit on the side, yet was also the most expensive.   3. If you order a large class of juice, you will be paying $6 for fucking Sunrype. Enough said.   4. If splitting your bill, do not let your server do the math for you unless you want to be charged $21 for your $12 bowl of shitty quinoa and a cup of coffee.  I hope that I for reeeal won't be back here next time. Ugh."}
{"text":"If it were up to me, I'd be renaming Red's Diner to Beige.  I gave this place a few chances before I wrote a review because I really want to like it. They have gluten-free crepes, all kinds of eggs and have a great location. What more could anyone ask for?  Tragically, Red's isn't getting the basics right.   - It's a diner, people want speed. Every time I've been, the service is painfully slow, the food takes for ever and there's a bunch of people (that appear to be employees) standing around. I am easily annoyed when I am hungry and making me wait 45 minutes for eggs will not improve this.   - It's a diner, people want good coffee. Especially on weekends when they are probably hung over.   - It's a diner, if you're going to serve basics, make sure they are done really well!  Hope they figure a few things out as they get older."}
{"text":"We are here visiting from Vancouver and we had heard from friends how great this diner was and we were not disappointed, We had an excellent server I believe her name was Ally. She was very friendly and patient as she guided us through the selections on the menu and helped us make the right decisions as of what to choose. We received our food very quickly and it was excellent the coffee was awesome! I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Their food is great... if you can get a table.  Go early and you won't have to wait as long.  Arrive on Sunday at around 11 or noon and expect to wait 20~30min.   Their front entrance is tiny so you'll have to squeeze in or wait outside.  Once they were ignoring people waiting so we just went next door and had a great brunch at the Rose & Crown.  Their coffee is good and their eggs Benedict is one of the best in the city.   Worth the wait most days!"}
{"text":"I've been to Red's Diner twice since I've moved downtown in June...this Sunday will be my third...although if I were more of a breakfast eater I would be here probably once a week, as I live less than a 5 minute walk away!    Both visits I had the traditional Farmhouse Eggs Benedict and they were delicious.  I'm guilty of being a salty food addict, and this dish does not disappoint if you happen to be one too.  It's very rich with the Hollandaise, butter, and Canadian bacon...so it's quite a treat (and hangover cure!) and if you're watching your carbs, probably not the dish for you (at least not on a regular basis).  The hashbrowns, as others had mentioned, were limp and undercooked...I'll have to ask for them to be more well-done next visit.  The Lattes I had were frothy and tasty.  I brought my very picky niece with me on one visit, and she had the Buttermilk Buckwheat Pancakes and fruit bowl...both of which she barely ate as she was busy coloring with the placemat and crayons the waitress had sweetly provided.  I ate one of her pancakes and found it a bit dry...but I am not really a pancake fan and don't drench them in syrup or anything similar, so it was probably just the way I chose to eat it.  The waitress put the fruit bowl in a little recycled cardboard carton and gave us a biodegradable wooden cutlery set, which I thought was a really nice and appreciated touch.  The service was decent both times...waitstaff were friendly and pleasant.  Food came out pretty quickly.  On my most recent visit, I was excruciatingly hungover and the bill took forever...torture!  It's a bit loud in there too, and snug, so don't come here expecting to have an intimate conversation or a peaceful read of the morning paper.  All in all, I enjoyed the meals and the ambiance and am looking forward to another visit here next week!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this diner, definitely one of my favorites! Great coffee. The food is quite heavy though, and hash browns are greasy and not the tasty-est. Always feel like falling asleep after eating their breakfasts (not ideal before work but great for a weekend hangover cure!) a few more lighter options/gluten free options/ etc would be good.   Fantastic service & lots of character. A must try. Haven't been to their new location in Kensington yet but it is on my list!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean diner venue! love the brick wall, love the tight seating! just like any other diner in the east coast! This venue go through a lot of facelift, you can feel it!  Service was good.    Food is not bad, could be better.   I ordered an egg benedict, comes with 2 eggs, 2 thin sliced of canadian bacon (ham?) with English muffin, with side of potato wedge, 2 slice of fruit and 2 slice of toast.  Okay, it's way too much carbs here, I mean I already had an English muffin with the egg benedict and the side potato, it would better if they can cut a thicker slice of meat or one more slice of meat, instead of more toast.. But one thing I should mention about the toast, it's not like they are using some cheap bread, like wonderbread or whatever, it's obvious that the bread is quality stuff, my friend thinks it's from Manual Lutruwe, good stuff!!"}
{"text":"Very good place, compared with (what I presume) it's neighborhood rival The Beltliner it's a bit more 'old school' and diner-like which is great.  Depending on mood, either are an excellent breakfast option in the area.  Got there before 10 a.m. on a Sunday, which seemed to be the sweet spot as there were a few tables ready to go for two, but on the way out there was a big line so caution on coming hungry at 10:15 because you'll just be birdwatching other people chow down on hefty plates of goodness.  Got the Big Red's Breakfast, great deal for $17.50 CAD.  Everything on the plate was as expected (breakfast potatoes, eggs, bacon, sausage), with the exception of the pancake - wow!  It was memorable, great taste and they syrup is perfect."}
{"text":"Was looking for a nice breakfast spot and Red's filled the spot! We ordered the Montreal Beef and Hash and it was very good! The meal was enough for two so for the price, I believe the portions are about right. Very nice place to enjoy breakfast."}
