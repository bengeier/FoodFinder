{"text":"We were looking for a quick lunch on our road trip. Found this place with good reviews and price. Authentic Mexican food. I had the chicken and steak chimichangas. My husband have the lengua and steak tacos. Delicious! Love the salsa. Nice and friendly staff. We will probably stop in on the way back."}
{"text":"I think Taqueria Sabor Queretano is just delicious. The guacamole is some of the best I've ever had, and (as mentioned elsewhere) the portions are HUGE. I had an asada gordita, carnitas taco, and chorizo taco - everything was excellent. My only complaint is that they were out of al pastor when we came, but I'll definitely be back to check that out. I've got a longer review on my taco-reviewing website, here: http://tacosmog.com/rev/t/taqueriasaborqueretano.html"}
{"text":"Great food.  Mas(s) quantities.  Spanish-speaking soaps on TV.  You get the picture - totally awesome."}
{"text":"OK, I love this place. The food is fantastic. Very authentic mexican. The tacos are large and very flavorful. The carnitas was a bit on the fatty side but that's the way I like them.  What was really surprising was the steak platter. It has the usual thinly sliced bisteak, rice and beans but also includes fried plantains which are delicious. I usually get three meals out of this dish.  The inside isn't what I would call fine dining but if you're looking for a great \"order at the counter\" Mexican dinner than this place more than satisfies."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a bite to eat. I have done their Tacos Especial the last few times I have been and now I bring friends. The atmosphere is fine, the service is prompt and the price is fair.  It's worth going here for great Mexican food. Feels very authentic."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Madison, hands down. The guacamole and chips is also outlandishly delicious- they make the chips fresh and they come hot. Get tacos al pastor."}
{"text":"They have great authentic Mexican food. Their burritos are larger than your head, and will feed you for a week. Their guac is outstanding, and you have to get the plantains. Yum!"}
{"text":"Got the enchiladas verde from the food truck. Yes, the food was good, but holy hell it was spicy! Like I stopped eating 20 minutes ago and my mouth is still on fire. And there was no warning that it would be that spicy. If they had given me a heads up, they probably would have gotten 5 stars."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp, I have never reviewed a place before and had to sign up for an account to review. I had the Honduran Carne Assada, it was prefect, the plantain was ripe, sweet and perfectly prepared. This is like getting real central American street food than fancy but perfect. We had guacamole that was obviously prepared after we ordered it, very fresh. My friend had a burrito that was delicious.  Don't go if you want fancy but do go for the great food."}
{"text":"Most authentic mexican in Madison.  Amazing food.  The tamales Mexicanos are homemade and filled with chicken and jalape√±o.  The chorizo tacos were the best tacos we've eaten...ever!  Their guacamole is super fresh.  When we ordered a soda, it came in a can.  It definitely wasn't enough to quench my thirst, especially with the spicy tamales.  A couple people were eating the menudo.  I haven't been able to pull the trigger on that yet but, if I was going to try it, this would be the place.  Maybe I'll get the courage next time."}
{"text":"Great food,  so flavorful, love the authenticity!   Portions are huge,  you won't go away hungry! Chorizo tacos were fabulous, we will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food, reasonable prices for the portions. This is not Texmex food. Real stone ground yellow corn tortillas. Fresh handmade guacamole. Had the carne' asada which came with grilled plantains, rice, beans (not refried), and salad with avocado, and fresh made green salsa. The salsa was in a small container, but a little went a long way. Friendly service. I ate there two lunches in a row and it would have been more if I was in town longer. My wife had the chimichanga which were huge and filled with lots of meat. She finished 3/4 of one of the two included with the order. This is the real deal Mexican food with Mexican TV on in the background. This is not a place to go for your brightly colored typical Americanized Mexican decor, but a great place for great food."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way through town and are so glad we did! Enchiladas verdes and steak chimichanga were extremely delicious!!  I can't wait to recommend this place to friends in Madison!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I am from Chicago so I grew up with authentic Mexican food and it can be quite hard to find where I live in Florida . I was in Wisconsin and stayed next door to this restaurant and looked on yelp and it seems to be the real deal. Our bill did get a little higher than I expected but the food was wonderful. I tried steak, chorizo (greasy but tasty), and barbacoa tacos. We were the only patrons in there for a little while, and our server was wonderful to us. He was very attentive and very friendly and just great. I think the owner cooked the food and it was very quick. A few people came in later and judging from their accents I think they were Mexican, which makes me very happy because I know I was surrounded by people who appreciated the restaurant's food. Sadly, this restaurant is very far from me in Wisconsin but if I ever end up in the area again I will definitely be there as soon as I land"}
{"text":"Have eaten twice from their food truck!  Great, authentic Mexican food!!!  The woman taking orders is so friendly and so is the cook.  The guacamole is the best ever and so fresh!!  Quantities are HUGE!!"}
{"text":"The food was really good. As close to authentic you're going to get in Madison, WI. The only downside are the prices. They are really expensive. The sopes are the bomb! So so so good. If you're looking for authentic, this is the place to go. Order a carne asada sope and a bottled Jarritos or a bottled Coke. Oh and PS the burritos are HUGE!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to Yelp!  Go Yelp!  These two guys are the real deal.  Making great Mexican food and taking care of business.  The portions are huge and the meats are outstanding.  I had two tacos and they were both wonderful (carne asada and al pastor).  We had the fresh guacamole and it was so good.  Coke comes in bottles.  Still have the World Cup brackets posted with Alemania winning it all.  (Mexico, maybe next time?)  It is very close to the big mall, and a much better choice.  It's back from the main road, in a strip mall behind the frontage businesses.  Way worth the stop!"}
{"text":"So good President Trump would build a wall around it. Beef taco was good, chicken taco was so-so. Honduran carne asada was really good."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. I had the beef carnitas and a beer, the daughter had steak chimichangas and water.  The meal came in about 10 minutes and they give you quite a bit of food.  Everything was fresh. My steak was on the chewy side but flavorful.   The reason for just 3 stars is  1. No chips and salsa.  Really! !  So you just have to sit there and wait.   2. Price.  $30 for 2 lunches?   And the daughter had water?  Good food but at the price there are other pl a case for me."}
{"text":"Just passing through town and feeling hungry we happened to stumble upon La Taquiera Hispana.  Delicious tacos and flautas.  If you live in Madison, don't pass this place up.  Don't let the outside appearance or location put you off.  Step inside, grab a table, and prepare your tastebuds to be delighted.  Service is quick and friendly.  A great option for those of us who always try to eat \"local\"."}
{"text":"Don't go anywhere else in town for traditional Mexican fare....it won't compare!"}
{"text":"The beef burrito, truly the size of Lovely Wife's head, went perfectly with a smoky salsa roja and a Negra Modelo.   But the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde were absolutely fantastic! Even the beans and rice, traditional sides, were fresh and flavorful. We will come here again, without fail!"}
{"text":"I got the \"mojarra mexicana\" today. Best Fish (catfish, deep fried with no batter) ever. Comes with the head."}
{"text":"I have been to this simple establishment twice and have enjoyed my food immensely.  Speaking of immense, the last time I went, my partner and I split a chicken burrito. We asked for the rice to be served outside the burrito. The waited suggested we have some guacamole inside so we agreed to give it a try. This was one hell of a burrito. Thank goodness we only ordered one. It was huge. However, we thought it was delicious, well-seasoned and oh so moist. We were very happy that we had the rice on the side.  I think the burrito would have been way too heavy had it been inside. The beans inside were creamy and the guacamole added some tang from the lime overtones. It was the best burrito I ever ate.  I drank a Tamarind Jaritos... so yummy!  The ambience is just plain old, plain old. Really there is no ambience but the restaurant is very clean, service is good and the food excellent.   A little further down the strip is La Michoacana which is a Mexican ice cream purveyor. The perfect dessert!  FYI- there is a Weight Watcher office pretty close by too. Be sure to steer clear."}
{"text":"Former La Taqueria Hispana Food was okay. It was not the best l've ever had. serving size is 5 star; however chicken brrito was $10. So, for the price I say it was about right. I would rather go to Chipotle in the next block and pay 75% less for 75% less amount of food. There is not a possible way I can eat the whole thing anyway. Chicken was stewed not grilled. I prefer grilled. My other dislike was the ingredients are really not distibuted evenly, so one end had mostly rice then other end was mostly chicken.  My husband had tacos and he said pastor was bit dry but okay. Carne asada was good."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious food! Small and unassuming, this restaurant delivers BIG in flavor and value! We started with chips and salsa, which is always a risk. Will the chips be stale? Straight from a bag? Not here--these were fresh and crisp. They were served with two bottles of hot salsa, one salsa verde and one rojo. They were so flavorful and had a great kick! I ordered two tacos (steak and pork) with sides of rice and beans. The tacos were giant and the meat was so flavorful. I particularly enjoyed the pork! The rice and beans were not your average run of the mill; they were so much better. They both had distinct flavors and were a great addition to the meal!   I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place is truly worth a stop. Bare bones decor but is the food excellent! Friendly staff and many options on the menu. Authentic and worth finding!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for what seems to be authentic Mexican food, this place might be for you. If you like monstrous servings of food, this might also be the place for you.   For me, authenticity can take a back seat to food I enjoy and an inviting restaurant atmosphere. I found the food mostly one-dimensional and tons of food I don't care for isn't a bonus.  Where to start?  Chips and salsa? Hmmm, a separate order here unlike the complimentary ones at some places. Then I watched the guy open a bag of corn chips I know I can buy at Woodmans and then dumped them in the bowl. Not a good sign. Fried on-site and served warm is a nice touch to a simple appetizer. The salsa came in old-school grubby looking ketchup and mustard bottles with the nozzles sawed off to facilitate squirting. The salsa verde seemed ok. The red sauce was mostly smoke, heat, and salt. Maybe perfectly traditional but a chunkier salsa with fresh cilantro, onion, and more lime juice is more up my alley.  My friend had a monstrous burrito, chock full of dry, flavorless chicken, a splash of rice, a bit of cheese, and some mashed pinto beans. Too much of nothing special. This could easily feed two people if you want to try the place out on the cheap.  I had shrimp diablo or something. The huge shrimp were tough from overcooking and drowned in too much smokey sauce. On the side was shredded iceberg lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and a scant few carvings from an avocado. Boring stuff. A pile of Spanish fluffy rice on the side could have helped with the over-sauced shrimp but a few withered peas and kernels of greasy corn isn't near enough to rescue a one-dimensional dish of too much food. I even squeezed every last drop of lime out of the wedges on the plate, hoping to add some dimension and freshness, but it was to no avail.  The restaurant itself seemed clean but not a welcoming place to eat. You probably wouldn't care though if you like the food and/or the portion sizes.  A good margarita may have improved my opinion of the place but they can only sell beer, apparently.  Me, not planning to go back. The place may be perfectly fine if you prefer authenticity but it's not for me."}
{"text":"This review is for 1 taco from their food truck at Breese.  Well priced and tasty, but I wasnt given a lime...."}
{"text":"Great food, average Mexican dive style restaurant. Staff is friendly, service is fair on the speed index"}
{"text":"I thought it was good but the fried chicken was not as good as regular chicken in the torta. It was clean and food was good. Great portions. They wouldn't entertain my broken Spanish though."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, so I have been looking for a decent taco joint up here in Madison.   Today, I found an acceptable establishment.   The taco pastor was superbly delicious and well stuffed.   I've found that different people like their horchata different ways, but for me, this may be my favorite horchata yet! Not very cinnamony, and creamy without being too terribly sweet.   Taco + horchata + tax left me at a total bill of $5.26, so no complaints there, either."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Madison, my wife and I found Taqueria through our \"friends\" on Yelp.  This place is literally located in a random strip center off the frontage road, behind a McDonald's.  It is a bit sketchy feeling - in fact, my wife and I debated going here or doing the safe thing and hitting the Chipotle down the block.  SO GLAD we went here.  It is a medium sized Mexican joint with authentic food and great service.  The waiters were great, kind, and quick to help with any needs.  When we sat down, they brought chips and two kinds of salsas - I LOVE spicy foods and rarely do they affect me, but the hotter salsa had a nice kick and great flavor.    The food we ordered definitely shined. I ordered Tripe tacos (get over the fear - tripe is awesome).  These were outstanding!!!  I also ordered the Al Pastor Sope - these were bigger than expected and also excellent.  While I didn't order a burrito, I saw one being delivered - it looked like it weighted 5 pounds...  If and when we go back, I will certainly stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Wow. Texas is on notice with this cozy little spot in Madison Wisconsin.   I ordered 3 shredded chicken tacos with queso blanco, pico, and cilantro. Now. When I say \"taco\", I guess that translates to the owners as mini burritos because these things were monstrous!!! They come on deliciously delicate corn tortillas that were soft and flavorful.   I don't know what was in their salsa, but it was knock your socks off flavorful, slightly spicy and smoky sweet.   Wash them down with a Pacifico cerveza and you would think I was back home in Houston!!!"}
{"text":"This taqueria has so many home cooked touches.  The guacamole was quickly made to order.  The shredded pork in the tacos was slow cooked and tender.  The salsas were deep in flavor and contained fresh cilantro and chiles.  The pastor and chorizo were clearly house-made and richly prepared.  The ambiance is like so many of these great Mexican places.  Clearly not the comfort that you expect from more expensive restaurants.  It's the decor of a sandwich shop but the cuisine of great heights."}
{"text":"They prepare your food fresh as you order it. Takes a while but it is worth it. I tried the pork, the chorizo, and the chicken. My favorite was the chorizo although they were all great.  The guacamole was good but not great. They serve beer and wine and they have  A good selection of bottled fruit soft drink beverages. They aren't overly friendly but they are efficient. Nothing fancy here just good food."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to have taken the place of La Taqueria Hispana. I was really disappointed. Deep fried plantains were just greasy. The rest of my meal was totally unseasoned. The good salsa wasn't enough to make up for the lack of flavor in everything else. So sad."}
{"text":"Really, my favorite cheese enchiladas I've ever ordered! Amazing beautiful plates with avocados and vegetables and great, strong flavors. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, large quantities, wonderful flavor. Don't miss this place if you want authentic Mexican flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food, but this place was REALLY good! Food was fresh & seasoned well, & the server was quick & very nice! It's a local spot & had a steady stream of ppl. Give it a try! U WON'T be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We had really high expectations for this place. We were really hungry coming home from the Brewers Opening Day game. Tradition for us is to grab some burritos after the game. We decided to try a place we've never been before...  The reviews of this place were amazing! We both ordered a burrito. OMGoodness!! This is like the  Godzilla of burritos. It was massive to say the least.   I gave this place 3-stars for quantity. I think I'll get three meals easy out of this. I also gave it 3-stars for friendliness. The person who took our order was super friendly and helpful. He did not treat us bad for being the weird gringos who don't speak much Spanish.   However, we found the burritos to lack flavor. I don't think there were any spices on it. I like a burrito with a little kick. I got the steak burrito and my husband got the chicken. The burrito was not lacking in meat. It had so much meat. Usually places use it sparingly...this was not the case! It almost had too much meat! Also, if you like cheese please note these do not come with cheese.   We really wanted to like this place. We are having a hard time finding a decent Mexican place, but sadly this just wasn't it."}
{"text":"Downgraded review after finding several rocks in my pinto beans. Told waiter and he did nothing. He did not appear to notify cook. He did not take it off the bill, nor did he apologize. For the those who don't know, a rock in pintos indicates poor food prep, and can lead to a cracked tooth. Boooooo.  This is a real shame because otherwise, I have loved every dish and every visit to Sabor Queretano."}
{"text":"I'm sure my bad experience with the tacos left me with great disappointment. I did not try the burritos here but what I saw people carry out were ginormous in size. I was severely let down by the over salted taco meat here. My advice is to skip the tacos and go for the burritos and the chimichanga. The Carne Asada plate my brother had wasn't that great either, it was just a lot of food on the plate with plantains with very little to no flavor at all.  If you're looking for tacos go to Mercado Juarez, if you want burritos then this is probably where you want to be."}
{"text":"Average food, average service, average prices. Nothing to complain about, just nothing to make it stand out from the many other taquerias."}
{"text":"Interesing dishes and flavors.  Decent prices and excellent service.  Not sure this is mexican, doesn't taste like anything I've had before."}
{"text":"Decent place within walking distance of the Crowne Plaza hotel.  I had a pork and steak taco.  Good size and the food tasted fine.  Nice hot sauces.  Too much cilantro, which seems to be the norm everywhere.  I swear cilantro has replaced marijuana as the national weed of Mexico."}
{"text":"Ordered plantains, gordita, and tacos especial. I am a vegetarian so I asked if they could make them with beans instead of meat and they obliged.   My favorite Mexican restaurants are Taqueria Guadalajara and El Poblano--Sable Queretano fits in with the best of the bunch.   I love how they use crema on the plantains and the taco especial--the gordita shell was super fresh, thin, and delicious.  Same with corn tortillas--not sure if they make tortillas in house but they were very delicious.   Try it!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The portions are huge and fresh!  Everything is made to order including the guacamole.  The fresh tamales at their food cart is what brought me to the restaurant.   I tried the guaraches.  It appears to be something like an open faced burrito.  The base is more like a flat tamale. It's a big round flat sheet of Masa.  It is then topped with refried beans, meat, lettuce, tomato, and some sort of sour cream I think.  I couldn't decide if it was sour cream or mayonnaise and it was probably a combination of both. Whatever it was it was good.  The burrito was huge and stuffed full of all the good stuff.  They have bottled beer, soda, water, and Horchata.  I didn't notice the Horchata right away or I would've ordered that instead.  Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"This likely is the best Mexican food in Madison. Super authentic, great prices and friendly staff. Try the pambazo sandwich, it is spicy and overall ridiculously good. It is a large sandwich filled with chorizo and potato and dipped in a spicy guajillo pepper sauce. I recommend their chorizo if you enjoy spicy food! If spice is not your thing their carnitas is excellent and flavorful. Their guacamole is quite nice as well! Give this hole in the wall a chance if you love excellent, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Stopped by before starting on my usual pilgrimage up I94. Place is pretty hard to find because it is hidden behind a McDonald, but I was happy I put in the effort.  I had 3 tacos: pastor, barbaco and carnitas. All were good and came with perfect sauces, but what I liked most where the tortillas. They were the more rustic kind and looked like they might have been homemade with stone ground flour. It is a small thing, but I thing it is this sort of things that makes a taco joint stand out.  I also liked the vibe of the place. Laid back, mostly South American patrons and a prompt, no frill kind of service. Oh And the World Cup on TV.  Will probably stop by again for a quick bite on my way from or to I94 and maybe get something more portable to eat while on the road."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My boyfriend used to live in Texas and he said that it was the best Mexican food he's had at a restaurant since moving to New York.   I had the chimichanga and he had the flautas. Both were amazing and the salsa was very spicy and delicious. I wish this place was in Syracuse instead of Madison, WI."}
{"text":"Tucked away behind a bridal store and tuxedo rental shop in a little Mexican themed strip mall on the East Side of Madison, is a wonderfully authentic Mexican restaurant called Taqueria Sabor Queretano. They just got a new printed menu today, my first time trying this business out.  My husband and I ordered the menudo soup and lengua taco. I ordered a horchata drink - think Big Gulp sized! ($3).  My lengua taco was $2, and it was actually big enough to make into two tacos with the double tortillas we received.  The menudo soup is also a hearty portion size - we had to ask for the \"small\" size ($7), otherwise, it would have been large enough to feed at least two, likely three people.   The service provided by our waiter, Mario, was good. I think Mario was the only waiter in the shop who speaks English - the owner/chef seemed to rely upon him for translation when I'd asked how long they had been open.  He said three years now. Wow, that's a long time to be open and not yet have a yelp review.   All the customers who walked in were from the neighborhood.  I will definitely be coming back here again - food was great. Ambience was decent - a flat screen TV plays telenovelas in the background, a huge fan to cool us down from the heat of the food, and cases and cases of jarritos piled high up against the walls for storage.  But everything was clean, people were friendly, and the food was seemingly authentic.  there's a grocery store next door - La Hispana - that sells limited produce, household things, rotisserie chicken, boxed horchata, etc."}
{"text":"Still my favorite, but quick little tip/update: They have horchata behind the counter. It's not on the menu. Ask for it. ¬°Es excelente!"}
{"text":"yo, now this is whuts up!!!  i spent the last 10 years in nyc, living in queens where taco trucks were a plenty and a favorite late night post bar 4am put on harold and kumar and toke a lil' sumpin' sumpin' snack was chorizo, bistek, or carnitas tacos and a manzana soda!!!  i'm fond of all the different foods in madtown but i missed my taco truck then i found this place!!!  yo, the tastes are delicious the meat portions sizes are HUMUNGOUS!!! this is it for my east side taco joint  they pack each taco with so much meat, your head will explode in pleasure! each taco with set you back about $2.50 but for the portions, it's really like 2 tacos!!!  super nice people quick service very clean  highly recommended!  ps i stopped in for lunch today saw some dudes putting away a huge slab of meat and soup and tortillas that's my next meal!!!"}
{"text":"You would never find this place unless you go looking for it.  And you should go look for it.  It's in a small strip mall behind the McDonalds on E. Wash.  We came here on a Friday night and shared two dishes - we ordered the chicken burrito and 2 chorizo tacos.  We also ordered the guacamole.  The chorizo tacos were very good - chorizo can be greasy, but these were not.  Great flavor with fresh avocado and cilantro.  The burrito was very good too - the shredded chicken was super moist.  The guacamole was also very good - but the chips seemed like they were not so fresh.  They actually weren't even chips - they were full sized tortillas which you broke up to use as chips.  Also there was no salsa?  That was a bit odd - I know chips and salsa are a HUGE reason I go for Mexican food - they are my guilty pleasure.  I'll definitely be back though."}
{"text":"Fianc√© and I stopped here last night based on the amazing Yelp reviews and was not disappointed! Guacamole was made fresh to our order, huge portions, retro glass coca cola bottles. Loved everything... But, no margaritas :( but no worries the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Came here on yelp reviews. Very unassuming, but the tacos are huge and delicious. We got the especial pork, chicken and chorizo with a side of rice and beans. The rice was so fresh and fluffy and the meat was juicy. Great find!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a burrito at lunch. Biggest burrito I've ever encountered. So good. Quick service!"}
{"text":"A total hidden gem. Reminds me of the food I get back home on the streets of the Central Valley (Cali) taco especial and burritos are to die for, they are crazy huge portions. Come hungry!!!"}
{"text":"Ok... So it's in a strip mall and it resembles a hospital cafeteria...the food however does not reflect the surroundings! It's delicious! Seriously! The biggest burrito in the U.S. and one of the most delicious. The ingredients are fresh and authentically prepared. This isn't your Americanized version, this is the authentic Mexican version. Go here... Eat mas!"}
{"text":"They are a very authentic place, with great food.  It's a smaller place, a little divey, but overall I love their food!  I know the reviews say price is $ - that is wrong.  The price is $$ - and that is my only reason for not giving them 5 stars.  The menu is small and if you come for lunch its going to cost you $15."}
{"text":"The burritos are huge!! For $10 me and a 3.5 year old split one, and we only are 1/2! They tasted really good but I could have used a little less onion in it. It was also weird to have to buy a bottle of water when I'm use to just getting a free glass of water when I go out to eat. If I'm ever in the mood for burritos though we'll definitely be back. Can't beat the size for the price."}
{"text":"First of all I love myself a burrito. This place is one of the best places to get an authentic Mexican burrito in Madison. Fast service good portions."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I eat here maybe every 10 days?  On average?  Me thinks this is one of the best (top 5) taco restaurants in the Madison area.  I've eaten here maybe one hun...uhhhh.....a lot?  Anywayz....they know what I want....and I bring everybody here....my daughter likes the steak....my son chicken....and my girlfriend chorizo....if you come for tacos you order the especial...with NO crema...just kidding....I don't like it but my cutee patootee does.  I ordered tacos over the phone when I first started eating here 2 or 3 years ago....walked out with a fish....they speak mainly spanish and I speak mainly....well....only english....anywayz...they're a lot better at that now.    I'm drinking a diet coke.....it's too early for beer....before 5...3 on Fridays....and anything goes on the weekend. *wink*  Cheers!!"}
{"text":"Simple, flavorful authentic family run Mexican restaurant where you can get a solid meal for $10 or under. I had the aqua fresca tamarindo and a steak soft taco especial. Wonderful."}
{"text":"First time order the food is delicious no regret if you like adventure the food you should try the tacos and chimichanga mmm yummy even the rice and salad nice"}
{"text":"Good taste and portions are big but wait.... insanely overpriced THEY CHARGED ME $3.00 FOR A CUP OF WATER!!! Are you kidding me? Didn't like that part but the rest it's just fine -.-"}
{"text":"First time visiting,  won't be the last.  Came with a group.  The food is very authentic and the portions are ridiculous.  Good price.  Nothing fancy inside,  but don't miss the chance if you come to Madison and are close to the airport.  The horchata is legit!  Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Go here but don't tell anyone how awesome it is because YOU are okay but your friends are JERKS and once they find out about this place they will come here all the time and tell all of THEIR stupid friends and there will be a line and a wait and I CANNOT have that."}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! The portion sizes are huge so be warned!! This is fantastic food.. even standard items such as the beans; rice and tortillas were wonderful on their own. Someone really knows how to cook! Do not pass this up if you are in the area. As other reviews have noted, it is a bit hard to find, it is actually on Dwight street, which is a block north of Washington -- it is in the middle of a strip mall on the 4500 E. block of Dwight, well worth a couple of extra turns to get to."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting. I went in tonight and ordered 2 chimichanga dinners one with beans and one without. The person taking my order was rude and walked away while I'm talking. He didn't speak except to ask what I wanted. Then the chef comes with a toothpick protruding from his mouth and brings only one dinner. I said \"no I wanted 2 steak chimichanga dinners, if he wasn't walking away while I'm talking to him he would have heard me.\" I get the second dinner and beans on the side(because those were forgotten for a second time).  I get home and as I'm eating a chimichanga from the second dinner a toothpick stabs me in the mouth. I'm pissed and disgusted and I take the food back to the restaurant for a refund. The chef smirks at me when I point out the toothpick in my chimichanga. Like are you f'ing serious? I don't know if that was the one from his mouth or not but that's disgusting and I've filed a police report and plan to call OSHA in the morning. Now I have to make a doctors appointment to get tested because the toothpick stabbed me in the mouth. Was it really that serious to drop a toothpick in my food?"}
{"text":"Best guacamole in town. Hands down. Amazing. I'm still high on the flavors. Very friendly staff. I went at an odd time, around 2:30pm and the men working were very friendly and fast. Had my order in less than 10 minutes. I had a tamales and a torda. Delicious."}
{"text":"4 stars? Not even close. Came in for lunch during my visit to Madison. Ordered some steak tacos. Steak has no flavor what so ever and was very bland. I will give it credit that the tacos are huge but it doesn't matter if there isn't any flavor. Went to pay and handed the cashier my Amex card. He swipes it twice and says \"I don't think my machine takes this card\". I stated that the sign on the door says you do take Amex. He swipes it again and it magically worked. Amex charging you a % is not my problem so don't lie and says your machine isn't working."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this place. We ordered the mexican carne asada which had a great portion but it was lacking flavor no seasoning on meat and no salt in beans. Place was also understaffed so service was a little slow but they were very friendly. Jamaica drink was very good and good size."}
{"text":"I did not have a chance to sample the food.  It was about a year ago but worth mentioning.  I walked in with my girlfriend, and there were plenty of waitstaff and a large Hispanic group of people, they were all talking in Spanish.  Not one of the servers disengaged to greet us and instead looked at us with unappealing stares.  We stayed there for about 5 minutes, and after not being greeted (or seated) we walked out.  If you don't speak Spanish, avoid this place.  McDonalds next door is a far better bet.  I would also avoid their food cart as well."}
{"text":"I have been back twice since my review. It is just sooooooo delicious. My mouth is salivating at the thought of the warm, shredded, flavorful chicken. As I eat my burrito, I think, \"wow I wish this would last forever, this is so delicious, ahh so good\" and while I ponder these thoughts, my mouth fails to listen to my brain and noms the whole thing. I plan on trying the shrimp diablo and the tacos, in the mean time I will go get another incredible burrito."}
{"text":"No chips and salsa?  What!?!?  WHAT?!?!  Seriously...I can't think of another Mexican restaurant in the area that doesn't offer free chips and salsa....  We ordered food for the 4 of us (2 adults and 2 children) which consisted of 2 Chimichangas, 2 tacos for my wife, and 2 kids meals.  With 3 drinks, our bill came to $41 and change.  This place is definitely more expensive than most Mexican restaurants in the area.  The waiter didn't give me ice in my water, which made it very tepid.  The service was slow as well.  I don't know why everyone is rating this place so well.  I'm used to getting free chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants, especially for $40+ for 4 people.  WE definitely won't be back here."}
{"text":"Um, I wanted a burrito. What I got was the size of my calf. I got the chicken burrito for $9. I now have upwards of three meals. The chicken was great. By no means dry or lacked flavor. Added a huge heap of burrito swag (tomato, lettuce, cheese, rice, beans, sour cream and more, I'm sure). It took up the entire take out box!!!!  Now let me reverse to the experience up until this point. I crave burritos and I was picking school supplies when the craving hit. So I checked out what was recommended on yelp. Drove all of .5 miles from the mall. I pulled up and this guy is pacing back and forth, singing to his rap that is blasting in his ears. He had an odd aura about him but I proceeded. I walked in and is was for sure a hole in the wall. Clean. Decorating included the standings in the world's cup and post it notes on the drink cooler. This is exactly how I like my Mexican food though. Authentic in taste and no extra jazz."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to leave a review and Reviewer on 4/20/2014 hit the nail on the head with exactly what I was thinking. Food was good, staff was nice, place is a little hard to find and I had to debate whether or not I would actually go in. I went here because of my pregnancy craving for enchiladas and have found none since being in Madison for a year. The chicken enchiladas were delicious and exactly the authentic flavor I was looking for. I also had the flautas which were just as tasty. My husband enjoyed his tacos. He had more filling than he expected and had enough for leftovers. Definitely good food if you are willing to give it a try. It really reminded me that places like Qdoba and Chipotle are like \"fast food\" and missing that good authentic flavor that I loved about my favorite restaurant back at home."}
{"text":"Amazing! I ordered just one taco as I was going for ice cream after, and it was huge! It came with all the toppings (even avocado which is usually an extra) and it was great."}
{"text":"Awesome lengua tacos! Try it. You won't regret it! . Very authentic place, good service."}
{"text":"A day later, we are still talking about this meal! Easily the best mexican food we have ever had (and we have eaten a lot all over the US), and probably one of the best meals I've eaten ever.  We ate lengua (beef tongue) tacos and cheese enchiladas and guacamole... I don't even know what the flavorings were, but everything melted in the mouth. Just superb.  Cannot recommend this place enough, and we will be back if we come through Madison again.  Food came out in  less than 10 minutes, so that's also a plus. Very friendly folks."}
{"text":"My English 1 teacher gave out an assignment to visit a new restaurant and write a review of it. Since my wife and I have already been to virtually every affordable restaurant on the east side, finding a place to write about was a bit of a challenge, but after scouring Google, I found this tiny Mexican place just off East Washington. When we pulled up, we were immediately put off by the lack of decor and cheap, worn furnishings that looked like they'd come secondhand from an office's break room, but I had a grade to earn, so we forged ahead. The place initially appeared to be empty, but after we walked in a server appeared from the back.  The menus consisted of printed pages in the heavy plastic booklets typical of small diners, and provided virtually no information about the meals beyond names and prices. Feeling only slightly adventurous, my wife ordered something mysterious called pambazo, but asked for chicken rather than the chorizo the server suggested. I decided to play it safe and ordered the mole; though I've never had it as a dish by itself, at least I've had meals including mole sauce before. The server explained to me in Spanish peppered with English that they were out of chicken, but he could make it with beef instead. \"Is good,\" he assured me.   Our food arrived in surprisingly short order. Pambazo turned out to be a giant sandwich-thing featuring shredded chicken, a crumbly white cheese and vegetables on puffy bread. The chicken was bland and watery and the vegetables shriveled -- both obviously came out of a can -- but the tasty bread saved the dish.  The mole came on a wide plate with a huge hunk of beef drowned in the thick brown mole sauce at one end, a pool of runny, bland refried beans on the other, and a thin strip of white rice down the middle. Additionally, a stack of tiny corn tortillas were kept warm in a container on the side.   The mole itself was pretty good; the beef was tender and shredded easily under my fork, and the sauce had a rich, earthy flavor with just a hint of bitterness. However, I'm not sure what I was supposed to do with the tortillas. Though the thick, warm tortillas you have with butter before a meal at Pedro's came to mind, there was nothing to put on these and they were thin and oddly dry. I decided to try making little mole taco/burrito-things out of them, but they were so small that if I tried to wrap up more than a bite at a time it got pretty messy.  When we were full, there was still enough food on our plates to get an entire second dinner out of it. Our waiter had left the building sometime during our meal, so I wandered back to the counter to find someone who could get us to-go boxes. The only other person there was the cook, who was occupied way in the back of the kitchen, but there was a tall stack of styrofoam boxes next to the register. I helped myself to two of them.  After boxing up our leftovers, there was nothing left to do but pay and leave. This is the part that every business truly lives for, and it's the one part that they almost never get wrong; no matter how poor the service is, you can always count on them being happy to take your money. Sadly, this was the restaurant's biggest failure. Wherever the server wandered off to, he still hadn't returned. I went up to the counter and managed to get the cook's attention, but he showed no interest in taking my money, only assuring me \"he'll be right back\", presumably referring to the server. He returned to the back of the kitchen and placed a phone call. We stood around and waited for several minutes. I was about ready to just guesstimate the bill and leave cash on the table when our server finally returned.  The prices are comparable to Pedro's or other similar Mexican restaurants, but the food is merely adequate, and both the atmosphere and service are practically non-existent. While I wouldn't necessarily be opposed to giving them a second chance, given the number of restaurant options in the area, I doubt I ever will."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and thought I'd grab a few tacos on the way home. Stood at the counter for a few minutes before anyone came to take my order, then they walked away to help another customer while I was in the middle of placing my order... never came back.  A few minutes later a takeout box appeared with the two taco especials I'd managed to order before the server disappeared. Just as well because they're so big I couldn't have eaten three! These tacos are so chock full of fillings you need a fork to eat them. I had the steak and pork, both were delicious but I slightly preferred the steak.  Food is cheap, filling, and delicious even if service is lacking."}
{"text":"Had previously eaten here with friends and the food was AMAZING! However - my husband and I returned  (I am a disabled veteran, and had my Service Dog). We were told we had to leave because the dog could not be there. We explained he was a Service Dog, but they refused to allow us to be there with him. We left - and won't be back. Authorities and advocates have been appropriately contacted. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Ordered a carne asada burrito to go, and it was gigantic. It was so big that it was impossible to eat by hand, and there wasn't much flavor in the meat."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I decided to venture out for some Mexican after spending a long day in the yard. Something about tacos, horchata, and piles of rice and beans just sounded right, you know? I was perusing yelp for something new and came across this joint - and man was that an awesome find. Seriously, guys. This place is great. I ordered the Carne Asada with Plantains and my Girlfriend ordered 2 chicken tacos.  The carne asada was flavorful and delicious, the rice and beans tasted fresh and actually had flavor (what!?), and the salad it came with had a ton of avocado and a tasty lime vinaigrette. Then there were the plantains. Normally when you get a side of plantains you get a little lump of them on the side of your plate...not here. I was given two WHOLE plantains that were sliced in half and fried perfectly. They took up half of the plate and they were delicious. As for the tacos, they looked good, they were gigantic, and I was told they tasted very fresh. Also, the horchata was giant sized and delicious. I saved half to drink the next day. Anyway, this place rocked and is currently the only Mexican in town that can compete with Taqueria Guadalajara. Good stuff, man."}
{"text":"you know it's good Mexican food when only Mexicans are dining in! At first, the prices were like \"WTF!\" (yeah I said wtf) BUT when my humongous carnitas gordita came out, I seriously was only able to eat that one item, the carnitas was loaded in that pocket!!!  (great maiz flavor of the gordita masa, by the way) My guest chose the carne asada Hondureno and it had 5 large thinly sliced steak pieces and 4 large halves of delicious fried plaintain... very delicious.  The beans (frijoles de la hoya) had sooooo much flavor.  BIG prices but also BIG portions... it is afterall Madison Wisconsin ;)"}
{"text":"A great value for your money - this will fill you up! Gordita is messy and delicious."}
{"text":"Just moved from SoCal and I gotta say this place makes me feel back at home. Authentic Mexican food is hard to find out here but this place has nailed it. Ginormous portions too!"}
{"text":"I got a tripa taco and an al pastor sope.  The tripa itself was no-compromise flavorful, but alone the taco it would have been not so fulfilling - - but together with that amazing sope it was a feast, for $6.   The cornmeal in the sope was not thick - - it was lighter than the taco shell(s) - - but heaped with an al pastor like none I'd ever had - - rich, red, strong in flavor - - and the onion and very fresh cilantro (and nice salsa) made for a VERY sumptious, flavorful, and satisfying meal.  It could be that the cuisine (from Queretaro?) is different than the Michoacan and Guanajuato I'm used to, but it was very unique, distinctive, and great care was put into making it highly flavorful.  Like with Los Gemelos, which I also hugely enjoy in its two Madison locations,  I would highly recommend getting at least one sope, as opposed to just tacos."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try this place considering all of the reviews on Yelp. I am an authentic taco aficionado. I grew up in the South, traveled to Texas and Southern California, in addition to dating many Latin folks in my past...I know Latin cuisine and tacos. I tired two of their pastor tacos and was so disgusted that I could not eat my food. The pork was rubbery, with large chunks of cubed fat throughout. Also in the taco (which was unexpected) was sauteed onions. I would say the taco was 40% pork and 60% slimy onions. I requested a spicy salsa with my dish and received a moderately spiced salsa verde...I was disappointed. I noticed that most of the reviews on here mention this place is so great because of portion size, but taste must by taken into consideration and this was so sub par that I'd rather go to taco bell than dine here."}
{"text":"I may be a bit spoiled by my \"home\" taqueria (Taco Rico in Lafayette, Indiana), but I was a bit disappointed. We weren't offered water to drink, nor chips and salsa. The prices were also higher than I expected for a $ listing. On the plus side, the food was tasty and plentiful, and the service staff quick. Worth stopping by if you're in the neighborhood, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"YAASSSSSS!  I was craving tacos (authentic tacos) so i stopped by--I was not disappointed. I ordered the carnitas with beans and rice. It was so goooood. I don't think you understand--IT WAS SOOO GOOOD.  This was probably the best carnitas I've ever had. Perfectly proportionate--lots of carnitas, beans, rice, onions, tortillas, hot sauce. I gorged myself. I'm surprised that I was able to walk out of there without assistance.  My mouth is watering as I'm typing this. I am definitely going to visit again and try something different. Or maybe I'll just have another giant plate of carnitas."}
{"text":"No thank you. Way overly priced. $10 for a small burrito! Taste was ok. Sour cream smelled weird. Was really hoping this was going to be my husbands go to spot since it's closer to home. We are used to Southern California Mexican food and giving every place the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, not this place. An hour after we ate, ran straight to the bathroom."}
{"text":"I'm in Madison for the night and pulled into a strip mall near my hotel to check my email, and saw this place. Out of curiosity, I looked it up on Yelp.   Normally I stay away from Mexican food in the Midwest. Even the authentic places tone it down for the gringos. I thought I might try it later on tonight. After checking into the hotel and sorting out work related issues, it was time for dinner. And this place didn't disappoint.   It is more like the taquerias I visit in Texas (and in Mexico in the past). The menu is limited, and there isn't chips and salsa on the tables (it is on the menu, however). I think that is an American thing. Chips just fill me up so I can't finish my meal.  I ended up with the steak burrito and a steak taco. They quickly came out and both were huge. The taco was on corn tortillas, and the meat was piled on it, along with cilantro and onions. I added a little green salsa to it and I was in heaven. I still had that monster burrito to eat.  The thing was stuffed with grilled steak, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, a few beans, and what looked like queso chalco. Yumyumyum. Halfway through, I unfolded the tortilla and just started eating the innards with a fork. A young lady came in and after studying the menu, asked what I was eating. I told her it was the burrito, and she ordered one to go. The last time I had a burrito that big was when I was living in California, 15 years ago."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Madison & seeing the good reviews here, we decided to give it a try. We are frequent travelers to Mexico, consider ourselves foodies & love to both cook & eat Mexican food. One member of our party said it was the best chimichanga she'd ever eaten. The tacos were delicious  - especially the tongue. Tortillas & chips were fresh & delicious. The tamales were very tender, filled with tender chicken & a nice green salsa. The  whole fried plantains that came with the Honduran carne asada were to-die-for. Portions were huge & the service excellent. A very authentic and affordable taqueria."}
{"text":"Such a delicious place. Lots of food for a very reasonable price. The service is fast. The food is incredibly fresh and cooked to order."}
{"text":"I was wrapping up a road trip and staying at a hotel, so what'd I do? I Yelp'ed for Mexican takeout. When I read some of the other reviews, I decided to drive by a couple chains and find the hole-in-the wall that promised to hit the spot.   The menu was in Spanish and had just a few choices. I was the only white girl in there. And I basically just pointed to what I wanted, got a nod and a smile and BAM - the food was packed and ready to go.   And it was GOOD. Not just, it'll do after a long day in the car, but \"maybe I'll head back to Madison one day\" good. If you're passing through or want more authentic Mexican than you're used to, keep your eyes pealed and pull in, point and smile."}
{"text":"This place is a bit off the beaten path, tucked behind the Crown Plaza in a run down strip mall next to a Mexican grocery store. Best damn tacos I've had in a long time and at a great price! All I needed was two and I was full. They do have a whole menu but when the tacos are so good, why stray?"}
{"text":"This cute little food cart appeared in front of my office yesterday (corner of Whitney Way and University Avenue) so a few of us wandered down to check it out!  The unassuming trailer had a hand written menu on a whiteboard and one guy inside taking orders AND making the food (fresh with each order I might add).  So the cart was slow, but well worth the wait!  I went for the $9 chicken enchiladas with rice and beans and they were OUTSTANDING!  An appropriately hot verde sauce topped the fantastic puled chicken wrapped in a authentic corn tortillas.  Lots of toppings included Mexican cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a spicy sour cream drizzle.  There was so much food in there that it's my lunch again today!  If you see this little cart, don't let the simple exterior fool you....they saved all the energy for making the fantastic food!!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos I got were very different from the pictures on Yelp, and they don't have chicken taco. It's underwhelming but maybe that's how tacos are actually like in Mexico? The best tacos I had are from Chelsea Market in Manhattan."}
