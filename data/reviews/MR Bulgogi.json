{"text":"Yum......, the food is so delicious. Would highly recommed getting Bulgogi over rice and a side of dumplings."}
{"text":"The staff is always beyond friendly and truly appear passionate about their food. Every time I see them, they are my go to food truck. Their half and half bowl is delicious, and their specialty tacos turned out to be just as quality. Love these guys!"}
{"text":"Mr Bulgogi was located outside of Biddle's Escape this evening. We were dying to try it out since we have never had it before. Staff were so friendly! I ordered the spicy pork bowl and my hubby got the half and half bowl which was half spicy pork and half bulgogi beef. We ordered the chicken dumplings for my daughter and the guy taking the orders asked us if it was for a child. When we said yes he added rice and a water with it. No extra charge! 
They had single foil sheets sitting out to make it easy to cover your food and take it to go. My pork was great! Zero complaints and there were 2 dumplings included with the bowls. My hubby said the beef was spicy but still really good. 
There was not a long wait time once you ordered. Really everything was perfect. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I walked up to the food truck and it was playing \"Gangam Style\", so I knew this would be something to remember.  I got the Bulgogi combo with meat and dumplings over rice.  It had just enough spice, not too much. but perfect.  The combo of the cilantro (if you are not a cilantro person, just get it on the side)  and the kimchi with the sauces makes me want to dance.  You can mix and match items and get additional sauces if preferred.   The owner and his crew are fast, efficient and super friendly.  Look for this one."}
{"text":"Run!  do not walk to this food truck! Had their combo tonight ... sliced beef/kimchi/rice bowl tonight @hitchhiker brewing. It was incredibly flavorful... also had these dumplings that were so delicious!"}
{"text":"MR Bulgogi food truck and Couch Brewery have this awesome set up: Bingo, Brews and Bulgogi on Wednesday nights! And to be honest, I agreed to these plans with my friends just to try MR Bulgogi! The food was verrrrry good, I got the Korean BBQ tacos and then the nachos (Korean style). The food had so much flavor and just the right spicy with the kimchi. However the portions are so small; that's why I needed the nachos as well. They were also very pricey for the size (9$ for 3 4inch tacos). My friends said they didn't think the food-to-price was worth it since they were all left hungry. I'd have to agree. I have a goal to try all Pittsburgh food trucks because I believe them to be the more authentic food at a (usually) reasonable price. So I am glad I tried MR Bulgogi, but next time it'll probably a drinking munchie snack and not dinner."}
{"text":"They were at Helicon Brewing on Saturday and we stopped by.  The bulgogi was flavorful, as should be expected.  The perfect amount of sauce and additions. We tried both the bowl and the tacos and would get both again.  Good amount of food.  Looking forward to seeing this food truck again."}
{"text":"Had the Bulgogi rice bowl and dumplings. All was delicious. One of the best food trucks in the Burgh. Don't miss this one! Nice people too!"}
{"text":"Tried Mr Bulgogi for the first time at the PGH Taco festival. Hands down one of the best food trucks there."}
{"text":"I was able to catch this food truck outside of Leaning Cask Brewery.  I was intrigued by the truck and wasn't sure what to expect. They were super friendly, the food was awesome, and it was super quick.  I wasn't sure about getting thw lwttuce and green onions on my rice and meat bowl. I got the beef and spicy pork. It was fantastic. The fried dumplings are out of this world good. Definitely get an extra order. 

I am so happy with the friendly smiles and service I recieved. They were fast and efficient and friendly. I will definitely go back. One of the best food trucks in PA."}
{"text":"You can try to resist but the smell of the delicious beef will drag you to this truck. It is the best bulgogi I a have ever had. The flavor is so intense that my eyes rolled back in my head. not too spicy but a little heat. Its just really really good food. the Bulgogi is the star but combined with the rice, kimchi and dumplings it was heaven.  You will not be disappointed. If this truck is an option make it your choice."}
