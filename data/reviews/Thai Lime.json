{"text":"My in-laws live across the street from the plaza this restaurant is located in and they love the food. Everytime we go over to their place they always treat us to Thai Lime. I have to say I've enjoyed many of their dishes. Personally I've eaten there over 20 times, never had a hair or bad service. My favorites are the PAD THAI,mango chicken and chicken spring rolls. Their recipes are a lot better than many of the places along Yonge street. Not 100% authentic thai but then again how many places are? I used to live in Nonthaburi for 1 year and not even the other restaurants listed by another member come close to the amazing cuisine found in many of Nonthaburi restaurants, diners. So what's the down side of this restaurant? I would say that the atmosphere of the restaurant is too dark for families, great for dates though."}
{"text":"I just tried to call in a takeout order here and it was so impossible to deal with the man on the other end, I had to say forget it and hang up. I wanted to order Pad see-ew which is number 55 on the menu, and he had literally no idea what I was asking for. 

I told him the number, he said \"wrong restaurant (it wasn't) we have so many menus, you can't say the number, say the name, what you want what you want!!\"
I spelled the dish out for him to no avail, I said it in multiple ways because I figured I may be pronouncing it wrong, nothing. 

Should a restaurant not know the item numbers on its own menu? He was also extremely rude. It's too bad, because I live so close, but will never be back."}
{"text":"I did a pick up order from Thai Lime and got the pad thai with chicken. I get pad thai at almost every Thai restaurant I go to and have had many a pad thai in Thailand as well, but definitely am not a pad thai connoisseur. I do, however, know when it tastes like ketchup and this place's pad thai doesn't taste like ketchup. Next day, it seems to taste even better. 

I appreciate that they put a bunch of bean sprouts and green onions on top of it, a slice of lime and orange on top of it. They also use a reusable container so you can use it again instead of throwing it away like a wasteful styrofoam container.

I thought the portions would be huge based on the reviews but it's not as huge as say a Salad King to go box. The container is about an inch deep and a pop can and quarter length wise. It's a good amount of food, don't get me wrong, but not huge like Salad King sizes where I could spread it over 3 meals almost!

Pick up time was accurate and by the time I got there, it was all ready to go. I'd go back in the future!"}
{"text":"I always order my Thai from Thailime- they are consistent and reliable. The portions are really large, and always get it right and are always on time."}
{"text":"Pad thai is okay, its more on the sour side... (not a fan of sour food)
fried rice is overkilled with black pepper! and too oily...
chicken wings is more on the burnt side and with the taste of old oil... maybe they just didnt like me -.-'"}
{"text":"The only reason im giving it two stars was because i was hungry!!! Maybe it was cause i waited for an hour and a half for 4 dishes! Oh wait and that includes spring rolls! The manager was so rude about us calling and inquiring when it was coming. They told us 45 mins. Yet somehow our order was complicated. He also hungup on us. So thats that. 

The mango chicken was over cooked chicken but undercooked mango. Zucchini in the basil beef. First when did that vegetable ever be introduced into thai cooking? And second basil beef is suppose to be spicy or at least have a kick? I asked for pad thai spicy... My dog didnt even flinch at the leftovers. 

This is the worst... Worst thai food outside of a foodcourt. And most times this is worse!

Sorry that my first post has to be negative!"}
{"text":"Not happy with our meal. Everything was incredibly sweet to the point of it being inedible.  The lemon chicken soup broth had no tang of sour or lemon just sweet and only a few vegetables in the dish.

Ordered the vegetarian curry pad thai and because the description on the menu didn't say vegetables I double checked when i called that the dish did in fact have vegetables and not not tofu and egg. The women on the phone told me that the dish did come with veggies in it. So, I ordered it. The dish came and it was chicken furry pad thai. First off this wasn't what we ordered and secondly it was so sickly sweet we couldn't eat it.

I ordered shrimp chips and peanut sauce and the chips were so stale that they were not crunchy anymore but crewy and inedible, not to mention they give you free ones anyways and the girl could have told me that on the phone.

Anyways, BAD food and waste of money and food because we threw it out"}
{"text":"Service and food is great.  I have eaten both at restaurant and have gotten take out both are equally geat"}
{"text":"Got takeout. Food is okay if you don't really care about authenticity. The appetizer sampler was huge. The food didn't excite. The green curry was not the best but I could tell it was green curry.

If I need to order food for my poker crew and they decide that they want to be finished wolfing down a huge amount of Thai within an hour, I'll order from here again."}
{"text":"I received food poisoning from here. It was either chicken satay or spring rolls. I had nothing to eat prior and was sick with 1 hour after eating it.   Just a heads up for fellow Thai food lovers."}
{"text":"Good go to thai food. The portions are hardy and the food is tasty. It is not over the top amazing, but it is reliably good and affordable."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery through just eat (mainly because I saw a $5 off coupon code earlier in the day and it's gross out and I'm off so I'm being lazy). The place I normally order from wasn't doing delivery, which is why I tried out Thai Lime. 

Everything was delicious!
I bought myself the meal special for two (pad thai, 2 spring rolls, rice, red curry chicken)..lots for food for $23.99! Everything was tasty, fresh, and flavourful. The food came within the estimated time and the delivery guy followed my annoying, awkward apartment entrance instructions.

Can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"My only complaint was that one of our orders came out 10 minutes later. I've been here 3-4 times and it hasn't happened since. All the meals I've had have been great. A lot better then some of the other Thai places I've been to. I'd highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"just came back from there, first time, food was very good i had the green salad and calamari, and bf had the spicy beef , nice presentation in terms of food and big portions . highly recommended"}
{"text":"The best curry pad Thai (try the chicken) I have ever tried, way better than any downtown.  I love that they deliver to the downtown core as well, definitely one of my favorite spots in the city. 
They're Malaysian curry is also something else.  I totally recommend trying this place for any Thai food enthusiast."}
{"text":"I had some high-hopes of finding a thai restaurant within walking distance of where I work, and this was the best option.

I will start off with saying their lunch specials are a great deal...$8.99 for a pad thai and spring roll and the portions were good (they have a few combos, can't remember the exact prices bit this was the one I had) 

The veggie spring rolls were really, really good. 

The pad thai, on the other hand, was Okay. It was incredibly rich, saucy and a bit greasy.  It did not taste like traditional pad thai, but it was still pretty tasty. It is a bit heavy for a lunch meal, though, and hard to eat all of it.
------

I wanted to update this, as I've tried other dishes here that we're great!
I actually enjoyed the curry pad thai alot more then the regular. The Green Veggie/Chicken curry is also very delicious. 

The mango shakes are so yummy!

Upping this place to 4 stars because I visit often and have yet to be disappointed!


The waitress was very friendly and the service was great."}
{"text":"Based on the many high ratings I decided to give Thai Lime a try for a night in with delivery. I ordered a few more things then usual hoping to share the cuisine with a friend who was unfamiliar with it. Overall, it is really Chinese food with some Thai influences. Really missed the mark with elements that distinguish the cuisine. There was no basil in the dishes, no to little lemon grass, one tiny sprig of coriander on the curry pad Thai. I could taste no coconut milk where expected in the curry pad Thai and the Thai hot and sour soup was not at all Thai, rather a classic Chinese soup with canned baby corn, black fungus and all. The online order site was easy to use but didn't offer any of the free options such as spring rolls that are advertised if you might place an order over phone. My advice to the owners would be to either unabashedly switch to chinese food and do it properly or to take the time to learn what Thai food entails, either the Canadianized version of it or some echo of authentic Thai."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today. Don't let a three star rating come across as a bad review. 

The green curry chicken I had was satisfying. The spring roll was good too. Their lunch menu is comprehensive and well priced. Don't go expect to be blown away by flavour. Expect a decent local Thai spot.

Service was prompt. For sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"So glad to have this new place in our neighbourhood!  I've been looking in vain to find a place to fill my basil chicken cravings since Urban Thai closed.  Excellent food.  And they have high-quality meat, which is always an important litmus test for me for Thai or Chinese restaurants.  We got take-out, but the restaurant is good-looking inside."}
{"text":"The food here is fresh and tasty. Highly recommend the Thai curries, red and green, its creamy, a bit spiced, and sweet.  I love how they always come with so much variety of vegetable. They really don't skim on the ingredients. The pad Thai is also really good. The price is very decent. Always go for the special combo for takeout.  The place is hidden in a discreet plaza. It might look a little grimy from the exterior, but inside is new and clean."}
{"text":"Used to like this place but the last couple of times I got delivery it was not great. Bland, globby, not good. And delivery took an hour, despite living close by and ordering early."}
{"text":"Had a great delivery meal from these guys on Christmas Eve.  We got eight dishes all together and every one was a hit, from the play-it-safe vegetable Pad Thai to the adventurous Crispy Red Snapper.  The Malay dish we tried was also great.  We'll definitely get it again."}
{"text":"I came here and tried the beef Malay/Malaysia curry. It was tasty and spicy, which I liked. A bit on the sweet side though. The portions were pretty good. It wasn't what I expected but it was delicious nonetheless. I had expected something more like golden/yellow curry. 

Service was quick and friendly. Place was a little bit too dark for my liking but maybe it's meant to be the ambience. Tables a bit too close to one another but I went at a quiet time.

Overall, I'd come here again but probably won't be getting the Malaysia curry again. The place is a bit on the expensive side so I probably won't be coming here too often."}
{"text":"'...Food is okay if you don't really care about authenticity...some other Yelp chump will be tempted to make the same mistake that I made for 30+ dollars today...Not sure which taste direction they were aiming for, but the soup tastes literally hot and sour, and doesn't have any flavour beyond that...I actually had to send it back...completely raw green peppers and zucchini and soggy broccoli...I tasted it but didn't really like it...I may or may not buy from here again...' 
   The preceding is culled from the Yelp reviews and all is accurate. We ordered soup and the Spicy Beef salad three nights in a row and they never got it right; unspiced beef, no  lime/salt/sweet flavors, just some solid caramelized brown fish-sugar mystery \"dressing\" glop in a small bowl, on the side, that stayed firmly stuck in the bowl when inverted. How does one add this booger-y stuff to a green salad? Insulted, finally, we made great sport, flying the wee bowl around like a mini flying saucer attacking the planet of Green Plastic Chopsticks or pretending to 'spill' it, until tattoo-ed wait-bot took the hint and produced...Good Lord, is it 'Imitation Sri Racha'?  We sent the Coconut Chicken soup back because it wasn't any different from the Thai Mushroom or Hot & Sour mistakes ordered the nights before. It all tasted the same and not good, completely lacking that punch that Thai food has. How can a 'chef' screw up a lime/nam plah dressing?"}
{"text":"Cheap Thai food, ok quality..

There are only a few things I will say about Thai Lime

It's Thai food and it's cheap.
So if you are in the mood for Thai but don't want to spend a lot of money, it's perfect. On the other hand, if you have a bigger budget and you are in the mood for Thai, go elsewhere. Oh! and stay away from the Phad Thai this is not their best dish, trust me one of the worst I've had."}
{"text":"Reasonable food for a reasonable price.

I am not a Thai Food expert but the food seems Okay to me. I usually get the chicken Pad Thai, the spicy chicken and some veggy spring rolls, all to go. I will have to try more of the menu to see how consistent it is but for what I know I like, its good. 

Just good though.

Prompt service with a smile - but I call ahead on my way home and always tip well!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken Pad Thai. It was ok.  Staff was friendly. The place smelled a tad musty. With taxes it cost me about $11."}
{"text":"Great food, decent prices, great service, great Thai food experience.

I came in during lunch time and got a Pad Thai with mushroom soup as a part of their lunch specials. Both the soup and Pad Thai were very tasty. The service was very decent where I was checked up on several times a few times during my stay to make sure everything was going well. To top it off, I got a free scoop or two of ice cream for desert. Would definitely go back to this place, was very happy with it.

I see myself returning to this venue and/or ordering delivery from there."}
{"text":"My favourite and go-to thai food restaurant. I always get delivery, so no comment on the restaurant itself.

The pad thai is yummy, if a bit saucy, the thai fried rice is amazzzing. We love the thick curry (chicken or beef or veggie) comes with lots of vegetables and sauce and pineapple. The chicken coconut soup is also really good, although quality seems to change depending on the chef/night."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and tastes good. Some of my fave dishes are their curried chicken pad Thai, regular pad Thai , spring rolls and glass noodles. All the dishes I ever tried here has not disappointed me. Their interior is very modern and clean. They deliver fairly quickly.... Usual come within 30 minutes after ordering. You can also order online."}
{"text":"Thai Lime has become one of my places of choice since I moved to the Junction. Great prices + quick service + generous portions + amazing Thai food! 

Their lunch menu options are excellent - a good selection of appetizers + main dishes for 10.99. I have tried the chicken mango and the green curry chicken and both are really flavourful, solid dishes, yet my biggest surprise when I came to this place for the first time were the calamari - tender, very well cooked, tasty, the perfect appetizer.

In my opinion one of the best Thai options in the hood, I have definitely become a fan. Also, free parking right in front of it :)"}
{"text":"I'm giving them another star because since my original review I've tried half of everything on their menu, and everything I've eaten has been delicious, and the portion sizes are still nice and big.

Also since then I've eaten at the restaurant a few times too, and it's really nice inside, which is surprising considering how awful the plaza and rest of the neighborhood look.

How awesome is the food? Everyone I've gotten to try it is now addicted, this includes all of my in-laws within delivery distance, everyone at work. Even the businesses beside my work are hooked.

My order changes every time, but it's always a combination of things that cost over $30 to qualify for free phad thai or mango chicken. Usually green curry chicken, mango chicken, and basil beef. Or if I don't really feel like Thai food I'll get Malay curry beef with an order or two of roti bread, with their vegetarian appetizer plate (mango salad, deep fried tofu with peanut sauce, spring rolls and salad rolls)."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times for lunch as well as take out/delivery.  The service is great and the staff really are attentive.  It's usually not too busy at lunch, probably due to the area and ordering and getting your food is very quick.  They have nice lunch specials priced in and around $10, which come with a main and your choice of an appetizer.  

The main things I like to order here are chicken the Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.  I usually get them with spring rolls or the calamari and they come out fresh and hot.  The portions are decent and it's more than enough to fill you up at lunch.  I usually request non spicy and they do a good job of catering to that.  Only when I order take out, do they seem to forget as I have received food here that was a bit too spicy for my taste and I could not finish it.

Overall it's a nice little spot for Thai, in an area that generally wouldn't have much in terms of international food.  I come here every once in a while and will continue to as the food is good and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Got delivery from here last night. Got the Coconut Shrimp, the Pad Thai and the Basil Beef. All were very great, very filling and tasty. It is kinda Canadian-Thai, definitely heavy on the salt and the sugar, but good for what it is.  

Only issue was they forgot the rice and it took 40 mins from when we called to get it. I would still order from here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Thai Lime this afternoon. The food came about ten minutes after the quoted time, and was luke warm. The portions were decent. The food was ok. 

I had: 
Thai spring rolls - larger than I expected. Unfortunately they did not come with sauce. I don't know if this was done erroneously, or if I was supposed to order that separately. Too bad, they really need that sauce!

Coconut chicken soup - The portion was fine for 1 person. If there are more of you, order 2. The soup was good. Nothing special, nothing offensive. I've had better, creamier coconut based soup in the past. This one had a nice lemony zing to it. 

Chicken and shrimp pad thai - Huge portion. The shrimp wasn't fresh. Spongy texture, fishy taste. I spit it out. The chicken was cooked well. The noodles were lacking in flavour. I had to mix it with the sauce from my red curry to give it life. 

Red Curry - this was the best thing I ordered. The portion was big enough for 2 to share. The veggies were warm and crispy. It needed hot sauce. 

I ordered a side of hot sauce. It was very spicy, with a burned flavour. 

All this, with $3 tip for driver and tax came to $41. Pretty reasonable. However, it was only ok. I don't think I'll order from here again. The food was pretty bland. The Pad Thai was a tremendous disappointment."}
{"text":"We tried out this restaurant for the first time via JustEat app delivery and it was pretty good.  First of all, they give great portions; it was a never ending dinner for us!  Delivery took exactly 1 hour, right to the minute as per their estimate, but comparatively longer than the other restaurants we've tried through the app.  Coconut shrimp arrived a bit cold, batter was not as crispy but this was the strongest coconut flavour I've ever tasted for this appetizer.  Pad Thai, Pad See-Ew and Pineapple Fried Rice were quite authentic-tasting albeit similar notes.  We were happy with our meal!"}
{"text":"Great food and the prices are very reasonable. The service was friendly and the restaurant is clean and welcoming. Great spot in my neighbourhood to eat."}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give Thai Lime a 2.5 star rating.

I've only had Thai Lime food once, but I couldn't resist adding them to my Thai food list.  We got the thai red curry, the pad thai, and the basil beef.  The red curry was quite nice, if a bit bland - I like a hint of sweetness (though not more than a hint), but I could definitely see myself ordering it again.  The pad thai was the low point - do you know what I mean by \"pink noodle\" thai?  Just lots of slippery pink noodles and not much flavour.  It's not the worst I've ever had, but I wouldn't order it again.  I'm not a connoisseur of basil beef, but I think it was everything it should be - beefy, basily, and lots of salty sauce.  

My friend lives practically next door; if I did, too, I'd probably order from them if there wasn't better Thai nearby, though I'd only order the pad thai if I was abjectly desperate."}
{"text":"We recently moved from downtown to closer to the Junction, and were looking for great Thai food that delivers, and tried this place after finding it online. The staff there are always friendly and the food is excellent. When we had it delivered, it was prompt and hot when we received it. This will definitely be out go-to Thai place from now on."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast and filling.  Sometimes that's all I need after a long day. I am talking about food, lol.  Not authentic, but I don't really care at this point when I'm starved.  If I wanted to eat authentic, I'll dine out.  The dishes can be a little on the sweet side, but overall satisfying.  I usually order the veggie spring rolls, chicken & shrimp pad thai and beef in oyster sauce with a side of rice."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food for a really good price.  If you order the amounts are massive!  Pud Thai near impossible to eat by one person in one go.  I still finish it but then I'm rolling around all sweaty on the floor in pain and smile on my face.  Very friendly service, nice people and much needed in the area where it's tough to find Thai food or a place that delivers that's quality like this."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a few Just Eat coupons kicking around and decided to order some food to use it up before they expired. Thai Lime had some pretty good reviews and they offer a variety of dishes so we thought we'd check it out and get some delivery.

While I've heard of good things from this place, I'm definitely a bit pickier considering some of the great and relatively affordable places available downtown, like Khao San Road, Sukhothai and Golden Thai. Heck, even Thai Express is pretty good for a fast-food place! 

Our order at Thai Lime was as follows: Lamb Malay Curry, Chicken Pad See-Ew and the Malay Roti. While my boyfriend didn't mind it as much as I did, I found the portions, while plentiful, were mainly attributed to the heavy sauce.  

Much of the volume of the meal was due to excessive grease and fat. Which isn't to say that it didn't taste good, just that it was absolutely greasy. It was the kind of delivery food that has the right amount of fat and flavour to make it taste better reheated in the microwave for lunch than it did as fresh food for dinner. The Pad See-Ew was pretty average, a little overly sweet, but when I mixed it up with the curry it gave the noodles more bite and made them more interesting. The Malay Roti was tasty, but also very greasy.

I'll give Thai Lime another shot, but only in my neighbourhood where options are limited."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise located north of the Landsdowne Subway Station, I discovered Thai Lime when a friend of mine who recently moved to the area brought me here for dinner. Located in a small strip mall which also contains an Ecuadorian restaurant, the decor of the restaurant truly stands out and the food and service were great. Not sure why there are many whiners complaining to the restaurant. Have they not tried the awfulness of the 'Ginger' chain of restaurant before criticizing this joint?  

Servings are large, ingredients are fresh, and and the restaurant is truly nice to have in a neighborhood that is starting to slowly see the signs of gentrification, especially with many factories slowly being converted into condominiums. Recommended if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Food is decent and the one delivery driver is hot.

It's a win in my books."}
{"text":"I couldn't eat most of the food I ordered, just seemed like it had been thrown together without the love needed to make it good."}
{"text":"I was staying at a friend's place in this neighborhood, and she had made no promises about the availability of vegetarian-friendly food. She wasn't due to be back for another day, so I ventured out to Dupont Street to give the neighborhood a try.

I saw this place and, looking over the menu, decided I didn't care how good it was. I just wanted some Thai food. 

I ordered the lychee lemon grass tofu. It was delicious. It was a great fusion of flavors I hadn't tried together before. The jasmine rice was perfect, and even though I tried my hardest to finish the whole thing, I had to bring half home. 

The atmosphere was nice. The furniture is comfortable and sleek-looking. The lights were dim but I could still see everything. I was slightly annoyed by the loud women a table over who kept complaining about their husbands, their male children, the other mothers and fathers they knew, and it went on and on.

Then again, I did go to the restaurant with my fly down. Epic fail."}
{"text":"We got delivery and it was really good! Delivery was fast and hot. We had the chicken curry pad thai, the lamb Malay curry, and the Malay roti bread. Big portions, especially the Malay curry. Malay curry had a lovely spiciness to it and both dishes had lots of nice fresh veggies. We also got 2 free spring rolls because the order was over $25. Yum!! I'm happy we discovered this place!"}
{"text":"Moved back into their delivery area, and am happy to say its as good as I remember it. They still have some of my favourite (albeit generic) pad thai in the city, and super tasty spring rolls to compliment... Green curry and Pad Woon Sen (stir-fry glass noodles) still consistent, andthe Cashew Chicken has a an enjoyable zest with the chili flakes in it you don't find most other places.

But can we talk about chicken wings for a second though? Thai Lime has decent thai wings (although heavily breaded), but I hate how places like this give you only 8 chicken wings and then put it with a salad to justify its size. Does the average person that wants to smash a plate of deep fried wings really care about some half assed iceberg lettuce and diced tomato with coriander based salad? I get this is how the restaurant justifies $9 for 8 wings, but man it really bugs me. I forgot how much it bugged me until my delivery showed up this weekend.

Wings aside, glad to be back in the Thai Lime delivery zone. Even with my hate for their chicken wings salad side dish, I'm giving this place 5 stars because it is now my #1 go to place for thai delivery since I'm back on the west side."}
{"text":"Dishes here are tasty and authentic compared to many other Thai restaurants in the city. Unfortunately my last order was disappointing. My noodle dish had shrimp that was powdery and soft (read: not fresh). Both my rice and noodle dishes are full of noodles and rice but little vegetables, shrimp or meat that they were supposed to come with. I get that the cost of running a restaurant is going up and up but they need to find ways to improve."}
{"text":"Love this joint! Amazing food and great prices. You gotta go during their lunch because you get a bomb ass meal for 10.99 which includes an appetizer (8 choices) and a meal (14-18 choices).  

The only problem I've had coming here is that they don't have enough staff. They have one waitress who works the whole place. They need more help because I waited way too long even just for my water. I can't blame the waitress at all because the place is busy and she needs time to catch up."}
{"text":"I've had thai lime on numerous occasions and keep going back.  While their thai food isn't the greatest in Toronto for easy delivery on Queen West it's the best i've found.  Their Pad Thai is quite good and they manage spice levels better than any other place i've had.  I would say that their curries are above average and the veggies are fresh.  

This is a staple in my delivery rotation, but would caution that their delivery times are rarely accurate.  I know for where I live it will be about an hour regardless of what they quote."}
{"text":"Don't order on justeat if you want to take advantage of their delivery special. Usually, you can get free springrolls for over $25 spent and free phad Thai or mango chicken for over $35. Recently, they have only allowed customers who order on their own website or telephone to receive this. Justeat customers who have previously been able to get this offer can no longer without warning. Even when you call the restaurant they will not \"throw it in\" because you have ordered with justeat. Poor customer service in my opinion. Why advertise on justeat then? 
The food, is average. Not bad. But not amazing. Curry sauces usually filled with more vegetables (peppers) than protein."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a Thai restaurant in the Junction Triangle. We sure need more restaurants here. 

I went to Thai Lime opening night and they were offering 25% off and free ice cream for dining in. I ordered the Classic Pad Thai and Shrimp rolls, and I was not disappointed with either of those choices. The Pad Thai was good and not too sweet, which is a problem I've experienced at other places, and the shrimp rolls were delicious. The portions at Thai Lime are large, two people can share an order of Pad Thai.   

The service was a little slow, but it was very understandable considering it was their first day. The decor is very nice, with modern furniture and lit candles on tables. The staff was very attentive and helpful.

It's great to have an Asian restaurant in the area, and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was surprisingly good. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4. 

Good service, decent portions, good flavours, nice decor. The price point was a bit higher than core downtown, but if you get takeout, it's pretty decent. Ordered the green curry dish and a noodle dish (not the pad thai, think it was called pad see meu or something like that)."}
{"text":"Fresh & modern come to mind when describing this place.  The service was exemplary and serving portions are more than adequate. This is my new top Thai spot !! A+"}
{"text":"After reading the positive reviews, we got take-out from here. Food is good for the price. 

I got the lychee lemongrass tofu which I enjoyed. Had thick slices of orange and big pieces of lychee with the tofu.

Boyfriend ordered the chicken pad thai. I tasted it but didn't really like it. 

I may or may not buy from here again."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were looking for a place that delivers in the area and we found this place!

Called and placed the order and was delivered right by 12pm when asked!

Tastes so good, the portion of food was huge! Which was also a bonus!!! 

Amazing. Also the delivery man recommended some other dishes as well, so that makes us wanna continue ordering in the future!"}
{"text":"It is very difficult to get good Thai delivery in Toronto.   Thai Lime is a nice exception to this rule. 

It is very much a Canadianized menu but there are solid glimpses of authenticity in their dishes. 

The veggies are soooooo fresh and well cooked.  I found their chicken way over cooked, but not suspect, and I will take over-cooked chicken to under-cooked any day of the week. 

This is not Pai or Khao San or the original Sukhi Thai, but it is solid and on our delivery roaster

They also get points for delivering on spicy when you ask for spicy."}
{"text":"I've ordered the dinner for two a few times and it's always been great. Tonight I tried the Curry Pad Thai, which was delicious and the Thai Noodle Soup,  which may have cured my cold.  Great prices as well!"}
{"text":"Good standard (westernized) thai food. I've only ever placed takeout orders here, so I can't speak to eating inside the restaurant. 

The have decent specials on occasion so definitely check those out. They usually come with a bunch of good stuff, and sometimes ice cream too. 

Green Curry Chicken and Red Curry Shrimp are my go-to's and are always fresh and tasty. Spring rolls are good too.

They're also great with accommodating gluten allergies. Love that!"}
{"text":"Spiffy little storefront with a full bar and pleasant service.  Prices are very reasonable and portions quite generous.  Rice is included in stir-fry dishes.

Food was tasty.  My main quibble was the use of not very authentic ingredients in some of the dishes, especially zucchini and Western broccoli."}
{"text":"This place is really good. I probably get take out here more than anywhere else. They're always on time, they always get the order right and it's always good. 

If you spend over certain amounts they give you spring rolls for free then chicken pad thai. Check it out and ask them cause sometimes they don't mention and don't give it. 

All and all, I love this place, so does everyone I know"}
{"text":"\"Would you like some fish/veg with that sauce?\" I seriously considered giving it a rinse before eating it and ended up throwing most of it out. This was my first and last time trying Thai food."}
{"text":"Based on other reviews, I had no expectations for an authentic Thai food experience. I ordered the green mango salad (which was made with ripe mangoes) and shrimp green curry (which included cauliflower and zucchini). Both were very tasty and had generous portions. They will make for good leftovers!

Despite living in the Junction, it's rainy and I'm hungover so I got delivery from OrderIt.ca and got 15% off with the Olympics code: LONDON2012GOLD 

Their menu comes with lots of good coupons, delivery is free, 15% off pick up...I will definitely be returning! And next time I'll get off my butt and walk over.

Also a sweet touch, they threw in a little bag with shrimp chips with my order."}
{"text":"Since when are completely raw green peppers and zucchini and soggy broccoli the primary vegetables in a curry?  I can only assume that is what was on sale this week."}
{"text":"This is where it's at! Spicy hot and sour soup with lots of veggies and tofu! Curry is delicious and delivery is always sooner than an hour!"}
{"text":"Just had my first bad experience. My delivery was over an hour past the estimated delivery time (which already was 1.5hrs from ordering). They were pretty decent about crediting me the meal and as a recommendation, do not use the Just East website, call them instead."}
{"text":"Came here because we just moved to the neighborhood. Pretty comprehensive menu with descent value. The food is good, the appetizer platter is well worth it. The main selling feature is how lovely and pleasant the staff are. So attentive and really wonderful. A few old drunken men, I assume because the booze is pretty cheap. They do take-out and delivery too."}
{"text":"Shockingly great! Great service, nice atmosphere, filling portions and delicious food. The area that this place is in is a little bit questionable, but after trying it we wouldn't hesitate to go back. The green mango salad was awesome!! My boyfriend didn't like the sound of it but ended up eating half of mine after tasting it! The red curry was hearty and filling, flavorful and creamy, but not too spicy. If you like it spicy, ask for extra spice ;). :The prices were really good too. We'll definitely be back and get take out from here!"}
{"text":"Best calamari in Toronto!  Seriously, if you've tried it here and think there's somewhere else better, please let me know, because I LOVE calamari!  Always come here for lunch, appetizer and lunch $9.95 (before tax and tip), it's a great price considering the quality and portion.  They also offer discount for take out and delivery if you order directly from the restaurant.  Their dishes might be a bit heavy on the sauce, I would order less sauce for take out.  Every dish I have tried (Beef Devil, Curry Chicken Fried Rice, Curry Shrimp, Mushroom Soup, Seafood Soup, etc.) is delicious.  Service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We had takeout from this joint last night for dinner. We started with the green mango salad which was pretty standard with the exception of the cashews on top which I really enjoyed. We had the calamari (very well cooked and tasty), chicken Phad Thai (very flavourful and legit), and the Golden Beef (sauce good but the beef was tough). Overall, I thought the quality was good as everything was fresh and they didn't cheap out on any ingredients. The whole thing came to $72 including delivery which doesn't seem too out of line. I would order from them again if I lived in this hood."}
{"text":"Another option for Thai in the Junction and this is a very, very good one!

Thai Lime is located in a small strip mall just east of Junction proper and there's free parking.  We arrived on a dreary Monday night to find that we had the entire place to ourselves.  Decor is clean, simple and modern.  Room was a bit echo-y because our table of 4 was the only one in there.

We ordered - tofu satay combo ($10.99), green curry shrimp ($11.49), mango tofu ($10.49), coconut tofu ($10.49).  All entrees included rice at no additional cost, which is a nice touch.

Entrees came out quickly and steaming hot.  Portions were quite generous and we had more than enough for lunch the next day.  My tofu satay was great and the peanut sauce was delish.  The veggies were a bit over sauced/peppered and starched but I can forgive it.  The green curry had a nice flavor and spice to it.

Service was friendly and she did a good job of refilling our lime infused waters.  We also received a 25% discount on our bill as their opening special.

I'm definitely a fan of Thai Lime.  Will definitely keep on my radar for both take out and eat in.  Welcome to the Junction 'hood."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed after reading all the stellar reviews. I ordered delivery and got the veg pad Thai and veg cashew pineapple coconut. I also PAID for extra peanuts on the pad Thai and cashews in the coconut dish - tell me why there were minimal! That was an extra $6!! The vegetables are clearly those thick cut ones you buy in a bag in the frozen section, not pleasant to crunch down on big vegetables that can't fit your mouth, especially in a pad Thai noodle dish. The coconut cashew sauce was heavy in pineapple and was thick. 

Spring rolls are average, peanut sauce is ok, sticky rice is ok. 

Maybe I just had a bad cook working that day but wouldn't recommend at all. 

Sorry!!"}
{"text":"Delivery was easy and really fast on just-eat. We had the green mango salad, sriracha shrimp, chicken phad thai (free with delivery!), basil beef and curry coconut vegetables.
All the food was great and will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai red curry, steamed rice and hot and sour soup! Portions are large and food is great! We called for delivery and the food was delivered in 30 mins."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto. Friendly service great food and big portions. I can say enough good things about the curry, the crispy beef is excellent and the pad Thai and pad see ew are wonderful. Great find on a bit of a sketchy strip of Dupont!"}
{"text":"My roommate and I recently did a \"pad thai crawl\" where we sampled pad thai from a few different restaurants.  This one was by far my favourite, and the best value too!  Only did takeout, so I can't attest as to the atmosphere of the restaurant, but I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Very tasty compared to most Thai places and prices are reasonable too. Thom ka  Kai is good and their Malay Curry and pad Thai too."}
{"text":"We had a light dinner a few nights ago. we ordered 2 soups, fresh rolls and the wings. The soups were fantastic; I really enjoy their chicken coconut soup, it's my favourite thing on the menu. the wings were a bit small, but tasty and came with a tasty salad as the garnish.

So why a 3 star review? The utterly horrible fresh rolls. It was huge, in a bad way. mostly overstuffed with shredded iceberg lettuce, to the point it overwhelmed all the other components in it. It was impossible to eat, bland from lettuce overload, and it always fell apart because each piece couldn't fit in your mouth in one bite. But my main issue was the fact it had clearly been made ages before, the pastry had started to dry and harden.  It was poorly put together by someone whom I suspect had never made a fresh roll before. I will not order it from them ever again. But as long as the soups stay consistent,  I will go back."}
{"text":"We've just moved neighbourhoods, and have been in search for a new Thai place. Thai Lime was disappointing.

Ordered the Veggie Spring Rolls, Green Curry Chicken, Red Curry Beef and Chicken/Shrimp Pad Thai. We got delivery, and the only plus of the whole meal was that the food arrived quickly and hot.

Overall, the dishes were mediocre -  very westernized and not at all authentic Thai.

Spring Rolls were OK - not much flavour, but they were hot, and packed full of veggies and glass noodles.

Asked for both curries to be \"very spicy\" as I find most Thai places go easy on the spice unless you ask. Unfortunately, both were bland. Full of veggies, which were soggy, and the red curry had potatoes in it - NOT traditional red curry at all. They did include a very small container of chili oil, but that is never the same as cooking the dish with spice from the start.

The Pad Thai was the best of the dishes, but still did not satisfy the craving for great Thai food.

The search continues...."}
{"text":"We had a relatively late night craving for Thai food so searched Yelp and found Thai Lime open and within driving distance. We ordered the cold spring rolls, red curry beef, mango salad and beef skewers.

Thai food can be hit and miss so my expectations weren't too high but I was very impressed with the flavor. The beef curry was very tasty with good pieces of beef versus sinewy, low quality cuts like some places. The beef skewers were tender and spicy and their mango salad was fresh. Their cold spring rolls are actually much larger in diameter than Vietnamese rolls and very fresh as well.  

I'd say that this would be a safe bet for a go-to take out place for sure."}
{"text":"It pains me to contradict other Yelpers, since their reviews are what prompted me to pass by Thai Lime today.  I *have* to Yelp about this place, otherwise some other Yelp chump will be tempted to make the same mistake that I made for 30+ dollars today.

~~~
best parts: the anticipation of a great lunch.  Ready for pick-up in 15 minutes.

the reality: disappointment.

Items ordered:
*pad thai (tolerable);
*lychee and lemongrass tofu (almost ok but broccoli and cauliflower were very wilted and non-crunchy, signs that this dish was made well in advance - maybe even a week+ ago);
*veg. spring rolls (soggy, but okay if you got them for free.  ex: for $20 delivery, you'll get a free order of spring rolls);
*mango salad (mango was cut into thick French fry like pieces.  Taste was o.k. but nevertheless not what one would normally expect from a \"Thai\" restaurant);
*hot and sour soup.  $5.99 that I'll never get back.  Not sure which taste direction they were aiming for, but the soup tastes literally hot and sour, and doesn't have any flavour beyond that.  

I grew up with members of my family working in the restaurant business and I also grew up with regular exposure to Thai food.  My standards are likely different from others who are o.k. with generic/non-authentic Thai food.

The average person probably not have an issue with this place, especially if that person is concerned with the food being \"Thai\" and not specifically authentically Thai.

(side note: hair nets weren't used in the prepping of the food -- we found two short white human hairs in our food).

Two safer bets for those interested in authentic Thai food would be:
Pi Tom's (south of Wellesley stn; 6 Alexander St);
and Real Thailand (west of Spadina stn; 350 Bloor Street West).
Even \"Thai Country Kitchen\" at 412 Spadina Ave in Kensington Market, has much better Thai food.

The people working at those places actually speak Thai, and likely grew up exposed to how authentic Thai food should taste.

There is only one \"Thai\" restaurant that I found to be worse than Thai Lime so far, and that's \"Just Thai\" at 534 Church St.  The pad thai was so sweet and unusual/thick in sauce, I actually had to send it back.  There was nobody Thai in sight.  It was just another trendy restaurant that caters to mainstream folk who are perfectly satisfied if not happy with a restaurant defining to them what \"Thai\" food should be.

I'm passionate about some foods, and will go the distance to support a good dish.
By the same token, I feel passionately Disappointed in today's meal and obviously will not be back at Thai Lime.  Ever."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out Pad Thai for lunch - it seems the time-of-day and chef on duty matters. Still not bad, but the balance of flavours wasn't there - A little bland and a touch ketchup-y.

Just thought I should revise, because it seems it's not always worth going out of your way for. Sometimes it's just okay."}
