{"text":"Honestly, I've been to a couple of sushi places, but this is the spot!  The atmosphere is great and the food is even better.    Make a reservation and try to sit at the bar and get to know the artist that creat your dishes. The food is as wonderful as they are.   Go NOW!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service made you feel right at home. The Christmas tree is a must! The place is often quite busy, so call ahead and reserve. Also enjoyed the Michael Jackson roll. The sushi is super fresh, and the rolls are creative. All the staff are friendly. Overall a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The Christmas trees are a fantastic mix which are a real highlight. Every time we went we would get a tasting menu, we were never disappointed and it was consistently some of the best sushi I have had."}
{"text":"This is definitely very unique. Their sushi menu is quite interesting and stands out from many other sushi restaurants because they are creative. I didn't like the creativity as much as I thought I would because I expected authentic Japanese when I visited. They definitely had some delicious rolls, but if you're looking for authentic sushi, this might not be the best place to go for that. On the other hand, if you want to have sushi and you're not the biggest fan of raw fish, this might be better for you.  They have a tasting menu that's not on their menu, so make sure to ask your server about it if your'e interested - I had the tasting menu, and I think it's worth a try, because you get a lot more than ordering a la carte.  Overall, I had great service and I had a great dinner date with my husband. Though it didn't have a lot of variety in their fish, it was a unique experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious fusion creations. Staff is amazing, the place was packed with a long lineup, but they still managed to quickly walk us through the menu and making us laugh and then getting the tables ready for the other groups in jovial mood, and then coming back to us with each plate along with a brief presentation. Kitschy and smallish place but the atmosphere is really nice and the lack of space makes it cozier with good company."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente et très bon service. L'ambiance est de plus vraiment sympa avec une bonne sélection musicale ! Le menu dégustation était parfait pour première visite."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sushi place in Montreal. The service is great too. I told them my allergies and they were very accommodating. Get the taster platter. You'll get a bit of everything. It's delicious and filling!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp reviews; however was sadly disappointed. If you know your sushi, don't come here.   If you're into non-authentic \"creative\" sushi with a focus on rolls rather than quality of fish, then this is the place for you!  We ordered the tasting menu ($23.50/person):   Sashimi 3.5/10: served with thinly cut apple and home made sauce (vinegary/sake sauce). Very very thin slices of fish. Again, if you want quality fish, this is not the place. The sauce that it was soaked in saved the dish.  Lobster bits on rice cracker (6/10): not sure what the actual name of this is (look at pics I posted) not bad but nothing special.   Assorted rolls (Madonna, Michael Jackson, 2 other rolls) (6/10): you get 3 rolls of each kind per person. The best one was probably the Michael Jackson, but maybe because it was fried so had a bit of texture. Other rolls were okay. I can give brownie points for creativity (one roll was wrapped in Vietnamese rice paper instead of seaweed, the other was wrapped in cucumber).   This restaurant is for those not into authentic sushi (ie. Fresh quality sashimi) this restaurant is for those who enjoy gimicky rolls with random stuff (like enoki mushrooms wrapped in cucumber).  Meh."}
{"text":"So so so good! I'm visiting from Winnipeg, where we are fortunate to have some really good sushi options. This place did not let me down! Wow. My favorite was the Madonna and Spicy Salmon. My husband loved the Bob Marley. We will definitely be back again (and likely this trip!)."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic, intimate, new sushi restaurant in Montreal.  It will be on our regular rotation from now on.  It's a different twist on sushi, but with all of the familiar fish and flavors.  The owners really believe in quality over all-you-can-eat quantity, but you won't go away hungry.  The fish is fresh, expertly served, and so tasty you'll find yourself pushing away the usual soy sauce and wasabi accompaniments (says a wasabi fiend).  The rolls are inventive, and the chef has a lot up his sleeve. Among the pleasant surprises: The sashimi with apples plate is similar to a carpaccio (thin slices of fish in a dressing with julienned apples) and the 'christmas trees' are kind of a spicy lobster tartare. Also, the regular scallop sashimi slices were served between lime slices, giving it a slight citrus flavor, which was refreshing paired with the yogurt/coconut milk dipping sauce.  All this for about $25 pp.  We were hesitant to try the chef's choice prefix menu, but I will choose it without hesitation next time."}
{"text":"I have tasted the future of sushi, and it is Saint Sushi Bar. Both delicious and beautiful, you will not walk out of there disappointed or hungry. I would absolutely recommend going."}
{"text":"Vraiment excellent, nous avons pris un menu pour 2 a emporter, celui ci nous a coûté 40$ soit 20$ chacun mais il était vraiment délicieux ! Nous reviendrons sans aucun doute"}
{"text":"So I came here with a friend after a long decision on where to go for dinner. We didn't make reservations but there was some open seating at the bar that we agreed to. This was the best choice because we got to meet some great sushi chefs behind the bar. The sushi chef(Alex)that served us was really great. He gave us delicious recommendations(tasting for 2). This is honestly the best sushi we have had yet. We highly recommend to get the tasting. You get a little sample of what the menu has to offer. If not, then you should at least get the christmas trees. I could eat these for days. Everyone that works there is very pleasant and have great attitudes. By the way, the music they played this evening was on point and straight from the 90s! Such a great atmosphere here!"}
{"text":"It's called sushi bar but they don't serve alcohol!! That's indeed the perfect sushi for those who doesn't know what sushi is all about. It's an American and not a Japanese sushi place. it's the equivalent of going to pizza hat to eat pizza . those creations such as the Maki rolls with funny names and the Christmas tree are made of yesterday's or probably last 3 days fish leftovers with plenty of aroma and spices to mask the freshness of the fish or the lack of it in this case, I have spent enough time in Japan to know what I'm talking about. One other thing;the interior design  is awful , touristic peaces from Thailand mixed with an ugly painting of a Spanish Taurus fighter with golden frame !!. Now the worst of all is that the chefs are using bare hands to prepare food and one can see them touching their mouth or nose , one of them actually sneezed. however the service is good and the manager is friendly and that's why I added one more star . But never again it's really my and my group worst experience of eating sushi in Montreal"}
{"text":"Delicious flavorful sushi with great textures. Friendly service. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great quaint sushi restaurant. Staff is super friendly courteous and the atmosphere more than makes up for the fact that there is no alcohol (none served, none allowed). Tasting menu was great - only part lacking was the fried \"Micheal Jackson\" tasted powdery, like the flower wasn't well mixed, so didn't enjoy it as much as I would have, had it been prepared better (might have been avoided if the chefs had tasted it occasionally). But besides that, would recommend and would go back! Definitely! Ps: Make reservations! Place is packed."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with saint sushi. The food itself deserved at very most a 3-star review but the rudeness of the owner/chef just blew me away. I am an avid Montreal eater and have worked in the food industry for over 10 years and have never faced such defensive behaviour. I ordered the salad, which on the menu said contained julienned papayas, and when I inquired with the very polite waiter about it, the owner blew up at me from across the kitchen and said \"I decided not to put them in.\" When I gently replied that they should perhaps warn their customers that the menu has changed, he snapped at me making all sorts of random excuses. I said ok, no problem and continued eating. He shouted, again from across the restaurant that he would remove 1$ off our 47$ bill. Ok. We said ok. After the bill was paid, he continued harassing me, questioning my knowledge of the restaurant industry and attacking me with snarky comments. This is not acceptable. I could not believe it. I will not condone this behaviour from a restaurant and I pity the staff who need to work with this overblown ego of a man. As for the food, the salad was sopping in sauce, she sushi was no better than anywhere else, and the bill was 47$ for two people, for lunch. Go if you like, but I would stand in solidarity against such a vicious place."}
{"text":"Wow...thank you bro for the recommandation...the Bob Marley and lobster christam tree are the bomb"}
{"text":"Enfin un restaurant de sushis qui change du traditionnel sushi aseptisé qu'on trouve à chaque coin de rue! Les produits sont excellents, la soupe miso et les sashimis à tomber, la déco de bric et de broc assez folle et chaleureuse, l'ambiance en cuisine (ouverte) fort sympathique (les cuistos chantaient quand nous sommes passés). Bref, on a passé une bonne soirée et je recommanderais l'endroit. MAIS j'ai tout de même un bémol: nous avons pris le menu dégustation que nous nous sommes partagés à trois... et même si c'est très original, j'ai personnellement eu le sentiment que tous nos sushis se ressemblaient :("}
{"text":"Get the tasting menu. This is not your classic boring rolls, and probably not authentic, but very creative and tasty stuff and I always leave here satisfied. It can be a bit tricky to get a table, especially if you're more than two people. Service is very attentive. I recommend this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Saeng makes some of the best sushi I've ever tried and everyone in the restaurant is phenomenally friendly and understanding of all needs of their customers (allergies, etc.). Always fresh and innovative"}
{"text":"Bon mais le menu dégustation n'était pas assez copieux à mon goût. J'aurais dû prendre une soupe en entrée en plus. Les sashimis aux pommes au premier service étaient minuscules et il n'y avait pas assez de makis pour deux personnes selon moi. Aussi j'aime les sushis plus classiques. Excellent service et bonne ambiance."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Service is excellent so nice and generous with the fish would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the visual was amazing, All french on the menu so was hard to understand, however the staff there was so kind helped and cared of us (Not only us she is just the best! haha). If you want to try new sushi, I strongly recommend here"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend and looking for a great sushi place. After reading the reviews here, we decided to try Saint Sushi Bar on 8/30/2014. I'm a bonafide sushi-snob, but I can honestly say that this sushi is the best I've ever eaten. Hands down. The Tasting Menu was recommended to us and it's by far one of the best decisions of my life. The sushi was fresh, and the flavors were unbelievable. The chefs can accommodate most palates in the tasting menu. We decided to try raw and non-raw options. Included in the tasting menu was also a salad and another starter (can't remember the name, but they are pictured here on Yelp--the little thingys on crackers). The chefs were a lot of fun too (shout out to Ralph) and it's obvious that they put a lot of detail into the sushi and most of all enjoy what they do.   I also enjoyed the music that was playing too. Ralph told me it was a collection of all the chefs playlist-so you will hear old-school, new school and everything in between. It really makes for fun experience. Will definitely go back when I return to Montreal."}
{"text":"My fiance and I just moved to the Plateau from Boston and were told by friends to check this place out.  We were not disappointed!  The food and service are amazing and the chef/owner offered us a chef's tasting.  It was perfect.  I've since ordered take out and it's been wonderful also.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Montreal hands down. Everything is flavored just right and is super fresh. They are also very accommodating with regards to food allergies."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the special that was some appetizers and a couple rolls (They speak English but I didn't catch what I was ordering). The whole atmosphere in there is really fun it seats only less than 30 people but don't let that sway you. Reservations should be made. Anytime I'm back in Montreal I will be eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"C'est mon amie qui m'a introduit à Saint Sushi et depuis, j'ai toujours envie de sushis que de chez eux. Ils font des sushis, ma foi, exquis! Avec des noms originaux comme Bob Marley, Madonna, Michael Jackson, tu trouveras ton paradis de sushi. Avec des sapins de Noël (un délicieux tartare de saumon sur une croustille de riz), des  sashimis diviiiins, des makis merveilleux, c'est une explosion de saveurs dans la bouche qui te fait du bien dans le coeur.  Ah, et les chefs me reconnaissent maintenant tellement que j'y vais souvent. Pour emporter ou à la table c'est toujours un plaisir et un excellent service! :)"}
{"text":"Family of 5 came here and ordered the tasting menu. It was phenomenal. Not only was the sushi the best we've had in our lives, but the service was extraordinary. I highly recommend the tasting menu. And it's often crowded here, but well worth it. Best sushi I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant in Montréal!  I've been here a total of about 8-10 times and never been disappointed.  Awesome menu, awesome decor , PHENOMENAL staff all around. The management / owner is so passionate about the restaurant and it really shows.   During the busier days would definitely recommend calling in advance for a reservation.  Ps don't be shy to sit at the bar, the chefs are so fun and it's awesome to see them do what they do best!   Food: 10/10 Decor: 10/10 Service: 10/10"}
{"text":"The tasting menu is great and reasonable price. Everything was fresh and unique. Friendly stuff. Great area to explore around."}
{"text":"This is just a copy of Tri Express. Same menu, same price. Even the omokase (which means \"chef's choice menu\") is the same! It's not the chef choice, it's Tri's choice. Just go to the original one if you like this kind of sushi.  In either places, after the tasting menu we were still hungry. Everything taste the same with the rice crispy mix which is good but after eating the same thing in every order, we kind of got sick of it.  Also, if you are looking for an authentic japanese sushi place, this is not the place either.  In the end, I'd rather either go to a cheaper sushi place or save my money for the authentic one."}
{"text":"Found this delicious sushi place on yelp. Was visiting Montreal with our 4 mo. old baby girl; needed to go to places that were only kid-friendly. I wouldn't say this place is necessarily spacious enough to bring in a stroller, buuut the staff at this restaurant were amazing and more than accommodating for all that came in with us. Unfortunately, neither my hubs or I are fluent in French (and they only have a French menu), but the waiter that served us gave us some of his top recs and we ended up going with the tasting menu. Hands down, it was delicious!! Would highly recommend!! Great service, delicious food. Best restaurant we visited during our stay."}
{"text":"Les sushi sont tres bons, le gout est special:) Par contre je le trouve un petit peu cher pour la quantite."}
{"text":"Tasting menu at $22 per person was absolutely fantastic! Let the chef take control, it's the way to go. Fresh ingredients, well-presented, and the staff were super friendly and efficient. As mentioned in other reviews we loved the music, as well. The perfect summer treat in a really cool neighborhood. Can't praise this place enough!"}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by Saint Sushi Bar. This is not your typical sushi restaurant. It is like sushi and fusion food mixed together in the best possible way. I got the tasting menu and shrimp tempura. The shrimp tempura was incredible it came with a sweet sauce and wasn't to greasy tasting. The sashimi was not to my taste because i did not like the sauce it was smothered and the miso soup was kind of bland. Get the Christmas tree. It is some kind of seafood tower on a rice cracker and is delicious. The sushi is incredible ~ the best in the city. Try everything and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The best sushi I've ever had. Delicious. Creatively crafted and beautifully presented. Excellent, friendly service. All at an exceptional price. The space is simple, nothing fancy, but the food is spectacular. Highly recommend their tasting menu, it's an awesome dining experience and a bargain too."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for Valentine's Day after reading so many great reviews about this place and it definitely held up to the expectations. Food is fresh and delicious and the service is absolutely fabulous. My girlfriend and I have had sushi in many different countries and this is by far one of the best places we have ever been to. As suggested by many, we had the sampler menu (which is not actually on the written menu) and trust us (or the many other reviewers) that will totally hit the spot and will go far beyond the expectations.  Highly recommend it :D"}
{"text":"Food is amazing and the service was even better! Definitely recommend the tasting menu for first timers."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, great food, great sushi with a twist.  We highly recommend this place if you like sushi. Do not go for the traditional boring sushi places. Instead come here for sushi with great flavor and a new style. We both really enjoyed the food and the interaction with the friendly staff.  We went here three times. Once around 9:30 pm on a Wednesday which we were able to get a seat right away even though the place was packed. Then again the next night around the same time, but this time we could not get a seat and there was a 45 min wait for a to-go order due to how busy they were. So, we came back on Friday at 4:30 pm to make sure we could get a seat. The early Friday visit was the best since the place was not busy and we could talk with the staff. The staff here enjoys what they are doing and wants you to enjoy what you are eating. Let them know a little about what you are looking for and they can customize your sushi to make sure you love it. Notes: Make a reservation and start with an order of the \"tasting menu\""}
{"text":"Ignore the decor and order the tasting menu - just amazing. The furniture looks like something out of \"The Krusty Krab\" but it ends up just letting you know you are in on the joke. This is not some hi-tech, over conceptualized sushi bar. It's a bunch of people who are passionate in what they do and their love is reflected in every dish. They couldn't be more helpful, service was thoughtful and timely. Will defiantly go back and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"great service, loved the sushi! best bang for buck Sushi ive been to in Montreal...thanks for the staff for being kind and explaining what the meal was...got the Tasting one..."}
{"text":"This place changed my life! Within being in Montreal for 5 minutes we went straight to Saint Sushi because of the many awesome reviews!  Great service and FRESH sushi! We did the tasting and it was quite a journey of deliciousness! The \"Christmas Trees\" were SO good, I've never had anything like it! We had the Michael Jackson roll, Madonna roll and the Sansei roll, they were out of this world!!! The tasting menu was $22 per person and was well worth it!   We will be going back before we leave!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!   Terrific food and a wicked staff that genuinely care about providing you with a great dining experience!   You'll love the tasting menu and the funky music."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I'm a bit of a sushi snob I admit, but I loved loved looooved this place. Every roll was so good and I love the tasting menu concept! Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Tried the tasting menu.  I really liked the Christmas tree.  Sushi was great, but not in blowing.  We get such great and fantastic sushi in Toronto that I think it's hard to beat but wanted to give this place a try seeing so many reviews on yelp.  The rolls very definitely fresh and tasted great.  I don't think they have a lot of variety,  I can see some sort of similarity between the rolls.  I also noticed that they do not use to much rice in there Maki rolls, which isn't a bad thing.  People are very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Great sushi, loved the tasting menu. Excellent staff, fun music, good vibe, great value!"}
{"text":"Again I was not disappointed at Saint Sushi. Always fresh and the staff is so friendly! See you on my next trip. The Caribbean Queen!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place! The vibe is amazing. It's on one of my favourite streets in Montreal. It's a small restaurant, but super cozy. The menu is creative and the food is delicious. I sat at the tables one and another time at the bar. When we sat at the bar, we had the tasting menu. Highly recommended if you just want to go in and try a bunch of different things. The sushi chefs were super friendly, were having a great time and their energy totally rubbed off on us.   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Dope food. Great fun and chill vibes. Will be back! Order the degustation course (not in menu)"}
{"text":"Took the tip off of yelp and the reviews were spot on. Great fusion of music and sushi topped off with a great staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Outstanding sushi!  Both standard fare and items off the beaten path.  Try the Chef Special or Tasting menu. Not what I expected when I walked into this place."}
{"text":"first meal in Montreal. very nice people there, Xmas tree sushi was very special. everything else tasted pretty much the same."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. Amazing.   It's been so long since I've been so pleased with a dining experience. The tastes and presentation were spectacular.  And on top of that the service was awesome. Friendliest group of people.   I came in starving and left overwhelmingly happy.  Sushi will never be the same to me."}
{"text":"Our only night in Montreal we decided to go here. It was super busy but the service was awesome! They knew exactly what they were talking about and recommended great plates. We got the sampler plate and Adam? I think it was called. So delicious. And with the exchange rate it was super cheap for a lot of good quality sushi! Definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and we enjoyed the food very much here. We had the sampling menu and the Christmas tree sushi was absolutely delicious. The salmon sashimi was amazing as well. Well the entire meal was great. If you're feeling for sushi, do be sure to check this place out and try it out. If possible, make reservations cause they do get busy!"}
{"text":"Amazing and unique.  Don't go there expecting to eat a cookie-cut California roll. Sit at the sushi bar if you can and order what the chef recommends for you. Very friendly group of individuals who love what they do. :) Loved it!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this  tiny place and the tasting menu. Very friendly staff and a cool variety of rolls. PS: The Christmas trees are amazing."}
{"text":"Amazing. So delicious. I wanted to go back the next day and am so sad I don't live in Montreal to go regularly!!  I'm from New Jersey and I am an avid sushi eater (when I can and when it isn't so expensive). I noticed a review from a New Yorker (some of the best sushi in America can be found there) so I had a hunch we would find something great. My boyfriend and I stopped in Montreal for one night on a road trip and, boy, did we choose the right place. (Thank you yelp and Mike D!!)  Innovative, flavorful, meticulously crafted food. Friendly, passionate, happy, local chef and workers. Not really cheap, not really expensive - for example, the bf and I got the sampler so it was expensive but we got a massive amount of DELICIOUS, mouth-watering food.   Side note: Got to talking to the chef and employees after we ate because we ended up eating until after closing. The chef has traveled a lot, including to Jamaica, using his travels and sort of, let's say, meditative, spiritual beliefs to influence and bring passion to his food. All the people that work there are family or long-time friends. AND they offered to show us a good local bar to go to afterwards for our one and only night in Montreal.  All in all a great local establishment you really want to support, and when you do you get the benefits of incredible food."}
{"text":"Creative, tasty food (get the tasting menu). Awesome service. Will be back every time I come to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Omg I heard a lot about it.  First of all, amazing staff. Super chill and relax. Beautiful.  We went for the Chef selection and omgogmg.  It came with the Christmas tree weee. Lobster one. AMAZING woooow.  Freaking tower of juicy lobby meat. The waiter came with a big plate of special sushi and explained us how it works and which sauce goes with what.  If you have only had sushi from sushi shop or all you can eat, this is from another level. Each bite was amazing. Definitely a must go.  Good place for a date. Good experience."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi! Loved the sauces that you can have with it for dipping. The spicy tuna was spicy and delicious. I would crave this place if l lived here!"}
{"text":"I would give it a 10 on 5 if I could for multiple reasons.   The food was out of this world...melt in your mouth good. The best sushi I have had in Montreal ever.   We were a larger group and had two kids with us. They were ok with the kids having outside food knowing that they couldn't eat raw fish. They also made veggie makis for the kids that they loved.   Service was great, although it took some time to get the order written down. Mainly because it was packed, not because the server was slow.   Ambiance was amazing, the music was great (90's hiphop), and the food was plentiful...  A must visit."}
{"text":"Walking around Montreal on a very cold day, we were jonesin' for some great sushi. This place was just around the corner from where we were at the time. Gorgeous interior with a more than friendly staff. We started off with the miso soup, which had an exquisite twist. You could definitely tell it was made from scratch. The we split 3 sushi rolls for the main course. One was a veggie roll, the other a Madonna roll, and the last was a tuna and salmon combo. All three were so different from each other, but we couldn't decide which one we liked best, they were all equally superb. The staff was extremely accommodating, as we had one in our party with an allergy to almost everything ever. Extremely friendly staff. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"En voyant les avis déjà laissés, je me doutais que j'allais me régaler. Ce que je ne savais pas, c'est que tous les autres restaurants japonais allaient désormais devenir fades pour moi ! :)  De passage un soir, il n'y avait plus de place pour manger sur place. Nous décidons donc de prendre à emporter et d'aller manger le tout dans un parc pas très loin (oui c'était en plein été !) Je reste toujours très basique d'habitude, à savoir je prends des makis ou california au saumon, des sushis saumon. Alors lorsque j'ai vu la carte hyper originale je ne savais pas quoi faire ! Et j'ai décidé de me laisser tenter et surprendre par le menu Dégustation, qui proposait un assortiment d'un peu tout. Et là, wahou ! Déjà la présentation était très jolie, mais c'était aussi un véritable festival pour mes papilles ! J'ai TOUT aimé. Mention spéciale aux \"sapins de Noël\".  Originalité, savoureux, fraicheur, voilà mon avis résumé en 3 mots !"}
{"text":"Great sushi and great service! Very accommodating for a gluten free diet. Try the red tuna and bob marley rolls!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi.  Great environment, and really nice staff. This place did not disappoint.  Shared several rolls, all were high quality.  The Tupac spicy tuna roll was particularly good."}
{"text":"The best meal of my trip to Montreal. Food made with soul, super affordable, great prices. The Christmas Tree is a thing of beauty. Super unpretentious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tres bon et  produits frais de qualites, belle ambiance typique du plateau. Un des meilleurs resto a sushi de la ville sans hesitation!"}
{"text":"Don't overwhelm the chef he doesn't want to receive all the orders at once. If so the service is slower . Food is amazing good experience"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great service. Better than Tri Express in my opinion. Will definitely go back! Probably the best value for sushi in Montreal."}
{"text":"I visited saint sushi bar yesterday for the first time and was blown away by the incredible staff and delicious sushi!  We sat down and were treated to a platter of salmon in an amazing sauce with julienne apple on top - at first I was skeptical to try but the flavour blew me away. We continued with a bowl of hot miso which was filled with vegetable goodies, followed by the tasting platter ($22p/p + tip). To finish our amazing experience we enjoyed a lot of green tea while singing and dancing with the fabulous team at Saint Sushi!  Can't wait to head back there soon"}
{"text":"Such amazing sushi, they don't skimp on the fish offerings like a lot of sushi places where you get like a tiny sliver of fish and spend over 10 bucks on the roll. They serve a fair portion.  Great for a date or just a casual dining experience as well :)"}
{"text":"What can I say, this place is a little unorthodox as far as a sushi restaurant goes but it lacks NOTHING. Inside is a vibrant energy with the head chef and operates by a family of close childhood friends beside him... super tasty rolls named \"the Michael Jackson\" and \"the Madonna\" will keep you wanting more. What a great place and bravo to the friends that make it such... 6 stars!"}
{"text":"This place provides a liberal take on Sushi. They have quite interesting appetizers including salmon and tuna in reduced sake sauce that is served with apples, and their signature Christmas trees which are basically  see food pâtés that are served on rice crackers.   The sushis on the other hand are infused with a mayonnaise based filling that literally makes them taste exactly the same. I would say that from sushi, only an idea is preserved."}
{"text":"My wife and I met Saeng since he worked for chef Tri. As much as we love Tri Express,  saint sushi bar's easily becoming our favorite. Some says it's the same but I think it has different takes from Tri. Sauce is different and the fish quality is a top notch. Now if you enjoy more all you can eat sushi, then you may not leave feeling full but your money is worth spent.  On top of he makes the best sushi in town, me and my wife really enjoy the warmth greets from him n his team and the playlist from the 80s album. Something that Tri is missing. I highly recommend to try this modern sushi place. And try to come on weekdays to avoid long queue or call to reserve.  Le meilleur sushi moderne en ville.  Frais et plein de saveur!"}
{"text":"Saint sushi bar serves very good sushi.  We took the tasting menu, which consists of a three service meal. The first service was tuna and salmon sashimi. The fish was very fresh! The second service was the popular Christmas trees. Once again the fish was very fresh, but not a huge fan of the crackers they used. And the last service was different types of makis. It was good but a bit disappointing to be honest. They put tempura in all of their makis which, let's be real, kinda sucks! Also, since there was tempura in everything it felt like we didn't have enough variety!  The service was very very good ! Everyone was very attentive to our needs, and since we were sitting at the bar, the chefs were keeping us entertained !"}
{"text":"This was a really unique, and fun Sushi experience.  We had the tasting menu for 2 and got to try a variety of different items. Everything that came out was delicious! The rolls were unique and different from what I've had elsewhere.  We were sitting at the bar and I loved watching the chefs assemble all the sushi!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This has become my #1 favourite sushi I've been to ever! What an experience and I recommend the tasting menu! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place I've been. Music is awesome, very chill R&B music playing and just a fun hipster atmosphere, come here,  you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Great ambiance. The chefs at the bar are cool and play great music. Lot of hip hop. The decor is Laotian? Lao? Owners are from Laos. Incredibly friendly. Oh ya, and the sushi is very good. Not incredible, but very good especially for Montreal standards. My favorite part of the meal were the Xmas rolls."}
{"text":"Great spot. Extremely attentive waitress who was accommodating with all dietary restrictions. Awesome music. Fun vibe."}
{"text":"Wow, it's like Vancouver in Montreal (or at least the closest we're gonna get)! The sushi here is creatively prepared beautifully presented, tastes great and is amazingly affordable. As a friend of mine says \"every time I pay I feel like I'm stealing\".  On Saturday I ate at Saint Sushi for the first time and loved it so much that on Sunday evening I went back for takeout. Both times we ordered the chefs tasting menu which seems to be the way to go. Everything was excellent, the stand outs were the Christmas Tree and the Michael Jackson Maki Roll.   You really can't go wrong at this low key resto with friendly staff  and sushi rolls with names like Madonna and Bob Marley. And if for some crazy reason you don't enjoy yourself it will have only cost you $20 so, not much harm done."}
{"text":"I have never had such good sushi in my life. this place is so innovative and unique. Got the tasting menu and it was $22 per person.  Started with the salad (diced apples and thinly sliced salmon and tuna) - divine!  Next up with Christmas trees ..tuna and lobster tartare on a small rice cracker. I wish I could eat all four and leave nothing for my table - mate. LOL  Lastly, the grand finale.. 14 pieces of Maki.  4 different types of roles and each of them very unique and different. I wish I could get more but they were filling.   Definitely an indulgence but totally worth it!  wow. Cannot get over it!"}
{"text":"WHY is SAINT sushi the BEST restaurant IN MONTREAL????  I have been to saint sushi a few times. I always sat at the mini bar and the reason why is what im about to explain. First of all, let me tell you all that i've been doing a business/ branding course and in that course we were asked to name the busineses that most inspired us and WHY. That is when i realised why i love so much to eat at Saint sushi: not only the food is AMASING, but the staff there is what makes me come back again and again. Each and every one of the staff members are unic in thier own way. They make you feel as authentic as them.  They are the cherry on the sunday, they are the brand themselves. Every time i go eat there, something different occures and we always leave with a big smile, a happy stomach, good memories and anxious to come back! thanks to every single member of the crew for making this experiences so special and to make me feel at home every-single-time. I dont remember the names of everyone but special thanks to Ralf, Saeng, et Aenoy."}
{"text":"This casual sushi place is unlike most sushi restaurants. A very casual ambiance with a mix of eclectic decor. It feels like a small local neighbourhood joint more than a asian-style traditional sushi place.   The menu is straight forward with a selection of signature rolls and a few tasting combos. We sat at the bar and tried the tasting menu - salmon sashimi, followed by Christmas trees (salmon and tuna tartare on a rice cracker shaped like a pyramid), and a sampler of rolls. The sushi were creative and visually interesting. There was not as much whole fish pieces to my liking in the rolls, but overall the flavour was on point. The variety of sushi was good, no two rolls had the same wrapping. The place only sits a few so make sure you call ahead if you're heading during dinner time."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here ever since I looked through the reviews on yelp. It's a small restaurant which boasts a very hip and laid back vibe. It was very busy and packed inside but that didn't stop us from enjoying ourself. The waiter was extremely friendly and helpful upon ordering. We were two people and ordered 3 tasters. Sushi was unique and original- I loved the melange of fruits and fish in each roll. We left full, satisfied and I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A new Sushi spot on Duluth!  A word of warning, don't go expecting your traditional Sushi fare. There are no California or Dragon rolls on the menu.  Instead expect the unexpected. The staff has put together a menu that combines tradition with modern flair to make a fusion of tastes and flavors.  The evening menu has two chef specials, the Bonnie et Clyde.  You will get a great mix of all the offerings, including my favorite a lobster mix served on a rice cracker.  Another nice fusion is the Micheal Jackson - which is a mix of salmon, shirmp  and tuna rolled and then fried.  The staff is super energetic and passionate about what they are doing. They treat each customer warmly and will answer any questions you may have about the menu. I love supporting places that love doing what they do!  The times I've been, they have played a nice mix of 80's music and a volume that makes conversation enjoyable while still being able to groove to some old school classics.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing time. The place was overcrowded so we had to sit at the bar!!! Simply a great time! You get to discuss what to eat with the chef!!! Try the tasting menu!! One of the top Sushi in Montreal"}
{"text":"Oh, my belly is happy and so are my tastebuds. I had a wonderful lazy late lunch here with a Yelp friend today.   The experience started out wonderfully with a warm welcome from the two sushi saints...one behind the sushi bar, one serving. We went with the off-menu option of a 3-course tasting meal, which was DELICIOUS and beautifully presented and just the right size for lunch. The selections are music-inspired so be sure to ask about the story behind the names. They were happy to accommodate my dairy allergy.  The fish was all really fresh and delicious, and the rice perfectly cooked. As other reviewers have mentioned, go with an open mind because it's not traditional sushi resto fare. I'm not usually a fan of \"fusion\" cuisine, which can so often cover up the delicate flavours of tasty tasty raw fish, but not so in this case.   I'd be hard-pressed to choose a favourite. The Bob Marley roll (in a rice paper wrapper) was crunchy from cucumber and fish roe, soft from avocado and salmon, and oh so delicious. The enoki mushrooms in the Beatles roll were so cute! (Yes, I admit it's strange that I find mushrooms cute...but...there we are).   Posted prices include taxes, mes ami(e)s, so if you look up the menu online, keep that in mind. It's 15% less expensive than you think.  And yes, everybody on Yelp is right, the green tea with rice is really yummy."}
{"text":"No more BYOB. No reservations but SO worth the wait. My food companions and I drooled after each dish. Our eyes widen after each bite every single time! If you are craving for sushi, GO here! While seated, wait time wasn't lengthy. Menus can be in French or English. Even the waiters signed thank you to me in ASL!"}
{"text":"Une place de sushi non conventionnelle. On rentre dans le bar et l'ambiance est chill. Les employés sont souriants. Le service est rapide.   Le restaurant est quand même petit, alors il est peut-être mieux de prendre du take-out. Il y a une SAQ à quelques pas de là.   Les sushis sont très bons. On revient pour l'ambiance et le personnel."}
{"text":"Si seulement les clients de Saint Sushi savaient... ce restaurant est une copie conforme du restaurant Tri Express, ouvert bien avant le Saint Sushi bar. Le menu est identique... les noms des plats ont seulement changé. Il n'y aucune originalité... et aucun crédit à donner au Saint Sushi bar. Le proprio du Saint Sushi bar travaillait auparavant au Tri Express, et il a décidé de \"voler de ses propres ailes\" et s'ouvrir un restaurant... identique à celui auquel il travaillait. Ce n'est pas honnête de sa part ni originale. Il ne mérite aucune félicitation sur la créativité de son menu... Pour ma part, après avoir su cette histoire, je ne retournerai plus au Saint Sushi bar."}
{"text":"For sushi snobs out there, if you want to eat at Saint Sushi, you must come in with the mindset that this is not authentic Japanese sushi. That said, the take on the sushi, nigiri, sashimi, etc. are quite creative and quite tasty!   Boyfriend and I are from Vancouver so we know our sushi. Decided to give this place a try given the high ratings. We were able to make a reservation the day of. The staff told us on the phone that they will hold our reservations for 15 minutes, and they definitely respect that despite the many walk-ins that they have.  We had the chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed. The sashimi is served with apples for acidity, which was refreshing and opens up one's appetite. I still prefer just plain sashimi but this was a new experience. The \"sapins\" were great. Nice mix of flavours and the crispiness of the rice cracker nicely balanced out the lobster mixture. The rice cracker was also easy to hold :)  The sushi platter was thoroughly explained by the server. There was a roll which was wrapped in cucumber instead of nori, a roll wrapped with Vietnamese rice paper and another called the Michael Jackson. They were all great and also came with different dipping sauces to enlighten your palate. At the end, both of us were contently full.  The decor inside has influence from all over Asia and the open counter where all the food is prepared is probably the most relaxed and chill environment I have ever witnessed. This is a fun spot to try if you're in Montreal. Remember, have an open mind!!! And make reservations!"}
{"text":"Again, theory is confirmed, the best seat in any restaurant is at the bar. That's where the action is at!  At Saint Sushi you will not be disappointed by owner Saeng who is always having a great time, pounding out his creation one after the next. My friend and I were enjoying his humming, singing and dancing along classic hits such as \"Kiss on my List\" by Hall & Oates and \"Hypnotize\" by the one and only Notorious B.I.G.  Inside is a surreal restaurant, with a fantastic atmosphere and eclectically decorated with Laotian traditional paintings & statues, but you'll also find an Alice in Wonderland's Rabbit pendant clock, an elephant sporting a NY Yankees baseball hat, various shaped lamps and so many more items that don't quite fit together but somehow make sense here!  The menu contains an assortment of options. We went for the tasting menu which was surprisingly affordable! My favorites so far was the Christmas Tree, a conifer-like mounted mixture of lobster, tobiko, masago, scallions and bits of tempura I believe. Close second is the Beatles which is a lobster maki encased in a cucumber sheet with enoki mushrooms topped with Tuna and Salmon sashimi. The joyfully named maki rolls were actually inspired from artists that owner Saeng grew up with: Bob Marley, Madonna, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Tupac and many more - take the time to ask why and you'll chuckle.  When asked about the restaurant name, Saeng mentioned that he used to love visiting many cities outside Montreal, that always seemed to the start with 'St-Something'... hence Saint Sushi was born (St-Montreal didn't quite sound right)!  The only drawbacks of this place is that they do not have a liquor license, which is not a bad thing as you can focus on the food... and the wait time, even when you have a reservation; which is also kinda ok in case you arrive late. Otherwise, if your are in for an unconventional sushi stop, then you've found it!"}
{"text":"On s'est régalés !   Menu frais, joliment présenté et un staff souriant pour 40$ à deux (soit 20/pers.) Une très-très bonne adresse pour manger des sushis, je la recommande !"}
{"text":"tasting menu was so great...."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and refreshing. The names of the sushis cheer me up. The staff is way too friendly. I walked in feeling I knew them for years.  The music is so fun and you can tell the chefs are enjoying themselves in the kitchen.  Food is so fresh. IF it's your first time, do the tasting menu. That way you get to know what everything is because it is so far from ordinary. Eventually you'll be dreaming of Christmas Trees.  My overall happiness went up to 100% thanks to this place. I'm definitely recommending it."}
{"text":"Just the best delicious I ever tasted.  Have you ever tasted \"delicious\"? This would be the place. The Michael Jackson roll is very unique. If you have food allergies or intolerances they will happily accommodate your needs. Just simply ask with a smile. Staff is super friendly and the environment is relaxed. Music is a little loud but just enough to drown out the conversation next to you."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi restaurant where everything tasted delicious and fresh.   Their miso soup is vegetarian.   And they had one very good vegetarian roll on the menu (not your boring old avocado or cucumber roll).   My husband and brother really enjoyed their fish sushi."}
{"text":"Saint is an awesome restaurant! I've been there too many times to count and always leave happy and not with an empty wallet."}
{"text":"I tried their tasting menu. Just to get things out of the way, if you like the classics, it isn't that. It's more of a fusion kind of place. Everything was good but the highlight was the rolls. They were amazing!! Each one had a unique flavour with good ingredients. Would highly recommend this place, mainly for the rolls."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group from N.Y.where the sushi is fantastic. I have to say the food here was excellent. We all got the chef special which was a tasting and it was amazing. Also I have to commend them on the great service. I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Been eating sushi my whole life and finally tried the sushi for take out the other night.. And it is already MY FAVOURITE!!  Was definitely blown away by the quality and flavours of our meal! Ordered a tasting menu and 3 more rolls with my GF and it was the perfect amount (was approx. 65$) That's a fair price for amazing sushi in my opinion. So glad I found this spot, definitely my go to sushi spot for when I want top notch food! Never thought I would've been blown away like that.. I've had a lot of great sushi in my life but this was by far the best!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from Milwaukee but originally am from Chicago. Have tried a lot of sushi but Saint is the best. Not only is the sushi novel and great but the atmosphere is really cool. The great Yelp ratings are well deserved. Saeng the owner loves his restaurant and you can tell in the food. If I lived in Montreal I would eat there as much as possible.  Can't say enough about what a great experience i had!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Such a clean, cute, quiet nook. Staff are so sweet and they had the best sushi i've ever had."}
{"text":"Best sushi of my life. Sit at the bar if you can- they're great to sing with as they play some excellent tunes while you're eating. They know how to do sushi.  I had the tasting menu and didn't want it to end. Absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"We're from New York and I saw this restaurant on Yelp so we gave it a shot. The waiter was nice, he didn't give us the menu in English so we were clueless to begin with. The thing that set us off was the guy ringing us up, he has glasses and was very rude. He had a snappy attitude and if you were the last contact in the restaurant you generally wanted to be nice but this guy was rude about my payment and didn't say thank you and or tell us to have a goodnight. RUDE RUDE! NEVER COMING BACK HERE!"}
{"text":"Simply the best sushi in town. Will go back for sure. Very cheap also, 20$ for the tasting menu!!!"}
{"text":"Had an a-ok lunch here today. Shared a few rolls with a friend and they were all tasty.    Considering that the avocado in my rolls were brown and dotted black, and that all the rolls looked like they were slapped together by an amateur, I'd have to say presentation was lacking.   For how much it cost, I'd say it's pretty average. All in all a tasty experience, probably aided by the use of tons of mayo in their rolls."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont succulents ! Vraiment frais dans la bouche avec pleins de nouvelles saveurs que je n'ai jamais rencontrées dans les autres restaurants de sushis où jai été auparavant. Le menu est simple on ne peut pas se tromper et les noms des sushis sont très originaux! Le service est quand même rapide. L'ambiance y est chaleureuse et la musique de fond  très bonne à mon goût ! J'y retournerai ça cest sur !"}
{"text":"Tasting menu is the way to go. Best sushi I've ever had in my life. Worth a visit.   Decor was eclectic but fitting because the sushi was unlike any of the traditional roles that I have tasted."}
{"text":"The best sushi restaurant in Montreal. Don't have the expectation that you will have traditional sushi. Rather, this place serves up innovative, tasty, fusion sushi that will wow you. Still my favourite resto in MTL as a local. The servers make you feel at home and know you by name somehow time and time again. Very accommodating and helpful and extremely friendly people working here. Im a regular at saint and recommend it completely to anyone, even those that don't like sushi seem to love it here with whatever they try off the menu, just go in with an open mind. For myself, i always always recommend the tasting menu. An amazing deal at $28 tax and tip inclu. Per person and the assortment of rolls always fills you up and satisfies! Simply the best resto in mtl."}
{"text":"Top chefs Guys are super cool Went in May 2015 They remember clients  Went back in December 2015 and he remembered me Tasting menu is great! Price/quality is top, cheaper than all you can eat Best sushis in town"}
{"text":"Fabulous unique sushi. Get the sampler. Celebrated our 20th anniversary with the kids here. Enjoyed."}
{"text":"This place serves the best sushi I've ever had. The fish is always super fresh, and the rolls are brilliantly creative and incredibly tasty. Plus, the staff are some of the nicest, warmest and most genuinely welcoming folks I've ever encountered in a resto. They're super passionate and enthusiastic about what they do too, which really heightens both the food and the experience overall. My only complaint is that the place gets PACKED, and it necessarily takes a while to get food when it does, even if you're just getting takeout, and there isn't even room to stand around while you wait when it fills up like that (most evenings). Still, if you can sneak in when it's quieter, it's one of the best places to eat in the city, and for a fraction of the price of comparatively impressive sushi places."}
{"text":"Oh man. tl;dr: IT'S AWESOME GO EAT THERE. (more detailed post below)  Ok to preface, I'm from Vancouver and we have a TON of amazing sushi, so my standards are crazy high. I've been living in Montreal for a year now, and honestly this city has the worst sushi I've ever had, in regards to quality and price. Just isn't worth it.  Unfortunately, I NEED to eat sushi in order to be truly happy, so we decided to check Yelp and see what Montrealers thought was best, and this place was on top.   I was a cook for many years so I know to take Yelp reviews with a grain of salt, as sometimes peoples standards are low, or a number of factors, and I've been disappointed before.   Anyway, apparently you should have reservations at this place which we were not aware, but the man who greeted us was super friendly and willing to accommodate and suggested we sit at the bar, no problem!  We poked around the menu and my boyfriend asked what our server preferred to eat (boyfriend is sushi noob) and he suggested we try their tasting menu, $22 per person, sure why not!  We usually spend around $40 for enough for both of us on crap delivery sushi, so it couldn't hurt.   First and foremost, the people that work there are awesome and it seems like they truly enjoy doing what they do. I love seeing that kind of passion in local small business.   This is not traditional sushi, but the fun fusion type, but its done very well. They know what flavours and textures compliment what.  The fish was fresh and expertly prepared, sliced properly and delicious. The rice was cooked appropriately and seasoned properly as well which is a huge deal with sushi.   They offered a variety of dipping sauces with the final platter of sushi and suggested which roll goes with which.   They were playing some fun music as well, I think the men in black theme came on during our second course, ha!   All in all a GREAT experience and I left full and impressed. Best sushi I've had in the city, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Vraiment bon sushi . Un peu cher pour la quantité  mais la qualité  est vraiment la! Nous avions pris le menu dégustation alors la prochaine fois nous sauront quoi prendre que nous avons préféré"}
{"text":"Location: Tucked away on Duluth, just off of St. Denis (head east). The closest subway is Mont-Royal or you can try your luck with street parking.  The place: Teeny tiny, but it's got BIG energy. The space is nothing fancy but it offers up a chill, comfortable vibe. The guys who run this place also have excellent taste in music so you don't need to worry about having to listen to elevator music or that pop crap.   The goods: Honestly, I could write a short novel about how goddamn good the sushi is here, but I won't. All you need to know is that SS serves up top notch cuisine using quality ingredients and everything is made upon order. I tried the tasting menu that included such goodies as the Bob Marley, the Beatles, the Madonna and the Michael Jackson, among others. The starter was salmon sashimi in a sake reduction. Jesus, it was good. Our second dish was the 'Christmas tree' - a lovely concoction of seafood served on a rice cracker. Our waiter Ali (hope I spelled that right!), told me the present wasn't on the bottom but rather, on the top - and he was right. It was so incredibly flavourful that I could feast on this alone. The grand finale was a beautiful sushi platter and every item on it rocked. Hello - can I move in?  Service: Phenomenal. Ali, Saeng, Ralph and our host whose name I unfortunately didn't get, were amazing. You can't ask for friendlier people to accompany a wonderful meal. I had a great chat with the guys and they let me know that they were basically a group of childhood friends who decided to work together. They really seem to love what they do and it's obvious that they mesh well. A huge white gangsta shout-out to these fine gents.  Price point: Super affordable - the tasting menu is $22 tax in, per person.   So... What are you waiting for? Go! But be warned - you'll need a reservation on weekends. This place is too cool for school."}
{"text":"Wow. What a place.   Clearly, a hidden gem that I gladly experienced with some local friends who knew about this awesome sushi spot.   What I really loved is how attentive the owners are to their customers. We had a few allergy issues scattered across our table, but all were accommodated by the chef.   I take it that the menu might change around somewhat frequently, but the \"tasting menu\" seems like a good option, if you want something of a surpise. If not, go for the combos they list as it's a nice cross section of their rolls and you get these awesome \"christmas trees\" which were a really nice creative and tasty highlight."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place - the quality of everything on the menu is top notch. Every roll and dish has new, interesting and diverse flavour combinations and everything tastes incredibly fresh.   I ordered the tasting menu, which costs about $25.00 and included three courses: one small sashimi plate, two \"Christmas Trees\" (lobster on a cracker; it's delicious), and a final sushi/maki plate with a selection of whatever the chef decides to put on it that night. Every single item was tasty as hell.   The service was excellent too, our waiter was friendly and explained all of the dishes to us nicely.   The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review of this place is that I was left a little hungry upon leaving. This isn't necessarily a problem, the food was amazing and I'm sure about 70% of people don't need anything more, but for $25.00, even two or three more rolls would've gone a long way to leaving me satisfied.  Overall, brilliant place. Best sushi I've had in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great little gem. Bustly, characterful, tasty, creative. Enthusiastic, dynamic & colourful team. No alcohol. Eat in or take out."}
{"text":"This is what i call perfection.  The whole experience was amazing. Personnel is very friendly, personal, engaging. The place is small and cute. Some people didn`t like the design and I liked it. It was interesting to look around. And of course, the food itself was amazing. We had a tasting menu. Apparently a tasting menu for 1 person is different from for 2 people, so if you go together take a tasting menu for 2, because it`s not enough food to share 1 tasting menu. Everything was so delicious, if I stayed longer in Montreal, I`d go back."}
{"text":"After missing my connection heading home from a week long of traveling. The only thing my girlfriend and I wanted was...bomb sushi. Found this place on Yelp and we were highly impressed!!   A hip and modern sushi bar near downtown Montreal on a busy street filled with restaurants and shops. The interior was dimly lit and just set off a cool vibe. The music really brought me back. They were playing 90's hip hop like Bone Thugs and Harmony - loved the music. Such a throwback!    Our waitress spoke great English and was overly nice to use and helped explain anything we had questions on the menu.  My girlfriend and I love sushi rolls - and that's what this place had. Lots of delicious and unique sushi rolls! The names of the rolls were very unique. Most of the rolls were named after famous music artists.   We ordered an array of sushi rolls! Unfortunately, I was so exhausted from traveling I forgot all the rolls we ordered. It didn't matter tho, they were all fantastic!  If I'm ever in Montreal again, I will absolutely be back here for more sushi!"}
{"text":"Super excellent sushis! Great chef and staff, very friendly and passionate about what they do. I went at the restaurant to order some take-out sushis last Saturday for my spouse and we had a great time with the discovery combo for 2. They were able to modify it slightly to accommodate my vegetarian spouse."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome, great sushi and absolutely amazing service. Will definitely go back soon and next time I do I will just sit down and let the sushi man prepare anything he wants for me.  I had 2 rolls and one \"tuna Christmas tree\" and just could get enough, I wanted to order every single thing on the menu,"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. The other reviews don't lie.This place is AWESOME. Not only DE-LI-CIOUS, but the team is also amazingly cool. Nomadic me showed up at 7:30pm without a reservation after seeing other reviews, but they managed to squeeze me in. The rolls are just from heaven. Some are rice free (it's so rare to see rice free good rolls!! Not that I don't like rice, but too much is not good since it's high glycemic index). Will definitely make it a goto place when I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"As everyone has already said, this place was great! Delicious, creative food with great service. Great location right in the Plateau. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Living in New York, I get spoiled by having great sushi restaurants everywhere.  So I am usually hesitant to eat at sushi places away from New York unless they are the most expensive kind.  I also usually avoid places that only have a few Yelp reviews. But I was really in the mood for sushi, and the 2 reviews Saint had were both very impressive, so I decided to give it a try.   That was the best restaurant-related decision I've made in a long time.   This place is a perfect sushi restaurant.   It is quaint (only about 15-20 seats), and it has a cool atmosphere (good music at the right volume).  It is run by two long-time friends, one the chef, the other the server. They interact nicely with the small crowd; friendly, conversational, and attentive without being annoying.   And the sushi is amazing (at a surprisingly low price). Very creative arrangements.  Everything I had was excellent.  I ordered \"The Clyde\", a mixture of sushi and rolls chosen by the chef that came with a salad and an appetizer, all for just $22. The rolls included various mixtures of tuna, salmon, tempura, mango, avocado, scallions, and more. And they came with a special yogurt sauce that was as tasty as the rest of the meal.  But the best of all was the \"Christmas trees\" appetizer. A stack of lobster mixed with tempura and scallions, served on a rice chip. I could have had a meal of just those and been very happy.   I can't recommend this place enough.  I will send all my friends visiting Montreal here."}
{"text":"I went here Saturday night for the first time. I'm not big on sushi, but was with friends who love it. We ordered the tasting menu. The first ones we got had a yummy apple flavoured sauce on it. That was probably my favorite in terms of flavor. The Christmas tree was really delicious. Both the one with lobster and the one with tuna (or was it salmon?). The rest was pretty good...like I said, I'm not big on sushi, so I don't have much to compare it to. The only comment one of my friends had was that they don't really play with texture. Everything is just the same soft texture.   The staff was great and friendly.   I'd suggest making reservations."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs sushi de la ville !   Service rapide et souriant, des plats a couper le souffle pour un prix très raisonnable !   Et en plus ils font a emporter, ideal pour les plateaux télés du dimanche soir ;)"}
{"text":"Very high quality sushi with an impressive selection and novel combinations available. Awesome lunch specials with good options and competitive pricing. Service was outstanding and personal. A remarkable level of freshness in the sushi."}
{"text":"I am a huge sushi fan! I've been to sushi in Chicago, New York City, Miami, and multiple other cities; however, Saint Sushi is the BEST sushi I have ever had in my entire life. I currently live in CT and I would happily make the 5 1/2 hour drive just for this sushi. The Christmas trees are to die for."}
{"text":"Don't go into this place expecting traditional sushi, because you'll be disappointed and will miss an opportunity to appreciate something new.  I would put 5 stars just for the service. Our waiter was a gem: cracking jokes, super attentive and ready to answer all our questions. The omakase is a great way to discover what they do best. The downside? No alcohol. You can't even bring your own.   The tasting menu starts off with sashimi in a sake reduction and julienned apple. Delicious. The apple adds a tangy twist that harmonizes well with the fish.  We couldn't get enough of the \"Sapin de Noel\", like they call it. Tartare with spicy mayo, crispy panko and fish eggs, served on a rice cracker.  The sushi plate itself was good, but not memorable. The rolls' names were though. Try the \"Michael Jackson\" (black nori on the inside but white rice on the outside) or the \"Madonna\" (with yellow mango). My favorite was the rice paper-wrapped spicy salmon roll. Just wow. Plus, you have a choice of sauces to dip your sushis in: spicy yogurt, soy sauce or fish/vinegar sauce.  We were just hungry enough for the omakase. It was satisfying, but the food was so good that we still contemplated ordering another plate of sushi rolls.  Just out of gluttony.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Maki is delicious, service is on point, chef is interactive and has great energy. Atmosphere of the restaurant is dope.  Merry Christmas, order it."}
{"text":"The bust sushi I've had in Montreal. Get the tasting menu, it won't let you down. You'll need a reservation!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this sushi joint. The ambiance is quaint, the service friendly and on point, aaaaaand the food is sooooooo tasty. If you love sushi and want to be taken on a flavour tour without breaking the bank, this is the spot. The tasting menu is fairly priced and delicious. Everytime we are a small group for a special occasian, this is my number one suggestions. Can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Dear Saint Sushi Bar,  Our friend M recommend you so many times, we knew that when the time came for her to go back home, you would be the perfect host for our farewell dinner. We came early (~5 PM) on a cold winter evening, and stepped into your cozy, welcoming dining room. The place was empty, so we had the chance to sit at the bar.   Have you ever felt like you wanted to be part of the team that was serving you dinner? Well that's how cool you were! It was like having dinner at a friend's place - only a friend with professional sushi skills. Music seems to be a connecting thread at Saint Sushi Bar, and we bonded over that topic, changing the playlist, recommending concerts and reminiscing 80's, 90's and 00's best hip hop/R&B gurus.  Then there was the food itself. The tasting menu was in three parts, starting with a refreshing carpaccio-style sashimi that was full of flavours. This was followed by the very festive 'Christmas trees', little towers of salmon or lobster mixed with green onions and tobiko. Last came the gorgeous plate of sushi rolls. They were all named after famous musicians, and the most eye catching of them all (perhaps because I'm a fan) was The Beatles, a colourful creation shaped like a flower, with enoki mushrooms as pistils. We were allotted 10 rolls each, but portions are quite generous, so we were overwhelmingly full toward the end of the dinner.    What a great meal, and even greater people! Next time, we will make sure to come early again, as we can enjoy your company to the fullest. The food only makes it better :)  Warm wishes for the cold months,  I&J"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Granted, I'm not much of a sushi connoisseur either, aside from gorging on whatever you can find at AYCE places. In any case, as a sushi newbie, this place was incredibly nice.  We made reservations for two an hour and a half in advance on a Thursday evening, and got seats at the bar, right next to the chefs. When we got there, we got seated fairly quickly and were served really well. As first-timers, we got recommended the tasting menu ($25 ea, tax in), which was a delicious 3-course assortment of 14 different pieces (2 sashimi, 2 christmas trees, and 10 rolls).  Being able to see the chefs prepare the food in front of us, we saw the care that went into the sushi itself and the presentation of each plate. The chef was really friendly too, and made small talk with us as we were waiting for our food. The sushi wowed me as it came, and tasted as great as it looked. I'm not very good at describing food aside from saying that it's yummy, but I'd like to say that the variety in the rolls was really enjoyable, and each kind of roll had a distinct, flavourful taste to it.  Overall, it was a great experience. The price is great (even cheaper than AYCE dinners) and the food is delicious and filling. Definitely recommended for anyone stopping by the area looking for some great food to eat."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, very nice and cozy little place. Cool well informed hosts. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Took my teen son here for a lunch excursion while on vacation in Montreal and we were thrilled. We both got a lunch special, with salad. Everything was super fresh, the salmon was dreamy. The \"Christmas trees\" with lobster were on point. And the guys working there couldn't be nicer."}
{"text":"Amazing food, cool vibe, friendly staff! What more can you ask for!  My husband and I came for dinner around 5:45 PM during the week. We didn't have a reservation and were told that we could sit at the bar or sit at a table until 7 pm, which was plenty of time to enjoy our meal. The restaurant is small, so reservations seem necessary for \"normal\" dining times.  The server walked us through the menu and explained how the tasting menu worked. It is chef's choice, but the server told us what we would get, which helped with decision making. We decided to do one tasting menu and an extra roll for the two of us.   Everything tasted amazing! I loved the sashimi presentation and the interesting Christmas tree! The rolls were full and flavourful - I think my favourite was the Madonna.  The staff seemed to love their job and we got to enjoy 90s music while dining! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Saint sushi is a spot not to miss. The food was impeccable and the service was as good as it gets. Our servers were friendly and genuine. Highly recommend the \"Christmas tree\" tuna tartar and the Michael Jackson roll. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this sushi bar. You will love here with their Xmas tree."}
{"text":"Wow! Can sushi this good be this cheap? The service was impeccable and the food was on point. Great vibe with hip-hop playing in the background and all the staff extremely friendly. Each introducing themselves by name. Respect! FYI: Alcohol Free."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Came in for an early (6pm)  dinner. Service was very good and very fast.  We were in and out within half an hour! I wouldn't have objected staying longer though (another time) because the ambiance was super cool,  with casual yet kind staff,  interesting  and varied clientele, and awesome dub tunes in the background.   Now for the food: the menu is relatively small for a Montreal sushi place,  but I consider that to be an advantage - everything is fresh! My vegetarian partner got an avocado roll and the only veggie roll on the menu.  She loved both,  but the small veggie selection might limit our future visits. I had one of the dinner combos, the Bonnie.  It started with an original sashimi. Two fat salmon pieces with jullien style apple shreds,  olive oil, light chilli, and sliced scallions. Wow!  Juicy and full of flavours. The main dish was not as tantalizing, but was still very good.  It contained two different rolls and four pieces of nigiri (two salmon,  and two shrimp). They have cheaper lunch specials until 2:30 pm.  I was very happy with the food,  the service and the atmosphere of the place. It's not the cheapest sushi place in the neighborhood,  but I highly recommend it.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"For my boyfriend's birthday, I was looking for awesome new restaurants for the both of us to try. When I first clicked on Saint Sushi Bar's yelp page, the photos looked so good. When I actually clicked on the image, it shows that one of the pictures belonged to my cousin & fellow foodie, Kim T. After reading her review, I knew this is a place worth trying.   Good : We showed up as walk ins and the place was already packed, and the friendly host suggested we come back in 30 mins, so we strolled around the charming Duluth street. Finally we got a seat by the sushi bar so we get to watch all the action. Our waiter was really attentive, taking the time to explain how the menu works and recommended the tasting menu for our first time. $20 per person for some of the best sushi ever? Sold. The food arrived quickly and waiter would enthusiastically explain the dish (which also gets me hyped up). The service was fantastic, my overall experience is very favourable.  Bad : The wait will suck if you're a walk in. It's a very small space, but worth going for the food. Be smart, make reservations, don't be a walk in.  Bottom Line: I am craving sushi as I write this. This place is the real deal. Now I know why there's a lot of 5 stars on their Yelp page."}
{"text":"Last Saturday night, after a bad experience at TORO-TORO tapas place in the Old Montreal, we grabbed a cab and went to Saint Sushi based on the reviews from Yelp. This is not your usual sushi place. It was packed with a younger crowd, and there was a 5 to 10 min wait because we had no reservations.   I have to say the sushi tasting \"secret menu\" was just great!  IT is a family run business, and the sushi makers are an international bunch, but there was at least one Japanese individual from what I could tell. I usually avoid sushi and sashimi bars if I see anybody but Japanese behind the bar. In my experience the Japanese sushi makers have a particular feel for the quality  and freshness of the fish, I guess it is because they grow with it.   The sushi sample was outstanding. We also ordered sashimi, and it was good and fresh.  The place is not expensive, but they need to explain the prices more clearly. We were charged 19.95 per person, which is fine, as our usual trips to sushi/sashimi bars is always over 50 dollars per person, but the waitress was talking about a $22 sampler. Maybe they need to talk to each other more, because we were served by three different people.   This place is new and does not have an alcohol license, so we had to stop by another bar to have some sake, otherwise the experience is not complete ))))"}
{"text":"Small but so cozy !! I went there sunday night and although all other resto around were pretty empty, this one was packed!! Luckily i had a reservation!   We took the tasting menu, as suggested by so many reviewers ( and so did everyone in the resto apparently lol)   Sushi were good, very fresh and tasty! And the miso soup.. Oh lord!! Im usually not a fan so just my bf took one and once i tried It.. Couldnt let go of the spoon! He had to ask the waitress for another one Lol!   I absolutely LOVED the music ( old school rnb of the 90's) and the ambiance is just so laid back its awesome!   Only small downer is that i thought the sushi were small and cut too thin :( everybody in the resto was having the tasting menu..i dont know, maybe 1 roll that usually was cut into 5 pieces was instead cut into 7..only reason why i took one star out!   But would def go back!"}
{"text":"If you like sushi, you found one of your paradises spots! :) They have tasting menus, that I got with my friend, it is similar to another sushi place in the Plateau called Tri, actually as per we got as an info one part of the crew originally was working there  Try the Menu Dégustation, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"If you want an assortment of things including seafood wrapped up in rice with seaweed, you will find that here. Yes the rolls are creative and music driven. But this is not 'sushi'. It looks like a Thai restaurant and tastes like a western restaurant. The Christmas Tree is terribly fattening. Of course the Christmas Tree tastes decent - most everything that is deep fried ends up tasting good. I left here feeling full, oily and missing Vancouver sushi."}
{"text":"Trendy sushi spot with lots of innovative fusion dishes. They recommend the taster's menu (Clyde) which is supposedly the best bang for your buck. It's not the most filling meal but you get a lot of taste and textures with each dish.  I didn't find the dishes particularly memorable but it's worth trying at least once. The sapins de noël are nice and crunchy. The service is friendly and upbeat and it gets crowded really quickly."}
{"text":"Very difficult to find since it is in a residential neighborhood.   Since we frequent CA, HI and Vegas and having access to some of the best sushis in the world, this was really mediocre.  The tuna was gritty and flavorless.  There was a lot of rice and mayo sauces that covered up the flavor of the fish more than complement it.  AND we had to pay for street parking around the neighborhood as well so it was a disappointment but I think the locals like it and it was crowded.  We were able to get in without reservations but they told us we only had until 730 to finish our meal which worked out fine since we weren't that impressed and ready to leave after 50 minutes or so.  Service was find and they guys seemed nice enough.  I'd pass if there is limited time here in Montreal."}
{"text":"I took a sampler plate which was good but it was pricy, almost about CAD23, personally I didn't like the salad, there was a kind of sea vegetable and not my type at all. Place is quite and good service."}
{"text":"Saint sushi is great BUT... getting the omakase, all the makis are very VERY similar. Same concept (salmon with tempura) with slight different nori paper, rice paper, cucumber.   Overall, its good don't get me wrong but Saint sushi needs to come up with new sushi rolls in the omakase or they're gonna start losing clients fast."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi place. The crew is relaxed and very friendly. The sushis are so good and the menu is creative. I really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tried their tasting menu. $24 for 14 pieces. Thought it was a bit expensive. We couldn't stay for too long so I had to take it to go. The sushi was unique and very tasty. Will definitely go back for more sushi in the future, they do look like they have a huge variety and tasty sushi. The place is small and very busy. I had to wait 30 minutes for my sushi! Staffs are friendly."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of trying this new place out during my fiancé's 40th birthday. We sat at the bar and chatted with the chefs and the owners. This a small 40 seat restaurant and the music is blaring. The takeout was non-stop as the restaurant was packed and we saw streams of people walking in to also pickup their takeout. Beautiful food, beautiful people beautiful experience. The Christmas Tree treats were amazing. A place to rediscover again."}
{"text":"I walked into this sushi bar during my first trip to Montreal, I had done some research on sushi in the area and stumbled upon Saint Sushi. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by very welcoming staff. The dining room was small, but had a good atmosphere and was comfortable. The menu is small, but incredibly creative and covers a variety of types of sushi. The chef was happy to explain anything he was serving in both French and English. I ordered the sampler that was a three course sushi meal that covered a lot of different things on the menu. All 3 courses were phenomenal and the fish was incredibly fresh. People with previous experience with Japanese food would enjoy Saint Sushi, but a newcomer to sushi may have trouble with the specific menu. Overall a great experience and highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolument fantastique !!! En tant que grands amoureux de sushis, nous y avons été à peine 1 mois après son ouverture (il avait déjà de très bons commentaires sur yelp).  La première fois, plus de place. Il faut dire que l'endroit n'est pas bien grand (5-6 tables) et nous n'avions pas réservé... un Vendredi soir. La deuxième fois, après nous êtres assurés qu'il y avait de la place, nous y voilà ! Très bonne ambiance, musique super sympa, et les serveurs ont la patate et le sourire !! La carte n'est pas bien longue, mais tout à l'air délicieux. Suivant les conseils sur Yelp, nous avons demandé un menu dégustation (20$ taxes incluses/pers). Avec du thé... un régal ! Thé vert avec des grains de mais soufflés... super ! Le menu comprend 3 services, dont le dernier est une sélection du chef des makis de la carte. Nous avons réellement découvert de supers sushis ! Mais je vous laisse la surprise :) Le mot de la fin ? Courrez-y !!!!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal, we looked up sushi restaurants on YELP and decided to visit Saint Sushi by recommendation.  What a pleasant surprise.  The owner/chef greeted us, explain to us the menu, and recommended the dinner for two (plenty of food at a great price).  He explained each course and what to expect. I enjoy sushi and sashimi of all kinds, but this was some of the best I have ever eaten.   PROS:  I enjoyed the owner and his business partner/also a chef... their story and passion was refreshing.  The food is excellent and the presentation is amazing artwork.  The green tea is divine!   CONS:  It's not a traditional sushi bar, if that's what you're looking for (ordering pieces, etc.), but if you're wanting something different in the world of sushi you will enjoy this tremendously.   OVERALL:  It was a wonderful experience... a culinary masterpiece!  The place is small, intimate and fun.  I highly recommend Saint Sushi while visiting Montreal.  Stay open and you will experience a wonderful time, great food, and some wonderful new friends!  A+"}
{"text":"If you want to have ambience! This is not the place! Sushi is delicious but it's expensive! I won't go for the second time"}
{"text":"We came in here and got the tasting menu and some hot tea; total for the two of us was a reasonable $46 plus tip.     The sushi was fine, but nothing memorable compared to most places we've had sushi before.  One big positive about this place is that everyone who worked there was very friendly and personable.  Decor seemed an odd choice for a sushi bar (it looked more like a Thai or Lao restaurant decor than that of a sushi joint); nothing wrong with it, it just seemed out of place."}
{"text":"I would give saint sushi 3.5 rating if I could! My boyfriend and I did the tasting menu. In his opinion he didn't like it because he was hungry in the end and the only roll he truly enjoyed was the Michael Jackson. I loved the appetizers, we added on the shrimp tempura which was very tasty, the Christmas trees were sooooo great wow! The rolls are not traditional sushi rolls. I enjoyed one a lot that used rice paper instead of seaweed but the end pieces were incredibly chewy. The rest of the rolls were really light and refreshing! In my opinion it's something different and nice to try, $25 per person was great for what you got. I wouldn't put it on my top 10 but I would go for a change if you're a sushi lover !"}

{"text":"Sushi was out of this world and probably the best I ever had. Would visit Montreal again just for this place. Staff was very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Went to there with a high expectation. However, the sushi was just average and doesn't taste like the genuine sushi.  We ordered the Christmas tree, the Michale Jackson maki and other two rolls. Their flavors  were very similar and taste like they put a lot MSG which I don't like that much. The service was attentive, but the waiter had really strong cigarette smell which was a bit unpleasant."}
{"text":"Il y a probablement autant de restaurants de sushis à Montréal qu'il y a de poissons dans l'Atlantique. Toutefois, il s'avère tout aussi ardu de trouver un bon restaurant  que d'attraper le Big Fish (une des seules références cinématographiques que je suis capable de faire). Lorsqu'on en trouve finalement un, il n'est pas rare de se faire décourager par les prix de leur carte, qui transforment notre take-out tranquille du mardi soir en souper monnayant les coûts d'un mariage royal. On se tourne alors vers la solution facile: le comptoir à sushis douteux du IGA, et quelques larmes pour diluer la sauce soya.  Ok, tu veux savoir un secret?  Au coin de Duluth et St-Denis, il y a un restaurant qui enchaîne les vieilles chansons d'Avril Lavigne, la guitare de Jean Leloup et des chants arabes. Un hôte qui t'aime déjà dès le moment où tu appelles pour faire ta réservation. À peine une trentaine de places assises, une minuscule cuisine ouverte et Ralph, qui de derrière son tablier, se fera un plaisir de jaser avec toi pendant qu'il s'assure que chaque assiette est parfaite avant d'être servie aux clients. Une présentation impeccable, des poissons brillant de fraîcheur, des agencements de saveurs originaux et une adaptation hors pair aux allergies de toutes sortes. Un menu découverte à 25$ qui comprend des créations uniques, dont de sublimes tartares minutieusement taillés, tantôt de saumon, tantôt de homard, et d'alléchants rouleaux colorés .   Ce restaurant c'est le Saint Sushi Bar, et c'est définitivement une perle au fond de l'océan."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday a few months ago. We ordered the tasting menu. Service was friendly and efficient. The food was pretty good and there were some unique flavour combinations. Sushi was very fresh. The only minor downside was that I felt some of the crab/scallop/salmon mixes to all be very similar in taste. Overall we had a nice experience in a nice quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here randomly after looking for sushi places in the area. Saint Sushi came up as one of the top choices that was also open on Sunday so off we went!   Entering the tiny restaurant you're greeted with an eclectic collection of decor from all around the world from a Buddha statue to a bright diner-like light up Coke clock on the wall. We were seated quickly at the bar, a few of the last few seats!   The owner (I found this out after) told us what they had special that day and also about their omakase menu that was a reasonable $25/person. We opted for the omakase.   Similar to those below me, the omakase I got came with apple/salmon tataki with a ponzu sauce, imitation crab meat \"Christmas trees\" on a cracker, and an assortment of 3 rolls that came with a fish sauce and sweet thai dipping sauce. The roll that stood out to me was the one with the spicy salmon and mango wrapped in nori, I can't remember what it was called. A close second was the deep fried roll, I think it was called the Bob Marley?  The food was an interesting concoction of japanese and other cultural influences that I was totally down with. Since we were seated at the bar we got to chat with the chefs who are all super cool guys who really love what they do. One of them was cutting mangoes and even gave us a dish of some to eat since he thought they were \"too good not to share\".   The highlight of my entire time here was definitely the service, closely followed with the food. The guys who run this place are all very nice and friendly. I'll be back here on my next trip to Montreal, that's a fact!"}
{"text":"I think I might be one of the rare people that was quite disappointed by Saint Sushi Bar. We came here three girls and got two of the large tasting menus to share. We've all been to Tri-express before and made the mistake of ordering a tasting menu each, which resulted in each of us not being able to finish half of it so we figured we'd order less this time. The portions at Saint Sushi were not as big as the ones at Tri-express and we came out of our meals hungry.   If you have been to Tri-Express, the menu at Saint Sushi is not very different but I did find that the flavour wasn't as good as at Tri-Express. Every roll as well as the Christmas tree lacked flavour and seasoning (it was not bland but could use some extra seasoning).  Overall, its not a bad sushi restaurant but I don't think it deserves its hype."}
{"text":"Have you been here?  No?  Well, I think you should because I'm jealous you get the opportunity.  This was one of my favourite haunts back when I lived in Montreal.   I started going to Saint Sushi Bar right after it opened up on a narrow little street in my old neighborhood borough.  SSB is consistently delicious, fresh, with great service, wonderful ambiance, creative sushi and the loveliest staff. On my first ever trip in the staff greeted me with a smile and friendly conversation and greeted me with kindness and familiarity in every visit thereafter.   You can expect the atmosphere in Saint to be lively, with lots of hip music.  The folks that run this place work hard and take sushi seriously, but they're certainly not afraid to dance and sing while churning out some sweet rolls.  Two can dine here quite reasonably for $45 when you get the omakase, which is a wonderful sampling of the better menu items at Saint.  Just thinking about it makes my mouth water at the thought of their delicious 'christmas tree' shrimp tartare.  A lot of the rolls here have a very creamy texture that is cut with the crunchiness of cucumber but it's a taste and texture combination that is a true hit.  I'd love to see their menu expand or change a little, but even if they don't change a thing I'll be happy to come back whenever I can. Unfortunately that's not enough these days.  Don't fault them for the lack of a liquor license either -- they've been trying for ages and this is a product of the horrible bylaw system in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best sushi restaurant I went to so far in MTL ! The food is awesome, so is the team running the place, we are very happy we finally tried that place. We'll come back there for sure !  I couldn't recommend it more ; just go there and have the tasting menu, the experience is 100% worth it"}
{"text":"Les sushis sont excellents et frais, nous adorons les prendre à emporter. Cependant les deux dernières fois ou nous avons commandé ils avaient oublié notre commande ou alors l'avaient échangé avec d'autres clients....de plus le prix du menu dégustation ont récemment augmenté."}
{"text":"Staff was accommodating and welcoming. Despite a huge walk in crowd they did a great job seating us and juggling the waiting crowd.   We ordered the tasting menu, being the first time there. It included 3 courses; sashimi, \"Christmas tree\" tartar and 2 rolls per person for $22. The tempura on one of the rolls was incredibly light and airy. They had very unique, fusion style dipping sauces.  They managed to sit ~35 and fit 5-6 staffers with an open kitchen into a space that isn't much larger than most living rooms. But they did it with a cheerful and welcoming air. The cheerful ambiance manages to meld the eclectic decor of bull fights, Chinese tigers and Indian gods into a warm and welcoming space where the cooks and wait staff are dancing to the music and did't hesitate to interact with the patrons. The bustles and hustles of the space always felt sincere and not contrived and despite the crowding somehow managed to feel very private."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best sushi I've ever had. The tasting menu is great. The staff is super friendly . Make sure you have reservations . The place is always full . Whenever I forget to make reservations, they alway make place at the bar where we can see the chefs making the rolls."}
{"text":"A sushi place like no other!  Unique & creative menu in a weird //but rad// ambiance. Plus, the staff is super cool.  Went there for my friend's birthday so we ordered the tasting menu for two. The roll wrapped in cucumber was my favorite. It was just super light and fresh and had some kind of a unique flavor (Maybe because of the mushroom?)  I was so stuffed and satisfied with what they served us 10/10 will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. The attention to detail is amazing. Everything down to the pickled ginger is well thought through.   The staff is super friendly and passionate about their work. Each menu item has a story to tell.   Definitely visit this place when in Montreal. Just be sure to call ahead cause it's busy."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi. Good quality, good service, good rolls. Only downside is that it has a somewhat limited menu and not many drinks.   Very good quality for the price."}
{"text":"Was searching for a good sushi restaurant in Montreal and this was the natural choice based on all the reviews. Sushi menu is unique (names like \"Madonna\" and \"Tupac\" rolls), and absolutely delicious. Highly recommend the Eve lunch combo; 12 pieces of sushi and miso soup. Great service."}
{"text":"A chill dimly lit sushi restaurant that plays endless R&B music in the plateau. The sushi is pretty good although the portions are not very big. Visually, the sushi are amazing! The server we had was very nice and accommodating in terms of explaining the tasting menu. I'd recommend the tasting menu if it's your first time there as it is the best value but make reservations beforehand as they are a popular place. They have a cool ambiance that's on the louder side but a nice little joint nonetheless. I am still hunting for my personal fave sushi restaurant in the city that checks all boxes for me bit I'd say the Saint Sushi is up there. It is a bit pricy for the size."}
{"text":"Although it might not be the most authentic sushi restaurant I've been to, Saint Sushi Bar definitely provides an inventive twist on fusion sushi that will leave you wanting more! I went in on a weeknight when it wasn't so busy (pro-tip: you'll most likely need a reservation to get in during the dinner shift on the weekends or you'll miss out), and I opted to sit at the bar so I could watch my food being prepared.  The main chef who took care of me was very nice and seemed genuinely interested in making friendly conversation. It definitely enhanced the tasting menu that I got, which consisted of sashimi with shreds of apple, \"Christmas trees\" of seafood tartar on thin rice cakes, and Michael Jackson and Bob Marley maki for the last course. You can customize the first two courses with your choice of fish, so I ordered salmon for the sashimi and tuna for the trees! The slightly buttery salmon sashimi was perfectly enhanced by the somewhat tart apple and citrusy sauce on top, while the cut of the rice cake through the tuna tartar provided a nice contrast.   Normally for sushi, I am strongly against the concept of mixing two or more ingredients in roll form unless it's traditional futomaki, but I loved how Saint Sushi Bar added some traditional ingredients from other Asian countries as an experimental element. I also appreciated the fact that they played with the textures of the usual westernized sushi combos instead of leaving the fillings in chunks like they normally are. The Michael Jackson roll was more like your average fusion roll (but with actually fresh ingredients), but the Bob Marley roll was my favorite simply because of its inventiveness with the rice paper roll on the outside and a little bit of creamy yogurt sauce on the inside. It actually worked well together to be greater than the sum of its parts.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to experience western-style sushi that isn't your typical low-quality venture into dragon and spider rolls. That being said, you'll want to take a few trips to try everything on the menu because it's that impressive!"}
{"text":"A place to die for!!!!! If I crave sushi, this is the place that I always go to.  The owners are so down to earth, nice and very friendly. The service is amazing and quick. The music is great, very chill place! The ambiance is phenomenal.  If I could describe the sushi there with one word it would be Orgasmic! I've never had sushi like this in my life. Fresh, tasty and one of a kind. You can actually taste the fish and not the rice like the other sushi places.  The price is affordable as well.  A great place for a date night or even for a small gathering or a small event!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Taste, presentation, and service all hit the mark. Place isn't what I'd call fancy but definitely some of the best sushi I've had.  The only thing I would change is to increase the selection. Give it a try! Your tastebuds will love you for it!"}
{"text":"Really Good Sushi Very Fresh and the service was fast. I highly recommend it! The service was amazing and nice."}
{"text":"Just go!   This place deserves its 4.5 stars.   The cones are probably the best you're gonna have in this area (or anywhere). After three, be warned, you're gonna want more.   Try the Tuna ones.  I also had a seafood maki role - also very good, but I just wish their maki portion was a little bigger (it needs 1-2 more slices), which is why I gave them one less than five stars.  However, I'll definitely be back.  I suspect they don't need my advertisement, but readers should not hesitate to go."}
{"text":"Cool spot! Great atmosphere and the Christmas tree app is insanely good. Had the full course meal X250 so we pretty much got a little something of everything on the menu. Nothing disappointed.   The music playlist was also great. We ended up shazaming as we were singing along with the staff. Will definitely visit again when in Montreal.   Only minor negative was that no alcoholic beverages were served. We would never leave if they did!"}
{"text":"Vraiment très bon et très frais. Le staff est hyper-sympathique et accueillant. Le seul hic, pas de permis de boisson donc on mange nos sushis avec un bon verre d'eau. Remarquez que la qualité de la nourriture fait vite oublier ce problème. À refaire!"}
{"text":"My coworker told me this was her fav sushi place & on saturday my boyfriend I went there since the place we wanted to try was closed (Thank God haha) we were very lucky to find a table without any reservation because the people who came after us had to wait, talk about good timing :) . Our waitress was so funny and nice. The sushi was so fresh and delicious, my favourites were the Christmas trees (shrimp) and the michael jackson rolls even the little rolls with avocado were amazing the avocado was really fresh. Can't wait to go back. Its an hidden gem, don't sleep on it ."}
{"text":"Great sushi, eclectic interior and casual ambiance.   I've been here several times now and every time I'm blown away by the sushi. Its definitely not traditional Japanese sushi, but its a very fun experience in terms of the interior and the taste. The interior has influences from all different south east asian regions as well as east asian influences. It's casual, so there's no need to dress up and every time that I've gone for lunch, there has never been a long wait or reservation needed. The service is great, friendly and they seem very down to earth. Its affordable especially if you share with several people and the bill comes out to be not more than $20 per person.  There is a popular tasting menu as well as several different types of rolls with fun names like the \"Tupac Maki\", \"Michael Jackson Maki\" etc. I've never had sushi like this before but its delicious and full of flavour. I recommend literally everything on the maki list and in the tasting menu! One of the sushis with a cucumber outer layer and no rice was also very new to me and light + delicious. They serve the sushi beautifully as well as you can see in the pictures. Its definitely a real art seeing how they plate their food.   I'm dying to come here again."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine sushi restaurant.  The green tea was earthy and the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Quite sadly, I'm yet to find a great SUSHI place in Montreal :( So I got the omakase and the highlight is the \"christmas trees\" which come toward the beginning of the meal. They are nice and tasty. In fact my first impression was that they are kinda creative as well. And then  the same tree mixture was used in the first maki, and, ok, it was still nice. Then a bit in the other maki and the next one... and half way through the meal it became totally uninspiring and boring :( what I like about having sushi is the mixing and explosion of different textures and flavours in my mouth as I try different sashimi, maki etc. So this place completely missed the mark for me.  On a diff note: I find it kinda surprising why Tri Express chefs think it's a good idea to follow the same idea so closely - but that's material for another review https://www.yelp.ca/biz_photos/tri-express-montreal-4?select=YBRNA2TlC36cVXU72Y1ztA"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Japanese food I've had in Montreal (granted, I haven't had much due to the severe lack of good AYCE). We tried the tasting menu and it was a good value (came to $30 with tax and tip) and it was EPIC!! Everything was delicious. In fact, the whole menu looked good. The Christmas Trees especially. 10/10 would definitely eat again. Also -- good to note that they serve no meat at all (only seafood). We told the waitress that my friend is pescatarian and she said it was not an issue at all."}
{"text":"Top! Un menu dégustation à 22$ par personne. Tout est très bon et ça change des sushis type qu'on retrouve un peu partout. Situé sur duluth"}
{"text":"On a essayé ce restaurant et c'est de loin les meilleurs sushis!!! Prenez leur spécial découverte avec les \"sapins\" !!"}
{"text":"Best sushi ever !  honnêtement ce sont les meilleurs sushi . vous ne vous tromperez pas ! la seule minuscule bémol serait peut-être par rapport au menu dégustation , c'est vrai que ce n'est pas assez pour deux . ( tellement que c'est bon nous en voulons toujours plus!)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. First, its fun and quirky decorations with trendy music catch your attention. The real deal, however, is their fusion style sushi.   Their sushi is definitely not authentic, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. Their rolls are so creative and each one of them is so good you will want to try their whole menu.   I always get the tasting menu here because it lets you try 5 of their rolls with 2 different appetizers. It starts off with salmon sashimi in sesame and pear dressing, which will give you the most unique taste of salmon. Then they serve their Christmas Trees; they are crispy lobster tartar on a rice cracker and this is my personal favourite from this place. I would highly recommend trying their Christmas trees. Then comes the big platter full of their rolls with 2 different sauces. I think this meal has a great value and taste!  It does get a little busy at peak times and may take some time to serve you, but I think it's all worth it."}
{"text":"Sortie dîner avec une amie, on s'est dit qu'on essaierait quelque chose de nouveau. Bien, laissez-moi vous dire à quel point ce fût une superbe idée de venir ici! Alors que la ville accueillait sa première neige de l'année, je suis arrivée avec un peu d'avance. Je me suis dite que je sortirais mon portable pour faire un peu de travail en attendant, mais non! À la place, j'ai fait la rencontre des proprios et du chef. Quelle énergie!!! Gros sourires dès l'accueil, un thé vite servi pour bien se réchauffer, suivi d'un échange nostalgique entourant nos meilleurs souvenirs hivernaux d'enfance ; c'est à ça que se résume mes 20 premières minutes dans la place.   Maintenant, place à la bouffe! Ce n'est pas un menu de sushi typique. Basé sur la musique, ce sont d'intéressants plats qui reflètent leurs artistes favoris. Le staff prend aussi bien le temps d'expliquer le menu et les plats lorsqu'ils arrivent. Si vous avez des allergies quelconques, ils ont de quoi pour vous! Ils font hyper attention et vous trouvent une alternative avec plaisir. Vraiment, chapeau! Les sauces sont bien bonnes, leur plat découverte pour 2 personnes est super intéressant et m'a plus que plu. Pour 20$ chaque, vous recevrez 3 services qui tirent des diverses catégories du menu et une variété de rouleaux, au choix du chef.   Un autre élément positif et pratique est que tous les prix incluent les taxes. Donc, 20$, c'est 20$.   J'y retourne, certain!"}
{"text":"The food was incredible, the staff super friendly. Great place for parties or a tete a tete. You won't be disappointed. Ask for the chefs tasting menus. No alcohol though so make sure your going with people that you enjoy their conversation."}
{"text":"Après avoir lu tant de bonnes chose nous sommes venus tester ce sushi. Premier bon point on nous a aménagé une table car nous n'avions pas réservé et qu'il n'y avait plus de place, on n'avait pas la meilleur place du restaurant mais au moins on pouvait manger et ça c'est cool de leur part :) Nous avons pris le menu dégustation à 23,5$ par personne, à priori augmentation depuis les derniers avis yelp ..., qui vous donne droit à 3 services : premier sashimi avec réduction de saké et pomme, deuxième une sorte de tartare de homard et en dernier un assortiment de maki du chef (bob marley, madonna, beatles et mickael jackson pour notre part). Les 3 services étaient très bon, coup de coeur pour le tartare qui était magique à mon goût :) Les sushis étaient très bons aussi, vraiment très satisfait de notre visite. Le service était à l'écoute et très sympathique, tout simplement un des meilleurs que j'ai eu à Montréal sachant que je suis très difficile :D Je recommande fortement le restaurant ainsi que leur formule dégustation. Cela est encore plus intéressant si vous y allez à plusieurs car vous pourrez goûter plus de maki car il y aura plus de diversité ! En plus ils prennent les réservations ;) Déjà hâte d'y retourner !!!"}
{"text":"Overall, this is my favorite sushi place and I would recommend it to everyone. However, I do have a story related to what makes this place special.  Alright! Here's the story.  It was the third time I had been to this place. The moment I walked through the door, I was greeted by the gentleman who served me the previous time I was there, which was a month ago.  As I was assigned my seat, he says \"Hey, ça va?\" as if we knew each other already. I was caught off guard. To my amazement, I realized that he remembered me. He pointed to the exact spot, to the left near the bar, which my date and I were seated last time. At that moment, it felt special for me. It made me feel valued as a customer.  I finally realized what made this place amongst the top rated restaurants on Yelp. Of course, we can go on and on about the food and decor. In the end, there's one element that the staff adds to this place which makes it wonderful, the personal touch. It's a laid back environment with great service and even greater people. They're basically your friends who happen to serve you food!  *Even if you have allergies, they will make the adjustments necessary to assure you have a great experience.  As for the food, when you open the menu, you don't get overwhelmed with all the items. They provide a good variety, without having the complication of your table coming up with a whole system to what food item every person wants. For the people who want to keep it simple in the decision making, you can go for the \"Tasting Menu,\" where you get to taste all their different types of sushi and see what Saint Sushi Bar is all about. Simply put, this is where you flood your taste buds with euphoria. All at an affordable price of $22 per person!  Take a look at all the photos. Once you're done salivating, go check this place out. Have fun!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not, this was our favorite meal in Montreal during our visit. And we visited several places that were considered to be the best Montreal has to offer (at least for tourists).  This was an accidental visit. But yes, this is probably the cheapest sushi tasting menu you will ever find. And yes, this is probably the only sushi bar you will ever find with the food they offer. And yes, the food is really good and very affordable.  The chefs/owners have a great thing going on, a great founding story, and a great dynamic. If you ever go, be sure to say hi to Ralph and Sang, who made our visit to Montreal even more memorable."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi place in the city!   Not much to say other than that you need to go and have their tasting menu.  P.S. If you love the apple vinegar sashimi as much as I do, you can ask the waiters/waitresses to pour the remaining sauce into a small dish so that you don't look ridiculous licking off the plate it comes in. :)"}
{"text":"Le ciel, le paradis, ce fut une expérience magique. Avec une amie, nous avons commandé le menu dégustation qui comprend 3 services: entrée de saumon avec pommes et sauce sésame,  tartare sur craquelin de riz ( les fameux sapins) et finalement une immense assiette de 4 ou 5 sortes sushis. Les mélanges de saveurs sont bien travaillés ce qui vous amène au 7ème ciel. Bref, durant la première moitié du repas, je ne parlais pas parce que j'étais occupée à soupirer des MMMmmmmm... Bref, j'aurais voulu me lever pour danser de joie et hurler \"Amenez moi le chef! Je dois le remercier!\" Mais bon, ils sont beaucoup trop occupés pour ma folie. L'endroit est super populaire et petit donc réservez! Service rapido pressto et attentioné!"}
{"text":"Nuts. NUTS how great this place is. Funky, unique, fresh, creative and insanely good sushi rolls. The Christmas Tree towers? Salmon and lobster crunch atop a rice cracker? What is going on here! Cannot wait to visit Montreal and go back.  5 stars!!!!!"}
{"text":"Im visiting Montreal with my partner and found this place on Yelp. SO great! Im from San Francisco and we have some pretty good sushi, but this place blew me away! fresh, creative rolls (we had the tasting menu) and such nice service! When we sat down, they told us all about the tasting menu, then asked for allergies, and then brought each plate out and explained everything! We are so happy we found this place :) It's small, so we recommend going early or making a reservation."}
{"text":"I admit this place is quite unique, but way way overpriced. We ordered the tasting menu, and for something like $25/ person, we were extremely unsatisfied after finishing the meal. All three of us were hungry after finishing the three-course tasting menu. The first course was some salmon and tuna sashimi with green apple slices and a sake based sauce. These tiny thin cut slices were delicious, but only included a tiny taste of each (2 slices of super thin fish/ person). Then came the christmas trees. These were alright, but there seemed to be a trend from this dish onwards with an overuse of mayo that kinda dulled the natural flavours of the seafood. The presentation, however, was unique and well-crafted. Next, was the 6 \"rolls\" that came out. And I put the rolls in quotation marks because they really just give you parts of a roll and expect that to be enough. Two rolls were put into rice paper rather than nori, which gave it an interesting texture, and were probably the best ones on the plate. One roll was wrapped in cucumber and was fairly tasteless and underwhelming. The deep fried roll tasted like oil and wasn't very good at all. Again, in the rolls, mayo was overused and masked the natural flavours of fish.   The restaurant had a really cool vibe and was really quite busy. Service was good. The food was interesting, but overpriced. I literally could have ordered a single roll at a different sushi restaurant and have been more full and paid less than I did with this tasting menu. I would not come here again. If it weren't for the nice little restaurant setting and the good service, I'd be giving this place a 2/5."}
{"text":"Following my wise Yelp friends down the trail to this little sushi discovery on Duluth I was not disappointed. Odd decor that looks like an accumulation of euro-mid-east restos gone by in this little 20-seater, no liquor license, and still I can't resist the 5 stars. Because for a flat $20 each, me and my two funny hungry honeypie friends had a 3 course tasting menu that filled us up and left us perfectly delighted. Rivals the best sushi we've had in this sushi-dangerous town that's far from the sea, and at a fraction of the cost. And the service was friendly, funny, interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves, had no allergies, had everything quick since we (ok, I) was at the point of hangry. Honestly, it's kind of rare in this town to eat a meal that so nicely balances price with freshness, inventive flavours and thoughtful friendly service.   Make reservations, this place was steadily full on a snow-covered Thursday."}
{"text":"We stopped by before heading back to Toronto after reading all of positive reviews for this new Sushi Bar. We were immediately sold on the Chef's tasting platter, it was a great delight to have a tour of the entire menu. Service is very friendly and fast. The chef explained to us with passion that he uses the best grade fish from the market. He also replaces mayo in his recipe for yogourt for a healthier choice. I really enjoyed the food. The tea was also excellent, green loose leaf tea with roasted brown rice, the best tea I've ever had. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Des sushis hors de l'ordinaire, un endroit familiale, un service impeccable, suite aux nombreux commentaires nous avons pris le plateau découverte comprenant un belle assortiment, mais a mon gout la présence du tartare dans tous les sushis ne permet pas de ressentir une grande diversité:( mais reste que ce sont des bon sushis très frais  et non commun, je recommande le sushis sapin c'est trop bon même si la encore il est a base de tartare"}
{"text":"En tant que grand amateur de sushi, c'est de loin l'une si ce n'est la meilleure adresse à Montréal. Les sushi sont à des années lumières des autres sushi que vous pouvez manger en ville. La créativité et le goût sont au rendez-vous et ce à chaque bouchée. Les sapins de Noëls sont des pures merveilles ! Vous aller oublier tous les autres sushi que vous avez mangé jusqu'à présent."}
{"text":"Loved it!  Fresh flavors: using apple, mangos, cucumber wrapping on their various creations absolutely delightful! The staff are very friendly but you should book if you want a table.  We went on a Thursday after work without one and were allowed to have our table till 7 pm as it was all booked.  Had the tasting menu.  Pink tuna was lovely with the apples."}
{"text":"Great place. Went there a while back with a friend and immediately felt welcomed. The staff was ready to greet you and see if this was your first visit. Our waitress then explained to us their \"tasting\" menu option for 2 and we immediately thought this would be a great option. From the appetizer to the sushi it was all amazing and not to mention for a great price as well. I got to try things I never had before and probably never would have if it wasn't for their 'deal'. The only thing I would say may be a \"downside\" is if you come with a man, or someone very hungry. As 2 females we were just full. The portions are not huge but are definitely worth your money."}
{"text":"Unique sushi prepared by non-traditional sushi chefs, and I was highly impressed. When you get the tasting menu you will be at the mercy of the chefs, but they will not let you down. Just take a look at some of the pictures of the food here and you won't want to miss stopping by this place the next time you're in Montreal."}
{"text":"WOW!!   I am traveling around the world really a lot but a sushi place like that i didnt see yet!!   The service is extraordinary friendly in a really easy going mood.   The food was just fantastic! We got both the menu - 3 plates for 20$ each!! First we both were thinking if it will be enough but after the main plate we both werent hungry anymore. Just satisfied....  Guys you have to try the christmas trees and this awesome green tea.   It was so good that we came three days later again for lunch to share this experience with a working colleague out of quebec city...  We will definitely go back there!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had the tasting menu for lunch. It was top notch! I personally liked how nothing was too out of the ordinary, in terms of type of fish. It was the usual suspects of tuna, salmon, crab, shrimp, etc. Not a big scary fish I've never heard of. What made it special was hot fresh everything was and also inventive ways of taking familiar flavors and combining them into something new. We were able to talk with the owner and he is such a great, cool guy. BYOB! This is a not to miss next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite sushi place in Montreal. The price/quality ratio is unbeatable.  I like how they put the focus on the quality of the fish instead of using rice as a filler like many places do. You MUST try the \" christmas tree \" it's unbelievably good. Everything i've had was delicious, I randomly get cravings for their sushi.  Service is always excellent, chefs are super friendly and ambiance is nice. I love their funky playlist, whoever is choosing these tracks is amazing."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of the Montreal Sushi scene, however I have to admit that Saint Sushi with few others are above anyone else and I consider them as one the best in town. I usually go there and have their Tasting Menu for 26$ taxes included, it's a 14 pieces menu which includes sashimi and maki, it's not very consistent if you're really hungry but fair for what you pay. The restaurant is pretty with a nice and cozy decor and atmosphere however the music there does not coincide with everything else, it's hip hop and it's loud, why? Also, no desserts.."}
{"text":"The sushi is so good, it makes you realize that soy sauce can be completely superfluous. And the service is so genuinely welcoming, it makes you feel like they've been waiting for you to arrive. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable sushi! I come here every time I'm in Montreal! It's worth flying over just for one of their rolls! I wrote a review last time and had to write another one.  GUYS, you MUST EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"I'm usually really picky with my sushi. I always have certain types of them I order, for instance like the California role. So once I went here, I saw the menu, and they dont have a lot of options from the usual ones, so I was sure I wouldnt like this place.  But we decided to order the chef's choice and a few classic ones just in case. The food came and OMG it was so good! My favorite was the one called \"Christmas Tree\", its almost only samon but I loved it. I'd come back here again for sure.  P.S. its better if you have a reservation there, as the place is small, and we had to wait a bit since we didn't have a reservation"}
{"text":"Simple tucked away little place with exceptional sushi. Attentive but not hovering staff, the right sized menu selection, and quality cuts of fish. When I hear about Montreal's cuisine, it's usually about French food, fatty cuts of pork, duck confit, foie gras, etc. I never thought to look up a sushi place, but the urge hit us so we went to the highest rated place around us. I didn't know what the expect with the Sapin de Noel (x-mas tree) but was surprised by how much flavor was tucked into these little things! They went perfectly with a tiny bit of the creamy sauce they provide on the side and a dab of soy sauce."}
{"text":"Food: the menu degustation is a good option for a first visit. Its a 3 courses meal: 1-Sashimi with apple, fresh in the mouth and the dressing is light and flavourful. 2-sapin de noel (salmon and shrimps tartar). I like the crunchy and spicy of that dish. 3-mixed of makis chef's choice, alot of swag in the maki just like the names of them (Bob marley, MJ, etc) i like it!.  The sake reduction sauce is really good, a nice complement with the makis.  Service: super friendly and quick!  Ambiance: alot people, crowded place. any sushi fan will like it.   Conclusion: im coming back!"}
{"text":"ce resto se distingue de ses voisins grecs et italiens assez moyens.  Si vous voulez les meilleurs sushi en ville vous êtes à la bonne porte.   Les chefs sont des amateurs de musique où leurs uvres portent le nom de leur musicien préféré tel que Michael Jackson à Bob Marley, Bonnie et Clyde...    Le menu dégustation est un plus à essayer si c'est votre première fois ainsi il vous sera plus facile de choisir vos sushis préférés.    Le seul petit bémol est que les propriétaires attendent toujours l'obtention de leur permis d'alcool."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have sushi! A little small and chaotic when it's busy and let's be honest it's probably always busy but totally worth it!  Original menu, definitely recommend the degustation menu which is super cheap and absolutely outstanding!  The \"Christmas Tree\" appetizer is great and the sushi is fantastic. The service is second to none and people are super friendly. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Read good reviews about this place so decided to give it a try.  Decor is pretty cool with lots of thai influence. We had no reservation so had to sit at the sushi bar which was fine with me because I like watching the chefs roll their sushi.  My friend and I ordered 2 miso soup and the combo called Cycle which included 10 pieces of maki, 4 pièces of sushi, 2 pieces of the Christmas tree and sashimi.  First came the miso soup...oh god it was salty!!!...barely took 2 sips. When we told the waiter, he said he would not charge us for them...ok.  As for the sushi, definitely cannot be called authentic. There is a lot of fruits used in the roll...which kind of masked the taste of the fish in the sushi rolls. Sushi in Japan is all about the fish...keeping everything simple so thay you can taste the freshness of the fish. It was good sushi but not something I would call authentic. You know it is fusion sushi when you see non japanese/Asian making sushi :p  Although not the best I have tried but for the price, it is a pretty good bang for your buck. The service was also pretty good. I would go back for some affordable sushi and the sushi chef was very funny and made this experience a lot more fun."}
{"text":"Good service, bad sushi. Globs of mayo. Yogurt sauce? In sushi?!? I shouldn't have to go get a different food to get a bad taste out of my mouth after dinner. We both hated this place."}
{"text":"Hmm. A little disappointed with this one. We got an assortment of sushi, which wasn't bad, but some were better than others and one roll my friend and I didn't like at all. Very fresh, one of the rolls we ordered was pretty hot, but my favorite was actually the simple avocado roll. I really wanted to try Kazu, but it was farther out for us. If I were to go here again, I'd stick with the simple rolls."}
{"text":"Saint's was a really good, quick place to get decently priced sushi. I got the Marvin Gaye, Sensei, and Tupac rolls. They were amazing, and my fiancé really liked his Michael Jackson rolls too. The server was really nice too. I'd recommend this to anyone in the area for a nice lunch or dinner date."}
{"text":"Really unique, fun sushi! The food is delicious and the presentation is awesome. Nice to have a change from the typical sushi selection!"}
{"text":"When we entered the restaurant (with no reservation) we were offered a table under the condition we would be out in 45 minutes as they would need the tables for those who had previously reserved them at that time.  This seemed fair to us.  They were playing a mix of hip hop from the 1990s/2000s and the lighting was dimmed a bit for a chill ambiance.  The staff were friendly, considerate, and attentive.  I have to eat wheat-free due to a food sensitivity and I ordered the \"chef's special\" type dinner.  The staff said it would be no problem to prepare this gluten free and I was impressed.  I was even brought a brand new bottle of gluten free soy sauce for the full sushi experience.    My sushi was so fresh!  Fresh sushi just tastes different.  It's worlds better.  I was even brought a separate sauce for one of the rolls as it was a better pair for the flavor.  How fancy.  FYI they don't serve alcohol.  I absolutely recommend this place for sushi/sashimi."}
{"text":"This place is friggen awesome. I arrived with two friends at around 7:15 with no reservation and the place was packed. We had little hope in finding a table, but the host/waiter was incredibly kind and accommodating and said he would have a free table in about ten minutes. My group and I headed out and walked around for a while before returning to the restaurant. The party whose table we would take was settling up so we just hung around outside and waited for a bit longer. We had not been waiting long at all and were not frustrated in the least but the same host/waiter that greeted us came outside and offered us a complimentary sample of their signature \"Christmas Tree\" appetizer. It's basically a seafood tartare with great flavor on top of a rice cracker. Not long after, we were invited in and sat next to the window. The menu was in French, which made things a bit complicated, so we decided to get the 3 person sampler which comes to about 20 bucks a person. HOLY CRAP WAS THIS AN AWESOME DEAL. It started was a round of sashimi, then more of the \"Christmas Trees\" describes before, and a massive plate of sushi to share. Everything was absolutely delicious and we left with full bellies, full wallets, and an urge to write a kick ass review. Would suggest to anyone who wants some pretty awesome sushi for an unbeatable price."}
{"text":"My favourite place to take out-of-town friends! I can honestly say that this is the best sushi I've had in the city and quite possibly my favourite restaurant. This cozy little joint serves up delicious sushi with a non-traditional twist and great service to boot! Everything on the menu is so fantastic it would be a shame to only sample one or two items - the tasting menu is definitely the way to go. The christmas trees and sashimi & apple dish are items I wouldn't have ordered on my own but ended up being among my favourites. Tasting menu for the win! It's worth noting that it's a really tiny space so try to make a reservation if you can. Oh, and they don't serve alcohol or do the whole BYOB thing."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to Tri Express and loved it, but found that the seating situation was less than ideal, than this is the place for you.  I think the chef here used to work for Tri because the flavour profile is almost identical.   That special flavour they put in very roll that you just can't wrap your taste buds around (unami maybe?) is found in all the sushi's here as well. They also have that yummy tartar topped on a cracker found at Tri that goes by the name 'Christmas tree'  Super affordable and set in a larger space with tables of decent size, it's a very nice place to enjoy a weekday sushi outing.  Get the chefs tasting menu (23.50$), you won't be disappointed.   Only downside is that, like Tri, they don't have an alcohol permit so you can't pair a good sake with the delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious - awesome flavours. Great presentation. Friendly folks. Good tunes. Pretty relaxed atmosphere. Just my kind of place."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood to sip on Sake and eat sushi, don't come here. There is no alcohol which honestly threw me off guard BUT the sushi is wonderful! Definitely on the pricier side though if you decide to choose individual rolls. My bill was $75 for 2 people and we only had 30 pieces of sushi (and NO alcohol....) but the service was A++, food was freshly made in front of you (if you're at the bar) and every piece of sushi melted in your mouth. I would definitely suggest you give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Eccellente!!! Small place very cozy. Service is fast. I always like to order the Menu Degustation for 28$ is enough and with different kind of sushi. I love it!!! I very racomended this restaurant!!! For me the best sushi in Montreal!!!"}
{"text":"Best miso soup I have ever had. The maki was enjoyable and unique, with interesting combinations. The maki is really fat compared to most places I've had. Pricing was reasonable and the service was great even though they were very busy. Staff was all really friendly. They do not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Best sushi!! Great combination of chef fantasy, delicate tasting and staff cordiality! Rapid service and detailed explanation of chef creations: tasting menu highly advised of you want to try different rolls. The only reason for not having a full 5 stars is because they do not have wine or beers yet: for the rest i suggest everybody to go and eat the best sushi you have ever had!"}
{"text":"On two occasions in my life, I got an endorphine rush by eating food. My meal at Saint Sushi Bar was one of them. 11/10"}
{"text":"Being a new yorker visiting Montreal for the first time with my boyfriend,  we were skeptical about trying sushi elsewhere besides, we know what's good sushi. My review only goes to the tasting platter that we shared. It was absolutely amazing. Not the traditional type of special rolls  but an entire fusion with a little bit of rice paper mushrooms, etc etc. The flavors were unique and well  put together, tasted nth like the rolls I've  had in nyc. I would recommend this to other sushi lovers! But be sure to make a reservation,  the waitress was really nice and took us after a 5 min wait, excellent service as well! Green tea is a plus, you can smell and taste the roasted brown rice. Rich aroma in addition to the sushi! Did I mention they had their own special sauce?"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs sushiii en ville tout simplement ! Je vous suggère le Menu dégustation."}
{"text":"Great guys that run this place, very friendly and welcoming. The food is real tasty and reasonable in price.  The sampler plate was a great because you get to try a few things at once"}
{"text":"This place is amazing - the lobster trees melt in your mouth. Great atmosphere and some hip, classy folks making the food :)"}
{"text":"Des sushis plutôt bons, mais un peu chers !  Je me suis rendue à Saint Sushi Bar un mardi soir avec 3 amis (sans réservation), et nous avons dû attendre 30 minutes pour avoir une table. Le restaurant est très petit (10 tables environ), il faut donc mieux réserver pour être sûr de pouvoir y manger.  Côté service, l'attente était (trop) longue. Les assiettes sont jolies et bien présentées, mais cela ne justifie pas de patienter 30 minutes pour pouvoir les déguster.  Pour ma part j'ai pris 2 assiettes de makis : - Le saumon épicé (x5)  - Le Marvin Gaye (x5)  C'était bon, mais 20$ pour 10 makis (taxes incluses), ça fait quand même un peu cher (2$ le maki tout de même...). Donc pour être certain de ne pas avoir faim en sortant, il vaut mieux prendre l'un des deux menus dégustation (à 25$ et 27$ - les prix ont apparemment augmenté). Attention néanmoins, il n'est pas possible de choisir la composition des menus dégustation (ne serait-ce que le type de poisson).  Petit bémol : j'ai demandé de la sauce teriyaki sucrée (oui je sais, ça n'existe pas vraiment en dehors de l'Europe). Et on m'a facturé 1$ de plus pour une MINI coupelle que j'ai terminée en trempant à peine 3 makis."}
{"text":"O. M. G.  This place is AMAZING! The vibe was great, everyone was super friendly, and the food was absolutely astounding. They recommended trying the Tasting Plate, which is a sampler of multiple different dishes. I highly recommend that plate. I'll even get it again when I go back every single time I visit Montreal! No such thing as bad food here."}
{"text":"This place was such a nice find.  It was simple, my wife and I (American tourists) felt like getting sushi, so we Googled 'montreal sushi yelp'.  Despite being skeptical we gave it a try and it was really good.  The owner and waiter were extra nice and the food was great.  We got the sampler plate which I think was the best option for exploring the menu.  We complimented the tea and the waiter gave us a small take-away container of loose tea on our way out.  I wish them success.  On a side-note, we noticed that section of Duluth street had a different vibe that we liked a lot--it was less frenetic and prettier than adjacent streets.  Going there made for one of the highlights of our visit."}
{"text":"I always recommend this place to friends looking for a great sushi place. It's a fusion type of sushi restaurant but that grasps the essence of great Japanese cuisine. They don't hold back on the fresh ingredients and there's never any \" filler \" ingredients like too much rice. The secret-not-so-secret \" menu de dégustation \" is always a great choice, wether it's your first time or your fifth.  Amazing place. Amazing staff. Amazing food.  Make sure to reserve in advance on Friday and Saturday nights because seating is very limited!"}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious =).  Probably one of the best sushi place in town.  We orderes the tasting menu after stalking our neighbours =P.  First come the green apple and salmon sashimi - hands down the best appetizer I ever had in a sushi restaurant.  Then come the christmas cracker (I think thats what its called).  The name is perfect - the food is like an explosion of yumminess in your mouth.    Next and finally come the plate of sushi variety - I think we finished that in like a few second.... Lol it was that good.  Just come there if you havent.  You wont regret it =).  Ooo and we got treated cookies and tootsie roll - yay =)."}
{"text":"Went there with my boyfriend and we tried the ''secret'' menu, which was a 3 courses menu. We also had the miso and the wakame salad in addition. Everything was yummy and fresh but mostly, original! I never tasted these kinds of sushi before. They also had very funny names. The service was perfect and I liked the fact that the staff looked like they were having fun in the open kitchen. I would recommend to anybody who want to have a good time and experience new kinds of japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Snapshot: Freshness 5/5, Sushi Uniqueness 5/5, Value 5/5  Montreal may not be as know for sushi but the guys at Saint Sushi Bar will put it on the map. One of funkiest vibes accompanied with truly unique rolls.  The Bob Marley and Christmas Tree are worth ordering.   Additionally, get the Tasting Menu you will not be disappointed. 3 courses and tons of fresh fish.  The service was prompt and you can't beat the price. The sushi is MTO and some of the best I've enjoyed.  Enjoy and thanks guys"}
{"text":"I don't get the rave of this place. I got the tasting menu and its just OK. Not worth the money. Why? Although I respect the efforts they made to make the menu interesting and flavorful, I have many other options if I just need to see salmon served in a thousand different ways. Use some more expensive fishes, would you?"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi in a small unassuming restaurant. And it is super affordable! Fixed menu was three courses and 26$ CAD per person.   We sat at the bar and Raul entertained and spoiled us to some delicious sushi. It's not the typical fare -- more sweet than savory flavors. They asked for any allergies and preferences which was fantastic.   Sashimi came with julienned green apple and a sweet oil. Christmas trees were interesting -- it was a shrimp/tuna mix with tempura flakes on a rice cracker. Then came the rolls. Four glorious rolls. The Beatles was my favorite (fresh and rolled in cucumber).   Definitely check the place out for a great sushi dinner!"}
{"text":"Great sushi place in Montreal. I tried their tasting menu and really love it. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you like sushi, don't go here.   We ordered the tasting menu, which is a funny name since everything tasted the same. They gave us several different pieces, which they give pop-star names (since they can't name them the actual fish, like every other sushi place). They all had the same mayo-and-smashed-tuna taste. I think they only use 1 fish but to be honest you can't even taste that because it just tastes like mayo.  This was the #1 rated sushi restaurant on Yelp in Montreal, and honestly, this is by far the most help has failed me."}
{"text":"This restaurant we decided to try since last Friday(August  5th, 2016) and finally we tried today on a Wednesday for lunch is absolutely disappointing. Maybe our expectations were too high since it was so difficult for us to go there and try to eat- it was either full or closed and we tried 3 times before we could eat there today, it turned out was not worth at all. Why? We went there during lunch time and it was very quite, the place is petit and clean with a mix of oriental decorations(from my observation it was more leaning to Thai style than Japanese), which I thought it was a very high end Japanese sushi restaurant(from all the high rating and comments), the staff was nice, and their food was surprisingly ordinary-chef selected sushi special for lunch came out to be only 2 different kind sushi maki roll cut into 12 pieces and plus 2 shrimp sushi, in total of 14 pieces for 19.25$. I understand lunch menu can be slightly different on a week day but this is not how they should treat the customers-even in a regular sushi shop or sushi man a chain for take out sushi which is made very fast) they serve more than 2 different kind of sushi in a box has 14 pieces and cheaper than 19.25$. Overprice for ordinary food is unacceptable, seriously. There should be difference between food chain restaurants and actual restaurant-why should I come here and pay this much money if I can get better food in a food court for lower price?"}
{"text":"A small place hidden in one of the most non-pretentious streets. I loved it. The ambience is beautiful with a cozy feel. Their taster platter is a must try. A sushi fan or not, you should definitely try this place. It is a little more expensive when compared to other places. However, you will know why, once you have dined there :) Each of its sushi is a special craft delight. It is hard to tell which one is my favorite!! Note to visitors: a small place, with line up. Very busy always. You would want to book in advance. Also, no alcohol served. But you won't miss it!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. Staff is super friendly and welcoming! You must give it a try and the sushi are terrific as well!"}
{"text":"Très bon mais un peu chère. Les poduits sont frais et de très bonne qualité.  Le personnel est très sympathique. Le restaurant est petit donc on peut attendre longtemps si le restaurant est plein."}
{"text":"Saint Sushi got such great reviews, that I just had to try it for myself and it was every bit as good as expected ! The location isn't huge and fills up fast, so definitely make a reservation if you're going at peak times. The staff were so friendly and on point and the atmosphere was a lot of fun (Casual but still a sit down place, great for a date!), especially being seated at the bar where you can watch the super talented chefs work their magic and ask them first hand for their recommendations ! The sushi was delicious , great presentation and prepared with care. The fish was so fresh and their flavor combos aren't your typical every day rolls but they were all well thought out and tasted great.  By far , the order to take is the chef's choice tasting menu, its so much food for such a great price and allows you to try things you may not have thought to on your own (Its 3 courses, starting with Sashimi, what they call a christmas tree which is comparable to a really great tartar, and then a mix of various Maki Rolls, all of which were outstanding). Just one thing to note , they don't serve alcohol and limited choice of beverages. Not gonna lie , I can eat alot of food and I can safely say the tasting menu left me full and satisfied, well worth the price. I am definitely planning to come back here again and again to curb that ever present sushi craving !"}
{"text":"Honestly speaking, I am disappointed since it has 4.5 star. We tried the tasting menu and found out that everything in the menu was exactly the same with the chef's choice of Tri Express, the best sushi bar in Montreal to me. I am not sure which one is original but I would say I prefer Tri Express."}
{"text":"4.5 stars, actually, but I'm rounding up. Loved eating at the Saint, and-but I am not a sushi eater. I do not like fish!  I had the maki végé and it was so so so delicious and had the most interesting textures that my mouth wanted more.  There was creaminess and crunch along with the obvious rice and seaweed.  It was disconcerting and awesome.  The only complaint my friends and I had was that it wasn't enough, so we had to order seconds...but the seconds were well worth it.  The green tea with popcorn was out of sight.  My friends ordered the Bob Marley and loved it.    It's a strange atmosphere - guys from Jamaica? Seating like some Quebec sugar shack.  I thought it was a great combo of influences.  Really knocked out every expectation I had, and then snuck in an amazing experience.    This resto is on the same street as the more obvious players - you'll be smelling the Italian and Green restaurants nearby - but you should not be swayed from your mission of eating at this unique and delectable place."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS I came here twice, once on a first date and the other time with my family The atmosphere is great, very hip and buzzing yet at the same time quite cozy The food is affordable and the sashimi in particular was great The wait isn't too bad, and you can see the chef make the food in front of you since the kitchen is practically in the middle of the restaurant The girl I brought really liked it ;)  The second time I came was with my family, and the wait was EXTREMELY long (over an hour total once we sat down). However, they provided us with complimentary salmon tartar for our wait which tasted amazing. We ordered a shitload of food that all came at once and was all delicious, the quality of sushi here is very top notch for such an affordable price (maybe 15-20$ per person) I would definitely recommend to anyone who-  Actually, just anyone."}
{"text":"I ate here in early August, 2015, on a Saturday evening. I arrived probably 30 minutes before closing  but figured sushi couldn't take very long. The space is small but cozy rather than cramped. Folks waiting for a table were asked to do so outside. There were three couples waiting ahead of me and the wait took about 15 minutes. The staff were great, attentive and friendly. My food specifications were happily accommodated. The sushi... sushi was crafted, yes crafted, and came to the table quickly. And it was delicious!! The flavors and textures were so unique. I've eaten a lot of sushi in a lot of different travel locations and SSB is definitely in the top three. This was my first visit to Montreal and this meal capped off a great experience. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Strangely enough this was our first stop on a recent visit to Montreal. We had been driving all day and wanted something light and close by for dinner. I took out my list of places to check out and we landed here (a short walk from our hotel on St. Denis).   We didn't realize it, but we arrived 5 minutes before they were closing. The place was packed and the owner quickly greeted us and said two seats would be opening up soon. He was right and we quickly got two seats at the bar.   We were surprised to see the menu was in French only (oh no!), but one of the sushi chefs helped us immediately when he realized we spoke only English. He recommended doing the tasting menu so we did. All of the rolls are named after famous musicians which was really fun. Everything was fresh and absolutely delicious! Our favorite was the Beatles roll with mushrooms. It was fun to watch the chefs make the rolls and I was so impressed with the friendliness of the owner and other staff. They were extremely nice especially since it was so close to quitting time. I know people probably don't go to Montreal for sushi per se, but we really enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this place based on previous reviews. Small place but it's what adds to the charm. I'm normally an American sushi eater but was convinced to try some of their various samples with ingredients in typically don't like (mango, mushroom sprouts, etc). I'm glad I did. The food was absolutely fantastic!! I will be back the next time I'm here. They've only been open for two years but the place was packed so you know it's good. Chefs are super friendly. Definitely stop here when you get a chance."}
{"text":"3.5 is my rating.  My coworker was craving for sushi so we stumbled over this place and decided to give it a try. Love the deco - it's a very hippy modern sushi restaurant, not your typical traditional sushi place. I decided to go with the tasting menu ($25.50) First dish was a salmon carpaccio, with 2 pieces of salmon sashimi topped with shredded green apple. The green apple added a nice refreshing crunch to the dish. Second dish were the Christmas trees. Essentially they were mixed lobster meat with tempura bits and spicy mayo stacked into a tree shape topped on a rice cracker. They have different types of filling for the Christmas trees - my coworker ordered the salmon one. I actually think I liked that one more. They called it lobster meat but I think it was just diced up imitation crab meat. The Last dish were the 2 rolls - there were 5 pieces of the Madonna Maki roll, and 6 pieces of  the Salmon Sensi roll. The Madonna maki was stuffed with salmon, mango, cucumbers, and avocado. The Sensi roll was stuffed with salmon mixed in tempura bits, lettuce, cucumbers, and avocado wrapped in rice paper. Very interesting twist in sushi rolls and tasted really refreshing. I liked how both rolls weren't stuffed with rice, and instead with a lot of other vegetable ingredients.  A decent amount of food for one person - well worth the value."}
{"text":"Great tasting menu deal for $23.50 incl tax. Recommend coming here if you're craving sushi! A lot of the rolls are spicy salmon based with some variation. The guys at the counter making sushi are a fun group that engages with the customers. The tasting menu encompasses 3 courses: for starter, the salmon and tuna sashimi with Apple salad on top, second part of the course is what they call  \"Christmas trees\" which is piled on spicy salmon and lobster over a rice cracker (so so good!), and the third course is various sushi rolls which kind of all pretty similar in terms of taste (predominately spicy salmon or tuna based) with different complementary ingredients. I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and the service! Would come back here again when I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I love this sushi resto! I've been here a handful of times and I always get the tasting menu. It never disappoints. I find its better when you go in a bigger group because then they give you more variety of sushi to try. The service is very fast and the tasting menu is filling. I always bring people here because it's good and fairly inexpensive. It's $25.50 for three courses. The only downside is that they don't serve alcohol!!  it's really too bad.   My favorite thing on the menu is the Christmas tree. I've had the salmon and the lobster and both are delicious! It's super tasty and crunchy. The tasting menu also comes with salmon sashimi with apples cut julienne style and a vinaigrette. For two people they also give with four different maki rolls and two sauces. One is a spicy mayo and one is a vinaigrette. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"The decor of Saint Sushi Bar doesn't follow your typical Japanese restaurant. Really, I thought that I was in some sort of Indo-Thai restaurant. But just as unconventional as the decor was, the menu was amazing.   Named after pop culture's famous icons, each sushi roll was as unique as the people it represented. No, you won't just taste a massive whiff of spicy mayo in each but you'll actually get to taste intriguing combinations of flavors. Which is why the tasting platter is an excellent choice. Don't worry, there are traditional sushi in the menu but the \"celebrity\" ones are must tries.   On top of excellent creative sushi, the staffs were extremely down to earth. My jokes were replied with more jokes coming from the waitress, one of the chefs kept telling us across two tables to not hesitate if we had any questions, another member showed serious concerns about my friend's broken finger which was wrapped in a cast and wished for her well-being. It felt as if we were welcomed not as clients but as professional friends.  Saint Sushi Bar really deserves a top spot on Yelp. Do yourself a favor and add this place to your food bucket list."}
{"text":"Un secret bien gardé, des sushis créatifs et succulents qui ne sont pas dans rappeler ceux d'un maître sushis de la rue Laurier, j'y retourne bientôt, c'est sûr!"}
{"text":"Super belle ambiance et excellent sushis! Les serveurs sont sympas et font de bonnes suggestions. J'ai hâte d'y retourner!"}
{"text":"Cool twist to traditional Japanese sushi. The presentation is always beautiful and the sushi is super fresh. Sit at the bar and catch it up with the sushi chefs. They're entertaining to talk to and quite humorous. The restaurant itself is very small so if you plan to dine in, make it a date rather a group hang."}
{"text":"Thought I'd do a Montreal review since i'm on the road this month and feeling a bit homesick. I miss my Saint Sushi Bar love love you guys you make some solid sushi. Its a whole different kind of fusion sushi and really adorable for date night. I am so missing it!"}
{"text":"Un sans faute pour ce restaurant japonais proposant sushis makis et sashimis. Rien à voir avec les sushis que l'on peut trouver en France, avec des ingredients basiques, et peu de mélanges. Le midi deux menus sont proposés: adam et eve suivant votre faim. C'est le chef qui décide ce qu'il vous met dans l'assiette mais n'ayez crainte, c'est TRES TRES BON! Pour notre part nous avons pu tester les \"madonna\" et les \"bob marley\". Assaisonnement de mayonnaise épicée, de yaourt, des mélanges thon/saumon, des tobikos et masagos (je me la pete, mais ce sont des oeufs de poisson :) ) et plein de verdure! Le menu est aussi accompagné au choix d'une salade thai ou d'une soupe miso délicieuse, très parfumée et généreusement garnie.  Le service est très agréable et sait nous conseiller dans nos choix.  Y aller sans hésiter!"}
{"text":"I came here last night  since I've been craving sushi lately and after reading fellow Yelper's reviews, I decided to come check it out.  Believe the hype.  I find most really good sushi joints in Montreal fall either between the food-court variety  or the super, high-end, astronomically priced variety. Finding something decent in the middle is a tricky act to follow. However, Saint Sushi delivers on all points.  Not only is it moderately priced, you get lots of bang for your buck. The flavors are just simply amazing. With a  hip attitude and tasting menus named after gangsters like \"Bonnie\" or \"Clyde\" or maki rolls named after singers like James Brown or Madonna, if you like trying out unique sushi flavors, then come here.  Their \"Sapins de Noel\" (Christmas tree) is a particular delight,. Lobster on a rice cracker, it's a wonderful, unique take. Then there's the ambiance and service. The guys running the place are really nice and friendly, they want to make your experience a positive one and it really shows. Plus there were all these great 80's tunes playing, with a mix which went from \"We are the World\" to \"Grease\" to \"Home Sweet Home\" from Motley Crue.  I felt like I was suddenly back in the fifth grade listening to the radio while noshing on great food.  So with great tunes, great service, great food and great prices, please pray tell, why would I want to go anywhere else for sushi now?"}
{"text":"This is definitely not an authentic sushi restaurant... The chefs here are artists and their creations are both whimsical and unconventional. Their sushi is beautiful and so so so tasty!!! Every bite is an explosion of flavours.   The service is great... Waiters were super friendly with everyone.   I almost didn't want to write this review because they are already so busy and I didn't want to jeopardize my chances of getting a table in the future.... But I felt compelled to let you know how fabulous this tiny restaurant is. For first timers, definitely go with the sampling menu: truly a wonderfully delicious experience."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in Montreal! The food, the atmosphere.. Phenominal! We had the tasting menu, and we got to try the best off their menu! The christmas tree starter was divine, every roll had a myriad of tastes that made it very difficult to choose which was the best. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Directement sur le plateau avec une ambiance chaleureuse et invitante. Des hits de musique des années 80, 90 et 2000.  Le menu est intéressant avec des noms de makis originaux : toutefois, ils ressemblent beaucoup à ceux qu'on peut commander dans d'autres restaurants de sushi. Le goût est très respectable. Si vous ne voulez pas vous casser la tête, essayer le menu dégustation qui est très bien balancé."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Saint Sushi. The tasting menu was really delicious. Make a reservation to save yourself any grief.   The michael jackson roll was very good. The Christmas Tree was good too. The staff is very friendly and lots of fun.  Overall, a nice place to enjoy some fusion Sushi.  If you are in Montreal, pass by and check it out. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"We took the tasting menu, and we shared it between three people but were still incredibly full afterwards, so the portions are good, but i just thought everything tasted really similar so i got sick of it quickly. Personally, i just thought the sushi was just over complicated, and too much stuff was in it. Also, I ordered the miso soup but it was super salty and not worth it. Overall the sushi was okay."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my trusted Yelp friend, Brian C and the place did not disappoint. We got the tasting menu and I still can't believe how tasty it was and reasonably priced, it felt like that Ikea commercial where the woman buys a bunch of stuff and starts running out and yelling at her husband to \"start the car!\" The warm Michael Jackson roll was my fave, but all of the fish tasted so good and the rolls were all different enough to make me think that I was back in Vancouver eating close to the ocean and not deep in the heart of the Plateau.  The staff here are all so much fun and laughed with us, gave us thorough explanations of everything and made us feel welcome. Next time I go, I'll definitely sit at the bar because that looked like even more fun. This place draws people of all ages and the presentation of the food somehow is so gorgeous despite how quickly they were able to get it prepared and onto our table.  The only sorta bummer here is that they don't have a liquor licence and you can't bring your own, but hey, it keeps people moving in and out quickly, so you'll never have to wait long for a table. Reservations are highly recommended as the space is fairly small."}
{"text":"Really unique place. Everyone working there seemed to be having a great time.   Really interesting sushi creations. I would follow your server's recommendations."}
{"text":"Top resto. Excellents such.  On s est régalé !  (Gaelle, travel agent. Brussels /Belgium)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent a long weekend in Montreal and were craving some delicious sushi during our last night. We were pleasantly surprised to find Saint Sushi Bar within walking distance of our AirBNB. The wait staff was very insightful when it came to figuring out what to order. They we're also friendly and kept a fun conversation going with us. I would have given them a 5, but I was unable to wash down our meal with some Asahi or Saki as they're a dry restaurant. Next time we head to Montreal, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"A total treat. Exceptional warm service, we didn't have reservations and the place was packed but one of the owners made room for us at the bar in short order. We had the tasting menu and the $22 price is a steal. Looking at the Yelp reviews ahead of time wasn't sure what $22 would get you, but the quality of the fare was on the level of a hundred dollars a head tasting menus and the friendly chefs and staff made it a superb experience. Dig the cool kung fu hip hop vibe they got going too. In passing praise to the owner he said that they wanted to make a place people love going to - mission accomplished, judging by how everyone else there seemed to be having the se quality experience. Particular stand outs were the rice cracker business they have and the chefs checking in to tweak things even closer to individual tastes. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My partner and I moved from Vancouver, and have really been struggling to find a sushi place we like in Montreal and FINALLY we found one! We really loved it, and it was pretty reasonable for pricing. There were lots of creative items on the menu, but we did also order a lot of the classics - and they were great.   The combination of decorative styles was a nice touch too."}
{"text":"sushi they have is good although i wouldn't call them that way. don't get me wrong, it was delicious, however it wasn't sushi. great ambiance. Prices are a bit on an expensive side though"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much when my daughter told me we were having sushi while visiting Montreal. But Saint Sushi blew me away in a good way. Did the tasting menu which allowed us to sample a variety of their offerings. Very creative and non traditional sushi and sashimi.  All very fresh and tasty. Great prices and a friendly and quirky staff that makes it fun."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Tri Express, you will definitely love Sushi Saint because the menu, concept and presentation is exactly the same. In fact, it's pretty much a carbon copy of Tri Express. It turns out that the chef had previously worked for 6 years at Tri Express before opening his own restaurant.   My wife and I went for the tasting menu, which is not listed on the menu. At 20$ per person, it's a great deal although I wasn't full at the end of my meal.  I enjoyed my meal although I felt bad that the chef blatantly copied another restaurant. I tried to enjoy my meal for what it is: a playful interpretation of sushi. Japanese natives would probably not believe what happened to their beloved sushi. The focus is not on the freshness of the fish. In fact, I could sometimes barely tell what kind of fish I was eating.   An extra star for the music soundtrack that was playing. 80s music is awesome!"}
{"text":"Endroit accueillant, staff vraiment très sympathique, grosseur de Resto parfaite à mon avis (peut-être une vingtaine de places assises?), et les sushis; vraiment très bons, frais, fait avec attention et créativité. J'ai vraiment hâte qu'ils obtiennent leur permis d'alcool...je reviendrai certainement plus qu'une fois par année quand ce sera le cas."}
{"text":"I was very unimpressed. With such high ratings, I was expecting a lot more. I had the 1person prix fix which included salmon sashimi with Apple, two small bite called Christmas tree, and 2 rolls. I enjoyed the Christmas tree small bites but it was again repeated in my rolls. A little overkill. It's delicious because I think they mixed in ritz crackers crumbles in the lobster slaw. Just a guess!   Very Hawaiian style sushi dining which is good but maybe not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"This is a casual romantic place to take your date. It is a fusion sushi place very similar to Tri Express. The decor is very basic but the food is very good. You can order from the fix to taste a variety of their most wanted sushi. You will not leave the place disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in Montreal! Been going there for the past 2 years. Great team and delicious food. Pay attention to the chefs, you'll see them sing and dance lol"}
{"text":"This is my most recent surprising and astonishing finds on the plateau recently. The sushi is 5 star, the service is perfect, location is adorable and well decorated.....the price is unbelievable!!!! You can eat lunch here for the under 15$ seriously??? AMAZING"}
{"text":"I love eating! I love food and love sushi! But where i live... I don't get to eat good sushi. But this place!!! Oh my! Sooooo good and refreshing! If you're expecting authentic sushi, this might not be the place for you. Although... most sushi place aren't that \"authentic\" right?? But the flavour combinations are very good! Felix and I each took the \"menu dégustation\" which was suggested by the waiter. And he told us that we would have a very good variety of sushies plus a miso soup. We took it to go because the place was jammed packed! So, the soup is very tasty. Full of umami flavours. The sashimi, fresh. The sushis, delicious! The staff, super nice, helpful...did i say nice? It's only a 7 minutes drive from my place so doable. The only downside is the traffic and parking around there. It's almost impossible to find something without getting annoyed by all the construction work in that area. But please. Go give it a try. Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Without any hesitation, this is best sushi I've had in Montréal. What sweetens the deal is that this is legit a little hole-in-the-wall with likely the most eclectic decor I've seen in a while. The open kitchen allows you to watch this teams of young rag-tag dudes totally kill this sushi business, with exceptionally fun and fast service.  I ordered the tasting plate, which ends up being a good deal, however if you're really hungry I'd maybe order something extra on the side.    Tip: don't be like me and not have a reservation. Emphasis on how awesome and tiny this place is: book your seats in advance."}
{"text":"The sushi chefs were very kind and guided me in what to order as I sat at the bar. The restaurant itself has limited seating and gets pretty crowded. You have to walk up to the register to Pay.   The sushi tower was delicious atop the crispy rice cracker and their naming convention was entertaining. I mean, who doesn't want a Michael Jackson roll?   The guys might take their shirts off and dance if you tip them enough."}
{"text":"Had the dégustation menu and pizza sushi. The tuna pizza sushi was the best pizza sushi I ever had. The sapin sushi was also great. You won't be disappointed. The staff is very friendly and diverse"}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars cuz the sushi was really that good!  They put a jug of water on the table when you arrive.  They have English menus.  It's a pretty small resto. Need to make a reservation in advance.  Has a chill vibe.  Got the apple tuna sashimi for the appetizer and it was really good.  Got a bunch of makis and they removed the salmon for me.  They don't have any desserts. But there is a dep right next door and hubby bought me chocolate.  It's on Duluth but not a BYO.   Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Salmon Christmas Tree was out of this world. No was the nicest and everyone at the restaurant was extremely hospitable!"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday since my wife and I craved sushi for quite some time. This place had high reviews here at yelp and they were accurate.   We had the plat de degustation and every bite and piece of food were delicious. We ordered some additional more makis to try out more of the creations the restaurant had to offer and were also pleased. The side sauces were excellent and definitely elevated the food to a different height (loved the Saki reduction).  The service and staff were very helpful and even when I accidently spilled the soya sauce on the table, the waiter was very courteous and didn't make me feel bad about the accident. The music choice was great especially for 80s generation  The only negative point (even through no fault of the owners) is the lack of any alcohol license (including bring your own). The waiter told us that they were working on it but it was not easy task.  I would definitely come back and recommend the place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"We ordered the lunch special and it was really flavorful and filling, without feeling heavy. Fresh food, quick service, and plenty of room in the restaurant. Definitely going to be going back again"}
