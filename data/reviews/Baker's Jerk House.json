{"text":"Hands down the best in Brampton. I have to eat here at least once a week. Good job on the consistent quality of food. I know it gets busy but worth the wait for me."}
{"text":"one of the best and favorable Jamaican restaurant of all times. Food is super good..staff are fantastic. I have tried many many different Jamaican restaurants from fancy ones to regular and this by far stands out."}
{"text":"This is to update my review that quality and taste has lot improved since my last visit ! I will definitely go again and will update again ! Continue good work guys - way to go !!"}
{"text":"5stars  Great food.   Pretty sure they win best jerk chicken at jerk fest every time they enter.    The food here is best    Love it."}
{"text":"Just tried this for the first time.  The chicken was so juicy and such a great flavour! We ordered jerk chicken,  rice and  pasta salad.   Jerk Chicken was delish! But the only real downfall was there was a lot of pieces of bones. Like small shards of bones not sure if this was caused by the way it was chopped. But for chicken Breast it was disappointing  And a little annoying. I like to stuff my face :) but I was so worried about taking big bites Otherwise it would have been 5 star. Not sure if this is common maybe I should call to let them know.   Rice and peas with oxtail gravy. Very good. Great flavour   Pasta salad had a great flavour. Next time I will order more. :).   I just hope next time if I try it. The chicken don't have tiny pieces of bones. Otherwise I won't go. Which I will be sad because it was super yummy."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE. The food is ok. Never have the full displayed menu of food items and the customer service is atrocious! Unless you have absolutely nothing to do with your time. Do not go here"}
{"text":"The jerk chicken here is the best I have tasted outside of Jamaica, make sure to try it with the pasta salad."}
{"text":"Good food.  I especially like the pasta salad.  Only poor comment is that they don't even give you a full 2 pieces of chicken with the special.  Like really?  What's the point of cutting a piece of the chicken off?  Leg and thigh is pretty standard for a special.  I found it cheap and mean that they cut a piece off.  The food does taste good though.  I bought chicken for 79 cents a pound last week..  just saying. .  Mean management"}
{"text":"Went here with a recommendation from my brother, but I don't think we'll be returning.    There were 3 customers in front of us and it took about 20-25 minutes to get our food.  Very slow service and not very friendly either.  My husband ordered the jerk chicken dinner with coleslaw and I had the curry goat with coleslaw.  The jerk chicken wasn't what hubby expected...there was sweetness and no heat.  My curry goat on the other hand was extremely spicy.  I can handle spice but not the level that was given.  Not what I'm used to for curry goat.  My hubby and I ended up switching our meals since he loves hot and spicy, and even for him the curry goat was not enjoyable.  Luckily the coleslaw (which was good) helped a bit."}
{"text":"This is a must if it's lunch time and I am in the nieghbourhood!! Great lunch deal with amazing smoked jerked chicken or bbq chicken (I can't pick my favourite!) with rice (make sure you add the oxtail gravy!!) and the best pasta salad ive had in a really long time!! Consistant and always great and friendly!!"}
{"text":"Wow! It's a festival of flavour in your mouth. The flavours are Authentic and not overpowered with salt. By far one of the better Caribbean cuisine I have tried. Customer service is exceptionally the best I've ever had at a jerk joint!"}
{"text":"This place has the best jerk and oxtail I've ever had. I'm so happy my buddy in Brampton showed me this place. Their daily specials before 3pm are a steal!"}
{"text":"I always go for their jerk chicken special at lunch time and it's always consistently good, never had a bad meal. Customer service is always on point, staff are friendly and polite. One time a staff member made a mistake with my order, thought I ordered fried chicken instead of jerk and as a goodwill gesture added a piece of fried chicken to my order.  It wasn't necessary because the mistake was quickly identified and remedied but it's that extra attention to client satisfaction that distinguishes them from other West Indian restaurants where customer service can be severely lacking or non-existent."}
{"text":"This place right here is what you call real authentic Jamaican food! The owner is wonderful, front staff is great and the food is awesome. Though it is small inside, there isn't really much room for you to have a seat and enjoy your meal. My first visit I was able to reach just in time for the lunch special (5$ plus tax) which gives you the option of jerk chicken/fried chicken/BBQ chicken served with rice&peas, salad and a drink.   So I decided to go with the fried chicken option and ohh boy it was probably the best decision I made that day LOL! Not only was the chicken fried to almost perfection but the famous red sauce in which tops off the chicken adds such great flavour. I would suggest for the salad option to go with the pasta salad. Portion size you get a great deal for your dollar. If you're feeling very hungry that day I would go with a large which is around 10.00$ still a good deal. I would definitely recommend visiting this place!"}
{"text":"Located in a small plaza at the intersection of Bovaird St East and Sunnyvale Gate stands a small family run jerk house.  I've always asked where to get some real good jerk chicken and Baker's Jerk was constantly recommended to me. The store features an assortment of different dinners they offered such as curry chicken, jerk chicken, curry goat, oxtail and so on.  But to put some credibility to these reccomendations I ordered the large jerk chicken dinner that came up to $11.30 even though the person in front of me ordered the curry goat it looked irresistible (next time).  Honestly I have to apologize for not taking a picture. But it was that good. I got to say that everything in that dinner made it well worth it to try. The Chicken Dinner came with rice and beans, pasta salad (that looked like mac & cheese) and 4 pieces of jerk chicken. All aspects of this dinner was phenomenal! I first tried the pasta salad and it as this creamy, subtle tangy and rich flavour to it that I wish I got more of. The rice and beans had a jerk sauce that added to it's flavour. But oh the jerk chicken... it was absolutely heavenly. The jerk chicken was really tender and was completely easy to eat every meat to the bone.   My tip would be to ask for the chicken gravy on top of the jerk chicken which adds more to the flavour.  I would honestly come back here to try their oxtail dinner and curry goat dinner because I really craved it when I came today  I would honestly do the same my friends have told me and reccomend this to anyone who wants quality jerk chicken"}
{"text":"I was craving jerk chicken since last week. I was in this area and wanted to try this Caribbean joint so thought of having lunch here.  I got the jerk chicken lunch special. It was a good meal for good price. Though it was just simple food, nothing special about it.  Normally I like jerk chicken to have some heat, this one is not that spicy. But overall it was good food, service was really good, lady at counter was very helpful.  If I am in that area again, I will surely go back again."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time, and really enjoyed it. I got the jerk chicken (small portion) which came with a whole chicken leg. It had a smoky flavor, and it tasted great. I also asked for half macaroni and half rice. It was great. The chicken is not as spicy as I would have preferred, but the seasoning is really good. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Jerk Chicken for sure!!! Tender and delicious.   Not too sure about everything else.  The King fish was dry and wasn't a fan of the OX tail.  The pasta salad was full of sugar. I don't know if that's what authentic Jamaican salads are like, but way too sweet for me.   And the line up during lunch was just terrible. One person takes the order, goes to the back, comes back a while later, brings out the bag, finishes the cash transaction....they need a better system.   I don't know why Yelp says it's good for groups. It's a take out place. I brought a couple of buddys for lunch and all there were two dirty stools and a small bar table by the window."}
{"text":"Ive had Baker's Jerk on several occasion and I love their food..  But recently for my engagement party we catered food from them, and Kirk was just awesome with his service and food preparation !!! He really went all out and made the chicken and goat taste really good.  And the Plantains were cooked just right, I am very glad we had Bakers Jerk cater for us.  In all my years of going to events, or hosting, I have never seen food finish...well at our party, the food was done in about 45 mins !!! Thats how good it was"}
{"text":"My visit to Baker's Jerk House was on a rainy, cold, winter day. It was one of the businesses I had wanted to try on my list of food places near my workplace.   I had the jerk chicken dinner with rice and pasta. It was a solid meal, and the portions were good, but there just wasn't anything special about it. Simply put, it wasn't a meal I'd write home about. The pasta, however, was a nice touch, as most Caribbean places do not offer anything similar.  This isn't a bad thing - in fact, it's more or less what I expected from a small jerk shop in a plaza situated in a residential area.   I'm sure the locals love the place as it provides solid Caribbean food at a decent price. However, for those making a trip to the area, there are far more intriguing options that I would choose over Baker's Jerk."}
{"text":"YOOOOOO. Omg, I can't believe it took me these many years to finally try Baker's.  I can't believe how good it was!  Dare I say it?  Their oxtail is defs comparable to Portland's!  It was soooo tender, fall-off the bone juicy.  Nothing missing.  It was really on point!  I really like that they offer 3 different types of salad with your meal (pasta salad, garden and coleslaw).  From reading reviews, I knew I had to go with the pasta salad.  I'm not a fan of coleslaw to begin with.  Pasta salad was such a great addition to my meal.  If you're having something really spicy, the salad is so creamy, guaranteed to cool down the heat. I bought my friend a jerk chicken meal and he would not stop going on about how good the food was.  So I had a little piece of his chicken and the first words out of my mouth were 'holy sh*t'.  Girl, I was shook!  I was not expecting the chicken to be that good.  I don't usually get jerk chicken because I'm an oxtail girl but daaamn,  This chicken hit every point!  Juicy, also fall off the bone and bursting with flavour.  I'm actually really excited to come back.  I want to try everything!  I don't know what else to say because I've basically let y'all know the two meals I got were bomb.  So, go!  Go try it now.  It was pretty poppin on a Saturday evening.  I can only imagine how busy it gets here at lunch."}
{"text":"The food is really good, absolutely no complaints there.   What bothered me a lot was how slow they move.  The 3 times I've gone, there were no more than 3 other people waiting, but the amount of time just to take my order, and then the amount of time to receive my order was ridiculous.  They could stand to work a little more efficiently. They're the closest Caribbean place to my house but I tend to opt for further options because I know it wouldn't take as long."}
{"text":"Omg this is my favourite place to go to when I'm craving jerk chicken! The chicken leg is actually so big and meaty compared to most places Ive been to that serves the skinniest chicken leg ever. The chicken is so tender and juicy, it falls right off the bone when I bit into it  to compliment the jerk chicken & rice and peas, bakers jerk has a pasta salad side (definitely recommend)! It's sweet (not overly sweet) and goes so well with the entire dish!   It is located in a pretty busy plaza (or at least the times when I go), so I usually park on the other side of the place and walk over. Bakers Jerk is more of a take out place so don't expect any tables, but the service is still really good for a take out location. I get my order reallyyy quick.. you know there are some take out places that still take FOREVER to give you your food? Not here!!   From what I remember, it is $8 for a small and $10 for a large jerk chicken. I always get the large  and surprisingly I finish it! I usually don't finish my meals but this is just too good I can't stop myself lol!   I definitely recommend visiting bakers jerk if you're in the mood for some jerk chicken. That's the only thing I've ever tried there but judging from other reviews, their other food must be as good as well. You won't be disappointed, promise! :)"}
{"text":"Great place for w cheap lunch meal! It was my first time coming here as I was looking for new places to eat besides Tim Hortons near my work. The service is relatively slow and there are only 2 places to sit, but the service was very good however slow. Nonetheless  worth the 5.68 cents comes with a drink. The jerk chicken is not too spicy. I have to try the other items! Good job highly recommend"}
{"text":"Dropped by during lunch, good place to try out, great service and friendly environment. Take out only, unless you're lucky enough to grab the only two seats. Took about 5-10 mins to get the food, wasn't too busy either. Ordered the Chicken Roti - decent size for a roti, good flavour but lacked any form of heat. The other person I was with ordered the Curry Goat, more complex flavours than the Roti and would recommend it over the Chicken Roti. Overall if I were in the area and were hungry, I'd drop by!"}
{"text":"If I'm in the area I always stop for some jerk and a beef patty while I wait. They do it pretty good here and they have nice workers. It seems like the food is much more fresh than a lot of other jerk places around."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for Jerk chicken in brampton. They replace coleslaw with their pasta which is good. Only downfall, dont go there evening time on a friday. You'll be waiting outside."}
{"text":"I remember eating here a couple of months ago.. i forgot to leave a review. It was good.. Of course I had better, but they are not bad at all and I enjoyed my food."}
{"text":"good food. great prices. friendly staff. you can call before hand for pick up orders. located Newry public transportation and public parking. I'd recommend this place for their jerk chicken. but their menu has a wide variety of dishes."}
