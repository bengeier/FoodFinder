{"text":"Found this place very close to my work. superb food and smiling customer service all around. tried their chicken, cod fish and salmon and all of them were just perfect. They have tarts and cappuccino as well for desert which is worth a try. great joint for lunch or diner. Highly recomended"}
{"text":"Came here with my mom. The place is nice. The waitress was super friendly. The food was tasty and filling. The only downside is that the washroom is located in the basement, but for most people that's not a problem. Definitely going to come back."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many of times and was always curious and thought one day I have to stop in. Well today was the day that I randomly remembered this place and on my way home decided to go and check it out. It's a very small place but has a nice mom & pop feel to it, you can tell immediately that this is a \"neighbourhood spot\" and the staff pretty much knew most of the customers dining in there by name.   I decided to grab take out rather than dine in, I ordered the half chicken combo for $10.00, the lady behind the counter was very friendly and took my order and told me that it wouldn't take too long. There was about 2 other customers ahead of me and a dining room behind me that was starting to fill up fast. While I was waiting i was checking out all the hot food items they had displayed in chafing pans behind the glass and i must say everything looked fresh, home-made and very appetising. Finally after 15 minutes my food arrived the lady behind the counter thanked me for my patience i grabbed my food and went home anxiously anticipating opening up the take out container as the smell that was coming out of that box was driving me crazy it was so good.  Finally I get home and when i opened the container I was disappointed that they gave me rice instead of the vegetables that I had ordered but I soon forgot all about this as i started in on the chicken. The chicken was so well seasoned and moist and it had that wonderful  BBQ rotisserie char taste by far one of the best Portuguese chickens i have had in a long time. The Persian potatoes were ok nothing to really write home about and since the rice was already there i decided to taste it and I was pleasantly surprised it had a really nice flavour.   All in all folks the food was solid, the portion of food was fantastic for the price point, I will definitely be going back here and bringing some friends/family along for the ride."}
{"text":"Chinese=0.50 cents extra, Portuguese=free!  The lunch is amazing-delicious, fresh chicken with some parisienne potatoes and veggies, or rice.  Hot sauce on top and we're happy people.  We went back a few times for take out for lunch but then, disaster struck:  they charged me for the bread.    People behind me in line ordered in Portuguese, bread was thrown in the bag and down the line we went.  I asked the dude if the bread was extra, he said no!  So Chinese me was charged .50 cents, for bread, but if you're Portuguese, lucky you, you'll be saving some money!    One star for the chicken, one star for the hot sauce.  No stars for bread money.    Never been back since."}
{"text":"This is decent food, not fancy, just plain and good and very filling.   Good chicken, it's always made to order. Good coleslaw, a tad heavy on the celery seed but still good. Deep fried frozen fries, a bit meh but it's deep fried so whatever. Hand washed and cut salad, nice. I like their chicken pie: moist shredded chicken and vegetables topped with mashed potatoes. Very comforting on a cold day. Hot table offerings change daily. The \"small\" meal is huge already and can feed two people so it's not a bad choice for takeout on the way home because you can either pig out, split it with another person or save it for a meal tomorrow.  A wide variety of choices for a small restaurant. If you're into octopus and chickpea salad, they've got it too. I think it's an acquired taste because I thought they nailed the texture of the octopus even though I didn't personally care for the taste or the texture of it. However, I think it was more jarring just because I thought it was red onions until I opened the box (bad eyesight on my part)."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. It's a cross between a restaurant and a hot table. Most items are on the hot table but they can make you certain things upon request. The fish is fantastic. Halibut, grouper, cod, salmon have never disappointed. Seafood is hit and miss. I think the rice has nice flavor however the parisienne potatoes are always overcooked. Lots of cold side salad choices like potato salad, macaroni salad, chick peas with octopus, cucumber n tomatoes etc. Take-out is fastest as you just grab n go but if you want to dine in I suggest you grab the food at the counter then sit down. Keep in mind you are expected to tip since there are servers unlike many other Portuguese joints where you can just pay sit eat and leave There is seasonal outdoor seating. Prices vary between $10-$15 for a meal not incl drink. Menu changes daily. Located at dufferin and glencairn. Very limited parking behind. Street parking on glencairn"}
{"text":"I usually get takeout, but sometimes I dine in. The service from all the female staff is excellent, but don't expect a smile from the owner. He's pretty miserable.  The food is hit and miss. But when it's a hit it's very good. The chicken is some of the best Portuguese chicken I've had. The only problem is that occasionally (1 out of 5) the chicken is dry and tastes old.  I still keep going back. It's convenient. I've tried Estrella and Costa Verde, they are all about the same."}
{"text":"Okay, had several neighbours say \"Oh you should go there the food is great\".  Well finally dropped in and must say not overly impressed.  walked in sat, waited, waved... \"I'll be right with you\"... sat waited waved \"Yes just one moment and I will explain\"... waited while the local Portuguese chat fest went on.  Finally found out no menu, its on the board, order a main and two sides blah blah blah. Both of us ordered calamari one lunch one dinner size (order the small there is not that much a difference for the cash),   had sides of bland rice and undercooked veg that that knife could not even cut through.  Calamari was over cooked and rubbery and was gritty with sand that had not been properly rinsed off.  I asked for it to be boxed and I'd take it home, the young girl who was waitresses seemed upset that I did not want to finish and was it bad? She was the only redeeming thing purely for her concern.  But in all honesty if you want Portuguese, skip this and head to little Portugal."}
{"text":"I'm came here for the first time two weeks ago, and now I can stop... hahaha the services is awesome and the food is other level.. everything in the menu is delicious.."}
{"text":"This is a great local Portuguese chicken joint (\"Churresquiera) that offers good value for the money. Besides chicken they also offer other Portuguese cuisine. Casual atmosphere. Save room for the yummy desserts too! Licensed. Check it out and see what you think. Staff are friendly, and provide good service.  PS They also offer a very limited breakfast menu in the morning.  Closed Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Quality food, friendly service and inexpensive. The steak is delicious and you can't go wrong with breakfast for $5."}
{"text":"The food was amazing but the service can definitely be improved upon. It was a bit hectic until one of the ladies finally came over to explain their menu as they don't have menus. The older ladies are by far more upbeat than the younger one.   Food was great. Will come back here if I'm in the area and hungry. Unique tasting food."}
{"text":"Was in the Lawrence and Marlee area in the mood for some good grub. Remembered this place from about 7 years ago. My ex picked up some take out so I never had the chance to go in.   This place is pretty nice for a Portuguese chicken place. Was seated promptly and the place was quite busy.   Asked for the menu and was surprisingly told that there wasn't one. Was read the list of meats and sides.   Ordered a full chicken, small potatoes and small Greek salad.   Chicken was spot on. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The potatoes were good but were not as crispy as some other stellar places I've been to. The Greek salad looked a little lame but the taste was spot on.   All in all a great experience. Apparently all of their deserts are home made but I didn't get to try them...this time."}
{"text":"The service was great and the food came out fast! Me and a friend enjoyed the BBQ quarter chicken with rice and potatoes. I couldn't forget their dessert so we shared a strawberry cheesecake. I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have returned since my last review and tried the chicken. It tastes like it was cooked  ahead of time and grilled again when a customer orders it. The meat is extremely dry and very salty. Mains like the salmon and chicken are okay. The service is where this place loses stars. There's one woman who's very friendly, but I can't say the same about the rest of the staff. They just state at you with a face of disgust (not sure why) and just grunt at you when you have a question. Never felt so uncomfortable in my life. Anyway, there are heaps of other Portuguese chicken places that have more delicious chicken and friendlier service."}
{"text":"Good food, service and prices.  Can't go wrong with the chicken. It's always fresh where as the fried fish or other sides are from the hot table.  They also now serve breakfast till 11am"}
{"text":"Good, cheap food. May not be the best choice for someone who isn't Portuguese as there are no menus. Customer service needs improvement."}
