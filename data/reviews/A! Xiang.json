{"text":"Love this restaurant since their first location at Midland and finch. Mmmm... So good just thinking of it. 

Hot, sizzling bowl of soup comes with noodle, and 12 different kinds of ingredients on the side for you to put into your soup for your personal liking. 

I think the ingredients has enough protein. Soup is nice and hot. Rice noodle is a huge portion (for a girl). I sometimes eat half and pack the other half home for lunch the next day. 

Though there are only 3-4 pieces of beef that comes with each noodle set, the beef is very tasty. I love the beef taste (juicy, thick, and has the \"gamey\" taste). I put my beef kinna last before I put in the noodles to mix just cause I personally enjoy rare meat. The quail egg too, I like it half cooked with the yolk still in liquid form so I can mix it with that bite of noodle. 

Recommendation putting ingredients was 1. Quail egg 2. Raw meat 3. Veggies and rest of the ingredients 4. Noodle. 

(But I like in the order of 3, 1, 2, 4) lol
They have a stamp card system. Eat and collet stamps for next reward of snack or noodle. 

Prince range : $7-10 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is based off of Kunming's well-known \"Cross Bridge Noodle\" dish. 

You can choose between different soup bases (i.e. hot & spicy, tomato, etc.) and your noodles, side toppings, and soup broth all come out separately. You then dump the noodles and the ingredients into the boiling soup before mixing and eating. Most choices average around ~$8.99.

Overall I enjoy their soup broths and I think they do an okay job with the concept. One thing to watch out for is that sometimes their ground beef isn't too fresh so I would avoid putting that into your bowl if that's the case."}
{"text":"My dining experience at A! Xiang was a terrible one from start to finish.  A! Xiang takes over the spot where Jyuban Ramen House used to be. 

My mom and I were the only ones to walk in at 4:40 p.m. on a Sunday.  Right away, I recognized the old interior space of where the old ramen house used to be.  The new owners for A! Xiang had done nothing to freshen up the unit for its new business.  

There were 2 young guys working as servers during our visit.  One of them was sitting at a table using his smartphone the entire visit and the other one served us water and the menu.  Both of them were dressed in street clothes. To me, it didn't look like they were dressed appropriately for their role as servers in a restaurant at all.

I was appalled when the guy couldn't answer our question about the ingredients in The Signature Cross Bridge Rice Noodle.  He said, \"There's meat...\".  Uh, okay, but what else?!  He answered, \"There's sausage, seaweed...\" and kind of trailed off.  I thought that was completely unprofessional.  How could a server who was working in a restaurant not know or answer a customer's question about what was in the dish?! :(

Turns out there were 11 ingredients: raw beef, black fungus, seaweed, sausage, quail egg, minced meat, corn, enoki mushrooms, green beans, green onions, and white fungus.  The portions of each ingredient were very small.  

When the rice noodles and the bowl of steaming soup came out, the server literally RAN out of the kitchen with the rice noodles and soup in each hand to put on my table.  Because he was so out of control, many strands of the rice noodles actually fell on the floor and all over my table and on my plate of ingredients.  WTF.  He didn't even realize he had dropped the noodles behind him until I pointed it out:  \"Uh, you dropped all the noodles.\"  He didn't even apologize -- he simply mumbled something about the noodles and then just picked up the noodles on the floor.  I was shaking my head in disbelief.  This was so unprofessional! 

After a quick photo, I knew I needed to put the ingredients into the steaming bowl of soup right away for everything to be cooked.  I started to put the noodles into the bowl first but the server right away told me that I had to put the raw ingredients first and the noodles last.  When I tried to put in the black fungus first, he said that I had to put in the egg first.  Uh, why didn't you specify that first then?!  I felt like I was being treated as a child because I was chastised for not knowing what to put into my soup first.  The server here at A! Xiang should have pointed it out or asked if we knew how to eat Yunnan rice noodles if he was going to so particular about which ingredient I added in first. 

The taste of the soup was good; however, it tasted like it had MSG. (I was thirsty later that night.)  The rice noodles were decent and tasted nice and chewy.  The two beef slices were really rough and not the greatest.  The best part out of all the ingredients was actually the sausages.  Everything else was extremely tiny.  The enoki mushrooms had been sliced so thinly that after you placed it into the soup, it nearly disintegrated and it was hard to find.  It was a really disappointing meal and I couldn't wait to finish eating and leave.

On top of everything that happened, I found the dining experience to be really awkward.  There was no background music. There was mere silence in the restaurant. Dining out at a restaurant is not just about the food; it is also about the experience.  The server who had served us had moved on from playing with his phone to cleaning chopsticks loudly at one of the tables in the dining area.  

I thought that $10 after tax for each of the noodle soups was overpriced based on the fact that the ingredients were so crappy and nonexistent."}
{"text":"I came in here because the newly opened Dagu Rice Noodle was jam packed and my boyfriend wanted to get noodles. This place had 2 other tables already eating when we walked in around 2pm on boxing day. Which seemed really slow compared to what we saw at Dagu but that's probably because Dagu is brand new and there's a hype. Anyways we walked in were greeted and seated immediately.

The menu is really small and limited. We also never had the rice noodle before especially this style where they bring you the raw ingredients and you have to put it into the bowl. I got the concept from all the instagram posts beforehand but didn't know the exact steps on what should go in first. Basically we ticked off on the menu what we wanted gave the sheet to the waiter. 2 seconds later they come out with our raw ingredients. Then we had to wait a bit for the soup, when it did come out the waiters were running it to us and the soup was still bubbling and hot. So I thought ok... I guess we start putting everything in. I put the noodles in first because I didn't know any better then put my ingredients my boyfriend decided to do the reverse. Neither of us really knew what to do... There were no instructions given to us at anytime. 
(only after reading other people's reviews did I learn the \"correct\" way to put the ingredients in-why the hell isn't that written somewhere!?)

The soup was incredibly salty I was dying of thirst afterwards but it was tasty because of the salty. They only gave me 3 slices of meat but a shit ton of noodles. I was definitely full afterwards but I felt like they could have given less noodle and more meat.

 It was a decent place to stop into but it was not amazing.Unless you know what you are doing you may not enjoy it. I'm not too sure if I liked my meal because it was really good or it was damn cold outside and I was HANGRY for warm food."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. I don't think a lot of people know about it because it's not ever really that busy. Its unfortunate another restaurant of similar food opened in the same plaza that is a more well known name. 

Pricing here is very reasonable/cheaper than other places. Its pretty much the same thing. The soup they use here is still very rich and tasty without much MSG, if any at all. I didn't get that nasty mouth feeling after. 

Although they do not have free refills on rice noodles, its more than enough to satisfy. I've been to places with free refills but by the time you're done your soup has already cooled down and you feel too full after. 

Oh, I also always order the squid tentacles to go with the noodles. Very tasty. 

Overall, service here is very quick. It's quiet. It's cheap. And it's tasty!"}
{"text":"Perfect for a cold winter night! Hot, fragrant soup with rice noodles and plenty of toppings. I got the Signature Cross Bridge Rice Noodle and it was my favourite, delicious. We also ordered the fried quail eggs. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"**2.5 stars**

The food is good here, but service is not.  Lady does not speak english, and seems to be in a rush.  

I found a hair in my soup.  Not very appetizing.  Menu is small, mostly noodle soup and appetizers.  Some unique items not found at other places include Pan-Seared Quail Egg, which was nice but I still prefer the non-pan seared version.

Food comes out piping hot so be careful.  Seating and lighting was alright, though a bit loud along with the TV in the background.  It's in the Commerce Gate plaza, so lots of parking."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night.
Ordered:
1.  Tomato-flavoured soup; with noodles
and a set of gimmicky sides, 2 pathetic pieces of hotpot meats, $8.99;
2.  Skewered rib bones (2), $2.99;
3.  Skewered meatball yakitori (2), $2.99;
5.  Pan-seared quail eggs (7), $2.99;
6.  Deep-fried rice balls (6), $2.99;
7.  Fan-tailed shrimps (4), $3.99;
8. Fried chicken wings (4), $2.99 and
9.  2 cans of Coke, $1.50 each.

The best part of this dinner:
2 cold cans of coke!

The noodles and the soup-base were ordinary.  Nothing special about it.

The meatballs were store-bought (No Name meatballs) and skewered, steamed, topped with ketchup!  The nerve of them calling it, \"yakitori.\"

The shrimps were store-bought as well.
The quail eggs were heated in the microwave!
The pork bones were exact:  Pork bones with no flavour, fried, not grilled.
The rice balls were....store-bought, boiled then deep-fried.

Coming to this restaurant felt like going into a fund-raising cook-off ran by children and 
feeling ripped-off afterwards.

It actually felt like a scam of a restaurant!!!
Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"The good: they have authentic rice noodle with a very good portion of meat, vegetables, and other side dishes. Their soup is really good! Of all the Chinese noodles I have tried, this one is definitely one of the top or best that I've had.

The bad: unfortunately only two locations, one in Markham (listed here) and one in Scarborough, both of which are out of way for people taking transit.

The ugly: nothing ugly here.

 Neutral: this place can get pretty packed, even though it just opened. They have a fair amount of seating, but I can see them filling up quite a bit during rush hour dinner times."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for months...fast, fresh, pipping hot! Perfect for a cold winter day or to me...any noodle craving day.

This is their 2nd shop (good job!) 
I like that they stick with their specialties and add on more as they go...one type of noodles, 6-8 broths to choose from. I personally don't eat beef/lamb/or pork and so I asked if they'd just give me enoki mushrooms.  The servers are friendly and willing to help.  I love that they don't just assume that you know the order to insert each ingredient---yes, there is an order to add the quail egg, meats (or in my case vegetables and soy slices) before you add the rest of the dishes down. 

They serve breakfast too!"}
{"text":"The famous hot and spicy soup was hot but spicy. I recommend the tomato soup though. There's side dish you can order for $3.00 but don't expect the portion to be a lot. The beef was too rough. Price was decent and cheaper than what I expected. Service was friendly. No complain  would return again in a cold weather and want something light."}
{"text":"Well foods are okay, service nah... Especially for a waitress.... When I wanted to use a deal with 85 percent discount, she does not really wanted to serve me... That makes me mad."}
{"text":"I had been to A! Xiang's Scarborough location so I know what to expect, maybe with just no expectation?

With all these Yunnan Cross Bridge Noodle Places popping all over GTA, they all just feels similar and familiar. I would not say this is better or worse than others.

Sizzling hot and spicy soup broth did make me happy on a cold and snowy wintery day. 

Staff was fast and efficient. Most of the waitress here speaks Cantonese and Mandarin. 

Probably will be back but not on my regular rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"This place is small but the food taste just great! In addition, their dishes are big, I could not finish.. I recommend rice doodle and cold dishes.
BTW, parking space sometimes is hard to find during the busy hours."}
{"text":"Went late last year. I thought the food was quite good and reasonably priced for what you get. The little trays seem like more of a gimmick than anything, though for picky eaters it assures you that you can avoid any ingredients you don't want. The bowl was very effective in keeping the broth warm throughout the meal and makes a huge difference towards the end of the bowl. Would eat again if I was in the area. For the record I tried the original and spicy broths and both were good. They lost a star because the whole restaurant is very steamy which I didn't appreciate."}
{"text":"One of my favorite rice noodle places. They currently have two locations; one in Scarborough and one in Markham.  I've been to both, the taste is very consistent - I applaud  them for this. 

My go to noodle order is always their spicy soup base. It has just the right amount of spiciness plus numbness ( from the Shichuan peppercorns). 

When you're eating make sure you put everything in from the very beginning, when the pot is still boiling, especially anything that's raw.  The contents of the noodle soup including the noodle is served separately. 

If anyone wants a description of the contents, you can message me XD. 

The actual name of the noodle dish is \"Guo qiao mi xian\".  A direct translation is \" cross bridge rice noodles\". There's a nice history to it, if you want an interesting read, you can google it. 

A must must order is their short rib skewers. Deep fried to perfection, also perfectly seasoned. 

This is my regular spot when I'm having my cravings.
Nothing bad to say about the place. 

Note, if anything is too spicy for you and you want to wash it off, order their soya milk or 'Wang Lao Ji' - a sweet herbal drink."}
{"text":"Very good!!! Very flavourful, fragrant soup that comes in sizzling pots, with springy noodles that don't get soggy. We both got the original and we liked it. 

I put everything in mine and it was delicious - a decent amount of meat, a delightful array of vegetables, an egg, and some kind of fragrant, tasty fermented bean paste that I liked. You can also taste the Chinese ham in the soup - salty and savoury. The portions are quite generous as well. 

Much, much better than their competitor downtown, on Dundas West. I probably wouldn't want to try too many different versions (especially the spicy ones) but I really liked the original and I would absolutely return!"}
