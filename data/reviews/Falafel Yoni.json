{"text":"It's not the Lebanese style falafel sandwich that I'm used to having all the time, although was worth giving it a shot to discover the Israeli version of it. I wasn't impressed much by its overall mild taste but have to say it's still a decent, good quality food. The ingredients inside work well together but lack to deliver a punch or hit than note your taste buds look for. 

The place is quite new, opened up just 2-3 weeks ago if I'm not mistaken. Nice friendly staff, clean and well maintained normal size for falafel joints. Price wise, about $14 tax in without tips. For a falafel pita sandwich with a 12oz cup of lemonade that I believe is prepared with artificial lemon juice, is a bit pricey for me. 

Note: They don't carry straws for the lemonade cup. Excuse me?"}
{"text":"Had the falafel salad,  flavors on point,  perfectly seasoned.  Sort of like a falafel sandwich without the bread. Falafels are really not greasy,  ultra crunchy on the outside, and moist on the inside. Delicious tahini based vinaigrette.  Portion is quite generous.  Had the falafel sandwich at their opening party. I am used to eating Arabic style falafel,  but definitely into the Israeli style. The bread was very fresh and lots of delicious topings. 

Looking forward to trying the othe menu items,  sabich,  zaatar fries etc.. 

The place is spotless and was jammed packed on a random afternoon.  Friendly staff and quick service even though it was busy."}
{"text":"J'étais à l'ouverture du resto et c'était super! Nous avons pu déguster les excellents falafels, assaisonnés comme il faut! Nous avons également goûté l'excellente limonade, et il y avait aussi de la bière.
Falafel Yoni se situe non loin de mon travail, et pas loin des bureaux d'Ubisoft non plus, alors je pense que ça va être un succès et.. ça risque d'être assez plein dès midi en semaine! Prévoyez le coup! :)"}
{"text":"Bite for bite one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Do yourself a favor, order the falafel pita, and immediately order a second one. This place is the TRUTH. The pita bread is to die for. The falafel is perfect. Spice + crunch were juuuust right.  

The only thing possibly better than the food was the service. Staff is friendly, helpful and welcoming. Yoni is a gem of a human being...obviously passionate about his product, an awesome rep of his city, and extraordinarily generous with his time and attention to customers. He spent 15 minutes with us giving us recos to different restaurants + bars throughout the city...the whole experience at Falafel Yoni was an absolute highlight of our trip. We've been back in Chicago for 24 hours and I'm already planning our next visit to Montreal...first stop...Yoni's."}
{"text":"Starving after a long morning of hiking Mont Royal, I already had this place starred on my map. The best falafel I've had in years (maybe ever) and at an excellent price. We were clearly not the only people who had delicious falafel in mind for lunch, as a huge crowd arrived right after we ordered. If you're looking for an excellent and affordable lunch or snack while exploring the Mile End, I highly highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuff!! Great food great atmosphere. Went there for lunch on a weekday and just loved it. The zaatar French frise are a must"}
{"text":"Amazing falafel sandwich Israeli style!!! Really well spiced and dressed. Finally an amazing falafel place in the Mile End which was much needed. Their limonana ( mint lemonade) was extremely fresh and refreshing. 

Staff is super cool and friendly! Come by and try their yummy creations!!!"}
{"text":"Go here. 

I went here a few weeks after opening during Friday lunch hour. There were a solid 15 people in line. It moved quickly!

There are a very few number of things to choose amongst. But honestly, don't question it....just get the falafel sandwich. Fries a decent as well with a nice seasoning, but you will have too much food so I'd recco splitting this. 

Disclaimer, if you're not super starved I would only get a half sandwich. Falafel is something that will hit you like a brick in the stomach, and you'll be full for HOURS. In comparison to a shop like green panther, there are approx 3-4 more falafel balls included. 

Fav thing at Yoni is the La Croix fridge. This buzzy seltzer brand is the BOMB, and really tops off the sandwich. 

Pricing is super reasonable!! You can get a full sandwich and a La Croix for 11$ 

The set up is similar to next door lloydies or green panther, in that you order at the counter and then sit down. Would go here for a quick bite, rather than for a big dinner with friends etc."}
