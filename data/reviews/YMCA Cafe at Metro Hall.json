{"text":"Cheap and delicious jerk chicken lunch on Thursdays. Nothing fancy about this place but you can't beat a big meal for $6.50. Homemade hot sauce is amazing. Jerk is spicy!!"}
{"text":"Pathetic service. Very rude staff, I don't know how but men seemed to have better experience may be because it is that fat lady there who decides everything."}

Participants receive hands-on training in a realistic kitchen environment for 18 weeks under the direction of professional instructors.\"

Excellent initiative!
 I am totally digging greatness of the idea. The service is slow - ok, I can live with that - people are at training after all. Positives: items are very affordable; decent quality; convenient location. 

But. What is up with the customer service?  Based on my colleagues experience and my own the customer service there makes eyebrows rise.  Get your act together, YMCA caf√©.  Other than teaching people how to cook your training program should include paragraphs on how to treat customers, so that they want to use your service again. 
You fail here miserably."}
