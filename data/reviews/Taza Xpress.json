{"text":"One of the best fast food restaurant that offers some Egyptian tasty plates & sandwiches. We enjoyed very reasonable prices, good customer service, and clean place. We live far, but we will re-visit again for sure. It is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Real nice atmosphere. Food is fresh, very tasty and reasonably priced. The owner is pretty cool, was really making sure we gave feedback so he could make the place awesome. Aside from traditional things you'd find in most shawarma spots like on the rocks shawarma, falafel or Shish Taouk they have more obscure but delicious Egyptian items like lentil soup, amazing Kofta, favs beans and koshary. Also Calamari and Philly steak.   I had the mixed grill, for $15 I got a massive kofta, chicken and beef shawarma, and a shish Taouk skewer. Salad and fries on the side. The fries were different than most places, really tasty.   Definitely a place I'll go back to over some other much more expensive places in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very good quality and awesome portion sizes for the money,  good value great service.  Had the large chicken shawarma and Greek salad."}
{"text":"Food is good. Sometimes chicken is kinda rubbery. Not a fan of the owner he's a smuck"}
{"text":":)  taza   means in Arabic fresh to be honest every thing in this restaurant is fresh even the sauces  are fresh and the food  contain all the vitamins and  elements which our body needs. Finally, the concept of taza  is fresh"}
{"text":"I was a little hungry after going to the gym today and decided to look around for food. As I was walking into subway, I noticed Taza Xpress. Never heard of the place before and thought of giving it a shot. It's a nice size place, similar to other shawarma chains. I got the chicken on the rocks. To be honest, I felt that they didn't put enough although the food was very tasty. It was only $6.99 so can't complain. I'd come here again for sure."}
{"text":"Wow!  Had a basic chicken shawarma and it was above and beyond that OTHER shawarma place. (Think nuts!). Husband had a chicken shawarma Neal on fries with salad that was so good. Fries done to perfection. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Newly opened where the old Quiznos was. Food is freshly made and you can actually taste the chicken in the shawarma as its not hidden by loads of sauce like other places.  Rice is fresh and tasty.  Taza has daily specials which have good value or the prices in general are a bit less than competitors. Management and workers are friendly. Been here multiple times already for lunch and will continue to repeat."}
{"text":"If you really want amazing meal with a reasonable price then pick taza..  I recommend the shawerma..  OMG it's one of a kind.  I loved the food a lot"}
{"text":"Great shawarma. Good price and portion. **Beware** of cheese fries that are microwaved  in Styrofoam which is absolutely unsafe. I caught it and they finally end up using a glass plate. The owner was kind enough to give the fires free of charge. Will come back"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem by accident. Try their daily value meal deals if you want to save some bucks. I tried them all and they taste great. The serving portions are decent."}
{"text":"Fantastic -- quality, portion, service, all fantastic. My partner usually gets the chicken on sticks (fav cheat meal), or a plate but he had a shawarma wrap recently and said it was phenomenal. You just can't seem to go wrong here. My order? A side of chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of my favourite shawarma places in Mississauga!   The prices are unbeatable for the amount of food you get, the plates are so big its enough to fill you 2 meals.  I get mine delivered and with Skip the dishes you can get a shawarma plate, extra chicken and garlic fries for just $15.05.  They serve Chicken, Beef, Lamb different kabobs, on rice, or fries with salads (cesear, greek, green!)  They have daily specials and a ton of options, when you walk-in. If you haven't tried this out of highly reccomend it!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite shawarma joint. Their chicken on the rocks is delicious! You have an option of the regular rice or spicy rice which other competitive restaurants don't have.   The taste, portion and price is unbeatable."}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing for shawarmas and their on the rocks but I believe they changed the recipe of their hot sauce and now it tastes like ketchup and its honestly pretty disgusting. For the past few months I've been going back just to see if it will taste like how it used to but that flavour is completely gone and it's been gross every time."}
{"text":"It's the No.1 shawarma place in Mississauga. Every food item is amazing.unlike other places, their meat quality is very good and cooked just perfect..ever since I discovered this place, never eaten this type of food anywhere else.highly recommended"}
{"text":"Happened upon this place by chance I was out with my wife for a motorcycle ride and was starving I pulled over to check what was around and spotted this place, glad I did neat and clean the staff are friendly and professional and are prepared for steady flow of customers ,we had the Sunday special it was delicious the combination of spices and garlic sauces and the mixed salad with olives pickles and fresh beets and the chicken mesh perfectly. Loved it ! I give this place all talons up! Cheers!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma is decent here. The chicken is juicy and not all chicken skin and dried up bits like a lot of shawarma places in the area. The staff is pleasant. This place is better for take out. It almost never has seating available. The drink selection is sparse so don't plan on a drink unless you like a can of coke or water."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and enjoyed both meals.  Falafel was really good and hand made and fried to order.   I usually order tawouk but tried the shawarma and it was good as well. Good amount of toppings and liked the sauce.   Hot sauce could be a bit better. Maybe something harissa based instead of what tastes like Franks red hot. Or maybe I'll just bring my own West Indian pepper sauce next time lol.   Prices were decent and service was good. Will come here now instead of Lazeez as it's closer for me. Definitely better than Osmows which I find overrated."}
{"text":"Hi my name is Ariba and I came into your restaurant today March 14, 2017 around 7:30PM I ordered a half and half which was half fries and half rice on the rock and my sister in law bought a chicken cheese steak. The fries in my half an half was horrible as it was drenched in oil they were so hard it was hard to eat, all I could taste was the disgusting oil. My sister in law had gotten the chicken cheese steak after she paid the lady told her that they were out of buns and that she will wrap it up. That sandwich was honestly disgusting there was so much oil that it was dripping from her sandwich. We both had to throw out our food because of how bad it was! I have been to the Eglinton location and I liked there food a lot! After me and my sister in law went home later at night we both had a really bad stomach ache i don't know if that was after your food or what but i am extremely disappointed with the food and service would never recommend any one here. I am not the type to complain often but this was just disgusting. I would like my money back if the manager or the owner can contact me at 647-818-7883 that would be great!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is average. The prices are reasonable and portions are large.   I ordered the regular size chicken shawarma fries which is big enough for two. And the definitely pack it with lots of chicken. $7.90 including tax  My only problem was the sauces on top. They aren't as rich in flavour as I would of liked. Still worth trying."}
{"text":"A pretty good shawarma! Meat is seasoned well and you get a fair amount (I've noticed that some places cheap out and you get more toppings then meat), you definitely get meat in every bite. The sauces that are used are what make me come back to this place, as well as, the meat is well seasoned. Very flavourful. I've only had the chicken and mixed shawarma sandwiches here, but they have good value daily specials. I'd definitely comeback on various weekdays to try their other food"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch on the recommendation of my friend who said he enjoyed the chicken on the rocks at Taza. When i stepped into the restaurant i noticed the coffee i came in with had water vapour coming off it, the restaurant needs to turn on their heat!   On to the meal i ordered, the chicken on the rocks i ordered with half fries. I ordered it with medium spice but in comparison to other restaurants it is very mild in comparison. The rice is a long grain rice which i found refreshing, the fries are cavendish fries youd find in costco which were crispy and very tasty. Unforunately the amount of chicken that was given was absolutely disappointing in comparison, lazeez and osmows gives more chicken. Also since it was so cold in the restaurant the garlic sauce was very cold and made the rice luke warm.   The silver lining in all of this was that the pricing is very competitive. $6 total for a regular sized on the rocks."}
{"text":"My favourite shawarma place used to be Osmow's in Streetsville.  When this place opened closer to home a while back I didn't expect much.  However, it's cheaper, and now with the improved hot sauce way better than Osmow's.  If you like hot, order it extra hot and you won't be disappointed.  Great flavour and a good nose run ."}
{"text":"This place was good , before. But looks  like  the owners have changed. There is a change in the quantity & quality of the food. My favorite was the Chicken Shawarma plate , ( approx.$14) but now I don't go there so often.  Before it used to be Value For Money for the customers, now it's VFM for the owner & the customer service sucks."}
{"text":"This stuff is pretty good for students, especially the Friday night special. The meat/chicken is a bit poor quality but if you don't care then it's great because you get a lot for cheap. It's clean and has a bunch of TVs to watch games - can't go wrong for a hang out spot"}
{"text":"This is a relatively new Shawarma place that has opened up to replace the Quiznos that was once there.   During my first visit they had a relatively new guy preparing the food hence he didn't put half the sauces that belong on the Chicken on the Rocks dish I had, sadly I realized this when I got home.   I decided to give them another shot and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Compared to my first time, there was definitely something more than just the right sauces being put on. The food does taste somewhat similar to Osmows so if you like Osmows but hate the lines this would be your place as I've never seen them too busy.   The staff are all really friendly, something I feel lacks from other Middle Eastern quick serve places.   P.S if you like your food spicy you might be a little disappointed as their hot sauce isn't all that spicy at all. But they do make up for it by providing you with some Chilli Powder if you so choose."}
{"text":"Delicious shawarma. Had the alexandrian sausage sandwich the first time and it wAs okay. Not a lot of flavour beyond the sausage. Went back the next few days as I was working the in area and has the chicken shawarma wrap both times; probably the best I've had. Tons of flavour, chicken was moist, and there was a hint of curry in the mix.   Line was small each time, prices are excellent, and wait time for your food is ~3 tops. Will definitely go back when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered the regular use shawarma (5.99$) and chicken plate (11.99$).  The food is quite good, although you probably get more value from the sandwich than the plate,  but both are good options, the plate would be more filling.  Only thing that could be better is the wait time for the food.  When I visited, there was another order ahead of mine, and the wait was about 5 minutes...  If I was in Mississauga, and wanted a shawarma, I'd probably come here"}
{"text":"food is very fresh, and i really enjoyed my meal.  The staff Saif was so patient with trying to help me figure out how I wanted my meal, as Im on a low cal diet. The cost to eat is so reasonable that I decided to have dinner the following night from taza again. Im giving it 4 star because they need some take out menus to look at ,because the menu board is hard for me to read lol. Thanks for 2 great meals , and see you soon.  From a Local resident"}
{"text":"Been there many time. I usually order over the phone and pick up. Customer service is great. Food quality has dropped recently. I would still order there. Could increase the portion of meat and use less oil."}
{"text":"If you're craving shawarma + salt, this is the place for you!  I find most shawarma places high in sodium, so I know what to expect.  The \"Xpress\" was pretty accurate.  It took a few minutes to throw together my Chicken On-The-Rocks ($7.99):  a bed of seasoned rice, seasoned chicken shawarma, and 3 sauces - white, red, & I think there was a tahini.  Some salad/veg would've balanced it out nicely!  Order said \"mild\", but it was actually medium-spicy.   Sauces and spices did taste better than other places.  Other than a bit too much salt, I liked the marinate on the chicken.  Chicken wasn't dried out like many shawarma places.  All in all, it was tasty, approx. 3-4 normal portions, but again, on the salty side.  I requested \"not as much\" sauce and it was still pretty saucy, as per photo.  If this bothers you, maybe just reiterate.  Lady who took my order was sweet.  Quick and no nonsense for takeout.  Restaurant was 75% full.  Convenient location, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I love this place for shawarmas and chicken on the rocks! Amazing daily deals and affordable prices !"}
{"text":"This place is kinda meh. The chicken on the rocks is ok. Not something i would go back for. The rice was pretty bland. And the garlic sauce was just sauce. No real flavour.  We also tried the garlic fries. Also meh. I was not a fan of the sauce. So overall I would say skip this one and take the short drive over to osmows for a way tastier experience."}
{"text":"Halal Middle Eastern.   Ordered food from here. Firstly, whenever you call, the background noise is so bad that you can barely understand the person on the phone. Secondly, do not go by their flyer. They choose to change their specials as they please. I called to order the special for that day and the guy told me he changed it and it was something totally different. I don't understand why a restaurant would do something like that? This place just opened and I picked up their flyer a week after they opened. Why even have a menu printed and not stick to it?   On to the food. The chicken on the rocks was good. The rice are not the traditional middle Eastern rice pilaf...they are the basmati rice. So that was alright. Their Philly steak was good. Again, they ran out of buns so he had to wrap it up instead. Again, how can you run a restaurant like this? You advertise but then change it up.  They might as well tell you what you will eat rather than you asking for something specific. That's the way this place is. Good luck my fellow yelper if you happen to go here or think about it.   Yelp on! May the yelp be with you if you visit here."}
{"text":"First time trying Taza! It was hyped up by a few of my friends and recommended to try the chicken on the sticks because the fries are like Costco fries. THEYRE LIKE COSTCO FRIES!! And they have bomb fries. I wasn't able to go to the store to order but my friends ordered for me and we had it all to go. It comes in 3 sizes. Student size, regular and large.  Student is a perfect size for me but I got a regular which was HUGE. It was in one of those square boxes (a large in lazeez to compare) and it was filled with a good amount. A Taza size large is in the same box except it's stacked up a little higher. I compared a R and a L and there's a huge difference. They don't charge extra for getting half & half (fries and fries). I did that to try it out.  I'm not a fan of the rice, I find lazeez and osmows has better rice but the fries here are the best. The other two places can't compare! The chicken and sauce is just about the same.  Would come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Friday special: two chicken on the rocks for $10. Pros: meat is well seasoned, price is very good. Cons: we ordered \"hot\" but the hot sauce/ red sauce was very mild, it was a bit sweet. It almost tasted like ketchup mixed with hot sauce. I wasn't a fan of their regular sauce either in comparison to other places.  The serving portion was smaller than other places, but acceptable for the Friday special deal. The service was pretty bad and rude.  We also ordered the falafel appetizer, it was nothing to brag about.   With chicken on the rocks, it's the sauce that can make or break the dish in my opinion. And this one was a flop.  I'd maybe be back to try a shawarma sandwich or something since the meat was good."}
