{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. The food is delicious, and the staff is friendly. Food is quick to leave the kitchen. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Decided to give Glory of India a chance tonight for the first time. Never thought I would go there for Valentines day dinner, but was a very good choice. Agree with a lot of the other reviews when they say it's a little pricey but the food was great. My wife had the butter chicken and I had the chicken tikka masala. Appetizer platter was tasty and had a good bite. Will definitely go again,hopefully for the lunch buffet during the week."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Food is a little on the pricier side, but very good quality - not overly salty or sweet. Can't comment on the quality of the lunch buffet, but dinner a-la-carte was excellent. Definitely will be our go-to Indian restaurant in Calgary!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my work and my co-workers and I frequently do their take-out buffet for lunch. We go so often that i would consider us to be regulars. All of us get rice, butter chicken and naan on our visit, and sometimes, a few other things (their pokora is usually really good). The food is great, however after todays experience, i'm not sure if I will be going back. A co-worker of mine could not make the trek up the street today on lunch, so i offered to bring it back for her along with my food. She only felt like having the chicken. I paid for our take out contatiners and as I was filling them up, one of the waiters (maybe the owner) comes over and YELLS at me telling me i was not allowed to just have chicken (my take out containers had other items in it). I tried to explain to him that this order was for a friend, but he would not listen and continued to speak to me rudely. There must have been 10 other people in the buffet line who watched this man yell at me and tell me over and over again i wasn't allowed to have just chicken. This is a BUFFET. No where does it say that I cannot eat just the things i like, nowhere does it say that i have to eat every item on display. I was not impressed by his treatment of me, and very upset that he embarassed me in front of several customers. I asked for my money back for container he took away from me. He did give me back my money, THEN took the chicken I had put into the container BACK into the buffet!!!! Its too bad that this happened as he just lost a regular customer. sigh... i really liked their food too!"}
{"text":"(January 2014) I'm new to city, so I went here with a group of colleagues for a Friday lunch. Goal every week is to find a place under $20. Buffet Price: $17.95. Overall: Average, as nothing stood out. Pros: Prompt service, friendly staff, pretty decent spread of food! Cons: Dried out chicken, nothing too hot or flavorful. Butter Chicken probably had the best flavor, and the Naan is good! Also to note - it was quite busy during the lunch hour...so take my review for what it's worth for a buffet."}
{"text":"We went here lured by its name Glory, but its probably the worst Indian restaurant we ever been. Bad customer service and the price is not worth paying at all. The meat tastes like a few days old and cheap basmathi rice were used for the menu. You better off having beriyani next door"}
{"text":"Good place great value. Enjoyed whole meal with kingfisher beer. The only think is no matter when you go always same dishes! Of 9 out of 10 the same. Sometimes the put samosas and popadums on not all the time.   Still good food"}
{"text":"I had a Dealfind voucher for Glory of India (Sunridge) that I used a few weeks ago.  Overall, I was satisfied with the food we received, especially relative to the Dealfind price.  It's nice to find restaurants with lunch buffets on the weekend, as my work schedule doesn't allow me to go out for lunch during the week.  The Glory of India lunch buffet featured a fairly good selection of foods, including lots of salads, a few rice dishes, about four different vegetarian curries, a few meat dishes, pakoras, naan and desserts.  As a vegetarian I felt that I had sufficient choice, and my meat-eating friends were happy as well.  On our first trip to the buffet a number of dishes looked quite full, yet were only lukewarm when we got them to our table, but when we went back for second servings a number of dishes had been swapped out and replaced with something different, and all the new food was piping hot.  Eat slowly at Glory of India and you'll probably get to try lots of new things each time you go back for more!    While we were there one of the Dealfind \"cooking classes\" was going on, and I was glad I hadn't bought one of those vouchers (I'd considered it).  It was very much a demonstration, with most people not having a chance to do anything hands-on, and the instructor didn't seem very skilled at teaching cooking.  He might have been great at preparing the food, but his delivery of the information was awkward and at times unclear.    Random comment: Why are there two COMPLETELY DIFFERENT drinks called \"Glorious Monkey\" on the menu?  Could they not think of ANY other names?"}
{"text":"I've been to the Downtown location a couple of times and thought I would check this out. Particularly as they had signs outside for Lunch Buffet $12.99 & Dinner Buffet for $14.99 which seemed a decent price. Sadly, realized after dinner, that they had jacked up the price for each by $2. Which honestly makes it unnecessarily expensive for the NE, there are much better Indian restaurants and you can pay less.  The place was in disarray, tables without chairs and the table we were first sat down on had rather uncomfy chairs (they kind of wobbled & I'm a normal-sized person). So I asked to move to the booth and the guy just mumbled something like over in the back & something about tables being blocked (made no sense).  The dishes weren't very clean, which really bothered me. I went through the plates to pick out cleaner ones. One plate actually had foot left on it - blech!  The buffet food was alright, your standard fair with a few random things like noodles & chicken wings (like wtf?). Chick peas were too spicy & I like spicy food. Butter chicken was pretty good though.  The worst was dessert, I had a little bit of everything off the table and it was all gross except for the fruit. Personally, I love Indian sweets & was excited for the kheer, galub jamuns, and rasgoollas. They all turned out to taste horrible, the kheer & galub jamuns made me just want to spit them out.  All in all, totally not worth going again. I don't recommend it. Plus random note, I didn't see a single female worker, like what's up with that?"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful time here. We weren't quite sure what to expect because of the low star rating, but we were so pleasantly surprised by the delicious flavours! Yummy!! We shared the meat sampler and veggie sampler dishes. They both came with three savoury dishes, piping hot, heavenly nan bread, a small salad, an appetizer and rice pudding. I was stuffed before I finished half!  We will be back! Do your mouth a favour and go here"}
{"text":"I got the lunch takeout - it was about $15 for the container. Food by weight is usually a little pricey and that was fine, but I was disappointed in the quality for the price. I would not return for lunch, and for the price I don't think I'd return for a full buffet meal either."}
{"text":"Phall the Conqueror  Before you read this review, google Phall curry if you have not heard of it...  I have been to Glory of India 3 or 4 times for dinner, and numerous times for lunch as it's close to work. It's pretty good. It probably warrants 3 stars for its lunch buffet, but I am giving 4 thanks to a most memorable dining experience one night last year where we special-ordered Phall curry.   Phall curry is the world's hottest curry, and very few restaurants will serve it. So, kudos to Glory of India for indulging us. The experience was documented by a food reviewer in FFWD magazine, who shared the Phall with us that night. The link to the article is here, hope I can post it in this review:  http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/food/phall-the-conqueror-9524/  It is a far better review than I could ever write.  From a service point of view, I have nothing but good things to say about this place, friendly and good service and they specially-prepared this dish for us. They took great care of us, and even gave everyone a small bottle of their very own Glory of India hot sauce as a souvenir. They sell it by the bottle, and believe me, it holds its own with the crazy-hot boutique sauces that are out there these days...  So, absolutely I'll go back. I might even try the Phall again. Dare ya!"}
{"text":"Wanted to find a good Indian buffet in downtown Calgary.  The lunch buffet was $17 and their selection wasn't the best.  The buffet is overpriced for the quality and the selection available."}
{"text":"I stopped by for a quick lunch pick-up and I didn't expect much after reading their reviews but the food was definitely worth trying. I'd probably go back for the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"So the Cheesecake cafe somehow went under and a wicked Indian buffet took over the locale. Right in the parking lot of Sunridge Mall, visible from 36 St NE, it's got a great location. Free parking. Upon entering the place was packed, didn't take long to get a table and then you go right to the buffet. It's all indian fare, no fries or pizza or pasta. Basmati steamed rice, lamb curry, different salads, a nice tasty tandoori chicken and a great tasting butter chicken are available. Buffet is a great way to try a bunch of different types of food you wouldn't otherwise check out. I went for the Fish Pakora and found it very tasty. Also you can go nuts on the Naan bread, who's gonna judge?  The dessert table is a bit small, almost seems like an afterthought. Couple of indian desserts with no visible labels, an assorted fruit plate and some carrot cake and nanaimo bars. If you're not allergic to anything, grab a spoonful and spin the wheel, you'll be pleasantly surprised.. or not. In any case, it's good to try new things."}
{"text":"absolute garbage!! or should i say trash? their food does not live up to any expectations on the 'indian food scale' QUITE bland and when i complained about the service i met with some person named jesse who apparently is the owner and boy, was he horrid. no customer service skills whatsoever, i will NEVER step foot in this place again!!  watch out for this one fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Got a vindaloo chicken, beef samosas, naan and rice. Samosas were made with prefabricated sheet pastry dough.  The chicken was loaded with chili peppers but otherwise lacked taste completely, and tasted more Mexican than Indian."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems to always have mixed reviews, it has days where it's excellent and a lot of days where it's sub-par for an Indian restaurant. Like most people who visit this establishment we went there because it is sort of in the middle to all of us working in the core.  I like lunch buffets because then I have a choice as to what I want to eat. I'm a big \"see the food, eat the food\" kind of person, I'm not a foodie, I don't know what most menu items are if I read it but if I can see it I know what I like.  I truly do love Tandoori Chicken but however everywhere I eat Tandoori Chicken the Chicken itself seems so...dry? I honestly don't know if this is normal or not and I'm in no way judging - simply I just find it is too dry for my tastes.  The rice here is delicious especially when you put on some of that great sauce and vegetables they usually have in one of the buffet bowl tray things. I especially love, love, love butter chicken and basically fill most of my plate with that. Combined with some naan bread we have ourselves a eat-lunch-then-fall-asleep scenario.  My only gripe with this restaurant is that I think it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"As many other reviews have pointed out, this is not the best Indian food in Calgary. In fact, I was told it was East Indian food. If that is true, it still isn't that good.  The place is clean and reasonably easy to find; parking is not a problem in the evening as it is free after 6pm in downtown Calgary.  If only I would have bothered to read the reviews instead of going an acquaintances recommendation of this restaurant, I could have save myself nearly $40.  Before going further, you can get much better Indian food at the Taj Mahal on MacLeod (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/taj-mahal-restaurant-calgary) for about 1/2 the price and 25% more food per serving. Add to that, it tastes way fresher and they run a buffet on Tuesday/Wednesdays.  The waitress seemed truly disinterested but not quite rude. The older gentleman that others have referred to was there and seemed reasonably nice.  We each got the meat platter which is basically a metal lunch tray with some lamb, beef, and chicken and associated curries. Has a small salad as an appetizer and rice pudding as dessert. This was $24.95 and the portions were small but the reasoning was that a sampler to see what's good here. Apparently, logic failed me. Add to that, I paid $8 or $9 for Long Island Ice Tea such that I could have a beer to Nestea and it would have tasted stronger and not to mention better. It took them 11 seconds to make that drink. A 4-shot drink, mixer, and garnish takes more than 11 seconds to make (if you are making it right).  Sticking to this price range if you must, go to Namskar (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/namskar-calgary).  There is no Glory in being honest and there is definitely no Glory here and apparently, no Indian food either."}
{"text":"Went here for the Indian buffet. Let's get one thing straight, Indian food is generally not cheap and the market is very competitive. So you have to be a little picky when it comes to your butter chicken!  For $17, I found the buffet selection not only very lacking, but of questionable quality. It was probably the worst butter chicken I've had (think more tomato sauce than butter). The tandoori lacked punch, and there were no Dals to choose from. They couldn't keep the naan bread stocked either. The salads were virtually identical and took up nearly a third of the buffet space.  I can't recommend it, and would instead try elsewhere. If you're really hungry, you can probably get your $17 worth. But generally I think it's a waste of time due to the low quality."}
{"text":"I give 3 stars for food, service and the place. All the items on the menu were priced little high.   Few things were really good. Garlic naan, Fish masala( my fave dish here), panneer tikka (appetizer), chicken tikka masala.  Never try chicken biryani here. It was not worth the taste and price. I had been here around 4 times. But during my last visit the annoying thing was the waitor was trying to make us order some dishes which we were not interested to and two in place of one. Of course we did try one of his choices which was worst in taste. And a lot food was wasted just because of following his suggestions.Better select your own dishes.   Always remember to insist for gravy if you need some with the curries. Mostly they give very less gravy with curries.  No dinner buffets here. I am yet to try lunch buffet here. Update you on that soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fine service in the evening. The staff are happy to explain dishes and make suggestions. The lunch buffet is varied and excellent.   I would recommend this restaurant for both the lunch buffet and the evening a la carte menus."}
{"text":"Glory of India had an excellent lunch buffet at the NE location.  I also found the service very good.  We happened to catch the Naan piping hot out of the tandoori oven.  The butter chicken was great as was the Pakoras .  I would come back as would the 2 others I was with ."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten at this restaurant. I guess after the first time I thought the second time it would be better but I was certainly wrong!  I had one of those dealfind coupons. I guess that turned off the owner from the get go, I should've known.  He was very rude once he found out I had a coupon, it was almost as though he was doing us a favor.  We ordered the food for pick up. They didn't even offer us a place to sit and wait, so we basically waited outside. Once we got home and ate the food it was even more disappointment. We ordered the eggplant curry which was so SOUR!!! It  went in the trash. The lamb curry had a terrible smell as well, almost as though the lamb was not cooked or seasoned right, that went in the trash too.  The mango lassi was a joke. The naan was descent. Honestly, although I had a coupon we ended up spending an additional $30-40 dollars. I felt as though I should have just given my money to the random guy walking on the street.  After eating food from this restaurant I would strongly recommend NOT to eat here. Save your money, go somewhere where the quality and service are better. If I had the option to give this restaurant a zero I would."}
{"text":"Pathetic place for any kind of food. Food is oily, plates are dirty, hostess are angry. Cook doesnt know how to cook food well.  I tried samosas and they were dripping oil. I tried tandoori chicken and they were burnt. Its better if you go to nearby MangoShiva or Maharaja. They are better in almost same money."}
{"text":"There were 2 tables and 2 waiters...and yet the service was horrible.  This can be overlooked if the food is good, but unfortunately it was not.  I have never had flavorless Indian food before, but I did tonight....  This was an all around bad experience..."}
{"text":"Very expensive for what you get, portions small, scant meat in main dishes that average $18 to $23.  Taste of food was fine.  Owner/manager was quite rude.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of coworkers for dinner. We got a quite few different dishes and shared them all family style.   They serve stuffed naan, which was overly greasy... not very naan-like at all.  The entrees were not as flavorful and spicy as I have come to expect Indian food to be. I like my vindaloo with a serious kick to it, and it just wasn't impressive at all.  I'd imagine it's like London's Indian cuisine... I've never been to London, but I hear the food there is generally not that great, and that's just how I felt about this place.   Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Hey they are bad bad .........  There r two ladies they just know how to dress up.guys whenever u go for dinner,going for entertain,relaxation.but they give headache to me & my husband..they gave us uncooked food .&too bad service.when we got our butter chicken ,waiting for Indian bread..I  called the waiter 5 times just for the water. U know the chef should taste himself first,then serve it in front of others.chef, waiter,owner......everybody contributes something in your service.                     Glory of India people dt spoil our Indian image.I don't want to put bad review but u r sitting in downtown .so common be serious there r so many options to eat.not only you.at least learn first how to smile .u r nt stuffing our stomach .u have to give great environment..."}
{"text":"Our group came here for the lunch buffet.  Not the greatest Indian food.  I've had better.  The tapioca pearl dessert put me off.  Tasted like rubber."}
{"text":"Solid 2.5 stars.  It's true there is better Indian out there, ie Royal India, but you can't go wrong if you're in the craving for Indian food in this area.  Packed today lunch, so that's a good sign to me: high turnover of food.  Tried their butter chicken, eggplant, and I can't remember the yellow one...actually, the rice was nice and fluffy.  It's a cramped location, though I think the right side has a bit more room.  And when you have the buffet as an option, not surprised.    Decor-wise, it's not as elegant."}
{"text":"This is the one of the worst restaurant I have ever been.. rude behaviour.. ery Expensive food with very small portion. Taste is bad. Service is poor. I would not return"}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is delicious. You're a little squished in there but the food more than makes up for it. Large selection of piping hot dishes"}
{"text":"Absolutely deplorable service. Disrespectful and rude. Don't eat here. We bought two groupons, one per couple, we were a group of four, paying in two separate bills. Fair, the groupons says one per table. Not disputing that fact. We politely asked if we could use them both as we were two couples paying separately. The gentleman went to ask. We are fine up till here. The first gentleman comes back and says no, we cannot as we need to use one per table. So we asked to be moved from a booth to two tables together so we could use them and still visit with our friends. I don't feel we are unreasonable at all up to this point... He says they are booked up, we can split up, one group on one side of the restaurant and the other on the complete other side. He was just doing this to be a complete douche. No reason... Just because he is a miserable human being with nothing better to do with his life. Also, side note, walked by later, and the place is dead, like no one there. So while we didn't try the food, maybe that says something. That or horrific service is common place! We say that seems unfair. We can go to separate tables and use them, and take up a table that someone else can use, or we can just use them both here..... Please, tell me where their logic is? How would they lose? So the owner or manager comes over, a disgusting person. RUDE! From the get go. He starts off saying we are trying to get free food from them.... Sir, we bought your groupon, which if you don't want to give people a deal, please tell me why you did a groupon... Oh, I know, you're DEAD every night. No one wants to eat there!!!! So it makes no sense why you would give people such a horrible experience. He started saying that we are trying to get food for free. Yelling for no reason in his empty restaurant. I told him to calm down and stop yelling at my husband for no reason. He kept going. \"You are cheap. Trying to get good for free\"..... I don't know how he assumes that, especially since their prices would dictate that we would have to spend more money than his $40 groupon anyways so he really only had money to make. And I'm sorry, but you insult me by calling me cheap. You won't let people use two groupons together. And if it had been put to us in a kind and respectful manner, fine, but trying to get free food and yelling out of nowhere.... Disgusting. Sir, I am a business woman. My husband also works downtown. It is not as if we are degenerates coming in off the street looking like we cannot pay. Your disrespect displays more about your poor character than anything. I am sorry for you and the pathetic life you lead. You probably desperately needed our business. And even as we were walking out he continued to yell at us, a calm group of people, that he is not a food bank... If you're struggling with money and business, I get it is hard, but don't take it out on people. I apologize, but with so many amazing local businesses in Calgary, I hope your business fails and the ones that treat people with respect get the business that they deserve, because you deserve none of it. Respect. Learn it. Live it. And maybe you would actually have had people in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Really I think I would have given this place 3.5 stars if I could. I have been wanting to try this place, but I was deterred by the fact that so many reviewers commented on the high prices. So, when I saw that there was a Groupon, I quickly snatched it up.   Now, I haven't had much Indian in Calgary, but I have spent considerable time in Southern Asia and I make it a point to have North/South Indian or Sri Lankan food whenever I can. So, please note that my review is based on my general experiences - this might be stellar considering the other options in Calgary; I just don't know yet.   Ok, so caveats aside - the Glory of India is a solid example Indian food. There is a comprehensive menu (to include vegetarian dishes) and a nice diversity of styles (it's not all butter chicken and garlic naan.) However, the flavor could have been more robust and complex. The pakora, for instance, were quite tasty but I feel like they might have been half regular flour and half chick pea flour because I just didn't feel the chick pea taste. Anyway, this isn't to say that the place is bad - quite the contrary, the food is delicious. It's just if you're looking for super authentic Indian food, you'll come up a bit disappointed.   However, if you're looking for a good dinner that can satisfy meat eaters and vegetarians or if you're looking for something new to try, Glory of India is your place. I would say, though, that the prices are kind of steep, so buyer beware."}
{"text":"Now, I've been here maybe twice over the years, and both time I've found the food to be more or less ok.  I've had the buffet, ordered from the menu, and really can't say too much except that it's reasonably edible and the butter chicken has the usual flavours (though not exactly mind blowing).  The tandoori was a little bit too overcooked (oddly both when a la carte and buffet), the naan bread was steamed horrifically to stay warm, and the vindaloo items were not spicy in the slightest.   To be fair though, the samosas rocked. and I also enjoyed the goat curries with the stewed spinach.  The decor is a bit dated, and really guys, are you trying to save money on electricity?  2 trips there, and it was always almost like dining in the dark.    As for anything else I might have to say about the place.  Well, I have a tale to tell about the lack of professional courtesy and how they really po'ed me once, and an aunt of mine as well.    Once, as a surprise thing for my gal, I had picked up a whole bunch of deals for teaching lessons for a class (something like 20+) after I had talked to the owner himself about how I'd like to have a group thing.  When he found out how many I intended to pick up, he seemed pretty pleased, but told me to book the date at the end of the month since the event was in the middle of the following month.    Sooo... doing as he told me, I did exactly that.... only to be told at the end of the month that he had suddenly decided some time during the previous month to open up the reservation book and filled up all the dates.  By the time I called at the exact time I was told to book, I found out that the entire month was booked solid and that I could book only over a month AFTER the intended time.  Remember, deal or not, I still spent something like over $1000 or an entire class on my own, and he just threw me under the bus without even the courtesy of telling me.  When I found this out, I had to scramble for another venue and luckily, was able to get a refund on most of the lesson vouchers.  It ended up costing me a LOT more, but in the end, it was still worth it.  Funny thing, the day before the originally planned event (ended up sending my gal and her friends to Banff), they resto had the gall to call me and say that they suddenly have space for the class, and want to book me asap.  I basically replied politely on how they ruined my plans, got my money refunded after a bit of a fight, and quietly hung up.    So, will I ever go back there again?  Myself, probably not, but if you're looking for a 1/2 decent indian buffet, it's not a bad place to be.  I'd probably go to Royal India instead personally though if huge amounts of indian food is wanted, or Namskar for excellent a la carte."}
{"text":"Thr buffet for lunch is ok.. They have a good variety. And all I tried was good. My favorite was the salad with mango and tamarindo dressing .. Even when this is not the best Indian food I have tried I think is a good option if you want to try something different and you are around and in a rush... The service was good.. Not great, but good enough..."}
{"text":"We are very new to the town and were looking for a nice Indian restaurant, although we are not originally Indians but we like it. It was very cold so we jumped into the first one we came across which was glory of India.  Basically it's rubbish and can't be even as good as some inidian fast foods. We were very hungry and any acceptable dish would have tasted just wonderful. However even with this fact we left all dishes half full. We ordered butter chicken, which was just acceptable, nothing wrong with the nan bread, the beryani's were very bad. We tried both prawn and chicken beryani's. We even asked fir yoghurt which is something complementary with any beryani's dish in the world and it cost us $3+. The other specialty of most of Indian kitchens is mango Lacy juice, which was also not to the standard but it was drinkable.  Prices are very high for what we eat. Ambiance is very old. We were the only occupied table. Will never waste my time again there. DO NOT GO THERE."}
{"text":"Glory of India was a big let down.  I decided to try the butter chicken and some garlic naan.  The chicken in the butter chicken was extremely over cooked, making it dry and almost inedible.  On the other hand the naan was undercooked!  It was very doughy and was not quite bread yet.  I definitely will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Very pricey for the portions. The food itself is good, but not a ton of bang for your buck! I think it's a nice pitstop if you're not in a hurry and feel like indian!"}
{"text":"I would have given it a solid 4 stars if it weren't for the massive hoards of flies everywhere. Every part of the wall had flies. Really makes you wonder how the kitchen would be considering this sanitation concern."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!! Only had the table for 30 minutes and the manager told my party we had to leave even though we were not finished. When I spoke about being there only 30 minutes the guy told me not to ever come back. No problem there! I have never been treated so rudely in any establishment. The manager should be very ashamed to run a business that way."}
{"text":"Haha... judging by the reviews my theory holds true - People are picky on their Indian food.  ...myself included.  Well, here's my two cents on Glory (and I have tried at least 10 places in Calgary). I quite like Glory. In the last seven years I have been many, many times. Some for Bday parties and others just for a quick supper with a friend. It has rarely to never disappointed me or my friends when we have come by to overeat and roll home.   The service seems to be on par most times (not exceptional by better than some). The food comes in a decent amount of time regardless of how busy they are, and the servers are attentive to drinks, etc. I have eaten quite a number of things off the menu but the Butter Chicken brings me to a special place like no other BC's have at other places. It's really, really good. I have gone at times and eaten just this (which seems like a sin really). Other staples and favs are the gosht Korma, chicken Aftaab and Malai Kofta (delicious tender little dumplings in sauce). The Gulab Jamun for dessert is a sinful weakness that is a must have. I skip rice as its tasteless filler but overdue it on garlic naan to sop up every drop of sauce (embarrassingly). I really like their naan for making BC sandwiches as well.  For Indian - Glory remains my fav and likely will stay that way. The prices are a little high for what you get, but again when I go - I overeat until I start to sweat so I try to not go too often. Bad idea."}
