{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  We found it by accident.  It was raining and we had gone to a shop nearby and decided to have dinner here.  The place is located in a \"blah\" shopping center.  You open the door and expect to see a run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet with crap food.  To our delight, it was a sit-down and get a waitress type restaurant!  We order the appetizer platter for two, which came with a flaming grill.  It was really tasty - but pretty average - possibly slightly better than average.  Now the food we order was pretty awesome.  The General Tso's Chicken was the most impressive as it wasn't all coated in 4 pounds of greasy batter.  It was chicken breast cut into large chunks with WONDERFUL sauce on it -- not that gross jelly-like substance many of the buffets use.  SOOOOOOOOOOOO Tasty!  If you go there - you have to have it!  We will definteily be going back to this restaurant.  AS for the atmosphere -- it was pretty nice.  If they lost those tacky red Chinese Horoscope place mats and went with plain white ones.......their decor would be way above average for a Chinese place.  I'd say that was my only complaint.  The placemats cheapened the place.  Other than that --- EAT THERE at least once!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites. Going here for years. Great won-ton soup, chan's fried rice is very good, and the egg rolls are a great snack, and affordable. The chop suey could have more meat. General tso's not spicy enough.
Nice owners with prompt and clean service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's probably going to be a favorite of mine. It's very easy to get to by public transportation (you can just ride on the 13 or 8 up to the plaza) and it's nice and relaxing. The staff are nice and the food is great."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today with my partner for lunch. We reside in Brighton Heights and were not aware of this restaurant, until friends told is that they love it.
First thing we noticed was how exceptionally clean it was. We also were amazed at how friendly the staff was.

Food was very tasty: We ordered steamed potstickers for an appetizer. They tasted really good, my partner loved the sauce that came with them. 

I had Kung Pao Chicken: I was thrilled that it came with grilled white meat chicken. I cleaned my plate, so it must have been good.

My partner had peppered steak and he said that it was really good. 

We noticed that they had a steady stream of take out orders come in while we were eating. They seemed to know everyone by name which was a nice touch. Everyone loves to be personalized and recognized..."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst Chinese restaurants I've been to.  Low mein was saucy and had a peculiar yellow tint, as did our fried rice. General Tso's sauce was off and tasted faintly of BBQ sauce.  Low mein was delivered by waitress with the greeting \"here's your Chinese spaghetti.\"  Food was fast was one positive."}
{"text":"I found the place by accident, and stopped in to get the standard fried rice.  I have been back four times since, have gotten the shrimp fried rice every time, and some other generic chinese food item.

I really really like the place.  It is not your average store front Chinese place that has a few chairs and ratty tables, the screaming child in a crib behind the counter, and greasy horrible food that makes you wonder why you keep trying to get food at Chinese places in plazas.   You know the place.  They all have that same two sided color menu on a shiny sheet of paper, all the same items, and it all greasy and terrible.

This place is an actual sit down restaurant.  It is NOT dark and / or dingy like the other review states, must be talking about some other Chan's Tea House...  Anyways, it is also not the kind of Chinese food you will find in say, San Francisco or L.A. or New York.  It is very typically mid-western Chinese.  It looks like something from the 1950's or 60's.  Very retro looking.

And the food is excellent.  To me.  Now, I have eaten Chinese food that I assume folks are writing about when they say \"real\" Chinese food.  Since I have been in China.  This is not it.  You cannot get steamed jellyfish and pigs ears here.  

What you do get, is very well prepared food, that tastes like what you got when you were a kid, and went to your favorite Chinese restaurant with your family.  It is always busy for dinner, a good sign, and the food comes out quickly, and very hot.

And, for me the most important thing, the hot mustard is house hot mustard that will lift off the top of your head.  I love the stuff.  Exquisitely hot!

And, the food is not greasy by American Chinese food standards.  And, I love the fried rice.  It is well seasoned, has plenty of meat, and has bean sprouts in it.  Eat here, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't want something like ox-knuckle soup or pig intestines in broth.  

Then again, who knows?  I have been to a few Chinese places that hide the \"real\" food from the round-eyes, you have to know how to ask for it.  Maybe I will try that next..."}
{"text":"This is my ultimate favorite Chinese food restaurant. Their vegetable fried rice is my favorite anywhere located in the whole Pittsburgh area. Ever since I had theirs, I don't even like to get it anywhere else. Their General Tso's Chicken is also very delicious and even though I'm not ever the one to order it, when someone else does, I always happen to \"accidentally\" eat half of the container. This place has always gotten my order accurately and on time."}
{"text":"Nice decor and interior. Friendly waitress.
Food was mediocre.
Egg roll flavorless.
Fried rice was room temp. Gen Tso's was lacking in flavor. And not spicy/hot. 
No mas!"}
{"text":"I treated my sister to dinner there last night and we both had the Thursday special - chicken/shrimp combo. It was excellent. Very tasty sauce with wine in. Our waitress, Anita, was pleasant with a sense of humor! We both plan to return!"}
{"text":"Excruciatingly slow service, all of the meals were overcooked and bland, and the meals were all served at different times. My daughter just received her meal, 15 minutes after the first meal was served. Perhaps it's an off night or the new ownership, but we will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chan's since I was a kid and I never get tired of it!  The food is amazing.  I've lived and traveled around the world and I can honestly say that I'm yet to find a Chinese restaurant that can compare to Chan's Tea House.  I love the General Tso's chicken and won ton soup.....every time I'm back in the PGH region I stop in for lunch and/or dinner....enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really good  limited menu Chinese. They concentrate on dishes/sauces they have perfected unlike some Chinese places that list two pages of Chef's Specials (aka expensive usually) and another four pages of staples like General Tso's chix. We noticed a lot of folks eating the \"pu pu platter\" including sterno for roasting what looked like pork ribs. Light white sauce on scallops/shrimp is delicate. 

Great service. Nice atmosphere. Cocktails/beer available. Bathroom was very neat and clean."}
{"text":"My being going to Chan's for many years now.  I love good Chinese food and Chan's is \"Top Shelf\"!  The service is impeccable and the establishment is always clean.  I, usually order either the Chicken Fried Rice or the Moo Goo Gai-Pan.  The portions are large and delicious.  John, the owner usually always greets new and returning customers as they enter the restaurant, which really makes me feel good.

Try it, you will like it!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I drove from Hampton Township to West View for dinner on Sunday night. We had a wonderful experience and the food was great! My grandmother used to take us here when we were kids and everything is as good as I remember. 

My father really wanted a dish that he used to get back in the 80s/90s that is no longer on the menu. While he ordered something different, we did ask about it after we were finished eating. Our server chuckled a bit and said that we must have been coming to the restaurant for a while. They they could definitely still make it for us next time, we just have to ask. 

I've truly never had a bad meal at Chan's. I know it's \"American\" Chinese, but I vastly prefer this restaurant over all of my local take out places."}
{"text":"Good food.  Besides regular menu, they have some new items and fruit drinks and smoothies now , as well wine and beer."}
{"text":"This is the second closest Chinese food resturant to my house.  With that being said I am crushed to report that it stinks here.  The decor is out dated and dark, not very welcolming for lunch.  The attitude of the wait staff and owners is poor, they lack any interest in running a resturant that serves good food. 

The food is served luke warm. The hot and sour soup is stringy and cold .

The food is flavorless.  There are serveral senior communities around this shopping center , so possbily they're making extra bland food to suit the taste of the elderly patrons.  This is watered down Chinese food, that's easy on the gums."}
{"text":"Ownership has changed. Wait staff has the regulars plus some new faces. Went there about a month ago and waitress (new one) was terrible. My WonTon soup was as good as always, but my Saturday special was tepid...seemed re-warmed. My wife's sweet 'n sour chicken was \"different\". She could tell it was a different cook. The weird bubble tea was \"meh\"....sad. Looks like we'll be searching for a new Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"Best chinese food, been coming here for years nothing compares. Fried rice is amazing but gotta get the meal the side isn't as good."}
{"text":"20+ year customer. Service, quality, and taste has always been top notch. Hands down, my favorite Chinese restaurant. I cannot eat egg rolls or won ton soup anywhere else as these are the best I've had. Anywhere. We always order the usual: egg roll, won ton soup, sweet and sour chicken, shrimp with lobster sauce, and general tso chicken. Highly recommend! We make a 30 minute drive just to eat here"}
{"text":"In the dirty streets of Westview, there glistens a diamond in the rough: Chan's Tea House, home of the best eggroll in the tri state area. Long have I frequented this lovely eatery and rarely have I been disappointed. The food is always divine, the setting soft and tradtional, the service excellent. Try the hot and sour soup, an eggroll and General Tso's. 

5/5 clams."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today for lunch with my father.  For as many years as I have lived close to Chan's, I had never actually been there.  That all changed due to a recent mailing that I received from them showing their lunch specials to be reasonably priced.  Upon entering the restaurant I was actually quite impressed by the cleanliness of the place, the decor and open floor plan.  They have what looks like an awning running around the inside and some giant Chinese vases.

After we were seated the waitress came over almost immediately with some waters and also a pot of hot tea.  For lunch I decided to go with the Hunan Beef, extra spicy with fried rice and a bowl of hot and sour soup. The soup came out first and had a nice tartness to it as well as some vegetables and what looked like some ground beef.  Almost immediately after we had finished our soup, the meals came out.  There were nice portions of both the fried rice and the hunan beef.  All of the vegetables from the hunan beef had a nice crispness to them and the beef tasted good as well.  The real star though was the sauce which had a nice flavor and also a bit of spiciness although not too spicy.  By the end of the meal I was full and very satisfied although not too full and it had only taken us about 25 minutes.  I am sure if we had wanted to that we could have eaten at a more leisurely pace but since it was lunch time we were happy to have that pace.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Chan's again.  I enjoyed both the decor of the restaurant as well as the food and thought that the food was better than most of the other Chinese restaurants around."}
{"text":"I come here often. It's a great place to go with my friends and family. The restruant itself isn't too busy, except for Friday and Saturday nights and still then it isn't too bad. The waitresses are always very kind and the food comes out relatively quickly. I always go for the general Tsos Chicken. It's very good and crispy, but a little fatty. Great taste! Also ordering takeout is a great option the lunch special is a great deal."}
{"text":"Overpriced for quality of food. We usually go to Sesame Inn off of McKnight road and thought we could try something closer. We will definitely be going back to Sesame Inn. Sesame Inn's prices are the same and the quality and quantity is way better for what you pay. We always have enough left over for second meals."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced, but you are given a large amount of it. I find it to be rather bland, especially for Chinese food. In the past, I have ordered sesame chicken, egg rolls, and general tsos, which have all been bland, with the general toss sauce being too thick. The interior of the restaurant needs some  work, as it is outdated and a little darker than I personally like."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Chinese in Pittsburgh by far. As a native pittsburgher I've tried most Chinese places around town and this one takes the cake. Delicious and generous portions. Great shrimp fried rice and I could eat the egg rolls all day everyday. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"If your starving, this is the place to come. You'll leave stuffed and satisfied everytime. The prices are very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Chan's for 30 years and always rated other Chinese restaurants benchmarked by Chan's.  We just came back from wintering in the South and decided to do take out from Chan's.  For the first time, we were underwhelmed by the food. First, my son-in-law ordered Chicken with Broccoli with General Tso sauce, but when he opened his takeout order, there was no General Tso sauce. My wife and daughters' chicken dishes were bland with little meat and the chicken they did have was chewy. The egg rolls were bland and contained few shrimp.  Finally, the previous owners made their own tasty duck sauce and gave you containers, now the duck sauce comes in prepackaged tear open packets which every other Chinese restaurant uses. We give 2 stars for Chan's and their new owners.  The fried rice and the shrimp with lobster sauce still had the old Chan's quality. We will start looking for another Chinese restaurant. SAD"}
{"text":"After having lived in the area for years, and having eaten there one other time, many years ago, I looked forward to our take out order.  That was, until we actually started eating.  My wife's chicken chow mein was very bland, soupy, and mostly onions, with very little chicken, and small pieces of what chicken there was.  My shrimp lo mein was also unsatisfactory, and overcooked.  The fried dumplings were, as just about all of the rest of the  food, riddled with onions.  The sauce for the dumplings was too ginger-heavy for either our tastes.  The kicker? After placing our order over the phone, I asked how long, and was told ten minutes.  At first, that sounded great, but then you realize that's only because so much of their food is pre-made, and likely sitting around waiting to be microwaved just before they expect you.  Not satisfied, and not going back.  Ever."}
{"text":"Used to love Chan's. Made our usual take out order. My sweet and sour chicken was terrible. The batter was mushy and chicken was raw inside. Found out the other day that the restaurant was sold to new owners about a month ago. I found out my experience was not isolated. Apparently the new owners did not keep the cooks and have changed many things. I will not be back, ever."}
