{"text":"Good but not great. Red sauce was traditional. Spinach stems might have been trimmed.  Stuffed pepper ap was cooked nicely but stuffing might have been more savory."}
{"text":"If you have ever had real Italian food, or simply prefer food without hair in it, this is not your place."}
{"text":"Very  disappointed. I was there  for lunch  but never  got to eat  After I  was taken  to my table  I sat there  for 10 minutes  without  even getting  a glass of water.  The server  came in several times to give checks to other tables,there were  only 2 ,she never even looked my way. When I  got  up to leave I told her why  I  was  leaving  she just said she forgot about  me. Never even apologized."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been here several times and we must say we love everything about this place. From the staff and owners who are always very accommodating,friendly and knowledgeable... To the ambiance and finely appointed decor and contemporary casual atmosphere in this hidden treasure it is worth the finding. Each time we have gone we have order something different.they offer daily specials or try something off the menu,you won't be disappointed. Don't see something you like or want to tweak something you see just ask and they will prepare it for you. We enjoy the out experience so much we are planning to hold our small intimate wedding reception there! Yes...they do parties,events and catering. This is a must experience rare gem hidden right off the parkway east and PA turnpike!  My goodness I sound like their PR person...hmmm Maybe I will go in for dinner and discuss.lol Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been waiting anxiously for Gia Visto to open and were excited to visit the restaurant with friends a few days after its opening.  We never imagined how tastefully the restaurant would be decorated.  The atmosphere is casual yet elegant.  The mix of colors and textures is amazing and creates a very comfortable and visually appealing room for dining.   We visited Gia Visto at 7:00 on a Friday night and were seated immediately despite the fact that the restaurant was busy.  The wait staff was attentive and quickly opened and poured our wine (bring your own).  We started with a pizza appetizer that was easily split among our party of four.  The pizza was so delicious we contemplated ordering more but ultimately decided that we wanted to try more of the menu items.    I ordered the bruco pasta with the spicy lamb ragu and have been thinking about it ever since.  It was possibly the best pasta I have ever tasted.  The past was obviously fresh and the sauce was flavored with what seemed to be fresh herbs and spices.  My wife's entr√©e - one of the pasta specials - was also excellent.  I am not very particular when it comes to demanding fresh food and honestly cannot always discern the freshness of cooked foods, but Gia Visto didn't leave me with any doubt about the quality and freshness of their ingredients.  We found our server to be friendly and attentive throughout our dining experience.  She was never intrusive but always seemed to know when we needed another bottle of wine opened or our water glasses refilled.  The food was delivered in a timely manner - not too slow as to make us wait but not too quickly as to make us feel rushed or unable to enjoy our time together.    Our experience at Gia Vista was exceptional from start to finish.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting, the service was superb and every bite of the food delicious.  We place this restaurant on top of our list of favorite places to dine and cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Super great and flavorful food. The place was getting packed around 5:30 on a Wednesday with what looked to be a middle aged crowd with lots of regulars (and lots of wine, its BYOB!). I minused a star for the menu being a little overpriced for pasta and the waitress was amazing but she was the only one in a packed dining room.  Will definitely return with friends and wine!"}
{"text":"Had my bridal shower here today and the girls went above and beyond! Food was fantastic! Jill was such a great help and couldn't be more thankful. If you're planning a mall event like a bridal or baby shower this is the place to be! All my events will be here for sure!"}
{"text":"The ambience is fine: friendly service and a cozy atmosphere. The food, unfortunately, is not up to par. The presentation of the dishes was solid, but ultimately the meal was a case of flash over substance as the food was underwhelming.   I ordered the hanger steak with side farro salad. The salad could have been good had the ratio of ingredients been more balanced. My salad was 90% farro, 10% everything else combined. I felt like I was eating a bowl of grains rather than an artisan salad. The hanger steak entree was wholly disappointing. For $27, you receive ~5oz of rough quality meat, some spinach and garlic, and roasted potatoes. The advertised goat cheese and pancetta may have made things more interesting if they were anywhere to be found.   I really wanted to like this place, but from beginning to end the meal was dissatisfying. I even picked a safe dish (hanger) to avoid disappointment but somehow the rare, tender hanger I was expecting came out tasting like slightly burnt flank.  Bottom line: Their attempt to be fancy fell flat in my eyes; food was overpriced and the flavor combinations put together just did not work."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed this restaurant for many years but this evening's experience will be our last.  Inedible doesn't begin to describe what we experienced tonight.  Bad service, congealed and over-cooked, over-seasoned pasta, substandard ingredients, incorrect orders, and disproportionately high prices.  Not sure what happened here, but we won't be back to find out.  It's a shame -- this used to be a great little spot.  Seems like the prior staff who cared about the product has been taken over by food zombies. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Had dinner this past Saturday with 2 other couples. The food was good but cold. The service was abominable. The restaurant was full, yet we saw only 2 servers. Had to ask for water twice before we got it and bread twice as well. Most of us got pasta dishes and we were never offered grated Parmesan. It took way too long to be served both salads and entrees and when the entrees finally arrived they were cold.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My first time there I I found it on yelp food was fantastic service was excellent I would highly recommend it to anyone nice and cozy the appetizers were amazing the grilled salmon exceptional! Great place for a first date if you want to impress someone take them there"}
{"text":"Great place.   Food is delicious, had the lamb rigatoni and short rib pasta.   No liquor license but you can bring your own bottle.   I'd call it upscale Italian with great flavors.  Service is good but not fantastic.   If you're in the area it's definately worth a try!"}
{"text":"I went here with 2 friends last night for the first time. The bruschetta was unique and very good. 3 different toppings. Plenty to share for us. I ordered the spinach gnocchi. Wow...loved it. Our bill was $20 a piece. I left very full. I would recommend this restaurant to everybody."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed in our meals here. My family is Italian, so we love to find local, authentic Italian spots- this is not that. We were the only people here at dinner time on a Wednesday night, so I can't help but wander if the reviews are stacked? Or else from previous management? There is no way someone could find this place \"charming\" or \"intimate\"... Very odd decor and ambiance, and certainly not my idea of clean. Servers were not friendly. Bread was stale. My husband and I each ordered the chicken Romano- the chicken was thick and rubbery and the texture did not resemble anything close to chicken. The spaghetti that accompanied it was far from special- ragu and boxed noodles. The best thing about the meal were the House made salad dressings. Neither of us finished our entrees. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Gia Visto many times over the years.  We went recently and food was even better than I'd remembered.  We'll be going here more often in the future.  We went early on Saturday evening so getting a table was not a problem.  We ordered beans and green with chicken for an appetizer.  This has always been one of my favorites here.  It is spectacular... garlicky and awesomeness!  I tried the farro and kale salad which had beets, dried cherries, goat cheese and a mustard vinaigrette.  I'll definitely be getting that again!  My entree was crab cakes served with spaghetti aglio olio and vegetables. When I ordered, I asked what the vegetables were and after checking with the kitchen, I was informed it was whatever I wanted!  I had spinach, red peppers, broccoli and asparagus.  Once again, perfect.  My husband and son both had the rigatoni with lamb bolognese and they're still talking about it!  Bring wine and good friends for a lovely evening out!"}
{"text":"What can I say except EXCEPTIONAL!!! From start to finish Planning to Day of was Awesome. Not only was the food outstanding, Jill and the staff customized the table settings, floral arrangements, and even the menu!! This was for my brothers wedding rehearsal dinner, and I had arrangements with a hotel until I came across Gia Visto. More options, better service, and they care!!! They prepared food for my brother and sister in law for after the wedding , and for me too! I was able to make my event feel like I was having it in my own home. The ambiance is amazing! and Chef Eric worked with me to make my menu special for the newly weds who loved Italian food. The salmon was great and the award winning Bolognese was just that. Other than the wedding itself it was the highlight of our weekend. My only complaint is that Gia Visto isn't in Atlanta!!! As a event planner, and a former restaurant manager, I have pretty high expectations and they were met and then some. Thanks Gia Visto!!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade gnocchi with vodka sauce. So good!! Highly recommend. The bread basket was also delish."}
{"text":"Skeptical at first because of mixed reviews. But such a nice and quiet ambience, perfect for a date or with a little one like us. I had the risotto which was very good and hubby got the lamb rigatoni, oh so good too. Wouldn't mind coming back for more if ever we're in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch here with family. Pretty traditional Italian fare at an affordable price. Service was good, and the highlight of my meal was the Ricotta gnocchi in vodka sauce."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an early lunch on a Friday. I was really excited about it because of all the great reviews and the menu looked pretty good. Earlier that morning, someone in the Monroeville area had given us some lunch recommendations, and when we mentioned this place as a possibility, he said it is overpriced for what you get. We decided to check it out for ourselves.  We found the restaurant in a small shopping center off of the main road. The inside was a lot smaller than I expected, however, it was nicely decorated for Christmas. We were seated right next to the window, and being that we were the first ones in the restaurant, I'm not quite sure why since it was the coldest part of the room. Our hostess/waitress was nice, however didn't quite appear ready to start the day. She wasn't sure what the soup of the day was and her conversations with the cook were clearly heard in the whole restaurant. However, she was attentive, quick to take our order and always on top of refilling our water.  For my meal, I decided I had to go with an Italian dish since it was an Italian restaurant. I went with a specialty pasta: Farfalle, sweet sausage, spinach, and white beans with a splash of tomato basil sauce. The portion was perfect for lunch and the food was alright, but I felt I could make this dish at home. My husband went with an olive oil pasta with tuna and tomatoes and he felt the same way. The guy we ran into earlier in the day was correct, a tad overpriced for what you get. We did have bread and butter to start our meals, so that helped justify the lunch price.   Overall, this was a nice place to try. Slightly overpriced for the quality, but service was fast, waitress was nice, and the place was beautifully decorated and clean."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.   I live in Austin, and grew up in PIttsburgh's east side. I never knew just how spoiled I was by PA italian food until I left and moved to the south where...at least in Austin, italian is miserably pale comparison to what I can get at so many places in Pittsburgh. Gias is FABULOUS in my book, one of the best italian places in Pittsburgh IMO... I wish I could bottle all this deliciousness up and take it with me but I can't. So I'll just keep dreaming about the awesome meal I had here until I'm back in PA.  Things to know: The interior is warm and charming. Space is very limited so make reservations in evenings and on weekends. You need to bring your own wine. Service is good...our waitress wasn't fawning but she was polite and didn't miss a beat in execution.   Oh yea, the FOOD! We got these things and thought this about them:  - Eggplant parmesan- very best I've had. Lightly crispy, not too heavily cheesy, and heavenly sauce. - Beet salad- good, light. PICKLED FENNEL!! Why do more places not have this?? So good. Need to learn how to make. Would be an epic hit at gastropubs. - Ceasar salad- we all agreed it was the least impressive. Dressing was heavy and a little too fishy. About 1/3 as much dressing would have improved the salad greatly. Still everything else was awesome so they get a pass here. - Homeade ricotta gnocchiI! If you get nothing else here get the Gnocchi with roasted red pepper sauce. I'd probably honestly make it my last meal on earth. - Homeade Rigatoni with tomato basil sauce. So delicious, just a perfect simple and beautiful bowl of pasta. - Pork Shoulder with puscanetta- didn't have any but it got rave reviews from everyone.  - Tiramisu and mini cannoli, and a house coffee. Dessert to die for.  I'd easily eat here and die happy."}
{"text":"Restaurant is tucked away in a little strip mall, above a long driveway, not visible from Old William Penn.   The food was probably 4 stars.  Appetizers:  adequate  Caesar Salad, but with grated cheese rather than shaved, and no anchovies offered. Beans and Greens was dry (no broth at all), but garlicky and flavorful.  Entrees: Romano chicken and pasta desperately needed more red sauce, but we never saw our server again.  Roasted Salmon was the best dish of the evening - beautifully prepared with cranberry beans, fingerling potatoes, and pesto - very lovely, very tasty. The problem was the service.  We arrived early, and found only a few other diners in the two -room restaurant.  We were seated immediately and given water... then were ignored for a very long time.  The waitress did finally appear to take our order.  Three more LONG gaps ensued... before the appetizers, before the entrees, and (most annoyingly) while we were sitting there, obviously finished, holding a credit card and waiting for the check.  (We finally flagged down the hostess and asked for a check.)  As noted above, we would have like more red sauce with the meal... but the Absent Server made that impossible.  BYOB =- $4 corking fee  FIve stars for gluten-free and vegetarian menus.  Nicely Done. Four stars for food - also quite nice. One star for service, and we will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best Italian Resturant in Monroeville!!! The sauces are bursting with flavor,  the pastas are perfectly cooked and you can tell everything is homemade. Also,  the prices are completely reasonable.  I have found my new \"go to\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I love the food at this place.  I've been there 3 times.  Twice for lunch and once for dinner.  This time I had the steamed mussels for an appetizer and they were delicious.  The tomato based sauce is very flavorful with a bit of a kick.  I also had the caesar salad which was very good.  My entree was the rigatoni with lamb shank, again, also very good.  My reason for not giving it a higher rating is the level of service.  By no means is the service terrible but it seems to be a bit rough around the edges.  The wait staff seems a bit awkward and not friendly and engaging.  When we walked in there was no one there to greet us and no one acknowledged our presence for about 3-4 minutes despite several people walking by.  Just say hello someone will be right with, even if you're just the kitchen help.  When we were seated it took another 4-5 minutes for someone to come to the table.  It took 25 minutes to get bread which they said they would bring straight away.  Also, we asked for cream and sugar for our coffee and they forgot to bring the sugar.  The meal took an entire 2 hours.  That is not a huge deal especially for what seems to be very freshly prepared food but they really could be more efficient.  I am definitely going back for the food but hoping for better service."}
{"text":"Was very nice.  This was my first time here and I took my sister, her husband and some others, 7 total.  Some in my party didn't think the portions were that big but I thought they were fine.  The appetizers were very good, the bread was fantastic, the service was exceptional.  I'd go back.  Just a quaint little Italian place that was thoroughly enjoyed."}
{"text":"Very delicious homemade Italian food. The BEST Vodka sauce and Eggplant Parm we have ever had!! Quiet and small so make reservations if its a Thurs, Fri, or Sat.  And BYOB."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that this restaurant believes in seasoning. The pasta had no salt. The aglio e olio sauce had very little garlic. The wedding soup was way under seasoned. I was anxious to try this place, but think it will unfortunately be my first and last time."}
{"text":"My husband and i came here after finding it on trip advisor with such good reviews for valentine's day, but we didn't go out until the 17th. We brought our own wine, and sat down, everything was great, except for the service. Our waitress was slightly snarky and rude. My husband and I are a younger couple (22 & 26) and I felt as though the waitress didn't feel we were 'worth it' to give good service to due to the fact that she had 4 other tables of middle aged business men, whom she figured would tip her better than we would since we were 'so young'. This was just purely my opinion, but she was very rude, giving us a weird look when we brought out our wine bottle. (This place is byob) we will be back, but not for the service, purely for the food. The food was out of this world! It was delicious, with just the right amount of spice. All of the layers of flavors melted together beautifully, the people in the kitchen truly know what they're doing! The only complaint i could have was that the molten chocolate cake wasn't molten on the inside, but I can forgive that. Hopefully next time we can get some good service, maybe it'd be a 5 star then, but the horrid service really ruined what should have been a beautiful evening for us."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan.  My family members are all big fans.  My coworkers are big fans.  My clients are big fans.  You should be a big fan too.  And if you're not, then get out of my face with your nonsense because it's delicious.       My parents started making Gia Visto a regular dinner spot a while ago and I was always down to meet them there if I found out they were going.  I never really thought about it for lunch until recently.  Their lunch is great.  Really, we have clients in our office every Wednesday for lunch and every single Wednesday for the last 4 months, they've requested that we pick up from Gia Visto.  Their salmon over greens and beans, cooked in olive oil with tomato jam, is one of the best salmon dishes in the Pittsburgh area.  All of their salads are great, too... the shrimp caprese, in particular.  The dining room is cozy and intimate.  It's BYOB.  It's kick-ass.  Stop being such a freaking goofball and go eat there for the love of God.  Places like this need to stay open."}
{"text":"Wow. The best Italian meal I've had in quite some time. I got the spinach gnocchi and farro kale salad. So fresh and flavorful. Will definitely be back. Love how it's BYOB too. You've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Hello I'm talking about the kids cooking class it is a great thing.  My son had a great time.  They had pizza and pasta for lunch.  The dinner he made and brought home for the family was delicious.  Definitely will be doing this again."}
{"text":"We were very dissatisfied with the food&the  service was very slow,I had ordered penne with meatballs,&the meatballs tasted very  funny,must have been some kind of mystery meat? I sent them back&they gave me sausage instead which was good!The sauce was very sweet almost sugary.My wife had beef bracciole which was burnt& her sauce was very watery! Our biil came to around $60&it was not at all worth it,I was looking for some good homemade Italian cooking&it wasnt even close!We could have went to several other places for less money for instance Olive Garden&it would have been better!Ill say one thing that was good was their homemade bread,Ill give that an A grade! The waitress was  friendly&kept apologizing fort he food&slow service,We will definitely not be returning there!"}
{"text":"The menu is unique, diverse, and delicious! The atmosphere is a little strange but the food is definitely worth checking out. I love that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Delicious! Very attentive staff and very nice. They let me basically build my own meal without a complaint and it was amazing. The breaded chicken could not have been cooked any better than what it was! I also had the arancini app which is a go to for me at any Italian restaurant and it was fabulous. I believe baked, not fried, which I really liked. All around great experience. It is BYOB though, just a heads up!"}
{"text":"Gia Visto is a wonderful authentic Italian restaurant hidden gem of Monroeville. Gia by far is the best restaurant in Monroeville. I have been here several times and have not been disappointed once. The quality of food and the service are top notch.   I found a discount coupon in  one of the entertainment books and decided to give this restaurant a try. I was so pleasantly surprised and enjoyed every moment and every morsel. I love the cozy atmosphere and decor. It is also nice that they have a restroom on each side of the restaurant.   Gia Visto is a BYOB and from seeing others around me, it truly is one that people appreciate and take advantage of. The cork fee is minimal, with no issue in paying it.  The food is freshly prepared with personal care. Highly Recommend !!  I hope they keep the word of mouth going and make this a successful restaurant, but I don't want it to get to crowded that I can't get a seat !  Gia is definitely in the restaurant rotation list, I do suggest that you make a reservation, it fills up quickly.   Love this Place !!"}
{"text":"I read all the reviews that were posted before we made s reservation  I felt good and excited to go to dine there. 6of us went there for my daughters birthday. We had a reservation for 730 on Saturday the 13 th We arrived at 720 and was seated by 730 The resturant was crowded.  We were given menus and a drink order was taken When the drinks were brought to us is when all the confusion started The menu was long and all mixed up with both sides not very understandable  Ok so I figured I would just ask the waitress right? Not really  She didn't even understand it and had to run back in the kitchen for answers She brought bread which was homemade and good but in the basket was 6little pieces not enough for 2 people I ordered gnocchi with red roasted pepper sauce after a 5 minute dissertation on which sauces had or did not have onions At 815 roughly 35 min after we ordered I flagged the waitress down and asked her where our soups and said was  She told they were coming right out  Finally at 830 we got out soups and salads  At 850  a young an in a grunge. Tossil cap and and t shirt brought our meals  He was dirty looking (very un professional) Now the food was hot and good but the portions were very skimpy. My gnocchi were 19.50 .for that I received 13 small pieces of gnocchi. That is more than 1 dollar for each piece. I not asking for the world for 19.50 but that was ridiculous  Every one else had very small portions too. Our waitress did make sure our drinks were refilled but that was all.  The service although the food was good not excellent was very very poor and unprofessional. I left there knowing that the food was ok but I could not recommend this resturant to anyone and would never go back there 2 stars only because the food was ok everything else terrible Ang B"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in Monroeville! Everything is homemade. Do bring your own bottle to go with the delicious food. I had the Rockfish over risoto,and it was perfect. Save room for their dessert. Best Tirisamu  I have had in a long time. I am new to the area,so like to try the local flair vs a chain. I will be back,yummy!"}
{"text":"Beautiful, cozy dining room decorated with glassware and art. The server started us with a nice basket of bread. The Caesar Salad had just the right amount of garlic and the unusual addition of grape tomatoes and Kalamata olives. I had the Butternut Squash Risotto with Brussel Sprouts and Hazelnuts. I prefer risotto over pasta whenever I can get it, and it didn't disappoint!  My sister had the Lamb Rigatoni and was very happy with it. Both portions were too much to eat at once and we had them boxed to have for lunch the next day. The only disappointment is that they don't serve wine and we didn't know that before we went. You have to bring your own, and their corking fee is $4.00. I wish that had been more obvious on their website. Upon further research the next day, I found the corking fee at the bottom of the Lunch Menu. They need to move it to the Dinner Menu, when most people will be drinking wine."}
{"text":"I have read the reviews and went to visit the place. The atmosphere is really nice but not all the food is great. I had a putanesca pasta and it was so bad, hard and tasteless. I would not recommend all dishes, my partner had another pasta and his was better. I guess there is not a consistency. Luck? ...."}
{"text":"Very nice Italian.  Everyone in our group of 11 loved their dinner.  The Penne Visto chicken is the best chicken pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken is marinated and thinly sliced.  Absolutely perfect taste and texture.  My sister in law loved the Trenne pasta with veal and sausage.  Great veggie selection Kombocha squash risotto satisfied both of the veg people in our group.  The farro salad with beets, kale, grapefruit, cranberries was quite delicious.  Eggplant Parm is luscious.  Service was excellent.  Bonus for our group: it's BYOB.  Worth passing five Italian joints to come here. Only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the lack of whole wheat pasta."}
{"text":"5 outta 5 Stars 10000%...the food speaks for itself but the service is phenomenal as well & that's what we love...Cheryl is so professional, accommodating, and cordial. She knows what she's doing and her wine and dinner recommendations made our meal even more delightful. My fianc√© got the crab raviolis paired with the Sauvignon blanc (cant remember the name) and I had the spinach gnocchi, absolutely delicious. Literally melted in my mouth!!! Unreal. this was our 3rd visit and we will be back, we come from a family that owns a brand new italian restaurant in new castle pa, so we know & appreciate all the hard work and talent each of you bring to the table! Thanks for the great experience, btw we literally tell everyone about CENACOLO!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I had lunch at this adorable place yesterday, 2/25/2017 and we definitely will be back!!  We started off with the Beans and Greens with Sausage.  The sausage was so mouthwatering and the beans and greens were seasoned perfectly!  For our 2nd course, Nick had a Chicken Caesar Salad, which he said was the best he ever had (and he's had a lot of Caesar salads).  I had  the Chicken, pear and Mixed greens Salad with Candied Walnuts, Feta and White Balsamic Dressing.  Was very, very good!  For our main entree, we both got the Pasta Visto: Penne with Chicken, Roasted Tomatoes, Spinach, Garlic and Feta.  One word:  OUTSTANDING....thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were visiting the area to see relatives and came in for dinner.  We found  the restaurant to be warm and inviting.  The pastas were homemade and the quality of the food was excellent. My wife had Romano Chicken and I had Gnocchi.   The staff and service was outstanding.   They made us feel very welcome."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturdays ago with my wife and her parents for lunch.  Whenever we walked in we were immediately greeted by the hostess and taken to our seats.  That meant that we walked through what I think was a childrens cooking class where it looked like they were making pizzas.  How cool is that? I think it is awesome that Gia Visto puts on kids cooking classes once a month for those inspiring kid cooks.  After making it through the class and into the main dining room we were seated at a 4 top.  The inside of their restaurant is cozy and has pictures from a lot of famous places.  After perusing their lunch menu I decided to order the risotto with chicken, parmesan and spinach.  It was delivered about 20 minutes later after some other members of my party had finished their soups.  Whenever I tried the risotto I thought that it tasted ok.  The rice in it was cooked nicely so it was neither hard nor overly mushy.  There was an ample amount of spinach and the chicken tasted ok too.  Where it missed the mark was that I found it to be pretty bland and singular tasting with no depth of flavor.  So while there wasn't anything wrong with my meal I also didn't find anything exciting about it either.  The rest of my table ended up ordering shrimp caprese salad and it looked pretty good and they were all happy with it.  The bottom line for me is that I would give Gia Visto another chance in the future.  While this visit wasn't what I would consider a good meal for me, it is possible that I chose poorly and could have had a better experience with a better entree choice."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for lunch on a Friday afternoon.  We were in the area and found this place while browsing the Enjoy coupon book.  Being one of the first to arrive, we were quickly seated.  On the way in, I noticed that there was an advertisement for kids cooking classes there.  I thought that was a very fun thing to do for kids and promote the business.    The dining room had a very different look depending on where you sat. The front of the restaurant next to the windows was very bright with lots of natural light while the seats in the back looked quite dim.  I didn't mind sitting next to the window and shortly thereafter we were brought a menu and some slices of bread.  The bread was good; it tasted fresh and smelled slightly of yeast. It came with packaged butter and was a pleasant start to a lunch where we were both starving!  My wife and I were able to exercise self control and saved some bread to go with the meal.  She ended up getting the Farfelle with sausage and white beans while I ordered a tuna, tomato, and garlic penne.  While we waited for our food the room started to fill in with some of the lunch crowd. My dish turned out to be alright.  I appreciated the combination of tuna and pasta as it seemed to work well, however I didn't think this was anything special. There was a satisfactory amount of tuna in it as well.  One thing I really liked about this place for lunch was the portion sizes were perfect. I ended up feeling full but not hating myself and not trying to stuff food in just to avoid taking home a small amount of leftovers.  Overall the food was OK and I wouldn't be opposed to coming back here, but I didn't find anything that I really liked about this place other than the portion sizes and the kids cooking classes."}
{"text":"Great, homemade food cooked well, with great service. The bread was fresh and tasty, the pastas were cooked just right and the sauces were very tasty, especially the vodka sauce that was creamy tomato perfection. The ONLY thing that wasn't really good was the wedding soup that my husband got. It was all spinach, few meatballs, no pasta, and really bland. My salad was small, but extremely tasty - I got the gorgonzola dressing and it had a bite to it that was an excellent contrast to the baby lettuce and golden raisins and nuts added as a topper. The tiramisu was creamy and light and not too sweet. Our waitress was FAST and very efficient and attentive without being annoying. We went on Saturday at 7 pm and were seated without a reservation so I don't think that too many people know that this place is so good! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food was pretty good. Great bread for dipping and food was steaming hot."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Visiting from Phila while and was looking for a nice dinner while visiting CCAC. My husband and I   took a chance and glad we did.  Took the recommendations from our excellent waitress. Italian wedding soup, scallops wrapped in a fontina cheese shell, caesar salad, romano crusted baked chicken, tomato basil sauce with penne pasta, and a delightful salmon dish. Yes, it was just the two of us. PS, the bread and butter was wonderful too."}
{"text":"The food was excellent!!!  The menu is very simple, not a whole lot of options beside pasta but the pasta was very good, I would say their tomato basil sauce is very, very similar to my homemade sauce, which is a huge compliment!! The ambiance is very romantic, great atmosphere!!  Now for my one and only complaint.... we were there at 4;30 on a Saturday for dinner and we were the only ones in the dining room except the waitresses and possibly a manager that were setting up for dinner.  We were first given a lunch menu, at 4:30??  They had to check to see if the kitchen was ready for dinner before we could order, again...at 4:30???  The entire time we were there, they were moving chairs, moving tables, setting place settings, moving back and forth.... we couldn't enjoy our quiet little dinner.  So my advice is to wait until ATLEAST 5pm to go there."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem in the rat race of chain and fast food restaurants in Monroeville. Yelp led my sister and me there for lunch. The restaurant is tastefully decorated and has a nice ambiance with an Italian vibe. We each ordered a salad. I had the chicken and pear and my sister had the steak. Both were delicious! We also enjoyed the basket of bread brought to us. Thanks to yelp, we checked in and got a free dessert, which was a homemade berry crisp. It was outstanding! Our server was very friendly and welcoming and she made the crisp herself. This is a great place to go to escape the congestion and crowds in Monroeville and enjoy a relaxing and tasty meal."}
{"text":"A group of eight of us recently had dinner on  a Friday night here to celebrate a family member's birthday. Despite its location in a slightly out of the way strip mall, the atmosphere is very nice and the food is simply outstanding. And an added bonus...it's BYOB. Several of their pasta's, and both the regular Italian bread as well as the foccacia are house-made, as are all of their desserts.  We started out with the greens and beans and the bruschetta appetizers, which we all shared. Each dinner came with a salad, either a standard mixed salad or a kale salad, which I had, and it was very good. Two of us had the house-made pappardelle with shrimp, spinach and mushrooms in a white wine cream sauce, which was fabulous. Two other people in our party had the house-made gnocchi., also excellent. Someone else had the scallops with sweet pea risotto, also very good. I can't remember what the other people ordered, but we all loved the food! Prices are very reasonable, and our server was friendly and attentive. This is now my new \"go-to\" Italian restaurant. I highly recommend it"}
{"text":"Great Food, absolutely great!! We came here on a whim looking for somewhere new to eat in Monroeville and boy am I happy I stumbled in here.   The ambience is very casual and yet elegant. You can bring your own wine although they do have a corkage fee I believe (not completely sure). The menu has plenty of items and since it's an Italian restaurant they give you out of this world portions.   I ordered the trout entree with a side farro salad. The salad was huge, literally enough of r2 or 3 people to share. It came with beets, kale and walnuts and a few other touches but the dressing wasn't too appeasing to me. My husbands salad had a tomato balsamic dressing which was great so I asked her to add it to mine instead and it really improved the flavor. He ordered gnocchi in a tomato base sauce that also came with large olives that were very good and tangy.  My trout was packed with flavor and tasted very fresh. It was accompanied by braised red cabbage and a sweet potato souffl√©. It was like the perfect bite, trout, cabbage and sweet potato all in one. Excellent!! The cabbage I have to rave about because they made it sweet and oh so buttery. I loved each bite. My husband too enjoyed his food and we even shared a dessert together. Apple pie a la mode. The apples weren't cooked as soft as I like them but it was still a decent dessert.  This place will definitely be added to my goto list of places to eat. plus the menu changes weekly which is a good thing because I'm all about new dishes :D"}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, the service is slow even when the place is not busy. My go to is the eggplant parmesan, which is my favorite food and although it is my favorite in the city, I do not find myself visiting all that often as I feel the portions are a bit small. When ordering eggplant parm I wind expect to have more than 2 small pieces stop a small serving of pasta."}
{"text":"Wow this was an amazing meal. My customers picked this place for dinner and I had no idea what to expect though you will not be disappointed. Everything we had was wonderful. We started with greens and beans appetizer this was cooked properly and very fresh. The house salad was good and different with a white balsamic and yellow raisins among the many toppings. For dinner we all had different dishes though since I was a newbie they insisted I tried their dishes all 3 dishes were different though all so good. From the huge pork chops, to the Bolognese to my dish with pasta and clams I enjoyed all three. We also had a chocolate cake with ice cream which was also good. If I lived in the area I would be a regular! This is certainly going to be my go to going forward when in this part of Pittsburgh! I am so glad my clients shared this gem with me!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this hidden gem. My fiancee and I had enough time to grab lunch together last Friday and after rummaging around her glove box for coupons and cross checking yelp we settled in for Gia Visto.  We found are way to a small unimpressive strip mall at first unsure if it was even open due to a lack of lighting we could see from the outside. We walked up and went in the find it to be cozy and romantically lit. You walk in and first see the kitchen/prep room, which isn't so great but their expanded dining room was very nice and cleanly decorated.   We looked over the menu and each picked an entr√©e- my fiance chose the chicken risotto with spinach and I got the eggplant parm spaghetti. The bread we got was a little burnt and left us underwhelmed. However the food was absolutely incredible!! We both couldn't stop eating the delicious entrees that we had ordered! We were so satisfied that we even ordered dessert on the spur of the moment- which was also delicious might I add.  Overall food is 5 stars worthy. The reason for the 4th star review is just for average service and a pretty outdated exterior. All in all, you definitely should add this to a must stop for any date night or outing in the Monroeville area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Friendly service, and the owner is also the chef.  Everything is prepared fresh to order.  Not your usual Italian fare.  Great small plates, wonderful entrees.  My husband generally picks one of the pasta dishes, and yesterday was no exception.  Farfalle with italian sausage, cannellini beans and spinach was a hit.  I ordered the BEST GRILLED CHEESE ever!  White cheddar, bacon, fig spread on crusty bread.  BYO wine, too.  Oh, and the bread...Thanks, Jill.  Thanks, Anna, for turning us on to this little gem."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a very good meal this evening. We had gnocchi in vodka sauce, gnocchi in a spicy sauce with roasted pork shoulder, and salmon. All 3 dishes were very good. The tomato bisque was delish. Fudge cake and date pudding dessert- yum. BYOB."}
{"text":"It's off the beaten path with an unassuming store front in a lil' strip mall.  And you're greeted by a peculiar, old screen door.  Yet it's quite an amazing Italian bistro.  Should you stumble upon the place in Monroeville, you will find interesting seasonal pastas among other dishes you normally don't see.  Further their fresh baked bread + oil/spices to start was delicious.  It's BYOB, but there is plenty of ambience without it.  And service was outstanding.  A return trip is definitely in order.  Now go...just go."}
{"text":"I dine here a few times a year for lunch. I really like their roasted red pepper and vodka sauces on any of the pasta options (but do try the ricotta gnocchi!). Add a meatball or two and you have the makings of an excellent meal. All pastas are between 7-10 dollars and are decently portioned for lunch servings.   I also very much enjoy their paninis with the chicken/goat cheese/roasted red pepper being my favorite!   I never enjoyed \"beans and greens\" before I tried it here. I'll admit it is very tasty, with fresh tomatoes and white wine sauce.   The dinner menu is larger and slightly more expensive, but lacks the lunch paninis (I'm not sure if they are still available, so ask!) Large plate stars include the flank steak and the pork shank.  The place is BYOB and corking fee is a modest $4.   Keep in mind, however, that the place is tiny (probably only twenty tables total)! So either make a reservation or go during lunch. They also do several \"wine dinners\" over the course of the year.   One strange thing - it's an Italian restaurant with pictures of Prague everywhere. Not necessarily a bad thing ... just slightly out of place. Samoz?ejm? je mi jedno. ?esk√° Republika se mi l√≠b√≠!"}
