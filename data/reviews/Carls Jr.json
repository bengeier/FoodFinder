{"text":"They've gotten our order wrong literally every single time, or forgot to put something in our bag which we didn't notice until we got home.  When the order is correct the food is decent, but doesn't really matter when we have to drive all the back to have them correct there mistakes."}
{"text":"So dank my taste buds told me to write this review. Carl's is the best, hands down. If your craving cheap fast food and your not being picky this food will satisfy your needs. Forget the people who don't make minimum wage. because the people in the back making your food work hard and don't need any guff from you. Pay your five dollars and leave. Then go stuff your face."}
{"text":"I usually don't rate fast food places but the service at this Carl's Junior was more than I expected. The people here were so welcoming, they checked on me like 3 times to see if I needed anything else, and even took the time wish me a goodbye. I am definitely coming back, great customer Service!"}
{"text":"I know, it's fast food. But fast food can still be hot and tasty. This was disgusting. The bacon on my western chee was barely cooked, the chicken strips were old and dingy. and the fries were day-old stale and cold. To top that off, they forgot my honey mustard even though I reminded them twice. Go suck a big one, Carl's Jr on E Thomas! And kiss my butt!"}
{"text":"Waited 20minutes in the drive thru with no one in front or behind me. When they finally brought out the food, we told the manager we've been waiting that long and she says no, it's only been 10minutes! That my order was at 1:40. The food was delivered to the window at 2:04. Maybe she can't do math but having to wait that long is unacceptable. Called the 1-844 number on the receipt and am sent to a \"promotion line\" before I can speak to a manager about my concerns. Don't waste your time at this location!"}
{"text":"Horrible wait after a long exhausting day at the lake.  Will never visit this joint again.  Only 2 people were manning the store with folks in the drive-thru & in line.  Crazy!  Don't come here unless you have an hour to kill for a crappy burger."}
{"text":"There is one employee there that is extremely rude. She just basically throws your order at you and doesn't say anything you don't even have a chance to say thank you because she just slams the window shut!!! Horrible customer service. And she wasn't a teen either."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best fast food restaurants in Phoenix...and I can be a very picky guy! I used to live in the Biltmore area and often found myself stopping by for a quick bite. Their staff was ALWAYS friendly and kind...and food hot, fresh and tasty. I think their prices are good and I can honestly say I've never gotten a bad meal there.
As for the other review here, it may be possible this Carl's Jr location is a franchise and not financially linked with other restaurants with the same name. So...location may matter ALOT!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow service and food did not taste fresh but the biggest complaint is the \"large\" Fry's. When I got home the fries looked like someone ate a couple handfuls already. Pictures are being posted. Really? Carl's you need to fix this so you don't loose another customer over something so easy to avoid"}
{"text":"Grass fed burger was rancid. Hot dog was old. Soda machines not working. Service was slow.  Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome!! We didn't have a vehicle and they still took our order through the drive thru and treated us so wonderful!"}
{"text":"I need to remind myself to avoid this location and if I want Carl's, I'll go back up on Northern. Pulled up to the drive-thru, placed my order, turned the corner and saw 2 cars ahead of me.  Didn't see them as I was driving up.  Not a good sign.  10 minutes later, I finally got my food....but the wrong drin.  I pulled around and parked to walk in.  One person in line, several people with uniforms on but not sure they were actually working.  Finally get to the counter to tell the girl I got the wrong drink in drive-thru and she gave me a bit of an attitude.  I just took my correct drink and left.   Last time we went to that one, bacon cheese fries were a huge pile of fries, a drizzle of cheese sauce on top with cold bacon pieces.  Not much better this time!e around.  Northern Ave location has been friendly, accurate and good food every time.  I'm done with Westgate location."}
{"text":"Just rude to non-hispanics! Can't get help with our food. I was ignored for almost 10 minutes, then the manager told me to just add sugar to the regular tea when I asked if they had sweet tea.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The place is clean, phone number is wrong, staff is RUDE RUDE RUDE. Food was sub par for even fast food! Manager YELLING ! Out numbers and orders. Kids toy in bag was a joke. Carls Jr was the best when I was a young and now ive been to three locations near me and they are all awful."}
{"text":"How come Carl's Jr is a love/hate place for me. I can't choose if I appreciate the lonnnggg wait for fresh made food at a fast food place or if I hate It! To top it off, they never have tea when I go and if I ask for a soda it's always flat. Every. Single. Time."}
{"text":"OK, this location, I have tried and tried to like. I have never been inside, so I do not know if its clean or not. I always go through the drive thru.

First the staff is ok, some friendly and some, um... NOT!

Food is most of the time is off. I have had some Monster biscuits that have rocked!!  Carls Jr has the best biscuits in the QSR arena. -  BUT - they can not put out a quality, reliable product. I want the items to be approximately the same each time.  I have gotten biscuits and gravy here that are the best.. much better than Wataburgar. But now 80% of the time they are inedible. Watered down gravy not prepared correctly and they know it and still serve it to you and take your money. 

If you know the quality is not there...   why serve it?  OMG this irritates me.  I waited almost 20 minuted in the drive thru last week....  That's a long time BUT just like I told the cashier who apologized for the wait, \"I don't mind as long as the food is prepared correctly and its hot\".  She smiled and handed me the food.

I got to work and found one of the items all over the bottom of the bag and The gravy so thin it was like water. The other items were sitting in the water like gravy and were inedible. Some one did not care enough to make this correctly.

I contacted the Corp office and  never herd back. I called the manager and they said they would replace the items but when I came back that manager was not there and they would not do anything.

I would be careful giving your money to this location. The food sucks not."}
{"text":"Today we decided to stop by the Glendale sports arena Carl's Jr. kind of overpriced on a lot of their menu items but it is the Glendale sports arena with the cardinal stadium next-door hello Westgate but the five dollar boxes still five dollars the All-Star mail beautiful place was clean people are friendly and the food was good and warm all of the budget under six dollars if I had to say so myself I would definitely do it again but Baja ha ha ha ha ha ha I always say so myself"}
{"text":"This has got to be the best looking carls jr ive ever ben to. Its new location close to the Coyotes and cardinals arena is super sweet for before and after events. This one in particular tastes super fresh and they usually seem to do a quick and good job on whatever I order. They are my go to carls for whenever I need my fix..  They are always quick even on game days. My only complaint is theres some guy with glasses (occasionally he doesnt wear them it seems) that gives my father a hard time about his military discount, thats insanely frustrating to him and myself, but we have called corporate and recieved compensation for his ignorance.. I love that carls overall tho, and wouldnt deny how awesome they are just because of that one D bag."}
{"text":"Rude ass manager or whatever she was. Me and my cousin walked in and she turned and said OUT LOUD \"still coming in?! Como chingan bro, ugh god\" and rolled her eyes l like wtf kind of customer service is that? if you didn't want anymore people coming in THEN LOCK THE DOOR! Or simply just say \"sorry we're closed\" Rude miserable ass lady. Pretty sure she was the manager Bc she had a black button up dress shirt. She had tattoos on her arms so if you're reading this, know that it's not my fault you hate your job. Do better, management.. other than that the guy at the register was pretty nice! :)"}
{"text":"Customer service was great. I feel bad for the employees they seem terribly understaffed and are all trying their best. Food was ok, the western bacon cheeseburger had way too much BBQ sauce.  Zero clean tables were available."}
{"text":"Boy was this a mistake, got in the drive thru line , which may of only had 6 cars in front of us. 
It took 30 minutes to get to the speakers to place our order. No one even said be with you in a minute. My husband finally asked if anyone was there and a person comes on and said YES, then we asked what was takingbso long and the voice said THINGS ARE A MESS ... there where cars behide us so we couldn't leave. So we place our order.
After another 25 minutes to get to the window to get our food. I decided to check the order because we got handed two drinks and we only ordered one. My hamburger was ordered without cheese.  We got it with cheese so we gave it back so they could make it right. For our trouble they did give us 3 cookies. 
I hope they get it together, because the worker was right IT WAS A MESS."}
{"text":"OMG I love that Super Bacon Cheeseburger.  I will be sorely dissapointed if this discontinues because it's a movie promotion burger or whatever.  I have eaten at various Carls Jr's several times in the last few weeks just to keep ordering this burger.  Might be the best fast food burger out there IMO."}
{"text":"In a span of 10 minutes I watched 4 workers go outside to smoke a cigarette. I stood inline for 5 minutes while workers chatted in the back doing whatever it is they do when they aren't working. Thankfully a car went through the drive thru so they had to actually work and saw me, otherwise I would have starved to death. Actually I would have just left. Terrible service, feel bad the owner pays these people."}
{"text":"Three stars for customer service and food, but gave them an extra star for having Supernatural playing on the tv. Yes it was after a convention, but still appreciate the gesture. 

When walking in we had to double take to make sure they were open. We could not see anyone at the register. After a short wait she popped out. Not friendly but not rude either. Just doing her job. 

Food was prepared promptly. Taste was usual for the restaurant. No complaintes. Wish they had diet caffeine free soda, but not many do.

Best part is there are TVs available all over the restaurant. There were two playing the show Supernatural. Yay! We were in a hurry to hit the road, but got to watch Sam and Dean!!!"}
{"text":"Uhhhhh not sure if this is Yelp's fault or Carl's Junior's fault. Hours say open til 2:00 AM on Yelp, so me and my husband drove all the way here since nothing else is open after 10 in Henderson (per Yelp \"open now\" filter).

No one here. Business closed. Thanks a lot for the waste in gas and time..."}
{"text":"I will have my husband go pick up some food yesterday and to say we were disappointed is an understatement this is by far the worst experience we have had the fries tasted so old and hard then my husband ordered the chili bacon fries and wow talk about super skimpy. Never going back to waste my money here."}
{"text":"They ignored me going to the drive-through. I tried several times getting their attention. It's like they don't care. The hamburgers are smashed. And everything is overcooked. Not sure though they're still in business"}
{"text":"The service here was fine.  The food came out faster than I remember in the past.

I think Carl's Jr food is something you have to acquire a taste for.  I never have."}
{"text":"This place is so crappy. Each and EVERY single time I COME HERE SOMETHING IS WRONG. EVERY SINGLE TIME. Me and my husband have actually bet about it being WRONG one time and,sure enough they were. Maybe they need to get some new microphones I don't know. I'm not happy with them."}
{"text":"Great building,  location,  access,  but lazy staff.  One guy working front and everyone else in back partying and texting on android phones. Super long wait. Ordered fries, the one guy working had to put it in... no one else had any food ready. the guy put a bag down waiting for the fries to get done, and a  woman from the back, picked it up, put her hand in it and spun it round and round on her hand... then moved it up and down...  what fun playing with her hand in the bag they loaded up my fries in...  I threw the bag and fries away. What a complete waste of money and time.  They should put a manager in there that understands business and hygiene in a food industry."}
{"text":"Slow service, but they are nice and the fries are hot...that's a good place to start."}
{"text":"Had their version of BK whopper and chocolate milkshake.  Had much better elsewhere.  Despite being late night with few customers, counter service was poor.  Won't go again unless no other hamburger place is available."}
{"text":"Meet Joe Bowers, the first subject for the army's top secret human hibernation experiment. When the trial run goes awry, this \"average Joe\" awakens in the year 2505 only to discover that he is the smartest person in the world, stuck with the dumbest people in history. Now it's up to him to get human evolution back on track!

I feel like Joe Bowers from the movie Idiocracy after reading some of these reviews. Carl Jr's is an iconic franchise in the year 2505 and does a lot more than sell burgers. But on to my review. I usually come into Carl Jr to relax and drink a soda. I was hooked on those $1 large sodas which are now a $1.50. Occasionally I'll order a Burger, fries and soda combo. I go for the higher end burger since the quality of the meat tends to be much better than the cheaper menu item. I had a chuckle when a reviewer was crying about her $13 dollar lunch. Well don't order a shake Sherlock. Or people who have been here several times and the orders are never right. Really? How many times are you going to punish yourself? That's why these reviews are not believable. I always special order my burgers with no order mix up. They had the Mexican burger for a limited time in the winter. I can't wait till they bring that one back.

So if I ever decide to join the army's top secret human hibernation experiment and find myself in the year 2505, I hope Carl Jr will remember my review and credit me with the modern currency so I can enjoy their burgers and sodas."}
{"text":"My co-worker was telling me that she enjoyed her lunch here recently so I decided to give it another try. You guys have stepped up your game. It looks like you got a new board and speaker system. I can actually hear the person trying to take my order and see what they've submitted. I got my other in a decent amount of time and the staff was pleasant. From my past experiences I can't really give you 5 stars but I can say whatever you guys are doing is working."}
{"text":"Not even worth 1 star! This location is SLOW!!!! I waited in a packed drive thru for a half an hour until I got my meal. I come here a few times a week and my order is usually wrong. It seems like the people that work here are more interested in having fun with each other then actually doing their job. After today I have made the decision ever to eat here again."}
{"text":"One of the worst salads 


Carl's Jr and I have always had an on again off again relationship based on their hit and miss quality of food.  I have had some great food at Carl's Jr and some of the absolute worst food a Carl's Jr.  Today, the absolute worst took on a whole new meaning. 



Two co-workers and I decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  So we headed to Carl's Jr for a salad.  I was really disappointed. We ordered the grilled chicken salad which consisted of wilted mixed greens, unripe tomato and chicken which was like pencil eraser pellets, didn't seem like real meat. I just could not bring myself to even eat one piece.   Not appetizing at all. I tried to pick out all the wilted green, unripe tomatoes, and unappetizing chicken. I thought okay things should be better. Now with the horrible chicken taste removed all that was left was cucumbers. Don't think I will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I usually like their burgers but got food poisoned   with my lunch meal yesterday, and still fighting it today after an horrible night ... Not happy about it to say the least  !!!"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning on 1/5/2015. I have not been here in a while...now I know why...the only reason I went back because I wanted to try the new \"All Natural Burger\" So I got it as a low carb option...which means no bun...I also got the Lo carb Jalapeno burger. 

First lets talk about price...All I got was the two burgers...NO drink...NO Fries...with no buns...so basically burgers wrapped in lettuce...$15.14...Rip OFF!!!!! 

Seriously for the price I paid I could of bought a head of lettuce, the meat and all the fixings and fed a family of 6. 

Secondly...this place is dirty...as I walked in, there were two Little Ceasers pizza boxes sitting on top of the bushes next to the Redbox dvd rental machines, along with a few empty drinking containers...and in general allot of trash. Once you get inside it's not much better. 

I made my order, seriously almost shit myself when the girl told me the price. Thinking this better be the best burger I have ever eaten. The girl gave me my little table number tent and I then proceeded to sit down...most of the tables were dirty...not sure how they can't keep up on this stuff it was 8:40pm...and besides me there were only 3 other people in the building, a couple and what appeared to be a homeless guy in the back maybe drinking coffee.

My food was brought out on a tray by a girl...first thing I noticed is my napkin dispenser at the table is empty, so I had to get up to get them at another table...and the tray she brought it to me on was warped...so it didn't sit on the table flat...seriously why wouldn't you throw this thing out?? 

Let's talk about taste...the all natural burger...literally looked like a piece of flattened grilled dog food, and was so greasy...I mean like literally left a puddle of grease in my hamburger box... and it tasted bad...like it may of possibly been bad...but I thought to myself...maybe it was just because it was all natural. I was wrong...let's just say...the last few days I have been sick to my stomach felt like I was getting stabbed with razor blades and I had the worst fever. I am sure this food was the cause, it was all I had eaten that day, and all I had except for an iced tea from Starbucks. 

I will never go back to this location. It's dirty on all accounts. Gross. Don't pay attention to the review below saying that this place is good, I honestly think that was written by someone that works there. So bad. 

DON'T EVER GO HERE...EVER...you could die from food poisoning!"}
{"text":"Always mess up my order...

Today ordered two of the sliders 5 dollar box... only one had a cookie... the other box was missing the cookie. I'm tired of paying for food and not receiving it and having to go back and get it... im not going back to get the cookie such a waste of gas ..and such an inconvenience... I'm gonna go to the one off boulder from now on..."}
{"text":"Not bad for a fast food restaurant - the burgers were best better than I thought, real meat and ingredients and you got to choose 3 different options for fries. Great place to chill and very clean with great staff, so worth it!"}
{"text":"Quick food pick up for daughter and her friends and the experience reminded me why I hate fast food.  Staff could care less about you or your order and it was clear they wished I never had walked in.  As I waited for my food, I watched numerous customers come in and wait for any staff to walk to their registers to take an order. Unacceptable in my opinion.  As for the food, items lacked any good flavor and were just plan not good. The only and I mean only bright spot was the building itself. It was loaded with televisions showing sporting events and everything appeared fairly new. If it was not for the building, I would give 0 stars. If only I could. $35 I can not get back. :( Should have driven farther to a Chickfila."}
{"text":"This location is almost acceptably clean. The men's rest room is nasty nasty nasty. The service is friendly and prompt. This was my first and last time here (mainly because I'm here only for business) but it may be my last visit to a Carl's period.  Don't be surprised to be confronted by meth heads or Trashy low life's asking for a handout. This part of town sucks."}
{"text":"Really cant believe the stupidity of the caliber of employees,  4 different Carls Jr. Managers from 2 stores. First store place order...order was discovered to be wrong NOT only the wrong burger, but absolutely plain several mins later after I left was on HWY....another Carls Jr. store on the way home I stop tell them the problem. NOW SAME OWNERS OF THESE LOCATIONS...I ASKED FIRST QUESTION... the store asst. managers both tell me NO they cant replace the burger from both stores...I have witnesses (a friend and 6 customers, 1 of whom left once she heard what was going on).....It gets better they both say they cant give away free food....and they dont want to get in trouble for it....MEANWHILE IM HEATED AND LAUGHING FROM THE STUPIDITY......Its was listen I paid for this shit $8.17 to be exact...your not giving me anything for free...Im looking for what I paid for...Meanwhile Now the Managers of each store is involved on phone and THEY REFUSED.......WTF REALLY IS WRONG WITH  YOUNG PEOPLE THESE DAYS...IS OUR YOUNGER GENERATION OF KIDS REALLY THIS DUMB!!  To FINISH I will be calling Corporate on both stores, the BBB, and emailing sites all over the internet."}
{"text":"Breakfast burger - sounds horrible, but it's not bad. I did skip the hash browns on the burger, that is a bridge too far for me. But a layer of scrambled eggs on a bacon burger - oh ya.

Staff was quite friendly and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Due to being rerouted by construction I have stopped here a couple of times for a quick snack.  Not really my favorite area of town but the food was prepared correctly and the place was clean.  The one time I used the restroom it was also clean."}
{"text":"This is the worst Carl's Jr I have ever been to!!!!!! Every time I use the drive thru they NEVER get my order right and always forget to add something. Then when you try to call the number doesn't work. This would really be a -star if I could give it!"}
{"text":"Just went to the Carls on boulder hwy and my god the lady in drive through was the rudest bitch I have ever seen in a fast food place.  Talked so fast and loud and when we ordered I was told no 3 times for items.  Not sorry just a no.   Wow but let me tell you Wendy's took our 2 orders and actually acted like they cared and we're polite.  I would say and jow am saying screw Carls jr. Many many more places to eat and be treated half way decent for spending money and god for bid they do what they are employed for."}
{"text":"Brand new location at the Westgate Mall area, adjacent to the Cardinal's stadium.  Location has all the latest and greatest Carls Jr innovations and is top notch.  The eating area has all the new age art deco feel and is very clean.  If you love burgers, this is the place.  The buns are freshly baked rolls, and currently Carls Jr is the only burger chain that still has 100% Angus burgers.  You must have the $6 Thickburger in any form is good, I prefer classic dress with lettuce, tomato, pickle, cheese, mayo, mustard and last but not least onion.  The choice of fries is great, you can do standard cut, waffle cut seasoned, potato fries or chili cheese fries.  The location could only be better if it had a Coke Freestlyle but it does not.  You can get a great selection of drinks though and they even sell Monster on site if you need to get your burger on then get all charged up.  The site has tons of great flat screens to check out ESPN while you eat, however the swag lights are kind of in the way of the TVs.  All and all a great burger experience."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru went to give my order and was CASH ONLY. Really ? Never have I have seen this in a fast food restraunt. I was stuck in the drive thru for ten minutes . Going to take my business elsewhere . Carl's Jr. you really need to get your head out of your butt."}
{"text":"In my life I've never encountered the degree of amateurism...or the lack of training and supervision as I did in this dump on May 18th.

Carl's Jr has a really good burger and that's what I felt like.  (NOTE: the best burger in Phoenix is STILL Lucky Boy, 16th St and Osborn) First It was the \"$6\" burger, now I think the same is called the All American...I ordered it, full meal and I changed the drink to an Oreo Cookie Shake.  All told: $13 plus change.  Now, name me a burger joint that I can't go to for $13!

So, I ordered inside and while I'm standing in the restaurant, waiting, and my burger comes up, put in a bag, and the counterhelp said, \"we're just waiting on the fries\".  Ok.  Now, perhaps she doesn't know the fries and burger are supposed to come up together, that being the difficult part of restauranting, but ok.  Now, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes go by, a woman I hadn't seen before calmly walks behind the line, drops some frozen fries into the fryer and walks away.  Hastily, I say to the counterhelp, \"those AREN'T my fries, right?\" thinking that mine were done...or should have been!

\"Oh yeah\" she said.  \"We're just waiting on the fries.\"  

\"NO!  That won't work.  I want my money back!\" I said.  I mean, whenever the fries would have been done, the burger was already not hot and would have been cold. 

Now, another worker I'd never seen before comes around and refunds my money.  

I called Carl's Jr Corporate the next day and gave them the details.  Now, 30 hours later, no word from local management which indicates to me that management is as ignorant or apathetic as the workers they failed to train or supervise.

What a waste of time!

P.S. Read my review of Burger Bar in Las Vegas.  This -- Carl's Jr on Thomas Rd -- is exactly the opposite.  Burger Bar-great.  Carl's Jr., not so much."}
{"text":"The sign says open till 2 one sundays I was here at 1230 and all I see is a guy in the lobby sweeping . Multiple cars went through the drive through some even honked. I understand if you guys are about to close but this was about an hour and a half before close  . Very poor night crew."}
{"text":"Horrible.. Famous star meal no cheese and hi c is what I asked for.. Came to the Window found out they had no hi c.. Came home found out they had extra cheese on my burger.. Never going again"}
{"text":"ever since i discovered Carls Jr ive been hooked.  i think Carls Jr is the ultimate big burger fast food franchise.  everything on their menu is good and they are open 24/7.  never had a bad experience with Carls Jr.  wish they had one here in Hawaii.  The Big Carl Meal all day every day."}
{"text":"I used the drive thru.  After waiting way too long, when I got up to the window, they didn't know what I ordered.  The woman tending the window very explicitly called to the cooks \"Is the Double Western ready\".  No it wasn't.  I finally got my order and drove home.  When I went to eat what they gave me, it was a single, not a double. I agree with most of the above reviews...  the workers don't do their job in a professional manner.  They need an experienced, professional manager that cares."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, morning staff was very quiet not very welcoming, but the restaurant was clean, food was okay not very hot!  Paid extra for criss-cut fries and received mixture of cool tater tots, regular fries and some criss-cut fries.  My son loved his Sante Fe chicken which was warm and tasty."}
{"text":"Best fast burger and awesome shakes! Everyone is so polite and professional and the place is clean! They should offer banquets because it's huge inside."}
{"text":"*****Update******* 05/23/2018

I wanted to grab something fast and easy and thought, Hmmmmm, Carl's Jr.? Why not, what could go wrong? There were already several vehicles in line and one pulled up quickly behind me. Once I arrived at the intercom to order, the woman at the drive thru explained that she could not hear me, so I spoke louder, she explained that she still could not here, after the 3rd time of her telling me she could not here me she tells me that I have to go into the restaurant to order. After about 10 minutes of sitting I was able to get to the window and tried to order there, but again she explained she could not here me face to face and I have to still go inside. 

Once inside, I asked Pedro how many pieces came with the chicken tenders, he looked at me confused, I asked how many chicken tenders can I order, he said 20 was the highest amount. He explained he did not understand the question, I then had to explain that I was not wearing my glasses or my contacts and wanted to know the amounts they offered, he said all the pieces are about the same size. I had to explain, some places come with a 3 pc, 6 pc, 9 pc, etc, finally he got it. I placed my order, asked what type of fries I can order, regular, curly, waffle? He took another 5 minutes for me to explain which option of fries were, finally he says OH we have waffle styled fries, I asked what dipping sauce choices do I and he points across the way and says they are there, I again explained that I did not have my glasses on (they were in the car) and he rolls his eyes and rambles what the choices were. I asked for BBQ and Buffalo. It takes about 15 minutes for my order, the chicken tenders were not fresh nor were the fries, and he brought Buttermilk Ranch. 

I have never worked at a fast food restaurant but I do not understand how difficult it is to actually take orders."}
{"text":"Poor Customer service from the beginning. Did not enter the coupon correctly. Dirty tables. Sad because it's a brand new venue. Staff needs better training and management."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant unless you enjoy waiting 5 .minutes to be acknowledged and then it is only to tell you to wait.... This is with no customers waiting"}
{"text":"First time at this hamburger chain .Wow what a menu! 
  Was greeted as i walked in great staff kind patient place,
 was immaculate. The food was done just right and fast before transaction. Was done a server handed me my order they really put the fast in fast food. Great place to get food before the movies."}
{"text":"Um, no.  I need to quit eating fast food anyway, but...ugh.  I just moved out west and had never eaten at a Carl's Jr.  Won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"I would give a 1 star but I don't like doing that. The employees were semi-nice, but don't go out of their way. But seriously if I have to wait 15 minutes for my food I am not going to be happy. The guy in front of me waited for 1 cheeseburger for 17 minutes. They are not even busy?? I don't get it. How about you hire more than 2 employees to get you through an evening. It's highly annoying! It is always like this at this location, so don't be surprised if you have to wait a half hour to get your food. Your better off going to a sit down place. Also, if you ordered your food to go, make sure you check the bag before you go. They will always forget your fries."}
{"text":"Sign on the door says they serve breakfast till 11AM on the weekends.  We get there at 10:30am and they say they are done doing breakfast!!! We ask why and they say \"breakfasts shortage\".   WTF is that?!?!?  Change the sign then or put up a new sign. Someone from corporate should look into this place.   It felt more like they just didn't want to make it!"}

I said I would wait for fresh, next order was the same way.  I drove around and went in asked the girl to take a look and a taste.  She did she responded those are overlooked.  Well yes because the have them in a waiting pattern and when they are ordered they put them back down.  The cook was muttering something in Spanish and the other lady put some new ones down.  This store is never busy why don't they understand people would rather wait for fresh and hot.
The new rings look completely different and we're good.  They had 5 orders of fries holding and no one was there.  In line or in the store.  I can only guess when the next customer orders fries what they are going to be like."}
{"text":"The place smells like an old trailer and there were multiple hairs in my chicken fingers. Ew."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I went through the drive through and no one answered. I sat there for three minutes asking if anyone was there. I then proceeded to leave and found a line of cars where it looked like people were giving their orders at the window. For three cars, I sat in the drive through for 30 minutes. Unreal."}
{"text":"Waited for 35 minutes for my food and asked for a refund and the manager kept looking at me like I was stupid. She hardly spoke English and I asked her for the phone number to the corporate office and didn't know where it was when she was the manager. After awhile she finally gave me my refund and won't ever be back to this location. Seems like all the managers around here have their heads up their asses!!!!"}
{"text":"I checked on yelp if Carls Jr was open Thanksgiving & it said yes. Came to the drive thru and some one told me to look over the menu and let them know when I was ready to order. I waited... And waited. They never came back. Lights were on inside but 10 min later no one came back. Drove up to the actual window, no one there. RUDE!!!! Don't say you will be open if you don't have workers that are going to actually work."}
{"text":"You know this place has gotten me sick twice in a week. I didn't want to say anything the first time because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. But after today, this place needs to get the management to do something drastic or the right person is going to the city to complain. First my chicken sandwich was hard (like freezer burn then they tried to fry it), then my wife's chicken club was cut into pieces (not the sandwich but the actual chicken).  The fries were so soggy that when we came back to show them through the drive thru he just took them and replaced them with small fries, which wasn't our size. The sandwich wasn't noticed until we got home. So disappointed.  Will go to the one on Sunset now."}
{"text":"I always come here at least 1once a week and get the same thing every time.1/2 lb Guacamole Bacon Thickburger Large size."}
{"text":"This Carls Jr sucks royally! 

The cashiers were MIA for several minutes. Finally some dopey looking girl came out and asked me what I wanted. I placed my order. She nodded, typing it into the machine. Then she looks up at me again with that dopey expression. She clumsily hands me one of those plastic numbers and a cup. 


I'm not sure if she was stoned or mentally challenged or whatever. I got my drink and sat down, making sure I placed the number where it could be seen. I waited...and waited. finally another cashier wandered over and timidly asked me if I'd been helped yet. I replied yes and handed her my receipt. She apologized and went to inform the cook.

Another ten minutes later I get my food and by then my appetite is gone. But I ate anyway. meanwhile some drunk guy gets up from the back and starts bugging people for money. It took the staff ten minutes to remove him.

Don't go to this one unless you are starving to death."}
{"text":"I think I'm finally giving up fast food ! I actually like carls jr over all fast food chains but I'm not liking the thin creepy looking patties. I ordered the all natural burger combo: fries were barely warm, burger greasy and after taking a look at it upon removing the bun...I couldn't bring myself to eat it so can't really peak on taste. Only got stars due to fond carls jr memories,   pleasant drive through staff and bc I can say burger looks appetizing until you actually take a look between the buns :("}
{"text":"Help me, I'm addicted to Carl's Jr chicken tenders and fries :("}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would this HAS to be the worst Carl's Jr known to man. 
 I got here at 430 I had to come back TWICE b3cause my burger the first time had onion I'm allergic! The second time it was just meat with no lettuce or tomatoes meanwhile, my fries are cold as shit it is now 4:55. The manager sucks the cashier sucks and so does the cook. Not to mention the cook laughed when I mentioned I was allergic to onions. The sweet tea at the fountain station is awful. It's the most disgusting thing ever"}
{"text":"I went here on my birthday. Had a coupon for buy one get one free TURKEY teriyaki burgers. Was rudely cut off while making order. What I received was teriyaki hamburgers.  They made me and a friend feel sick that night. Was told that I'd get a call back and my money. Never got a refund or call back. Complained to the Better Business Bureau and they never responded. Go else where for better food and service."}
