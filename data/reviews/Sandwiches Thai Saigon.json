{"text":"Thai Saigon is located in the neighbourhood of ahuntsic in the north east of Montreal. Regardless , it is very accessible by car or public transit as the restaurant is located right beside the metro cremazie and the 40 highway.

Anywho , service is courteous and very fast . The restaurant itself is not very big but can easily accommodate 10-15 people.
Indeed , they are very busy with takeout and delivery orders.  It is family owned and it will give you a real warmth of traditional home made Vietnamese cuisine. Nonetheless, my standards when it comes to Vietnamese meals as I have been eating this typical food for years as well as I had the opportunity to experience Vietnamese cuisine in Vietnam , LA, north cal , and Vancouver. I can say with confidence that Thai Saigon is an excellent Vietnamese restaurant as I couldn't believe how good some of their food is . For example , my favourite is their Thai Sandwich which I take on a weekly basis , it is very big , affordable and fills up one's hunger in no time . Thai Saigon differs from other restaurant as they attempt to cook the meat evenly and the least MSGs as possible . Their menu offers a vast choice of food , from Vietnamese to traditional popular Asian choices such as the chow mein or the general Tao chicken.

As a result , I do recommend thai Saigon as it offers a great selection of dishes at a very affordable prices(between 4$ for a sandwich to 12$ for a meal --combo are ~15$) .  I also believe that having such a small restaurant offers it's own charm if one wants to eat alone or with another friend as it is pretty quiet and you can easily have a conversation :)

Lastly, don't forget they offer take out orders and delivery to many areas close to their neighbourhood. 

Enjoy these Vietnamese dishes fellow Yelpers :)"}

{"text":"A tiny hole in the wall with an odd layout.

Satisfying food with huge portions at an attractive price.

I was quite hungry so I got a Thai sandwich. (pork, beef and cbicken) a real steal at $4.

I also got a chicken pad Thai which came with a crispy imperial roll (awesome flavor).

The pad Thai was a bit to cloying for my liking.
The chicken breast atop it was generous but lacked an amazing taste.

I unfortunately heard the beeping microwave a couple of times wish is always unfortunate in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Very average place. Quite and cozy. Lunch was 13.50$ plus tip. They take credit card for anything over 10$. The portion was middle sized and the taste wasn't memorable. The chicken was all dark meat if that effects things for some.

The staff was friendly and efficient. I may go back if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Because they are fast, good , easy , few tables, nice service. Just i wish the decoration more fancy... but little urbain terrasse available."}
