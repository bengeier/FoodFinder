{"text":"Quick, cheap eats for Trini style roti and doubles. Have a couple locations within GTA. I usually ask for extra tamarind sauce for the doubles and pouloris."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time last night. Counter staff was giving another customer their order. Then staff member looked at my wife and I and went back into the kitchen. We were the only customers. Staff never came out. Two more customers came in separately after us. Still, staff never came out. We waited nearly ten minutes. Never saw staff again. We left. And we are never going back."}
{"text":"I had chicken and Roti at this place after my friends recommendation. I liked the chicken very much over the lamb. But their doubles is a must eat food item. Affordable prices."}
{"text":"Small hole in the wall restaurant. I've only ever ordered takeout (roti and doubles) but they have been really good. Both times I've been the place has been packed with people sitting in for their buffet."}
{"text":"Great food. I had a boneless chicken roti and it was delicious, not greasy and spiced to perfection. The place is not as tidy as it could be, but the did makes up for it."}
{"text":"Go to this place if you want to wait for more than 45 minutes just to get your food. Went here today at around 12.45 pm and waited until 1.30 pm and still no sign of my food being ready. It was for a take out order and I ordered their Jerk Chicken with rice and peas mini. Paid for it at the cashier and the girl was sweet but completely clueless as to what was going on. I understand that she is new but as owners you got to make sure that she is at least trained properly to use the POS system. I had 3 different people including the owner who came out from the kitchen asking me what my order was and if I had a receipt to my order. Sure I'd have one if the girl gave me one! And it was not even a complicated order. Just jerk chicken, rice and peas for god's sake! I eventually asked for a refund as my lunch time was almost over no thanks to these guys. Kinda sad though as I was looking forward to trying their food but ended up at the McD's beside them for my lunch option.

And oh yeah pre-ordering through the phone does not make a difference either. Some other people were waiting for their food too. Completely and utterly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I put this place up there with \"Taste of T&T\".
Very affordable and tasty!
I got a mini boneless Goat roti and two doubles with extra hot pepper. A nice filling meal for under $8 dollars. I go here often"}
