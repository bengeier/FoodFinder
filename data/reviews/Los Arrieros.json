{"text":"We'd walked by this tiny little restaurant a bunch of times and every time we walked by at night it was full of people who looked like they were really enjoying themselves.  So, we thought, \"hey we like to enjoy ourselves and we like to eat, let's try it out\".  We are pumped that we did.  The menu is full of Colombian and Mexican food.  We had burritos and chimichangas and they were awesome.  Super tasty and fresh.  The salsa was also amazing.  The restaurant also has an authentic vibe and the server was super friendly.  Totally going back."}
{"text":"Sometimes a huge plate of meat is just a huge plate of meat. 

An intrepid group of Yelpers, myself included, trekked out to this interesting looking venue last night in the hopes of finding Toronto's best kept South American secret. I'm sorry to say that, based on my experience, there is no secret. 

Concurrent with some other reviews, the serving sizes are indeed impressive, however, I did not find much of substance or flavour in them. 

The best thing I ordered was my passionfruit margarita. It was too thick to \"drink\" for a long time and had huge chunks of ice in it but it was delicious.

I ordered the platano con queso (fried plantain with cheese) for an appetizer. To tell the truth I didn't really know what this was going to look like. My impression, based on previous experience with fried plantain, was it it would be pieces of the unripe starchy plaintain friend to a golden crisp with some kind of queso blanco. What arrived was more akin to a fried banana split filled with melted cheese. The plantain was fairly ripe, and therefore both sweet and mushy, not crispy at all. I found the dish to be quite flavourless.

For my main I ordered the Chuleta de Cerdo Apanada, which I now know is a fried, breaded pork cutlet. There were two huge cutlets on my plate. a salad of iceberg lettuce with what I can only assume was Kraft zesty Italian dressing and a serving of plain white rice. Although the cutlets were perfectly cooked, there was no flavour to be found on the plate. Luckily, I asked our server for some hot sauce and she brought out a house made salsa piquante which was perfect for both adding flavour and heat to my cutlets. 

The venue is quaintly decorated in all kinds of gaudy, eclectic paraphernalia. The service could be better. No water was offered and the food seemed to arrive in a very staggered manner. Our server was very friendly and accommodating when she was at the table. 

I think, if I return, I might try the Mexican options over the traditional Columbian options in the hopes of encountering more flavourful food."}
{"text":"Good restaurant and nice alternative in the area. I had driven and walked by this place many times, hesitant to stop in as it's rather small and on an unattractive stretch of Jane. Well, I'm glad a friend convinced me to dine there yesterday. Really good food in large potions and super friendly service.

This family-owned and run restaurant is rather small, and waits are possible on a Friday or Saturday evening. But it's worth a visit. I'll certainly go back there."}
{"text":"Went back again yesterday for lunch. The secret here is ordering right. We had the tamales plate (actually just one, but huge, and a bit bland), which I don't recommend, particularly, and then the most delicious thing I've had in a while... the chicken breast cooked with a sauce made of chipotle, sour cream, and tequila. The sauce was fantastic - so yummy that I mopped it up with everything else on the plate, including the salad (which comes with dressing conveniently on the side). I'm still a huge fan."}
{"text":"Amazing, authentic food, friendly service. Really cannot ask for more! We had the fish tacos and chuletta con arroz - my boyfriend spent several months in Miami and said it surpassed his experience down there. Absolutely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This is a good neighbourhood spot. They seem to be promoting their Mexican food lately, but this is really a simple Columbian place. Steak, beans, rice, plantains etc. The traditional plates are the best. Pork cutlet breaded and fried or the bandeja paisa (steak, pork belly, fried egg, rice, plantains) are the stars for me. They don't do chips and salsa. They don't do guacamole. They don't do margaritas. They do simple, solid food and don't charge a ridiculous amount. It's not cheap by any stretch, but what is in this city."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with G and each time, everything seems to get worse and worse. Food, service, coffee. Worse.

The first time we went, it was pretty good. The food portions are egregiously huge and once you get past that, the actual quality of food is mediocre. We used to take whatever was left home with us. The last time we went for lunch, we left whatever was on our plates and took nothing home. 

Usually we start off with some beef empanadas which are usually pretty flavourful but for some reason, they were slightly bland and we had to douse them with the homemade hot salsa (which is actually pretty flavourful). We got the chips and guacamole for apps and the chips were decent but the guac was bland. We actually mixed the salsa in with the guac to give it some life. 

G got his usual lemon chicken (chicken breast smothered in cheese and lemon sauce) and I got a meat platter of sorts (skirt steak, sausage, and some sort of pork bacon). G was pretty happy about his food... I can't say the same for mine. The steak was cooked well but the sausage was dry and bland and the bacon was tough and dry, like it had been cooked and sitting around for more than a few days. 

We had the meal with complimentary Colombian coffee. The first round was good but the cups were only filled about 2/3 of the way high. G asked for a second cup and while it was filled slightly higher this time, it tasted like the dregs at the bottom of the coffee maker. Seriously, burnt gross coffee. 

The service? Slow and indifferent.

I think it's going to be a while before we go back to El Arriero again. This used to be one of our go-to spots for latin food, not so much anymore."}
{"text":"Awesome food that's gotten even better.  Not fancy (picnic tables for seatings).  Good honest food.  Seems like most of the patrons are spanish speaking."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere, though loses a star for size, furniture and no al... I even took my (Eastern European) mom here once and she really really liked it! 
I always look forward to going back, GREAT deal on their empanadas!"}
{"text":"A great place to go if you're looking for true Latin American food. Reminded me of the amazing foods I tasted while backpacking through Central America not long ago!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem in the BWV neighbourhood this past month - according to the server it's been around for 10 years!  I'm generally hesitant about trying these kind of smaller establishments, but boy am I glad I ever did.  I've been back again this month and each time the servers are amazingly friendly, the atmosphere fun and has authentic Mexican and Colombian dishes.

The drinks are delicious - I've had a strawberry daiquiri and sangria - and although the food hasn't been to my taste both times, I am definitely going back to sample more on their menu.  The first visit I got a Colombian dish recommended by a fellow Yelper.   The second visit I got flautas which are hard corn tortillas - unfortunately I like soft corn tortillas - my bad I should have asked.  The food isn't the cheapest, but the price of the drinks more than makes up for it.

Definitely worth checking out if you want a place that has more character (and is much more lively) than the run of the mill fare on Bloor St."}
{"text":"I've been here many times.  I usually choose the 'Bandeja Paisa' or some Colombian empanadas.  These are always tasty, but I'm sure there are more dishes that are delicious. 

The bandeja has rice, beans, a slice of beef, pork, plantain, avocado, tortilla and 1 egg.  The rice and the beans I find do most of the filling.  In my opinion, there should be less rice, and more beef, plantain, egg and tortilla.  Oh well.  Its $18 for a plate.  A bit on the high end for what you get, so I don't frequent this restaurant very much.   If you ask for a coffee, there are no refills included.  Shame, as most places will give offer you at least one free refill.   I understand if there are no refills on the specialty drinks, but there should be at least 1 refill included for coffee and standard soda.  In all, 3 stars becuase of the tasty food, but they could do so much better.

{"text":"Awesome food. Great ambience. Been going for years with my family. Love this place. I totally recommend this restaurant if you're in the Bloor West neighborhood."}
{"text":"No frills, real deal, server's-first-language-is-for-sure-Spanish kinda place. Picnic table seating, traditional Colombian decor, spelling mistakes on the  bleached-out laminated menu...you get the picture. 

If none of that turns you off, then there is great food to be had at Arrieros. Fresh soft shell tacos with fish, beef or Al Pastor are all great. Home-made chips, salsa and guacamole are the real deal. Imported \"Colombiana\" soda (kinda like Coca Cola) and charming staff are all part of what make this local hole-in-the-wall worth checking out. 

I will say that food here is a little pricey for what you get but still somewhere I'd keep visiting once in a while."}
{"text":"Authentic Colombian food that is tasty, in huge portions and comes with free coffee after meal! Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that doesn't look all that great or appealing from the outside, but it always had a decent amount of people inside so I decided to try it out. It was worth it. Really authentic Colombian food, nothing fancy, just good, tasty food. Portions are big. The interior is very eclectic but fun. Small space, not a lot of tables. Ask your server for a recommendation from the menu. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Looooove this place but it's too bad \"Colombian\" is misspelled on your lovely new sign... Kind of conflicts with the \"authentic\" part. I'd make whoever made it fix it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Colombian restaurant! The portions are definitely large enough to share, and very delicious. We had a platter of rice and beans with three types of meat, fried plantain, avocado and an egg on top! It was $20, but way more food than we could eat! And so good! And the empanadas with hot sauce are unreal! They're crispy and come to the table piping hot. REALLY good!

They've got tons of small Colombian souvenirs and trinkets on the walls that make for a really fun dining experience. They've even got a Mexican section on the menu (which is a bit odd), and we noticed many other diners had ordered from it, and their food looked really great too. Planning to try the Mexican nachos next time... You get a free Colombian coffee after your meal, and it's a really good cuppa coffee... I highly recommend this little gem. It's cozy, yummy, and the service is always very good."}
{"text":"I hate to give anything less than a 3 to a small business, but the food that I had wasn't very good.

First, atmosphere and service was quaint and friendly.  No complaints there!

Food, however, ranged from not good-I've had better.  Something in the nachos ($16) was 'off' (not fresh, going bad), most likely, it was the ground beef.  Lettuce in the nachos were kinda weird.  It really needed some other kind of sauce 'cause it was dry. 

Tamal ($9) - Portion was quite large, came with a side salad, & plantains.  Tamal itself was ok, I've had better elsewhere, but no real corn taste which is what I was expecting.  

My friend also ordered a tamal, but 15-20mins after my portion arrived, she was told that mine was the last one.  This was after the server said, \"Don't worry, your dish is coming soon!\"  So that was a disappointment, luckily, serving was enough for 2ppl, so I just shared my portion. 

Other friend ordered the Azteca Soup ($8) and she said it was good.  I never tried it.

I'm not opposed to going back, but I think the meat+rice or +fries (~$18-20) options are the ONLY way to go here.  That's what most of the Colombian people were ordering.  I wouldn't order the Mexican dishes 'cause I thought they were overpriced, e.g. $18 for chimichanga/burrito.  Definitely do not go for the nachos, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow, I love this place! The homemade hot sauce is soooo good. I always order empanadas as an appetizer.
I always order one of the columbian dishes (like bandeja paisa) since it's what I had the first time I went and lived it."}
{"text":"Just such a gem. Small, intimate, parrot themed, it's a special place. The food is exceptionally good here. Among the best ceviche i've had in Toronto, for only $13 I think. The plates are ginormous, so bring your appetite and make sure you bring a friend. Menu wise, you're talking lots of protein, beans and avo. 

Tip: There's a secret bar downstairs, which i'm assuming doesn't get used much in the winter. Could be an off-the-beaten-track-spot to throw a party."}
{"text":"Fun little Colombian restaurant. The atmosphere is very kitschy, lots of knick knacks all over the place and the tables are picnic benches. The clientele appears to be half Colombian have white. Worth checking out but the food, while good, isn't out of this world and prices are a little high.

They have really great juice ($2.50) in a variety of flavours from standards like mango to the more obscure like Lulo (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulo), which is my favourite. To start we had two types of plantains, arepa with cheese, empanada, and battered yuca fries. The yuca fries were the highlight and the empanada is the only one I wouldn't get again.

For mains we shared a tamale and the Bandeja Paisa. The tamale was decent and quite big. The Bandeja Paisa is a massive plate of rice, beans, avocado, plantain, egg, arepa, and three types of meat: sausage, beef, and chicharron (think chunky, fatty Spanish bacon). This thing is massive and contains a ton of meat. It's pretty good but there's not a huge amount of flavour going on.

For dessert we had two types of flan: caramel and coconut. Both really good but the coconut was amazing.

The staff messed up our order 2-3 times. No big deal and quickly fixed but worth mentioning.

Finally, I found the prices to be a little high for this calibre of food. It's pretty basic stuff without any frills and it came out to $25 per person including a couple juices. Not bank-breaking, but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Wow! This looks like a little fast food place from the outside, but go inside have a seat and prepare to experience some of the best Latin food You have had. The home made hot sauce is to die for. We started with the empanadas. Fantastic filling! Delicious! Our main meal consisted of Churrasco done to perfection. It was very tender and flavourful. Lots of butter didn't hurt. The tamal was also delicious, the pineapple in the filling was very subtle and the guacamole fresh and tasty. Well back to the Tecate! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for a few years now and really like the food. They had a bit of a problem for a while with the tamales, but I hear they are back to being good now. 
The stuff I have tried and liked, in order of improper spelling are:
Tamales - yum
Empanadas - tripple yum - don't leave without eating these
Guava juice with milk
Mini paisa - this is anything but mini and the full size paisa will fill two people with a little left over
Tongue - really good
Fish in salsa - also really good
The last two have non english names .....but I do not remember what they are now. 
They serve free columbian coffee at the end which I'm sure the coffee drinkers around just love!
They have some rather odd opening hours, so call before going."}
{"text":"amazing good colombian and latin american food"}
{"text":"We were a group of 10 & it was unanimous that we would come back again.

Our dinners varied from beef tongue, shrimp in rice, chicken, beef tacos, chicken tacos (not pictured) & meat appetizer platter (not pictured). Good portions, as you can see and all tasted great. 

Its super casual with picnic tables in a small and intimate space. 

Tried calling to reserve but the answering machine was generic (does not mention restaurant name) - and they did not receive our message.  Good thing they had room for us!"}
