{"text":"The food was good, but the customer service was horrible. When one of the guys came to take our drink order, everyone ordered water. I can assure you, no one mistakenly ordered a coke. Everything was going good until they brought back our drinks. Instead of everyone having water, they replaced one with coke. This wasn't really a big deal until we told the lady who gave us the coke that no one ordered that. She then went to go get our water and brought it back, telling us this, \"So my husband said that one of you ordered a coke...it's okay if you changed your mind!\" We never changed our mind and I'm 100% sure everyone ordered water. After that, she was incredibly unfriendly to us. Later on, as soon as the last person finished ordering their food, she stayed quiet and didn't even smile. She just grabbed the menu out of her hand and walked off. I don't even think she smiled once during the whole time of talking to us. The staff were very unwelcoming to us and I definitely will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"I have been going to Chen's for a really long time and I am in love with the Teriyaki chicken. It is the best in the valley. The service is really quick and maybe not super warm and welcoming but it's not usually uncomfortable. The last time I went though I felt super rushed. My sister and I were on that side of town and arrived at about 8:40 and they close at 9:30. As we're sitting down to eat the man that sat us told us at least 3 times that that was when they closed. I got it the first time, and you continuing to say it makes me want to just go somewhere else so we aren't bothering you, even though there is almost an hour before you close. Put me off a little, but the food was still good and hot, and the cup of soup always makes me happy. My only piece of advice is to not say anything about closing time until it's about 15 mins before you close. I am there to give you business, so don't make me feel like a nuisance."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous, we were trying to place an order to go and the lady on the phone was incredibly rude to us. She also hung up on us mid order, then called us back about 20 minutes later saying the part of what we had ordered was ready. We told them never mind because they were rude to us and they weren't even sincere with their apology. I've been here before and the food is not that great. We won't be back. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you want rude service."}
{"text":"Very happy with chens, their general tso chicken is awesome and the Korean soup is also very good. Great fried rice and the food always tastes fresh. Only bummer is they stopped making home made spring rolls but the egg rolls are still homemade and good. Chinese food places can be a hit or miss just lucky enough to live next to a good one"}
{"text":"My first and last time.  Not much flavor in the food.  Fried rice was soggy and hot and sour soup was weak on all accounts"}
{"text":"We've been here about a year and tried this place right away. The people were not very friendly and the food was so so. Decided to try it again last night and nothing changed, the service wasn't great, the spring rolls weren't good and the Mongolian beef was pretty much beefless and no taste this is one of the few Chinese places I've seen that the meals didn't come a soup. I don't think I'll fine here again anytime soon. You get the same thing at panda express"}
{"text":"BE VERY CAREFUL, if you order take out and they give you wrong item, they will not refund or give you replacement!  Food, vegtables in particular are often undercooked."}
{"text":"For the last year I have been addicted to their pan fried noodle dish!! Freshly prepared, generous portions, excellent service.  I'm am very pleased to live close by!"}
{"text":"the only reason we even go there is that it's close. food court cuisine, but fair prices and good service. It's okay if you're just craving chinese, just don't expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"This place is great! Wonderful service and the best Chinese food in the Valley. Huge servings for great prices. Try the spring rolls and the teriyaki chicken! They're my favorite."}
{"text":"Chens is excellent!  It has the combination of great food, service, and low price.  They have $6.95 lunch combos that includes your choice of many entrees, an eggroll, fried rice or noodles, a small bowl of soup and a small salad.  Wow!  The flavor is always very good, and they even will cook it to order (I always get the orange chicken cooked a little longer).  So, I didn't hesitate when my family went to a mexican food place down the street that always closes early, and my husband didn't want to run in last minute.  We ordered dinner for three (my husband, myself, and my adult daughter).  We were the only people in the place, and the lights were turned down low.  However, they turned everything back up, and served us promptly.  I found that the family meal was too much food for three and was under $35!  We ended up taking some of all three entrees home.  The taste was excellent for the Beef Broccoli, the Moo Goo Gai Pan, and the Chicken Lo Mein!  Wow!"}
{"text":"Pretty average production-like faire. The fried rice is boring and the food is kind if salty. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Very greasy and tasteless food. The orange chicken and the sesame chicken tasted the same. It had no flavor or very little sauce. Just tasted like heavily battered tasteless chicken. They did give huge portions and packaged it to go very well."}
{"text":"I called in an order with a rude person on the phone...if you don't want to talk on the phone then don't answer!  I went to pick up my food, which was awful, the woman at the register was completely unfriendly...rushed me and couldn't even break a smile?!  I just moved here and this place is around the corner but I will never be back or contribute to there business.  Should be shut down for lack of customer service!"}
{"text":"Boring, boring, boring.  Even the supposedly spicy dishes were bland and not at all spicy.  I would give it less than 1 star if I could."}
{"text":"I've got to believe the bad reviews are for the Chen's at Riggs & McQueen...and we would agree with those 1 and 2 star reviews.  The Chen's at Riggs and Gilbert (2945 E. Riggs) is actually really good and is not related to the other Chen's at 990 E. Riggs.  We ordered the pot stickers, egg rolls, lettuce wraps and fried shrimp appetizers and the pineapple chicken and mongolian beef entrees...and loved everything!  The chicken lettuce wraps were our favorite, especially since many Chinese restaurants don't even serve them for some unknown reason.  Don't confuse the Chen's restaurants...they're vastly different.  This one is worth trying!"}
{"text":"Both locations are bad with regards to food quality.  If you need an overdose of sodium I highly recommend it.   Service has always been good though.  But, food quality always sways us.  Sorry chen's."}
{"text":"Some of the locals love this place, but I'm not that much of a fan to be honest. It's got a hole-in the-wall kind of feel, but the food is not hole-in-wall good or great...kind of disappointing. Anyway, portions are large and the service is nice, just don't expect much more than that."}
{"text":"A hearty \"not bad\". Not a place you'd bring out of town guests but very adequate for neighborhood fare. Service was very good and they may improve the food with time. Big portions and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I just can't express how horrible this food is. I spent $50 and took 3 bites and ended up giving the food to a homeless man because I didn't have the heart to throw it out after paying that kind of money.   The General Tso's Chicken didn't resemble the typical dish. It looked more like puffed chicken that's used in sweet and sour chicken. There was no sauce on it!!! The Walnut shrimp looked oddly white. The noodles had a horrible flavor.    Don't waste your money.   This has to be the worse Chinese food I've ever had.  Never ever again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is fresh and good! This place is good for dinner and takeout, normally get takeout from here :)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years and this place never disappoints. It's cheap, the lunch specials are wonderfully priced, and it's just a great place to go to when you want some comfort food."}
{"text":"Chen's is 'aight.  If you're looking for basic Americanized Chinese food this far south of the Valley, then Chen's won't steer you wrong.  The lunch specials are the way to go at roughly $5 bucks a pop.  They give you soup but no choice, just egg drop.  They also give you a salad which I'm not very fond of.  The ranch they use tastes funny to me, maybe like it needs less mayonnaise and more spices.  Everyone seems to enjoy the salad though, so it could just be me.  I'll usually have Sesame Chicken or Orange Chicken or General Chicken.  Basic stuff as the menu doesn't offer much beyond this fare.  Another thing I've found peculiar is that they seem to use the same vegetables in most every dish.  It's almost like they just switch up the sauces and meats.   But all in all, I keep coming back here because of the proximity to my workplace and the limited options of other Asian places around.  Between Chen's and Asian Grill in Sun Lakes, I'd go with Asian Grill.  But Asian Grill is like a hideout for me and all of my other co-workers crowd Chen's up on a daily basis.  It's still pretty decent, though."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4pm so just missed lunch prices.  I ordered Beef with Pea Pods.  The Beef was very tender and the veggies were crisp - that's the only good I have to say.  For $10 got white rice and Beef and a fortune cookie.  No tea, no roll, nothing else.  Definitely not worth it.  And whatever you do, don't use the soy sauce.  Nothing but pure salt.  It was horrid.  And not speaky much English either.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This Chinese food was Delicious! We ordered Mongolian beef, Grneral Tso's chicken, chicken Lo Mein and chicken fried rice. Everything was tasty. Had a lot of food for great cost."}
{"text":"Riggs and McQueen ... Gosh, the last few previous reviews are confusing...I've eaten here, along with family, in the last 6 months, and have always had good service & food. I always have ordered the chicken with veggies. My mother has ordered the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce, and tonight, she tried the Honey Walnut Shrimp...that was amazing!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the review on the watery sweet n sour sauce. Not sure but I've never had it as runny as it is here. Makes me wonder if they water it down. Besides that it is ok but for cheaper, good food go to Chen's (formerly Big Wa) 2 miles away on Mcqueen and Riggs."}
{"text":"We've eaten here two times now and we really like it. I love the General Tso's chicken but now I like the orange chicken MORE... It was super tender white meat chicken and not over powered on the orange flavor. If you eat inside, you'll get great service by folks who are super attentive to drink refills, etc. Also, eat in house for dinner and you'll get egg drop soup with each main dish you order. Overall a great value, friendly service, and tasty food."}
{"text":"This is our new go-to place to satisfy cravings for Chinese food, and we've eaten at several since moving to this side of town two years ago.  The menu has the usual fare, but how it's prepared is fresh, crisp and light.  From vegetables to the crab puffs, everything we've tried over about six visits has been noticeably better than other places.  Even the tiny corn-on-the-cobb-y things are crisp and delicious!  I thought I was just imagining the difference in their preparation on our first visit (you know, being extra-hungry or something), but we've enjoyed every meal we've had here - usually grabbing take-out on our way home from the golf course!  Service is always friendly and fast.  After ordering and a quick stop in their very clean restrooms, hubby & I chatted about our round of golf for only a minute or two before our order was presented in neatly packed no-spill box to take home.  Though the restaurant is small, the tables and booths look nice and comfortable.  There were several tables with folks enjoying their meals.  (Empty restaurants always frighten me!)  We'll continue to make this our go-to place for a healthy, fresh & delicious after-golf meal!"}
{"text":"Good food, fair prices. Mongolian beef is awesome. So are the crab puffs. Not the very best, but good for the value and convenience."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews before eating here. The host that met me for my take out order was very nice and the food was ready quickly as promised but it was very bland and a little strange. My wife ordered the Garlic Chicken, while it appeared to be cooked it was very odd in appearance, like a unnatural white so she ended up not eating it. I ordered the Wok Fried Chicken which was tough and far heavier on fried then chicken but in this case that was probably a good thing. Thinking the fried rice would be the safe option we ended up having to remove all the chicken from the rice before we were comfortable eating it. Unfortunately it won't be on my list for a return it. I would give it one star but will give it two for friendly staff and quick service but for no other reason."}
{"text":"The food is great.... Service is another story. Have ordered here several times and they do not deliver but then have the nerve to call over and over and over if you aren't there within 10 minutes! Anyone who lives in the area knows it takes time to drive somewhere in this area. I could understand if we weren't regulars or had previously ordered and never showed up, but to call 3 times within 20 minutes and then threaten that next time we have to pay first just because we are late is ridiculous! You close at 9:30 pm and it's 5:30! Will now be looking for another Chinese food place even if I have to drive farther away."}
{"text":"I had forgetten about Chen's and happened to be driving by today, so I stopped in for lunch.  Decided to dine in...the atmosphere is very clean and it was fairly quiet.  I was surprised to see that the lunch combos are still only $4.95, it's really a bargain for the quality of food.    As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I eat a lot of asian food and, therefore, am always comparing quality, value, portion size etc.  The lunch started off with egg drop soup which was nice and light and an iceberg salad with an asian type of ranch dressing .  The entree (as pictured) included fried rice, a spring roll and and a crab puff, delicious.  There was enough food left over for another meal and the service was extremely prompt and friendly.  This is a really good choice for a neighborhod chinese place in the far SE valley, either dine in or take out.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best Chinese restaurants ever. I would chose this over PF changs lol Everything was GREAT! Especially the lo mein... we've been dying to go and eat there again when we're back in town!"}
{"text":"We got take out tonight ( located next to Albertsons) and I was worried about some of the negative reviews.  Well no need !  Beef and pea pods delicious.   Mongolian beef excellent per hubby.   Chicken egg rolls some of the best I've had.  We will be back for sure    So glad to find a great Chinese food place."}
{"text":"I adore this restaurant. When I first went a few years ago, I can't say I enjoyed it. I got orange chicken or something and it was soggy and gross, and I didn't go back for a year. I'm incredibly glad that I did go back, however, because I love their food now.  I'm a regular who orders pork fried rice, crab angels, wonton soup and teriyaki chicken to go- every other week at least. They have plenty of yummy food but that's by far my favorite, it runs about $22 total. Their chow mein is delicious as well, as is their lo mein. The noodles are always just right and just saucy enough. The atmosphere is always calm and mostly quiet, it's never all that busy because alot of people get take-out, and I like that.   I love Chen's, it's been my family's go-to restaurant for years now when we want something quick, affordable and delicious."}
{"text":"Decent food for the price.   Not great but not bad.  Kids like it.  One exception is the pot stickers.   Those are really good."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Best chinese food ever. Especially the orange chicken. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and nice people... Me as my kids eat here 2 times a month... Good food for the price! Love the spicy noodles"}
{"text":"Food is really hood!  Great flavor!   Best I have had since I left New York!!!   Fried rice is amazing........so fresh!! We love the take out!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come here it's the rudest worst service. The food is good but the main waitress is always awful and rude. I get take out so I do not have to be in her presence."}
{"text":"This place is the worst customer service I have ever experienced! Do not go to the place for Chinese food! I walked in to ask about plate size and catering size  for a big family dinner for Chow mein. After seeing the size of the plates to go (which is very small), and the price for cateting, I decided it wasn't what I needed for my family/ friends dinner. I thanked them for helping me and as I was walking out, an old lady who worked there said \"if your not going to order anything, don't come here\". I turned around and I said \"excuse me, what did you say?\" And the lady said as she is making hand motion to leave (like shooing away), \"bye, bye\". How rude?! It got me so upset that I told her that they have poor customer service! I couldn't believe somebody who works there would say something like that. I told my family and now advising people of this place of the rude customer service I experienced and hopefully nobody will receive that type of RUDE customer service at this place. I have to say though, the gentleman at the counter was helpful and nice. That lady needs to have some training on great and friendly customer service if she wants customers coming to their restaurant. The one star goes to the gentleman helping me at the counter, as I didn't get to try the food. Unfortunately, my family, friends and I will never be going to this Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"My youngest daughter chose Chen's for our \"date night\" restaurant.  Every couple weeks I go out one-on-one with one of the kids, my wife with the other and we switch off.  Make sure we get some one on time with each of them.  They pick the restaurant (within reason).  So we ordered fried wonton's by mistake (our mistake, we meant to order crab rangoon, didn't see that and ordered the first thing that sounded similar without reading thoroughly) and it was OK.  Fried wonton filled with pork and scallion.  We also ordered the chicken fried rice.  Again, OK.  Nothing special, basic Chinese fried rice.  Safe.  When it came to an entree' I said \"Why don't we try something more interesting.\"  My daughter said \"OK\", and ordered sweet and sour chicken.  It was then it occurred to me that my kids have possibly never had sweet and sour chicken because we (and they for the most part) shy away from the standard fare at Chinese restaurants.  Anyway, the sweet and sour chicken was also OK.  Oddly, a few of the peppers were cold as if thrown into the chicken at the last second.    Portions were good, there were plenty of leftovers.  The food was such that the leftovers have only a 50/50 chance of actually being eaten...Basically 2.5 star fare."}
{"text":"I usually come to this place about once a month. Today I had a horrible experience. The cashier was extremely rude. I ordered to go and when I got there to pick up my food I was confused because there seemed to be more than I ordered in the box. I tried to discuss it with the cashier but she was very dismissive and just kept saying \"okay bye\" to me. So rude I will never go there again. Was also embarrassing for her to do this in front of other customers. The other cashier who I believe is her daughter rolled her eyes and shook her head like she was embarrassed. Never again. Way too over priced too. Now might I say \"okay bye\" to you Chens!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and Chicken with vegetables.  The noodles were overly cooked in the LoMein and flavorless.  The Chicken had a very odd taste.  I called to complain and only received a refund on the Chicken and Vegetables.  Whoever I spoke with was reluctant on refunding my $$.  I will not be going back! Worst customer service!"}
{"text":"Food court food in a strip plaza. Not the best, not the worst. Service was okay... I'd go back in a pinch since there aren't many options so close."}
{"text":"The take out portions just keep getting smaller and smaller!  Prices keep going up and portions smaller.  Time to find a new take-out place"}
{"text":"We have there carry out once a week. Excellent, fast service and always great food at a very fair price:)"}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing. Worst Chinese food I ever had. I asked of they have some type of fried wings or chicken they gave me fried chicken breasts that were cut up in pieces that had no flavor. Ordered chop suey and it tasted rotten. Also had beef Mongolian and it didn't taste right as well. Too bad I took this to go and ate it at home. I didn't want to drive back to the restaurant and complain to get my money back. My stomach was hurting the next few hours because of their food. I had to call of work due to food poisoned. I had a feeling their food was either old or they mixed their old food with the new one. Not good. I will never go back here."}
{"text":"My first experience with Chen's was excellent.  I cannot comment on the service as this was take out only.  The food is very fresh and tastes great. The lady who took the order was very nice and helpful.  I cannot understand any poor reviews of this restaurant as the food is not only good but fairly priced as well.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, attitude they display is they hate the local people. I wouldn't trust their food ever again."}
{"text":"I have yet to eat anything here that knocks my socks off. It is a decent place, though, not bad by any means. Today I had the Broccoli with Garlic Sauce. Just ok. I was happy I was able to swap out white rice for my preferred brown rice. Don't worry, Chen's, I will be back!"}
{"text":"We visited Chen's for the first time last week because it was close to our house. We were pleasantly surprised. The food was good, building was clean and they were very attentive to drink refills. The only thing that I would suggest is that they check the quality of their iced tea. Maybe making sure it is fresh? Otherwise the General Tso's Chicken was our favorite as well as the Egg Flower soup."}
