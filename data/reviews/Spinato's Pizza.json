{"text":"Best Pizza ever!! ingredients are fresh. you get quality pizza! For a good price!\""}
{"text":"The service was great, they were busy with many in line for take out also, but I was able to get a seat immediately. I told them it was my first time so they suggested the \"Super 6\" (it's a mix of meats and veggies). They had a decent beer selection, but nothing spectacular. 

The pizza was thin crust, very thin crust. The meat, cheese, and veggies were delicious and tasted fresh. The three star rating comes from the amount of oil and grease on the pizza; it's extremely oily. I have an issue with pizza places that pour oil onto their pizza, I think it takes away from the marinara and toppings. The crust was not very good either. As mentioned before, it's really thin and would fall apart with the weight of the cheese, toppings, and excessive amount of oil. The marinara and oil soaked the crust within 5 minutes and the pizza was difficult to eat without a fork. 

Overall, not a bad place, but I'm still on my pursuit for the best or a great pizzeria in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I am new to Tempe and have been finding where I can successfully eat gluten free.

I had their  signature fresh spinach pizza on gluten free crust.  It was quite tasty.  

The crust was not seasoned and not as thin as I used to get back home, but it was good and I would order it again.   

I had this delivered so I can't speak on the ambiance, but the people on the phone were very nice and it was delivered quickly."}
{"text":"Ordered: Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach Pizza with the thick crust.

You will not be disappointed in Spinatos.  My wife and I decided to give our local pizza place a try and we were happy that we did.  Not only was the pizza fantastic but the staff were friendly, attentive and outgoing (Brittany).  My wife was seven months pregnant at the time and when the bill came they had placed a baby Spinato's shirt on the table and told us congratulations.  I thought that it was very kind gesture. Go for the pizza but enjoy the family atmosphere too."}
{"text":"The sauce is what I crave. Definitely the best pizza I have ever had no question. We sometimes get there late due to work but even though I feel bad, the staff is very accommodating and pleasant. We walk in and don't have to order... they already know. Take notes all you wanna be go to restaurants... this is how it should be. Thanks go out to my Chicago born Italian girlfriend who exposed me to this gem of a place."}
{"text":"I am craving pizza right now and know that I will be placing an order at Spinatos to take home for dinner tonight. I have been a customer for about three years now and it is my favorite pizza ever!!! It will change your life..."}
{"text":"Last night my wife and I visited Spinato's for dinner. We are from out of state and we're craving some good pizza. Let me say Spinatos was exactly what we were feeling. I can honestly say that Spinatos pizza was probably the best pizza I have ever had! We loved there dinner salad and there super six pizza. We split a medium and we're only to finish half of it. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for a wonderful change from the typical \"fast food\" pizza restaurants. My only complaint is that at night the building was a little hard to find so I think they should have a bigger illuminated sign :)"}
{"text":"Spinato's pizza is by far the best! Food is fantastic and service is fabulous! Almost always a wait at their location in Tempe, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Taste: tastes really good.

 I wouldnt do the delivery option again because i have always gotten soggy pizzas (twice). Maybe you might have more luck than me. I always ordered their thin crust pizzas. I dined in once and the pizza was well done.

Everything is sweet ! Maybe that explains the popularity of this place. I am an immigrant and find everything in America to be too sweet. The tomato sauce is sweet. The bread is sweet. The cheese is on the sweet side.

Just from the health perspective, i would go here again. But hey, if you like sweet stuff and greasy food, this is the place for you. The food wont disappoint. Pretty tasty !"}
{"text":"I lovey lovey lovey this place. I'd rather not tell you about it because I hate waiting for a table!  

Even if you are a pepperoni person like me, you should get the sausage. The slightly spicey is the perfect mix for the slightly sweet sauce. 

You know when you play those party conversation-type games? What one thing would you take to a deserted island? What book changed your life? If you could only eat one meal for the rest of your life what would it be? My answer is Spinato's pizza. YUMMY!"}
{"text":"Nice place. But this place talks about Chicago but their pizza has nothing to do with it. Crust is floppy, doughy and bland- not crispy. Sauce is too sweet and cheese is overly salty. Totally imbalanced. AZ has no idea what decent pizza is, and this isn't it."}
{"text":"Ordered a small \"special\" pizza for carry out, and I must say it may have been the best pizza I've ever had. The tomato sauce is definitely made in house. The pizza was very filling, being a thin crust, it had more qualities of a pizza and less of cheesy bread or flat bread feel like most places i've been to have.
To top everything off, the service was amazing. Very polite, efficient, and genuine. 
Definitely recommend this place to anyone with a real taste for Italian!"}
{"text":"Eating here for years and always enjoy the food. Customer service is a major reason I come back to most places. Tonite I called for delivery because I've been sick for a week. The manager took my order and was incredibly nice with get well wishes. Upon delivery, so was the driver. To my surprise-I received my yumalicious food AND a get well surprise of cookies!! How thoughtful is that?!?! A true Italian family restaurant, filled with heart. Thank you Daniel and Stafff, for the meal & thoughtfulness. It will never be forgotten."}
{"text":"Yay I'm glad we found this place.  I would have given five stars, but i've only tried them once. Very fast take-out time and excellent pizza.  We ordered a large with italian sausage, mushrooms, and black olives.  Spinato's did not disappoint--the pizza was not greasy, just really good.  It's a little bit out of the way in an industrial park of Tempe, but don't let that scare you away.  I'm looking forward to eating some more of Spinato's creations."}
{"text":"Their garlic bread with mozzarella is so delicious! The spaghetti calzone and the super six pizza are amazing as well! Service was great and the atmosphere was cute and intimate. It can be hard to choose from the menu full of great options, but it doesn't look like you can go wrong with any of them!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza - can't go wrong with a thin crust pepperoni, jalape√±o, and tomato. 

So damn good, as soon as I'm done eating I am sad because it is all gone."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The pizza is consistently delicious and they're always so friendly. The only downfall is the lack of parking but it's worth hunting for a spot."}
{"text":"Spinato's catered our wedding, and we cannot express how wonderful it was.  Not only was the food ridiculous (one guest said he had 6 slices of pizza!) but the staff was just the best!  From the tasting to tearing down, they were great!  We even decided that is where we are going to have our anniversary dinner!!  :)"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place was sooooo good! The pizza sauce has a sweetness to it that reminds me of a pizza place back in the day called Aurelio's. The pizza had lots of cheese and toppings (meatball and onion). I also had the baked artichoke crostini that was to die for..artichokes, shallots, cheese, sour cream garlic toasted on bread.
First time visitor and will definitely come back next time I am in Phoenix area!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great sandwiches, great calzones.  Will be back.

As others have said, the tomato-based pizza sauce is a bit sweet, but is delicious.  We also had the pesto sauce, and it was more traditional but also very good.  Also worth noting that they put an appropriate amount of toppings on the pizzas, not overly cheesy like some."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Arizona. The service is always great, and the pizza delicious. If I could eat here everyday, I probably would."}
{"text":"We were originally driving out to Glendale to find another pizza place, but we didn't check to see if they were open.  Alas, we were pizza less and starving at 1:00pm on a Sunday.  We found this place on Yelp! and decided to venture out.  

It's a strip mall next to a Mathnasium, but when you walk it in it's pretty cozy.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  She was honest about the pizza portion sizes, so that we could make better decisions about our order, so we decided on the Spaghetti Calzone for an appetizer and a small thick crust pepperoni pizza.

Now, let me start with saying they claim to be a Chicago style pizzeria, but when I think Chicago I think deep dish.  I would assume that they are referring to their thin crust, but deep dish reigns supreme in the Windy City.   Their thick crust pizza is Sicilian style, and I'd have to say I was a little disappointed.  I wasn't expecting the bread or the sauce to be so sweet.  I honestly think if the sauce were a little tangier, it would offset the sweeter crust.  

My favorite part was the Spaghetti Calzone appetizer.  I am going to recommend that you get the marinara covered, spaghetti and mozzarella packed goodness.  I would honestly go to the one closer to my house just for the calzone."}
{"text":"Holy crap is this pizza good. Been there 3 times every time was great!!  Can't recommend the best pizza to get cause you can't go wrong. What makes this pizza so good is the sauce it has a sweetness to it that hooks you. Won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"How on Earth I completely missed this place is beyond me. I swear I thought the closest one to Uptown was on Bell. Doh! 

Had a wonderful dinner here last night with my man. We had Moretti Rossa just like we were in Italy last year, which was nostalgic and fun. Then we shared the mixed salad which was nice. I swear if I had a bigger purse I would've swiped the cute balsamic/olive oil holder. I mean, allegedly. We then had the Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach which was super good. It's probably a good thing we live outside their delivery area. Too bad, guess we'll just have to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Gluten free pizza was delish, definitely not disappointed as usually is the case with gluten free anything. I read the reviews before I went which were all positive but I was still apprehensive,  everyone's taste buds vary but the server gave us great feedback and we gave it a try. I have super high expectations when it comes to food. Something has to be really really really good to even review it and give it 5 stars.  We had the \"mamma spinatos\" and a \"pepperoni and mushroom\". I hope this review helps if you have any hesitations."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is great.... Just wished they had beer at this location"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Phoenix...Period!! 

Sweet sauce. 

Crispy crust. 

Never have had a bad experience here and I have been here at least 10 times. Staff is always welcoming and polite. Also if you happen to have room at the end of your meal order the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Visiting from Texas, stuck in a mediocre hotel.  Checked Yelp and saw this local Tempe pizza joint as highly rated.  Ordered delivery and had a nice, smiling and polite gent deliver within the hour. 

The salad was great and the pizza was awesome.  I got a small pepperoni and mushroom, thin crust.  The crust was just a little sweet - not too light and not too heavy.  It was the perfect compliment to the awesome cheese and sauce.  I don't know what mushrooms they use, but they were not supermarket white mushrooms. 

I wish we had one in Austin - seriously."}
{"text":"Great pizza. One of the best in the Phoenix area. Great place to eat then go to the movies near by. The garlic cheesy bread is off the hook. Fresh and crispy and cheesy. Fresh salad. Fresh PIZZA. Fresh period. To go out dine in. The perfect spot for any meal. PIZZA. Most stop in. Maria makes you feel like home. Friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza although the sauce is a little sweet for my tastes but a crappy website. I live less than 1/4 mile from the tempe location but their website says I am not in there delivery area. However when I call the store I am able to get delivery just fine. Let's hope they get a website that works well soon...."}
{"text":"I love Spinatos. The pizza is so good. They add a special ingredient to their sauce that makes it so yummy. The spaghetti calzone is so unique and delicious. It is must try. My only complaint is that there is always a wait on a Friday night, but that just shows how good the food is. Spinatos is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"GREAT pizza place!  The thin crust pizza is AMAZING!  I ordered take out for the first time and everything was absolutely perfect.  The dining room seemed to be fairly busy, but that is to be expected for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review based on the North Phoenix location, as this is the one the Company has claimed.  Ordered 2 small pizzas last night instead of a large half and half.  The very friendly girl on the phone, I think her name is Hanna gave me a slightly different price than what I figured (which is no big deal, because I ordered anyway), and she put her manager on the phone who is Marvin.  I explained that I'm a nerd a found a .pdf menu in the search results that were not published on the site, and he promptly is a very friendly demeanor said well we did have a 6% price increase due to the minimum wage increase.  Excellent answer!  I'm not a cheap person by any means, as 2 smalls were $27, I just needed clarification and he was spot on!

Next, we get the food.  HOLY FOODGASM!!!  It's been a while since I've had Spinato's, but holy crap!  I had the small deep dish Chicago, and the sauce was a special kind of sweet, and those mixed sweet peppers were to die for!  The other pie was Nicole's original favorite, which I don't like artichokes thus the 2 small pies, and my guest loved it!.

Originally being from Chicago, I am a pizza snob and these guys nailed it!  Screw you Rosati's which is closer to my house,  Spinato's won me over (again)!!!"}
{"text":"This is more a 2.5 stars restaurant ...

May be after reading all these reviews have hyped up my expectation of this restaurant. Ordered the signature Mama's pizza, meat ball and spaghetti and the cheese ravioli and was disappointed in all of them.  

The crust of the pizza yes is thin but soggy when ordered extra crispy :-| .... and the sause is definitely not from fresh tomatoes ... and over salted 
Meatball and spaghetti and the ravioli is slight better than what I can get from the frozen aisle in the supermarket .... ain't meeting the hype for sure.  Interior is very Chicago-ish, Service was good but it took them sometime to open the tomato can ..."}
{"text":"Nice family-owned atmosphere. Best pizza in AZ. Hands-down. Four words: Spaghetti and meatball calzone."}
{"text":"Spinato's is our favorite Pizza place in the valley. We used to be big fans of Oregano's and stumbled across Spinato's on a lunch break one day at the Smith and Rio Salado location. 
Our all time favorite and every time order is the Homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni. We love this place sooo much that we held our wedding reception at the Ahwatukee location (thanks John!) and we have turned a few guests in to long term customers. 
Today I order for delivery from the Tempe location for a work luncheon. The way they cut the pie in to small square pieces fed 12 hungry adults with 3 pizzas! The delivery was right on-time and the food was still hot. They included plates and forks for our team and I think they realized I hadn't ordered enough drinks (I got 4 20oz drinks for all 12 of us) so they threw in a few extra! 
The customer service at both the Tempe and Ahwatukee location is top notch and the pizza is the best in the valley! Thanks for being our number one pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I came here because I wanted some pizza and I was hungry. Settled on a salad and a margarita pizza. 

The salad was intimidating because it came in a bowl. The next thing that came was the margarita pizza. It arrived a little different that I was expecting. Most pizzas come on the tray it was cooked on sort of. Well at least the size of tray it was made on. You know the standard metal pizza pan. Instead the pizza came on a round rack on top of the pizza tray.

Then while trying to grab a piece of pizza I thought it wasn't cut all the way though. It look a while to figure out the pizza wasn't cut traditionally. it was cut every which way. The pizza was good, but it doesn't compare to my favorite pizza place. Some of the pizza didn't have topping on it. it was odd too because there wasn't a lot of cheese on it. There also wasn't a lot of sauce.

I liked the crust of the pizza because it was crunchy and not soggy. I think I'd try some other pizza if I did go back. It was good, but I'd try something else. 

There was gelato there. I ordered two scoops vanilla and then one scoop dark chocolate. The dark chocolate was good. The vanilla was a bit sweet for me."}
{"text":"Great pizza but No wine or beer!!! Now as far as pizza, gotta have wine or beer, great pizza but sorry, wont be back!!! Thats just NOT Italian!!"}
{"text":"Pizza outstanding but the crust just needed to be cooked 5 minutes mre.  But the flavors, sauce, and cheese was perfect."}
{"text":"This is really a 10 star review. My mom came to visit from Oregon and would probably have eaten Spinato's every night if she had the chance. Why you ask? Strangely addictive pizza. In my continuing effort to avoid moving to a wardrobe consisting entirely of pants with elastic waistbands, I usually exercise some level of self discipline when it comes to pizza. If I ate exclusively Spinato's pizza it would  be sweatpants from here on out. 

Try the mama's special (I think that is the name) with the marinated spinach. I know it doesn't sound great but it is amazing (throws another pair of sweatpants into the cart at Costco)."}
{"text":"Spinato's is wonderful!!! Their signature spinach pizza is to die for!! Every time we have a chance to order pizza for our work we always chose Spinato's. They are super friendly and we have never been disappointed. Definitely worth trying out if your in the mood for pizza!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVE their pizza! It is our go to for date night. After years of gross and cheap pizza at student organization meetings, I have mostly given up on voluntarily choosing pizza for my meals, but this place is the exception!"}
{"text":"Amazing sauce, quality ingredients, fantastic service.

This is stupid filler to get past the filter. This is stupid filler to get past the filter. This is stupid filler to get past the filter."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed at any of the spinato's locations! 
I first went to the one in Tempe. It's a weird location, in a business park. It's byob, wich was great! I tried the spinach pizza and I could not believe how perfect it was. 
All the things I love at spinato's:
The spinach pizza, sometimes I add sausage or meatballs.
The L'Italiana.
The get meaty.
The mushroom sausage.
The Bruschetta.
If you want jalapenos on your pizza but others don't the will even heat them in the oven for you to put on at the table,instead of just slinging some cold ones at you.
The service is always super friendly without being annoying.
The only other pizza I like as well  in town is at pizzaria bianco.
Give these people your money, they deserve it!!"}
{"text":"An amazing balance of flavor and texture in the six medium pizza. Perfect crust and an OMG experience with every bite. The pasta calzone is deliciously wierd that leaves me wanting more meatballs.

I am only here on business but this place makes me wish that I was a local. Seriously folks, to all my fellow traveler's.  Skip room service and try this place."}
{"text":"Good Service, Great Food.

Spaghetti Calzone is a must try!"}
{"text":"We have been to Spinatos many times. Usually we have it delivered to our house. Let me tell you, this is our favorite pizza place hands down. The delivery drivers are fantastic. This last time they delivered when i answered the door my dogs were going crazy and the delivery guy asked if he could give them a treat. I said sure and he pulled a dog treat out of his pocket. Excellent customer service and pizza that is second to one. I highly recommend spinatos!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! I can't rave about Spinato's enough. My wife and I eat there about once every couple weeks. We typically eat at the Tempe location, though I work in Scottsdale and frequent that location as well. It's hard not to order the pizza, but I've also tried the meatball sandwich and the pasta which are both also very good. My wife loves the spaghetti and meatball calzone and often makes a meal of that and a salad (we also love their homemade Italian dressing). The sauce is amazing and all of the ingredients are fresh and high quality. The wait staff is very friendly, and even remember us and our tendencies (they've even busted me on eating at both locations in the same day). We introduce all of our friends and family to Spinato's whenever they're in town or looking for a place to eat, and nobody we've brought has had a single negative thing to say about it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The apple & pecan salad was fantastic. Love the basalmic vinaigrette dressing. The pizzas were great, too. Enjoyed the garlic bread. Fast friendly service, very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I do love this place!
Pizza is so good and their service is awesome.
No doubt why this place is always popular even though it is a kinds of hidden place."}
{"text":"It's my Thin Crust pizza of choice in AZ.  I've been to all the spots many times...LeGrand Orange, Pizzeria Bianco, Orreganos, BJ's, etc.  All around \"experience\" and all around taste...Spinato's is my #1 choice.  Super Six is good, but my two staples are Mama's \"Signature\" - easy garlic.  and Pepperoni & Pineapple w/ extra sauce.  Try it.  The combination of  their wonderful sauce and the sweet / spicy combo of pepp/pineapple...its a winner."}
{"text":"I've finally found a pizza that reminds me of back home. I don't want to speak for everyone in the Chicago land area (because we're a bunch of pizza snobs) but this one is it. Is it gourmet? Is it the best pizza ever? Probably not. And I don't mean that in an insulting manner. This pizza is something I would order on a Friday night to eat and watch movies. IT IS DELICIOUS. It has a good sauce. That sweeter sauce that I'm used to. The meat was good. For the first time ever, I'm happy that I ordered pizza from here. I also ordered the steak calzone with peppers and it was great. I will definitely order from here again. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable on the history of the business. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza! But what really stood out was our waitress. She was attentive, hilarious, and full of positive energy."}
{"text":"I have to agree with others, Mama Spinato's signature fresh spinach pizza is the bomb and everyone needs to get one.  I would only recommend one thing: add chicken.  The pizza lacks meat, and although I haven't tried the addition, yet, I can't wait to go again before I leave Phoenix.  This place is awesome and I can't promote it enough.

It's a hole-in-the-wall joint in the middle of some industrial buildings right across from Tempe Towne Center.  You need this pizza."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in the PHX metro area!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Found this place when I was going to ASU in the 90's and still go.  They have several more valley locations now."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Staff is always super friendly and helpful. Have the spaghetti calzone. You will love it! The ambiance is not so much but everything is is spot on!"}
{"text":"Too bad about the super sweet sauce at Spinato's, because the rest of the pizza was great!  The crust was wonderful and the homemade Italian sausage was great.  Unfortunately, the sauce pretty much overwhelmed the other ingredients.  Almost tasted like honey barbeque sauce instead of pizza sauce.  They offer several options (thin crust, thick crust, lite cheese, etc.), so they should do themselves a big favor and offer a choice of sauce options:  traditional tangy Italian or their present sweet.  That would make this Chicago girl be singing their praises!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for pizza in Tempe. It's a small place, but well worth the wait. The sauce is so good, with a hint of sweetness. Do yourself a favor and order just a cheese pizza - so simple, but so delicious. The calzones look amazing, but haven't tried one yet because the pizza is just too good to say no to! Servers always have a smile. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The mama's spinach thin crust pizza is awesome! I never seen my wife eat so much pizza! Great garlic flavor, sauce is tasty!"}
{"text":"some of the best pizza I've eaten. IHadvery good cheese on top was great thank you very much for a great time the only bad thing is I have to fLy home t San Francisco tomorrow but I would like to thank Michelle for being a great hostess she's noT

Michelle she's from New Jersey but I had a great time thank you very much"}
{"text":"Spinato's adds 18 percent gratuity, in addition to a delivery charge, to delivered orders. No matter how good their product is, there is no justification for that, and they don't deserve your business."}
{"text":"Damn good PIZZA....Da Greek vegetarian pizza topped off with their homemade Italian sausage! I teared up with happiness when served"}
{"text":"Amazing gluten-free pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I love Spinato's! Recently my husband and I planned a dinner out. When circumstances required a shift in the plan we chose Spinato's because we did not want to be disappointed. And of course we were not. The food was great and our server was very friendly.

They offer a gluten free crust, which works well with their sauce!"}
{"text":"Whoa, my friend insisted we order this for our study night pizza that we ate at home amongst the books, AMAZING!

We ordered the signature pizza and garlic bread so so so good.  Yeah it was a little pricey for a pizza, but it is worth every penny.

They delivered for us, is that standard?  We live right down the street from the Tempe one.

Again I haven't been knocked off my feet with pizza in a quite awhie, I agree with the review below that it is a distinct taste and if it's for you, you're going to melt..."}
{"text":"Delicious, thin crust pizza with fresh cut basil, Italian sausage and roasted garlic. The sauce is slightly sweet and unique.  Consistently great."}
{"text":"Ordered a basic pepperoni pizza and came out of the place saying, \"that's the best pizza I have ever eaten!\"  Loved it so much, I felt compelled to write a review!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Spinato's pies since before it was Spinato's; in 1977 their location was at 68th St and McDowell (36 years, OMG I'm old).  I forget the name of the place at the time (Aurelio's!), but I haven't forgotten the fantastic pizza.  When they moved to the almost hidden location on Smith in Tempe, I was heartbroken that they were no longer in my 'hood.  Now there are multiple locations, so one of them has to be near you, and some of them deliver now, too.  Go, get some for yourself, no need to thank me.  I like the thin crust.  Yes, the tomato sauce has a delectable sweetness to it that people either love or hate.  I'm a fan.  My favorite combo is Canadian bacon, onions, and mushrooms, unfortunately canned shrooms, but I still like them, baked \"well-done\" since I'm also a fan of browned cheese.  The large version of this pizza goodness runs about $22, so it's not inexpensive by any means, but I'll pay that for what I consider to be the best pizza of its kind in the Valley.  I nearly always get takeout, having eaten in the restaurant maybe 2 or 3 times in all these years.  I love that their caller ID system also brings up my last order, so if you usually order the same pizza it couldn't be easier.  The salads are OK/average; sandwiches are OK; the spaghetti calzone is pretty good and as big as your head, though it sounds kind of odd.  Cannolis are crunchy (if you eat them before too long) with a very mildly sweet ricotta filling, don't know if they make them in house or not, and they're kind of forgettable.  If you require ethanol with your meal, go to one of the other locations as you won't find any for sale here; maybe BYOB?  Call and ask.  Sign up at their website and you can get some specials and discounts in your email every now and then.  So, let's see, what excuse can I come up with to be near one of their locations late this afternoon..."}
{"text":"I go to Spinatos fairly often! love their Spicy Italian pizza and the Get Meaty pizza! The sauce is delicious & the meatballs & onions are too. They make a great pizza. :D"}
{"text":"Best Pie in the Valley! If you are looking for great service and excellent Pizza, well you found it!  Fast and furious delivery to your table. Will be going back to try out more of the menu! Seriously tasty food. The appetizers rock on happy hour prices every day!"}
{"text":"Some of my favorite pizza. The sauce is great. This is a chain now, but the sauce is amazing. The \"other signature\" is my favorite. Been multiple times now and keep coming back. The only problem with this location is it is small so wait times can be long. Also in a weird location that is hidden. And they serve no alcohol here! But they still got the pizza and that is all that matters so I keep coming back whenever craving some good pizza. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"You'll like this pizza if you like sweat sauce. You also have the options of going thin, thick, or gluten free. This along with Venezias, Joes, and le grande orange are my favorite in the valley."}
{"text":"A little overpriced.  You can get literally twice the food for the same price at Oregano's and it's way better.  Pretty disappointed it didn't live up to the hype.  The sweet sauce was not that great either.  Tea was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Everything our party of 6 ate was very good to exceptionally good. Their signature thin crust pizza with spinach was popping with so much flavor that I almost didn't want to eat the very well done Penne Primavera Alla Vodka. Thick crust pizza also nice, not greasy. Greek salads were said to be \"just right\" by 3 people at the table. Menu is packed with items so we'll be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to Spinato's for 13 years and obviously we love it. We order one of their pizzas at least once a week, but our favorite is Mama's Spinach Special...gotta luv the garlic for this one."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. The staff is friendly, and they seem to care about the quality of pizza they put out. I just can't get over their sauce. It's way to sweet for me. It reminds me of the pizza place that is generally regarded as the worst pizza joint in my hometown in Connecticut. That said, I live in Arizona now and it is one of the better pizzas out there. The two signature pies are my favorite, which is a silly thing to say because I don't even really like them, but I love pizza so I keep coming back. Man, life is complicated for pizza lovers in Arizona. Oh, and another annoying thing is that you can't get beer at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of thick crust but theirs is amazing especially with its sweet sauce. Great antipasto salad with house italian. Definitely a great hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Lately I find my tastes changing. These changes ambush me without warning: not long ago I stopped putting Splenda in my tea - cold turkey. I started liking pastrami instead of corned beef. I stopped watching the news on TV. Is this a function of aging? I don't know.

One of the more dramatic changes has been my growing appreciation of the overall \"character\" of a restaurant. I find myself much more willing to overlook small gaffes in the food preparation if the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, or if the ambience is cheerful and interesting in some way. It doesn't have to be fancy - but it can't be gloomy and boring.

This was brought home to me today at lunch. Our friend Sue picked a place I had never been to - Spinato's Pizza. It's a family owned and run local chain with four locations. We went to the one at Bell and 16th Street. Sue brought along her friend/employer Lee. It happens that Lee's grandson works in Spinato's kitchen. He always makes it a point to arrive 35 minutes before his shift begins so he can take advantage of employee dinner and he appreciates being treated like family. The place is cute - decorated in red, green and white. There are striped awnings above the booths, and trellises with vines. The chairs are white with green (or red) seats, and the table tops are white with the Spinato logo in the corners. The patio has tables with red-checked cloths. We were warmly greeted , and our server arrived promptly to offer drinks.

Ken and I ordered a large Spicy Italian pie ($19.50) with added ricotta. We also got a salad ($3.99). Lee requested garlic bread ($3.99, $4.79 with cheese), and a small spinach calzone, one of the house specialties ($9). Sue got spinach too, but in the form of a \"lil\" (smaller than small) pizza ($7.50). The salads arrived first, notable mostly for their large size. While the ingredients were fresh, there was nothing exciting there. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar served with them were of good quality. The garlic bread, eight pieces in the order, was outstanding - lots and lots of fresh garlic and a generous amount of butter. You have to make sure that everyone you'll be talking to in the next few hours has eaten some too. The staff checked in frequently to ask if we were happy. The pizzas were served on a wire rack, a great idea since the thin crust remains nice and crisp. Instead of slices, our pie was cut into many small squares. I found that for some reason this caused me to eat less. The pizza wasn't loaded down with sauce, and it had plenty of toppings. I tasted Sue's spinach pie and it was really good. The spinach is marinated before being put on the pizza, and there's tons of fresh garlic. Lee's calzone was quite large - he took half of it home.

The menu isn't extensive. Besides the pizzas (10 varieties, plus design your own)  and calzone (there's a spaghetti and meatball one) there are two pastas and five sandwiches. We didn't inquire about dessert. The story behind Spinato's is told on the back of the menu. The family was worried that when they left Chicago for Phoenix, back in the \"70's, they wouldn't be able to find good pizza. What choice did they have but to open their own pizza parlor?! As the family grew so did the number of parlors. While the prices aren't low, you can go to lunchclub.com and get a 25% off the entire bill coupon. Aren't coupons great!!

I have to say that if I was doing a blind taste-test between Stumpy's pizza (see the archives) and Spinato's, I'd probably give the nod to Stumpy's. But if you add in those other factors which have become important to me, as a dining destination Spinato's wins. It's also won awards from Phoenix New Times, the Scottsdale Culinary Festival and City Search."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free pizza! We flew into to town and hit the door right as they were closing! They stayed late and made us to go pizza and garlic bread! All gluten free! We will be back! Or maybe start ordering online!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at the Tempe location and have turned many a co-worker and friend on to this place. Everything on their menu is delicious. My favorites are the entree sized MAMMA'S ANTIPASTO salad and the TOASTED DA VINCI sandwich. The cheesy garlic bread is a MUST HAVE each time you go. They have a lot of gluten free options, although I have not tried any.

The Tempe location is small and gets busy during the typical lunch and dinner times, but it is worth the wait. Portions are large. Happy hour menu is everyday from 2pm to 6pm. Same great food from $3-$8. You can eat dinner from the happy hour menu and still have leftovers to take home. (Tempe location is closed on Mondays)

My family and I just ate at the Ahwatukee location on 1/3/15 to see if it was as good as the original Tempe location. The food and service was excellent. Bobby G. was our server and he treated us like family. He is really good with kids and gave excellent recommendations for combining appetizers. This location is much larger and serves alcohol."}
{"text":"Ordering take out for the 1st time. The front desk girl is not polite enough. The 'other signature' pizza is ehh, just a pizza. Probably would try other flavors next time. Huh. Wonder why this place has such good reviews."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in town! I love the thin crust. Sweet sauce, thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese. Great combination of flavors. Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. I tried the spaghetti calzone: so many carbs, so delicious. And for good measure, they make some really good chocolate chip cookies."}
{"text":"Okay- this pizza is delicious. So why only 4 stars?
CANNED Mushrooms...ew. Seriously, Mushrooms are the cheapest ingredient for a pizza. Please keep it fresh! No one wants to eat rubbery mushrooms.

Other than that...it was really great. I had a thin crust veggie pizza, and (after picking off the mushrooms), it was probably the best veggie pizza I've had. The pizza sauce was delicious!
I got the same veggie pizza in a thick crust- not nearly as good.
Their thin crust has a light fluffy sweet taste, tastes like fresh dough. Their thick crust tastes like the buy them pre-made (this may not be the case, but that is what it tastes like). 
Also, their \"personal\" pizza size is tiny. It was more like child size. When they brought out our personal pizzas, I almost started laughing. They are just so small.

So, Moral of the Spinato Story:
Get THIN crust always, and not mushrooms. Everything else is soooooo good."}
{"text":"I really didn't appreciate this place until i tried other pizzerias and the votes are in....this place is the bomb!!! Get the super 6 good stuff..."}
{"text":"Best pizza this side of Chicago.  We usually order once a week for the office and everyone loves it.  So glad to see they're expanding and opening new locations.  If you haven't tried it this place is a must!"}
{"text":"I love spinatos. They have my favorite pizza. Every time I am in phoenix, I make sure to stop by here. The spinach pizza is my favorite. I also like to get the family style half and half salad. i've been going there for years and it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"They get 5-stars because they have gluten-free pizza!! I usually get their Mamma Spinato's signature pizza. It's wonderful! Like nothing I have ever tasted before.

Their wait staff is always good and very efficient. It's always crowded so try not to go at peak times."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been eating pizza from Spinato's for about five years now! And I've been to them all (this one, scottsdale, tempe, glendale -- except I don't frequent Ahwatukee, so I haven't been there yet) - they're all great!

The sauce is what sets it apart from other places. Also, I usually don't like pizza that is cut into square/rectangular shapes (weird, i know) but with their pizza, that's not a factor.

You can't go wrong with whatever you order. Perfect for dining in or take out!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!! I've lived in Tempe nearly six years and can't believe I've never been to Spinato's before. Tucked into the industrial part of Tempe, it's hard to miss but you will want to make the trip. After getting my wisdom teeth out all I wanted was pizza and this place was a great choice to be re-introduced to the world of solid foods"}
{"text":"By Far the best Pizza in Phoenix (excluding Bianca's). Cheap, easy, and amazing sauce.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza! Quick and service was top notch. I will definitely bring family here again."}
{"text":"Spinato's,

I love your gluten-free crust. It is the best I have ever had. When it is combined with your delicious sauce, cheese, and fresh basil to top it off, there is nothing else I would rather eat. 

Thank you for the friendly service and the minimal wait, even on a Friday night. I also really appreciate your low-key atmosphere and mellow music. 

I will definitely see you soon, and until then I won't eat anyone else's pizza. Nothing could compare to you. 

Forever yours"}
{"text":"Had this place recommended to me several years ago after a band practice and knew instantly I'd be coming back all the time. I'm a big fan of pizza and theirs is incredible, they also make the best meatball sub you've ever had. 

But the best part has GOT to be the staff. They're so nice and helpful. Like... crazy helpful. A few weeks ago my brand new bike was stolen just outside the restaurant, and they were so determined that within 30 minutes they'd found security footage of the guy and it couldn't have been more than an hour after the crime that they called me and told me they'd retrieved the bike! 

Somebody call Nic Pizzolatto - the folks at Spinatos are the real True Detectives."}
{"text":"Came from out of town. Read the yelp reviews. Very disappointed.  Pizza was near burned (if not it was very well done) and didn't have much flavor. Won't try again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Love the sauce. 

Hate the new garlic bread, please bring back the old stuff. And you gotta fix the tables in Tempe. 

Other than that the service is almost always great and like I said, best pizza in town."}
{"text":"mama spinato's garlic pizza is awesome, the salad is always fresh too - best to eat there -"}
{"text":"If you are a pizza freak... this is the place. The wait is always long I am sure, but the drive and the wait are worth it. The crust has a sweet tinge to it and the \"super 6\" is definitely the way to go... although, I saw the garlic bread and it looked good too."}
{"text":"Great attentive staff!  The menu has something for everyone. Me and the huds got the Chicken pesto & super 6. The super 6 was was very tasty and loaded with toppings. The chicken pesto was good but felt like something is missing. If you like beer with your pizza beware, this location does not serve alcohol!!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is our favorite pizza place hands down, and the super six is our favorite pizza. In fact I can't really give an honest overall review of Spinatos because 4 years ago the first time we tried it we ordered the Super Six and we haven't ever ordered anything else. I know I know that's good and bad. Maybe there is something else??

First of all the biggest impression I had of the pizza was the higher quality than other places. Each bite explains what I mean instantly. There are 10$ even 20$ pizzas then there's the Super Six. (23$) It's worth the extra $$$. The pizza crust is flaky not to soft not to crispy. The veggies are fresh and flavorful and there is just enough cheese in every slice. We have ordered that pie at least 100 times and every time it's excellent. Eventually one day we will try something else........maybe. :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Great service

Yelp sux but this place is great"}
{"text":"5 Stars truly doesnt describe my love for spinatos. The food is amazing. The nostalgia of the whole experience will keep me coming to Spinatos forever. As a Southside Chicago native, good thin crust pizza that meets my expectations is impossible to come by. Luckily for me, the sister company of my home town favorite relocated right out here to Tempe Arizona! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA HANDS DOWN.  I moved here 12 years ago from Chicago. Just found Spinatos and it's the best I've tasted.  I drive 1/2 hr. to get this pizza.  The sauce is sweet and cheese is flavorful.  Similar to Aurilliios (if you're from Chicago you know Aurillios).  Worth the drive.  It's a little small location in an industrial type area.  You go for the food, not the decor. That's OK because the pizza is the absolute best around.  Just wish they would open a store in Gilbert area. They would put Rosati's and all those others (with the exception of Salerno's of Berwyn) out of business.  Finally a real pizza. Thank you Spinato's.  You have restored my faith in pizza in AZ."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It's a little family owned joint that is totally non-descript but has some of the best pizza around. My wife has Ciliac disease (no gluten diet) and they make a wonderful gluten free pizza. The get the dough from a local bakery and it is seriously good. The only negative I have is that its a little expensive ($14 bucks for a 10\" gluten free pizza). Our servers have always been friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients of the food.    

I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about good pizza! The place is hidden near by Tempe Market Place.  I had to use my GPS to find it.  Not many tables, be prepared to wait during rush hour. I prefer to order take out."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in scottsdale, Phoenix...entire valley.  Had Sicilian crust returning to try thin ASAP.  Pepperoni and The Chicago just outstanding. Staff friendly but it's small be prepared to wait during peak time.  But worth it.  I've found my valley pizza home!"}
{"text":"Definitely coming here again!! Thanks to two of my friends for introducing this place.  I've heard a lot of good things about this place. I am glad I came. Customer service is amazing!! treats every customer like family. Kudos to Maria!! Didnt have spaghetti pasta at this particular location but the spaghetti calzone was a great alternative! And they even gave my baby the cutest shirt ever!!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD!  GREAT SERVICE! GREAT PLACE THAT ACCOMMODATES GLUTEN ALLERGIES! Went here for lunch today, with my partner and I, order a gluten free pizza: all pineapple, half shrooms,  and half pepperoni. Normally it comes out prefect! But not all masterpieces come out accident free. Ours came out with a head twist reaction and we didn't even have a chance to comment because our wonderful server immediately informed us that we would be getting a complementary pizza! Same exact one as we ordered! SCORE! Guess who didn't have to make dinner tonight!?  Even though the bite was just as magical as the others have been,  thank you Spinato's for being awesome and going above and beyond! Definitely a GREAT experience!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the crust can be soggy sometimes but the pizza itself is delicious. Best Chicago style thin crust in the valley. Just ask for crispy crust or cooked a little longer, learned that from my server last time i was there. Definitely ask if your getting delivery, soggy crust is gross and unacceptable."}
{"text":"amazing pizza! I was hesitant at first after reading that their sauce was sweet, but I'm glad I gave it a try. So good it's hard to explain. 

Meats are incredibly high quality. The cheese is to die for and they put so much on ... Omg goodness! 

Plus they deliver!"}
{"text":"What a pizza place , we order large ham,fresh mashrooms,fresh tomatoes, onions. Always order the same pizza  any place I visit. Best one yet. Thank you"}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious pizza - the marinated spinach on a couple of them - L'Italiana and Mama's - is fantastic. We tried the calzones - I think they were the best I've ever had. We tried the Baked Spaghetti and Mama's spinach calzones. I don't know why we would go anywhere else for pizza or calzones unless we're out of town! 
We have only gotten take-out so far but look forward to eating in next time we go out."}
{"text":"Great staff and yummmmmmy food! But this place is growing out of its self needs a new SPOT ASAP! Tried to go a few times but there was a wait and very crowded inside. 

They should move into a lager place ill go more often"}
{"text":"This is going to sound like a review that the owner would write himself, but that's how good it is.
The food, especially Mama Spinato's spinach calzone and Mama Spinatos Pizza, is delicious.
The staff is great too, all really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"After moving to Arizona from the east coast over a year ago, I've finally found somewhere in the valley to get really great pizza. This place is the best!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.

The sausage is excellent. What I like the most about it is that as the pizza cools at the table it still tastes superb. We used to go to Grimal**, but their pizzas gets too cold at the table and loose their appeal. I like the sweetness of the Spinato sauce.

We took our newborn their one time and they gave us a free mini T-shirt for the baby!

I always go during lunch because I've heard the crowds get out of hand on the weekend."}
{"text":"Excellent service. My wife is very very picky but out server was very helpful! Decent pizza.  Light on the sauce but very tasty. They do have have gluten free beer that is amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious food in a family environment! Whats there not to love? We left with a smile on our face and lots of pizza :)"}
{"text":"A awesome pizza place in a funny place. It's location is kinda funny but don't be discouraged. The Italian Bread with marinara sauce is to die for. The pizza is superb. Make sure to save for desert. I recommend the brownie bella."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza and calzone I've had in the entire state!  There is stuff spaghetti calzone and sausage is really amazing!  environment is extremely comfortable I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!! Best in the valley! 

Ive never eaten inside the restaurant- it seems pretty small and cumbersome. We've only called for carry-out.

Sausage and cheese pizza. You will die and be happy just having that once in your life. Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in the valley, and their Chicago-style pizza is better than pizza I've had in Chicago! Their signature sauce is on the sweet side which I like because it reminds me of my mom's home-made sauce. I usually prefer thin crust pizza, but their deep dish here is delish as well. My sis loves the spaghetti calzone with ricotta- word to the wise the small is actually pretty large. Great- now I'm craving some Spinato's! Now that's amore :)!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were excited to try after hearing a lot of good things about it. When we walked in we were greeted with a wonderful smell, the restaurant definitely has a good feel, there was a pretty long wait but that's to be expected with the size of the restaurant in a busy part of Tempe so we're okay with it. after we got seated we ordered the garlic bread with melted mozzarella cheese, it was fantastic and we were very eager to try our pizza. Wish I could say the euphoria lasted. the pizza was not great, not saying it was gross, but it was basically just a fancy Totino's pizza. not unpleasant just not what it promised to be. if you love totinos give it a try you may find that it is right up your alley, but it was really just a big disappointment and it did not live up to the hype for us."}
{"text":"I tried Spinato's last Friday.  I ordered a Large Thin Crust Pepperoni, a Medium Thin Signature Fresh Spinach, and Going Greek Side Salad to go. As warned by other yelp reviews, the sauce they use on the pizza is little sweet.... A little sweeter than I guess I had been expecting. Other than that I thought they were okay."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place needs a review...I think everyone knows it's a great place to get pizza! We live within walking distance from the 12th ST/Glendale location so we are bummed they are going to 7th ST/Missouri...BUT we will still go there. We get take out anyways. I like that they offer gluten free pizza and I really don't mind that it's the smaller size bcs my husband gets a regular crust pizza anyways. He gets sausage and pepperoni (anywhere, everywhere). I get Hawaiian with jalapeno! So good! They have messed up our order a couple times and they always make it right and are really nice about it. It's the sauce! I don't know, it's the perfect mix if tangy-ness and sweetness. We even like it better than the other place that's on the other corner. We like them too but Spinatos rocks! I've never had anything on the menu but pizza and salad so not sure about their other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is officially my favorite thin crust pizza. I really enjoy their pizza and can't wait to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The Tempe location is a little isolated but the food and service are great."}
{"text":"Spinatos rocks. End of story. I'm a pizza snob and they really make a great zah. If you are from Chicago? You'll always be biased but I'm telling you, try Spinatos. Excellent pie...."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today and it was all around amazing. Excellent service and the food was amazing. Highly recommend any of their pizzas, the garlic bread with cheese, and the spaghetti calzone. The cannoli was also really delicious too! The waitress (Maria) serving us really made us feel welcome and was happy to give us her recommendation on what we should order. You can tell the employees there really care about the restaurant!"}
{"text":"awesome pizza. it's kind of tucked away. there's time when i'm craving Spinato's pizza, not just any pizza."}
{"text":"The beat hole in the wall place! Pretty busy...had about a 25min wait well worth it! Our waiter was goooood; not his first rodeo, had a side Greek salad every bite had flavor! We also had pizza WHOA! Yes! Party in my mouth!! And the cannoli best ever!!!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place in Phoenix for pizza. I discovered Spinato's years ago when I still lived in Tempe/Mesa and my then-current girlfriend took me to their original Spinato's location on Smith, which is hidden away in an industrial park. Despite the obscure, hard-to-find location (even when you've been there before, it's very easy to drive right by it), this place is ALWAYS busy.There is nothing else around there to draw in business, at least not after all the industrial park offices close at 5pm. That is how good it is.

I live in the Dreamy Draw area now and I get my Spinato's fix from their 12th St and Glendale location. My all time favorite is their sausage pizza. The cheese is very, very good. They make their own Italian sausage. There is something about the sauce OMG it is SO good, slightly sweet. As others wrote, this is Chicago thin-crust-style pizza, cut into squares. Oh, and the crust is so good too. I'm not gai for Chicago pizza but I just love Spinato's.

Every single person - and I mean, EVERY SINGLE ONE - I have ever taken to Spinato's, they love it and they go back for more and introduce their friends to it. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Nello's gets lots of props in Phoenix but I promise you, Spinato's is better than Nello's."}
{"text":"We called to place a delivery order just 15 mins before closing on Sunday night, and they were so delightful! Ordered a large half spinach and half special 6, along with a side order of meatballs.  The time quoted was ~ 1 hr, which was fine with us.  The pizza was at our door in 1/2 the time! Bonus points for that.

The pizza was hot, but the crust was a little limp, not crispy. It may have been from sitting in the box?  Good quality toppings. Be prepared to be assaulted by the amount of garlic that is on the spinach pizza! They are definitely generous with it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the sauce is different from your typical joint - it's sweet. I'm not sure how I felt about it, but I ended up eating a bunch of it, so it's not  bad, it's just a surprise.  The special 6 was awesome! 

Meatball order came with 3, and covered with sauce. It was very beefy, and good sized. Enjoyed that as well.

Overall, prompt service with better-than-expected pizza.  Maybe add some wings on the menu? Pretty please?"}
{"text":"Rocks. Good pizza, delivered right to the hotel. Can't recommend any better than that!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in the East Valley.
Chicago style pizza with a unique sweet sauce. A must try. You will be addicted after the first bite. 
If you're looking to eat at home, you can either take a cooked pizza home, or they'll make the pizza for you to take it home and cook there.
Seating can be an issue during rush hours. Can be cramped at times. It's a small shop in an industrial park and they have found some creative ways to do seating. 
Can be hard to find but if you're on the right street, keep looking, you'll get there."}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I am completely disappointed with this place. After hearing tons of good reviews from yelpers and friends I was ecstatic to try it. I am not a fan of sweet pizza sauce so that was my first problem.  Secondly, it's very difficult to find and it took forever! I don't want to give this place a completely bad rep though because it is definitely for a certain \"pizza type.\""}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, with lots of variety and options.  One of the better pizza options in the Valley of the Sun.  Solid service, too."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. We are from Chicago and are always on the hunt for Chicago style pizza. We had the Chicago thin crust pizza. Tasted great but would have preferred it a little crispier. But overall very good.   Maybe I'm picky... But  the lighting was a little too bright for me. We will definitely be returning here."}
{"text":"The pizza here is great! We ordered the Super Six on regular crust and the Margherita on thin crust. Unfortunately they delivered the super six on thin crust. It was still good but with all the heavy toppings it would have been nice to have a thicker crust to support all the toppings. Other than that it was great for our first time trying it."}
{"text":"Great pizza, fast delivery and friendly staff. Couldn't ask for more. Though I have to say it is off the beaten path in what looks like an industrial building. But a great place none the less."}
{"text":"We had been hearing rave reviews about this pizza and yelp has the reviews to back up what we were hearing.  The staff is super friendly.  One of the best things about this pizza place is that when there is a line to be seated you can pre order your pie so when you sit down you wait for food is very short.  It is a pretty efficient way to get patrons in and out.

On to the food.  Started with the 1/2 and 1/2 dinner salad.  The Italian dressing was just ok for me, but there was nothing wrong with it.  The 1/2 of spinach was non existent.  The pie showed up shortly after the salad was consumed.  My biggest complaint about the pie was the sweet sauce.  So sweet in fact that I had to add salt to try to cut the sweetness.  Defiantly not my favorite pie."}
{"text":"Ordered due to reviews, price was excessive.  I was excited as they had chicken sausage, but honestly was disappointed.

Pizza was ok, but not worth the $35 is cost me."}
{"text":"The margherita pizza is as good or better than Four Peaks! WARNING: IF YOU LIKE THIN CRUST, DON'T ORDER 7\"  !!!!   
For some reason, they can't make the crust thin on those little pizzas. All other sizes  are very thin and nicely crisp. That is the way I like mine...thin and crisp!!
This review is only for their 11\"+ thin crust pizza's."}
{"text":"So good!!!  They ran out of thick crust, but I was more than satisfied with the spinach special and chicago special (sausage, onions and bell peppers).  As other reviewers noted, the sauce is pretty sweet, but I do like sweets.  The spinach pizza was covered with delicious roasted garlic, and both came out piping hot.  

The spaghetti calzone appetizer was interesting and very good.  Because the pizzas were thin crust and covered with toppings, I needed some bread or pasta to balance it all out.  The pasta filled calzone was a good foil.

The gelato was a little sandy, but the cannoli was pretty good.  I came here for pizza, not dessert, so I don't mind.

Oh, the restaurant is located in a quiet little plaza, and the wait time was 25 minutes on a Saturday night.  There was a good-sized wine and beer menu, and the inside feels like an old Italian kitchen.  Service was wonderful."}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent however customer service means more to me. The girl either didn't want to be working today or just was not into helping 100%."}
{"text":"One of the best 'za joints in the PHX. 

No corkage and BYOB so the pizza wont be the only thing that is deliciously sauced... cheesy... my pun not the pizza... well the pizza too. 

Both the thick crust and thin crust are amazing, i prefer the thin. Large sausage, onions, and shrooms with a few cheap bottles from Safeway across the street = a night of fun for all your friends.  I have NO idea what people are hattin' on the 'nato's for, it is nearly perfect pizza. They also have great huge grilled sandwiches and fresh salads."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find this was for me!   Here I had no idea this place was even here.
It is tucked away down a side Street near Tempe Market place.
I really wanted some good Italian Food. I feel like I can never find good Pizza in the Valley.  This is it! 
Wonderful, fabulous, just what I wanted Pizza!
The crust is delish, the sauce is awesome.  Nice and Hot , on a cold day. 
I am so looking forward to going back here.
We loved our server as well. Great customer service. I do not think you would ever find it. unless you knew it was there. I am so happy I found it.
Lots of parking all around the lot.
A true simple, and delicious Italian food restaurant. What more could you want??"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have found since moving to Chandler 16 months ago.  Being raised in Chicago and introduced to pizza there, as a very young child, I have a preference for really delicious sausage and cheese with spectacular sauce pizza.  This I found at Spinato's.  Always consistent, always great."}
{"text":"Been a regular ever since they first opened at this location many years ago.. used to see the owner making pizzas all the time. Now it's a large operation.. but still good food. Spinach calazone is my favorite."}
{"text":"Tomato sauce too sweet- tastes like tomato jam.  Chincy toppings- cheese pizza had very little cheese.  Crust has no yeast flavor- tastes like baking soda/powder crust.  Mozzarella had very little cheese flavor.  Chicago pizza- they obviously have never had a Chicago pizza.  Over priced, poor value."}
{"text":"They get a 10 on the pizza! We had a half and half mamas spinach and Nicole's favorite! So yummy! Desert was alright which is why they only get 4 stars. But overall, I would recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"I visited this place over a year ago, and I still remember how weird the location was. It was buried among the warehouses, and kind of hard to find.

Once I found it and got seated, it was all great. I ordered the Pesto Chicken Pizza, and it was glorious. Probably the best pizza I've had."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Tempe! I've only ever had the Signature spinach pizza and the L'Italiana pizza, and haven't been able to branch out past these two.. They're both amazing. Their Greek salad with Italian dressing on the side is also awesome."}
{"text":"Their customer service both on the phone and in person was fantastic.  Their gluten free pizza crust is delish.  And, they deliver.  It doesn't get much better!"}
{"text":"I had the blessed chance to have some wine and pizza at my apartment on a Friday night after a terribly hectic week. Spinato's is a spot that is on my list of places to try in my 'hood. So I called my order in; a large Get Meaty with extra cheese. I went to the store to pick up a bottle of Peachy Canyon Zin, and grabbed my pizza on the way back home. HOLY COW, my pizza was huge! Oh well, I'll have leftovers. It seemed like it took forever to get home because the pizza's aroma wafted through my car and drove me crazy! I got home opened the box, and marveled at the sight of my yummy pizza. The pizza is not sliced into triangles, rather, they are sliced into squares. I grabbed a couple squares and noticed the GREASE that oozed through the cheese on the pizza. Uh oh. I grabbed a few paper towels and firmly patted my pizza. I thought to myself \"This is one greasy pizza! This is going to be awesome!\" I felt guilty and rebellious taking the first bite of my pizza. I was immediately struck by the sweetness of their sauce! It wasn't too terribly sweet, but I must say I like a slightly sweet red sauce. It may catch some people off guard. The meat on the pizza was delicious! The sausage was flavorful and I think it's home-made. I ended up sticking the leftovers in the freezer for future indulgence. We'll see if it's just as tasty later on.

Spinato's offers pasta dishes which I'd like to try as well a garlic bread and antipasti. I look forward to visiting Spinato's again!"}
{"text":"I came here while visiting my sister from California and we came here for dinner. Nick was our server and bartender and he's the absolute best!! We were SO well taken care of and wouldn't want to have been served by anyone else!!"}
{"text":"The thin crust is fine, but the sauce is too sweet. It's the kind of pizza that teenagers will like, but grownups shouldn't settle for."}
{"text":"I went with a friend of mine that I'm visiting, he ranted a raved about this place.  I'm from Yuma so a good Calzone would have been perfect. I'm not impressed since all the meat was in the center and not to the edge, if I wanted cheese bread, I would have ordered that.  The mushrooms and onions were not fully cooked.  Since we own a bakery that was voted #1 for 19 years in a row, I know a little about restaurants.  My friend was embarrassed, the manager did give us 1/2 off the Calzone.  The Caesar side salad was great.  If you order the Chicago Calzone I would get with their sauce at least to dip in, it would be better than the AuJus sauce.  If you come to Yuma try Bernardo's in the foothills you will be glad you did, their steak bomb Stromboli is off the hook."}
{"text":"Update: Recently found out they have gluten free garlic cheese bread. It is the BEST thing I have ever had. I had not had anything like it within 4 years of having to eat gluten free."}
{"text":"Okay I don't give 5's because I like some range,or headroom in my reviews, but if I WERE to give a 5...This place is great. The antipasto is wonderful (esp the artichoke hearts), square sliced pizza incredible and the pistachio gelato divine.   I was with a native Chicago biz associate who said the side dish of hot Giardiniera, spicy veggies which you put on the pizza is very Chicago . This place is a gem. There are a bunch of Spinato's in the Phx area, this is the original one (no alcohol at this one)."}
{"text":"my personal fave is the spaghetti & meatball calzone - YUM!

the restaurant is casual and b.y.o.b. which makes it good for families and/or groups. delivery is limited to a small area and can take awhile. 

secret hint: they put sugar in the sauce.. no wonder it's so darn good!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food! Their happy hour food menu is top notch as well! We ordered the bruschetta, spaghetti calzone, and the Caesar and Greek salad. The bruschetta was amazing, with balsamic and yellow t"}
{"text":"The staff here is the best! They are flexible and attentive.  I rarely go to manager and complement the staff but this place is the best! Oh, and Spinatos pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"We had the thin crust pizza with sausage and ham, and it was very good.  It was very, very greasy, though.  Possibly the greasiest pizza I've ever had.  Cut down on the grease factor and it would have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"So amazing tucked on a side street.  Wish I knew about it sooner.  Had the spaghetti calzone.  Delicious.  Greek salad and two pizzas were great too.  Service was outstanding.  Quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza. We ordered the 7\" personal size custom toppings ! The red sauce was the best I have ever had. On the sweeter side but amazing . Crust was perfect fairly thin and crispy . I loved it."}
{"text":"I've always loved spinach on my pizza, but my typical complaint at other places was the tiny amount that was used.  NOT SO AT SPINATO'S.  This spinach loving pizza fan was in HEAVEN!  

This was honestly the best pizza that I've had in a while...thin light crust, tasty tomato sauce, cooked to perfection.

We also got the anti-pasta salad, and their house Italian dressing was awesome.  

My only complaint was the lack of alcohol.  Would have loved a nice glass of wine to go with the supper yummy pizza."}
{"text":"Some like their sweet sauce some love it!  These guys are different than any other pizza in the valley.  Their toppings are premium and their sauce is my personal favorite.  Hands down my favorite Italian Sausage put on a pizza.  They are generous with toppings and they are consistent.  Every pizza is as good as the next.

They also have something that everyone should try.  It may sound unusual, but you'll be a believer after trying it.  The Spaghetti and Meatball calzone!!!  Get it with the ricotta (they have fresh ricotta, not that cheap dry garbage most places use).   It comes covered in sauce and is amazing!  

I can't say enough good things about these guys, really great people, really great pizza!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there yesterday. Pizza was fantastic.  Service was as well. I'm definitely going back. My wife will love it since they have a gluten free option also. Ingredients were very fresh."}
{"text":"This place sucks.  We have been there 2 times, with an attempted 3rd time.  1st time, burnt pizza, was horrible.  2nd time, we were told that it would be a 15 minute wait, we waited 1 hour 15 minutes, then it took 1 hour and 20 minutes for them to bring us the wrong pizza.  Last time, we called and were told no wait, showed up 3 minutes later and found out there was an 1 and 1/2 hour wait.  They told us it was standard practice to tell any person that calls is there is no wait.  Won't go back.  Florencias, Nellos and Grimaldies all have better Pizza."}
{"text":"Skip Oregano's, especially the crazy wait during season, and come here for truly amazing pizza sauce. This is a small family place, affordable and quite good. Took my family and we were all happily surprised."}
{"text":"Easily some of the best pizza I've ever had. It's been a while since I've tasted pizza that stood out as tasting different. Spinato's has a unique crust mixed with a delicious sauce and fresh cheese. Can't wait to try other toppings. I had the pepperoni with fresh oregano. Price was very reasonable for the quality. I ate in and the service was good. Joint was clean too. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is D-Lish!!! I've been here several times and have never been dissatisfied. Things I love about Spinato's:
The Nicole pizza: soooo yummy
Cesar salad: that giant crispy cheese thing with it 
Calzones: all of them. They're huge
Bryce: best server ever
Stuffed mushrooms: very rich"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!  

The food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.

OK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! 

:(  Now I have no more left :(

Unfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*"}
{"text":"Mama Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach Pizza is one of the most perfect meals you can find in the Valley.

Spinato's sauce is really what hits the spot. It's slightly sweet. The fresh garlic on this pizza catches you by surprise and keeps you coming back for more.

If I could give Spinato's an extra star, I would. And it would be for the following: If you eat in the restaurant, the pizzas are served on top of a cooling rack, on top of a pizza pan. This ensures proper air circulation to the crust. By the time you get to that last slice of pizza (and trust me, there will be no leftovers to speak of) the crust still holds up to the pile of fresh spinach which sits atop it!

I know it's in a seemingly bland industrial park, but I promise you that there is nothing bland about the food. This will be a family favorite for as long as it exists."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this pizza was DELICIOUS!!  We had spinach and sausage and my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I wish there was one a little closer to home (Gilbert) but it is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"It's really with mixed emotions that I award five stars...best pizza for miles, but I kinda want to keep it secret! There's no red sauce that compares to Spinato's. The Spaghetti Calzone will make you unthink what you may about calzones in general. Everything here is downright craveable."}
{"text":"Well sadly I have been forced to change my view of Spinato's.  April 3, 2013 I did my weekly visit to the restaurant to enjoy pizza and drinks with some friends.  In walks a young man and a young woman who were set at the table just next to me a few feet.  On his waist band was a 9 MM pistol.  I am fully for gun rights, as I own one as well, however what I am not for is eating dinner in a family establishment with loaded handguns strapped to other patron's waists.  Every one with in distance of the gun (which had a significant clip attached to it) asked why he felt he needed it in the restaurant.  What we all concluded was this establishment must not be safe if he feels it is necessary to arm himself as he did.  Spinato's allowed this man to carry this in to their establishment as under Arizona law they could choose to keep them out.  I loved you Spinato's, but I simply don't feel comfortable sitting three feet from a random stranger who is armed to the hilt and could take every one out in a matter of minutes.  

I think it is fair to say we can all enjoy your pizza without a 50 clip strapped to our waists.  Or is your establishment so unsafe I should arm myself next time I come?  Unfortunately, I won't ever take the chance again.  I DEFINITELY will miss you...

(I changed my rating from 5 to 3...the food I give a 5, the environment I now give a 1---makes 3 a good compromise)."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! 5 stars this is the best pizza I have ever had. We got the signature pizza which was no mistake. Not only was the pizza fantastic, the staff was too. Super friendly environment, a homie yet professional feel. Great just so very Great."}
{"text":"It was really good! Even my picky 11yr old liked it, and asked for seconds. Well go back again."}
{"text":"I used yelp to find this restaurant and I'm grateful for the reference. Started with the meatball appetizer and it was delicious. Nice flavor in the meatballs,good texture, lots of cheese and the marinara sauce was delicious. I could eat just the sauce with a spoon. The thin crust pizza was also great. We built our own with sausage, mushrooms, banana peppers and ricotta and my only complaint was I was too full to finish. I'm from out of town so next time I return I will be sure to save room for more pizza from Spinato's."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best Pizza in Arizona. Tops on my list in the nation. The sweet sauce blends perfectly with their delicious crust. I love this place."}
{"text":"From the husband (native Chicagoan):  \"I've not had pizza this good west of St. Louis.\" That said, he had some notes, but who cares? If you are in Phoenix and looking for good Chicago pizza, try Spinato's. I had the \"half and half, double meat and cheese antipasto salad,\" which was excellent. We also ordered a spinach and sausage thin crust pizza--also excellent. Also, they delivered to the Hilton Squaw Peak hotel on 16th St."}
{"text":"\"Max A'\"  brought up some good points about Spinato's. The ingredients-under-the-cheese is a little odd, and the crust is unnecessarily messy.

That said, I'm still a fan. I never had sweet pizza sauce before trying Spinato's, but it's good, and theirs is very fresh. 

What motivated me to write this review wasn't the pizza, though. Their calzone's are awesome! Especially the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone. That one only comes in one size, but it's perfect. 

Like other's wrote, the building is kinda hidden. It's about a one block south of University, and the door faces north. 

And I think Spinato's is still BYOB."}
{"text":"My sister has been telling me to check this place out forever now. I'm glad I did! Ordered a personal pepperoni pizza and it was delicious.  The cheese was just right and that sweet sauce completes it. I got the thin crust which was a little thicker than I'm use to but still good. Rarely does restaurants  have RO (reverse osmosis) water, the water tastes clean and fresh which is probably why their crust taste bomb. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is delicious. Their big mama spinach pie is so good it's almost wrong. Their red sauce is sweet, like your typical Chicago pies, and it's actually for sale at this location along with their vodka sauce. This location is teeny tiny so I suggest carry out. People are so friendly and super nice. They get crazy busy but never let that get them down. If you've never been here, go. The only reason they lost one star was because their estimated pickup times have been at least a half an hour off, last time an entire hour, which was rather annoying, especially considering there's no room to stand and wait"}
{"text":"This pizza has been around for years. The family started the original place under the name Aurelio's in the early 1980's. It was in Tempe as well but different location was off McDowell. The pizza over the years has been consistently good. The owners are awesome and friendly.  I am recommending for those going for the first time to try the Spinato's spinach pizza or the all meat pizza. I would start with an antipasto salad and then dive into the pizza! Delicioso! Currently have to BYOB/BYOW but process of getting a liquor license as of 10/2010."}
{"text":"Best pizza I had in a long time. Two things make a good pizza, the crust and the sauce. Spinato's hit the mark on both. I couldn't stop eating."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I freaking LOVE Spinatos. I've been a handful of times and always forget how much I love it. I wanted some pizza yesterday so we decided to shoot up here. it's in a strip mall, but don' t let that fool  you. This place is the REAL DEAL when it comes to great pizza in the Valley. Their specialty is this marinated spinach and tomato pizza and it's awesome. WE opted to each order our own personal pizza, that's around $7 and comes with the perfect amount of pizza for one person. I went with the Super Six: pepperoni, sausage, ham, mushrooms, onions and peppers. Wifey went with the spinach special with ricotta, which was another  fifty cents, no biggie. My daughter always gets the kids cheese ravioli, $4. The service is fantastic, just a real small restaurant feel.  Get there early, it gets crowded. On Wednesdays ,they have half off bottles of wine..score!"}
{"text":"Went here in the middle of the week and there was a line outside the place to pick up to go orders and the dining room had about a 30 minute wait so they are really busy and I can see why. I got a Nicole's new favorite pizza here and it was one of the best pizza I have had in Phoenix. I love this place and plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is one of those places you must try if you are not an AZ resident. 
I live close enough to Spinato's that it is a downfall if I have a pizza craving!
So far every pizza I have tried has been delicious! They are reasonably quick considering they business they pull in! For the quality they bring I would say they are affordable. 
The only somewhat negative thing I can say is that their red sauce is a bit on the sweet side so if you are not a fan of that, watch out!"}
{"text":"Spinato's Pizza is so good that I honestly can't enjoy any other pizza place anymore because they've raised my standards. If you know a place that has better pizza and you've actually tried a few of Spinato's menu items, please message me."}
{"text":"My husband told me this is the best pizza he's ever had! I was really impressed with the sweet sauce especially. We ordered a medium specialty pizza and had enough slices left for lunch the next day.

Everyone was friendly, and the place is clean. Very cute and small inside.

We used the GPS to get us there quickly with no problems."}
{"text":"It doesn't get better than this.

This is my absolute favorite pizza place in the Phoenix area. I hate waiting for a table, but it's always worth it.

If you are a regular, you might even get special treatment from the staff.

I highly recommend pepperoni with extra cheese. Yum!"}
{"text":"I joined Yelp because of this place!  We saw lots of positive reviews while we did a staycation at nearby Pointe Hilton.  We weren't disappointed.  I don't think pizza will ever be the same in my eyes again.  I had the L'Italiana and it was incredible.  Great sauce, awesome crust and the roasted red peppers and spinach were delicious as well.  It dawned on me later that I just ate a pizza without any meats on it and my inner-carnivore wasn't even mad.  I wish there was a closer location for future cravings!"}
{"text":"Oh my heck, this is THE BEST pizza EVER!  The homemade Italian sausage is ambrosia!!  If you go you MUST try the sausage.....  The sweet, homemade sauce compliments it perfectly.  Oh, I drool thinking about this pizza.....   TRY IT!!  you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to get a pizza to go. Limited but quality menu. Their sauce has sugar in it so you will be hooked in no time! Don't forte to grab a package of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies! You will thank me later!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! I like the personal size with mushroom and sausage for lunch. Closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Spinato's is a hip little Chicago style pizza joint located between industrial complexes just south of Tempe Marketplace. It's like a hole-in the wall, but once inside, you're treated to high ceiling, brick wall, cute music, trendy art, and romantic lighting. The seating is limited but there's a back room and willingness to hold a large party. I've never been here where seating was an issue, so I think they have adequate space.

I've been here twice, once with a large group for lunch (6+), and once with a small group for dinner (5). It was comfortable, inviting, and the food tasted very good. The desert was also tasty. The pizza takes a little while to come out but it's well worth the wait.

The environment makes this place a 5. It's very inviting. The waitress was having her first day and was still a sweetheart and split a check 3 ways. The other time, we just got great, consistent service. They also have crushed ice, if that means anything to you. It's so good! Huge cups.

The location is funny, but there's plenty of parking. It is easy to miss if you're going north, but easy to see if you're going south. It's in a complex with a lot of industrial business, so there's sufficient, clearly marked parking.

You'll have a good time. Perfect for a date."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and service. For a small place, this restaurant was busy! Enjoyed the pizza immensely, but I enjoyed the garlic bread appetizer even more. Definitely a great place to bring your family. We did not have any leftovers to bring home. The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the state of the bathroom.. but to be fair it was a men and women shared bathroom and I wonder if that was part of the reason."}
{"text":"Had the \"combo\" pizza, and it was great. Our waiter was friendly. Spinatos, by far one of the best pizza places around."}
{"text":"I have been slacking that is for sure on the reviews.  I think late is better than never.  

I have always loved Spinatos.  There food has always been consistent.  The only thing that comes to mind was when the kid tried to fit left over slices in to a box that was made for half the amount he stuffed into it. LOL

This trip was for a quick dinner.  I had the personal peperoni and sausage.  I think I had a appetizer that was on sale too.  The pizza was good.  Love this place and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while checking out the Cubs Spring Training facility.  We were a little surprised that it's in an Industrial Complex, but decided what the heck, let's try it. So glad we did, the pizza was fantastic! Ordered the Italian Combo, the sauce was amazing and the pizza was loaded with sausage, peppers and onions. The server told us that this is their original location, established 40 years ago. Will definitely come again and look forward to checking out their other locations."}
{"text":"Been searching two years for a good thin-crust pizza...found it!!  The vegetarian pizza is divine!!  Love it."}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni pizza after a long day of moving (so anything should have tasted good), but the sauce was disgustingly sweet. We both gave up after a couple of slices. I'm not sure I've ever had a pepperoni pizza that I stopped eating while still hungry :("}
{"text":"After living in AZ for 4 years I finally found a pizza joint worth going to. Spinatos is a great place to get some authentic Chicago style pizza. We got a large thin crust pizza and it was delicious. We also got an order of Caesar salad which was great. Took about 30 minutes for our order to be filled. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"We ate here while in town for a long weekend. OMG this place is incredible.  It's tucked in what looks like an industrial park...and may be a little hard to find. But ooooh is it worth it. OMG we ate there in March and still talk about how great the pizza was.  The sauce...omg the sauce, we wanted to drink it, it was soooo good.  The boys shared the \"Get Meaty\", while I had the Signature Fresh Spinach ...oh my.  The staff was very friendly.  The host at the door was awesome. We were in with a table on a busy Saturday night in 1/3 of the time he quoted us.  We were thrilled. Definitely recommend !!!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time this evening. Cute place with a nice, clean cozy atmosphere. Friendly staff, but not overly helpful. The cheesy garlic bread was incredible - YUMM! My only complaint is the actual pizza. We got the thicker crust and it tasted really dry and hard. The pizza sauce is also way too sweet. It tasted more like a dessert some bites. They put so much sauce on the pizza that you can't get around tasting the sweetness (underneath and on top of the actual toppings). Too sweet for me, but maybe you're into that? Decent price ($30 for three, all got sodas, medium pizza and app to share).

Overall I wouldn't go again, but would recommend to someone who likes sweet saucy pizza."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD. YES.

It's scary how good their pizza is... literally melts in your mouth.

And now they deliver in my area. I'm in trouble!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and service! This is a popular place and now we know why. Although they were really busy we were warmly greeted by the hostess who gave our 20 month old daughter a little red Spinatos tee shirt which she wore the entire night. Our server was super engaging but not over bearing. The pizza is delicious! Totally worth the stop if you are craving pizza in the Tempe area."}
{"text":"Wow, I was really impressed with this pizza. Not surprising they have so many locations scattered throughout the Valley. 

The sauce is what really sets this place apart from other places I have tried. It has a distinct sweetness to it that was really subtle and enjoyable (I prefer spicier sauces usually). Topped the pizza with fresh basil and it really complemented the sauce well. 

In the past I've always gotten the Mama Signature pizza, which is topped with spinach, garlic, and Roma tomatoes. I've had it many times before, but as my boyfriend pointed out, it does seem to get a little soggy.

This time around, went for a pepperoni & sausage, half topped with garlic and half topped with fresh basil. The garlic half was great, but the basil was definitely a better choice. It wasn't too greasy, and the sausage (hand torn chunks) was really good. The thin crust had a great flavor and held up until the very last piece.

They also give you little cups of red pepper and parmesan. The parmesan was surpringly fresh and flavorful. I don't normally bother with it."}
{"text":"So the parental units call me up on Sunday and ask me if I want to meet them at this place they love called Spinato's. The catch, I have to meet them in a 1/2 hour coming from Scottsdale. 

Normally this wouldn't be a big issue, but I took lounging to a whole new level on Sunday, and I was looking pretty bedraggled. I quickly looked up Spinato's on Yelp, since my parents have been known to be hit or miss on some eateries. All great reviews, which made me really want to try it. 

The lure of a free dinner, (and seeing my mom) put my unshowered butt in gear! So I hopped in the car 15 minutes later looking slightly scary. Unfortunately, I couldn't wear a hat inside the restaurant, or I would have. 

Turns out it didn't really matter what I looked like anyway. At 5 PM on Sunday the crowd was right out of Cocoon, before they got in that pool! One lady even had her oxygen tank with her. I found myself wishing I could try it. I kept wondering if I breathed in that oxygen for a while, would I get some kind of wonderful, natural high???

The place was packed, and it turns out those geriatrics really know their stuff. The food was great!

We did the whole dinner family style. The antipasto salad with spinach was amazingly perfect, really the best I've ever had.  The garlic bread was deliciously, warm, garlicky, and crunchy all at once. The marinara sauce to dip it is was slightly sweet, but not in an obnoxious way. It was just the right counter balance to the garlic.

The pizza itself was decent, not great, but decent. This is probably because I prefer thinner crust, and minimal cheese on the pizza, such as Grimaldi's, but that didn't keep me from eating it. It didn't keep me from having it for lunch the next day either! 

I will definitely be back for the antipasto salad with spinach & the garlic bread. I need to cut back on the pizza anyway. Oh, and the service was amazing. I don't even think we had one wait person. Anybody you asked for something immediately brought it to you! Seriously, nothing phased them. Love it, and hopefully I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The BEST pizza. Every time I come here I am never disappointed! The baked spaghetti calzone is super delicious and I think should be tried by all. And not to mention the pizza is so amazing the sauce used is so sweet and delightful!"}
{"text":"Good! 5/5 for food and 3/5 for service.

We had family visiting from out of town who wanted to experience some really good Phoenix pizza - we had been to the Scottsdale Spinato's, but not this one, and decided to try it. Between all of us, we got a medium \"Other Signature,\" personal Chicken Presto Pesto and medium Nicole's Favorite for pizzas, a family-sized Caesar salad, and an entree-sized strawberry gorgonzola salad. It was the perfect amount of food for seven people. My personal favorite was the Other Signature, but the pizzas were all really good. The Caesar and strawberry gorgonzola salads were pretty standard. The Caesar was an appetizer for all the pizza eaters in the group, but the strawberry gorgonzola salad was for my mother-in-law, and she wished she got pizza.

The service was kind of weird - our server left twice in the middle of taking our order, and didn't even ask one of us what he wanted. She also abandoned us and never came back after the initial ordering process. We had to grab other people when we needed water, and the bill was impossible to chase down."}
{"text":"Ordering was a bit odd.  You would think with technology these days they can google your address.  The Pizza was here 20 mins early and it was excellent! We ordered three pizzas for 10 people it was perfect!  Old Chicago, spicy Italian and combo was awesome! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love it. 6 stars - at least. Great service from everyone. Server, manager, hostess. Great pizza. I'm a bit of pizza snob and I really like this pizza. And I think it's a great value. 2 adults, 2 kids - when the check came I truly felt it was a great deal. We've been twice and it's instantly become a favorite. Signature Spinach extra crispy - love the garlic - so good."}
{"text":"Hello. 

This is my second review, and of Spinatos Pizza. 

First, the restaurant has a fantastic atmosphere and plays great music. Oldies but goodies. 

Major turn off is the choice of Pepsi products instead of Coke. \"No, Pepsi is not ok. How about if I fucked your wife.\"

For the appetizer I had garlic bread with Mozzarella. It was fantastic. The side marinara sauce was to die for.  Overall 5/5

The pizza was cheesy goodness. With Canadian bacon, diced garlic and onions the pizza was the best I've had in Tempe. Extremely high rate. Overall 4.5/5

The dessert was a brownie Bella. \"Homemade brownie, salted caramel, and chocolate sauces with choice of gelatos.\" At an affordable $3.95 it  can't be beat. Best dessert I've had at a restaurant. Overall 5/5

Restaurant rating: 5/5. 

A definite go to if you are in the mood for high quality Italian food. 

Thanks for reading. 

Until next time."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Phoenix!!! Sweet tasting sauce with fresh ingredients. Friendly staff. Not a big place and not a lot of parking but the wait time is not a problem. Best secret in the valley. My favorite place!"}
{"text":"How is it that I've lived in Phoenix for 19 years and I've never been to Spinato's?  This place is fabulous!  Upon arrival there was a short wait but definitely worth it.  We started off with the garlic bread as an appetizer.  It was THE best...an explosion of flavors in your mouth!  If you don't try it, you're missing out.

We decided on a 14\" thin crust pizza.  Menu claims it feeds 2-3 people. We were a party of two so I figured this would be adequate.  We ended up taking the majority of the pizza home because there was a lot left over.  Ummm, leftovers!  Next time we'll opt for a smaller size.  

The service was impeccable.  Brittany, our server, was beyond cordial.  She checked on us at least five times  to make sure our needs were met.

Overall, best pizza I've had in Phoenix.  Better than Pizzeria Bianco (in my opinion) and you don't have to deal with the average three hour wait.

Prices are fair.  For the appetizer, 14\" pizza and two drinks, it was only $23.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is easily in my list of top 5 pizza places of all time! 

The combination of a thin crust, their sweet sauce, and generous amount of toppings makes it delicious. 

Recommend the Super Six for meat lovers and the Mama Spinach as a vegetarian option."}
{"text":"This is the VERY BEST Pizza in town! We have eaton at Spinato's for 5 plus years and never a bad meal and the service is always with a smile!"}
{"text":"Three words: gluten free pizza. 

At a reasonable price, too!

I have eaten at Spinato's many times before, but it has been a few years as I have given up gluten (protein in wheat). Mentioning that I miss pizza at dinner yesterday, a new friend noted that Spinato's had gluten-free pizza! I was so happy to hear they added it to their menu. 

Tonight for dinner, I ordered a 10\" gluten free pizza with pepperoni, feta cheese, and diced garlic for $12.90 (pick up). It was bigger than 10\" and was so delicious! Much better than the pathetic excuse for a pizza they serve at Streets of New York. I am definitely coming back here soon to order all the pizza I've missed out on these last few years."}
{"text":"The husband and I had a \"staycation\" at the Buttes resort for the weekend and spent our lazy Sunday day drinking by the pool.  After several or more margaritas....Needless to say, I felt a little hungover by 4pm...I was starving and had that weird hungover feeling in my stomach..Since he promised me pizza, I found this place on Yelp and we decided to give it a try (March 22nd).  I walked in seriously hangry and ready to eat; luckily we were seated right away.  We ordered the cheese garlic bread with marinara sauce and it was verrry good.  Crispy, cheesy, and the sauce was really good.  I could have ate the entire thing, but I had to share.  For the pizza we had the gluten free thin crust with pep and sausage.  it was EXCELLENT.  At first bite, I was thrown off by the sauce.  It has a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting.  The first few bites I didn't think the pizza was anything special...It was super hot, yet I was trying to scarf it down...(not a good look, but I was desperate)  And then, it happened.  After I finished my first piece, I realized I loved everything about this pizza.  I pretty much eat pizza any chance I get, good or bad. But this...This was some epic ish happening in my pizza world. The crust was perfect thin crust.  The sauce, hearty, with a hint of sweetness that tastes like it came from tomatoes that have roasted and roasted...and then roasted some more into perfect deep flavored marinara.  The sausage was zesty and italiany.  I've been craving it ever since...Unfortunately, we live a pretty good distance from this place, so it's not exactly close.  If it was I would be a regular.  Until next time Spinato's...."}
{"text":"Seriously yummy pizza ! So far best we've found out here and we are from chicago!
We also had thir strawberry salad which was good. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a pizzeria in Tempe.  Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach pizza is one of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Good luck finding the place on the first try as there is no signage showing where they are. The parking lot is not lit at night so it is extremely dark; would be nice if they had a take out parking space by the entrance. One night I came in to pick up a pizza and had a hard time pulling in as there were some guys at the lot entrance throwing a football around...they stared at me weird as I drove past them.
Pizzas and calzones are good. Thought the side Caesar salad (take out) was pricey at $4.
For takeout once in a while it's ok."}
{"text":"After about 5 failed attempts at finding a pizza joint worth the money we were invited to Spinato's.  The only thing negative I have to say is that our service was not great.  The watier seemed way \"too cool\" for his job.  My daughter never got her meatballs.  When she finally did, 20 minutes after the pizza, they were free.  But still, she was hungry.  The service didn't take away from the fact that the pizza was SOOOO cheesey and delicisous.  I love the cross cutting style.  I can't decribe it any other way than utter cheesy goodness.  If you love your pizza cheesy and gooey and messy..this is the place for you.  If you are in the mood for whole wheat, less cheese and health pizza...find somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The pizza is absolutely amazing! I love anything spicy so I added the peppers with pepperoni! It was the best pizza ever! The staff is extremely friendly and didn't feel rushed to move along after our meal because they were packed! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great pizza!"}
{"text":"I discovered good ole' Spinato's a few years back and I completely fell in love!  

I usually opt to have the \"oh so delicious\" Baked Spaghetti Calzone.  I only get the petite size because that alone is HUGE.  It is cooked to perfection with a sweet tasting Italian sauce.  

This is one place, I usually like to introduce to people!  I've got to spread the word on the great mom and pop food places!"}
{"text":"Great \"Chicago\" style pizza.  There is one in Tempe, that pretty much only serves pizza and one in N. Scottsdale (FLW).  Spinach calzones are outstanding.  Tempe is a good place to go for lunch...not really a good first date place.  Just a plain simple place to get a good bite to eat.  Near Mill so that is a plus, if you are down there for an event.  They have some funny hours so call before you go."}
{"text":"YESSSSS!

This place is so good. They have a pretty good happy hour, too. My bf and I usually just share a personal pizza and a salad and we've never been disappointed.

It used to be right around the corner from us, but we'll still travel the 20 minutes here for the quality pizza! Thanks Spinato's! :)"}
{"text":"All I gotta say is their thin crust pizza is so bomb. The sauce they use has so much flavor it makes me want to buy it but then I know I'm too lazy to go home and make a mediocre pizza and waste their awesome sauce on it so I just come in here and eat it :).  

Also their garlic bread is bomb also, a must order with pizza and anything really. Haha. Dining in or Togo its awesome. One of my face pizza places next to al forno on Glendale and 57th ave."}
{"text":"I've got bad news for you. One day, you're gonna' die. 
I've also got good news for you. You're gonna wake up and be standing at the pearly gates. 
The bad news is that they're gonna' be closed. 
The good news is that they more than likely are going to swing wide for you and a choir of heavenly angels will sing as you walk through. 
The bad news is that your Aunt Agnes, who used to like to pinch the crap out of your cheek until she kicked the bucket will be there to greet you. 
The good news is that she's going to hand you a box that says \"Spinato's\" on it. 
You open the box. 
If it's empty, you're in hell.
But more than likely, it's got a piping hot, fresh-made a Mamma Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinash pie. Your piehole will be dripping, and as you lift a piece to your lips, even Aunt Agnes's pinching of your cheek will seem like a blessing. Yeah, it's that good. If they serve pizza in heaven, it's Mamma Spinato's. The good news is you don't have to croak to enjoy it. And they deliver. And it's hot! Manga!
Quick notes: Their \"medium\" is everyone else's large. I did not see their large, but I bet it's manly indeed. Extra star for square cutting the pie. Spinato's is what pizza is ALL about."}
{"text":"good pizza great for th elittle tikes"}
{"text":"Spinato's has the best pizza in the valley. The staff is extremely friendly the only down side to this restaurant is small so waits can be long. Everything I've tried has been great. My personal favorite is the get meaty pizza. All the meats are flavorful and the sauce has a slight sweet taste to it but it isn't overwhelming like a Pizza Hut.  I also recommend ordering a spaghetti calzone with meatballs and ricotta. It will change your life. You can order a small because it is still large enough to have plenty of leftovers."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and a side salad from here to be delivered to the Sleepy Dog Brewery right down the street  while I'm in town for work.

Person taking my order over the phone was friendly and energetic. Pizza took a bit longer than I would've expected to be delivered to a place a mile away, especially since it was a Tuesday night.

The food itself was very good (I had the thin crust Chicago) and I was happy to share it with another patron and staff at the brewery. Would eat there again if I were back in, although may try it out dining in or something."}
{"text":"The first time a friend took me to Spinatos, i thought she was taking me to a chop shop.  Sadly, she couldn't find the place, and neither could I.  
I went back to look for this mythical spot, and was surprised to find the BEST pizza in Phoenix.  
Yes, I said best.  A bit greasy, and it usually leads to a stomach ache afterward, but still #1 in my book.

The best sauce, the best cheese, the best crust.  
Even the Garlic Knots are to die for.

I love that this place is quaint, and hidden.  And I love that it's not so popular that you have to wait to claim one of the 4-5 tables that are in there...

Don't ever leave this location.  I think something about the ambiance makes it a better pizza than their other locations.

Thumbs UP

One request though... try to change your hours to be open 7days a week."}
{"text":"When I walked in the door and saw that the Pizza Oven was one of those conveyor belt ovens I should have gone with my gut feeling and walked away. A real Chicago Pizza is made in an oven with a stone shelf and you need either a pan or peel to get it in and out of the oven.

The hype on the website talks about how the owners wanted to bring Chicago pizza to Phoenix. I have never had Pizza like this in Chicago. 

Was it better than Pizza Hut or Barro's? Yes. Was it better than Oregano's or Rosati's. No!

We first ordered an Anti-Pasto Salad with mixed greens. It was a bed of lettuce and spinach with some Italian Meats and Cheeses. Lots of sliced Green and Black Olives and a couple of Peperoncini. Not impressed. Oregano's wins this one hands down.

The pizza. We ordered a Peperoni, Mushroom and Black Olive Pizza.
The most notable thing was that the sauce was very sweet, too sweet. Now I've had a sweet sauce ad liked it but this one was overpowering. I prefer a more tart sauce with a more oregano and basil flavor with some spice.

The cheese was good but the mushrooms were canned. The crust was more like a biscuit dough and it was more buttery and flaky than crispy.

If you want a Thin Crust Chicago Pizza with a slightly sweet sauce I would recommend Johnie\"s Chicago Pizza on Cave Creek.  Spinato's has Coke and Johnie's has Pepsi and I would go to Johnie's anytime even though he has Pepsi. 

To say the least I was very disappointed with Spinato's when there is an Oregano's less than 3 miles away.

One other thing. I ordered my son a Kids Pizza, Drink Dessert and instead of giving me the Kids price they charged me the separate price because they did not see me order it off the kids menu. I asked WTF and they did adjust it when I complained.

To give you an idea of the Chicago Pizza I like for those of you from Chicago to rate my taste here they are. Lou Malnati's or Original Due's Barnaby's. Village Inn, Home Run Inn. Edwardo's, Bacino's. Gigo's Evanston. 

In Chicago Rosati's would barely make my list but in Phoenix it's near the top, only second to Oregano's. I do not like anybody's Pan Pizza in Phoenix.

I did forget one thing that was actually very good. The Gelato that came with my son's meal. It was really good. Really good. Not good enough to go back and eat the pizza for though. I have been told the Italian Beef is really good. The same person who told me the pizza was good is the person who said that so I'm not really sure if I want to chance it. What do you think?"}
{"text":"Went there tonight. Agree look for the ban excellent service and amazing pizza. We will be back. We are from Chicago and picky about great pizza. Small place but worth the wait"}
{"text":"Our family comes from Chicago area, & we frequented Aurelio's- & were thrilled to find Spinato's here!! They now have 4 locations- their sauce is delicious- pizzas are thin crust, & you can order extra-crispy, if desired. This place is family owned, great people, & clean- a major thing I look for in a dining establishment! They also deliver (not sure if at all locations, tho).
I have even called in to radio stations to tell others; but like the other poster(s), don't want to have to wait for 'my' table!
Check them out if you like pizza!!!!! Best we've found in Phx!"}
{"text":"Love the hidden location. service was fast and fantastic. I ordered a pizza thinking I would get thick crust but the standard was thin crust and no one asked. The pizza tasted great. I also tried the spaghetti calzone which everyone raves about but at least for me it was nothing to write home about"}
{"text":"I've been to Spinatos a few times now.  I've had the famous spinach, the Chicago, and the Super Six.  All of their pizzas look delicious and are generous with the toppings.  The first couple of slices were overwhelmingly sweet.  Almost too sweet for my liking.  

That being said it kinda grew on me and before I knew it I ate almost half of the first pizza.  I dont think Id ever order the spinach again but the Chicago and Super Six I would recommend.  

The prices are a bit high.  ~20 bucks for a medium Super Six before tip is a bit much for a pizza in my book.  Spinatos does not crack my top 5 in the Valley but I would definitely recommend you trying it if you are a general fan of pizza."}
{"text":"Amazing place love the restaurant's setting. Finally the pizza i was looking for. This is definitely my favorite pizza place in Arizona it will be my go to place. So glad i found it!! I am excited to try their salads as well because they look yummyy"}
{"text":"Simply THE BEST PIZZA in the Valley of the Sun.  The sauce is perfection and every kind of pizza I've had has been superb.  Reasonable prices, fast service, take out rocks."}
{"text":"Oh, Spinato's!  Somehow your unbelievably delicious Mama's Original pizza made a spinach-lover out of my 4-year-old.  Amazing!  We also love the Spicy Italian (who doesn't like spicy Italians?!).  The antipasto salad with half spinach is always crisp, fresh and delicious.  Extra points for the gluten-free crust option!  Spinato's is the perfect place to bring a family or grab a pizza to go."}
{"text":"They have the most delicious pizza ever! It's probably one of my favorite places to go. It's in a tiny complex across from Tempe marketplace, but it's definitely worth a try. The staff is always kind and willing to help you in making decisions."}
{"text":"Very hard to find gluten free pizza that is worth eating, but spinatos was pretty good. I really liked the GF cheesy garlic bread cause it was thick and chewy like real bread. I thought the crust on one of our GF  pizzas was over cooked because it kinda crumbled as you took a bite. 

The Nicole's new favorite was the other one we got and it was tasty. They were fast and friendly over the phone. But next time we won't get delivery, took a while and ends up costing more."}
{"text":"Food 4 stars - service 5+ stars

Found this on Yelp on got there right when it opened.  Within 15 minutes the place was packed, we thought....\"this must be good\".  We tried the beef steak calzone with au jus - very tasty.  I tried the Natalie's new pizza (small size) and my BF had a meat pizza.  I wasn't a huge fan of the thin crust - it is more cornmeal than dough but the toppings and flavor profile was delicious.  we also had salad since and tried 2 of their 6 homemade dressings.

The waitress was fantastic.  She even brought a sample of their vodka marinara and marinara sauces to try and they were incredible.  They were dark red, very condensed, excellent flavor.  They sell the dressings & sauces at the store.  

A good find and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My job frequently gets catering from this place and there are never any leftover slices within 10min of the entire floor being aware. It was so good i decided to go there for lunch one afternoon. The location is very strange as it's down an industrial drive so you can almost miss it. 

I will just add to the overall sentiment shared by everyone that this is the best tasting pizza there is....in Arizona. I haven't had the pies from up North but I can't imagine them tasting much better than this. A solid 8."}
{"text":"They have the best reservation system. You get s text with your reservation time with the option to cancel and then a text and a call when your table is ready, ofcourse the pizza is awesome and totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a 5 just for their spaghetti and meatball calzone. It sounds awful, but it is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Must try!!"}
{"text":"Had Spinato's for take out last night. Good service... Ordered the sausage thin crust. The bottom of the crust wasn't very good, could have been cooked longer. Sauce was a little sweeter and didn't have any special flavor. Pizza seemed like it had too much cheese. Not the pizza for me."}
{"text":"The pizza is really good. The service is awesome. They have a chocolate cake that is over the top. The restaurant is small and doesn't serve liquor. It's a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Nestled amongst surrounding businesses I've driven past Spinato's Pizza at least a dozen times. I joined a group of friends for dinner or I might have never discovered this quaint little restaurant. I decided as this was my first visit to go with the pizza choices of those who had been before. We shared a thick crust half  Mamma Spinato's signature fresh spinach , and  half  Get Meaty special. Their sauce is significantly sweeter than most places but the flavor is good as was the pizza. The crust however thick was a bit dry and crunchy at the ends, perhaps overdone just a bit. They do however offer thin crust as well as Gluten free which is a bonus for some. It did take a little long for our food to come out but our server was very attentive and managed our group of twelve without any issues. I ordered the Holy Cannoli, crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside it was a perfectly delicious way to end the meal."}
{"text":"My hubby and I headed to Phoenix for the night with the kiddos. We were all starving and wanted a restaurant that would be family friendly. Spinato's has been bookmarked for a while so we headed over. This location is in an industrial area which we didn't quite expect but it was still easy to find. This location does not serve the full menu nor does it serve alcohol. We were expecting to have a beer or two with our pizza but it wasn't a huge deal. We made our way in with no wait. We ordered a large Get meat pizza on a Sicilian crust. The waitress told us the thin crust was most popular but my hubby insisted the thicker crust, and we shared an order of meatballs and garlic bread. The food came out quickly and was awesome. The meatballs were so tender and the sauce was to die for. The pizza was good too. A little thick for my taste but still very good. The next time we eat here we will try the thinner crust since that is what is they are know for. Overall we had a wonderful meal and would recommend them to all."}
{"text":"Pizza sauce is sweet and amazing. Get the deep dish. It's not really deep dish but it's still very good. Get over the location and seating area for the food. Price point is good for the quality and quantity you get."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in town.  They have 4 locations.  1 in Tempe which used to be the best because it allowed you to bring in your own alcohol but that is no longer.  2 in phoenix which are great and 1 in NE scottsdale.  The pizza is to die for with a thin crust and a semi sweet sauce.  They do offer a thick (sicilian crust) but the thin is best.  The sauce is sweet but not to sweet and the toppings are fresh and plentiful.  I personally love the hawaiian with italian sausage or the italian sausage with mushroom and onion.  The service is good and  you feel right at home.  Dont forget to get the cheese bread with marinara....It's to die for.  All 4 restaurants are family owned and you can tell by the taste, quality and experience you have each and every time.  The Best."}
{"text":"Four and a half stars! 

While in AZ for work, I got a chance to try this place out. The location is small and in an office park type area, but from my experiences these places usually have the best food. I was NOT disappointed. 

I was even a fan of the crushed style ice they use in their gigantic drinking cups - less need for refills. I ordered a dinner salad to start and it was definitely fresh! There's not much you can do to mess up a salad, and this place has large portion sizes. But this place is all about the pizza. I had the thin crust with mixed peppers and green olives - yes green olives - a true rarity to find in pizza joints where I'm from. Usually you're stuck with just the black olives. 

The crust was perfect - not tortilla thin - so it actually held the toppings. They don't skimp on the toppings or cheese and the sauce is absolutely perfect.  Apparently they make their own sauce (lightly sweet) and at this particular spot they make it all and send out to the other locations. 

Service was great. The greeter offered gluten-free menus before we were even seated, the server was patient and helpful and the manager stopped by every table towards the end of everyone's meals. 

I'd give this 5 stars, but the only thing I learned that stole that 'half' star was that they use frozen peppers. I prefer just green peppers but the stash they use has red/green mixed as they come in a bag. 

Truthfully it was an insignificant point due to the amazing flavor of their pizza and great service. 

Highly recommended if you're ever in this area!  Since its not too far from the airport, if I'm ever in town for work again, I'm definitely getting back out to Spinatos!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza, by far, in my neighborhood. The pizza was awesome!!!!!! I will be going back Tomorrow for round 2."}
{"text":"This place is the greatest! You may need to wait 20 min due to its size but it's more than worth it. Their spaghetti and meatballs calzone is top three best things I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"I went here for a first date. The place is a tad small and you'd miss it you driving down the street trying to look for it. Look for the van, you'll see it, ha. 

It's small and dimmed light inside. It's really cute. We ordered a pizza and our server was really nice and kept our waters full. Which in my eyes is legit. I feel like most places forget about you when all you want is some hydration with your meal. 

Anyways, we got our pizza and BAM! It was delicious. I've never gone to here before, but I'll definitely come back and try their other pizzas."}
{"text":"Have you ever watched the turkey dinner scene in National Lampoons Christmas Vacation? I had to melt down every bite of that pizza with water before swallowing it. If I wasn't so hungry I would have thrown it away and gone out to eat... 

It tasted like cardboard... I should have known it was bad pizza the second the guy I ordered it from said we're all out of 11\" pizzas. Right then and there was my clue that they don't even make their own dough. A pre-Made frozen pie shell is what they are using. I could have gone to the store and purchased a stuffed crust Freschetta and been a lot happier. Not to mention that the 7\" pizza with an order of 6 bread sticks cost me $18 bucks...

I've lived all over AZ for the last 12 years and have ordered pizza from all over the place... You want a good pie? Here are 6 quality places:

1. Veneiza's - NY style with Blue cheese and they have Buffalo wings. Want a good deal? Go in and get the 2 slices and a beverage for like 5 bucks... Want the biggest pizza you have ever seen? Order the Party Pie... Awesome!
2. Reno D's - Great Pies with a unique flavor. Wings have an awesome sauce so order a side and you'll get a 12oz container full.
3. Nellos - Offers great pie and a good price.
4. Pizzeria Bianco - Sit down joint. Make a reservation! Brick Oven, gourmet style...
5. Oreganos - Good pies including Chicago style. No delivery option though!
6. Gus's on Campus is a good \"I'm drunk and hungry\" place. Go Sober up!

Just stay the hell away from Spinato's because no one should have to eat crappy pie... Especially during football season!

AJ - Tempe, Az."}
{"text":"This place, though easily accessible because of its proximity to the Tempe Marketplace, can be easy to miss because it's tucked within a commercial complex in an industrial area. Inside, the setting is simple and very informal, and lighting is at a comfortably low, relaxing level. Service is efficient and friendly, and of course the pizza is quite good. A big plus for me is that people with gluten restrictions can opt for a gluten-free crust, which means I can come here with a group and enjoy pizza like everyone else. I guess the only grouse I have about the place is that parking can be tricky during peak hours."}
{"text":"Ben here a few times for lunch. Its in a tiny strip mall, and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here, and you have to remember to control yourself :)"}
{"text":"Spinato's is a sweet, garlicy, gem hidden in an industrial park near Tempe Marketplace and apparently it's been surviving back there for a couple of decades. I am convinced that this is the best pizza in Tempe, perhaps the whole valley. Their pizzas are thin-crust and sliced in a grid, which means you end up eating about 10 little slices! Their homemade sauce is amazing and sweet and their toppings are fresh and come in an endless variety. Try the Grandma's if you like garlic and their spinach is always pretty tasty when paired with red peppers. The ambiance (if you can call it that) is pretty hilarious...very Long Island...think plastic flowers. If the main rooms fill up, they'll seat you in what definitely used to be a warehouse, still decked out with charming cinderblocks and all. It's also BYOB (my favorite!). They do have weird hours though. I think they close at 8 or 9pm, so give them a call first and get good directions."}
{"text":"This pizza is so good it should be illegal.  

I am a huge pizza snob and this pizza is almost perfect.  Their homemade Italian sausage is amazing - this is what sausage is supposed to taste like!  The sauce is sweet in a really really good way.  Cheese is delicious and the butter crust has a nice flavor.  The only critique I have is the crust was a little softer than I like on a thin crust. 

Their pizza is pretty expensive for carry out and even though its worth every penny, it's a bit disappointing because 2 large thin crust  pizzas for carry out would be about $45.  That's way too much!  If they were a little less expensive, I'd be there once a week!"}
{"text":"First visit...Very busy; but worth the wait to get a table...First of all; like the selection of \"discontinued\" wine and beer; didn't try - but great concept.  Had the pizza; my roommate had the calzone.  Both items were hot out of the oven; tasted excellent.  Service was great.  Will definately be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing family atmosphere with an authentic Italian flavor to the Decour and the menu.
The staff is so friendly and it's worth the wait"}
{"text":"The menu at Spinato's is great and has something for everyone!  The calzones are outstanding and highly recommended.  The service was quick and friendly.  Our server even noticed that I'm pregnant and gave me a free Spinato's baby shirt - so cute.  

As a side note - this location does not offer any alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"Excellent food, very impressed. Took a while to come out to us but it was definitely worth the wait. Best chicken alfredo I've had, as well as amazing pizza."}
{"text":"***Moving to 5509 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85014***

This location is closing at the end of November 2013 to a new location on 7th St and Missouri. They will offer some great new menu items, as well as introducing a caf√©/marketplace/bakery!

---------------------------------------------------------------------

From article at http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2013/11/spinatos_pizzeria_pizza_central_phoenix_restaurant_new.php

The family-owned local chain that's been making old-school Chicago-style pies in the Valley just shy of 40 years has announced their newest location, a 10,000-square-foot space at 5509 North 7th Street in Central Phoenix (7th Street and Missouri), will officially open Monday, November 25."}
{"text":"The place is located in what appears to me a parts warehouse. After Parking I really debated even going in, its not what you would expect a pizza place to look like. I\"m so accustomed to seeing corporate pizza places. 
Inside the place is a bit small yet cozy and private. We were lucky enough to get a window table. No waiting 3pm on a Wednesday. 

The waiter is A+ stars from start to finish. 
Recommended good plates, maintained my water full, checked up on us from time to time, brought the tab in a timely manner without me trying to hunt him down. 

Appetizer:
Baked Artichoke Crostini, the bread is crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. topped with delicious cheese and hearty artichoke cooked to perfection.

Main meal:
L'Italiana is really  freak'n good. A nice thin crust with a very distinct sauce. 

NO alcohol license so I went with water.

Everything looks mouthwatering, I can't wait to attack this place again.

I would recommend coming during their happy hour 2pm-6pm. The meals are at a discounted price."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of Spinato's pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The combination of the sweet sauce and cheese blend makes for the perfect pizza."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place to try to take a large group.  The food is mediocre at best.  But they run the place poorly.

We called ahead to see if they could seat a party of 8.  They told us that they could not take our name over the phone, instead we had to show up to put our names in.  My wife went ahead and reserved the table.  She was told it would be 45 minutes.  She came home and we began getting the kids ready.  We showed up 15 minutes before we were told, but they had already given the table away.  We were told that it would be another half hour before we could be seated.  

Unfortunately, their waiting area is very packed and does not hold 8 comfortably.   We left, I will never go back.  It should not be a hassle to take your family out to eat.  The main reason for eating out is to avoid hassle.  Spinato's does a good job of making life difficult."}
{"text":"The pizza is phenomenal and the sauce is original. No complaints. They just need to get beer!!!  Not much else to say"}
{"text":"Solid pizza but not the BEST pizza I've ever had (which I am still searching for FYI). We ordered two small pizzas, the Salsiccia di pollo and the Spicy Italian, to split between 3 people and it was a great amount of food for us. Our server warned us that the salsiccia is a different, \"healthier\" pizza and it definitely showed, there wasn't very much taste given that it's topped with olive oil instead of sauce. To balance out the health we also ordered the spicy Italian which is basically just meat with meat and red sauce and I loved it. The crust also really stood out to me as I thought it had a very interesting texture, more crumbly? than typical pizza crust is. I was diggin it. I'll definitely be back to try out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Arizona hands down. We love coming here. Get the Specialty Mamma Spinach Pizza and add sausage and jalape√±o. Mmmmmm. A little more pricey but you can taste the quality. Both the thin crust and Sicilian crust are great. Less than a mile from home too! Just wish they delivered to our residence. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First off, I consider myself a pizza snob. I love pizza and I'm not one for trying new places. After much struggling, my fianc√© convinced me to try Spinatos. I have to say I went in with my nose in the air. Usually, if I'm getting pizza I'll go to a make-it-yourself place, such as My Pie or Fired Pie. If I'm ordering pizza, I will order from Venezias which is a personal favorite of mine . Well, move over Venezias! This place has it all! I love the atmosphere here. It's tucked into an industrial strip mall in the furthest corner of a no-man's-land area. It's seriously a hole in the wall, but once you walk inside it's booming and bustling to life. The smells and the restaurant itself are amazing and the pizza is out of this world! I don't have much to say about the pizza, as it's pizza, but it's fantastic pizza and similarly priced as your major pizza chains. I highly suggest this place as it's cheap and better than most any other pizza you would find in the valley."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! And very courteous staff! We order from them 2-3 times a month. Double up on the sauce for extra taste! We love Spinato's."}
{"text":"i am just not a fan of this kind of pizza. i hate the sweet sauce, i hate that the ingredients are under the cheese so they don't get crunchy and crispy, the pepperoni is floppy. just not for me. the crust was kinda gooey like. 

my delivery was 30 minutes late but its ok bc i wasn't in a hurry. they were really nice i just can't stand this kind of pizza. 


if you like the sweet sauce and toppings under the cheese then go for it bc you'll probably love it!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Yum! Hard to decide which one to get. Greek salad was also delicious. Great job, Spinatos."}
{"text":"If you are a former Chicagoan looking for a taste of home, this is the place for you....best pizza in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had. Pizza is my go to for dinner, this will be the only place I go from now on! Service was great, Bailey kept up on refills and didn't forget about us. She was very nice also! The pizza was ooey and gooey and the cheesey garlic bread was extremely delicious. Loaded with flavor and super cheesy!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza with a nice crust, fresh toppings, and filling. The garlic cheese bread was awesome! Service was really great."}
{"text":"Best pizza I found so far in tempe. A little pricey but you get your money worth. I like the mamma's spinach CALZONE. The mamma's spinach pizza wasnt as good. Be prepared for some garlic though! You may want to ask w/o garlic if you dont like it ;-) ... overall really really good!"}
{"text":"Being originally from Chicago, I can tell you that Spinatos is the best pizza that I have found in the Phoenix area!  I like thin crust and their thin crust is light and cooked to perfection.  When you ask for Italian sausage you actually get.....get this....Italian sausage!  Not that crap like in other places!  The sauce is so good and it's sweet!  .... Just like my Chicago pizza!!  The service is always good and the pizza is always the same:  AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the world.  Seriously.  I feel like that's all I have to say.


But I will say more.
As far as the pizza goes, I've only tried the Mama Spinato's pizza because it's so good that I can't get myself to try anything else... probably because it's just perfect.  The flavor... the texture... oh God.  Salads, breadsticks, cheesesticks, and calzones are also amazing.  And TRY the pumpkin gelato that's seasonal--it's TO DIE for.
Also, great, quick, friendly service.  They box everything up for you, and offer you giant to-go cups for your drinks even.

My mouth is watering right now."}
{"text":"Love Spinatos. Great pizza. Love the vodka sauce for the cheese bread. Friendly staff, great place to eat."}
{"text":"Pretty nice spot. Service wasn't bad and the pizza was pretty good. It doesn't appear to have a hectic atmosphere, at least when I visited. I approve."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!! Pizza is sooo good. A friend of mine took me here for the first time and I have been hooked ever since. Great food and really friendly staff. The only thing I don't like is that the whole restaurant shares one bathroom.(me being a germ a phob) lol. But the pizza is soo awesome. I normally like to get the pizza with extra suace on top. Sooo delicious."}
{"text":"What to eat, what to eat.... 

So as a traveling sales man, I see a lot of my windshield, and even more places to eat.   Of course there are your typical chain type places that I go to when I can't make a decision - but I'm sure glad i didn't go that route here.   I was dying for a pizza.  you know, that water in your mouth desire to fill a need you can't satisfy any other way... 

Yea.   So I log onto Yelp, and BAM - 1.1 miles away, a pizza joint with rave reviews!!

People! You have not tasted what good pizza can actually do to you...   

The ingredients are fresh, the dough is just right, the size is perfect and the flavor is an orgy waiting for you to join in."}
{"text":"Not typically the kind of pizza pIace I usually visit. It's a very whole in the wall type of place. I droveright past it when trying to locate it. With the amount of yelp reviews that it had and how late it was, I HAD to check it out. I was not disappointed!

I ordered the spinach pizza (take-out). Delicious, not too oily and not too salty. I only wish that the bottom was less soggy, but I guess some people like their pizza like that?

4/5 Would come back for late night pizza"}
{"text":"Some primo eats... period. Me likes the beer specials I've happened upon there. If you want to know what a moron is, scroll down and read a low rating for this place... because there is no way to not dig on this killer grub."}
{"text":"Got the thin crust this time.  I think my friend summed it up - it seems like good pizza, just not for us.  Everything's too sweet and the crust is so doughy.  Even the thin crust wasn't very crisp.  I think I'll leave the space for people that would appreciate it because the lot is so limited anyway."}
{"text":"This is probably some of the BEST pizza Ive had in Arizona.  It reminds me of one of my favorite places in Chicago.  There are a few locations around the valley but this one is the one closest to me. It's a very small place and only seats about 30 people but there usually is never a wait and the service is really quick."}
{"text":"This place has really good thick and thin crust pizza.  I've never been a fan of thin crust because of it being so crispy and it just wasn't good to me.  However, the thin crust pizza here is quite good.  I would order it again.  It's really small inside the restaurant, so I would recommend ordering it to go."}
{"text":"When I use to travel for business all over the states, my buddy in Arizona mentioned that I need to visit Spinatos. To be honest when I first arrived I didnt think I was at the right place we were in some industrial park, total hole in the wall type feel. But man I crave their pizza all the time now, in fact I pray that they bring one of these to Utah and I promise they would be the best pizza joint in town. Great food, great price."}
{"text":"Where did this place come from?  It's in a strange location but it's a small, neat space.  On a Friday evening at 6:30pm our group of 6 was able to be seated no problem.  Having never been here before, our group was ready for a beer.  Say what?!?!  No alcohol?!?!  What's pizza without a cold beer?  Anyway.  

I started with the garlic bread sticks and the house salad with spinach.  Both were above average and delicious!  I was practically licking the bottom of the salad bowl and my husband definitely stole a 3rd bread stick.  

On to the pizza.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to read the trusted Yelp reviews prior and was therefore surprised by the somewhat sweet sauce.  It was okay....but I'm not a fan.  The \"Lil\" Sicilian cheese pizza I got was the perfect size (I did have a salad and bread sticks prior thought!).  

Service was good - no complaints.  I think they deliver - so maybe next time we're at Sleepy Dog brewery we can call them up and enjoy some pizza with our beer!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was great. It's a small place so, on a Saturday night there is a bit of a wait. Other than that, great service and delicious pizza. We ordered \"Da Greek\" and added chicken sausage. It was so good and with all the veggies, eating it didn't make me feel to guilty hehe."}
{"text":"Let me share my Spinato's experience with you.

I have had their pizza a few times, but the last time was the last. And I mean it. The last experience was with their food I ordered \"Traditional Vegetarian\", with added pepperoncini. Got home, no pepperoncini. Oh well, no big deal. Started eating it and discovered a strange flavor. Kinda like dog treats. Went to kitchen to inspect pizza. Well, low and behold, under the inch or so of cheez (I don't think its real cheese) was PEPPERONI on the \"Traditional Vegetarian\". UHM OK?! Verified the receipt and it was entered correctly! This household doesn't eat animals. I'm sorry, between the overly sweetened sauce, too much cheese, undercooked crust and the mixup I will never again waste my money here.

Please, if you want pizza, do not come here."}
{"text":"Great food!! Plan for a long wait, go at an off time or do take-out! The food is worth it and pizza and calzones are awesome! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"We ate here twice in one week on our spring break vacation. First, we at there and had the special spinach pizza. We don't eat meat, so the idea that there was a special pizza that didn't have meat was fascinating and boy did it deliver on taste. Super garlicky, if you're into that kind of thing. Kiddo's plain cheese pizza was even good. Then we ordered a to-go super veggie pizza for round two. That was delicious as well. Good service, not fancy. Just go and eat and drink and have a nice time."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this the best pizza ever, but it is very very good.  I've been hearing a bunch of buzz about this place so naturally I needed to give it a shot.  I'm not a big fan of the \"sweet\" sauce people on Yelp talk about but I'm down for anything.

My wife and I went for an early dinner Friday.  The location of this place is a bit different and we had trouble finding it.  It is in an office building type thing and it is pretty genius how they did it.  We had a little trouble finding it but the cars parked up and down the side of the road was a good indication that we were close.  It is a no-frills place but is actually pretty homey and not cold and stark as you think it would be.  We got there about 6ish and it was already pretty busy.  There were only 1 or 2 free tables.  We were seated promptly and the service was top-notch the entire time.

The pizza:

My wife and I split a small pizza.  It was half the Signature and half of the homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni (both thin crust).  It was more than enough for 2 people.  The crust is almost perfect, not overly sauced, and plentiful cheese and toppings.  It really is some great pizza.  But yeah, I'm not really a fan of the sweet sauce.

* Signature Fresh Spinach = pretty good.  I'm not really a fan of those toppings but I've heard rave review about the pie so I need to get it.  I'm not sure I would order it again but I'm glad I tried it.

* Homemade Italian Sausage and Pepperoni.  This was excellent pizza!  My wife thought it was a bit oily but its friggin pizza and that's how it should be.  The sausage and peperoni were both delish.

* Margherita = we ordered a lil one of these.  I thought it was very good but my wife loved loved loved it.  The crust was light and airy and the toppings/cheese weren't overkill.

* Mama's Antipasto Salad = eh..ok.  I wouldn't order it again.  Nothing special.  They need a Caesar on the menu.

Anyway, the place is great.  When I feel the need to get carbed out I will return.  I just have to remember to get there early because by 7ish there is a line out the door.  I also wouldn't mind doing delivery and/or their take-and-bake pizza."}
{"text":"I recently revisited Spinato's with my parents and brother's family. Though I thought their pizza was really good I was taken back by how delicious their cheesy garlic bread was. I could have just eaten that with a little salad and have been very happy. The portions were generous. I saw one of the calzones and WOW...it was huge! I really want to go back for one (seriously, you have to see it. It looks like someone folded a pizza over a ham). Overall, very warm and inviting people. Good food."}
{"text":"I just visited their new location at 7th Street and Missouri.  The baked spaghetti calzone (with meatballs and ricotta cheese) put me into a wonderful afternoon food coma.  The personal size is more than enough for a filling lunch, but you need to get the regular size if you want to take some leftovers home.  They have such amazing food and they have a beautiful new building now too!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!  We are from out of town, and wanted to try a local place. We are so glad we did! The pizza was delicious,  probably the second best I've ever had behind Mariela's pizza in NYC. The service was super  friendly, and they even gave our baby a t-shirt. We ordered cheesy garlic bread, which the whole family loved (but we especially loved the marinara dipping sauce). Then, we ordered the chicken pesto pizza,  and the famous 6-- both were delicious."}
{"text":"I got lost finding this place for the first time.

It was a Saturday around 2pm and it was packed.  We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table.  Then after we got a table and ordered and got our huge glasses of iced tea we had to wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for our food.  We were so hungry we asked for crackers or bread or something to eat while we waited.  The waitress said she would bring hot bread and never did.  About an hour after arrival we finally got our food.  

I REALLY wanted to hate this place.

The spaghetti calzone was SO SO YUMMY.  It was delicious and a week later I still can't stop thinking about it.

My kids each got a pizza and it was as first time I have seen them eat everything they ordered.

My husband got a gluten free pizza and thought it was just okay.  For how expensive it was he said he would stick to Barros.

But the spaghetti calzone.  Mmmmmm... I look forward to trying the pizza myself next time as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in town so far.  Yeah, it's kinda pricy, and sure, the location is not super luxe, but dammit if the pizza isn't brilliant!

The toppings are fresh, the crust is savory, and the best part - absolutely the best part - is the sauce.  It's fresh, sweet, and tangy - it's unlike any other sauce I've ever had.

This isn't cheep (it's not going to break the bank either), so if you're drunk and need a cheesy/greasy fix, hit up Little Caesars or Hungry Howies, but if you want some truly delicious and satisfying pizza, try Spinato's - you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Chicago but haven't lived there in many years.....this place took me home! I had the Italian beef sandwich with giardenera and a portion of a small pizza - the food was great! The only thing...which is not their fault...is that I should have requested a \"dipped\" sandwich. I highly recommend this place, their Chicago style menu items are very tasty."}
{"text":"my family and I have been going to spinato's for several years, so we where very exited when we found out their new location was only 4 blocks away from our home \"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT'' the menu is lacking some of their best dishes we ordered a pizza I don't know if they got new cooks or he was having a bad day I ordered the spaghetti with the side of meatballs and you only get 2 choices of sauce COME ON \"spaghetti factory you can order the spaghetti with meatballs\" I guess if you have to buy separate they charge you more money witch is ridiculous for frozen meatballs I took a bite and it was cold and wet inside  I asked for the manager and he never came, I wonder how many of this reviews are from their friends and family this new restaurant does not measure up to the old one my family and I will not be going back"}
{"text":"Spinato's is a bit off the beaten path, but don't let that deter you. Not only is the food amazing, but the service is unbelievable. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and valued as customers, something that you don't see often these days.

Spinato's is easily best pizza place in Tempe, I'd recommend it to anyone in or going through the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza, horrible service! I've always come here and been excited to bring someone new to my favorite pizza place in the valley (their unique pizzas really are fabulous), but after several bad experiences with the hosts and waiters, I won't be coming back. Making any adjustments to the pizzas (even due to health and allergies) has been something they've actually fought us on (pricing on regular and happy hour and accommodating ingredients) and it's been nothing but disappointments."}
{"text":"Family owned and super fresh ingredients. Their pizza sauce is the best I've ever had. Their salads are great too. Even the delivery guys are the best. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in tempe. I am never disappointed. The staff is friendly. The prices are reasonable. Their pizza sauce has a sweetness to it that tastes so good!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Yelped for good Pizza. Hit the absolute Jackpot! The sauce is so good! And the Antipasto Salad is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place out because I've heard great things. Was disappointed. I thought there was more to the menu than pizza but there wasn't. I guess it's just this location. Pizza was good but nothing out of this world and definitely not worth the price we paid. Pretty pricey for pizza, which I don't mind paying if the pizza is amazing. This was not."}
{"text":"Great Calzones, good pizza selections.  Their ambience is nothing to shout about if you are eating there.  But I am more concerned about taste so its fine, we sat in their back area when they had renovations once.  Its like U are seated on the other side of the false wall partitions and you see the cement floor, overhead wirings, wirings and pipes in the wall.  But hey, the food is all that matters, and they have decent servers who try hard to take good care of you.

Prices are also very decent due to their location being in the middle of an entire office and warehouse building zone.  My old office was just next door and my mechanic is in the same complex.  They get busy at lunch time with a lot of pick up orders and walk in for lunch from the nearby businesses.

If you are in the Tempe Marketplace area and need a good pizza and you have been to Slices over there and wanna try something different, this is the place."}
{"text":"Sons friend ordered a pizza the other night for delivery came in under a half hour Color me shocked guess I was use to the 1 hour wait at dominos. Tried the pizza and OMG reminded me of Home in New England Thin tasty and plenty of cheese. 
A few days later ordered cand. bacon and pineapple at noon it got here not even 20 minutes later. Hot and super thin where you had to fold it to eat it and I was in heaven. Not sure what style pizza they call it but it reminds me of the Boston area pizzas Sweet sauce and loads of cheese made me home sick. They are now going to be my main pizza place of coarse it helps that they are located just half a mile from me and seem to deliver very fast. 
Give them a shot if you like thin pizzas ala NYC and New England"}
{"text":"Omg they changed!  They updated their meatball sub and it is awful?  We use to go 1-2 times a week and we haven't been back!  They don't seem to care either.  Sorry spinatos you made a huge mistake.  May be only the bread to you but THAT BREAD made the sandwich.  BAAAADDDDD DECISION.  It use to hold the meatballs in and it was not messy.  Now the bread is wimpy and don't even hold the meatballs.  Raise the price do not lower the standard of quality."}
{"text":"Five stars for mama's signature spinach pizza... i dont even need to try anything else on the menu it's that good.  I eat it without cheese and it's so delicious!  Great sauce and the spinach gets perfectly crispy!"}
{"text":"Their pizza ad calzones are delicious! Fresh tomato sauce and ricotta cheese! Quick service."}
{"text":"I have followed Ken Spinato around the valley... from McDowell,in Scottsdale,to Smith in Tempe.& everywhere in between 30+ Years . I'm from Chicago ... and this is One GREAT PIZZA ... MANGA!!   Ciao Tony Morello:"}
{"text":"I discovered  Spinato's over two years ago when I lived Phoenix and I've always loved the food. About six months ago I moved to Mesa and began ordering from the Tempe location. The quality of food is just as good as any location but they don't seem to care, what so ever, about customer satisfaction.
I've asked them a few times now to customize my order and they always refuse. I could understand if I asked for something complex but it's only ever been small things. Like the last time I went, I asked for one of their sandwiches made with garlic bread. Pretending they don't have prepared garlic bread standing by, it's not hard to melt butter on bread and then sprinkle garlic on it!
I e-mailed the manager to complain but he never responded, making it clear to me that customer satisfaction is just not important to them. Personally I'd rather spend my money at a business that appreciates my business."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Tempe.  Place is small and hidden but a true find.  The staff is friendly too with great service.  The food taste much better when it is dine in...for some reason takeout doesn't taste the same..."}
{"text":"Schedule your dentist appointment now, their sauce is sweet!!!  I have had sweet sauces before, but this one takes the cake!!! Not that it was bad tasting, but I personally think that they could reduce the sweetness and bring out some of the other flavors of the sauce.  I had the spaghetti and meatball calzone and the ingredients were delicious, but the sweet sauce seemed to over power some of the flavor.  My dining partner had the spinach special pizza and the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  We also had the bruschetta and the bread was perfectly toasted and the tomatoes, basil, and peppers were great!!!

I am not the biggest fan of the sweet sauce, but If you can get by it, I recommend that you check it out."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing! Service was great. We got the Mama's Other Signature, so tasty!"}
{"text":"I've only had the gluten free pizza here, but I ordered the Greek one and oh my Lordy was it good! That's the best GF pizza crust I've ever had. Only thing that bummed me out was I picked the one location that doesn't carry beer. The other locations have GF beer. But the pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT and a must if you haven't eaten here before. Be prepared to wait, by it's worth it!!! Best cheese bread I've ever had!"}
{"text":"A wonderful place to eat pizza and cannolli, all food was delicious our waitress Maria was amazing she made us feel like family."}
{"text":"Had great pizza, salad and calzone. The pizza was hot and fresh. We had the Chicago calzone and it was very tasty with a great crust. Tried two salads and it did not disappoint. We will definitely stop in again."}
{"text":"Love love LOVEE Spinato's. Their red sauce is to die for, perfectly sweet and tangy! 

Calzones are fabulous as well, especially the spinach, garlic & tomato one. Wards off hoardes of vampires, I'm sure. Warning - these don't reheat well. Plan on eating it all fresh.

Normally multi-meat pizzas make me want to ralph from greasiness, but their \"Get Meaty\" is really good, the sausage (I think?!) has a nice smokey flavor that goes well with the sweet sauce.

I go to the location in Tempe, but I believe they make their food in one place, so you shouldn't get much of a difference as far as quality goes."}
{"text":"THIS is why I love Yelp! We would have never found and tried Spinato's if I hadn't been searching Yelp for a good pizza place we hadn't tried before.  We weren't sure what to expect when we found it because it's not much to look at outside (and kind of hard to find), but it's honestly become our favorite pizza in the area.  There's not a huge dining area inside so sometimes there's a wait, but it's worth it.  We always get the super six pizza, even though we aren't lovers of peppers... that pizza is amazing!  We also love the meatball appetizer with the vodka cream sauce.  YUM.  I was actually just given a jar of that sauce for Mother's Day (they sell it) - I have a good daughter who knows what mama likes!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it has taken me so long to actually go to this place.... Boy have I been missing out! The pizza was so amazing! You can taste the freshness and the homemade quality! I had to buy the jarred Marinara sauce, because I couldn't get enough! This place is relatively small but that adds to the family owned atmosphere! I will definitely be going again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this location several times, often bringing family as well. Everyone loves everything we've gotten. Any pizza, the calzones, the sandwiches, the salads, and the dessert. If I could eat here everyday, I would!"}
{"text":"This place is legendary. Quite possibly the beat pizza in Arizona. The sauce is just like the pizza back home in Chicago. A definite yes for anyone from the Midwest looking to find good pizza out west. Don't even think about counting calories.....just enjoy your life and eat pizza!"}
{"text":"err mer gersh!!
just go!!!! never ever had a pizza like that! and the salad was phenomenal!
Dont look at the price, just order!"}
{"text":"After months of listening to a coworker talk about how amazing this pizza was I finally gave in and went for lunch. I had a small pep and cheese, which was the perfect lunch size btw. I have to admit that this crust was nothing short of amazing. They were not shy with the toppings either, which made it even more amazing because cheese makes everything awesome. I even found myself thinking about the crust after I left, and the next day as well. I am not sure what they put in that pizza but I am addicted. It would be dangerous if I lived close.... I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good crust, good sauce, just really good. Prices are reasonable, and service was good. My friends both got sandwiches, that they enjoyed. This is my favorite pizza in Phoenix so far, after moving here 6-months ago. I just wish they had a Gilbert location."}
{"text":"I went to Phoenix for baseball spring training last February with my dad. This place had some pretty high ratings on yelp so we decided to stop in. I give it three stars for one reason, we were looking for pizza and beer. Spinato's doesn't serve beer at all. Pizza and beer go hand in hand, like... well like pizza and beer. That was kind of a bummer.

The pizza was really good though. Can't complain about that."}
{"text":"Good pizza! The kids truly enjoyed the meal. Service was fast and efficient. They offer family style salads to share with your pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great. Kind of your typical italian pizza joint. Had the gluten free which is not too bad and a regular pizza. I would say that it's good but I don't ever crave it. I mean I am not making any special trips to go here. If it happens to be in front of me, I will eat it but that said I think there is still much much better pizza out there. In the grand scheme of things, this is upscale domino's!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza i've ever had in my life fo real! Their food is so good! I always get my pizza from here! Tried almost every other pizza restaurant and they all suck! Hands down this is by far the best 10/10!"}
{"text":"Amazing is all I have to say about this place...the end!

Okay, I have to rant on about this place, it's delicious!! I was looking for a location that served the best of the best for pizza and saw Spinato's come up. The service here was exceptional and our waiter was soooo nice! We started off with a salad and I had the raspberry vinaigrette which was awesome. We also had the medium thin crust pizza topped with extra cheese, spinach, and ham...amazing!! To end the meal we had to try the desserts so we shared a holy cannoli and brownie bella which both were mouth watering and a must have.

I will be going back to this place, although that wait was longer than expected and the waiting area was HOT! It was all well worth the wait. :)"}
{"text":"I really had to take time and taste this pizza and some how the thin crust with sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom was very salty either due to the sausage or pepperoni but either way its not the quality of items that I am use to in a pizza, a little history about myself I was raised in a family of catering I really get into the taste of food, the tomato sauce I really did not get that feeling on my taste buds of oh that's good, and by the way when a pizza place starts using a dough press instead of kneading the dough themselves looses 2 stars off the the top, you cannot replace kneading and a rolling pin . I have made pizza's before and i make my own sauce and use quality ingredients once you do it yourself for a while then you can really sharpen your taste buds for  quality pizza. I have to say CIBO has a better pizza, and Grimaldi's due to the fact that the dough, tomato sauce is much better quality.

\"The Gastro\""}
{"text":"REALLY Good! It's so good, it makes good look not so good! I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). 

The spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool."}
{"text":"So first my order got screwed up and I'm still giving 5 stars. I ordered the chicken pesto pizza which was excellent and the strawberry and gorgenzola salad which was also excellent.

Mike the delivery guy was extremely helpful in calling to get my order fixed and the manager was very nice and understanding 

Would defeniatly order from here again"}
{"text":"We ate here because it was close to Tempe martket place and it is advertised and sold
at the A's spring training games. I wasn't disappointed. I had the caesar salad and
a calzone. both were fairly priced and filling. The service was awesome."}
{"text":"The best pizza this side of the Mississippi. The Chicago pizza is delicious. The sauce is sweet and just amazing.  I now buy the sauce from the store and it is just as delicious as it is in the restaurant. They also make a delicious Caesar salad. This is now my go to pizza place and my only complaint is that there isn't one right around the corner from me."}
{"text":"Went at around 5 on a Wednesday and we were able to park directly in front of the door and were seated immediately. The menu had a lot to go over, but we settled on a medium Da Greek pizza. It was ready in about 15 minutes. The menu said it fed 2-3(maybe 3-4?) and between the two of us we finished probably 1/3 of it. Waiter was attentive to everyone seated, but I'm not really sure why they needed probably 3 girls standing by the entrance talking. As you can tell from other photos it is what I call \"hipster pizza\" since nowhere in the northeast would someone try to pass it off as regular pizza, its a way better California Pizza Kitchen type of pizza."}
{"text":"A little tough to find being tucked into an industrial area south of Tempe Marketplace off Smith Ave, but worth the search! The service is spectacular and the ambiance is even better. My sister and I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon and we were seated with no wait time. We started with the garlic cheese bread (heavenly) and ended up splitting a mini margarita pizza and a meatball sub. Between the two of us, we finished it and all! The sauce has kind of a sweetness to it, which is surprisingly delicious and sold in to go jars to enjoy at home. The menu also details take and bake pizzas and happy hour- I'll be back for those! Overall, great pizza at a great price that I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This pizza is seriously addicting and sooo soooooooooo yummy!! I am a huge fan of thin crust pizza and I've eaten it in almost every state I've ever been to (30+) and this restaurant is definitely in my top 5. My first time there, I ordered the L'Italiana with pepperoni. Normally I only eat 2, maybe 3 slices, but this particular time, I ate half the pizza and had my stomach not been so full, I probably would've kept going. I literally could only think about Spinatos pizza until I got it again a couple weeks later, this time ordering Nicole's New Favorite, which like my first order, proved to be incredibly savory and delicious.

Now for the 4/5 star review.... just over a month ago, my boyfriend and I were driving around and decided we wanted pizza (it was a Thursday night, for the record). We were in the Spinatos area and since it's all I could seem to think about when thinking \"pizza,\" we stopped in about 8:15pm (they close at 9pm). We were going to order our pizza 'to go' but instead we stood in the main entrance for just over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by anybody. The people in the kitchen were visibly cleaning, occasionally looking at us, and servers were still going to tables but nobody came to speak with us, although they too looked at us. We ended up getting really frustrated and leaving. It's hard to say why we were ignored, considering the place was only 50% crowded and they still had 45 minutes until closing time. Either way, I was upset with the service and have yet to go back. I almost gave them a lower review but since my previous experiences there had been positive and the pizza is seriously that good, I thought knocking off just 1 star seemed legit. Anyway, if you want some of the BEST pizza you will ever eat, seriously go here! Just be careful going too late or you may not get served at all."}
{"text":"After all the stellar reviews, I admit I was a bit disappointed. We ordered a large pepperoni Sicilian style for carry out. There was plenty of quality cheese on the pizza and the crust had a wonderful flavor, however the sauce was sweet. I am not a fan of sweet sauces so this was a deal breaker for me. Additionally, I also found the pizza a bit salty, however no more so than your typically pizza chains. The pizza was extremely affordable for the size and quality ingredients, so if you don't mind sweet sauce, this place may be for you."}
{"text":"Great pizza! I came here for the first time a few years back when my father in law brought me. I have not had better pizza in the valley. I prefer the thin crust over anything else. The only issue I have had was with the salad, it was a little plain."}
{"text":"I love going here!!! I'm a huge fan of the pesto pizza, it's filling and delicious and cooked right every time. It's a great (affordable on a college budget) pizza alternative to some of the other college pizza spots around here... In my opinion, I've found it to be a long shot better than Venezzias, Hungry Howie's, and Gus's given that it's consistently tasty, not overly greasy, and it's a great restaurant to support."}
{"text":"Despite living in Central PHX for a decade and only two miles from their previous location, until earlier this year I'd never eaten at Spinatos. Twice this year I have ordered the Baked Spaghetti Calzone with ricotta and Vodka Cream sauce as take out. Unique and absolutely delicious! Last night, which was their first night in their new 7th Street and Missouri location, I finally tried their pizza (also as take out). 

I couldn't decide between the Get Meaty or the Here's the Beef, which is not on the Menu link on their website, only on the Order link. Once I got to the order page I was very happy to find that I didn't have to choose between these two pizzas: I could get half of each on one pie. Score! In addition, extra cheese (they offer mozz, ricotta, feta, gorgonzola...the last at least on the Here's the Beef) were at no addt'l charge...though this may only apply to select items (e.g., maybe not for addt'l meats or veggies and perhaps only for their Specialty and Popular Combinations but not if you make your own). Bonus!

The pizza itself was great. Not the best I've ever had (had better albeit different types in Chicago and elsewhere in the Midwest), but maybe the best in PHX. I got the Sicilian crust as I'm not a fan of thin crust and it was excellent. Of the toppings' combos I ordered, I liked the ones on the Here's the Beef (with extra gorgonzola and extra mozz) better, but the problem with this pie was the lack of sauce, which in my opinion is the thing that makes these pizzas so tasty. If I had to do it again, I'd order the Here's the Beef with addt'l pizza sauce. The Get Meaty (with feta and extra mozz) was great, too, no doubt.

I'm happy I finally tried their pizzas and will definitely return to try other combos and hopefully also check out their brand new dining space."}
{"text":"Expected greatness because of the reviews, but Not good at all.  The red sauce is super sweet and sugary.  And I think the Mediterranean pizza is this named because it's like talking a bite out of the Mediterranean Sea.  The meatballs were also mild in flavor and unimpressive.  And it's always so busy.  Not worth the wait at all."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I tried this place during my trip to Phoenix. My group of six and I ordered the spaghetti calzone, a family style salad, and 2 of the super six pizzas. I was really impressed with the spaghetti calzone. I've never had anything quite like it and was pleasantly surprised. The salad was just a salad, and size was pretty small.. not really family style. The pizzas were delicious.

The prices here are very reasonable compared to some of the other pizza places we tried to order from. This place is somewhere I would definitely come back to."}
{"text":"Spinato's originated from Chicago. If I lived in Chicago I would be happy about them moving to AZ. My wife and I shared a thin crust sausage, onion and greenpepper pizza and did not enjoy it. The pizza was bland, maybe it was missing the fennel seeds in the italian suasage that seems to give the sausage that wonderful flavor. I couldn't quite pinpoint what was missing but I'm guessing I won't be making another visit to Spinato's."}
{"text":"I've had pizza all over the country over 40 years and this is the best. Even better than Mario's in Wisconsin! I don't know what the few complaints about this place were really about... probably from competitors or people not use to quality pizza... \"Soggy pizza\"?! Seriously?! It was crisp! If you want soggy pizza go to Oregano's... Worst pizza EVER!!! Yes, the sauce is a bit on the sweet side and not for people used to cheep @#$& pizza. Yes, the place is small but would you rather have something mass produced, frozen and reheated like most fast food pizza places that sell for $5? Solve that problem by calling ahead! I've not had any problem with the staff... Excellent family atmosphere and great Italian personality!"}
{"text":"There was a lot of hype for me to come check out Spinato's.  Being full blooded Italian, I'm a authentic pizza snob; I'll admit.  

First off, anyplace that cuts their pizzas in squares is already being compared with Little C and Oregano.  
Secondly, when your sauce has absolutely no flavor to it at all! 
Lastly, what's up with the tomato paste being decorative design on top?? Again, no flavor and no where in Italy would you find that happening.

Server was good but sadly didn't save this being my one and only visit."}
{"text":"Fabulous!  We come for Spring Training every year and have to hit them up a couple of times each visit!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Spinato's for YEARS.  I live in Central Phoenix, and I do get out and try the more \"upper crust\" (pun intended) pizza places that are opening up around me.  Sorry Charlies, Spinato's may not have been featured in Bon Appetit or...but it is the best pizza in town.  

I'm not much of a crust fan (goes to my hips!), but their thin crust is THIN and has just the right about of tooth and crunch.  They never skimp on ingredients...They go out to the full perimeter of the pizza and are beyond delicious.

What is really the clincher, for me, is the tomato sauce.  It has a tad bit of sweetness to it, which really compliments the toppings.

I have some left over from last night and I'd better stop and go have a piece!  I enjoy going to the restaurant because you get it piping hot, but it is good delivered as well.  They are expanding the restaurant to their new location @ 7th St. & Missouri.  

I've been meaning to write this for a long time.  Check it out for yourself.  I doubt you'll be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Small pizza is a good deal during happy hour and is a generous portion for one person. The super six pizza was awesome. We dined there and the only downside was that it took them quite a while to bring our food out. I will be going back soon and would definitely recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"We dropped in after a movie at Tempe Marketplace at the insistence of Dave who had been here as a local.  They were just about closed and it was 100 degrees out but they still let us in.  Service was exceptional, waters filled every minute they were emptied.  

I asked and got a great recommendation on the $9 Calzone and it was absolutely fantastic and came quickly.  Ricotta cheese, onions, 3 types of peppers and that thin, wonderful crunchy crust.  I hadn't a Calzone this phenomenal in years.  The crust was light and tasty and they included Au Jus which was a different but nice touch

I did taste the pizza the guys ordered and I understand some of the Yelp comments about the tomato sauce being too sweet.  I still enjoyed the pizza but if you don't care for sweet spicey tomato sauce I would highly recommend the Calzone"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Some of, if not the the best in the valley. I love the slightly sweet but still tangy sauce. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Once again the greater Phoenix area does not disappoint when it comes to pizza. 

I would have never found this place if not for Yelp. It was tucked away and off the beaten path. The pizza choices were excellent and the service was very good. After I was done someone who I assume was the manager came over and asked how things were. I told him very good and I told him how I've been to Chicago, New York, Boston, San Fransisco, etc and in my opinion the Phoenix area competes with them all for pizza, if not beats them.

I would like to give this place 4.5 or 5 stars there was only 1 draw back, no beer or wine is served. So I gave it 4."}
{"text":"Took the kids there last night (10-21-10).

We enjoyed the food.  I had the \"Chicago\" pizza which had red and green bell peppers, onions, sausage.  It was very good.  I just now had the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  

My daughter had the Spaghetti Calzone, and was not overwhelmed by the taste, really.  She picked at it, but said it was good - just not \"blow her socks off\" good.

There is all this talk by Yelp reviewers of the \"sweetness\" of the sauce at Spinatos, and they are correct - the sauce has a MILDLY sweet flavor.  It's not overwhelmingly sugary sweet at all.  After all the comments, I expected it to taste like tomato candy.  But it was just sorta sweet-ISH.  Some people talk about how \"sweet\" the sauce at Papa John's is, and I have never really noticed that sweetness.  Although I did notice the Spinatos sweetness, it did not negatively affect the taste of the pizza AT ALL.

The pizza was better for breakfast than it was for dinner last night.  :)

One other major plus:  The \"Italian Bread and Butter\" that is on the appetizer menu for $1.89 if worth every penny, and more.  Very fresh bread, baked daily by a local bakery, good hard brown crust, and plenty of cold tub butter to spread on it.  It was excellent.

All in all, Spinatos is indeed one of the best pizzas I have had in Phoenix - definitely in the Top Five."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona for 6 years but it took leaving and coming back for a visit to discover this hidden gem.  The pizza and service were great.  It was a little spendy for a pizza but the quality of ingredients made it worth it."}
{"text":"Beyonddddd some of the best friggin' pizza I have ever eaten!! Phoenix, OMG, can Dallas have this place? The crust is crispy and the Ingredients are beyond fresh! 

Looks a little shady outside but it's like 10 times better once you go in! 

Whoever owns this place, lets get a location in Tejas please!"}
{"text":"We had an amazing meal here! The food was excellent, as was the service. At one point after our server walked away I turned to my husband and said, \"She is in the right job!\" Maria was great, handled our son's food allergy with ease (so that we were comfortable), and added to the overall experience. We highly recommend Spinato's in Tempe."}
{"text":"I ordered garlic bread with mozzerella cheese, basil and roma tomatoes. and it was yummy. 
:)
However I ordered one of their pizzas and it was sooo horribly salty it was like they accidentally emptied the salt shaker on it. Nicole's New Favorite, it was called. UGH. 

In hindsight I should have complained but I had another pizza which was also a tad salty - The Super Six - so I just ate most of that instead. 

I had the cannoli which was quite nice - it was my first time ever trying such a dessert so I didn't know what to expect.

nevertheless, I expected more from this place."}
{"text":"Hnnngffff their signature spinach pizza
It's the only thing I've ever ordered there
And it alone warrants 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at Spinato's Saturday night. The food and service was awesome. We started out with garlic and cheese breadsticks with marinara. Orgasimic. :) There were three of us dining, and we ordered three different things to share. I have had their meatball pizza several times, and it is my absolute favorite. We also tried the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone with ricotta. Oh my! This calzone was like heaven in your mouth. It was awesome, but a tad on the rich side. A few bites of this were enough to share. We also got an Italian sausage and mushroom pizza. It was also extremely good. Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, and was very helpful in explaining items on the menu. On top of all of this, it was very affordable."}
{"text":"Maria was amazing! Along with the food! She was very knowledgeable about the food and even when I had a gluten free allergy she was fully informed.  They have great gluten free options and everyone enjoyed their food. The marinara alone is worth coming for."}
{"text":"5 stars. Everytime. My family has been coming to Spinato's since I was a kid and have never had a less than delicious pizza. I now bring my own kids here and they love it too. 
I love toppings but the cheese pizza is stellar. The meatball trio is to excellent. 
Can't say enough good things. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I was craving great pizza and this place was recommended by a friend so I went to check it out. The service was awful and was given by high schoolers who obviously had more important things to be doing. I think they must of screwed up the batch of sauce because it was so sweet I couldn't even have bite number 2. I don't like sweet marinara or pizza sauce. The party I was with was a bit less picky but needless to say we didn't box the left overs which were plentiful."}
{"text":"I go this Spinato's frequently for lunch.  The pie is always fresh, therefore it takes a little time.  I like their sausage.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  I would go more often, but I always over eat!  I've never had their thick crust, but their thin is very good."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday evening, and ordered a medium size pie of \"L'Italiana, Mamma's Award-Winning Other Signature.\" I'm a huge fan of feta cheese, and they complimented very well with the roasted red peppers and spinach. I can understand why the other reviewers felt that the pizza sauce was copiously sweet. It is very sweet, but at least it balanced very well with my order! I would forewarn those who want to order the hawaiian style of pizza because it could be a sugar overkill. Overall, I'd come back here again :)"}
{"text":"Read the reviews, and they were right. This place is outstanding. Great service and the spaghetti calzone was delicious."}
{"text":"Phoenix continues to flex its muscle as a haven for Pizza.  This long time favorite provides a great comfortable, unpretentious atmosphere...surprising since it is in the middle of a Tempe industrial park.  The thin crust tastes like it has a dash of honey, the sauce is a great complement.  And that spaghetti calzone...let's just say that I wouldn't be surprised if other smart pizza joints don't start making it.

Like everything else, there is more than one way to enjoy pizza. This isn't your typical wood fired Neapolitan, coal fired New York, or Chicago deep dish.  It is somewhat unique, it is very memorable, and it is should have a comfortable home within your pizza shortlist."}
{"text":"Great little Chicago joint right here in Tempe. Great atmosphere and service. Amazing Greek salad, very fresh and tasty. The pizza was outstanding! Got the large meats. Thin crust was just right. The meats were very high quality and delicious! The sauce was a unique sweet sauce. Overall a great find! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Deathly delicious!!!!!!!!  The pizza sauce is super tasty, the thin crust is really good, the ingredients are fresh, the salad dressing is top notch and the service was fast and friendly!  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Kinda hard to find but well worth it. This one has no alcohol and herd somewhere they will soon. If you want to eat it at home, its better to call and pick it up then delivery. Delivery takes much longer."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try it because people rave. NOT a fan. I guess if you like super sweet sauce it will be up your alley. I couldn't eat it. I will stick to Joe's pizza or Slice of Sicily, pay much less and enjoy much more."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for years and I'm sorry I hadn't sooner!  The 3 of us split the atipasto salad, which was amazing, along with a L'Italiana pizza.  The pizza was marinated spinach, cheese, and roasted red pepper in a great red sauce.  We added jalepenos.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Hidden inside an industrial strip mall, this is a very small restaurant compared to the other Spinato's locations, and nowhere near as nice in terms of the decor or atmosphere. But, the food is pretty much the same as the other locations.

Spinato's makes a good pizza, but I do find the sauce to be a little too sweet for me.  However, the quality is very good and so is the service."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The ingredients are fresh and the flavors are explosive! When I order for take-out, even after only 10 minutes of a drive in my car, my car ends up smelling like the pizza for 2 full weeks! The antipasto wasn't much to write home about as the house Italian dressing wasn't very flavorful, but the 2 spinach pizzas are AMAZING.  I also just tried the Chicago last night and it was so so good.  Check this place out for eat in or for take-out.  Just expect your car to smell like this stuff for 2 weeks."}
{"text":"Things I ordered - 
Garlic bread, no cheese opted - Really crisp on the outside, delicious and mouth watering on the inside.
Vegetarian pizza, 7''- Tiny delicious pizz

Good ambience, nice metal music and not crowded."}
{"text":"Spinato's has, by far, the BEST pizza I've ever had. Their spaghetti calzone is my absolute favorite. The Tempe location in particular has a wonderful atmosphere. The staff is friendly and really makes it more of an experience. It is a little tricky to find the place unless you've been there before. But once you find it, you'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Ech!  Why do so many people rave about this place?!  It's just OK.  Not horrible, but slightly above average.  if you like very sweet tomato sauce on your pizza then you may like Spinatos.  I wanted to like this pizza, in fact I've ordered it twice just to be sure I wasn't crazy.  

I love Chicago style pizza, but I also love any thin crust pizza, including NY style... basically I just love pizza, so I'm not biased in anyway.  I just think the sauce is very strange tasting!  

I've heard the meatball sub is good, but I'm just not diggin' the tomato sauce.  The first piece may be OK, but the sauce and it's odd sweetness really loses me."}
{"text":"There is no guess work here....Welcome to Chicago.....this is truly Chicago Italian Cusine.
Come for the Pizza but everything on the menu is authentic, you won't be dissapointed."}
{"text":"I would have written a 5-star review about Spinato's anyway, but after an experience this weekend, I had to Yelp about it ASAP....  I drove from Mesa just to pick up pizza for my family (yes, it's that good), and when I was getting in my car to leave, I was holding the pizza and the box caught the corner of my rear-view mirror.  The entire large pizza spilled in the front seat of my car, all over the console, gear shift, seat, floor, etc.  It was a mess!  I tried to clean it up, but I really needed soap and water, so I went in to ask for some napkins.  The manager, Tim, overheard me ask and asked what happened.  When I explained, he immediately got me wet towels to clean up the mess and made me a new pizza, free of additional charge!  He obviously didn't have to do that, as it was not Spinato's fault in any way.  Plus, the place was packed (as usual), but he bumped my pizza to the front of the line.  If I wasn't convinced before that Spinato's is the BEST-- not just for food taste but for customer service-- I would be sure of it now!

Things to get:  the Sicilian pizza.  It's thick and awesome.  Order jalapenos on top.  They are a nice balance to the sweet sauce.  Also, get the starter salad and the raspberry vinaigrette dressing-- it's tart and perfect.

Something unique:  the spaghetti-filled calzone.  Yep, you heard me-- carbs baked inside of carbs!  :)

The servers are great, the management is great, the location is great (easy parking and plenty of it, including street parking), and the food is SO WONDERFUL!  Try one of their multiple locations throughout the valley-- you won't be disappointed.

Tip:  they don't take lunch reservations, but if you get there earlier than your appointed time, they have no problem pulling together multiple tables for larger groups."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. There's no alcohol but the food more than made up for that. The Best Marinara I've ever had. We had the garlic bread, Greek salad, stuffed mushrooms and pizza. It was all delicious!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Tastes exactly like store bought microwave pizza or cafeteria pizza to be exact. Really bad. Don't know why people like it. I think they've just never had good pizza. The sauce is really bad too. Tastes like chef Boyardee. Disgusting!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza joints in the valley, the pizzas are Fantastic but the sauce is what makes them over the top. The pizza sauce is a family recipe made in house everyday and it's top secret. Everything on the menu is great!

We will continue to be back time after time again"}
{"text":"We went to Spinato's tonight for dinner. I really can't say enough good things about the food and service. I am from Indiana. There is a pizza place in Indiana and Illinois called Aurelio's. The pizza there is superb. Apparently, Mr. Spinato and Mr. Aurelio worked together in the pizza business, and opened the first Spinato's in AZ together. My mother is visiting from Indiana, and I wanted to taste pizza that reminded her of home. She loved it. We all loved. My mother and I split a medium pizza. My half was Mama Spinato's signature fresh spinach and hers was the Chicago. My husband had a medium Nicole's new favorite. All of the pizza was amazing. Before dinner In ordered a dinner salad. I figured it would keep me from devouring my whole pizza. The salad was also really good. Throughout our meal, our server, Madison stopped by frequently to ask how things were and to see if we needed anything. She was the best waitress we have had in a long time. All in all, it was a great experience. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One if the best mouth watering pizza I have ever tasted. In days after my first visit, I am already back for more. You don't even need to read my review to see how good this place is. There are tons of people raving this place. The only stuff I can add is this

\"NO MATTER WHAT YOU ORDER, YOU NEED TO TRY THE SPAGHETTI CALZONE\"

If that does not blow your mind then I don't what would. Another tip, the other spinatos places seems to have lower stars. I don't know why but I have not even dare to try them. I live like 11 miles on other spinatos  and this is like 16 miles away. We choose this."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Spinatos at this location. We LOVE the spaghetti calzone and of course had to order it again! We are also a fan of the super six pizza and enjoyed that during this visit too! 

The restaurant seems out of place nestled in an industrial park and the parking is pretty limited too. The atmosphere at the Tempe location is a lot different from the Bell location- much simpler. Unfortunately during this visit our order took an exceptionally long time to come out (over 45 min) but the folks were super attentive keeping all of our drinks full and fresh!"}
{"text":"This was the one Spinato's I had yet to visit and now I can finally cross it off my list! Sunday night rolled around and it was a pizza kind of night. When it comes to takeout pizza, Spinato's is at the top of our list but we were faced with the pining question: What location is closest? We decided that this location was the best choice and made our way down to this hidden pizza gem within an industrial setting. 

This Spinato's doesn't have the frills but it has the food! The delicious sweet sauce, the heavenly sausage and the fluffy bread. I gobble up every bite and I'm sad when it's over! It's best to ask for extra sauce because their sauce is their signature taste. The pizza is also perfect for left-overs so I suggest getting a larger one so you have some for the next day! We got the bruschetta to start and really enjoyed the fluffy bread and flavorful tomatoes and peppercinis. 

I love this pizza and think everyone in the Valley should try it because they will fall in love too!"}
{"text":"I have an obsession with Spinato's pizza. It could have something to do with the sauce, or the homemade Italian sausages or the soft chewy pizza dough, but whatever it is, I just can't get enough. This past weekend, I finally had the chance to visit this location. We dined in the intimate dining room amongst families enjoying a pizza on the town. The service was on par, the atmosphere was nice but the best part of the night was the delicious pizza. It's so good I force myself to enter a food coma just to have another piece. The pizza is Chicago thin-crust pizza with fluffy and soft square pieces of pizza with their signature sweet pizza sauce that makes their pizza what it is. For pizza parlor pizza, this is hands down my favorite. I just wish they had one closer to where I lived!

News alert: While there, I learned that they are moving locations in the next couple weeks, so before you visit, give them a call to make sure they haven't moved locations yet!"}
{"text":"WOW! This IS the best pizza in Phoenix.
I personally am not a fan of thin crust BUT this place changed My mind.
We were going to get the thick crust until we noticed EVERY table had ordered the thin crust.
The sauce is AMAZING! We even bought some to take home.
The service was quite attentive as well.
The night we came they had beer specials. Hooray for specials!
I travel nationwide ALOT and have been on the quest for the best pizza in Phoenix for about 2 years now. THIS IS IT!
I just wish they delivered to My house. They did mention that several people order delivery outside the coverage area and meet them at a gas station (QT and circle K) to pick up pizza. 
Talk about going above and beyond for customer service.
WE WILL BE BACK and bringing more friends next time.
Like that it was LGBTQ friendly.
Thanks Spinato's!"}
{"text":"LOVE the pizza here. It reminds me of being that fat little kid who loves pepperoni pizza, you know the one.. he's got pizza sauce all over his face and doesnt care what anyone else thinks! 

Now that I'm a fat little man, I still get the same pleasure out of the pizza at Spinato's, you know the pleasure.. you've got pizza sauce all over your face and you don't care what anyone else thinks!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Sweeter style sauce and it's bangin! Fast delivery and always friendly, one of my valley favorites!"}
{"text":"There are a lot of great pizza places here in the Phoenix area right now, and for me, this is one of the best.  Spinato's is not the wood-fired oven style of pizza that is super popular right now, so if that's what you're looking for, try one of other hot spots.  BUT what they do at Spinato's, they do so, so right. This is a Chicago-style pizza (the family is from there originally).  My favorite is the Super Six, but I also really love the L'Italiana.  If you're hungry, try the garlic breadsticks, which are served with a side of marinara sauce.  Finally, in terms of service, I've never had a bad experience.  If you're a pizza lover, I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The cheesy garlic bread is a must have!  We had a large pizza and it was amazing!  Cooked to perfection and loaded with flavor. This may be my new favorite pizza place!"}
{"text":"Best Sicilian za in town! Great place to take a date. But I recommend the one on Glendale (they serve alcohol there)."}
{"text":"Pizza is very overpriced.  It's pretty good, but I personally prefer Oregano's on University Rd. compared to this pizza joint.  Also, the pizza cut up my gums pretty badly (a little surprising).  In terms of value, I'd say the pizza is pretty good, but if you're a college student on any sort of budget, take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Gluten Free Pizza! 
Even the gluten free garlic bread was good! 
I love their sauce... its sweet! :)"}
{"text":"#1 pizza in Tempe - perfect flavorful crust and sauce and cooked to perfection. My fave is the super six (well done). Just wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Food was really good I recommend the cheesy garlic bread! The Cesar salad was amazing. But the pizza omg sooooo cheesy and delicious."}
{"text":"Wow, the \"mamma's spinach\" pizza was really good! Garlic, spinach, & fresh tomatoes was great, even 2 days later."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza in the valley. The sauce is on the sweeter side and absolutely compliments the other ingredients.

My favorite dishes here are sausage and jalape√±o thin crust pizza (but all of their crusts are just as delicious) and The Wrigley hot sandwich.

My workplace is close by and when we're in the office on Saturdays or an evening event this is a staple of Italian dining activities. Delivery is usually within an hour or so and is well worth the wait. The delivery has never arrived cold and is piping hot.

I have dined at this location on several occasions and the wait staff is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Had a really good experience. Was in town visiting and my dad took me here. Great tasting Pizza and their happy hour menu rocked. Their garlic bread mozzarella is to die for, their sauce is a bit tricky and isn't regular Pizza sauce, it's a bit sweeter, I have it a4 start because I wasn't 100% crazy about the sauce but I'm also very picky lol. I recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"After trying pizzas in NY, Chicago, SF spinatos is the best pizza in the country. Da Greek, Nicoles new favorite, and super 6 are the best I've had.  I highly recommend trying the spaghetti calzone sm size and Wrigley sandwich :) everything is pretty amazing.  after 5 years I've still not found a better pizza place.

Also Maria, one of the staff is a true sweetheart.  She's honest, happy and a breath of sweet family everytime I see her :)  if you're there on Tues you'll have the pleasure of seeing her!"}
{"text":"Tough to find but worth the effort. It's in the shopping center just south of Tempe Marketplace. The pizza is very tasty and the service is good."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mamma Spinach Pizza, thin crust. All we could taste was the garlic! We actually like garlic, but this was TOO much! The sauce was sweeter than we liked, which I had read from previous reviews.  When ordering online, the system says they wouldn't deliver (we live 3 miles away). I called and found out they did deliver.

The only reason for the two stars is because the service was good. The girl who took my order was very nice :), and the delivery guy was just as nice and very quick!  We probably won't order from here again; it's just not our style of favors."}
{"text":"Ah-Fricken-Mazing..... My friend had mentioned to me that this pizza place called \"Spinatos\" made a baked spaghetti calzone... Being preggo this sounded like the best thing EVER MADE! Last week i ordered one for lunch as take out. The guy who took my order was so nice, not the usual \"I can give a rat's @$$\" college student worker. When I picked it up ALL of the employees were on their game as far as customer service goes. The food...  it was very good. The crust tasted fresh and perfectly cooked, the spaghetti inside was tender, and the sausage was sweet and full of flavor. I can not wait to try their pizza! I will be back... very very soon."}
{"text":"Their gluten-free cheese pizza is not only the best GF pizza I've ever had, but the best pizza I've ever had in general! The sauce is a little on the sweeter side and goes perfectly with the rest of the ingredients in the pizza. The strawberry gorgonzola salad is the best salad I've ever had in my life (if you go during happy hour it is half off!) with its amazing sweet strawberry dressing. I just tried their cannoli for the first time and it was honestly the best cannoli I've ever had. It seems like everything here is delicious!"}
{"text":"Yu-u-u-M!  The sauce is a sweet and not too acidic and the spaghetti and meatball calzone (add ricotta) is cravable! I saw the meatball sandwich and can't believe a single human being could consume one on their own. I swear it must be three pounds of meatballs on a full french loaf! I only wish they were open for lunch on Sundays because for some reason that's when I always think, \"Yum! A spaghetti and meatball calzone would be great right now.\" Oh well. My loss, I suppose..."}
{"text":"Setting was dark and older style. Pizza had great flavor but not a thin crisp style but rather a hand tossed pizza. No TVs for game watching. Server messed up my order but not subtracting for that as it happens and he was nice about it. Service was actually very attentive and solid follow up. Only three stars as pizza was average to me and didn't care for the setting."}
{"text":"It's probably my favorite pizza in Arizona.  They use great ingredients and you can just taste the quality.  It costs more than most places, but that's because it's good and they pay more for better quality ingredients.  It's worth it."}
{"text":"I am BEYOND obsessed. 
Their gluten free pizza is amazing. Most gluten free is thin & dry. Spinato's gluten free is like a true pizza crust: fluffy, hydrated, crunchy bottom, perfect! 
My favorite pizzas: Nicole's old favorite, Nicole's new favorite, chicken presto pesto. Their tomato sauce is extremely flavorful too.
Ordering online for pickup is very easy."}
{"text":"I was in town for business and was craving pizza to take back to the hotel. I ordered a thin crust Chicago and a side greek salad. The salad was actually really very good, and the home made dressing was surprisingly delish. The pizza wasn't very thin in my books (I was looking for a cracker-thin crust), and there was just way too much cheese. Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but it was to the point of you-can't-see-the-toppings-toomuch-cheese. Also, they had forgotten to cut my pizza lol. No big, I had silverware from my salad, but who forgets to cut a pizza?

If you're looking for a sweeter sauce and to support a family-run pizzeria, this is the place for you. I'd come back again if I'm craving a regular crust pizza, just not the thin."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Spinatos and an unhealthy percentage of my excess weight was probably originally their offerings.  But I'm sad to report that today is a dark day for pizza lovers: I've just learned that Spinatos no longer offers green olives on their pizzas.  Their very best pizza has always been italian sausage, green olives, and extra cheese.  Now they've robbed me of that heaven.  I guess I'll probably live a bit longer now, since I'm way less interested in their pizza without those salty green olives. Still, a big disappointment.  Get on the ball Spinatos--I used to love you."}
{"text":"We tried to come here for dinner two nights in a row. The first night was the day before the Phoenix marathon, and it was packed (runners love to carbo load). The next night weather learned and came earlier and only had a short wait. They have a nice text message waiting service so you can wait outside or in your car. 

Great vibe to this restaurant. Everyone who greeted us/waitress was very nice, and you could tell this is a Family-friendly restaurant, mom-and-pop style. We both got calzones. As someone who grew up in NY (me), and my husband (outside Chicago), we thought the calzones were OK. My cream vodka sauce was so sweet I almost wanted to salt it. Maybe just a fluke night. I will definitely try again if we are back in the area though."}
{"text":"I hadn't had spinatos too many times before and couldn't remember if I liked it. Tried it again yesterday, turns out I'm a fan! 
We ordered pick up here on a Saturday night, and it was ready in a reasonable amount of time! We got the Italiana pizza, I think that is what it was called. It had mozzarella, feta, red peppers, and spinach. The toppings were all soooo good together. A very yummy combination of flavors. My only complaint was that the dough seemed a tad bit soggy. But overall I really liked it, and pretty much inhaled half of a large pizza haha oops. There were some other veggie ones that sounded awesome as well so I will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  The service is great and the pizza is very, very good.  Our server was friendly, courteous and checked on us at all the right times.  I would say the price range is average.  It's a super casual place, so you wouldn't look out of place if you walked in there with your hair uncombed wearing sweats. They do not serve alcohol, but they do have a killer brownie and gelato.  The garlic bread appetizer is simple, but yummy.  We had a large pizza with half what I wanted and half what my friend wanted.  The thing I tend to dislike about pizza places (but worth it if the pizza is fantastic) is the wait once you order it.  The pizza was brought to us in about only 10 minutes.  Very impressed with the whole thing.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is first, the tables were too close together.  I'm not loud, but I shouldn't have to whisper either, so there really is no seat in the place to have a private discussion with your party.  I understand they want as much business as they can, but when the lady at the table next to me snickers at something I said, I think it's time to take a table or two out.  Second, I like my crust with a little bit of a crisp or crunch.  This pizza crust was really soft. It might be more a preference issue though, so more of a heads up if you like it the way I like it.   Now, if only they had a small wine selection to complete the package.  :)"}
{"text":"Each item on the menu is delicious! My favorite is their gluten-free pizza!!! Best pizza place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night 6/12. First time I had a bad experience here. They were not very busy so there's no excuse for the things that happened. I ordered a item off the menu that has many choices. Which I had no idea based on how it was wrote on the menu. Server brought it out to me having not asked which one I wanted. Super annoying to find that out during the meal. Pizza was only half cooked and they have become so skimpy on the toppings I will not go there anymore. The second issue I had was a new server there had the worst attitude I've seen there. we stared right at him on our way out and he didn't even say bye. constantly got in peoples way as they were trying to sit down. Really dissapointed won't go back."}
{"text":"Neighborhood pizzaria right across from my other favorite, Pat's Pizza.  Pat's excels at the New York thin crust while Spinato's has a great deep dish Chicago version that is excellent and not at all greasy.  The sauces (both the pizza and the pasta) are great and you can get extra on the side.  In the rare event you are still hungry I'd say get frozen yogurt across the street and skip the desserts which are a bit weak.  But how can you not love a family restaurant that feels like every pizza place in America?"}
{"text":"Just a few days late on my review but I didnt forget about them. This place is amazing!!! Awesome food, awesome server  and awesome service!! First time here and I was very pleased. It looks small from the outside but it's fairly big inside. The food is not the only reason I would go back but the server she was sooo cool, you could tell she loved her job and wanted you to feel comfortable and at home. I would go back just to hear how her vacation went!"}
{"text":"I have only gotten delivery from here before but every time I am impressed. The people who take my order are great and the food is always hot when it arrives. The pizza is the best by far that I have had since living in Arizona. The calzones are also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizzas - light with a great thin crust and fresh vegetables and meat on it. They mixed up our order slightly and gave us a whole second pizza for free- way above and beyond."}
{"text":"Ok, If you love pizza you gotta go to Spinato's !! 

I first tried their pizza at the Taste Of Tempe last spring and ya maybe I was really boozed up on cider beer but with free food everywhere I continued to find myself over at the Spinato area the majority of the time. Their pizza is orgasmic, and that's not a word I throw around often.

However, a few downers, one they are still doing construction work in the restaurant in Tempe but get over it, the pizza makes up for the way it looks! Second downer, they don't have their liquor license yet, but grab a 12-pack and drink  in your car while you wait for a table... because trust me, their always busy and you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"Pizza and service was very good. Nice thin crust which does not leave you with that guilty feeling after eating."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmm! get the mama's signature! and get a large one. you and your tummy will thank me later! it is chock-full of delectable garlic, spinach, and tomatoes. so simple, yet so mind-blowingly awesome.

it does get a bit soggy in the middle, but you can order the crust extra-crispy!"}
{"text":"Literally the best pizza I've had in Arizona... Thanks a lot Spinato's, now everything else tastes like crap. ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered online for take out. I got the margherita pizza and a spinach calzone. The pizza had no sauce on it. None. Not like any margherita I've ever had. The calzone had way too much garlic and it was really sweet. Also, everything was incredibly oily. Yuck. It was almost inedible. 

Also, there's a problem with their online ordering system. I ordered the pizza under my name. I had to set up an account with a password and everything. No big deal. When I placed my order the only option to pay was immediately instead of also at the pizza shop. My husband gave me his credit card to pay with and I did so. Still this is all fine other than the pizza shop losing out on a tipping opportunity but, whatever, not my business. When we got to Spinato's my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me if it could be under a different name and I said no I just set up my account and we already paid, what's going on with our order? Then as we're trying to figure out what happened we started going over what we ordered and then a man appeared with the food. My name was right on it. I pointed out that there's my name printed right on the piece of paper that's with the food. Then the lady behind the counter got a little condescending with her tone as she told me that the order is under the name on the credit card. I kept my name so me and my husband have different names. Why didn't she say this in the first place? Why the condescending tone? She might work there and know how the system is set up but, as a first time customer how would I? 

Also, if the food is under credit card name and they require that you pay online immediately when you order then why do I need an account unless they want to spam me for ordering food from them? or sell my info for extra $$"}
{"text":"Had 'Da Greek pizza... could be the best pizza I've ever had.  It was awesome. Not sure of all the toppings, but there was something semi-sweet which gave this pizza an unexpected (but very good) taste. The crust was perfect (not too thick, not too thin) and the toppings tasted very fresh. My order was to go but the staff was super friendly during my brief interaction. They also offered plates, napkins, forks, Parmesan and crushed red pepper which I appreciated since I was going back to eat in my office. Note: this place is a little difficult to find, especially at night, if you've never been. It's in a warehouse like area, but close to the street.

All in all, an excellent pizza and I'll definitely be back to try more of their pizza creations."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Pizza ever.  Just had it again last night and it was great.  Called ahead and picked it up.  You guys rock pizza.  Can't wait to try the new location...that has a different menu.  I've taken many people to try your pizza and they all agree that it's the Best."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza here is fantastic. I think my favorite thing though is the sauce. It's delicious! You can definitely taste the difference from the chain place.  I couldn't stop eating my pizza after I was plenty full. Would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and I know GOOD pizza.  Spinato's is my favorite pizza spot in the Valley.  The sauce is sweet, the crust is crispy, the toppings are always spot on (I always do meatball and mushroom).  Thanks to Spinatos for bringing a piece of my hometown to the Valley!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. The mamas signature pizza on gluten free crust is insanely good! And the spaghetti calzone is amazing too!!"}
{"text":"I lived right by here for years, never checking it out.  I recently ate here, and it was great.  Best pizza I have had yet in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The best pizza you will find in the valley hands down. Great customer service. The overall atmosphere is great. I always take my out-of-town friends and family members here and they are always blown away by how good it is. Try the Margherita pizza! It will blow your hair back..."}
{"text":"Have I mentioned I love these people!?!? So I was thinking I'd run by Tempe Marketplace for a few things after a ridiculously long day and then pick up dinner from my favorite place afterwards. 

I called to place my order and was helped by an incredibly helpful, friendly gal. Wish I got her name... She assured me my food would be waiting for me in  30. Awesome! Plenty of time for a quick stop at the Bev Mo! And hey! There's an Ulta right there, isn't there? I need hairspray... By the time I pick up dinner I'm late, annoyed and HUNGRY! I'm greeted warmly, served quickly and am on my way. 

Excited to get home, relax and enjoy some wine and great food. Open the bags to discover there's no dressing for my Greek salad and the caprese isn't what I expected. Lame.

I seriously hate being a complainer, even when justified. I called and explained the lack of dressing situation with the manager, Leslie. She insisted on having the dressing delivered to me and within 10 minutes, Matt arrives with more than I'd asked for and with cookies. 

I'm still quite shocked. Not once did anyone argue or make me feel like I was being annoying. Their primary focus was making sure I was happy and enjoyed my overall experience. Clearly customer service at it's finest. 

It's not just the amazing food that sets Spinatos apart. They truly care and you can tell."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in town. Owners are friendly and ALWAYS get our order right. We usually get the \"Other Signature\" and it is delicious! This place is justifiably popular, so if you are in a hurry, consider ordering take-out, otherwise plan for a wait."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place! I don't know if it was just because we were extra hungry, or what, but we couldn't stop talking about how amazing it all was while we were eating... Between my family members, we had chicken pesto pizza, Hawaiian pizza, meatball sub and a calzone. Everything was perfection! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"What the %$#@ just happened???  You have to try the \"Mama Spinatos signature fresh spinach pizza!!!   Fresh spinach, tomatoes, and a handful of fresh garlic,  It was like a flavor bomb hit my pie hole!  This pizza is so good you can't put it down 'til your lying fetal position on the couch because you ate so much.  This is chicago thin crust at its finest.  

I eat pizza, its what I do and this place has great thin crust.  Do yourself a favor and order a take-out, trust me.

I wish i could comment on the rest of the food.  The pizza is so good I can't seem to try anything else.

Edit: The pizza here puts Oregano's to shame."}
{"text":"This had to be one of the best gluten-free pizzas I have had.  It was really flavorful and didn't taste like cardboard.  The dipping sauce for the garlic bread was also outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm torn between a 3.5 and 4 star rating.  The pizza here is amazing, seriously. As I was eating it, I felt like I was in the scene with the corn on the cob in \"What about Bob\".  Spinato's has incredible pizza, the ingredients and sauce were spot on and rich in flavor.  Also this place has crushed ice, which I just love!!  

However, there were a few things that I didn't like about the place.  For one, it's tiny, meaning wait time will usually be a factor.  Once we finally were sat, it was at a really small table right in the middle of the room; I prefer a bit more of an intimate setting.  Our server was nice but not especially quick or observant; forgetting plates and silverware.  Our mixed iceberg/spinach salad was nothing to write home about; honestly it was the same quality as one of the salad bags you pick up in the grocery store.  The lettuce had a little bit of a earthy taste, almost like they didn't wash it before they served it.  This location does not serve wine or beer, which was a shame because I really would have loved a glass of red wine.  Lastly, we ended up with the cannoli for desert and I was not impressed at all; one bite was enough.  

I was really taken back with the amazing pizza, but the establishment was not my taste.  From now on I'll be taking Spinato's to go."}
{"text":"This pizza is not bad, but after reading some of the reviews saying that it is the best pizza in the country I was expecting to be blown away. Clearly the people saying that it is the best have never been to new haven ct!  The sauce was sweet but not bad tasting. Crust was ok. Service was friendly. Anyways it wasnt terrible and I will give it another shot, but I dont understand what all of the hype is. I would rate it a notch above average."}
{"text":"Pizza is very tasty but I have an issue with the bait and switch on their menu. I ordered the Super Six and basically was penalized because I substituted jalape√±o peppers for their mixed green & red sweet bell peppers and ham (which I'm sure the inventory cost of red/green peppers is more than jalape√±o peppers. Anyway my order went from ordering the speciality to a \"create your own\" because I took away 2 toppings (meat & veggie) of higher value for one veggie. Instead of the waiter recommending the best value I ended up spending close to $10 for a 4 slice mini personal pizza. They need to open a Mod or Blaze Pizza here where you have unlimited toppings for $7.99 small pizza."}
{"text":"great chicago style thin crust pizza with a sweet sauce cut into squares. simple as that!"}
{"text":"I enjoy good pizza and this place had a decent pie. The only real turn off was the poor service that I had. Seemed rushed and the employees were all standing around just kind of bored looking and not really engaged in the pizza place. I would go to over places in Tempe over this. Just not happy with service, rude, rushed, and not the kind of place I want to spend money at."}
{"text":"Uhhhh yum! It's Spinatos!! Been coming for years! The pizza is the bomb! I pretty sure it's in the sauce! The pizza is a thicker Chicago style pizza and it's soooo good! The caesar salad is great too! The place is cute and small and the staff is friendly and attentive!  A must for Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Traveling in Phoenix for the weekend and as our final meal, we ate at Spinato's at a friend's suggestion. We ordered the personal size of L'Italiana and Spaghetti with meatballs calzone.

Delicious!

The service was friendly and the manager (owner?) stopped by to check on us. My only regret is the size if calzone we ordered."}
{"text":"Pizza was good. I had the \"new\" favorite. However, what kind of pizza place doesn't serve alcohol or wings?! Went in wanting pizza, wings, and a beer. Left having only had the pizza."}
{"text":"Scrum-diddly-umptious. 

We were getting ready to buckle down for a tv marathon and so we chose Spinatos as the pizza to try.  We walked in and ordered take-out on a Sunday (we didn't call ahead because we were just getting back into town from up north and didn't have any menus). The place was pretty busy and there was no where for us to stand, let alone sit, so we went back to my car and waited for them to finish. (Note to self: order ahead of time for takeout and you won't have to deal with the wait)

I had never had their pizza, but my friend absolutely swears by it. Anywho...I decided to go with 'The Classic' on a thin crust and my friend went with the 'The Signature' also on a thin crust. Mine was delicious, but hers was unfreakingbelievable. It was absolutely perfect. 

The only downside for the experience was they didn't have tshirts in any adult sizes so we had to run down the street to Oreganos. Oh well!"}
{"text":"Ick!

Nothing like a 20 pound pizza full of oil & cheese.

You know its going to be bad when you pick it up & the box feels like its going to dissolve in your hands."}
{"text":"We waited for about an hour for a table.  It was well worth the wait!  The pizza and calzone were amazing.  Maria was a fantastic server!  We will definitely be back and bring others with us!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I heard that this place was amazing from some friends from school so we had to give it a try. 

Our waiter was awesome. It didn't occur us that it was happy hour so our waiter let us know that it would be more food and cheaper  for us to order our own small pizzas then attempt to half and half a medium. We ordered a Greek and  pesto chicken pizza as well as artichoke crostini. The crostini came out really quick and was really good. I would describe it as a large crostini with a thick, creamy artichoke dip on top. I think the appetizer would have been better had the slice of bread been a lot smaller with more slices or presliced. 

The pizza took a little longer to come out but that is expected with pizza and it was worth the wait! As soon as the pizzas hit the table, we were informed that our Greek pizza did not have onions because the kitchen forgot so we were given two options. They could either make us a whole new one for free and we can have the one on the table or they can cook onions and put it on there. I'm a poor grad student so I opted for the free pizza. Plus, it just wouldn't be the same with hot onions going onto my already cooling pizza. Normally, when I go to pizza places there's tons of sauce and barely any topping. Here there is light sauce and tons of toppings! The pizza is also cut into squares instead of the typical slices. This was nice since it made each slice easy to eat. Our waiter suggested we order our Greek pizza extra crispy (we ended up ordering both extra crispy) since there was spinach on top that could make the crust a little soggy. I felt like he took great pride in the quality of food that came out. For both pizzas, the toppings were fresh and the crusts were crispy. The pizzas flavors were well balanced and flowed really nicely. My boyfriend preferred the Greek and I preferred the pesto chicken, but over all both were delicious!! 

For dessert, we had the cannoli. The pastry part was crisp and had a nice crunch to it. The cream inside was perfect! It was sweet but not too sweet and had chocolate shavings inside. I don't know if they make it in house or not but I hope so because the thought of that makes it so much better. Overall, great experience, great service, and most importantly great food!!"}
{"text":"As a Chicagoan, I can sometimes be a bit of a pizza snob. It just happens when you grow up with amazing pizza. And, though I've lived all over since then, anytime I move somewhere finding good pizza becomes a necessity. I've been visiting Spinato's for awhile now and hadn't reviewed them yet. Why I don't know, I can only blame the food coma I'm usually in after my visits.

I should mention I've been to three locations and my experience has always been the same -  which is both rare and awesome.

If you're a fan of thin and crispy pizza, you must check them out. Their sauce is fantastic, and they've got great pizza down to a science. They will also brown your pizza a bit for you if you like your cheese that lovely golden brown color.

Their garlic cheese bread absolutely puts all others to shame. Get it, splurge, you're already eating pizza, so go all out. It is SO good. Note the capital SO.

Spinato's is definitely top 3 in the Valley for thin crust, check them out, they have several locations. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"The food is good, but I just can't get into the sweetness of the pizza sauce.  I will try it again, maybe a pizza without the red sauce.  Bread was great, salad also great!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again."}
{"text":"Last week we ordered a pizza for delivery, one of their specialty spinach pizzas and asked to add sausage to ONE SIDE ONLY as I am a vegetarian and my boyfriend is not.  The girl on the phone assured me they could do this. Pizza is delivered, sausage over the WHOLE THING. Thanks for nothing. Tonight my boyfriend convinced me to try it again so we ordered a half Greek pizza and half spinach with sausage on only the spinach side. Again the girl confirmed that this would be no problem. Pizza comes, SAUSAGE OVER EVERYTHING. So again, I didn't eat.  Seriously, how hard it is to not mess up a pizza order? Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"The Excellent: 
* Spicy Italian, with added Feta and Black Olives. Yum. 

The good: 
* Price was a little high, but it was a delicious pizza... Price would have been better a few bucks cheaper. Delivery fee is high ($5). 

The Bad: 
* I had a hard time finding a current menu on their website - The link doesn't work. This lead me to order a thin crust pizza I didn't know was thin crust (I prefer thick). But hey it was awesome, so no big deal. 

Overall though, awesome pizza, and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"North Central Phoenix is home to some great pizzarias. The 12th Street corridor has Stumpy's, Isa's pizza now anchors the northern gates of Sunnyslope.....and Spinato's is on the southern edge of the 'Slope. Great pizza, though I am not a fan of the \"Mama's signature\" (sauce is too sweet for my taste), I like their \"Get Meaty\" pie and the \"spicy italian\". Salads are good. They have a wine special on Wednesday's that's pretty sweet (50% off on bottles, I beleive)."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. Giant tasty portions. Our server was super funny and extremely helpful. She answered all of our questions fast and gave us her personal recomendations. Everything was great. We have been back several times and will continue to do so. This is the best pizza in Tempe!"}
{"text":"Pro tip: order the Greek with half marinara, half olive oil, no olives, with pineapple, and extra crispy crust (it makes picking it up manageable). 

Not only is it delicious but ordering it is a real panty dropper. 

I'm not sure that I would call this pizza. Don't get me wrong, it's wildly good. But if I'm craving pizza I'm going to Otto's on Ash. But whatever this is- it's amazing."}
{"text":"Meet up with some fellow yelpin friends on Thursday night at Spinato's Pizza.  I didn't even know Spinato's was there and very close to Tempe Marketplace, I just thought this was an industrial area.  This Spinato's has an opened feeling to it, its rustic yet industrial, guess so it can fit in its surroundings.  I also learned this location does not sell beer or wine or whatever booze they happen to have for sale at other locations.  

I was running a little behind but I did get to sample the signature pizza, it had baby spinach, fresh roma tomatoes, diced garlic and mozzarella cheese, thick crust. This was a great pizza, simple but delish! The pizza sauce is on the sweeter side, not savory, but I personally happen to like it I also happen to be a fan of thick crust pizza as well, I'm not too crazy about thin crust, so this pizza was perfect in my book!  

Service was great and food was good! Look forward to trying it again."}
{"text":"**Vegetarian Friendly**

Great little Italian/pizza place for everyone! It's very easy to miss because of its location, so look for their van parked outside!

Appetizer: Artichoke Crostini
If you love spinach and artichoke dip, you'll love this! Wish it were either smaller crostini pieces, or cut into strips to make sharing easier. Happy hour portion comes with 2 crostini, regular portion comes with 3. 

Pizza: Chicken Presto Pizza (minus the chicken) and L'Italiana (Mamma's Award Winning Signature)
Both pizzas were mouthwatering and scrumptious! I love that pizza is served on a cooling rack because it lets the hot air escape while letting the pizza develop a nice crisp. I recommend do not get the basil pesto drizzle on top as it made the pizza too pesto-y and oily for my taste, but overall still a delicious pizza. The L'Italian absolutely blew me away! The sauce was fresh and has a secret ingredient that I couldn't get enough of. 

Dessert: Chocolate Chip Cookie
I absolutely love that you can purchase just one cookie for $1. Perfect sized dessert too. Unfortunately my cookie wasn't as soft and gooey I was hoping for, I think mine was a tad over-baked. 

They have tons of gluten free options; they even designate it with a symbol on their menu. 

Great service. My waiter/host (Kyle and Spencer) were very attentive and gave a great family feel to the restaurant. Overall, I will definitely go back. I can't wait to have their calzone next time!"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. My sister is following a gluten free/dairy free diet for the next 6 weeks per Doctor orders. This makes eating out a tad difficult. We found this place via google randomly and decided to try it. My sister got the gluten free pizza crust with pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and red sauce. The pizza was so good that once she is back on dairy and gluten again she may still order this same pizza. I ordered their meatball sub with their house wine. You would not expect a strip mall Italian restaurant to be so good. However, we will definitely be back as the customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"i dont know how alot of people gave this place great reviews for \"CHICAGO\" pizza or pizz for that matter... not even close. i was actually pretty depressed after just smelling the pizza when they laid it on the table.and then the dreaded first bite.the crust had a pretzel taste to it.. yes a pretzel taste. and my son described the sauce as tasting like campbells tomato soup....i had wanted to go to this restaurant for some time cause alot of reviews said it was the closest to chicago pizza... i dont know where these people come from, but i am not taking another persons review of a pizza place out here again.  i have spent more money on bad pizza than i like to think about. hopefully the rosatis up on 92st and shea has the same manager they had 10-12 years ago cause thats where im heading next.and this place was actually packed... i dont get it.. am i the only person out here that appreciates a good pie? idk??? the waitress and staff were nice... they cheesy garlic bread was good with alot of garlic which i like."}
{"text":"Best pizza in all of Arizona! Their crust is to die for and their sauce is the best. Anything you get here will taste great! I wish we would have started coming here years ago."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! Close to work so we order from here at least once a month & they have NEVER disappointed us. Pizza, Cheese Garlic Bread, Greek Salad, Wings....anything on their menu is delicious!

On the side of a business plaza, so hard to notice...but worth it!!

Fresh ingredients & made to order"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this pizza. Tonight I took my friend there for her birthday..started with the house salad which was crisp and refreshing.. the ranch was ranch and didn't taste like seasoned mayo.awesome. I ordered the lil margherita and couldnt wait to taste that sweet goodness they have for a sauce and lo and behold the margherita is a white pizza???? You know what? It didnt matter it was magnificent without the signature sauce. This place is the best pizza place in Phoenix...hands down"}
{"text":"the first itme i had pizza from here i stole it from someone's fridge while i was drunka nd partying at their house - didnt know them btw. I thought it was from heaven. took me 2 years to enter the restaurant and when i did i was let down. too many good artisan pizza places in town do go back."}
{"text":"We tried them when they first opened in Ahwatukee. Did carryout. Ordered one of each style crust to see which we liked best. The answer was NONE. Bland crust and overly sweet sauce just did not appeal to any of our family members.

First time we ever threw leftover pizza in the garbage, rather than bag it for the next day... (I mean, who doesn't like cold pizza for breakfast?)"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Arizona! Great Service, great Garlic Bread, and always consistent. Gloria is my waitress every time I'm there. She's the best"}
{"text":"The service was great!  However the atmosphere lacked, mainly because there were no TVs or music playing.  The pizza was ok.  The sauce was way too sweet for my taste.  I couldn't taste the 5 toppings on my pizza it was so over powering.  The crust was thick and delicious.  Overall I had a decent experience, but I probably won't come again"}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza is outstanding!! I have a gluten sensitivity and my husband I are from out of town and wanted to share pizza somewhere. He found this place on Yelp and the ratings were right!! We learned there was a 25 minute wait and we didn't have that kind of time, so we placed an order to go. It took 25 minutes, but it was better than waiting for 25 then waiting another 25 for the meal. We ate in our car and with the first bite, we were in love. I forget he exact name, but we ordered the \"new favorite\" pizza with pepperoni, basil and feta cheese. It was the perfect size to share, and our mouths are happy right now!!"}
{"text":"We love love love this pizza!  I'm not usually a fan of thin crust pizza, but the sauce they use makes this pie absolutely delicious!  The sauce is quite sweet and makes for a taste that I've never had with any other pie.  They have jars available to purchase of their popular sauces, so I think I'll come back and stock up!  There is a handy take-out and pick up window as you enter."}
{"text":"I have been to 3 locations and they are all fantastic! Mama's signature pizza with spinach is out of this world! Such a great place. The one on glendale was byob at one time which was nice as well."}
{"text":"We had the spaghetti calzone and it was delicious! The antipasto salad was just ok, probably wouldn't get it again. The restaurant is pretty small but it fit our group of 11 just fine. Our waitress was great and didn't complain at all for having to split our check 10 ways!"}
{"text":"Their roasted fennel and Italian sausage pizza is to die for! Also the spinach one is pretty good. Best pizza in Tempe, I refuse to spend my money anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but I must say after trying this place I will never return. We ordered the pan pizza to go and it was so dry and over cooked we asked for a replacement pizza. After returning to exchange our pizza, the lady complains that 5 slices have been bitten into.  There was 4 of us eating, and we all agreed the pizza was awful, so we stopped eating our slices half way through.  The lady at the counter was so incredibly rude, and when I informed her we would not be returning she responded \"good.\" The pizza we were given next was average at best.  The crust was dry and hard, and the cheese and sause was average.  Very dissappointing for a place this is above average in price. Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is so good. The place seem to be always busy but the wait is worth it when you taste there food... I really recommend to the people who come here to try there spaghetti and meatballs calzone!! This calzone is to die for!! So good, full of flavors and melts in ur mouth..."}
{"text":"Awesome breadsticks and great pizza. The restaurant was a little small and hard to find at first but we were glad we did. The staff was excellent and I will for sure eat here again."}
{"text":"I really thought that I could ban Spinato's from my dining options since the other location on 7th St was not making the cut in customer service.  However, I was in the neighborhood and remembered that there was a Spinato's around here.  I started getting relapses. I needed that GF Combo Pizza with Jalapenos!  I hoped and prayed that the service here will be better than the last 80 horrible times at the one on 7th st.  

We walked in a fairly empty restaurant since it was past lunch time, before dinner time. Our waitress was phenomenal - attentive, friendly, and funny!  The pizza is still good!  I almost feel ashamed that I went back to Spinato's. I was planning to not even write a review because I was that ashamed - but look, I'm a yelper and not just any yelper, I'm an elite yelper so it's my duty!

This location does it right - food and customer service!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing, garlic bread is amazing. Clean restaurant with great service. Don't be fooled because you're in an industrial area.  This place is great."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the Valley. Cannot believe we have lived here 15 years without knowing about this wonderful gem. Great service and friendly staff. We will be back and tell others!"}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 5 stars not because it's a 5 star restaurant, but because their pizza and service are both amazing.  This thin crust Chicago style pizza is almost identical to the Aurelios pizza I grew up on in the south suburbs of Chicago.  It's pizza perfection.  The brownie dessert is to die for.  We didn't try to calzone but saw lots of other customers who ordered them."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch, it was hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Sooo much flavor. Also received great service. Doesnt look like much from the outside but don't let that fool you. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza and incredible service! Tried it for the first time Saturday night, and we'll definitely be going back. I talked to Bryce over the phone and in person, and he was super nice and professional. He was wearing an arm cast and was still upbeat and engaging, even with a healing bone. Thanks for everything, Bryce, and we'll be seeing you all again soon!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is impressive. Chicago style thin pizza (no deep dish) that is very, very good. Crispy and chewy crust, great sausage, sliced into squares. Best pizza I've had in awhile.

As a fan of Chicago pizza (my in-laws are from the Windy City) I always stick with limited toppings, one of which must be sausage. This time out, we did sausage and spinach, and it was awesome. The spinach is \"mama's recipe,\" where there's a secret ingredient. (The secret ingredient is garlic. Lots of garlic - and that's a good thing.)

This place is tucked away into an industrial park, so it can be hard to find. It's also rather small, and can get quite crowded. Expect a wait during busy periods. It's also BYOB."}
{"text":"Always amazing. Get the pesto sauce on top of
Anything you order, and you won't regret it :)
I also heard this location has the oldest pizza oven of them all, which makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I have never dined in here, so I can only speak about the food really.  I have ordered carry out and delivery many times from this place and have never had a bad experience.  Everything is always really fresh.  When I have done carryout the employees were always nice and attentive.  The delivery staff is always good as well.  Delivery has taken up to an hour at times on lunch, so just be prepared.  The food is still good, hot, and fresh when it arrives and is worth the wait.  Sign up for their email coupons and you will have a pleasant surprise every year the week of your birthday.  Bottom line, if I were to move from Phoenix and come back for a visit, my first food destination would be Spinato's for the Italian Beef Calzone."}
{"text":"Good food, freakin' BEAUTIFUL  building, my mother & I sat in the bar, and after I said something to an EXTREMELY loud waitress at the table behind us (geez servers, inside voices, please!), everything was great. Good, attentive service by a fella, really good food, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't even know how to begin... Chicago style pizza here AMAZING!! Hands down the best Chicago style pizza in the valley!! Im willing to say the best pizza west of illinois seriously!! Tastey and hearty subs but if ur a spinatos virgin u best b ordering the chicago because it will leaving u wanting more!!"}
{"text":"Here I was, so convinced I was going to be the first to Yelp about this place. It was going to be like the time I started listening to the Postal Service before anyone else I knew and then they got huge I was like \"Yeah I used to like them but I got kinda burned out since I've been listening to them for so long. No big deal.\" 

Point is, it's only a matter of time before more people discover this place, its totally unimpressive strip-mallified facade, but go in anyway because of a recommendation, and are BLOWN AWAY by the tasty red sauce. For selfish reasons, I hope it takes a while for that to happen so I don't have to wait to get a table. 

And the BYOB thing is no myth. Apparently they're waiting on a liquor license (which can take a while) and until then, you can bring your own booze by the truckload and there's no corkage fee. 

It's a small, family-owned joint inside a strip of mostly manicure shops. Don't be put off, go and get something, anything, so long as it has red sauce, and you won't be disappointed. Scout's honor."}
{"text":"Love is not about finding yourself, it's about finding good pizza, and if you are willing to share said pizza with someone, that is definitely true love.

I have found my one true love in Spinato's. Well, The Super Six is a favorite of mine, but I cannot deny my love for the Trio of Meatballs either. While I planned on only having a slice, I found myself sharing almost an entire pizza and one and a half meatballs with my husband in one sitting. Oops."}
{"text":"It isn't often I venture to Tempe, and if so, its typically for 4 Peaks. I was very excited to try something new! 

It was a Saturday night, so there was a bit of a wait, but no terrible. After seating, I was beyond disappointed to here they sold absolutely zero alcoholic beverages. Ya girl was NEEDING a beer. I begrudgingly went with iced tea and I'm still bummed about it. I had my 2 year old godson with me and ordered him chicken off the kids menu to later find out they were out of chicken. Bummer. 

I, myself, got the artichoke toast, a caesar salad, and pepperoni pizza. The toast and salad were effing fantastic while the pizza was extremely boring. The sauce was lacking. 

Seriously though, order the artichoke bread toast thing. Oh my lawd. 

The service and atmosphere were great! I don't know if I would drive all the way to Tempe to eat here, but I won't be against it if someone suggests it"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza in Arizona. I was originally refereed here by a guy who lived in NY for 10 years and said that when he moved back to AZ Spinato's was the only pizza that came close to the NY pizza he grew to love. I have to say, he was right on the money. Having been around the world trying pizza from Chicago, New York, and more, this pizza truly stands out to me. 

Everything I have ordered from here is probably one of the best versions of that dish I have ever tried. Granted that scope is limited because I cant help but order The Super Six pizza almost every time i come in there. This pizza is honestly live changing. Its flavorful, just a little sweet, and packs a big punch! I end up finishing the whole thing long after I'm stuffed. I'm a sucker for their delicious sausage and their garlic bread is amazing too! 

I would strongly recommend checking out this restaurant. There are a couple different locations in AZ. I heard that some of the other ones serve booze, but this one does not. That is honestly my only complaint that I cant buy a beer or wine. To be honest, that may be the only thing keeping me from eating there every meal. I am now a loyal fan for life!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza you will find in Phoenix. This place gives pizzeria Bianca and La Grande Orange an able challenger. The restaurant is small and intimate and fills up quickly during dinner and lunch. Luckily they have a take out option and you can go down the street to sleepy dog brewery to eat your pizza. 

All the pizza Ive had here has been great. I particularly like the Super Six, Nicole's Favorite and the spinach pizza. I would give it 5 if they had more seating and served alcohol."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Was staying at a local hotel and as we were checking in y'all had brought over some free samples to the hotel we caught a wif of it and knew at that moment...our dinner the next day would be from there!! Well turns out I couldn't wait that long so we ordered it for lunch! They delivered pool side at the moxy and all was right in the pizza world! Light airy thick crust just the right amount of tomato sauce and good gooey cheese!!! Well be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Terrific pizza for over 20 years from a really nice Chicago family. For those of you from the Windy City, think Home Run Inn (the original S. Side location).  The crust is they key...it's perfect -- thin and almost pastry-like. This crust and other fresh ingredients more than offset the slightly too sweet sauce and use of canned mushrooms.  One of the top 5 pizzas in the valley!"}
{"text":"one of the best thin crust pizza places in the phoenix area and the price is right too:
a) The Super Six has the right flavors and a lil sweet. 
b) The cheese with mushroom is always a favorite with me."}
{"text":"Warning! This review is a little different!

I had to post a review even though we didn't eat here at this location.

Long story short... Four of us were out celebrating a birthday, starting at a nearby Brewery and then planned to eat at Spinato's, as word is, it is delicious. 

With our buzz on, we sit down at Spinato's and realize this particular location does not have a Liquor license. 

This was a serious dilemma. We really wanted the pizza but we really weren't done celebrating yet!

Turns out, the Chandler location, DOES have a Liquor license...Hmmmm what to do??

Well, our lovely server made our decision for us and said go to the Chandler Spinato's, you guys need to keep having fun and celebrating. I just thought that was really cool of her because we were really mulling about it and she could just see the want in our eyes!

So, I think the customer service here is likely superb and based on that, I say GO!!! (Unless you want to drink, then go to Chandler)

See my review regarding the food on the Chandler Location. Because we did go and we drank and ate delicious pizza."}
{"text":"We LOVE spinatos. Their pizza is absolutely delicious and they have incredible service!!"}
{"text":"Super college town pizza. Thin, crispy crust good sauce and generous toppings. Three happy guys."}
{"text":"I've never been to the actual restaurant but I got delivery from here one night. I tried their specialty \"Mama Spinato's\" signature spinach pizza because I like trying whatever the \"house specialty\" is when I go to a new place. I was not disappointed. 

Another reviewer mentioned that the sauce is somewhat sweet and I'd agree with that. But it's not unpleasant, in fact I think I like it better than sauces I've had at other pizza places because of that.

The ingrediants definitely tasted fresh and were perfectly blended. As for the delivery service, it arrived hot and perfect so no complaints there. I've heard other reviewers say that this is the must-try pizza in the Valley and I can't say I disagree."}
{"text":"Loooove this place! Was visiting Tempe and of course I googled the best pizza in town, all the links that came up this place showed up. Came to eat here and the staff here is very friendly, our waitress was very nice and attentive and the food was Amazing!! I ordered a large pizza and ate about half before I knew it since it was so good. I highly recommend this place for pizza lovers."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! I so enjoy the thin crust with sausage and mushrooms. They make the sausage from scratch. So good! Sadly, they have changed the salad recipe. I have been getting a half spinach half mixed green salad for years. It is simple and a perfect way to start your meal. I was informed they no longer do this. They still have both types of lettuce but refuse to mix them. I am not sure if this is simply lazy service or if that is somehow a new rule as I was informed. Either way, not cool!"}
{"text":"I love Spinato's pizza.  I usually get a gluten free Get Meaty.  The gluten free crust is better than any I've had.  Their regular crust is, of course, delicious as we'll, but I have come to enjoy the gluten free crust even better than the regular.  My family loves to go to Spinato's."}
{"text":"We flew in to sky airport and were hungry.  Called hotel and the recommended this pizza spot.  We called in a pizza to go... and We ended up at the wrong spinatos and Bryce at the front desk told us he would take care of us..rushed a pizza out for us....and even called the other spinatos for us to cancel the other order.  Positive attitude and great service all around.  This place has a good vibe."}
{"text":"I go here on the weekends or after 5pm, and the Chandler location for lunch on the weekdays.  Every time the marinara blows me away; you can taste every ingredient in the sauce.  Every dish is the same, a true example of fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pizza in the valley. 

I only get cheese, and it's really unlike any other! My husband lives for the Spicy Italian. The cheesy garlic bread is a must have as well! 

Ask for Bryce's section, he's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Pizza! We have been going to Spinato's in Scottsdale for years. It was our Tuesday night date. Moved to Florida in 2014 and really missed great pizza. Went to Spinato's last night and had another Great Pizza. We have never been disappointed at Spinato's!"}
{"text":"Got a personal \"Nicola's New Favourite\" but with ham instead of pepperoni and friend got the L'Italiana. Her's had a lot more feta than mine which I was a bit disappointed on but otherwise, it was a really delicious pizza. It had plenty of really fresh, flavourful basil which was a nice change from usual. We also split the garlic bread with cheese which was awesome and the cookies (cake-y and good but baked that morning rather than \"fresh\" which was also kind of disappointing). They were also out of the apple serenata when we asked for it because I guess they make them in large batches for the week rather than to order... and by Sunday night they were just out. 
Salad, bread, cookies, and two pizzas for just over $32 before tip.
Service was pretty good though they seem disorganized about seating. It's not a huge place so that was odd. 
Overall - good food and decent service so I would probably recommend. Still, not enough to top Oregano's or even NYPD."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, but not great.  Garlic cheese bread was mediocre.  Apple pastry dessert was pretty damn good.  I give the experience 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best garlic bread Ive had in a long time.

Their pizza was really, really good. Our waiter was super nice and helpful.

Im looking forward to going back here and trying more of their menu."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free sandwiches and garlic bread!!  About to try the pizza!!!
Pizza was great!  I always find myself wanting a thicker Gluten Free pizza crust - but at least I can order a good pizza.  I had the \"meatsa\" pizza I believe it was called - it was great with the Roast beef on it.  Very happy camper - referred a friend the other day."}
{"text":"Spinato's is the best pizza in Tempe - no question. I've been stuffing my face with their yummy pizza for a few years now and I'm never disappointed.

Spinato's is a no frills, awesome food kinda place. You don't go here for the atmosphere, you go to fill your belly.

Here are a few of my fav menu items: 
Normally I don't really care for cooked spinach but their signature spinach pizza is fantastic. It's loaded with spinach and garlic so not the best choice if you're on a date. I recommend adding sausage to it as well to kick it up a level. So good. 
Speaking of spinach, last time I was there my friends and I got the spinach with extra sauce. I was hesitant because, like the cooked spinach, I don't like a ton of sauce on my pizza (apparently I'm picky). But just like the cooked spinach, Spinato's made extra pizza sauce extra awesome. They drizzle it on top of the cheese instead of just adding to the sauce underneath  to give the pizza an extra ounce of sweetness. 

And then there is the best thing on the menu - the spaghetti calzone. It's  a full spaghetti dinner wrapped into a bundle of dough. Get it with the meatballs and the ricotta cheese. I mean if you're gonna order a spaghetti calzone, you gotta go all in right? Right. 

The staff here is always really friendly. It's rare to get the same server more than once at places around here but at Spinato's their staff is consistent. And they remember us when we go in. It's nice to be acknowledged for being a regular. Kinda makes me think it might be time to visit them again..."}
{"text":"The place is good for hanging out with friends. Has a neat vintage look to it. We also loved the food, it was excellent."}
{"text":"I brought my friend here, because I wanted her to taste this great place my bud, Debra showed me last week.  We went to the one in Tempe, since we were at Tempe Marketplace.  This location is in an industrial park, no real signage...but look for their catering truck in the lot.  Very small loc, but food is just as good.  Our server, Brad, was quick and friendly.we tried the medium combo pizza, had their Happy Hour ( strawberry & Gorgonzola salad, their apple& walnut salad, 3 meatball & stuffed mushrooms w/cheese).  Everything was great tasting...will be back for that cracker thin crust pizza.  This our new go to place."}
{"text":"This pizza is addictive. I love the Pepperoni but the spinach one surprised me and I reordered it another day. They are fun to visit and everybody we have taken there returned in the same week. This is not similar to other pizza you may have tried. A little sweet is what some people tell me. Worth the visit and go hungry and get the salad. One salad will feed two and maybe three people."}
{"text":"Best pizza loved it ... I have been here 3 times and order the veggie pizza and garlic bread .. It was good"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best pizza joints I've been to in a while. The staff was super friendly and really patient with us. They really took the time to explain everything we asked and were very detailed in explaining what they're pizzas were like. The pizza itself was delicious and meaty, there was no lack of meat that's for sure.  I feel it had a perfect pizza environment.  I'd recommend this place for sure."}
{"text":"Freaking outstanding pizza!  It's a treat whenever I go. The atmosphere is very classic Italian.  My favorite pizza is the famous spinach pizza.  Even if you consider yourself a carnivore, I highly recommend trying this pizza out."}
{"text":"When my husband and I moved out here, the first place his co-workers said we had to eat was Spinato's.  His boss ordered it for lunch one day and my phone started blowing up with texts from my husband telling me he was bringing this home for dinner.  He said simply - best pizza I've ever had.  

I was skeptical.  Is it really that good?  Was he just really hungry?  NO!  From the minute he walked in the door - the pizza grabbed my attention.  From the smell to the look to the taste.  Hands down - best pizza I've ever had.  

They don't deliver to our place, but it's well worth the trip down the 51 to pick it up.  The staff is alway nice and will remember you after a few trips.  All around - great food, great service and local."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good place. Nice service. Their sauce was really good...nice sweet touch; not cloying just good hint of sweetness to make it unique."}
{"text":"My family has been coming here for almost thirty years now. It is hands-down the best pizza in Tempe, and possibly the entire East Valley. If you know that new wave of deep dish Chicago pizza is all a bunch of cheese pie crap, you'll be seeing me here for the best Chicago pizza in town."}
{"text":"Again, Yelp*, why no 1/2 stars.  I'm not giving five but this was better than four.

Terrific pizza, I ordered it without mentioning, \"don't cut it\"; you know they like to do the cross-cut here.  She told me it would be about 25 minutes.  Well, I called back after 14 minutes and she said she'd tell them not to cut the pizza, but  when I got there, it had already been cut.  I have to tell you, this young woman apologized at least 4 times and offered to re-cook the pie at least that many times.  It was my mistake, they were faster than expected, didn't want them to re-cook the pizza.

She should have apologized and offered to re-cook...and she did.  Pizza was great, of course and next time I'll remember to ask for no-cut.  In the meantime, this is a good spot.  Go there!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. You cannot go wrong with any of them. The sauce is what makes these pies extra special. It actually nice and sweet! That is what makes this place so delicious.

Be sure to go there on Tuesday for the Beer specials. They have Peroni & Stella on tap. Yum!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me with this place... :) I love it. The food is amazing and the service is friendly. Its clean and fast. LOVE the calzones."}
{"text":"The Best Pizza in Town!!!! Simply put. All of my friends and I love this place. The food is just really delicious. You can't go wrong with the big six pizza. They don't serve alcohol though and that is probably the only thing missing from this great restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved to Phoenix, and we were looking for a nice place for pizza. Luckily, Spinato's was just around the corner. The service was fantastic, with a wait time around seven minutes. Curious about their tea, our server allowed us to have a sample (in a rather large cup) of their green tea. Ultimately, we didn't order any tea, but our server provided consistent, positive service. My boyfriend and I ordered a large Da' Greek pizza for our meal. While the pizza combination was delicious, I did find a slight flaw. The only thing I didn't like was the amount of moisture soaked into the crust. I'm not sure if that's how the pizza is supposed to be, but it was almost impossible to eat without a fork. There was enough pizza to take home though, and the leftovers lasted us for a couple of days. Also, be sure to try the Cider. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Only one word comes to mind about this place \"OVERRATED\" i ordered the sausage with extra sauce, the extra sauce was spread around the top of the pizza...COLD which made the pizza disgusting already the sausage was nothing to write home about. good service i suppose and that's the only reason i'm not giving it 1 star, as far as Chicago Style goes i think Johnnie's pizza is light years ahead. Not worth it if your in that shopping center and you must eat just go to Codfathers."}
{"text":"THE best pizza I have ever had. Hands down, no contest. Had I not had to share with the rest of my family I would have devoured the entire large pizza to myself."}
{"text":"A little background.... 

My husband is from a sleepy community about an hour south of Chicago. My husband could/would eat pizza everyday of his life if I permitted. When we went back to visit his parents he actually took me on a pizza tour of the area all of which ended with his absolute favorite pizza, Aurelio's. His love for this pizza stems from childhood and I honestly do not think you could convince him that there is a greater pizza out there. I even once looked into shipping Aurelio's for a birthday present and quickly realized that that was insanely expensive. 

Fast forward to this summer when I discovered a review on Yelp that mentioned that there used to be an Aurelio's here in AZ that eventually became Spinato's. Well my husband insisted that we get in the car that moment and check it out. The sweet marinara is exactly what he was looking for and while not exactly the same this is the closest pizza in Arizona to his beloved favorite. The crust is thin and the sausage is hand crumbled (or appears to be). They are very generous on the cheese and toppings in general and leftovers the next day aren't too shabby. We have never had an issue with service or our order on the several occasions we have been One of my favorite things about Spinato's is the ice, seriously I have a passion for crushed ice and lots of it!"}
{"text":"This place comes up on every pizza list I could find. So we went there. Got a pizza. Long wait, the place was crowded and the take out even more busy. The pizzas are cooked on screen over a conveyor belt. I have had the same pizzas in Jersey, but the dough just isn't the same as a tossed pie and brick oven. The sauce was good, very cooked down and tasty but a bit salty. Too much corn flour on the bottom for me but my friend likes it that way so I will leave that for you.  It was good. I think the Italian food might need a tasting next visit."}
{"text":"We came a little before closing, everyone was friendly and attentive. This was our first time here, i was very impressed. we ordered gluten free garlic bread, and two pizzas. Everything  was delicious  and amazing!!"}
{"text":"So i went here after church with some friends. I can honestly say, yes Spinato's is good, BUT this one is not as good as the one on Bell. 

I really enjoy the pizza here. My one complaint is, the thick crust pizza is so generic tasting, it is a pizza hut reminiscent thick crust. which in my mind. Not a good thing. The thin crust is the way to go if you come to spinatos"}
{"text":"I think I have found my favorite pizza place. Woohoo, Yelpers. Spinato's is as good as it gets for me.

My date and I went here today (Thursday, 7/28) for a late lunch. This is the first pizza place that we have both loved. He is a lover of Chicago deep dish with a million toppings and I am much like Kenneth the Page from 30 Rock (my favorite pizza topping is plain). 

Location: Spinato's is indeed tucked in an industrial park on Smith Street between University and Rio Salado, closer to the latter. You might not even notice the restaurant upon first glance. I didn't. (Look for the misters and the \"open\" sign.) It's not really a date-date place, so don't take a first date here. 

Service: Greeted by a friendly, college-freshman-aged host and asked if we wanted the front or the back. I personally like being able to choose where I sit in a restaurant. It helps me avoid being suck by a loud table/upset babies/restrooms/etc.
Our server Hannah was a sweet as could be. She didn't hover over our table and she came at always the right times to take our orders and see if we needed anything. 

Drinks: As a fellow Yelper mentioned, Spinato's serves crushed ice, akin to the wonderful Sonic ice. I'm a sucker for crushed ice and would give Spinato's five stars for this reason alone. The drinks are huge. I didn't even finish my delicious Dr Pepper. Oh yeah, they serve Dr Pepper!!!!11!!!!!!11!!one!!!!!! and some Pepsi products, I think. 

Food: We ordered a small house special -- Mamma Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Spinach. The pizza was the perfect size for the two of us to split.
The spinach was excellent and there was a ton of delicious fresh garlic on top of the pie. After reading other reviews that complained about a \"sweet sauce,\" I have to say that maybe the wonderful garlic counteracted the sweetness. I didn't notice the sauce being too sweet. 

Dessert: We ordered the brownie bella piccola ($3.49), which was a great size to split. The brownies were not very dense, but had a great fudge-chocolaty flavor and the vanilla bean gelato was a nice addition to the chocolate overload. 

Overall, Spinato's is a great pizza place and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"The best pizza and value in the city! Our favorite place.  The staff is great and friendly and one of reasons we feel great about this place.  The food is great and my wife is a pizza perfectionist!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"This tiny, hidden pizzeria is an absolute gem! While the space is small, the pizza and service are phenomenal. Once you've had their signature spinach and tomato pizza, the cravings will hit you out of nowhere and you'll have to return. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My fianc√© loves this place.  He really likes the sweet sauce and it seems like all the people who love this place rave about it.  The quality of the food is excellent and the pizza was delicious, but it is just my personal preference that I don't like super sweet pizza sauce.  If they had an option for a less sweet sauce this place would probably be my favorite, hands down, like it is my fiance's.  It's just my personal preference, but the quality is there folks!  Also, we got our order to go and everyone was super friendly and attentive and we got complimentary drinks while we waited.  Definitely worth checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Found this on yelp while on my way to see a movie at Tempe Marketplace. My kids and I were going to head to MOD and grab something, but decided to try something new. It was a mistake. We had a Greek salad and a medium pizza. The salad dressing was so overwhelming that you didn't even notice any of the flavor present from the feta and other vegetables in the salad. The pizza was reminiscent of what my elementary school served. Overly sweet sauce and a very squishy, spongy, floppy pizza dough. We had a meatball, pepperoni and red onion pizza that featured crumpled meatball and nary a pepperoni. I can tell you the flavors we unidentifiable because the sauce was so sweet. A medium pizza and a happy hour Greek salad ran $27. Save your money and go to MOD or one of the other numerous choices for pizza in the area."}
{"text":"HOLY SMOKES! I now have FOUR favorite Phoenix pizza places! 

With pizza I'm all about the sauce, and this is the shizz! Yeah it's sweet, like really sweet but I freakin' LOVE it! It's soooooooooo good that I don't even want a topping,  just cheese and that fabulous sauce! This maybe my new favorite pizza but it's such a tough call. 

For the record ... the best in Phoenix (for me) ... in no particular order.

Pizza A Metro (pepperoni) 
Spinato's (cheese) 
Cibo (Diavola which is the best topping I've ever had on a pizza)
Pane Bianco

All three just rock my world, man do I LOVE Spinato's!"}
{"text":"We were a group of seven, with 3 kids. Everyone was happy with their order. The pizza is thin-crust and light on the sauce. I'm sure they'd add some extra if you ask. The location is kinda remote; I understand it is the home location where they make their pizzas for all locations, making sure they are the same style and taste at all locations. This location is rather small with a casual vibe. That made it perfect for us since we have a child who can get too much stimulation and stress out. They also have gluten free choices, which fit our family well. I had the Greek salad and it was good also. The only drawback was that they don't have the kids' menu, but that was easily solved with sharing. There is also no alcohol served at this location."}
{"text":"Planned a get together for 3 friends birthdays and one friend recommended this place!!  Our party got bigger than expected and none of us have been here so didn't realize it would be small according to Fred the manager when I called to RSVP. Much to my surprise it was very comfortable even for being small!  Fred was amazing to get my party of 18 in and seated quickly. Our server was extremely accommodating.  I loved the fact you could order personal portion sizes!  It was the perfect portion. My Greek salad was fantastic. The only thing not wonderful was the sauce was a tad on the sweet side for me. I like for of a tangy sauce but I will go back and try the marinara next time instead!  We will be back!!!!  Thank you Fred and staff!!!!"}
{"text":"We are new in town and have tried several restaurants. Most are average. Spinato's is exceptional! The food and service was great. Delicious marinara, cheesy bread, and salad. We'll return for sure!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!
\"...so good, you'll jump up and slap the person sitting next to you...\"

This location has moved to the corner of Missouri & 7th St; talk about making a good thing better."}
{"text":"This has become my new favorite pizza place.  We ordered take out the first week that we arrived in town and just went again for my son's birthday and everything turned out great.  Also, we showed up without a reservation on a Saturday for supper and we seated within 30 minutes.  Easily the best pizza in the county, maybe even the state!"}
{"text":"After reading all the glowing reviews of Spinato's Pizza in Tempe, my wife and I wanted to give it a try while we were visiting in the area. Unfortunately, our experience did not live up to others' experiences. 

We ordered a medium combination pizza and disaster lurked before we got a bite in our mouths. The pizza was delivered on a rack that was resting precariously on a pizza tin. I could see right away that the ingredients had begun to ooze down onto the pizza tin. With a spatula we tried to remove a piece or two of the pizza for consumption. Bad move! The rack slipped off the pizza plate and we grabbed it just in time to keep it from hitting the floor. As you might imagine, we had to adjust our serving mode and finally got some pizza to our plates.

Let me cut right to the heart of the matter: this $25 pizza was just a notch better than a grocery store frozen pizza. The thin crust was almost transparent, and the sauce had virtually no taste. The cheese, I believe, was mozzarella which led to the pizza's general blandness. The Italian sausage and peppers, however, were fine. Unfortunately, the overall gustatory experience left much to be desired...definitely not an \"A Class\" pizza in any sense of the word.

Our server, Bryce, was full of food suggestions and he proved to an affable person. I just wish he did not include the word \"guys\" in every full or truncated sentence. I left him a generous tip and perhaps he'll invest in a thesaurus."}
{"text":"Came into town for business. I wanted to try this place after reading other reviews. I am glad I tried this place out and was not disappointed. I ordered a thin crust small pepperoni pizza. The crust was crunchy and delicious. The cheese and pepperoni was very good. I especially love the zesty taste of the tomato sauce. Sauce was very sweet and I really liked it. The place is hidden in a small business park so use GPS when trying to find this place. The restaurant is small but very cozy. Staff was very nice and always checked on me and other customers. I wish they would have had TVs to keep me occupied while waiting for the pizza to come out. All in all, I highly recommend this place for any visitors that come in town as well as locals. I know next time I am town, I will come back again!"}
{"text":"Since moving more centralized, this has become my wife and I's favorite pizza for dine in and to go, as well as the Bell location.  They offer gluten free crust, willing to do no cheese and several sizes of pizza, so your party can get one or two pizza's for all or everyone can get their own preference.  I generally get the small size for myself, which leaves my with 30-40% of the pie for leftovers for breakfast or lunch.  Not bad to get 2 meals for $8-12. The Lil' size is usually enough for 1, if you will not be near a fridge in the near future.  My faves are the Spicy Italian and Canadian.  The services is always, friendly and the staff makes you feel at home!"}
{"text":"Apparently, as predicted, my review of Spinato's ruffled some feathers, in particular Yelper Tony M.'s feathers.  He updated his review to specifically include me in it.

I'm honored however to move another Yelper enough to send me several messages (enough to block him) and to update their actual review to include me!  Oh, I still stand by my original review."}
{"text":"What a great little find thanks to Yelp!  There were 3 of us and we had a family sized dinner salad for a little over $10 with an excellent pomegranate dressing. Then we had a large pizza - The Spicy Italian, which was awesome!  The meat was very good and the crust was excellent on the thin crust.  We will definitely be back!  Out waitress was super nice too."}
{"text":"Ugh, some of the best pizza in town.  Just moved to the 'Slope in 2011 and this place has added a couple of pounds to me for sure.  Chicago style thin crust, square cut deliciousness.

Ever miss that smell that pizzerias used to have?  The kind that made you so happy and hinted that there would be a Pacman machine in a table top?  That's what this place makes me feel like.

I LOVE the Spicy Italian specialty pizza, and even though it sounds weird, you just have to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs Calzone.  Ask for it with Ricotta, you'll thank me!"}
{"text":"This is a great thin crust pizza with a crispy/crunchy cracker crust. The toppings were good but not off the charts. The absolute best thing going (besides the crust) is the ridiculously tasty red sauce. Get the meatball appetizer if you need to try for yourself, and then order a pizza with it. It's amazing! Minus one star for uneven service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Spinato's is in my opinion the best pizza in the entire nation. Forget Pizzeria Bianco, Spinato's is where it's at!!"}
{"text":"Love everything I've tried here.  A little bummed that the Tempe location doesn't do pasta."}
{"text":"From start to finish:

Answering the phone was Elena, who was friendly and attentive.  I ordered two pizzas and she told me delivery would take 45-60 minutes ( and I am 4 miles away).

It took 35 min.

I ordered the thin crust Signature Spinach, and Super Six (meat & vegetable), and they are a tasty balance of flavors, and it smells great.

I hope you are within range of them for delivery because you will never order from a major chain again."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, I really wish I had that version on my visit. I was underwhelmed, service took an hour to get our food, when asking for 3 or 4 Ranches for the table, we were asked \"Can I just bring you one?\", check took another 30 minutes. 

Maybe I got an off-day, maybe it was her first day, maybe there was more going on I was unaware of on the back end, but my experience definitely doesn't match up with the other reviews on here, so maybe I'll have to give it another shot further down the road."}
{"text":"I have been searching far and wide for a decent pizza/salad place I could get to on my lunch break for, oh, two years now. Fuck decent, this shit is delicious!!

Thanks to the lovely Sunny B.'s review on the Spinato's in Central Phoenix, I decided to do a little digging and see if they had one anywhere near Tempe. And that is when I found this total hole-in-the-wall little shack of heaven a block away from Tempe Marketplace.

I know we've all been taught not to judge a book my its cover, so seriously, do not let the meager building scare you away as there is a serious gem hidden inside.

Chicago style thin crust pizza, oven baked to a perfect crisp. Heavy on the tomato sauce just like I like it, and a heaping house salad served almost immediately after ordering it. And they also have a bunch of gluten-free options for you unlucky Celiac sufferers out there.

I am in love. I will certainly be back. After they get their liquor license, I might never leave."}
{"text":"Honestly my only complaint is that it is always freezing cold inside. The food is amazing. My favorite is the Nicole's New. It is delicious and never disappoints. Service is always on point."}
{"text":"It's a home alone Sunday night, and I'm in the mood for something better than what's left in my fridge while I watch football and clean out the DVR. I read a lot of good things about Spinato's, so I figured why not. 

I checked out the menu online. While I was happy to see they have online ordering, I was disappointed to discover that at 2.33 miles away, I could only pick up my order. I decided to go ahead and make a pick up order anyway. I will say that Spinato's web site is great to order from. It offers up several options about what you can add to the pizza and how you want them to bake it. I went ahead and went with a lil' \"signature\" fresh spinach, and an order of garlic bread. 

The garlic bread was a big disappointment. It tasted no different than something you'd pick up and toast at any grocery store. 
The pizza was pretty good, but not worth driving out to pick up. I'm also not a big fan of the sweet sauce. 

I'd be willing to give Spinato's another try if I were going to eat out. But if I'm going for take out, there's a few better options in the South Scottdales/North Tempe area."}
{"text":"This has got to be the most tastiest best pizza in town! They really pile the stuff on top and we just love the taste of their sweet sauce! We always order the Vegetarian and other places that we have tried their vegetarian pies they have all been very bland tasting with no flavor but not the case with Spinato's pies! We highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I shared a large Signature Spinach pizza with 3 friends, we were pretty satisfied with the pizza. We tend to be pretty picky and fussy about our pizza becuase were all from NYC and NJ. the crust was a little doughy i prefer it to be more crispy. The flavors from the spinach and garlic really stand out and make for a very tasty pizza. I will definitely be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"The food is always great here
Authentic Chicago style thin crust pizza with a great tomato sauce and awesome crust
I bought some chocolate cookies which are usually very good, but the batch that I bought seemed to be a little light on the chocolate chips inside the cookies. 
All in all I highly recommend it
Also I wish they would add delivery!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had tried this place earlier! It has quickly become my go-to place for pizza in the Valley. I really like Oregano's, but they are better known for their specialty pizzas and when I crave sausage pizza they aren't my number one choice. I've never actually eaten in-shop as I always pick it up and take it home, but they are prompt and I've never had to wait for it to finish. There is seriously something addicting in their sweet sauce, because you definitely start to crave it after a while. I wasn't quite sure the first time I had it, but I've quickly come to love the taste.

I tend to go between the Mama's Signature, the Combo, and the Sausage and Peppo, but I've never had a bad pizza. Way better than the chains! I've found it even reheats better than most."}
{"text":"This is a five star place. 

Can't go wrong with anything but the thin crust pizza is fantastic.  

Severs are all great. They use to have diet Dr Pepper but no more.  Perhaps a half star deduction?

I really like the Greek salad."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to drop in and try Spinato's Pizza. I had been hearing good things for many years and for whatever reason, just didn't get into any of the Metro Phoenix locations. Well, I'm so glad I finally did and can say it's one of my favorites. We ordered a large Caesar Salad and an 18\" thin crust pie with the regular tomato sauce. I tried to talk our party into pesto, but was outnumbered. I have to say, the tomato sauce is very sweet. I don't think I've tasted a sauce quite like it on a pizza. The dough and ingredients are perfect together and its evident that once you try this pizza, you'll more than likely be hooked. Next time, I'm looking forward to trying the pie with pesto sauce as well and maybe even comparing the two side by side."}
{"text":"Total Tempe staple. Nicole's New Favorite is my all-time favorite pizza (ask my boyfriend - that's saying a lot!). I keep an almost entirely pescatarian diet, but I'll stray for this dish. The garlic bread is also yummy & the staff is laid back & friendly. Service is usually very quick, but they have limited seating & there can be a wait. They don't serve booze at this location, but I believe the one in Ahwatukee does."}
{"text":"I love their pizza.  We had a get together at work so we had it delivered but if you can eat it there and fresh...OMG.

We ordered a Veggie, Get Meaty, Pepperoni, and Chicken Pesto pizzas.  We also ordered a couple salads too.  I didn't touch any of those but I was told they were good.

As far as the pizza, one of the best.  Crust was thin and toppings a plenty.  I first had two squares of the Get Meaty cause it looked good.  I wouldn't say best ever but at least top 5.  

I took a piece of the Chicken Presto Pesto and my mind was blown.  I have tasted this type of pizza from other places but they wouldn't be able to hold up against the taste of this one.  Again the crust was thin and crispy.  There was a lot of chicken but not over loaded.  The artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes worked with swirl of basil pesto sauce that was spread across the pie.  I ended up eating 4 more squares.

Like I said, the crust would probably better if we ate it there but the quality of the pizza sauce and toppings didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have only been to this location once, but I have been to the Bell/16th St. location numerous times.  Their canolies are amazing too.  They get extremely busy on weekend nights, so plan ahead.  I think they are closed on Sundays or Mondays too."}
{"text":"In a word \"delicious.\". Probably the best pizza I've had..ever..anywhere. The wait was a bit long but the food and service were great."}
{"text":"oh the pizza the sauce is sweet but i love it even can eat it cold the calzones are great too its a little pricey for pizza so its a special occasion but so good"}
{"text":"I L-O-V-E Spinato's, and have for many years.  Their sauce is so packed with flavor, but not overwhelming.  It's just right, and tastes very fresh.  Service is always awesome, and their delivery is always great.  

Recently, I found that I'm allergic to gluten, so I tried Spinato's gluten free pizza.  WOW!  I would order this bad boy over the original.  I don't know what that scrumdillicious gluten free dough is made from, but I now crave it.  I just wish it came in a bigger size than the 10\" pizza.  

One other thing that impressed me about Spinato's recently.  When ordering for delivery, I advised the kind lady on the phone that I was gluten free... she took the initiative to look at my previous orders and let me know that I should probably discontinue ordering meatball on the pizza, as they have gluten in them as well. Yay for customer service!!  

If you haven't tried Spinato's, I highly recommend them, for many reasons.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"No better pizza in the world than Mama's Spinach, with several shakes of Parm!!  Pizza, in general, wasn't even in my top 3 favorite foods until I sunk my teeth into this.  You'll have a stinky mouth all night because of the garlic, but it's worth it.  As far as the Tempe location goes, who cares that the drywall isn't finished, you'll never have a nicer group of people serving you!  Shout out to the originator, Joe in Chicago Heights, IL!"}
{"text":"This location is pretty small but it does have a certain charm to it. The place is not much to look at from the outside, and it is located in an industrial area south of Rio Salado near Tempe Marketplace. However, when we dined there with a large group the service was great and the food was everything I have come to expect from Spinatos. Be aware that this location does not serve alcohol, though. Apparently they used to have a license for BYOB but they no longer do that, either."}
{"text":"Slices or Spinato's? When you're near Tempe Marketplace and don't want to miss the movie you are about to watch you should check this place out. Slices is more of a \"New York\" style pizza where as Spinato's is more of a homemade style pizza, and I don't say that with any disrespect. In fact, if I had to suggest one of the two places I would most definitely suggest Spinato's. I'll try outline my reasoning behind this choice.

Slices just has their \"NY\" style pizza, and to be quite honest they don't even do it that well. There are tons of places in Phoenix that do \"NY\" style pizza, and a notable place is Venezia's on Southern and Mill, not too far from Tempe Marketplace. Spinato's does have an \"NY\" style pizza and a Sicilian pizza, and the latter is actually pretty good.

On a Friday night, this place gets somewhat packed for dine-in, but you can order \"eat-in\". So basically, you order you food, wait to be seated, and then shortly after being seated you can get your food. This worked out pretty well. The service is also good, and the staff are pretty friendly. Bathroom was small, one bathroom for the whole place, but it was clean and well kept. 

The pizza was very interesting, we got a Sicilian \"Traditional Vegetarian\" pizza. Essentially, if you could compare it to another pizza it'd be DiGiorno. Seriously though, the pizza reminded me a lot of DiGiorno's frozen pizza. This place has a unique homemade feeling to it, and even the pizza. I'm not saying its bad, its just unique. The crust is actually delicious, and I usually don't care too much about the taste of the crust, but this one actually tasted pretty good. The downside though is the way they served it, nothing to pick up slices with, and it was super easy for toppings to slide through the grill when it was warm. It became somewhat of a pain to handle the first few slices. 

This place has serious selection issues. Let's see, pork, pork, more pork, and a little bit more pork, oh and a little bit of vegetarian stuff. Ok, so where does that leave kosher meat eaters? Not at this place. If you eat kosher meat, and enjoy it on your pizza, this is not the place to come. There is literally no chicken or beef available here in terms of toppings.

This place is pretty good and moderately priced. My significant other and I shared a 14\" sicilian, and got waters which totaled to something like $15. Certainly not a terrible price, but for the price I think we could do a little better. I suppose if we wanna catch a movie after dinner we would visit this place, but it is certainly isn't on the top of our pizza visiting list. Its good pizza, it filled me up, it was tasty, but pizza is a competitive market."}
{"text":"The spinach signature pizza is heavenly.  It had the perfect mix of ingredients, from the tangy-sweet tomato sauce, the fresh spinach and tomatoes, the nicely browned cheese, with a bite from the freshly chopped garlic.  Service was excellent, and drinks were refilled promptly.  We opted to share a cannoli for dessert, which had a light, sweet filling with a crunchy outer layer.  I dig the atmosphere, and enjoyed listening to the classic rock in the restaurant.  Definitely will dine here again!"}
{"text":"I went to spinato's after a good friend said it was her favorite pizza place and I trust her opinion. It did not disappoint and I will be returning in the future many times"}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago our pizza standards are pretty high. This location could have been a successful joint in Chicago. Great pizza, excellent service!  It was well worth the wait. The only lackluster element is the atmosphere. It's all basic tables and chairs and quite sparse. The food is what you are going for though. Even the house salad was excellent. The pizza sports a sweet tomato sauce which was really good on the 'Chicago' with sausage, onion and peppers. If I'm back in this area I'll definitely return.  Actually wish they had a location in Chicago. Thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"We love spinatos. It's a bit off the beaten path & probably not well-known because of that! I like it all the more for that reason. Every meal we've had there  has been great. Last night our sandwich & pizza was slightly over-cooked & was more likes cracker than crust or bread. I was disappointed because we brought another couple for their first time.
It's small & sometimes has a bit of a wait, but we've never waited long. You can't go wrong with their pizza (unless it's cooked to a crisp)."}
{"text":"Everyone says this place is so great and I would say that's true. I took a friend of mine there and she ordered a spaghetti stuffed calzone and I ordered a personal pizza, I believe it was called Nicoles. My friend raved about how hers was the best meal she has had in a long time. The pizza had good flavor and the crust was just right.! We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Had seven pizzas from Spinatos today for a group of 16. This was my first time here on the recommendation of a person in the group. He said the sauce was amazing and i have to agree. The pizza sauce is awesome and the crust was perfect. 5 of 5 stars for this place on a take out order. Thx"}
{"text":"The food is Yummy! The people are pleasant.  Little expensive, worth it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is great. You should order Nicky's favorite. The 12st and Glendale locate has 1/2 price pitchers on Thursdays. Don't miss out on great pizza and great service. 

It is all about the food not location.  So this place gets 5 stars.   

Only downsize is the place is small and gets full up quickly. So go early to get a table. They just need to build a bigger place for the great pizza."}
{"text":"Pineapple and pepperoni with extra sauce. I know it sounds weird, but it's a great combination at Spinato's. The sauce is boss, and I can't get over how perfectly chewy and crisp the crust is.

While at Spinato's, I was treated to a display of the restaurant's outstanding service. A table of business diners were upset because one had asked for cheese after receiving a calzone and didn't realize that meant making a whole new calzone. Instead of appreciating the lengths Spinato's will go to provide a fresh, delicious meal, she shrieked, \"Can't you just throw some cheese on top?\" And her pal was mad because he asked for sweet peppers and then ate his sandwich before the peppers arrived. 

To the servers' credit, they comped a few items, boxed what couldn't be waited for and apologized profusely. I wouldn't have handled it so well.

So, for me, Spinato's doesn't compare with Pino's, but we're talking a different style of pizza. I certainly will be back when in Arizona."}
{"text":"Tried ordering take out from Grimaldi's and Oregano's, but they were all 1+ hour wait!! 

Spinato's gave us a reasonable 35 minute wait time, and it was delicious and affordable! I didn't try the baked spaghetti calzone, but it was a favorite among my group. The pizza was cut into squares, which I don't mind, but I was not expecting that either. This place is really small, so I'm glad we ordered take-out!"}
{"text":"I trully cant say anything bad just i wish this place were bigger in tempe! It does get pretty packed but so worth it. We come here for lunch very often because of the service which has been always great even though they are packed in but thats what makes it nostalgic. It reminds me of back east. I love it, major kudo's Spinato's!"}
{"text":"Went back about two weeks ago to send off a friend. This place is orgasmic. We shared the homemade sausage pizza and a small spaghetti calzone. On my dying bed I would ask for a spaghetti calzone with meatballs and ricotta."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. Their pizza is in my top 3 as far as the selection in Arizona, and the ONLY downside is that the Tempe location (to my knowledge) still doesn't have any of the pasta dishes that some of the other locations have. The crust is always perfect, the sauce is sweet but with just the right amount of spice to it, and the cheese and toppings are flawless. On top of having some of the best pizza in town, their customer service is top-notch. If you haven't tried Spinato's yet, put it on your to-do list!"}
{"text":"Our family always enjoys a night a spinatos. We always request Lorenzo as our server."}
{"text":"Such a shame that the restaurant closes at 8 on Sundays cause I honestly felt really bad about getting there at 6 and felt like I had to rush through my dinner so I couldn't quite enjoy it as much as I wanted to, but regardless, their pizza is phenomenal.

The salads are okay.  I wasn't a fan, but it was an obligatory salad in preparation of feeling guilty for the next week or so cause of all the Thanksgiving feasting, so I ate it anyway.  We got the signature spinach pizza along with the meaty pizza, both in mediums, and it fed the 5 of us quite well (and trust me, we know how to feast).  The slices are cut in little squares which make it real easy to lose track of how many slices you've had.  That, and the fact that their pizzas have this delicious sweet sauce, giving their pizzas a unique taste you can only get at Spinato's.  And they are good.  So good that my boyfriend's brother came out from California last year to visit us, fell in love with Spinato's, and this year, made it a point to stop by Spinato's again this trip.  Definitely stop by if you haven't tried them already!"}
{"text":"We have been to Spinato's quite a few times and have liked it everytime. My daughter has Celiac disease, so she hasto have gluten free pizza,and feels that Spinato's has the best gluten free pizza. I have had pizza also there that wasn't gluten free and it was delicious each time. Friendly and fast service makes it an enjoyable place to eat.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best delivery I have had in years. Feeling to lazy to cook I ordered Spinato's last night. I got the super six pizza, thin crust, well done with extra sauce, a small dinner salad and a side order of meatballs. 

The pizza was Chicago style and phenomenal! (See pictures) The pizza ingredients were really fresh and the sauce (OH THE SAUCE) tangy and sweet. The meatballs were also delicious and had a very different marinara sauce than what was on the pizza. Spinato's beats any delivery in my area (Sorry Pat's) and has made the rotation in to my favorite Chicago style pizza. I can't wait to actually try the restaurant, I heard they have great specials and BYOB."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. The sauce was pretty sweet. The wait was 30-35 minutes but it was totally fine, we just sat outside and waited. The guy who was our server seemed a bit...off but he was prompt with service. Not sure if I'll go back."}
{"text":"Eh. Placed an order for delivery online for the first time tonight.  The confirmation said it would be 75 minutes, which wasn't unreasonable because the NBA Finals were on TV. It actually took 90 minutes and the pizza was barely warm, and definitely not hot. I had to put it in the oven. Ordered the Combo pizza. The Italian sausage was good, the peppers were ok, but the mushrooms were canned. Gross. The sauce was also way too sweet. Definitely not my favorite pizza and I won't be ordering from there again, especially when a large pizza is $20. If you charge that much for a pizza it better show up hot and it better be good."}
{"text":"I was born near Chicago, moved away by three and have never been back.  So as an adult I have missed out on all the great cusine known from this midwest mecca of a city.  This place makes me feel like I'm taking a journey away from the valley and right into a neighborhood restaurant in Chicago.  I love the pizza here as well as the down to earth relaxing atmosphere.  Servers have always been great to me.  I don't know how anyone could say anything bad about this place.  Until I take a vacation to the windy city, I'll have to come here to get my fill."}
{"text":"Best pizza I can get this side of the Mississippi. As a native New Jerseyian I've had more than a tough time finding a good pizza out here. Would definitely recommend to anyone trying to actually get a good piece of pizza. My favorites are the spinach signature and plain pizza."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of Chicago-style pizzas.  However, Spinato's was definitely different from any that I've tried, and the crust is quite tasty, the cheese high quality, and the sauce pretty good too -- if a bit unique.  For my office, I ordered a sausage pizza, along with a cheese and a veggie (mushroom, onion, pepper); all were fantastic.  I then took home the leftovers and made it an all-pizza kind of day.  Definitely the best takeout I've had in quite a while, but I think the sweetness of the sauce might get old over time."}
{"text":"Small quaint little place if you're not looking for it you'll miss it... Ask for Allison - she'll treat you right!"}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place! Don't see how they could improve in any area. Customer service is excellent, immaculately clean and the food is PERFECTION!"}
{"text":"Love love love. I love food and love pizza! I had never been here before but my parents raved about it. We had a few appetizers and a few pizzas. I was very impressed and can't wait to bring my husband here sometime. I had my little baby with me and our server brought out a little T-shirt for him! It was such a nice gesture."}
{"text":"The most FANTASTIC pizza I have ever had the opportunity to enjoy. I have tried three of their pies and I am currently on a mission to try all of them and still remain thin, it may be hard because every time I am there I stuff my face!

My favorite out of the three that I have tried (The Super Six, Get Meaty and the Chicago) has to be the super six with get meaty coming in second just because I need a little green on my pizza. 

Staff is friendly and quick and the place has a great clean homey vibe. The location is a little hard to find because they are hidden away but it is so worth looking for!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight. It is almost like a hidden away secret. Great service and happy hour specials. The pizza was really great. We tried the Litaliana and the super six and both were excellent. We also tried the bruschetta but I didn't really like it that much but that comes down to just my personal preference."}
{"text":"YES!!! I am really impressed with this place. Three of us arrived on a Friday night and had a 30 minute wait. We were all exhausted and starving, but we couldn't wait to try a new place. We had a beer while we waited and were seated on time. The place is cozy, and the staff is super friendly. 

We started with the cheesy garlic bread. My friends were not excited until they tried it. Oh WOW, it's bursting with flavor. That cheese, that sauce, that garlic, that crunch. Oh. SO. GOOD.

Then we carried on and had their meaty pizza (can't remember the name). It was friggin' amazing! The Italian beef was a really great touch that I didn't anticipate. The sausage had a delightful flavor and wasn't too fennel-y. The sauce is what landed the pizza in my dreams last night. It's a sweet sauce (which might be new to some). It's very close to some great St. Louis style pizzas I've eaten. The crust is crunchy and it's delivered brilliantly on a wire rack (to maintain the crunch). All I can say is: EAT HERE, thank me later."}
{"text":"I ordered the Margherita pizza. it was just ok I have never had one made like I have tasted in New York with fresh balls of mozzarella fresh bail and tomato's. I still will order but maybe ill try something different."}
{"text":"Pizza is always hot and great and never an issue with service at the Tempe location. They do a great job with meeting the needs of their customers and the wait for me has never been longer then 20mins."}
{"text":"After living here for three years, I have finally found delicious pizza.  Great thin crust and good flavors throughout the pizza.

This is the first pizza I have found in Phoenix that I actually want to go back and get some more of!"}
{"text":"This pizza was worth the wait! I can't quite put my finger on what made this pizza so great- maybe it was everything! Great prices too. If you're in town, definitely make this one of your stops!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service.  That pizza sauce is off the hook. I live in California and when I come to AZ I always have to eat here."}
{"text":"My son and I where visiting from California and we love pizza. We came to Phoenix with his travel baseball team and after a game we where both craving some good pizza. Where I'm from there isn't much variety, I'm so used to Pizza Hut and me n eds that a local owned place like this was appealing to me. We ordered a medium pepperoni/ Canadian bacon pizza and garlic bread. When we got it back to the hotel and opened it up I was surprised to see that the pizza was cut tic tac toe style..lol different. The first bit a took I couldn't believe how sweet the sauce was and the pepperonis where amazing! This instantly become the best pizza I've ever had! The garlic sticks where ok.. Good but nothing special. The pizza is what really shined. I was impressed and now that I'm back home all I want is to taste some more!! 

If you find yourself driving around Phoenix looking for a good pizza place to eat in or take out. Please give this place a try! You will not be disappointed..."}
{"text":"Service was great and the pizza was awesome ! Large pizza with half  mamas signature and half super six . 2 of us were full with over half a pizza to take home."}
{"text":"I had high hopes that I would really enjoy this. It's husband birthday and he loves pizza. All the positive reviews made us want to try it. 35.00 later and an entire box of sweet pizza \"cake\" and were heading home to find something to eat. The restaurant was really cute and the staff and service was great. However the thick pizza crust and sauce was really not good at all. The sauce was extremely sweet. And the thick crust texture and taste was bland. Certainly will not return. If you want great pizza stick to oreganos"}
{"text":"A taste of Chicago in Arizona!  Deliciously seasoned food. The Greek salad was crunchy and dressed to perfection. The baked artichoke crostini was superb. The Super Six pizza was beyond words with the sauce, flavorful meat and cheese. Check out this great dine-in pizzeria!"}
{"text":"This location may not be typical of Spinato's, but it is pretty old looking and cramped, almost as if the seating areas were jammed in wherever a little space could be found.  It's not uncomfortable, however, and the service is prompt and friendly.  The pizza is good too, served on a wire rack above a metal pan, which keeps its thin crust from getting soggy. Ample toppings and cheese are fine, too, although I wish they offered bacon.  The sauce is tasty but sweet, which is kind of old-fashioned, but entirely to my taste.  If you like it that way, you won't be able to do much better than Spinato's.

Hint: I've also had their carry out, but like all pizzas, its much better fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Wow. 

I could eat here for days and days. Thankfully, I don't or my blood would turn into that amazing, sweet sauce that they put on that beautiful crust. 

Spinato's has the best pizza in the Valley. Only better I've ever had was for $1 on a corner in New York. 

They have gluten-free options. My boyfriend swears by their sandwiches, but I refuse to try them because I just love the pizza too much. We also get the cheesy GF bread sometimes and it's delicious. They can even make gluten-free food taste amazing. 

Weird location, but they deliver!"}
{"text":"They have some good pizza here. The dinner salad was interesting and very tasteful. The staff was friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Amazing true Italian food.  Try the Mama's Signature Calzone with spinach, tomatoes, garlic & mozzarella.  Add ricotta, artichoke hearts, mushroom, and roasted red peppers!   It's to die for!  If you are Italian or from back east and you miss the good stuff, you will appreciate this place.  They always have fresh ingredients & great service."}
{"text":"Pizza is aaaaaamazing.  The calzones are delicious too.  The spaghetti stuffed calzone is awesome too. This place is a must go if youre in the area.  Actually I'm sitting here for my second meal within a week"}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had!! 

I dream about this pizza, no other pizza comes close... I feel like I'm cheating on Spinato's when I eat other pizza. That's how good it is! Spinato's is an all around great restaurant, family owned, service is friendly and accommodating... good for dates, dinner to catch up with a friend, lunch with a coworker, great for a group dinner for a birthday or just family. 

I usually start off with the garlic bread, which comes with marinara sauce.. But I recommend making it a little more fun by adding mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and tomato. The salads are tasty and come in a good sized portion... For example, a side salad is good for 2, entree is good for 2-3. My go to pizza is the Mamma Spinato's which includes spinach, tomatoes, garlic, and toasty cheese tossed with love! I always add onions for that extra kick.. Pizzas can be shared and split into 2 different combinations (they even separate it with a line of tomato sauce so you know which is which) dessert is the only department they lack in.. Cannoli's are no bueno :( the dough tastes old and the cream filling is too sweet.  Overall, this is definitely on my top favorite list of restaurants in the valley.. Eating here always makes my day.. Heck even my week!! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust for carry-out one evening.  The place was somewhat hidden in an industrial area close to Tempe Marketplace.  The staff was very friendly and it seemed like a laid-back, cozy place to eat a meal.

I enjoyed my pizza.  The sauce tasted very sweet so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"We were dropping off my daughter at ASU and was looking for a place close by. We came across Spinato's. Hidden in the business park but found it cause of all the cars. This is a very small place and were seated right next to the window with the light shining in our eyes. They were nice enough to pull the shades down. 

We ordered the Family Caesar Salad with grilled chicken. Huge bowl and we had plenty for all four of us. Salad was crisp and lots of chicken. It was really good. 

We ordered the thin crust Chicago Pizza which came with home made sausage and green and red pepper mix. Such a really good pizza. Sausage was really good and the peppers were really good. We gobbled it all up. 

The service was really good. She was really quick with our drink orders and filled them up in a timely manner. She always asked about our meal and they exchanged our plates when we finished our salad. Always looking out for us. We left and my daughter left her keys on the table and they ran outside to make sure we didn't forget her keys. Very cool. 

Good pizza, good salad, good service. Do you need anything else? I think not. So enjoy."}
{"text":"My in-laws took my husband and I out to lunch here after church one Sunday.  We had to wait about 5 minutes for the place to open at noon.  Their menu is quite extensive when it comes to pizzas - different toppings, crust styles, and sizes.  I ordered the \"Nicole's special\" - salami, artichokes, and onion - Lil' size - pan/thick crust.  What I ordered was just the right size for a lunch or dinner serving especially if you don't want to have to worry about any leftovers.  The crust was crunchy yet soft and tasty.  The prices are pretty average but the service is attentive.  It can get a little noisy in this place very easily so keep that in mind if you are looking for a more quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered the handmade sausage and mushroom pizza and it was delicious. They were friendly and very fast. It's worth the money."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to get gluten free pizza. Their ingredients are so fresh and their crust doesn't make you feel as if you are eating something gluten free. I love how their salad dressings are all homemade and that they are very tentative on if you order gluten free to take out the croutons in the salad. Spinach special is one of my favorite as well as the Chicago and Nicole's!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: very cozy, great for family or groups, but they have a small seating area.

Service: very courteous & prompt.

Food: This is now my favorite pizza place!  We started off with some bruschetta.  It was crunchy & full of flavor.  The pepperoncini rings gave it a little kick!  For pizza, we got the Mama Spinato's \"Signature\" Fresh Pizza.  I love the way they cut the pizza for you.  It wasn't the traditional big triangular slices.  They were cut into small squares, which made it so much easier to share, and to portion yourself.  The crust is thin, so it wasn't overwhelmingly doughy.  My sister ordered the same specialty pizza but gluten-free.  The crust wasn't as sweet, but still good for being gluten-free.  Definitely beats Picazzo's gluten-free crust in terms of taste.

I am addicted!"}
{"text":"The pictures and menu looked amazing! However this was a huge disappointment.  Italian sub would have been delicious except for the over cooked roast beef added.  It was gross.  The pizza crust was doughy, the sauce bland and oddly sweet and again had the over cooked roast beef.  The flavoring was off.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Good Chicago thin crust pizza! Their home made sausage is the best I have had west of the mississippi.
good for carry out or dine in when the place isn't packed"}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome! We tried the cheesy garlic bread, salad, and 2 pizzas for 6 of us. Service was quick and friendly. The pizza sauce is different than most, due to the sweetness, but it's very unique. I would definitely go back again and recommend their food. The only drawback is no alcohol served here-I've never seen a pizza place without alcohol."}
{"text":"Spinato's is by far our favorite pizza! But, this location has a limited menu & is very crowded, this is why the 4 stars, but the thin crust pizza is 5+, yum!"}
{"text":"Only every had the pizza, when in the area we stop here. Just wish it was closer to me.  The sauce is unique and wonderful."}
{"text":"Kept meaning to come here after going to the one in Scottsdale ages ago! Ordered a small pesto pizza to split with the love and our 2 friends split a small combo pizza between them. Was plenty of food for us. Server Brad was nice and we left a big tip."}
{"text":"I checked this place out this weekend with my boyfriend and thought that it was great! I've heard amazing things about Spinato's (best pizza in Tempe) & definitely thought that it lived up to expectations. We ordered an entree of the Caesar Salad [10/10] and a medium Super Six [10/10], which was more than enough for the both of us! Can't wait to return here...or order delivery :)"}
{"text":"This, to me is the worlds best pizza, they have a gluten-free, that taste just like the regular. Absolutely delicious. I almost am afraid to share this review as it's just a tiny place and it's always very busy. They treat you like family, and their sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a warehouse area near Tempe Marketplace, this small pizza restaurant is a force to be reckoned with. The tomato sauce in their pies is amazing with a distinct sweetness. Any toppings you get are just icing on an already superior pizza. The garlic bread was also the best I've had in a long time. Stuffed myself and had to take home all the leftovers."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Strong Italian flavors and combinations. They have the Best Gluten Free pizza and garlic bread. This is also a great place to go for a meal - great atmosphere.  I work about 2 miles away, so I was so excited when they started delivery! :)"}
{"text":"I came in because my fianc√©, who used to live in Tempe, was obsessed with their pizza. I came in to bring him a take and bake pizza home to Denver. I ended up eating while I ordered- the customer service was amazing. The server had the chef come out and talk to me about the best way to safely get my fiance's pizza back to Colorado. They were so nice and the food was great also!!!"}
{"text":"On any day I'd give Spinato's a 5 star, the pizza, the best and that's all the matters to me. Great thin crust, sweet sauce, savory cheese... However I called the Tempe location for 20min straight while driving only to get there and see they're closed for a kitchen remodeling. What the hell? I checked Google hours, Yelp and the site to make sure of the hours and there's NO NOTICE. Told everyone I was bringing zah and I was by the Phoenix location but decided to go to Tempe because my final stop was closer... Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"WORST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD TO CONSUME!!! I ordered delivery last night(3/25/12) just before they closed at 8pm. The only reason we ordered from here was for a friends b-day who told us this place was great from his previous visits. He was unfortunately, terribly wrong. To add salt to the wounds the pizzas I ordered were outrageously expensive at $45($36 for pizza) total including delivery charge and tip. 

We ordered a large \"Super six\"(sausage, pepperoni, ham, mushroom, green peppers, & mozzarella) and a small pepperoni. It was more like the Super disgusting pizza, the crust tasted like over-cooked, stale, cardboard similar to that of a $1 Totinos FROZEN pizza. The sauce has a strange tangy flavor to it and the toppings were flavorless. Not only that but it took them over 45 minutes from start to finish to deliver it(we live 4 miles from them). My friend who raved about the pizza even said it didn't taste the same. 

My partner and I were polite and ate the pizza in front of him but once he left we threw away the leftovers.(which was quite a lot) Not only that but they show off some 2008 \"Best food winner\" from the Scottsdale culinary festival. All I know for sure is those judges probably had absolutely no taste buds. They aren't open today(monday) but believe me, I'm calling to complain tomorrow and ask for a refund."}
{"text":"This place has the best gluten-free pizza in town. Even if you aren't gluten free if you like thin crust, you will love Spinato's gluten-free pizza. I got it to go so can't speak to the restaurant ambiance, but staff were very pleasant. I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Happy hour is is the best!!! Always affordable and always delicious. Everyone at the Tempe location is so friendly and we never leave not satisfied. Everything on the menu is great and their gluten free pizza is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Saw an ad for this place while at the Cubs vs Angels game and decided to give it a shot post game! Best decision ever! 
It's a little hole in the wall pizza place so be careful or you'll drive right by it. 
By the looks of it the wait can get pretty long depending on your party size. We got there at a pretty decent time so the wait was about 10min. 
Friends and I order side salads (Greek & a caesar) and a medium Chicago Pizza! It was amazing! We inhaled our food (we were pretty hungry since our last meal was brunch) 
Service is amazing. Mary (I think) was our server. She was super friendly and really makes sure you're enjoying yourself. 
Will definitely come back next time I visit Arizona!"}
{"text":"Randomly found this pizza place while in Mesa for a class for a week. WOW! Top notch pizza. The amount of sauce, toppings and cheese was perfect. Their pizza sauce is fantastic. My coworker and I ate in since we were traveling back to Tucson that evening. Both of us were blown away by their pizza and ordered a large to take home to Tucson. My teenage son isn't easily impressed with any food place, but he loved this pizza. We'll have to flip a coin between Spinato's and Hanny's when we're in the Phoenix metro area. Great pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! I love \"mama's spinach pizza\" and I never would order something like this usually, but everything about it is exactly right. Especially if you ask for the bottom extra-crispy. One thing unique about their pizza is their sauce. It's got some sweetness to it--nothing overpowering, just an undertone, but I think some people might not like it. Some other things to try are the meatball appetizer, the Greek salad, and the spaghetti calzone. 

My issue here is that the Tempe location is really small with only a handful of tables. You can wait 2 hours on a Friday or Saturday night because there is no place to seat you. And no reservations. I suggest TAKE OUT OR DELIVERY ONLY."}
{"text":"First review was good. Here's an update. Came here last week with my friend... TWICE. It's so freaking good, and the service was on point this time, with zero delays in being seated and waited on. The Spaghetti Calzone is her favorite but she also got a ham and pineapple... She devoured it, it was crazy. I had a slice and I'm not a huge fan of pineapples on my pizza, but I must say it was definitely tasty. And I finally got to try a pepperoni and jalape√±o... \"Got me like 'Oh My Gosh I'm so in love... I found you finally' \"... This is now my #1 favorite pizza on the face of the earth. The sweet sauce with the spicy jalape√±os and pepperoni was just MMMM! I'm about to go have me some Spinato's RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"my favorite pizza ever.

the mama's signature pizza is good.. and garlic-y, but so worth it! 

your friends might not like your breath afterwards, but your stomach will sure thank you :)

i have tried a few other pizzas there too, and they were good.. and the canolis were yummy as well!"}
{"text":"My wife had eaten here with several of her coworkers and had been begging to take me here.  Yesterday I ate at Spinato's Pizza for the first time.  We ordered the combo pizza with sausage, mushrooms and sweet peppers.  It's a better than average pizza at a fair price.

The positive:  Pizza has lots of toppings.  Very generous toppings.
The negative:  The pizza sauce is very sweet.  It's really a strange, sweet taste.

I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  If the pizza sauce was better, I'd give it a full 5 stars."}
{"text":"Wow, we've been missing out, should've tried this a lot sooner. Our NYE at home featured pizza and tiki drinks. My bf called for take-out (I figured it would be at least an hour wait), and they told him 20 minutes, nice! It wasn't hard to find, though definitely not in a well-traveled area. Actually, had it been across Rio Salado in the Tempe Marketplace, we would not have tried it, because I HATE HATE HATE Tempe Marketplace, but that's another story. 

We got the thin crust option with italian sausage, mushrooms and olives. So good!! like other reviewers said, the sauce is unbelievable. I wish I knew their secret. 

What a great find in our (relative) neighborhood. I can't wait to try Spinato's again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Being a Chi town native I've tried nearly all the pizza joints in Tempe & Scottsdale & no other place comes close! The sauce is sweet & thick, crispy crust & fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  After having friends tell me this was outstanding pizza I could not wait to go.  The positives are the pizza is not expensive and they don't skimp on the toppings.  The negative is that the pizza just tasted like cardboard.  It was very average at best.  Also no booze"}
{"text":"This is our absolute favorite pizza chain where we go and we also take our out of town guests. Everyone enjoys the food. Our latest trick here is to order a half and half Pizza with the get meaty and Mama's signature then combine it on your plate into a pizza sandwich, the flavors combine magically to make the best tasting thing you've ever put in your mouth. I really want to trade mark that with them and put my name on it."}
{"text":"When I first arrived I wasn't sure If I came to the right  location because I was surrounded by warehouses. My party was seated fairly quickly, we ordered our pizza and the food came out at a respectable time. The sauce was a little too sweet for me at first but then it grew on me. I really enjoyed the pizza and the cheesecake for the dessert. The staff is very friendly and attentive, and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"This is a really great pizza place.  They dont serve alcohol, but the food is bomb.  The staff is friendly and the environment inside is cozy."}
{"text":"Simply the best pizza I have ever tasted. It's all about their pizza sauce. It is amazing and it doesn't get any better than this. Granted the restaurant has been under construction for what seems like an eternity and it looks more like an old abandoned warehouse rather than a restaurant, however, their pizza is unlike anything I have ever tasted.   Yum!"}
{"text":"I've had this place a few times and haven't been in for a while but I figure I'll throw my two cents in. This place is good for pizza if you're looking for something different. It's hidden away on a side street so it obviously has some followers or else it would probably have trouble staying in business. I've only eaten in a couple times and from what I remember the service was fine basically what you would expect from a little pizza place. The reason I give it three stars is because it doesn't draw me back. The pizza wasn't bad at all but maybe the sweet sauce thing just isn't for me. It is different though so it's easily worth a try and I honestly would probably be back every once in a while if only for a change of pace from standard pizza places except that I usually don't even think about it since as I said it is kind of hidden away. I actually probably should stop in again and when I do I'll make sure to throw an update on this review."}
{"text":"Soo good! One of our fav spot. This and oreganos! :) The lemonade is my favorite and the meat lovers pizza!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, we found Spinato's on Yelp and placed an order for pickup. We ordered the Signature Spinach and the Get Meaty, which were ready exactly when they said. We were blown away!!! Have tried some other places in Phoenix that people had raved about but this blew all of them out of the water. Seriously amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Their spaghetti calzone is the best calzone I have ever had. Their signature spinach-tomato-garlic pizza is not my fav. pizza though. I like their spicy italian pizza with easy onions. Their sauce is very sweet, but it really is addicting! Get the thick crust, I think it is way better than their thin."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza. Lots a varieties, they have you staples and some interesting ones. Priced reasonable and great service. Could use a TV or two for games, which I wanted to pay attention to when I was there. Good Gluten free pizza crust as well."}
{"text":"Went in because I heard this place had really good pizza. Ordered some cheese bread and meatballs as an appetizer and a large Sicilian pizza. Everything was outstanding including the server who was on top of clearing away garbage/plates and keeping the glasses filled. She also answered a bunch of questions about the menu and explained everything before putting in the order. I absolutely will be back here."}
{"text":"Hands down best Spinach Calzones I've ever eaten!!!  A family owned business that gets REALLY PACKED!  Make sure if you are there you are prepared to wait sometimes because it is almost always busy the food is so good!"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants but today's delivery girl was a little ray of sunshine! Such a refreshing change from most delivery people! Thank you spinatos for being a cut Above!"}
{"text":"I love the thin crust classic signature.  So does my mom.  My husband thinks the sauce is too sweet...but his opinion doesn't really count.

I tried the antipasto with the house italian.  pretty decent salad for a pizza joint!

We ordered online and picked it up...I am always a fan of not having to call and place an order.  I have an aversion to talking on the phone.  I have no idea why."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing and the Cesar salad was fantastic :) ordered the caprese and cheesy garlic bread and they were both phenomenal! Our waitress Maria was so nice and friendly and earned herself a pretty good tip!! LOVE THIS PLACE :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fabulous, for many reasons.  

First and foremost, the food.  I ordered two large pizzas to go (cheese and vegetarian).  Both were absolutely delicious!  The crust is thin and light, the cheese melts in your mouth, the sauce ultra flavorful, and the veggies were fresh and cooked to perfection.  It was a definite hit with everyone.

The location is a bit hidden (it's in an industrial neighborhood), but still very convenient as it is right across the street from Tempe Marketplace.  The interior was charming, with brick walls and small tables - reminescint of what I envision a small pizza parlor in Italy to look and feel like.

Although the prices are higher than you would find at a Dominos or Pizza Hut, so is the quality of the food - therefore, worth the extra few bucks.

Finally, the staff was amazing.  I had approached the manager for a small food donation for a local charity, and he went above and beyond to provide us with ample food for all involved and made our charity experience that much more memorable.

Overall, this place is definitely worth a stop (or two, or three)!"}
{"text":"Spinatos is up there with some if the best pizza I've had in the valley. The pizza and calzones are beautifully crafted and cooked. The flavored were right on point. Their sauce is sweeter than a lot of other pizza sauces which I have a happen to have soft spot for. 

The sauce was the high point for me but don't get me wrong, there were many other great aspects. The crust and ingredients on both the thin crust pizza and the calzone was also very tasty. 

Lastly, service was good and prices were reasonable. Spinatos has earned a spot towards the top of my pizza list."}
{"text":"Before I went to Spinatos, after reading all the great reviews, I thought the best Pizza I ever had was at John's on Bleecker Street in NYC. WOW! Spinato's is just as good. Crust, Sauce, Toppings, Flavor were fantastic. Service was good too. Don't pass this place up! It is great!!!"}
{"text":"AMAZING pizza.

What else do you need to know?

Staff has always been nice and helpful.  Nothing tops the food though..."}
{"text":"Definitely the best pizza in Tempe, possibly the best in the state.  The sauce sets it apart from other places.  Baby spinach is delicious too.  

I can see why people would be disappointed that they don't serve alcohol here; that would make the place even better, but it's just a pizza joint, not an Oregano's type place.  Order for pick up and enjoy it at home."}
{"text":"I love pizza and tried Spinato's after reading other Yelp reviews.  I had a Greek salad and a $9.00 Happy Hour Pizza Special.  Both were delicious!  I was delightfully surprised with the quality and amount of toppings.   The crust is thin and cooked to order.  I prefer extra crispy.  IMO, I thought the sauce could have been more 'zesty', you know, Italian style...but it won't stop me from coming back.  Atmosphere is casual.  Lots of windows and bright light.  Our waitress was sweet and it's nearby so BIG bonus."}
{"text":"The pie is pricey and sweet but you'll be back! Great mom-n-pop shop feel, good service, sometimes a long wait but you'll understand why."}
{"text":"Tucked away but close to Tempe Marketplace is this delicious Chicagan pizza place. The staff was friendly and worked well as a team.They made a split pie for me 1/2 Hawaiian and 1/2 Supreme.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the wait was far too long. Called in around 6:40 pm tonight and ordered one small pizza. They told me it would be about an hour. I thought that was kind of long considering the size of my order and how closely I'm located, but it is a Friday night, so I assumed they'd be busier than normal. Over an hour later, I still didn't have my pizza delivered. Called back and said the driver left 15 minutes ago so he should be there any minute. He didn't arrive for an additional 15 minutes after I hung up with the employee. When the driver finally did reach my house, I asked him how his night was going, and if it was really busy (which one could naturally infer given the total wait). To my surprise, he said, \"no, not really.\" Which makes me think that they just don't know how to properly monitor tickets and/or the driver didn't care about getting the food over in a timely manner. I'd be willing to try it again at the restaurant, but this wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good! Not a place you expect when driving through a warehouse district either! My boyfriend and I got a deepdish pizza and it was absolutely delicious! Even though it was packed, we got a table pretty quickly and quality service. The pricing was not bad at all and the food came out quickly. We have only been here once so far but we do plan to go again!

The place had a good relaxed atmosphere and was very pleasant for a couple on a date or families. There were tons of kids there after all, so I can tell you it was good for them! The waitress we had was very personable and extremely nice. She never once let our glasses go empty and was very prompt. She also gave us updates on how our pizza was coming along. 

The only negative point were the drink prices, wowza. Water there from now on."}
{"text":"It really is as good as it gets at Spinato's. I'm originally from Chicago and have never had any luck finding good Chicago-style thin crust ANYWHERE in the valley. My boyfriend picked up Spinato's on a whim a week or so ago and I had to keep myself from eating the entire pie!

The sauce is amazing - completely full of flavor. The crust is thin and flaky on the edges, and they cut their slices in SQUARES - my favorite. We just got the cheese for our first time, because if a place has good CHEESE pizza, all of the rest of their pizza will be good.

This is the best Chicago style pizza in Arizona. Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Yum! You usually couldn't get my husband to touch spinach but the Mama's Original gets him his greens. We discovered Spinatos at the Culinary Festival years ago and have been going back since. We love the fact that its a family-owned business and that all the teenage kids work the place. The food portions are generous, the restaurant has a great Italian pizza place feel and they send you coupons for your birthday! Can't beat that. 

I'd suggest for take-out or for a very casual meal out. Not a date night kind of place."}
{"text":"I have been to the Spinato's in Phoenix and enjoyed it. This location I'd unique in the franchise. There is no alcohol whatsoever served here so be advised, also the pizza did not taste as it normally does the 3 times I have been here. Also like all Spinatos they are closed on Monday. They have like 9 tables, a single picture on the wall... its really depressing. You'd figure the service would be a lot more personable because the server only had one other table, it wasn't. I saw the other server morw which made it awkward when it came to the tip because I didn't know who to tip. I expected a lot more. The food was bland... if you like Spinatos, just avoid this location. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"I find myself having dreams about this pizza... It is that good!  I feel sorry for people who continue to frequent places like Dominos, Papa Johns and Pizza Hut.  

Most of all - I'm absolutely THRILLED that they have a location in the Tuke.  Unfortunately - like all their locations they don't take reservations so either get their early, plan on a 25-45 minute wait or get takeout.  Whatever the case - don't forgo this pizza!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizzeria I have been to in a while. Their glutton free options are excellent and the cheese and mushroom Pizza was really well done. Will definitely have to visit again or do delivery. Love this place. Service was great."}
{"text":"I ordered a small 11 inch vegetarian special pizza for lunch planning to keep half of it for dinner.  The pizza was so good that I finished it. Would recommend this place and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have never dined in at Spinatos, however i get delivery or takeout quite often.  I love their pizza, love the way they cut it and the taste is great.  I have met the owner and he is a kind man with a loyal following of workers that love what they do. A+ food."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I'd definitely go back. We ordered the antipasto salad and the combo pizza. The salad was nice and fresh,  the dressing was good and there was a good amount of it. The pizza has a great flavor and the toppings were good quality. The only thing I didn't like was that the dough portion of the pizza is not crispy so if you try to pick it up to eat it all of the toppings kind of just slide off. I realize this might be the style of the pizza but I just prefer there to be some crunch to my thin crust. Otherwise the atmosphere there was good,  the server friendly and the prices affordable."}
{"text":"VERY Good thin crust pizza. Our favorite pizza place in Arizona. Closest to thin crust Chicago pizza you will find in AZ."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza and friendly service!! Tempe is the original Spinatos location - the real deal! New General Manager, Fred is awesome!! Super nice man and fellow \"Chicago-an\" with Midwest hospitality. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Overall we had an ok experience.  We went on a Friday night so there was about a 20 minute wait, which wasn't too bad.  There wasn't very much seating and the waiting area got a little crowded.  The Margherita Pizza was very good.  The crust was buttery and delicious.  Even though the food was good, our service experience was not so great.  My boyfriend got one of the specialty pizzas and asked for it to come with onions instead of mushrooms.  Little did we know that this was considered \"building your own pizza\" and as a result we were charged more.  When the bill came and we asked about it, the server's response was it's written on the menu.  This would have been a great thing to mention while we were ordering especially since we told her it was our first visit.  We also ordered a kid's meal and were charged an extra fifty cents for apple juice instead of soda, which again, was not disclosed.  The manager did agree to remove the fifty cent charge but at that point, our experience was ruined.  The pizza was good but we probably won't dine in again."}
{"text":"We ordered their garlic cheese bread and it was great along with the Big Meat Pizza we picked up.  I like that their sauce isn't like every other pizza sauce I've ever had.  The pizza was great, the order was hot when it arrived and it all tasted great!  I recommend highly!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have tried many pizza joints but Spinato's is by far the best place we've eaten in AZ! 2 very enthusiastic thumbs up for this pizza place,  we'll definitely be back. The food was amazing and the staff was pleasant and just plain awesome!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful Chicago pizza. The last in Arizona ! We got the thin crust sausage pizza, garlic breadsticks and stuffed mushrooms. Everything was perfect. Recommended by a friend and I am extending the recommendation!"}
{"text":"I have had pizza from here a few times, with mixed results, but generally positive. I usually get thin crust, which I like very much, but tonight we got a thick crust.... I wasn't a fan, but the BF really enjoyed it. I thought it was too bread -y. We also got some garlic bread with tomatoes, mozz, and basil.... This was super delicious! I could just eat this for a meal.... probably a really unhealthy meal that will leave me smelling of garlic for a few days..... but it's totally worth it.  

So this location is a cute little hidden restaurant. The people are always friendly when I have gone to pick up, but I haven't eaten in the restaurant. I also really like that I can order online.... since I hate talking to people on the phone and all. So go Spinato's!"}
{"text":"My whole family went here last night for my oldest brother's birthday. This restaurant was very accommodating to our large party. They even sat us before everyone was there, and we appreciated that. We ordered a bunch of food, a couple pizzas, a couple sandwiches, bruschetta, salad, ravioli, meatballs.... a lot of food. Their pizza is always good and my brother swears that this location is the best and has the best crust of all the locations. I thought the pizza was good, the italian salad dressing was very good, and the ravioli and meatballs were tasty. I thought the bruschetta was just ok... but overall, this place is very good. I would recommend it to anyone for some classic italian food, plus about 10 of us ate for 100$....pretty good deal."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best pizza in Phoenix. Actually, I think it is the best pizza I have ever had. I order the Super Six, and it is amazing, each and every time I get it. Everyone I have introduced it to agrees....will not be disappointed. This location is very small, but I typically get take out, so that doesnt matter."}
{"text":"I went to the Cubs new spring training stadium the other day and unfortunately the game was cancelled due to rain. (I know rain at spring training in Arizona, wth).  Anyways my family and I were starving so went to yelp and found that this place was less than 5 minutes from the stadium.  The only complaint I have is it's easy to miss this place but besides that the pizza was amazing.  Honestly some of the best I've ever had, no lie.  We ordered the bread with cheese for an appetizer and it was bomb.  When then ordered the family Caesar salad which was good but the pizza.    We got 2 small pizzas, the spinach mama's special and the meaty.  I kinda like spinach but it sounded good so we went with it.   I am so glad we did because I didn't think I could love spinach that much.  I honestly wish I could have another slice now as I type this.  The meaty one was good too.  Some how we saved room for dessert and we got the cannoli and the brownie with ice cream.  Both desserts were great too.   So if you're in the mood for pizza you have to check this place out.  Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"It's good pizza, a lot like Oregano's thin crust but with much less salt. The sauce is sweet. Definitely good by Phoenix standards and all of chains. But that's not saying much. I just had the delivery which was to Dobson & Broadway in Mesa, which is good coverage.

There's a thin-crust pizza place called Fricano's in Michigan that blows this place away."}
{"text":"We had the meatballs for appetizer (SO GOOD).  I am not really a meatball fan but the husband is.  I would order these again in a heartbeat.  I might not even share.  Next, we had the Spicy Italian pizza.  It was good.  The sauce they use is slightly sweet which I enjoyed.  I am not from Phoenix, but if I ever come back I would definitely head there to get some pie. YUM."}
{"text":"It's edible. I'm used to New York and New Haven style pizza. It's some of the best in the country, if not the best. This pizza reminds me of Dominos."}
{"text":"OK, my boss went here often for years, so I finally checked it out and we have been back with friends several times. Still need to try that spaghetti calzone I heard about, but every pizza has been really good. It will actually be hard to make myself order anything besides the MARGHERITA pizza, because it is . . . well it's absolutely PERFECT. The various groups I have brought to Spinato's have all been impressed!

Return visit: We were determined to try more options, so we just came back from getting a Chicago steak calzone (they'll add more spicy peppers if you're adventurous), and a turkey pesto sandwich with a side Caesar. A little bit more dressing than I would put on, but I'm peculiar that way. The dressing was actually outstanding, and everything else was great as well. Definitely still fans!!"}
{"text":"This place has been long time favorite. Service is always good and the food is great.
They have a happy hour that features $3 appetizers. My favorites are the meatball trio in vodka sauce and the garlic cheese bread."}
{"text":"As pizza lovers, this is some of the best pizza in town. The service was fast, helpful, and very friendly; they all seemed happy to work there. We were checked on by our server frequently. The location is a little hard to find, as there is no prominent sign visible from the street, but this wasn't  enough to give less than five stars. We started with the garlic mozzarella bread and meatball trio appetizers, both delicious and hot. The combo pizza was spectacular (and HUGE. When they say \"large\", they mean it!) and the cannoli were the crown jewel of the meal; delicious, perfectly portioned, reasonably priced,  and beautifully presented. We found our new pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place one more star than I normally would because I feel like I'm reviewing it for Husband and I.
I like Spinato's pretty okay.
Husband? Yeah, he freaking LOVES Spinato's.
The pizza is nice and thin crust, and while the last time I was there it was being renovated, the decor is nice and casual. We usually get take out, and the pizza is just as good the next day.
What makes Spinato's unique, is the pizza sauce. It's really sweet - and not \"your teeth will fall out\" sweet, but there's a slight sweetness that adds another dimension to the pie.
It's definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite go to pizza spot!
NEED I say more! The place is always full of smiling guest and staff! The Ambience and atmosphere although is joyful. I've been here a few times and i can't say I ever seen an out of order or dirty establishment. If you go the this location you won't receive bad customer service or cold food. I'd recommend this place to anyone check out the pics. Mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"SWEET pizza.  As in sugar in the tomato sauce kinda pizza.  The texture/the crust is all good, but the sauce was too sweet for me and my teenagers said the same.  I thought it was pricey for a thin crust cheese at 16.00.

  They are friendly, have great service, but the sauce is just too sweet for us.   We like more savory flavors.  Glad we tried it as they are local and we'd recommend to people who are ok with this type of pizza.  It is cut checkerboard style... so you have to like that too. :-)  Although they are very accomodating, they'd likely cut it in wedges if you asked."}
{"text":"Tonight we paid $50 for pizza... Here's how:

We wanted to buy dinner for my Father and he is a fan of the bake-at-home style that we have tried from other places in the past. We are huge fans of the sauce here and were excited to try their version of the bake-at-home. We dropped off a 3/4 cooked pizza at the house for pops to start and ran to go get drinks while it cooked... We came back to a kitchen full of smoke and my Father panicking :( We thought that the inner liner under the pizza was the provided cooking sheet.. This was not the case. My Father couldn't get is out on his own and was afraid of it catching everything on fire. We help him get it out and it was completely inedible, cardboard lining scorched with ash and pieces throughout the pie, and our oven destroyed. 

I called and told them what happened and said I needed another one and they placed a second order. We get to the place and are charged for a second pie. 

Don't get me wrong the oven incident was our fault (minus the lack of proper cook-at-home product), but we had another small incident from this location the last time we ordered from here that was quite revealing of their business practices. I ordered two sides of their sauce and was only given one. When I told them about the last incident today, they ignored my concern, charged me for two again and assured me that they would make sure I received all sauces THIS time. 

The second pizza was as good as usual, but they were not concerned about my experience in either situation. I wonder if their business objective is customer centric or more about maximizing working capital. They have lost both in us."}
{"text":"When my boss orders us supervisors lunch, he always gets Spinato's!  I'm more excited about having it than I am having him pay for it!
I love the square pieces and thin crust.
And, yes, there is just something about the sauce!"}
{"text":"This is a weird location, note that they don't serve alcohol. The pizza was really good as per the few times I have eaten spinatos pizza but the bruschetta was just awful. The service was ok-ish. Either way I would probably go back for at very least the good pizza. Also maybe get a real ice machine, that tiny pebble ice was not great."}
{"text":"It seems that every which way you turn these days there are more and more gluten free pizza options showing up around the valley. Pizza joints around Phoenix have all gotten on the bandwagon since they see how big a demand there is for gluten free pizza in Arizona and how our little community votes heavily with our dollars - even in our current economic climate. Will I pay $15 bucks for a good gluten free pizza? You betcha!

Spinato's was recommended to me by my co-worker as the best place for pizza in Phoenix. That was a pretty bold statement to make since there are so many good pizza places in town, and boy, Gary was right. I was blown away by Spinato's.

First of all, the pizzeria is tucked away in a business park behind Tempe Marketplace and unless you know someone \"in the know\" you'd probably never stumble upon it yourself. This place is no frills - block walls, old concrete floors, and simple table setups, but the food is far from simple. It's fresh, cooked to order, and the service was fantastic.

They have an entire menu devoted to gluten free item's, so there's no guesswork involved with ingredients or which combo's you can eta, etc..... I had the \"Nicole's Favorite\" pizza, which is Gluten Free Creations Signature crust, topped generously with slices of Genoa salami, artichoke hearts, onions, and lightly sprinkled with mozzarella cheese. It was perfecto!

Now, let's talk about the sauce. I think their pizza sauce may actually be the best pizza sauce I've ever had. It was slightly sweet with loads of fresh tomato flavor, and perfectly seasoned. Each bite was a perfect balance and I had to refrain from eating the whole darn pizza so I didn't look like a total pig to my new co-workers. I politely took half home and then devoured the rest at 4:00 as a late afternoon lunch.  \"Nicole's Favorite\" is now \"Jessica's Favorite! Well done Spinato's!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I am giving this place 5 stars but after two visits in one week, it is well worth it. After buying one of those playing card decks with restaurant discounts, we finally tried Spinato's (after living in Phoenix since 2003). Yes, I fully realize how ridiculous it is that I hadn't been here sooner. 

There are so many great things about this restaurant ranging from the service, food, deals (coupon and daily deals), and conveniences (order ahead while waiting for a table). From the time we sat down (both visits), the service was top-notch and friendly. 

First visit, we had the specialty spinach pizza with plenty of garlic and tomatoes ($15 for a medium). It was delicious but way too much pizza for us 4 when we paired it when their large order of ravioli and two meatball. That was so good too! Oh did I forget to mention the garlic cheese bread that we ordered with the baked bread and butter. Both, simply amazing. Clearly I was aiming for the food going straight towards my waistline. I also had a glass of wine since they are half off on Sundays and made sure to get some of their chocolate chip cookies to go. 

For the second visit (a week later), we dialed it back a bit. Of course we had to have the garlic cheese bread, kids ravioli ($5 for the ravioli, a breadstick, drink, and scoop of gelato), small specialty pizza ($10 and plenty for my husband and son to share) and I had the \"lil\" spinach calzone (7\" for $5). That calzone was so delicious, I couldn't save the half I set aside for lunch. Add two glasses of wine (half off), and two piccola brownie desserts, and our total bill was $45. For a family of four with drinks, an appetizer and 2 desserts???? Pretty damn reasonable in this day in age. And it has been a long time since I was that blissfully satisfied with a meal (or two). Well done Spinato's, well done."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I've ever had. Just had it for the first time and can't stop eating it. This is what my friend brought home:

L'Italiana................................................... 7.50 | 12.25 | 17.50 | 22.00

Fresh baby spinach carefully marinated in Mamma Spinato's 'Secret Seasonings', then baked with fire roasted red peppers and a blend of feta and mozzarella cheese! Our award winner!

This pizza is phenomenal. He added meatball and ricotta. I can't wait to order from here again!"}
{"text":"Love the pizza, especially the homemade sauce. Can't beat the Italian bread either. Fantastic restaurant, would recommend this place to anyone looking for local pizza thats leaps and bounds above any chain store."}
{"text":"This place has the one of the best pies I have had.

I had to call to ask where they were located because they are hidden right across Fisher's Tools (ha).  Once we found them, it was golden just like the crust of their pizza. 

Started off with a salad with fresh vegetables and ordered Mama Spinato's Signature Fresh Spinach Pizza.  

The pizza smothered with mozzarella cheese and \"secret seasonings\" spinach and tomatoes.  It makes my mouth water just trying to describe.  Each slice is pretty heavy and had about 3 slices but wanted MORE! It's the favorite we were told which makes sense. We going back!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time with Spinatos. The cheese bread is always a winner! I love the ambiance of the place.My company often gets their catering service.The spinach tomato pizza is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Spinato's was great they got us in and out in about 35 minutes. We came in about 10 till closing and set a table up for us. Best pizza I've ever had! We had two on one pie  the super 6 and the Presto pesto chicken. Everything was delish! It's a little hidden away in an odd spot but perfect once inside. Our server was great we can't remember his name and we are sorry about that! Large pizza,family salad(yummy croutons) and 2 cannolis $45! Can't beat the price, quality of taste and service!"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the BEST pizza in all of Arizona! Staff is amazing & always so friendly. I hope they are around forever."}
{"text":"I just went here for the first time tonight with my family and had a great time.  The food was delicious, but what really sold it for me was our outstanding service.  We were helped by Maria and she was a total sweetheart!  She knew the menu very well, gave great recommendations, and made sure we had everything we needed.

As for the food, I had a gluten-free pizza and their crust was really yummy (which can sometimes be a challenge when doing things gluten-free)!  My family had a pizza, calzone, salad, and dessert, and they were all very satisfied with their selections.  

I do wish they were able to serve alcohol, but that did not ruin the dinner whatsoever.  Plenty of parking out front and this location is right down the street from Tempe Marketplace.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The cheesey bread was to die for!  I like the pizza but the sauce is a little sweeter then I'm used to so that too getting accustomed to but it was delicious.  The staff was very friendly, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. We went there for the calzone but ended up getting a salad, pizza and calzone with a red velvet ding dong. Fyi...when you order a dipping sauce for the calzone this place charges 49 cents per cup so just a heads up. It would have been nice if they had told us they charge for it when most places don't."}
{"text":"We thought we were at the wrong place when we pulled up - very industrial looking from the outside, but totally different inside.  The salads and pies were awesome.  We had the Mama Spinato's pie and the Super Six.  The Mama's Spinatos was awesome.  Our group will definitely go back.  I only wish they served beers."}
{"text":"First of all, the pizza is cut in squares because that's how you cut  thin crust Chicago style pizza!  Any self-respecting Chicago pizza connoisseur knows that.  This place is the real deal, lots of pizza choices, including a chicken pesto that was out of this world, and good looking sandwiches.  There's even a combo sandwich which is hard to find in AZ.  AND, the owner comes out and greets all his guests, just like they do it in CHI town.  Food is great, lots of locations in the valley, definitely will return!"}
{"text":"First, never would have found this place if someone had not led me here. The garlic cheese bread is the best I've had and their marinara is perfect. It's a little sweeter pizza sauce, which is my preference. But the service was even better. Our waitress (Maria?) discussed the different pizzas and answered questions for us. After she'd put our order in she came back and made a suggestion for a change. She said, \"I gotta be honest. You ord'd good pizzas, but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't make a suggestion. What da ya think about switching pizza [x] with pizza [y]. I think you'll just be happier. If I was a havin ya over ta my house, dis is what I'd a make for you\". Her suggestion was perfect...she totally knew what she was talking about and we devoured both large pizzas. One fault was that the one person in our party who ordered a salad never received it, but she ended up eating pizza with us and never felt like it was necessary to mention it (other than to make sure we weren't charged). I will absolutely be back here and bringing friends.

3/30/16: Went back for lunch yesterday as a big group again. Same waitress served us and asked what we wanted. We told her to surprise us so she picked 3 large pizzas, each one with half of one and half of another. We devoured them and loved every selection. That girl knows how to please."}
{"text":"My nephew and his girlfriend go to this location frequently and brought us in there last night for our 1st time. We were a party of 7 & were seated immediately by a super friendly hostess. The manager Tim came over to tell us our server would be right with us and he would get us drinks while we waited which I thought was great! THEN...we met Maria- She was awesome! I've been waiting tables for about 20 years and seriously....that's some of the best service I've ever had. Anyways, we tried 3 pizzas. The original cheese Sicilian, the Hawaiian and the Mamma Italia with spinach and feta etc..They were all a hit. (except for I personally didn't like the original sauce, just too sweet for me). We got the antipasto salad for the table. Tons of meats and cheeses, pepperoccinis, tomatoes, olives etc...My niece was doing her math assignment online and flagged down a young man around her age, Brad, to help her with it and he didn't even flinch, he just jumped right in to help her, (although, I think they were flirting). We tried the gelato, the chocolate chip cookies, and the apple pie crostini dessert. All very good. It was such a great experience that I'm really looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I still stand that Spinatos is my #1 pizza place.  Even now that I live in California, I can't help, but crave the sweet, garlic, and tangy pizza sauce.  Whenever I visit back to AZ, it is my go to spot every single time.  My two favorite dishes: mama's signature calzone and chicken pesto pizza. Since I am not a fan of ricotta, I order it without it in the calzone and it leaves room for more mozzarella, spinach, and sauce.  Warning, if you get the biggest calzone, I recommend it for only 4-5 people. If you are 4 very hungry folks, get the largest."}
{"text":"IF you're ever in Tempe Arizona and you're craving some pizza, THIS is the place to try. We got their version of what's considered a supreme pizza, I think it was called the super six? Not sure, but it was freaking awesome. I'm the kinda guy who likes a LOT of cheese on a pizza, and Spinato's definitely puts a lot of cheese on their pies. Just an FYI, unlike how traditional pizza's are sliced into triangular slices, Spinato's slices theirs into squares...

Also, you HAVE to try their spaghetti and meatball calzone... it sounds weird, but it was surprisingly delicious! Just make sure you get some pasta sauce on the side!"}
{"text":"I love Spinato's.  The original location is on Smith Street in an industrial area of Tempe.  

I live right down the street from the 2nd location at 12th Street and Glendale Ave.  There are several locations, but this is my fave.  Hello?!  BYOB!  What more can you say.

You bring the beer or wine and they'll give you the glasses, corkscrews, etc.  And there's not corkage.

Background:  There's a family of pizza places in the western suburbs of Chicago called Aurelio's.  Aurelio's is great!  My boyfriend is from Chicago and grew up eating Aurelio's.  Well, the from what I understand, the Spinato family worked with/for the Aurelio family and decided to come out to Phx in the 70's.  They opened an Aurelio's pizza place here in Phx.  It did well, but things transpired that I do not know about and now it's Spinato's.  

This is Chicago style pizza.  But not that deep dish business, this is Chicago style thin crust pizza, a round pizza cut into squares.  The sauce is a little sweet and they use just the right about of cheese.  I love the peppers they use -- a mixture of hot and sweet (they're not really hot).  My fave is the Super Six -- cheese, ham, pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and peppers.  I prefer it with extra cheese instead of sausage.

Their antipasto salad is simple, old school with a great Italian dressing.  

For less than $15 we can have salad, dinner and BYOB.  

I prefer to eat in for the super hot pizza."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here a few times over the last couple months and it has been consistently good, if you can find it! The exterior of this location makes it seem like Mr. Spinato is in the witness protection program or something as there is no signage. From the street I would have expected to find a medical supply store or some place that makes trailer hitches - anything besides a really great pizza shop. Now I just look for the tool company across the street. The interior of the place is inviting and comfortable in exactly the same way the exterior isn't. We have only tried the pizza here so far but it has been consistently good. We like that the sauce here is less sweet than at other Spinato's locations (or at least the bell road location) and the service has always been really friendly and quick. The place is a bit small inside so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"A friend of mine insisted that we go to Spinatos for lunch. At first I was a little hesitant because I fear people's opinions of pizza, but I figured I trusted her taste buds so off we went.

This little place is hard to \"find\". Not because it's out of site, it's just within a bunch of industrial buildings on Smith Rd. The first time we accidentally drove by it. The numbers on the building are clearly marked, so I guess that's our fault for not  being more observant. We just expected a restaurant style building.

We walked in and my friend, my boyfriend and myself were seated promptly. We ordered our drinks and looked over the menu. Note that this particular Spinatos location does not serve beer or wine like a few others. 

After reviewing the menu I settled on the feta, spinach and green  bell pepper DEEP dish pizza. I state this so boldly, because they do serve both deep dish, calzones and thin crust pizza (along with sandwiches/salads/and pasta). I'm definitely NOT a fan of \"cracker\" thin crust pizza, so this chewy delight was what I was after. My friend ordered the Spaghetti Calzone and the boyfriend went with a Sausage/Green Bell Pepper pizza. We were all very satisfied. It's #2 on my list of favorite pizza's in the valley. Nello's will always have the biggest piece of my heart.

Before hitting up this joint I read dozens of reviews trying to find out more about this sweet sauce everyone was talking about. I'm really picky about my sauces, so I almost went with a sandwich, but changed my mind in a \"what the heck\" moment. With me and sauce, I get grossed out at 'chucks' of 'stuff' in my sauce. I was presently surprised that this sauce is chunk free! No roaming grossness of slimy tomatoes. No soggy onions lurking around. If I had to explain it, it reminds me a lot of BBQ sauce. It is about the same consistency with that sweet but not too sweet under tone. My friend swears they put crack in it, and I couldn't agree more.

I will definitely be back to Spinatos in the near future. I've been thinking about it a lot since the last time we went.

I do want to say that it did take a while for our pizza to come out. Possibly next time I'll order out and pick up. But overall I'm a huge Spins fan.

I still LOVE SPINATOS!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome pizza, I'm a fan of the Olive Oil Based pizza, but the house-made marinara based pizza is pretty fantastic as well. The marinara is slightly sweet, which is why I tend to lean towards the olive oil.
The place is right off the road and a little hard to find, but worth the wait once you're in. Spinatos tends to die down after 1pm if your headed in for weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Another gem found thanks to Yelp.  I had the baked spaghetti calzone, my wife a half/half pizza. All I can say is WOW on both of them. Excellent flavor, quality ingredients, served by a most awesome waitress Maria. This is the original location and the original of anything is always the best place to go. No alcohol served, just good food by good people. Put it on your list, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Recommended by our hotel's bartender, and you know that's good advice!

Pizza toppings were fresh and tasty. Thin-ish crust, cooked to be a little crunchy with lightly browned cheese. Zesty, hearty homemade marinara sauce may be the X factor."}
{"text":"Never will you find this location, so be sure to use your GPS or print detailed directions first!  Located in an industrial center, on a side street, and non-discriminating sign to boot!

What might be saved on a less than desired 'location location location', makes up for it in both the food and service.  Great and delicious!

I've been here a couple of times on recent visits to Phoenix, and cannot yet sway for getting a pizza.  OMG - what's in this tangy sweet sauce?  it's a thinish crust that allows me (and soon you) to pound away at pieces of this delicious pie!

Bring it Spinato -- you know what you are doing!"}
{"text":"This was the cutest little pizza place. It's tucked away and kind of hard to find. The cheese bread is so good. The sauce that they use on the pizza is to die for, and I love that they cut it into squares! They sell their sauce by the jar and I would have brought some home if the weight of my suitcase allowed it."}
{"text":"Loved the combo pizza and the strawberry gorgonzola salad and service was great! Make sure you try this local pizzeria if your in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. We had a small business meeting there, and it worked great. The staff are awesome. The food is really good, from the sandwiches to the pizza to the salads."}
