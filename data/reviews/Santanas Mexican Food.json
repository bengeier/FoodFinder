{"text":"Worst place to go to ever for anything. Long story short... I came out with a fish taco & chimichanga platter & went into the bathroom with a bad stomach virus. All I'm saying is... \"Don't do it\". My baby even mentioned that a family of  flies were up there checking out the menu as well. Think Thrice!"}
{"text":"I go here for tacos sometimes when I'm in the area. The food is good and very inexpensive. The breakfast burritos are good also. The place is in the hood and a bit divey but the people are nice and it's good for a quick snack when I'm going through the area."}
{"text":"This place is a total dive but the staff is friendly and the food is great. I love how they they toast the tortilla on my carne asada. It's a regular for that burrito fix."}
{"text":"This place could offer better service. The food is not that good and their prices are through the roof. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it looked like a damn rolled taco lol."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years and have always enjoyed their chicken tacos/ tortas and chili relleno burritos! The people that work there are very nice and speak English well (a total plus for a coconut like me!)."}
