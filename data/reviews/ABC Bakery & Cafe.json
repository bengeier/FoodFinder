{"text":"Restaurant is ran by a bunch of student looking teens. Service is extremely bad. Menu is extremely limited. Server brought us chop sticks after we arrived and sat down to play game. We weren't even brought a menu. Pathetic."}
{"text":"I am a fan of ginger beef and wasn't impressed by ABC's.  Dropped by for dinner and I think there must be better in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Your typical chinese fast food restaraunt. I love their breakfast as they serve a fast meal when you're in a hurry. The menu is limited but it's very cheap for the portion size."}
{"text":"I've been a frequent return customer of ABC Bakery since I was in my teens this restaurant/bakery has been around for quite some time. For a teenager going to this place is almost like the equivalent of making Mac 'N Cheese at home.

What I'm trying to say is the portions are gigantic and the meals themselves are ridiculously cheap in my opinion. When I usually go I order my favorite dish which is the pork cutlet covered in black pepper sauce, this dish comes on a hot plate so its sizzling while you eat it, it comes with 3 big pork cutlets, soup/bun, as well as your choice of tea/coffee.

ABC Bakery is your typical Hong Kong style cafe with a great selection in their bakery section. As well, their breakfast is cheap and quick when you're on the go kind of person. I do believe this place has new ownership and the interior of the restaurant was refreshed and looks great.

Try it out when you're in Chinatown, great little place that probably not too many people know about!"}
{"text":"ABC's value is hard to beat. Especially when it comes to their lunch specials.

For $6.50, you can get a heaping dish of Ginger Beef, a large plate of steamed rice, a small bowl of soup and a good-sized \"water glass\" (the kind you remember from the cafeteria) of hot tea.
In my opinion, the portion that you get could feed TWO!

The Ginger Beef is as good as anyone else's in town. The soup is never all that memorable, but who cares??? You just got a huge meal for really cheap!

If you really want to splurge, add on a \"Sweety Strawberry\" drink for about 3 bucks more. It is like an icy goblet of pureed strawberries, spilling over the side of the old-school soda glass. Delicious.

The decor is almost diner-like and you always have the option to buy some Chinese bakery classics on your way out (or drop in just for that reason!).

This place is a \"must\" if you you are in chinatown, extremely hungry and need some good food quick."}
