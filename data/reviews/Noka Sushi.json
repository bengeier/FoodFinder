{"text":"Noka was a major disappointment. We wanted to go to Sushi on Bloor but it was busy. AYCE was $20.99, but we were not that hungry so we just ordered about 5 items off the menu, including ice cream at the end. I did not notice any bento box options which was unusual at a sushi place. I ordered sushi pizza and when it arrived, it consisted of 3 rice crackers with seaweed salad and salmon on top. I was expecting the traditional sushi pizza with actual rice as the base. It was such a cheap alternative. The service was not that great, many attempts were made to alert a server but they just kept walking by us. When the bill arrived we saw that  we had been charged gratuity. This is absolutely pathetic. I have never been charged gratuity unless it is a party over 6. I should be able to determine  how much I would like to tip based on the service I received which was extremely lousy. The bill came to $60 with the included tip, we should have just opted for the AYCE menu, would have saved $20 and had a lot more food.  NEVER GO TO NOKA!!! We should have just waited for a table at Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"No surprise that they have 2 stars. Just walked out after they refused to serve our table because not everyone was planning on getting the all you can eat option. They were also very rude about the situation. We've been to many other sushi restaurants that have all you can eat and normally my son and I get it and my wife and daughter get something off the menu because they are not big eaters. If you like rude service and only having one option of all you can eat then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Firstly, the chips at the beginning were awesome. Service was pretty damn fast and the California roll & Shrimp tempura rolls were equally awesome. Definitely somewhere to try out."}
{"text":"The food is nice, the service is so-so the only shit i can't stand is they add 12% tip in advance every time although i always tip around 12-15%, but still don't think service fee should be mandatory"}
{"text":"I ordered Sushi. The delivery was quick, the delivery person curteous, and since it's Christmas I highly overtipped.    The fish was okay but the rice based sushi were simply not fresh. There was also not even nearly enough soy sauce, especially considering that they were slightly overpriced.  I am very disappointed. Rice is cheap, not that hard to make some fresh sushi."}
{"text":"What a disaster. i had eaten at Noka before and remembered it being pricier than other spots on Bloor and of equal quality. passing by this weekend and seeing a \"$12.99 AYCE\" sign, my dining companion and I figured the deal was too good to pass up.  we headed in and waited ten minutes for a table. no big deal! once seated we promptly filled out our ayce menus. and waited. Finally i waved a server down and gave her our menu. after 15 minutes, not even our miso soup had arrived.  DISCLAIMER - i'm not an unreasonable person. for a $13 ALL you can eat experience, you tend to expect rough-around-the-edges service (which is too bad. all businesses should care about their customers, even when they're offering a deal. but in toronto, i just don't expect a good deal and good service to overlap)   time passed....every time it looked like food was coming to us, it came to the table(s) surrounding us. THEN, food started coming in high volume to the table next to us, that had arrived about 10 minutes AFTER us.  still no soup, still no salad. 25 minutes passed. soon, the waitress started coming with what looked like it was our food (ii was so hopeful!). and wasn't. she kept serving the table beside us (the table that came after us). now, though, there was a twist. she'd lower the food so that both us and our neighbour-table could see it and ask, \"did you order this?\"   are you kidding?! placing food under a bunch of strangers' noses so that they can breath on it as they suss it up and down?  we'd exchange eyes with our neighbour table who seemed equally unsure, but process of elimination made it clear that the food was certainly not ours. after this happening three times (35 minutes past, no soup or salad on our table), i declared with exasperation, \"we're leaving.\" the waitress was the opposite of apologetic. she snapped in a smarmy tone, \"okay!\"  it's also worth mentioning that on a previous visit, the waiter served my entire order to a nearby table, meaning that table had a free additional meal and i waited an extra 10 minutes. he seemed embarrassed and bashful when he realized the mistake - which is not to say that he apologized or even acknowledged it - so i let it go. but given my most recent experience, i now have to wonder what is structurally WRONG with this place?!  just, no."}
{"text":"Noka has quality sushi for a great value.  I Think they are by far the best sushi in the area and offer the freshest ingredients at a fair price.  I have been there many times and have always had a great experience and have had exceptional service."}
{"text":"Was really craving for some good sashimi and selections, and was very hungry. We checked Sushi on Bloor but was packed, so we tried this joint. There are over 180 choices, so I thought 'Bam'...Great deal! Price is $20.99 on weekday dinners, but WAIT...There's more...For 2013 Mon to Wed, its only $16.99...You read right...$16.99!!! Double Score!  That was the good news...  We all had the ayce, b/c if you didn't get that, you had to sit separate tables, which is printed in their menu as well. We started firing orders left right and center from gyoza, tofu, sweet potato, miso soup, beef soup, bacon shrimp, yakitori shrimp, maki's, sashimi, sushi...You name it, they have it...Interesting enough, they have maki's named 'Ex-Boyfriend/Ex-Girlfriend' haha  The negative about this place is that the orders took very long to come, as there was only one chef making all the orders, and had no assistance...So that I understand. Better pay the man double OT for that. I also realize they gave us all the heavy carb food at first like shrimp tempura, gyoza, sweet potato etc.,  I was eating the bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp which is good. I consumed like three of them, and then my gf was about to try one, and unwrap the bacon off the shrimp and notice that the part covered in the shrimp is still grey colour and not cooked...OOOOOOOHHHHHHHH SHHHIIITTTT...I may have a long night...in the toilet!!! I let the server know and they apologize, but no discounts for this my friend, just apology and laughter.   Finally after checking a while for the sashimi, sushi, maki's they arrived one hour plus later at which point we consumed it pretty quickly...As we were ready to not order anymore, our server tells us, 'Now is great time to order more sashimi and stuff, because Chef is more free'...Umm...Because all the customers left fast, and went to some other better sushi joint...haha  Their sashimi most of them is frozen, only their salmon is fresh as most people order this quite often. Would I come back to this joint again...Maybe because of the good price, but probably not on a busy day...  FYI: They have low salt soya which taste a lot better than regular soy..."}
{"text":"My first clue that walking into this place was a mistake, is that Chinese are running this place!  Exit !..... Fast!  Last thing I need is kidney failure!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the food was prompt and delicious. Service was ok, I have nothing bad to say about it. I wonder about the complaints.... are they expecting fine dining service? We were seated next to some girls who ordered too much and I would yell at them too for wasting food! I'm sure the staff here has seen it all. I'd be so jaded if I worked here This place is very good value with nice fresh fish and sushi. I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"If there's a half star, that's what i would give this restaurant. I dont normally go to ayce japanese, but its easter sunday and there weren't a lot of places open. O god what a bad choice!!!  Service? Girl forgot lots of our order. Ignored us for the 1st half hour til we had to flag her down to give her our order. Then, after reminding her twice that she forgot our miso and spider roll, she still forgot!!!   Food? Its ayce...what do u expect?!? But on top of the ayce, we did order spider roll. It was the worst roll ever. I couldnt even describe how disgusting it looked.   Just dont come here!!!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite shushib place! My girl and I come here religiously!  Best red tuna and salmon around,  keep it up!"}
{"text":"Not very good. Over priced for the quality and portion size- especially compared to what is available in the area. Not the greatest service and they know it: an automatic 12.5% gratuity is added"}
{"text":"Before I get into my review, I'd like to say I order sushi on a regular basis and have never been compelled to write a review until now (as I'm lazy, and pretty easygoing about food).Sushi places with a similar price point, to be clear. That being said - DO NOT GO HERE.  Delivery: The ordering process for my small order took a very, very long time. Despite speaking in a slow and clear manner, I had to repeat myself multiple times to multiple people. I get that it happens, but it took over ten minutes to order 2 specials with zero substitutions. I felt that was far too long for such a small order.  Ding Dong (except not really because I don't have a doorbell but ok): Items arrived 45min later. Delivery person didn't say anything to me, just held a white bag with food. I asked for the receipt and he didn't 'do' anything.. like respond, make eye contact, make a noise, anything.. So I tore my receipt off myself. Tipped him, I don't know why. On the phone they asked me twice about tipping the driver though. Messaging must have worked on me. Onto the food.  Receiving items: Despite going over my order multiple times, with multiple people, only 1/3 rolls were the correct ones (!!!). Because it was a special of 3 rolls for a set price, and I received cheaper, totally unrelated rolls in their place, I believe they deliberately shafted me to save money. I can't prove that, but it makes no sense to replace my rolls with ones so different which also happen to come at the lower price point. At best, they got my order completely wrong. Which is not very good at all.  Maki: To make matters worse, my rolls were small, completely loose (like, not due to being transported either..the cucumber sticking out and falling apart once touched), messy and not well-made... To the extent of not even being how they were described in the menu!! Yes, they omitted ingredient. Yes, even the easy and cheap ones they substituted my order with. What is going on tho???????  Teriyaki Chicken with Tempura: Tempura:  Soggy. Broccoli centre was cold. I spat out the shrimp after one bite. Threw it out. Can I mention I have literally have eaten COLD Chef Boyardee out of a can and enjoyed it... sober?  Teriyaki Chicken: No. Teriyaki. Sauce. Anywhere. On Teriyaki Chicken.  Got rice, plain chicken, vegetables, and no sauce on anything. Teriyaki Chicken arrived as plain, dry, cut-up chicken..I don't get it. Vegetables were tasty though...  I have not tasted the miso soup and do not plan to. Sorry, but I'm just TOO MAD  In conclusion: I'd give it zero stars if I could. It's gross, they messed up my order, and didn't even cook their own food correctly. Actually the worst delivery I ever had in Toronto. I'd call back for a refund, but I can't imagine how long I'd have to sit on the phone for that one.   TL;DR: for masochists only, literally apologized to a friend for ordering from here"}
{"text":"We initially went to sushi on Bloor (next door), but as a group of 8 during the busy lunch break - it was literally impossible to get a table and the estimated wait time was 30 minutes. As hungry as we were, we just left and decided to find another place since there are many sushi joints on Bloor street. As convenient as it was, this was next door! The service was friendly, however the wait for the food took very long and we were the only group in the restaurant. The quality of the sushi was poor as it broke apart very easily. But, they have some interesting sushi choices (mango one was an interesting try!) I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone and I don't think I'll consider coming back, unless sushi on Bloor is full again."}
{"text":"The sushi is ok, the service is less then desirable. Ordered take out twice from them First time I ordered it took an hour to receive my food. The second  time I ordered it took two hours. I called and they said it was very busy. Ok I understand, but if your running that behind pick up the phone and call your customer to let them know it's running late. Won't ordered from here again. Lots of sushi places in Toronto to choose from. This place has lost my business."}
{"text":"Food... was decent.   Atmosphere... was nice and quiet.  Service... was okay.  Except for when the server was refilling our water, he had bad B.O.   But what I was pissed about was that not only did we HAVE to give a 12% tip because they automatically set that up, but they're the kind of people that when you pay by card, they ask for your it, take it and tap your card (if you have tap) on the machine FOR YOU.  Yes the receipt shows how much we're paying but I'd like to know how much you're typing in on the debit/credit machine before my card touches it."}
{"text":"Went a couple days ago with friends and was severely disappointed. Food was mediocre and in many cases we had doubts about its freshness. However the worst part was the service. Our waitress just dropped food in front of us and was extremely rude. When we came in we immediately asked if it was alright if there was someone in our party who wasn't eating and we were told it was. When the time came to pay they charged him $15 and all he had was a glass of water. Overall I will not be coming back and I do not recommend unless they get new staff."}
{"text":"This place is dismally bad. I thought I had the worst sushi in my life when I was in Prince Albert (in northern Saskatchewan) at Sushi House. Noka may have surpassed sushi house in poor quality. While I liked the idea of pumpkin sushi, Noka's version of 'sushi pizza' is probably the worst thing I've ever made the unfortunate mistake of putting in my mouth (I was hooked in by the idea of it including seaweed salad...). The salmon was horrible, incredibly fatty and just generally poor quality  In short, you probably shouldn't eat here"}
{"text":"This place has been my mainstay for probably two years, now.  I lived on Bloor at Brunswick, and had my pick of innumerable sushi restaurants in the Annex, but I went to Noka almost all of the time.  (Sushi on Bloor sushi pizza Cannot. Be. Beat.)  The all you can eat at Noka is a great deal - my friends and I go there often for it.  They also offer a 2 rolls for/ 3 rolls for/ 4 rolls for deal that I've used a lot for takeout/delivery.  While I am not a sushi gourmet, I have had some bad sushi in my life.  None of it has come from Noka.  A few times I've noticed the consistency of the food slipped, but we're talking maybe 5 times out of 100 (quite probably).  I've found their tempura crispy, dumplings also crispy and tasty.  My absolute favourites are the spicy salmon roll, sweet potato tempura roll, and beef tempura roll.  That said, when my friends and I go for the AYCE, we order all sorts of stuff, and there's only been a few rolls I didn't enjoy (and that was my own taste).  Sometimes when large groups are in there, it can be loud.  So if there's a large group, don't go.  While sometimes the service is uninspired, I've never had a negative experience here.  I've never had a problem with takeout orders, and delivery has been fine, too.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"I can only give it 2 stars because I luckily stopped my order as I noticed the plethora of negative reviews and frozen fish being taken out of the freezer. The staff were dishonest; when I asked if the fish was frozen they said \"no fresh frozen\". The 2 stars is because the only thing I ended up ordering, an Asahi, was quite cold, even if requesting a glass seemed overly burdensome to my food attendant."}
{"text":"No sushi for you!  My son wanted to go to the restaurant next door for his birthday, but it was closed because they were moving, so we decided to go to Noka. The decor was nice. It was loud, so we had a hard time hearing each other.   With 2 teens and a preteen, we ordered a lot of food. The cooked food came out quickly, but then we saw a waitress wandering around carrying around a bowl of edamame. Hey, we had ordered edamame and ours hadn't come yet. The waitress tried to deliver it to a couple of other tables, they didn't want it. I waved at her as she passed by our table, but she didn't even look at us. We never got our edamame. We didn't get most of the sushi or the udon we had ordered either. An hour after we had been seated, someone started to clear our table, including my daughter's medication. After I complained that we were still waiting for our food, they brought out 7 pieces of the sushi we had ordered. After 2 hours of waiting, and still not getting several dishes we had ordered, we asked for the bill and left. Three of the four of us were still hungry as most of our food never arrived.   They bill themselves as \"all you can eat\", but in reality, it's \"all we decide that you can have\"."}
{"text":"I came here last weekend with a group of friends and we were very disappointed. The service was terrible, the waitresses gave us a lot of attitude and was very rude. We got the AYCE option. Although the sushi was pretty good, they had way too much rice in them. A lot of our orders were never brought to our table including our miso soup that we asked multiple times. All AYCE are billed with a 12% gratuity which I did not think the servers deserved. I would not return as there are many other better AYCE sushi restaurants on Bloor st."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi! Teriyaki items are exceptionally good. Soups are also great. All of the food was fresh and hot! This place will be our go to sushi in the Annex.   Ambiance is OK and the service is great."}
{"text":"i've never been to the location so i can't say anything about cleaniness but i always order from here because they're the first ones to come up on just-eat when you search by ratings. the reason i always order from here is because they're one of the few restaurants that offer brown rice instead of white and i try to be healthy, lol"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on a Friday night when both Sushi on Bloor and New Generation (my usual favs) were quoting me a 20-25 min wait. Overall, the food is good. Service could be a lot better. They offer a buffet at dinner for $20.99, which is a pretty decent price for a Friday night. I ordered a-la-carte though and got their Sushi combo A and a spicy salmon roll. The salad was was unremarkable and bland, they really skimped out on the dressing. The fish could have been fresher. Spicy salmon roll was decent, nothing special. My friend and I ordered the same thing but they messed up our order and gave him something completely different, Also, our dishes did not come with wasabi, and when we asked our waitress for some, she brought us less than a tablespoon full and we ended up having to wave her down again to ask her for some more. We ordered tea but it never came. Even after we paid our bill, they kept bringing us food (which was meant for other tables and we told two waitresses that they got the wrong table).  I'm giving the food a 3.5, but overall this place gets a 3 because the service was poor and disorganized. Ok dinner spot if you are looking for average sushi."}
{"text":"Don't understand these low reviews to be honest. For AYCE, this is miles better than Sakura. The side dishes aren't that great but the rolls are great quality for AYCE. Don't expect a 5-star service but for their lunch AYCE but the place is my go-to for AYCE when it's a cheat day."}
{"text":"I think these guys are going broke. As someone with celiac disease, I would go here for their gluten-free soy sauce. Today they told me that it would cost an extra dollar for both my friend and I to have this \"special\" sauce. I can buy a whole bottle for $4. I spoke to the manager and she said, \"Well, if you don't want to pay for it then you can just use the regular soy sauce.\" -- right -- because that works for someone with a severe allergy. Then they delivered one bowl with wasabi and ginger...so I'm guessing money's tight?   I wonder if they're cutting corners in other ways...won't be going back here. There are a million better sushi places -- I'll just bring my own packages of gluten free soy sauce!  Bye bye Noka!"}
{"text":"The food isn't too bad.  Here's the thing - you pay for what you get, and this place is SUPER cheap.  If you're not fussy and not a connoisseur, you're going to be fine.  That being said, if you go in with expectations, you're probably not going to be happy.  The food is decent, but not great.  Oh lord, but the service is seriously some of the worst I've ever had.  They brought the wrong food to us about 10 times in one sitting, the waitresses wouldn't even turn to look at you when you talked to them, and a couple were downright surly.  Legitimately some of the worst service ever, but something tells me they're probably not getting paid well enough to want to bother.  I'd go again, but mostly because the food is so cheap (and so am I, apparently)."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars, I would.   Please don't come here. Terrible food, AND service (forgot order, rude talking) , and the 12% gratuity PER PERSON on the bills. They should be ashamed.   Stay away!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here mid afternoon and waited just over an hour for it to arrive. The delivery man was rude.   That aside the food is good. Salmon sushi is fresh and tasty, the avocado is all fresh and ripe and flavourful. The miso soup had a few bits of mushroom that were less than appealing but it was all fine.  The oyakodon is good, though nothing special though it did arrive warm and fresh. Overall good, though wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"have enough space for all of us so we were all tightly fitted in the corner. A few people had ordered already, while the rest of us (4 people) had to wait 15 minutes for a menu, we were then told the 4 people who had not ordered could not order until the sushi the others ordered were all eaten. The sushi was fresh, it didnt have that old stale taste to it. However, the chefs make certain items differently than other sushi places I've been to, such as the salmon pizza ( a deep fried corn chip with spicy mayo and garnish on top); which wasn't a big hit for my table. The waitress was very rude, when asked to put the sushi plates in the middle of the table so everyone can have some, a dirty look was given and the plate was put on top the far corner of the table. Also, there was a mix up with the orders, thinking we had ordered a shrimp tempura and not a hand roll, we were made to pay $5 per shrimp tempura hand roll as no one wanted them, in which totaled to an extra $20 on top of the all you can eat price. All in all, WILL NOT be coming back to Noka. At least not until the service is more customer friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst. Went in on a Sunday just to try out different restaurants on Bloor as I'm new to the area. Me and my dad have gone to hundreds of AYCE Japanese places and this is no doubt the worst. We came in at 8pm, left at 10pm and we only ordered 1 sheet of paper because instead of focusing on the patrons in the restaurant they were too preoccupied with their deliveries. So as we waited 15-20 minutes for each dish, we watched as a delivery guy would run out of the restaurants holding 10 bags of food. Similarly everyone else at the restaurant was complaining at the service. Finally to top it off after the worst service of them constantly apologizing that they lost our order or saying \"its on its way\".. they had the nerve to charge us for gratuity as per their policy! Insane to think people actually go there considering they're directly beside the best sushi resto on bloor...Sushi on Bloor."}
{"text":"Terrible delivery. 25 minutes late and over an hour wait!  miso soup: cold and flavourless chicken teriyaki: cold and flavourless, runny watery teriyaki sauce fried udon noodles: cold,bland, runny watery sauce spicy tuna rolls: looked like cheap pink chopped tuna the only redeeming feature was the cucumber avocado roll. how sad.  i will never order delivery from here again."}
{"text":"My friend and I occasionally crave all you can eat sushi (I know a lot of places are bad quality, but sometimes we just want a lot of food)  Noka seemed to have interesting rolls (e.g. ex-boyfriend roll) so we decided to give this place a try  None of the food was fresh and we were not happy with anything that we ordered, pretty much. I've been to much much much better all you can eat sushi joints, and I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"If I can give zero stars, I TOTALLY WOULD! Worst service, food and they try to scam the customers money by adding items to your bill which we didn't even eat. Came here with a friend and there was only 3 tables inside the small restaurant.   Worst sushi in toronto!! Worst sushi I had ever tasted in my life !  SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE! The female server was absolutely unprofessional and the food came extremely slow. When we asked her what is good on the menu, she doesn't know the menu at all.  When the food arrived, the appearance looked good but tasted like garbage. It was so gross that me and my friend had stomach pain for 2 days afterwards. Probably due to the poor quality and old fish they use here.  When it was time to pay, we asked for our bill and the server charged us for 3 AYCE for 2 people. I don't understand how that's a mistake because don't you check the bill and the correct table before you hand them to the customer?!?  At this point we called the bald server over and he was confused as well. Eventually they admit that they had made a mistake and overcharged us. Forced to pay 12% tip also for atrocious service and making us pay for 3 AYCE when there's only 2 people.  This restaurant is probably running by using cheap fish and also scamming customers who don't check their bills. Also, as someone who knows many people in the restaurant business, it's ILLEGAL to add auto gratuity to bills when the table has less than 6 people.  Disgusting service, and food. Ruined my day and had stomach pain from their food for 2 days following dining here.  Avoid dining here and save your self for sushi that is edible else where !"}
{"text":"Sushi was decent, although I did second guess the quality of the Yellowtail.  The service was horrible. Our waiter essentially tossed the plates and wasabi bowls on the table and took off while I was in the middle of asking him a question. Our mains came before our appetizers and after a half hour we had to ask where our appies were a 3rd time. Such a frustrating dining experience.  ~ In response to the owner's question, I do not recall the server's name. It was late afternoon September 1st, 2014 and the server was male and fairly tall."}
{"text":"Noka sushi on Bloor is the worst sushi I've ever had in my life excepting sushi purchased from a drug store. Rubbery, slimy, grainy sashimi, some of it still had ice on it. Gummy, stale rice, even the seaweed salad tasted wrong somehow, not a single dish was good except the miso. It was a challenged to eat not because we were full but because it was all just awful. The only edible food was just deep fried and bland but at least it wasn't screaming \"possible food poisoning\" at me like their fish selection and it certainly wasn't worth the $85 they charged us for 2 adults and a 4 year old had 2 pieces of tempura, a few bites of chicken teriyaki and a scoop of ice cream which they charged us almost $15 for. They added a 12% tip to the meal on top of prompting us to tip again when paying. Service was more or less ok but the food was awful and it was almost $90 for 2 people (plus one domestic beer at $7.50 and a 4 year old who literally had 4 bites of food). As if all this wasn't enough we witnesses a fellow diner be pressured until he paid $20 for sashimi he found as sub bar (if not gross) as we did and scanning other reviews I see this seems to be a common occurrence there. I have never until this day encountered a bone in sashimi before and I'll close with that.  AVOID."}
{"text":"There isn't a lot of sushi raging outside salmon. Great for the price if you want limited AYCE and want to crush a lot of food for a low buck. order heavy on the steak teriyaki and you are doing well."}
{"text":"I was dining here alone (it's a personal preference sometimes. Take your pity elsewhere), on a not so busy Friday evening. I ordered sushi combo A (7 pieces of sushi, a California roll, miso soup, and salad) and a tea. The order came quickly. The roll and some of the sushi pieces were a bit loose, but the fish was tasty. There was shrimp, red snapper, red and white tuna, as well as salmon (my favourite).   The food was satisfactory by my standards but the bill was bit sad. The combo itself wasn't a crazy price (perhaps a touch too expensive), but what turned me off was the 50 cent (go shawty) charge for the tea and the automatically included 12% gratuity.  If you're going to automatically include the tip at least respect your employees enough to give them a solid 15!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten on this strip of Bloor in years and was completely taken by surprise by the number of Japanese restaurants.  It turned out to be a coin toss as to which one we chose and with hunger having a good grip on us we chose Noka since it had seats available.  Now I know why.  Aside from getting prompt service when taking our order I had to flag down servers for anything else.  The roll we ordered (Noka Spicy Salmon) was a mushed up salmon mix piped on top of a lackluster roll of rice, pollack (the fake crab) cucumber and I can't remember what else.  Way too much rice in the roll for my liking, and not much for flavour at all, even when eating only the \"spicy\" salmon topping.  It was hard to tell if the salmon was fresh, though I'd bet it was old, hence making it a mixture.  The fish slices on the sushi were dwarfed by the massive rice boat it sat upon.  I was not partaking in the All You Can Eat menu so was perplexed as to why they'd still serve it this way.  I ended up slicing half of the rice off, and there was still plenty left to serve as a bed for my fish.  In my 20+ years of eating sushi this is the first time I have ever had to pick a bone out of my mouth.  This pretty much wrapped it up for me on ever coming back to this place, or recommending it to anyone.  The icing on the cake though was the surprise 12% gratuity added to the bill.  Of course, as businesses who don't care about repeat customers tend to do, they calculated the gratuity after taxes.  Tips are always based on the price of the meal, basing a tip with the taxes added is like saying you're grateful for the tax... which I don't think anyone is.  The result is my tip was over 13.5%, and - of course - the bigger the bill, the larger the tip percentage will be.  Don't let that 12% fool you.  Now I'm not a cheapskate when it comes to tipping and usually tip above what their mandatory tip is, but I object to being told I must pay a gratuity for bad service and low end kitchen staff.  Also we were a party of 2.  If we were a party of 6 or more that would be a different story.  In the end kids I'd say take 20 steps in either direction of Noka, or cross the street. Just take your business to any one of the dozen other Japanese and sushi restaurants in that 3 block strip.  You really couldn't do much worse."}
{"text":"Solid variety of ayce items, and it all tastes great! Good Wednesday discount, too."}
{"text":"So I met restaurant owner Chef Lin of Noka at Kampai the exciting and tasty sake sampling held by the Sake Institute of Ontario.  We got to talking and I decided to stop by and try his food.  I really enjoyed the dishes but it was the chef's passion that stood out to me.  He opened his restaurant in the Annex.  More accurately he opened the restaurant directly beside Sushi on Bloor...oh no!  Now if you know The Annex area, you will know that it is pretty much all sushi, coffee and FroYo establishments.  This was of concern to me as a marketer, so as usual I asked questions about what makes them unique, what value they offered to the \"young asian student\" that dominates the area's demographic.  They had great answers to the questions, like being a chef run sushi restaurant which many are not.  Like buying product fresh from farmers markets, sourcing interesting fish like Bonito and in keeping with \"chef run,\" making almost everything from scratch.  This was of interest to me so I thought I'd see what others thought about the food, the prices and the atmosphere.  So I invited people from the Toronto food scene to check out Noka and provide feedback.  So what was the consensus?  Attendees really appreciated the Chef's creativity and passion, including a demonstration of how to make a simple yet tasty house salad dressing.  It was felt that with a few adjustments that the restaurant had potential.  This was demonstrated by some killer home run dishes like the lamb chop.  I provided the owners the feedback and like a true restaurant professional they listened to their customers and made adjustments.  If you check their twitter feed you will see wonderful bright red tuna, lightly seared fish and many daily treats.  I can't wait to try the seared bonito myself and the other daily specials.  The pictures below are from my solo visit as well as from the event.  Easily one of my favorite dishes.  Silken tofu with king mushroom and house teriyaki sauce.  I love silken tofu and this was a great dish boasting a cool tofu and a warm sauce.  Lamb chop cooked perfectly with a killer chili basil sauce.  One of my favorites for sure.  A simple sashimi provided to sample the house made soy.  Any Japanese restaurant worth their soy (salt?), either makes their own soy or adapts existing soy to their liking.  Good chef will temper with bonito, kombu, dashi and many other things to get to a wonderfully elevated soy.  Noka's soy is mild and has a hint of sweetness.  It is a definite improvement from stock soy.  Nice thick and juicy slices of salmon to again sample to the house soy.  The maki trio was beautifully presented and had clever names.  I rarely order maki but this was part of the tasting so I got to sample it.  Stuffed Tuna Roll had tuna, spicy scallop and leek, the Ex-Girlfriend Roll had mango, tuna, asparagus, and avocado and the Vegetarian Delight Roll had avocado, beets, mango, papaya and asparagus.  The spicy leek roll was ok but was not spicy and the other two rolls were what I expected from the description.  Another version of the killer silken tofu with mushrooms.  Such a nice dish.  A beautifully presented dish that was my least favorite of the night.  First they used real amebi or fresh shrimp and then fried them.  They are amazing as sashimi and would of loved to had them served that way.  Also, the green puree was bland.  The highlight though was the frying of the shrimp heads.  If you have not tried you must.  They are eaten whole like soft shell crab and are simply lightly salted.  I love me some fried shrimp heads.  I rarely enjoy desert at Japanese restaurants and this one was in line.  If you like deserts like mochi and red bean, you may enjoy this.  It is not my cup of tea.  To recap I will be back to eat some of the fresh fish specials for sure.  Let me know what you thought of Noka."}
{"text":"Their lunch special is not as great as other sushi places around. I like the variety though (like the fashion roll).  As other reviewers have mentioned, fish quality is not as good. Don't know if I can expect good quality fish for the price point but it is higher in price than other ones around as well."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with my boyfriend when we were both craving sushi. The experience was so terrible that I don't even know where to begin with this review... 1. Terrible service. After being seated (the server simply pointed to our seat without even a greeting) we were neglected for most of our meal. Service was extremely slow and they even forgot to bring out some items we ordered. They also neglected to refill our water, take additional food orders, or bring out the bills when we had finished. 2. Quality of the food was the worst I've ever had. The pork gyoza and spring rolls were very greasy (all you could taste was grease, nothing else). Taking a bite of the grilled eggplant was like eating oily mush. The sushi and maki rolls were warm and mushy. It definitely was not fresh. The avocado they used looked like it was going rotten. (Also note: there is a warning on the menu that some food items may not be fully cooked and could lead to illness. If that doesn't ruin your appetite then I don't know what will). Every bite was torture but we had to finish everything to avoid being charged for leftover food. 3. The strict rules seemed insulting/rude and really put us off the food. It was really not worth the hassle. Needless to say this place has put us both off sushi for a while."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what explains the negative sentiment around Noka (the service, I suspect?) but for takeout this is a more than decent option. FREE DELIVERY ON DOOR DASH! (for now, at least). I've tried the veggie dragon roll, the yam avocado roll, the shrimp tempura roll and the green dragon roll. It was definitely among the tastier variety of sushi I've had in the city at this price range (for 25ish pieces I paid about $25, all-in). The chicken yaki tori is also pretty good, but maybe not the best pick if you don't enjoy the taste of soy sauce in chicken - otherwise, tasty! The door dash menu is quite extensive so I'd imagine the dine-in options are equally plentiful. The delivery is fast in the financial district (~40 mins) so I imagine I may come back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for all you can eat dinner on a Saturday night. the menu look really good so we were excited to try this new place. We had very poor customer service at this place. We had to remind our waitress several times about the items we ordered. The appetizers came before our miso soups and salads. Our drinks came long after that.  I asked another waitress what was on the table as I couldn't recognized what was brought to us, she didn't even look went to get somebody else. No communication with the customer, we were treated in a very poor way. The worst was at the end. I was brought fried rice which I didn't order. A 3rd waiter came and brought me back our order and show me that I had made a mistake and order the fried rice. I wanted to ask him if he could exchange it but he didn't give me the chance, immediately he said: this is what you ordered there is nothing I can do... I couldn't eat it anymore. We won't go back to that place, you guys lost 2 sushi fans... and we do eat out all the time!"}
{"text":"1 To 10  -food is 7 , time To wait for the food 1, I tried all you can eat for dinner, many items were missed, second request took more than 25 minutes to arrive  , some arrived after we had already paid the bill lol."}
{"text":"This joint offers tasty sushi for tremendous value.   I generally go to Noka once or twice a month for lunch. If you order one of the lunch specials the nice thing is that they allow you to mix and match the types of sushi you wish to order. Most places typically do not let you do this.  If you are hungry you mind as well go all in for the bargain price of $13 for the all you can each menu. Some of the appetizers, like gyoza are not great, but everything else from the seaweed salad to the tempura veg to the sashimi to the many special rolls, like the Rainbow roll, are fantastic. The mango avocado roll is also pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had in my life. Not only was there at least three times more rice (size-wise) than there should normally be for sushi, but the rice is super densely packed that it's almost like mochi. Gross. Have they never had real sushi before? I have to wonder, because I could barely taste the vinegar in the rice either. Super bland rice super bland fish. But the horrible \"service\" really topped it off. Very rude and even condescending. Oh and they include mandatory tip in their bill, despite not giving any friendly service that would be worth it. I guess they don't have to work for tip so they don't even bother anymore. Don't waste your money or time and go to any of the other multitude of sushi joints in the annex area. I don't even want to give them one star."}
{"text":"I don't do reviews and I went through the trouble of making this account and writing a review so that I could express how much I was disappointed. This meal was very disappointing. My partner and I ordered the crazy spicy salmon rolls and the crazy spicy butter fish rolls. Some of the rolls didn't have fish in them and they were not spicy.  We did not get all of the food we ordered. The service was below average.  The mango pudding tastes absolutely terrible. My partner, who eats everything, couldn't bring himself to eat it. We also overheard another customer complain about it.  The only thing I enjoyed was the salmon pizza, banana tempura and the vanilla ice cream.  I will never come here again. And I would not recommend this place to another person. It's not worth my money."}
{"text":"New politics for this AYCE: don't serve all what the customers asked for, pretend you forgot half of the ítems, let them wait 30 min, don't pass throuhg their table, and hope they'll get desperate and leave whitout complaints.  The same thing happened for two of the tables beside us... No wonder why all the other AYCE sushi places had long  line ups. I should've waited to get satisficed and not rushed into here to get upset."}
{"text":"Food was very good! Some of the other reviews on here are quite dissapointing..but I can honestly say I enjoyed my time here. Sure. The sushi had extra rice on it but it's a buffet place. Not a fancy Japanese restaurant. There are rude waiters here(heard from others) But I haven't ran into any during my visit. My waiter was nice and had a decent  conversation with me. You have to ask for water and my waiter seemed a bit amateurish. Beware though. The food on the all you can eat list looks small. But portions are huge! So order lightly because you pay for what you don't finish. Which sounds dreary but makes sense waste wise on their part. Was very satisfied and felt like it was worth the 14.68 or so."}
{"text":"Ordered through Just Eat. Delivery  took an hour and a half. The miso soup was cold. Also pretty bland. However, the salmon sushi was amazing and super fresh. Would love to try dining in at the restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"5 we ordered take out and let me tell u... the quality and cut of the sushi was incredible.  actually better than most sushi places.  tge place is not cheap but defunTely the quLity was there in all yhe take out food we ordered.  really impressed and completely satisfied.  also service on the phone was pleasent."}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars because of my friend who loves this place. I would have rated this 1 star like many others. The food is not bad, but the service has improved, from horrible to acceptable. Therefore I generally say: 3 stars; A-OK.   The service was ridiculously bad, borderline insulting, when I went a few months ago. Bad service destroys my appetite. So I vowed not to go again.   But my friend doesn't give a damn. He can still enjoy the okay food under any circumstance. Anyway, I joined this friend again recently because I still like sushi. Surprisingly, the service actually wasn't that bad this time. They didn't screw up the order much, didn't threaten us to be careful how much we order, and didn't treat us like crap. Huge improvement, but still it's pretty obvious the manager doesn't care about service. If he/she did, then I think this place can reach 4 stars easily. ---- Update: Went there this week. Editing rating to 1 star. Yea, there's still that tall asian dude working there that treats you like dirt. Other servers are polite, but it only takes one rude server to ruin the experience.   So I'm really not going there again."}
{"text":"Really craved sushi last night, walked to Sushi Couture first, they didn't have much options if you don't like fish aka moi   Food arrived quickly! Music playing in the background was dance pop which kindof ruined the dinner setting. I didn't really wanna hear that party rock song by lmfao while eating LOL.   We ordered 2 Ms. Toronto, 1 Spicy Crab and 1 Angry Dragon roll along with 2 Yaki Udon.   Prices/info  $12 Ms Toronto roll - shrimp, crab meat, avocado, mango and cream cheese.  $11 Angry Dragon roll - spicy crab, shrimp tempura and papaya  $4.50 Spicy Crab roll - spicy crab meat and tempura bits. $9 Yaki Udon is pan fried noodles with chicken, mixed veggies served with miso soup, salad and complimentary ice cream.   Keep in mind this is a contemporary sushi restaurant, some rolls come in rice paper/soybean instead of seaweed. Makes it more mushy tasting then crunchy which I didn't like( ms Toronto roll is rolled like this) Restaurant has vegetarian options along with gluten free items too. The food is very filling, dont order more then one entree like us. Rolls we got were pretty large in size except Spicy Crab. Total bill was a few dollars below $70. I would come here again to give other contemp. rolls a try!"}
{"text":"We went here because everything else was closed at 11:45am.   The cooked items were ok. The agedashi tofu and karaage is just normal fried tofu and chicken. Super limited options on their lunch menu- ex. They didn't have shrimp tempura which is pretty standard.   Owner was talking on the phone loudly in an unpleasant way the whole time and the waitress wasn't very responsive.   They make the maki and nigiri gigantic with way too much rice so that you get full faster. Normally at another AYCE sushi place we could order a lot but here we only did one small round because the pieces were so ridiculously big. We had to take out over 50% of the rice but they wouldn't give us more sushi unless we ate it all which was impossible. Just paid and left- won't be going back."}
{"text":"Either low grade or out of date tuna left me sick for two days. Would never go back. This place is priced mid tier but the quality is very low. There are many other options nearby that you should try before you venture this place."}
{"text":"As a patron of *almost* every sushi establishment on the Bloor Spadina to Bathurst strip, I had to try Noka.  The street seems to alternate between Fro Yo, Sushi and Coffee Shop now nearly exclusively.  I've been both earlier in the day and later night, both times the service was excellent and at night it was absolutely cheerful, with some lively music and smiling server.    To drink I ordered Toronto's own Sake Izumi Genshu (http://ontariosake.com/products/) and it was served in the neat little wooden box where it's poured overflowing the glass in to the box.  To start we ordered the Hot Sake Stone, where beef is cooked on a sizzling rock rectangle; you use a fat cube to grease it up and the beef cooks quickly for dipping in to two sauces.  I opted for the gluten-free teriyaki sauce which was fantastic.  The most memorable and well executed item we had on the menu was the lamb; the portions were better than a similar restaurant would deliver and it was tender and cooked just right, placed on top of a delicious sauce.  I would order the lamb again and again.  The Ex-Girlfriend roll was interesting with it's mango wrap and strawberry sauce drizzle, a bit girly for me but still done very well.  They have an Ex-Boyfriend version as well that was mentioned as a special.    The Happy Hour menu was in effect for our late night dining and the house wine at $3 a glass is a steal.  The simpler rolls are a value at around $2.50-5.00  Noka first showed up in my social media stream with a menu controversy; I'm a big fan of doing what's right and copying the menu of another place doesn't fit that but the website has been modified.    It's not quite an icon like nearby Guu but I think it beats most of the rest of the street by a long shot with its better interior, food and service.  They're just in soft opening now and already pretty darn good, so I look forward to seeing Noka get even better!"}
{"text":"The salmon in the salmon teriyaki that I ordered tasted all right. However, I wasn't too pleased with the side vegetables that came with it - they had a weird bitter taste to them, almost like a chemical taste.   I wasn't very pleased with one of the servers either. When I asked for their wifi password, she lied to my face and told me that they didn't have wifi! When I pointed out that they do, in fact, have wifi, she smirked and told me, \"I don't know the password\". Girl, I know you have the password. You could've just told me that the wifi was for employee usage only instead of lying to your customer! That same server was also rude to one of her coworkers. She was criticizing her coworker in a very loud voice, upsetting the nearby customers.   The only reasons why I didn't give Noka a 1 star is because of the reasonable prices, the fact that their service was very quick (I was in a rush and they were able to get my order in quickly) and because my server (the one who was being criticized) was very courteous and polite."}
{"text":"First, the good: - Vegetarian/ Vegan options : excellent selection  - Food was excellent! miso soup, tempura, and veggie rolls!   Ok now the bad: - TERRIBLE SERVICE - automatically included 12% tip with no prior warning and service was terrible  - rude  - didn't not check back often or refill waters, etc   going back today to have AYCE so will update review after giving them a second chance!"}
{"text":"The service is \"worst\" in Toronto. I don't wanna go no more. So disappointed. Quality of here is 3/5. However, amount of rice in sushi is more than 1.5 times than another restaurant. I didn't care before waiter warned us. He said if you remain the rice one more, no dishes for next time. What...? They don't know how to say politely. Why don't you guys reduce the rice? They are not deserve to get automatically included 12% tip. It was first time to get angry after eating in Toronto.  P.S When you enter the restaurant, you may wait 5 min even there is only 2 teams in. Waiter is missing.  And watch out, server doesn't like question and lunch last call is not 4:30, \"real time\" is 4.  ."}
{"text":"We ate here at lunch time, even though there are lots of other sushi places we thought we'd try it because of it's variety.    Worst time ever !!! They didn't finish our order, I had to request/ remind them for our food.  The rolls were thick ie. Too much rice.   Our neighbour was pychotic, I don't have anything against real pychosis, but it makes for an interesting lunch."}
{"text":"I was very honoured to have been invited for a tasting meal at NOKA and didn't want to pass up this opportunity for a night of creative presentation, japanese cuisine and any other surprises along the way.   On the menu were 8 different dishes showcasing hot and cold, seafood and meat in addition to original dishes, homemade sauces and demonstrations. Watching the chef make their in house salad dressing, I was surprised at the # of ngredients put into it... however, no diary products which was a positive. I must say that the taste of it was very similar to other dressings I've had at other restaurants. Next was the soy sauce taste test. We were offered 3- regular store bought, low sodium soy, and their in house soy. I'm  a fan of low sodium and the verdict  still stands. Their homemade soy sauce was too sour for me, with more vinegar than the norm. This came with the first course - 3 pieces of fatty juicy sashimi - cut beautifully presented in a little wooden box, with a dollop of in house wasabi. Every bite tasted fresh and I could taste the horseradish in my mouth with a good amount of heat. This was off to a great start.  2nd dish - Green Ocean: Deep friend sweet shrimp on a bed of fava bean and yogurt puree, with edible flower. I didn't understand how the dish came to be and after tasting it, I was still scratching my head. The fava bean tasted mushy with no flavour and did not compliment the shrimp. The flower added a spark of colour in the presentation but did not add anything to my tastebuds. I felt like it was an attempt to make you feel healthy with a deep fried component.   3rd dish - Threesome consisting of the following rolls: Stuffed Tuna - tuna, spicy scallop, leek. My thoughts on this roll, was extremely bland and dry, wanting soy sauce, and no spiciness whatsoever. There was leek in it? Didn't even notice. Ex-Girlfriend: Mango, Tuna, Asparagus, Avocado. It was OKAY, with the drizzle of strawberry sauce, it was a sweet roll. Vegetarian Delight: Avocado, beets, mango, papaya, asparagus. I liked the beet chip that was on top to add crunch to the roll, but once again, the strawberry drizzle really should not have been included because it once again became too sweet. I actually thought the papaya was mango and flavours did not show through.  4th dish: Al-Tofu - oyster and white mushrooms, teriyaki sauce and dill. I thought that this dish was going to be hot but at first bite, it was cold / cool in temperature so the teriyaki sauce was not elevated. The dill was extremely overpowering and not needed - it was a major turnoff. If they had used Enoki mushrooms - it may have added some more textures and variety.  5th - Basil Lamb Chop - baby lamb, eggplant and basil chili sauce. I really liked the baby eggplants because it helped with the extremely overpowering basil chili sauce. I could dip my lamb because there was a taste that resembled licorise but the chili spice was not pleasant, while the lamb, which looked to be cooked well was rather tough to chew.  6th - Bacon dish with two components. Buta pork belly on pureed carrot, with pickled cucumber. Maybe the cucumber was in the puree but I didn't see it. The pork belly was cooked and seasoned nicely and the carrot had no flavour whatsoever so it was a failed attempt to balance strong and simple flavours. Creamy Bacon Roll - which was a deep fried roll with bacon, avocado, whipped cream and what seemed to be shaved smartie bits for colour. All I tasted was a deep fried puff. The inside which I broke open had a piece of avocado and the smallest piece of bacon fat. This just left me a little clueless.  7th  - Noka Chilean Sea Bass - with magno, miso and elderberry sauce. I was so excited to try this dish and I must say it was pretty tasty, at the the expense of the oil it was soaked in. The fish had a nice charr and grilled very nicely. The flavours did come through but sadly, I was wiping the fish on the lotus leaf it was sitting on as the oil dripped out. The sauce was not necessary as it was way to sweet and took away the simplicity of this beautiful fish.  8th - Mochi, Sorbet: Red Bean Rice cake, Strawberry and chocolate mint. Anyone who knows me knows I love Red Bean so I had high hopes. Sadly, something was missing...I don't know how to explain it but the mochi was bland, with what seemed to be red bean paste out of a can. The strawberry sorbet was too soft, and tasted like strawberry jam. The mint was missing the chocolate component.. I was asking others and we wondered if the chocolate was infused? Still not sure.  The dishes I found most tasty can be found at other restaurants so I don't feel like I would make a trek just for salmon and bass. I can only give an honest based on what was plated and am sad to give this a one star at an outing full of great people and conversation. With so much competition on the street, I think that there is a bit of work to do. I feel that NOKA is trying to hard to be too inventive - stick with your strengths."}
{"text":"AYCE dinner is $21.99 before tax and tips! There is a mandatory 12% tip that is included in your bill.   The menu a great variety of iteams including desserts (deep fried ice cream and deep fried bananas were my favs!).   Try the bacon wrapped shrimps if you come here- don't think I've tried this elsewhere THEY ARE AMAZING! Teriyaki dishes are nice too. The Korean ribs are just okay.   The sushi are fresh, sashimi are good sizes and I love the creativity in the rolls.   They didn't forget our orders or miss any item, so I'm impressed.   Overall the service is EXCELLENT! Our server Amanda was very friendly and attentive. Would come again soon!"}
{"text":"Menu: http://www.nokatoronto.com/userfiles/files/dinein2015.pdf (This is the a la carte menu, we had the all you can eat dinner so not all the items on this menu were available.)  What we had: shrimp skewers, beef short ribs, fried chicken wings, fried chicken pieces (karaage), green onion rolled in beef, shrimp tempura, calamari tempura, various sashimi (salmon, salmon belly, butterfish, snapper), unagi (eel) sushi, \"the bomb\" roll, eel and avocado roll, fried ice cream dessert, various flavours of ice cream.  Taste: 7/10  To Noka's credit, their food tastes pretty good... if it arrives. Out of the appetizers, the shrimp skewers, short ribs, and the fried chicken were good. Our friends liked the green onion rolled in beef. The tempura, like most tempura you get at AYCE sushi, has a layer of batter twice as thick as the thing wrapped inside. You'd think \"wow, they used a giant piece of shrimp/calamari/etc!\" but then you bite into it and it's all batter. :(  The sashimi was a little hit and miss. Not all of the pieces were fresh. Most of our group liked the butterfish, and salmon is pretty much a staple. The salmon belly was really fatty and tender (not many AYCE places have this), Laura loved it but not everyone liked how fatty it was. Steven loves unagi so their unagi sushi was a hit for him. The bomb roll was drenched in various sauces and the sauces probably accounted for half of the calories in that roll, but it was delicious; over the course of the meal we ordered 3 bomb rolls amongst 7 of us. The eel and avocado roll was lacklustre in comparison.   The fried ice cream dessert a scoop of green tea ice cream inside a layer of banana bread coated with tempura batter. It was good and super filling. We also had various flavours of ice cream (green tea, red bean, mango) and they're pretty much the same as every AYCE sushi place.   Value: 9/10  Each person's cost is about $20+automatically included gratuity for AYCE dinner and they include salmon belly and unagi on the menu... that's pretty good for a downtown location. After tax this is probably around $25 per person. We don't like the idea of automatically included gratuity so we're not giving 10/10 for value.   Service/Convenience: 0.5/10  You are probably reading this review and seeing that we gave decently high ratings for taste and value, but why only 2 stars? Because the service here is terrible. 0.5 because the place was fairly easy to locate and at least the servers took our order papers.  We had a group of 7 so we ordered a lot and it was probably not easy to cater to us. That I understand, but even the pair sitting at a table next to us had to wait so long for their order that they eventually just gave up, paid, complained, and left.   Most of the first round (appetizer, sashimi, and 2 rolls) came fairly quickly. After that, we waited about 40 min for our next orders to arrive. We ordered unagi sushi in our first order and it did not come until the very end after we reminded the servers 3-4 times. (We were there for almost 2 hours. We can play the waiting game.) We had to keep reminding them about our orders.   Well, I guess now we know why the 12% gratuity is mandatory.   Would go back? No, not worth the headache.  Would recommend to friend? Probably not, unless if they are really, really patient and have a good memory for what they ordered.  Similar places: Pretty much any AYCE sushi place, though as of now we do not know of any others that serve salmon belly in their AYCE menu."}
{"text":"In short: Average sushi, poor waiter service. I won't go back, especially when there are 5 other sushi restaurants within 100 metres.  We went for an all-you-can-eat sushi dinner in a group of 10. When we submitted our first order, a handful of items came quickly, but from then on things got slower and slower. As we finished the food on the table, we were waiting for half of that order to come in, and were planning our second order already.  Before the second order, we asked a waitress if our pending items were coming. Actually it often took a while to flag down a staff; it seems like the place was understaffed for the weekend dinner hour. She confirmed that some of our items were not on the chef's queue and said it was okay to re-order them. (We wanted to avoid over-ordering because we'd be charged for any unconsumed food.)  The event host in my group was growing impatient and frustrated with the slow wait service as well as the disappearing orders. We also heard a waitress say similar things at the table of strangers beside us, about how their order wasn't on the queue and they should re-order stuff. I think the pinnacle of complaints were expressed when we were wondering how long it takes to scoop and serve ice cream; it was well over 10 minutes to our surprise.  With all the waiting, we were worried about the 90-minute all-you-can-eat time limit the staff told us at the start. But it seems they were nice enough to not enforce that rule and we went to 150 minutes without a problem. (Regardless of time, we ordered about the same amount of food as we would have at any other AYCE sushi restaurant.)  Other observations: The washrooms downstairs have a low ceiling of 185 to 190 cm, something I'd never seen elsewhere (normal ceilings are at least 240 cm). Throughout our dinner time, we saw people enter the restaurant to pick up big take-out orders (like 8 boxes stuff). I wondered if the restaurant couldn't keep up with the customer workload. The (approx) three waitresses we interacted with were neither rude nor helpful, but it was hard to call their attention in the first place and they showed an indifferent attitude to us.  At the end when it came time to pay the bill, I specifically paid a cash amount that should have produced $15 in change. But the waitress missed one of my coins and gave me back $14; I pointed it out and she gave me $15 without a fuss. (I rechecked the table and floor for loose change to make sure I wasn't making a false accusation.) I acknowledge that people make honest mistakes sometimes, and I expect a cash handling error rate of 1 in 30 or maybe 1 in 100, but they picked a pretty bad time to make a mistake (whether honest or not) because I was already collecting data for writing this Yelp review.  In fairness I could say that the food tasted okay, was fresh enough, and no one got sick. By no means am I a whiner - in my other reviews I gave 4 stars over 80% of the time, and rarely do I complain about stuff. I gave this place the benefit of the doubt for an occasional problem, but there were just too many problems to not notice. Buyer beware, skip the drama that goes on at Noka Sushi."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here and I like the appearance. My waitress was very but the chef staff was very rude."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant experience of my life. My sister and I had gone in and we were given extremely rude service from the beginning. We proceeded to order food and after the first round the server a female very rudely informed us that we would be charged for left over rice that my sister had taken off the sushi because it was too thick. We are glad to adhere by the rules of AYCE but the manner in which we were told was humiliating and degrading to say the least. After asking to speak to the manager a group of males approached us from the back room when one of the proceeded to physically threaten my sister. He came close to her as if he was going to hurt her. I quickly asked for the bill and left before the situation escalated into something worse. I have never been treated like this and I am shocked that this kind of thing happens at this place. If you want to save yourself the humiliation please avoid this place! They are rude and don't know how to operate a customer orientated business."}
{"text":"This was one of those places that because we were hungry and walking by we decided to give it a shot. The place itself looks pretty nice and the waitress was quick to give water and menus. I don't have really much else to say about my experience here other then the miso soup was not hot and my sweet potato roll had little to no flavour at all. Sadly, this was one of the most lackluster sushi experiences me and my girlfriend have ever had (I realize I don't eat real sushi). On top of my lackluster food, my girlfriend managed to find a small piece of plastic inside of her roll, how did that happen? Who even knows. I would not recommend coming here, especially in an area with a plethora of options."}
{"text":"This place used to be my favourite sushi place until the other day when I went for lunch with my boyfriend and a friend.  They removed a lot of items from their AYCE menu.  I like going for AYCE at Noka because they had a variety of choices but their menu is a lot smaller now.   The service was crap.  The waitress only had 2 tables (ours and another table of 2). She gave us a table for 2 but didn't bring us extra plates, chopsticks, napkins for the third person. I had to ask! I had to ask for water refills. We didn't get wasabi and pickled ginger.   We had to ask for that too.  We had to ask for things that should've automatically been done.  Our plates were piling up and took her forever to come around to pick it up because she was chit chatting instead of working and would stop by our table every 5+ mins.   They had an ok vegetarian option. Would like to see a few more on there.  We were so disappointed in the service, we didn't tip her well.  What disappointed us the most was the service would've been good if she was on top of things because she ONLY had 2 tables.  We're not going back there again.   Although, if you're going for sushi from regular menu, it's worth it because they pack on the rice but not worth it if you're doing AYCE."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving AYCE, and came here for lunch on a weekday. For lunch it was under $15.  The quality was ok, nothing spectacular. Service was very fast.    For lunch, you can order from a list of 3 rolls for $10.95.   If you pay with cash, you get 10% off your meal.   Otherwise, I would only recommend it if you're hungry and don't mind subpar sushi."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.  There are a ton of good sushi places along this strip of Bloor (it's right beside Sushi On Bloor, so I'm sure they're hoping for some spill-over from that mainstay).  I ordered the lunch special of 3 rolls.  The miso soup that was included was really good, and the salad was just ok.  The 3 rolls were Spicy Salmon, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Himachi Jalapeno.  All three were decent, but a tad bland.  They were also a good size.  The side of Wasabi at this place was nice and strong, which sometimes isn't the case at a lot of restaurants.  The service was friendly and efficient, but the food took forever to come!  I was one of only 3 tables in the restaurant (which was mostly empty), and it took 25 minutes to get my rolls.  Not sure if the sushi chef is a newbie, or just takes his time.  The decor is much nicer than your average sushi place in the annex.  Also, instead of playing top 40 or something like that, they instead play muzak, which is a nice change (though the type of muzak didn't really fit with a Japanese place).    All in all, a good little place, especially for the price (my combo was about $10 after tax!!!).  Hopefully they can make the rolls a little less bland, and next time I'll try only two rolls, as three was quite a bit for lunch."}
{"text":"I went here on a first date back in early December, 2013. Bad idea.  There was no wasabi or ginger served to us, the fish had an off taste, too much rice on the sushi, and the beef did not have the texture of beef. Made me question whether it was cat, dog, or even human. I've never had that texture of meat in my mouth before. So creepy.  Needless to say, neither him nor I returned to this \"restaurant\". We both left with upset stomachs, but at least we had a bonding experience.  How romantic."}
{"text":"Being a big sushi connoisseur I even know personally how to make great sushi rice. This place doesn't, they add way too much vinegar makes every roll taste the same! Also, the tempura (pumpkin tempura rolls for example) tastes like it was made days ago, stale and very hard, I even put the rollin my mouth and went to the washroom to spit it out, it was that bad.   Please, fix your tempura and don't use soo much vinegar in your rice!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin.....  I have probably been to over 30 sushi places but none has been as terrible as Noka.  First of all it took us very long to get seated, the restaurant was almost empty and there were plenty of seats in clear view. Once we got seated, our food didn't come until 45 min and out main courses came before our appetizers. We asked them when out food is coming but they were very rude about it. I'd expect people working as servers to have at least decent customer service.   I am never coming back here ever again, I've actually never encounter such a horrid sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"Buyer beware:  you may or may not receive your order and will not get a refund.  I ordered $50.00 worth of sushi from this restaurant the other day and when it did not arrive, the restaurant refused to issue a refund and deferred me to \"just eat\" to deal with the problem. They insisted it had arrived and would not help rectify the problem.  \"Just eat\" could not get them to refund the money and I was left having spent $50.00 and wasting over and hour of my time.  There are plenty of sushi places in Toronto that have excellent customer service.  Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I feel as if it is my civil duty to warn everyone about their customer service. On my second trip to this restaurant, my table was yelled at by a waiter who did not even serve us. This happened after we ate our dessert and I asked for the bill. This staff member literally started yelling about wasting food and ordering too much. First of all, it was half a plate of (overcooked) chicken katsu, 2 pieces of spicy fried chicken, 3 pieces of sushi (half a roll), and a spring roll, so it wasn't as if we left an absurd amount of food. I hate food waste and this obviously was not intentional. If he had felt so strongly about food waste, he could have asked us to bring the leftovers home or HE SHOULD NOT WORK IN AN AYCE BUSINESS. We weren't even refusing to pay an extra charge or anything. He honestly suddenly came up to our table to yell at us. I felt as if I was being scolded by a parent and it took everything in me not to say \"Yes, dad\" so I settled for \"Yes, sir\" in a rather sarcastic tone. He ranted incessantly and annoyingly and would have continued had my friend and I not interceded.   Never have I felt so HARASSED, HUMILIATED, and UNCOMFORTABLE in a restaurant. I understand that people think \"bad customer service\" means that the food takes forever to come or that it doesn't come at all but I strongly believe that this was the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. At no point at all should you ever yell at a customer, especially if they have never personally provoked you. You never bite the hand which feeds you. It was absolutely RUDE and UNPROFESSIONAL.   Needless to say, I am never returning to this place and I will not hesitate to tell everyone else not to go. I voiced my opinion out loud after he left my table that I was not going to return and that I would much rather go to Sakura since they don't yell at customers and it's closer to UofT (which is where I study). My friends and I love ayce sushi and we love the annex but this tyrant ruined this place for me indefinitely. Our real waitress felt terrible about the exchange and kept thanking us for coming. I obviously did not tip because I don't want anything to go to that son of a bitch; however, our waitress was a lovely person so my friend went back after we left to personally tip her for her service.  Edit on March 24: I wrote on their facebook page regarding this matter and they have deleted my post."}
{"text":"I have been all over the city and tried sushi from a number of different restaurants. The only one I have come back to over and over again is Noka. Not only is it a great deal, but I crave this restaurant. The fish is so fresh. The service is so fast and friendly. The food from the kitchen is awesome.  Some of my favorites are the Ika Yaki and the grilled mackerel from the kitchen. Any of the sashimi's are great, it just depends on your taste preferences when it comes to fish. My favorite rolls are the unique to Toronto ones like Ms. Toronto, a roll made with crab meat, cream cheese, mango, avocado, shrimp, wrapped in a pink soybean paper. I also love the black dragon, a variation of the green dragon with eel on top. The bomb is an excellent roll of you like it spicy! The hand rolls are large and filling so make sure you don't stuff yourself full of the awesome rolls of you're getting a hand roll. Let's not forget the dessert! Give the mango pudding a try. It's more a jello than a pudding but it is worth it. And of course, if you aren't feeling adventurous, stick to the regular sushi desserts like green tea or red bean ice cream.   All in all, come to Noka, and I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a few times and I'm yet to be disappointed. Delivery times are good, portions are decent and taste is on point too.    The only thing I found a bit off was the sushi pizza.  I've never seen it served on a fried wonton with seaweed salad before. Taste good enough that I ordered it a second time."}
{"text":"I came one night past 10pm. Sushi on Bloor was closed so I decided to try this establishment out. What a mistake! I order Salmon Lover ($9 before tax) and the quantity was so little. It is definitely the smallest roll I have ever had at any sushi restaurant. It probably weighed little more than 100g. The taste is just no different from any other place but you get so little bang for your buck. Do not come here, you are better off somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the diversity of rolls for AYCE here. As a vegetarian, I get easily bored of having the same 3 or 4 rolls over and over at AYCE places, so it was really great to see how many different rolls they had. Also, I liked how they had some unusual things like sushi pizza and pumpkin tempura. Something else I really appreciate is how late their lunch lasts for AYCE, until 4pm if I remember correctly - great for late risers like me!  I have a few qualms though. They tend to overstuff their rolls with rice. Additionally, my meat eating friends have told me that the fish isn't of great quality. Furthermore, the service can be a bit slow, and they're REALLY strict on their policy about charging for leftovers.  That said, Noka is still a favourite of mine when I'm in the Annex if I want something unique to sate my sushi craving (or if I just woke up too late for lunch elsewhere)."}
{"text":"OMG. Where do I even start with this place? There were so many things wrong with my dinner tonight. I am actually writing this review while still in the restaurant just so I don't forget the numerous culinary horrors that I have succumbed to. Well that...and I am doing this to actually avoid eating more food in hopes that my boyfriend would eventually make rest of the food disappear. OK....enough romance, here are the problems:  1. Misleading menu descriptions: I ordered some chicken fried rice because I love the buttery taste of hibachi style fried rice and the menu promised that it was going to be a small bowl.  What arrived was a mountaneous plate of MSG fried rice.  It was like booking Kate Moss for a fashion show and getting Rosie O'Donnell.  2. Sashimi was warm and poorly cut.  There was actually a small piece bone that was still attached to the salmon belly (which is \"salmon toro\" on the menu - something like this is really insulting to customers' intelligence).   3.  All grill items were overcooked and smothered in the same sauce.  The grilled mackerel was especially terrible; something was definitely not right over here.  The texture of the fish was hard as a rock as if it had been semi-prepared ahead of time and had dried out.  I don't want to spew out cliches like  \"it tasted like cardboard\", but there hasn't been an instance that this simile has been truer. Another dish that proved challenging to my teeth was the negi beef roll.  The green onion used inside the roll was so tough and would not give in no matter how hard I chewed.  I felt like one of those animated cows in a Disney movie that's always chewing disenchantedly before something suddenly happens to which it reacts by widening it eyes.  The only difference is that nothing exciting ever happened to me during this meal.  4. Everything was just kind of stale.  I'm not going to make the a list but this statement is not an exaggeration.  5. This is a little off topic but the music was really off-putting.  I felt like I was in a Chinese rave bar.  I understand that restaurants like to use fast music to get customers to eat faster thus increasing the turnover rate.  However, seeing how the other Japanese restaurants in the area had long waits and Noka was barely half-full despite the the cheap promotional AYCE price, they should try to make the guests stay longer just so it is not obvious that they are getting crushed by the competition.  All and all we could not finish the food and we were charged for our leftover which we did not even protest to.  This is food that we would pay just to avoid eating it.  I am a seasoned forayer in the world of AYCE sushi and I can say that I have never been charged for over-ordering before. So either I got too excited this time or the quality and quantity ratio was tragically mis-proportioned.    *On a side note I must say kudos to whoever manages their Facebook account because it makes Noka seem like a place that tries.  After my visit tonight, the only way this restaurant is trying is deliberately sabotaging itself.  I did not come with high expectations and they were not even met half-way."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  typical sushi joint. We waited for a bit, until  i just sat down somewhere; entourage followed of course.  clean place. Getting to the bathroom i had crouch the whole way; very low ceilings. Is that even city hall bylaw whatever safe? No signs that say \"watch your step/head\".  I learned that the hard way.  Food was decent, nothing like Vancity sushi. But okay for Toronto I guess.  Sashimi is great, the salmon is obviously farmed fish. But hey, better than no salmon. Tempura is alright. I love the house salad.    Service is limited to plopping down dishes on the edge of the table.  Whatever, just bring me my sashimi.  There was one thing that really pissed me off. When you get your bill, it has what you ate, tax, and also 12% tip that sums up your grand total.  That really pissed me off. Do I not get to decide how much tip I want to leave behind? They don't even tell you it is in there. So who knows how many ppl add extra tip on top of what they force you to pay.   Anyways, probably not coming back. Didn't absolutely love it."}
{"text":"I never do reviews... I made this account just to say their food at this restaurant is EXTREMELY disappointing. Not only is this place dingy looking but their customer service is poor!! I ordered a chicken tempera, spicy salmon roll, salmon hand roll and a shrimp tempera roll. The chicken tempera tasted under-seasoned, the spicy salmon was messy, the seaweed of the hand roll tasted stale with way too much rice and the shrimp tempera roll was absolutely sad.   Also.. When I informed the waitress (Anna) that I didn't enjoy the food she bragged and said \"well.. we are very popular\". How unprofessional is that?.. Not even an apology! DO NOT go there.. There's other sushi restaurants around!"}
{"text":"Don't go here!  I've gone here several times over the past two years and this will be my last visit. They raised the lunch AYCE from $11.99 to $12.99 which wasn't a big deal but they also started charging $2.00 for their sashimi during lunch which use to be included with the base price.   We decided to not have the The rice and salmon ratio on their sushi was absolutely pathetic. My friend and I had to cut a third of the rice off in order to even have any taste of the salmon.  When asking for the bill, they tried to charged us $2.00+ each for leaving some of the rice behind because we \"only ate the salmon\" bits. When explaining to the server that we only took off a bit of the rice so that the sushi would even be edible, he had the audacity to question how my mother raised me which was definitely not necessary.  The server then offered to void the charge if we eat whatever was left.   I don't know what happened to this place but their sushi is a mess and the servers only care about trying to cheap you out and make you full off rice.  Very disappointed, avoid this place!"}
{"text":"My usual (Sushi on Bloor) was lined up out the door so I decided to head into Noka to try lunch as it's right next door.  Place is nicely decorated and is much more relaxing than the hustle and bustle of next door. Service was very good with several attentive waitresses at hand.  They have a decent selection of lunch combos. $5.99 for a choice of 2 rolls (there are 12-15 to chose from) or you can get 3 rolls for $8.59.   I opted for the sushi and sashimi lunch, which was 8 pieces of sashimi along with a california roll for $9.95.   Food was all quite nice. Sashimi was fresh. California roll wasn't anything too exciting but it was standard.   I would probably come back again if the queue at Sushi on Bloor is ridiculous. It's probably a better place to sit and chat with friends as it's much calmer and quiet."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. It's good for Just Eat though. Even then, if they forget your order they will not give you any discount."}
{"text":"They used rotten avocado in my rolls and claimed it was fresh. Even if it was \"fresh\" why use a brown avocado at a restaurant?"}
{"text":"Noka.. a new Japanese restaurant just doing a soft opening in the Annex.  Service a little spotty... There was no wait for tables but I feel a little rushed and cannot really enjoy my dinner...   The price though is good... really good... but with all these competition around including Sushi on Bloor right next door and Sushi Couture just across the street and a few more in walking distance.. competition is going to be harsh!  Sushi Combo ($9) is amazing value... 5 pieces of sushi and a California roll with soup and salad and that's dinner pricing!!   - Salad dressing is Meh, funny mango taste...? - complimentary potato chips is a nice touch - The nigri sushi is good... but notice no wasabi inside...  - California Roll has sauce on top.. I guess it is one of those fusion twist?  Free Edamame if you check in on Yelp App (YAY!!)  There is something just missing from Noka... I hope they can figure that out before their Grand Opening!"}
{"text":"We wondered into this place because we were hungry and wanted sushi. So many sushi restaurants around us and this is the one we went into.  To start of, the decor was nice and the menu had a lot of great things!  I ordered the Noka spicy salmon roll and a miso soup. I wasn't starving so I went with a small meal. The miso soup was good, can't really mess that up. My sushi arrived. It looked yummy, however the taste was less so. The rolls were so big and tempura fried that is was nearly impossible to eat in one bite as sushi is intended to eat. The salmon was warm? Which was weird. I ended up just scraping the salmon off the top because it was not enjoyable. There wasn't much of a taste, everything was really bland. The weirdest part was I found a piece of plastic in my sushi-after I ate it and fished it out of my mouth. Didn't love that too much.  Anyways, I most likely will never come back seeing how many other amazing sushi places there are and this one is not great."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery through Orderit.ca. my order was:  1 The Bomb Roll  add soup and salad 2 5 Pcs. Sushi  1 9 Pcs. Sashimi  1 Shrimp and Veggie Tempura Dinner Combo   Delivery took an hour and 20 minutes.   The tempura was soft, and had a floury taste.   The fish used in the sushi and sashimi tasted old, and fishy. We ended up throwing most of it out.   I'll never risk ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Ugh, I don't understand why some people do service based jobs when they clearly don't care. We have been ordering from here since it opened and it was generally ok in terms of consistency. But tonight we had an experience so poorly handled that we are taking our business elsewhere.  We put in our usual order via Just Eat, as we never have had an issue with them. But after 90 minutes our meal still hadn't shown up, and when we got ahold of the manager - we called twice - he was so completely indifferent (despite aknowledging that we are regulars) that we ended up refusing the order (I had already started cooking something out of desperation). He didn't apologize, but tried to blame the driver and placate us with a free order of the cheapest appetizer they have. It was downright insulting. And short sighted, considering the number of sushi joints in the city.  So, bottom line: avoid like a Nickelback tour. It's in your best interest."}
{"text":"This is the worst ayce sushi in toronto. Its a rip off! The bald guy waiter is unfriendly and on the rush to give our bill and dont even bother to fill our cups with water. Food is not good if you want a decent ayce sushi buffet go to sakura garden in avenue road. I rate this place -5"}
{"text":"Avoid this place at all cost unless you don't mind paying the 12% mandatory gratuity!  Boyfriend and I were being adventurous, instead of going to our usual AYCE sushi joint, we went to try something new, came home completely disappointed and furious.  I would give 3 stars for their food quality despite the sushi rice was a bit sour than other sushi places. Shame, I liked how fresh their salmon sashimis were. The restaurant gives out a weird vibe, we felt pressured enjoying our food there, it felt like you were constantly being watched and judged because the waitresses were so worried if you are going to waste the food. At a point, they refused to serve us food we ordered because they think we will not be able to finish, hmm excuse me? They did not check back often to refill waters, you can hear someone kept shouting at the kitchen as well. Horrible service.  We ignored the fact with them judging our appetite but what made me mad was the 12% mandatory gratuity! We ended up spending $70+ for 2 person AYCE, imagine you walked into the restaurant with a budget you want to spend in mind, turned out the bill is way more than that! With that amount paid, we would go to a better Japanese restaurant that serves high-quality ala carte."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi delivery place. It always comes in a timely manor, the sushi tastes great, and the portion size is fantastic. I have  never been to the actual restaurant so I cant comment on their customer service, but I have never had any problem with any of my deliveries."}
{"text":"Everything in the business owner reply is completely made up by the owner.  Nothing in his reply actually happened.  I will never go to Noka because I don't respect lying business owners."}
{"text":"We ordered about 100$ worth of sushi from this place. The tuna tasted like it had gone bad and was minced to cover the taste. Called the restaurant to let them know and they couldn't of cared less. Never ordering from here again and you shouldn't either."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but people need to know NOT to come here... Really hungry so walked in without looking at reviews and that's absolutely my bad... not that I was expecting good quality sushi but even for AYCE standard this was horrendous.  Soooooooooo much rice in the sushi and rolls.  Salmon was super cheap salmon (obviously not sushi graded).  Mackerel was really really fishy.  Automatic 12% service fee for bad service.  :)"}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is the actual way I feel.  Food was okay. The salmon sashimi was cut quite small and thin compared to other places I've been to. The miso soup was awful and really bland. The other food items just met expectations. If you want a decent place to eat sushi, then this place is right for you. Don't come in with very high expectations.   TIP - 10% discount if you pay cash. BEWARE of the 12% automatic tip on the bill."}
