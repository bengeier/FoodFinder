{"text":"I have no idea how these guys produce consistently ripe plantain day in day out. Other than that their chicken, rice and eggs are prepared with home made care, and provides exactly what i need when I want something satisfying and light. The service is excellent and they play the fine balance between attentive service and allowing me to enjoy my food in silence perfectly. I have spots wherever I go in Canada; and this is a definite must."}
{"text":"Excellent Peruvian food with good portions.  The chicken was soft and the dipping sauces were all tasty.  They have their own style chicken noodle soup which was delicious.  The service was top notch and the restaurant was very clean.  Definitely a place I would return to."}
{"text":"As a child of a Peruvian, with plenty of experience with the cuisine, I can testify that the food is authentically spiced and flavored. I had the anti-cuchos and chicken and yuca, and all of them made me think of Lima. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, service and prices! Was pretty hungry going in, got a quarter chicken with sunshine rice and I was full when I left. The spices on the chicken are delicious! On top of it my meal was only 11 bucks! Definitely be back one day."}
{"text":"Wow, I stumbled into this gem after work looking for a quick bite. I'm not familiar with Peruvian food, but the chicken and Tamal I had here was unreal. Spiced well and tender. Would recommend this !"}
{"text":"Just went for lunch today and tried Pio for the first time. I loved it! I had one of the lunch specials, the Pio con Quinoa, which consisted of 1/4 chicken with quinoa salad and included a choice of beverage (Jugo de Maracuya, Chicha Morada or pop) for $12 incl GST. The rotisserie chicken was so succulent and flavourful. The quinoa salad was amazing too. For a drink I had the Jugo de Maracuya which is basically passion fruit juice. 

My coworkers loved it too. They all raved about how well-seasoned and juicy the rotisserie chicken was. 

Very well-priced and good quality food."}
{"text":"Very tasty and inviting restaurant! I had the aji de gallina, which was creamy and savory, though not at all spicy (as I had requested). My boyfriend got the ceviche and was very happy. We shared the anticuchos, which was my first time eating beef heart! That ended up being my favorite, tasting like a much fancier cut of beef and particularly tasty with the dipping sauce."}
{"text":"The chicken is AMAZING!  Deliciously seasoned and we'll cooked.  This place is a hidden gem and is definitely worth a stop.  The side choices and different sauces allow you try try something new each visit."}
{"text":"I've been to Pio several times and can't get enough, the food is always amazing and the service is great. I've had the rotisserie chicken and it is always juicy and delicious, the platains are as good as any I had in Latin America. The Lomo Saltado is my favorite dish, yum. The prices are really great too"}
{"text":"Probably my favourite restaurant in town. If you are into latin food this is the best place to go in Calgary. I have tried everything in the menu for the last 2-3 years and the pio chicken qtr with platano frito is superb. Add the sunshine rice and your meal is complete. Servers are friendly and the price is right!"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this little restaurant while we stopped over by the airport - we were an English family of 6. Nice chicken, really friendly proprietor - just ask about his video of the cliff houses in Peru..."}
{"text":"The food is good and well made, but it seems to be the food we so at home. Nothing special and the portions are too small for the price you pay. For a heart need we paid $10 for a really small pieces if meat. For the same price I had a chicken with cassava, I mean a quite small chicken with 6-7 cassavas. Better you not be hungry or make sure you get an appetizer to avoid leaving the place hungry."}
{"text":"Pio is amazing chicken. It puts all other rotisserie chicken places to shame. First it's family run and run well. Very inviting and friendly staff. Food quality is amazing chicken is cooked perfectly and the spices they use and sauces are great. They appear to make their own fries which are large and also top quality. I have eaten here twice and had consistent service quality and amazing meals. Don't over look this place it is great"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write this review. I went in wanting rotisserie chicken but I was swayed by my server to order one of her two suggestions of \"real Peruvian\" food. I went with the Peruvian curry (not the name but I'm pretty sure it is the only curry on there). I was underwhelmed as it was bland, gloppy and not warm enough. Boo.

However, the people around me who did get the rotisserie chicken....their food looked divine. So I will revisit and get what I planned to order to begin with and report back."}
{"text":"This is definitely Peruvian food as I had it when I visiting the family in Lima. 
We had the anticuchos, ceviche, and both chicha morada and maracuya to start. 
For lunch there is all the favourites. Chicharones, lomo saltado, tallarines verdes, you know all the ones we have at home. 
Then there's their namesake. Rotisserie Chicken. It so much reminds me of Pardos Chicken. It is not exactly the same, but so close, so close. 
This is now one of our places to go when we come to Calgary."}
{"text":"I've had an obsession with Peruvian food ever since my friend (whose parents are from Peru) introduced me to it in New York. Every time I google image search Lomo Saltada, I salivate just a little bit. Ok, I lied, I salivate a lot. This is why I was so excited to try out Pio when my friend said he'd go with me.

We both started with the Chicha Morada, a drink made out of corn. Now before you start your chorus of ewwws, hear me out. It's mixed with pineapple and lime juice and while it may be different than juice that you're used to, its quite tasty and not as boring as drinking a pop. So give it a shot.

We ordered appetizers with the intention to share, he got the spicy ceviche (a must, since Peru is where ceviche originated) and I got the Papa a la Huancaina. I love Papa a la Huancaina because of the yellow sauce the potatoes are served with. I don't even know what it is or what's in it, but this sauce is heaven. It's right up there with hollandaise and lizano salsa. The ceviche was delicious and fresh tasting. Nowhere near having ceviche on a beach, but pretty delicious for landlocked Calgary.

Now for my main. Since I've had Peruvian before, I wanted to try something different. I ordered the Pio con Quinoa (at the server's suggestion - she said it was delicious). And it was. The rotisserie chicken came with a quinoa salad with a slice of avocado on top. Everything was super flavorful and delish.

Well, since I'd already started the ball rolling, why stop it now? I ordered the Picarones for dessert because I have a huge girl boner for donuts. The sweet potato was an interesting but satisfying flavor, and the syrup was the icing on the cake. Or the syrup on the donuts. Whatever. Don't judge me.

All in all, the food was yummy, the service was great/fast and I would go again. 4 tres leches out of 5. Because they ran out of tres leches and I was sad."}
{"text":"Very good chicken. And the little pepper sauces that they give you are absolutely amazing. Staff are quite friendly. Will definitely stop in when I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new roasted chicken place!  This place is amazing.  So authentic and inviting.  The restaurant is incredibly charming and the staff is very attentive.  They are happy to provide suggestions which isn't hard in this restaurant.  The plantains are delicious, the chicken is crispy and not dry, the salad with house dressing is lovely.  The beets were a nice surprise.  I came to visit 2 days in a row, I couldn't get enough.  I quite enjoyed the tangy civeche and was able to eat it without sharing.  The sunshine rice is cooked to perfection.  If you want to try cassava fries they are so good too.  All the sauces are special and I would say my favorite is the yellow,  it's kind of got this creamy cheesy peppery taste, my kids loved the white sauce and the mint green sauce is good to have a change.  I love spice the red sauce brings.  Truly it is a hard decision.  I would recommend if there are 2 of you get 2 of each flavour and mix and match.  Also, save room for dessert again - another tough decision.  Go with the Alfajores.  The cookie is unique and so special.   I really liked the Tres leches cake as well, but that's easy to get anywhere!  Such a great experience!  Oh yes, their sangria is amazing as well!!!  I will be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is fantastic. We went here on a whim because it was close by. The other reviews are accurate: Pio is clean and colourful, the staff is super, and the food is outstanding. We raved about it with every bite. Even though we don't find ourselves in the northeast very often, we will make the trip to return to Pio."}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 stars because food is good but I believe the prices are too high. At the end it's a rather casual place service BBQ chicken so $18 is steep"}
{"text":"3.5 star.
This is my first time trying Peruvian cuisine and the experience was good. 

The yuca frites (cassava fries) for $4 came in a single serving and was served with Huancaina Pio yellow sauce. Taste better than regular fries!

I ordered lomo saltado which is a beef stiry fry with garlic rice and fries on the side. I thought the fries do not belong with the dish and I ignored it after already devouring the cassava fries from my appetizer. The beef stir fry was flavourful and the beef juice was amazing on rice.

Generous portions and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I am adding Peruvian on my list of fave foods as of today!
Cute little place, no frills, maybe a dozen or so tables. We had to wait at the front door to get a table at 330pm on a Sat afternoon but there was no way the smell of that food was going to send me back out the door. YUM!
Do not come here if you are in a rush. I am not sure if the Peruvians work on a Mexican-styled schedule but you will wait for a server and for your food. When you get both, you will hopefully be as happy as we were! The server was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu.
We had the Plantains and the feta cheese as an appy to share, ridiculously good. I appreciate when someone else preps the plantains as they are a pain to peel and cut even at their ripest.
I had the chicken with sunshine rice. The rice is seasoned, has a yellowy tinge to it - it was exactly what I was hoping it to be - simple, Peruvian and tasty. The chicken was really good on its own, but I added a 99 cents hot sauce to my order and that made it even better. Hubby had the chicken too (you get a leg cut but you can have a half chicken for another $5 or so) and he had the fried yucca. Man, you would never know these were not french fries and how much healthier they are for you than potatoes! 
2 dips come with the chicken meal, both mild including a unique black mint sauce and a mayo sauce. 
We were too full for dessert as this was just a lunch stop but there were about 4 offerings that looked really good. Tres Leches was our wedding cake some years ago, so we will be back to try their version for sure.
I found myself comparing this place to Nando's that I have also tried recently. What I liked about Nando's was that it was larger, the hot sauce is on the table (free) and the chicken was just a wee bit better. A smidge.
Pio has table service though and I love that, no ordering at the counter but we did pay our bill at the counter.
We will for sure be back, maybe to do take-out. There was a lot of that going out the door!
Very casual, very kid-friendly."}
{"text":"I would have loved to have written a review but.......................
A colleague and I walked in to Pio at 8:40 pm eager to get some chicken but were turned away and told that they were only doing take out orders and could not sit down and enjoy a meal.  We even said we would order a lot of food and we would be great customers but, they were more interested in cleaning up and going home.
We were both dressed in our work clothes, suits and even a tie, and did not look questionable in any way that should have triggered the refusal to be served.  
Closing time was posted as 9:00 pm but apparently it is 8:30 pm and not 9:00 as posted on the door and on line."}
{"text":"Pio is one of my most favorite go to place for comfort food. Whether its for lunch or dinner they always have their food right. As soon as you walk in everyone welcomes their customer with biggest smile saying Hola.!! This place is cute, simple and nicely set up. We love their moist and perfectly cooked Rotisserie chicken with sunshine rice. Other dishes I have tried were :  pasta, seafood dish, paella etc. They all have been super tasty. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves chicken or nice cozy friendly food place."}
{"text":"Think Swiss Chalet, but with better chicken, more flavourful sauce options, and a wider variety of sides.

The mainstay of the menu is quarter and half chicken dinners with choice of side including both standard (fries, spiced rice, or house salad) and more adventurous (cassava fries, fried plantains are some examples) choices.

In addition to the above, you get a choice of sauces that fall into four categories: green (herby), red (spicy), white (creamy) and yellow (savory). Come with a group and you can get a sampler of all sauces.

I tried a dark meat quarter chicken dinner with cassava fries. The chicken was juicy and spiced enough that it was great on its own. The cassava fries were like a sweeter, woodier potato wedge. It acted as an excellent vehicle for the provided sauces.

The portions are nicely sized so that you aren't leaving hungry nor bursting at the seems. 

If you find yourself in the Sunridge area, stop by Pio for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Two words. Best chicken! Amazing!! We drive from
Far south just to eat there! So fresh! Delicious side dishes and friendly staff! Best chicken in yyc!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place for lunch ..checked out ?yelp and voila a diamond. Sorry I did not have any friends with me to share it with. I will next time this weekend for Mothers day specials ( Going to make a special Ceviche). Make reservations I was told. Great Food made with love is what they advertise and it measures up.. to the rafters. I know I? just had a bowl of soup on a cool rainy day before hitting the gym. I attached the picture. Chicken soup from scratch? had it with Quinoa?. It was like a kinder surprise?. Big pieces of chicken, a small potato, 1/2 an egg, and a special hot sauce made from scratch with a pepper from Peru (Roco) I think. The owners came .up with the idea for this restaurant from scratch said the most gracious server that told me. I spoke to another patron there for lunch by himself and he was a returny ...cause he had too. He had a chicken and rice lunch that was perfect he said. ?
Service was prompt, suggested I have the hot sauce on the side. Ate the whole dish in my soup. The place? was upbeat with music,? washrooms were very clean and well appointed and private. Not a romantic place but very cool, fun, traditional Peruvian, clean design and quality food. You must go."}
{"text":"Beef heart on a menu - who would have thought?  It was tender and delicious, the sauce was great.  I placed an extra take out order after tasting the quinoa salad.  Loved it!  I'll definitely visit Pio again."}
{"text":"Found this based on the reviews. Someone here puts generous portions of love into the way they prepare the food. 

If you've never eaten Peruvian before check out the photos here, what you get is exactly what you see in the picture, except that despite the simple appearance the flavors are more delightful and complex. 

Finally, the serving staff made me feel like a regular customer. An absolutely top notch experience all around. 

My only disappointment was that I had no room after for dessert. Next time!"}
{"text":"It's a cold wintry fall afternoon.  We've seen the place before but never had time to go in.  This time we  made time  I'm really glad we did.  We decided on the family PIO combo.  This is a large whole roasted chicken with french fries  made from real potatoes a large salad and sauces.  The sauces are interesting one is mayonnaise-based and the other one is mint based.  I don't like mayonnaise but the mayonnaise one was by far my favorite.  We asked for them spicy and it worked out really well.  For dessert we had  Picarones which is a crispy sweet potato donut topped with a homemade sweet syrup and Crema Volteada a fairly standard flat topped with a caramel sauce.

We loved the chicken french fries and salad we had for our main And it was great value at $25.00. The head chef (Mother of the family that owns the place) is one of the owners and clearly cooks with love.  

We will be back excellent quality food,  great service  all prepared and served with love."}
{"text":"Good was great!  First time I had beef hearts and plantations.  I'd go back just for that!

Chicken is tasty.  I had the stir-fry and the only thing I would change would be the fries that came with it.  One it felt out of place, and two wasn't nearly as tasty as the other items we had."}
{"text":"Good food.... clean environment.... excellent service!!

This place has some interesting items in the menu.
The food quality is good, and the servers offer excellent service with smile. There's ample parking in the plaza.

I started with Chicha Morada... a beverage made with purple corn, pineapple and lime juice... a Peruvian classic. Tastes great!!! For main, I tried Aji De Gallina... chicken cooked with yellow Aji sauce.

Definitely it'll be in my shortlist, next time I come to Calgary."}
{"text":"Wow, great find on our weekend trip to Calgary. Great sauces but the chicken doesn't really need it. Had the linguini and sunshine rice and they were awesome. The tres leches was also surprisingly good."}
{"text":"This place is great! Very unassuming, just a casual open space with nicely decorated tables tucked away in a strip mall in the Sunridge area.
The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations and descriptions.
On Wednesdays and Thursdays they have happy hour from 4-8pm, with most of their drinks on sale for $5 - sweet!  However, I highly recommend ordering a regular priced drink, what Peruvians know best - the Pisco sour. It was so delicious and delicate!
We ordered the ceviche, which I've never been too fond of, but it was truly wonderful! Definitely order it spicy! 
Then we ordered their specialty - the rotisserie chicken. It was good - tender, juicy, and the fries were excellent.
But forget that, because you HAVE to have the Peruvian Curry dish! I swear, it changed my life. Mild, creamy, FULL of chicken, flavorful rice - it was heaven.  
We also had the Tres Leches for dessert, which was delicious, but I was truly too full to enjoy it.
This place is a gem - unique, very reasonably priced (entrees around $10-14), and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is a treasure, from the food to the service. If you haven't tried Peruvian food, this is the best restaurant to come try it out. It is family run and they are so friendly, warm and welcoming. The food is amazing - our favorite dishes are the Anticuchos which are so tender and tasty. The Ceviche is wonderful and the lime juice in it is sooo good and we really like their drink the Chica Morada whcih is made from purple corn. Pio is worth a visit, it has something that everyone will like."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Pio is a small family owned restaurant. The decor is great and the service is amazing. Our server was super friendly, teaching us how to order in Spanish and engaging in conversation. But the best part was the food! You cannot beat the value."}
{"text":"My sister highly recommended this place for peruvian food. So we headed there to try some of their stuff. I think their food is great. I love the rotisserie chicken, beef sausage and fries. Also I love the sweet plantains and feta, which my mom end up eating most of it . I guess now we know where I got the genes from liking plantain so much. The Lomo Saltado, which is like a beef stir fry peruvian style, serve with garlic rice and fries are highly recommended too. If you live in the area, this place is a great place for peruvian food."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a friend's recommendation and was happy we visited. Friendly service and tasty food in such an odd location - in a plaza with a sign not easily visible from the main road. 

I ordered a chicha morenga drink which wasn't super sweet, the chicken dinner for two and our son had aji de gallina/ curry chicken on rice. Ours started with a bowl of fresh salad then a large amount of chicken and fries. The chicken was flavourful and fairly moist.  Our son's dish tasted fantastic with a creamy curry style sauce with chunks of chicken and potato on rice.  We ended our meal with churros and enjoyed them hot from the kitchen!  This was a solid meal but not something I'd crave for, as I make roast chicken at home fairly often.  If I'm in the area, will try other menu items that may inspire me to visit more often!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great flavors and the staff was helpful. I got the pio chicken with rice and a site of Platinos. They have crema revuelta (flan) as well that was great! Eat here!"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place. Everyone is so friendly, but the most amazing thing is the ceviche. It's the best ceviche I've ever had and it keeps me coming back. The chicken is nice, the sauces are all amazing, but the ceviche is worth 5 stars alone. Don't miss this gem."}
{"text":"Rotisserie chicken was moist and flavourful.  I enjoyed my meal there.  Go early during lunch to avoid the rush."}
{"text":"Solid five. Simply delicious. Aji de gallina to eat. Its the curry dish. EPIC. 

Drink the chicha morada. Again amazing. 

This could be a massive franchise but there is only one . If this was not n Dallas I would go twice a week...OR MORE."}
{"text":"My first time at Pio Peru - Loved it!  The restaurant opened a little earlier than expected and already, we were the 2nd table of 4 in the restaurant.  The restaurant was about 1/2 full when we left the restaurant after lunch.

Our waitress came by and brought us our menus and also taste tests of their 2 juices they have in the restaurant.  One is the Passionfruit and the other was the Purple Corn with lime juice and pineapple.  We decided on the Purple Corn as it was so delicious, light and not at all sweet.  It's called CHICHA MORADA on their menu.

We ordered:
ANTICUCHOS - \"Super tender grilled Beef Heart skewers with crispy potatoes and Peruvian Black Mint sauce\" (Huacatay).  The most tender beef hearts I've ever eaten!!  2 skewers on a plate with the Huacatay sauce (green sauce).  I love Huacatay sauce!

PIO CON ARROZ - Roasted quarter chicken with yellow rice, comes with 2 sauces - Huacatay and Mayo sauce.  

PIO CON QUINOA - Same as above but with quinoa and bell peppers salad.  I had this dish and it was delicious.  The chicken meat was so tender and juicy.  I love the sauces and they go so well with the chicken.

Excellent wait service.  

Closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.  

Will be back!"}
