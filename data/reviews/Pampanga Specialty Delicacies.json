{"text":"Good place to go when I crave for Filipino delicacies. Very friendly and accommodating. Place is clean which is very important to me. I enjoyed the sisigsilog, it was good! I surely will be back."}
{"text":"Thank you pampangas best the Olympia is delightful and the lumpia shanghai is very good.until next time.God bless on your business.more power."}
{"text":"I feel like they are very dishonest with their prices here! Came here today and bought some cookies and puto along with three bags of dried mangoes for my girlfriend's family to try. My total came out to $20+ which made no sense. For the prices of the puto & cookies, it's understandable. But the dried mangoes must have been waaaaaaay overpriced. (None of their products were priced at all which is really unprofessional and sneaky).  Anyway, I didn't even want to argue with the cashier and paid it anyway. But if you can avoid this place, PLEASE DO.   There are so many other Filipino and Asian stores where you can get snacks and delicacies for half the price of what they sell here. Try Island Pacific, Seafood City, or some small Asian stores. They all carry the same kinds of food and snacks. You'd be better off there than this place who over price their items ridiculously."}
{"text":"They offer breakfast on weekends and among the silog breakfast choices they offer, I like sisigsilog the most and their fried rice is our 1 year old son's favorite!   We just accidentally discovered this place after having brunch at the pancake resto next door and we ended up ordering plenty of tamales, bibingka royale, tarts and ube bibingka for pasalubong! I like the idea of having the free taste platter before you buy.   We will surely come back next time we visit Vegas! Staff and friendly are very accomodating. They even gave us free dessert courtesy of the owner after knowing it's my husband's birthday while we were having breakfast.   Again, Thank you po!"}
{"text":"We ordered a platter and we were gonna pick it up the next day at 1530. We arrived at 1600 only to find out if wasn't ready, it was prepared and the lasy said, \"oh, we forgot!\" seriously, wth?  it would have been okay if we weren't under time constraint, but we were! this is a very upsetting event  and it is very inapproriate, the reason for the 1 star. I just don't understand why this wasn't prepared. the thing is with this experience, the taste of food didnt matter anymore. So frustrating."}
{"text":"Tons of Filipino delicacies! Its a store and bakery in one. They let you sample some items too. We found some great treats that we haven't found in other stores before. Love the small, friendly feeling of this place.   Super friendly lady helped us from the start, recommended items and we ended up leaving with 2 bags of stuff.   Check it out for some Filipino goodness!"}
{"text":"The desserts are so delicious! Millie is so warm and welcoming. I tried a few samples and they were so good, I can't wait to come back for more sweets. Soon they will serve noodles, really looking forward to trying them out."}
{"text":"Have now visited this place at least 3 or 4 times and i always leave with something. They have so many snacks and treats and not too mention the great breakfast you can order. I like that this one of the few Filipino establishments that open at 8am for breakfast. I work nights and i can always pick up food on my way home. Or if im in the mood for some \"silog\" breakfast i can get it early in the morning. They have a great selection of snacks and their desserts have all been amazing! And if your not sure about a dessert they have samples of most of them that you can taste on the spot. The people who work there have always been polite and curtious!"}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by over at Pampanga after having breakfast at BabyStacks and because out of sheer curiosity.  So many specialty foods from the Philippines are sold here and it's very well presented store.  My mom loved it here because she looked around the store so much and even ended up buying quite a few items.  I'm not sure how the prices stacked up here compared to other Filipino markets, they did seem a little more pricier.  It didn't matter that much to my mom though, since we were visiting from out of town.  Very friendly workers, a good selection of snacks and baked goods, and they serve hot meals here as well which is really cool."}
{"text":"I came here on a wim it was next to baby stacks and it was thanksgiving so sure why not pick up a platter came in and they greeted me n helped me to choose the best platter they even gave me samples  So the platter was thirty five bucks for to items or forty for three items or more So I got the forty bucks one So hen when I came to pick up the platter the next day I was extremely disappointed as I counted the items on the platter compared to the individual items for sale it was cheaper to purchase it individually n put it together on a platter yourself I could have saved myself almost twenty bucks if I knew   I mentioned it to Jean and she didn't seem to care much but I didn't want to make it big deal since it was thanksgiving  Jean is a nice lady and helpful but for some reason the concerns I had the next day she changed her attitude towards me kinda weird  The platter could have been much fuller for sure especially paying t"}
{"text":"My sister ordered the entree of kare kare. When we arrived, they told us the ingredients weren't available and they couldn't prepare it. They couldn't call us and tell us, rather wait for us to come in and get us to buy something else. So far the entrees aren't impressive. This place is fine for snacks, treats, and smaller meals like longsilog, bangusilog, etc. The customer service is \"bahalana\" when it comes to selling their large entrees."}
{"text":"Come hungry.. Variety of fresh kakanin, food was great, Service was second to none. Staff and Manage was accommodating! A MUST VISIT PLACE!!!"}
{"text":"It's the same as other restaurant. Food not that great. Won't really recommend the place especially if they live far. They can get the same where they live."}
{"text":"BS +++ ANG SARAP! No one cooks in the Philippines better than someone from Pangpanga.  Hands down one of the best desserts and today we tried the tocino, diniguan, palabok, and more desserts.  I cannot rave about this place enough.  I been to A LOT of Pinoy restos and this is hands down 1. cleanest 2. fresh (they cooked the food after you order) 3. friendliest (no pressure or mean grilling) 4. good prices.  Yesterday we ordered puto and other desserts.  Mostly sticky rice and they were not super sweet.  You can tell they used brown sugar.  The rice was so soft.  The sapin  sapin was to drool for.  I think I needed extra napkins to hold the laway (drool).    I highly recommend you guys try them out for that true authentic pinoy food without the crazy decors or fancy locations.  They don't even have tables.  They have lunchroom style long tables.  I would go here at 730am and get some Tapislog.  Tell them Mickel sent you.  This place is amazing!  Location is CLEAN, NICE, NEW Staff SUPER FRIENDLY and SWEET Parking lot is SHARED and SMALL Restrooms CLEAN and FUNNY Seating is Nice and Clean Pricing is JUST PERFECT (CHEAP)  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"1. No receipt. 2. No price tags and they showed uncertainty of how much each item was worth. 3. They like to lie saying \"oh, here, let me give you fresh ones.\" The expiration says it expired 6 days before the day I bought from them.  Wow. Goodbye."}
{"text":"We taste tested some of the Filipino sweets from this bakery at Island Pacific grocery store and really liked them. My wife said they were better than anything that were available in Texas. So we called the Pampanga and ordered various sweets to take back with us to Texas for family members and friends.  The owner / manager was very cooperative and fresh made our orders.  The orders were ready as promised and knowing that we planned to take the goods back to Texas, she packaged them very securely.  She even threw in some freebies. When we com back to Vegas, we surely will visit again."}
{"text":"We will NEVER use this place for catering again. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. We were throwing a big party in a suite at a 5-star hotel on the strip. Originally we came to pampanga specialty delicacies to order platters of their desserts. When we found out that they catered as well, we decided to just buy everything from one place. (Even though it was more expensive to do so). We made sure to mention that the party was in a hotel and would need to be delivered to the room since the bell desk is not allowed to bring food up. They assured us that it was no problem.  The day of the party, we get a call from them saying that they are parked in the garage and that we should send people down to help bring up food. I asked why they didn't bring a cart or dolly, seeing as we mentioned that they had to bring it up. And her response was that they don't have one, just bring people down. I had no time to argue or wait for their 2 people to carry up 10 full size trays of food and a lechon. It was 1 hour til people started arriving and we were still decorating. My cousins and I ran down to help do THEIR JOB. One cousin took on too much and had to lie down from overexertion. My other cousin and I were told to go down for a second trip. When we got there, there was only 3 trays left not the 4 they mentioned. \"Millie\" proceeded to put the final tray in my arms and said \"Go. I'll wait in the car.\" Really? Now, you are just gonna lounge in your car while we do the labor? WE'RE THE FREAKING CLIENT!!  I've never experienced a more unprofessional caterer in my life. We told you everything you needed to be prepared to do your job. You had over a month to get ready for this job. But this is what happened. To make it worse, the food wasn't even that good. Whenever we have a party, guests always ask where we got the food or who catered so that they can use them for their parties. No one was interested this time around. I guess their food matches their service.   Lesson learned..we will never order from Pampanga Specialty Delicacies again. We never should have strayed from Nanay Gloria."}
{"text":"We stopped by after eating bfast at babystacks which is always bomb. But mom just had to pass by and see what they had. Dad wanted to get sisig as he has been yapping about \"authentic\" sisig. Sad to say but what a dissapointment. They bragged about it being authentic and knowing aling lusing in pampangga. Yada yada yada. But turned out to be fake sisig. Sisig does not have bell peppers in it. And it certainly doesnt have pork ears. Oh well. It would help if they hired a ka pampanggan chef. Not an ilocano. Dont brag about the cooking being authentic when it isnt."}
