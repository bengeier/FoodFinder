{"text":"Really liked the idea of this pop up shop! There were 4 soups to sample (2 vegetarian, 2 chicken) and the portions were enough for a quick lunch/filling snack.   Be sure to stop by the booth and get your goodie bag by the podium since you'll be able to grab some recipes so you can make these soups at home!   #TeamThai"}
{"text":"The staff here were very friendly! You're greeted and encouraged to place a sticker on their board, they will be donating cans of soup to Daily Bread Food Bank.  It was fairly busy. You're given 4 samples of soup and there were a variety condiments/add-ons. The samples were a good portion to fill you up. Currently feeling sick, I couldn't really taste them but I felt the healthy goodness of soup. This was a very nice treat to have. Plus, they give you a goodie bag!   Free food and giving back to the community, awesome job Campbell's!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a very creative idea for a campaign by the team behind Campbell's. They thought of everything and the service was terrific there too. The soups however, were not that great. Although made by the head chef at Rock Lobster, they all were just simply mediocre in taste. Most likely because they had to use Campbell's ingredients. It was still a great event and I think definitely helped their brand."}
{"text":"Excellent 4 soups to sample! Great flavour, great environment, and it's free!  I loved the Thai Chicken and Rice Khao Soi, but I found it to be a bit too peppery. The curry flavour was nice.  My favour was definitely the Roast Beer Can Cream of Chicken Soup. It had a nice creamy texture with a nice smoky undertone.  4 soup samples are definitely filling and make a nice light meal. Check it out before this pop-up shop is gone!"}
