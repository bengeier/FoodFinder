{"text":"Tried this restaurant last night with my wife we found the food very good. The service was smooth and not rushed. The cocktails were different and  very tasty. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The place and service was incredible here. You are never left unattended and the tartare which I never had was incredible. Highly recommended it and this was before I knew what it was. (Raw meat) but the way it's prepared, you wouldn't even notice nor taste it as raw. Our server Willam was great to us, courtesies, and friendly."}
{"text":"Un bon restaurant dans st-lambert  ! Les prix sont un peu élevé, mais les plats sont très bon ! De plus, la carte des vins est très diversifié et pas trop dispendieuse ! 

Bref, cest un bon restaurant !"}
{"text":"Good food and service! I know everyone raves about this place, i find it good but not amazing. I also find it a little pricey."}
{"text":"On parle souvent des avantages de vivre en banlieue en pensant spontanément à Laval. Pourtant, il y a de ces perles inconnues sur la rive-sud de Montréal. Après vous avoir fait découvrir le fruit de ma virée gourmande ici, je vous fait découvrir une autre perle, méconnue, le Restaurant Bidon Taverne Culinaire, à St-Lambert.

À titre d'exemple, pour 2 avec 2 verres de vin, un Mojito, 2 plats principaux et 2 cafés spécialisés avec pourboire: $100"}
{"text":"I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars simply because I wasn't 100% sold on this place and here's why:

The starters ordered: French onion soup, beet salad & farmer's plate.
The judgement: The French onion soup came in a tiny ass ramekin, pretty much creme brulee size, not only that, it was also oddly flavoured, way too sweet, pass, I also have to add that this miserable little thing cost a whopping nine dollars....NINE (please remove this from your menu, it's almost insulting).
The beet salad was small but tasty, the hubby was pleased with his choice, I normally don't like beets but I have to admit I did in this case.
The farmer's plate was pretty darn big, something tells me it was supposed to be shared, however nobody informed us about that, the flavours were nice however.

The mains ordered: Lamb & lentils, Duck confit, Hangar-steak special.
The judgement: My lamb was well prepared, flavour-wise it sort of lacked something for me, salt maybe? It was a weird mix of bitter & sweet. 
The duck confit was pretty much perfect, crispy skin, good flavours, and the barley risotto that came with it was amazing (cheese goodness).
The steak looked good and when asked our friend responded he enjoyed it, so I have to trust his taste buds on that one. 

So 3 stars for now (technically 3 1/2).
I will have to give this place another try, change up my order and see how that goes..."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in St-Lambert minutes from Victoria bridge. Immediately when I walked in I was impressed by the warm and elegant decor with comfortable leather chairs. 
I started with a beer the menu had a nice selection of microbrewery and decided to go with \"la saison du tracteur\" which was really amazing !!!!
For the appetizers lots of crowd pleasers everything from smoked meat Poutine to salmon tartare. I couldn't resist going with the Tuna Tataki! The salad bellow the tuna tasted just as good as the fresh tuna itself. My friend ordered the Poutine was one of the best I've ever had the sauce was very different a little sweet with blended well with the smoked meat.
For the price the resistance I went with the tagliatelle and pancetta pasta covered with pulled lamb which was to die for!!!
Finally yes there was room for dessert and a light custard lemon pie was perfect."}
{"text":"Super ambiance. Cuisine à la hauteur de mes attentes . J'ai adoré l'entrée de boudin succulente . Et mention spéciale aux cocktails"}
{"text":"On the pricey side but best restaurant I've been to in Canada so far. The food was exquisite, I had a chowder followed by lamb that was cooked to perfection - my culinary experience here was pure bliss."}
{"text":"Fabulous place. Fabulous staff and owners who take good care of you. 
$20 Wines Monday nights. 
A must try!"}
{"text":"Encore un autre endroit génial et à découvrir sur la Rive-Sud! Les gens ont parfois une mauvaise image des restaurants en région, mais il y a de petites merveilles!

Nous avons très bien mangé, le service était bien et le vin n'était pas trop cher! Les plats sont plutôt classique, du genre burger, tartares et fish'n'chips et ils sont bien réussis.

Je le conseille à tous !"}
{"text":"Il y a maintenant presqu'un an que nous y étions allé mais rien n'a change dans ce superbe endroit de la rive sud. 

La chaudrée de palourdes est excellente et surtout bien remplie de palourdes.

Le tartare de buf est fidèle a lui même et le burger a l'éfiloché  de porc aussi.

Le service est impeccable et courtois,
l'ambiance est parfaite donc nous  n'attendrons sûrement pas une autre année avant d'y retourner..."}
{"text":"I did not have desert yet but meal was incredible. Nice place. Great service. I'm sure the desert will be great too."}
