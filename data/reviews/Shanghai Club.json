{"text":"I love Chinese food and have been to many restaurants in many different states ,  this by far is one of my least favorites but with not many places to choose from in Anthem i tried it a few times in hopes for a good surprise but that never happen but what really stoped  me from trying anymore was when my brother picked his to go order up and when he got home they called him and told him they gave him the wrong order and asked him to bring it back and when he did the other person came in and they handed the order to them after my brother had already left with it for 20 mins ,  thats just WRONG they have no idea what someone could have done to that food .. Thank gosh it went with a safe person but they dont know that.. Big thumbs down .."}
{"text":"Super long wait. Nobody came up to us and asked us how many people or anything. After twenty minutes, we had to go up to the counter and tell them we had a table for two. The host and hostess behind the counter were totally confused about everything going on. They didn't tell us how long the wait was, but ten minutes later we heard them tell other guests the wait would be thirty minutes. Finally after another half hour, we were seated. The waitress checked up on us about every twenty minutes, our waters were empty a lot of the time, when we asked for the check it took her fifteen minutes to get it for us. We had a whole bowl of soup that we wanted to get a to go box for, and when they came back with the soup in the box, a ton of the soup was gone. We didn't have any silver wear or napkins so we had to ask for those. The only redeeming aspect was the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here. Always good food and good service. I always get the shrimp and green beans. I ask for the white sauce in place of what they normally serve it with and it is amazing. The green beans are so fresh and the shrimp are tasty and big. Hubby loves the shrimp fried rice and filet with prawns. Veggie egg rolls, potstickers and crab puffs are always great!"}
{"text":"I'm dumbfounded with any bad review for this place. Their poor service may be a direct result of how busy they get especially on weekends. As for the food it is OUTSTANDING.  Why do you think people come here. The bathrooms could be cleaner yes , but it's only a bathroom - I come here for the food."}
{"text":"I've been dinning at this establishment for over 10 years now, I feel compelled to write this based on my experience over the past 3 years. I must say that the first 7 years Shanghai Club was probably the best restaurant in Anthem. However that isn't saying much because all the restaurants in Anthem (present & past) are sub par. I found several items on the menu that were constantly good so I stuck with them. Over the past 3 years this place has obviously made some changes because the quality is not the same. It just seems that they are using cheaper products but have still raised prices. I'm in the business myself & I've seen this happen with ownership or management changes an it's usually all down hill from there. Ive witnessed such a decline in caring about the business from the food product to the front door. As I mentioned I have a few staples an one of them is a very simple special order that I've been ordering from the start. It's an order of 
Lo-Mein noodles made Shanghai chicken style. So Shanghai chicken no rice sub Lo-Mein. I always tell them to charge me whatever extra they need to an it's not an issue. However now it's an issue with the rude lady who now takes the phone orders. She refused to prepare my dish the way I asked an kept saying it doesn't come like that but that it came with rice. I explained to her several times that this is how I always order it, I asked her to speak with the kitchen because they will know the order an it won't be a problem but she kept repeating herself telling me that it comes with rice not noodles. At that point I snapped an made the decision that I wasn't going to take her attitude anymore an that I would never eat there again! Anyway enough about that experience. Shanghai will not be missed, good ridden's from my rotation! I used to eat there about once a week for the 1st 7 years but not that often over the past 3 years as my wife hasn't liked eating there for some time now but I still would occasionally get it because they are open till 9:30 so a lot of times it was out of convenience an limited choices. We have recently instead be eating at Dao Kitchen 2 just south of Anthem in Tramonto on N. 27th ave south of Carefree Hgwy more an more often. If you live in Anthem trust me when I tell you that this place is well worth the short drive. Quality ingredients, good sized portions an you get a little free honey banana desert with your meals, but the best part is no attitude from the staff. Bye-bye Shanghai - Hello Dao Kitchen, my new full time go to spot up here."}
{"text":"Those of you asking for them to \"come back\" mosey on up to Anthem - they have a location up here.  The reason is the owners wanted to spend more time with their family so they decided to keep the anthem location open.  Harry, the owner, passed away just a short while back, but the staff at the Anthem location is still all the same and his wife is running the show now."}
{"text":"Gotta give props when props r due, and Shanghai Club deserves praise. I was surprised that SC had so few yelp reviews as it is among the best Chinese I've had in ages. The food is outstanding, to the point of craving. Delicious sauces, hugely generous portions, speedy service, all for around $10 per dish. Lunch specials including a chicken puff and soup (soup dine in only) max out at $7.50 - around the price of a fast food \"value\" meal.

On my last visit I enjoyed Spicy Soft Bean Curd ($8.50), was filled with tons of tofu, fresh mushrooms, fresh snow peas, and lots of other veggies in a light brown sauce. The Hot & Sour Soup (32oz, $6.95), is filled with chicken, shrimp, and veg. I love that the sauces are light and flavorful, not slimy. Fresh veggies in the dishes prove Shanghai Club takes pride in their dishes. 

I usually enjoy take-out, but dining in the beautifully decorated restaurant is comfortable and enjoyable. They put effort into creating a comfortable atmosphere and elegant ambiance. 

Good Chinese food - not from a chain - is hard to find in downtown phoenix. Would I make the trip just to eat there, probably not. Would I go out of my way to hit this spot when I'm near anthem/no phx, definitely. My only regret is I can't find a Chinese resturant that compares to Shanghai Club nearby.

{"text":"I generally don't like to leave reviews, but this is a special case.  I really don't have any issues with the food, I would give it a 3, maybe a 3 1/2, but the service stinks and I'm being polite.  Last week I went in for take out and ordered Chicken Chow Mein and Egg Drop soup. I was told that they had a new \"packer\" and it would take 30-45 minutes.  After 1 hour and 20 minutes I asked to to see the manager, she refused to come out. The hostess said the best she could do was compensate me $3.00 on a $16.00 bill.  I took it.  Foolishly I went back tonight and ordered to eat in, after 45 minutes and still no food, and other tables seated after me having received their food I got and left never to go back again.  Any business ultimately survives or fails on its service."}
{"text":"By far the best hot and sour soup we have ever had!  Can't order it anywhere else now!  Often go for lunch just for soup! Most food we tried there is pretty good too - except for the egg foo Yung was very strange. Had a sticky sweet sauce on it.  Reasonable prices and pleasant dining room."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot after we got sick of the two other places in Anthem that are semi good. We went early, around 5:30 and it wasn't too crowded. But soon after we ordered it filled up and so did takeouts. Had the spring rolls which were the size of burritos and so good. A bit of mint really made the difference. The sesame chicken and low mien were great. Entries are big enough to share and served family style. Thought get two if you are very hungry or want leftovers. Food did not taste like typical Chinese and I didn't feel like crap an hr later. Service was a little odd, sounded like they were working some kinks out. But overall worth going back. I only wish their kids drink options were a little better. No milk (ran out).  But not the end of the world. 
Worth going to!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor as previous reviewers mentioned. 
Wonton soup was the best my dinner partner and I have tasted. The chicken and green bean entree was delicious. We wish we lived closer so we could be regulars there!"}
{"text":"Food...not impressed whatsoever. Food isn't bad but wow not good either.

Ambiance....very nice inside and clean. No complaints here.

Staff...very helpful.

Verdict....I think you could find a frozen dinner at the grocery store with as much flavor if not more. This is the place that you take your snooty friends/family for whom d√©cor plays more of a role than taste."}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese food! Great lunch specials, the food is fresh! Loved the egg drop soup- they deliver it with spicey mustard & a chili sauce if you want to spice things up. I ordered the black peppered beef stir-fry, it was simple and delicious. The ambiance is nice, very clean dining room, bathrooms are very clean and waitstaff was great.  I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Good take out. Limited wine selection. Decent Chinese for Anthem. Then again there isn't much to choose from.  Very friendly people and my food is almost always correct for take out."}
{"text":"This place has TERRIBLE customer service. I had been there the week before and received an incorrect order. I decided to try again and when I asked for brown rice the 50 something chinese woman was extremely rude. Nonetheless, through our conversation I was eventually confident I would receive what I wanted. But, why argue with me and have an attitude? If you have it fine. If you don't, just say so. It was such labored communication and she had a crappy attitude. I felt like I was burdening her and practically had to force her to double check with the kitchen to make sure they had it. After driving 20 minutes home I discovered white rice. (My error for not checking as I thought I'd made it abudantly clear!) They were already closed so I couldn't call. I was in the area a couple days later and decided to drop in. I brought my receipt back and expained what had happened only to find the woman I originally dealt with and another employee arguing with me whether I in fact received the wrong rice and secondly practically calling me a liar because I hadn't called them. Eventually, their resolution was they are unable to authorize a free meal and I'd have to call the owner... I couldn't care less about a free meal and they couldn't care less about treating a 7 year customer with any consideration. EVERY restaurant makes mistakes. It's not a big deal and I am a very reasonable customer. What is a big deal is when they refuse to remedy the situation properly and show a little kindness and concern. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I've made the lengthy trip out to the Shanghai Club I've been for the most part impressed by their restaurant.

The owner always seems to make an appearance and greet us upon walking in, the weekend bartender waits on us so cordially it's become habit to sit as close to the bar as possible. 
And the food always seems to surprise my GF and I in the best of ways! (minus one orange beef :[)

This small restaurant is a real gem;behind the opaque black glass doors there are all sorts of locally made art and traditional chinese instruments mounted upon the walls, the only real downside is the small one person bathrooms that have the habit of being quite unkempt. 

All in all The Shanghai Club is a real gem, chances are if it hasn't been directly recommended to you, you might never stumble upon it! 4 out of 5!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place, and I was pleasantly surprised. Better than any other Chinese food I've had since moving to Arizona."}
{"text":"we love the food here.. and the service is always great!   

They have even a full bar!   

We love just about everything on the menu - from the Sizzling Rice soup to the crab puffs to the entrees like Pork Egg Fu young and the shrimp dishes and the lo mein... etc... they are all good!   You can even order them hot if you prefer spicy!  

To go or eat in - they are all good!"}
{"text":"Their website makes it look like this is a high-end restaurant. It is not. The food was cheap and may as well have been at the mall in the fast food court. The service wasn't great either. And the ambience is also fo their website makes it look like this is a high-end restaurant. It is not. The food was cheap and may as well have been at the mall in the fast food court. The service wasn't great either. And the ambience is also poor."}
{"text":"I am not going back. The problem is that this place is so successful the whole idea of friendly service and quality food has gone out the window. It is literally the \"only place in town\" and that is killing them."}
{"text":"Shanghai Club has a nice vibe, a pleasant crowd and relatively healthy Chinese food.  We had Thai chicken curry and chicken Moo Schu.  Both dishes came with brown rice.  Both were laden with veggies.  They were freshly prepared, hot, and delicious.   With beer, the per tax total was $32.00.  I can't wait to go back and try more food."}
{"text":"Came here last week on lunch because Asian food sounded good.  I bypassed the Bamboo Club because it had 'Bistro' underneath the title, which as we all know - means its slightly more expensive than other places.  Either way I was glad I came here. 

I got the Shrimp & Chicken Hunan Style because it was a lunch special, and I like spicy food.  I was pleased with the decision and the atmosphere and staff.  The food was just spicy enough to call it Hunan and the veggies and meat where both done just right.  

The bathroom's are fun because they are single rooms, so you should lock the door behind you. I did not, and I was washing my hands when I looked up and saw a business man about to whip out his Ding-Dong when he saw me.  It was awkward. He must have had to really go because he barely waited for me get out of the way for him to take care of business...."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food which is hard to find. Shrimp lo mein, chicken broccoli, chicken string bean, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, crab puffs, cashew chicken just to name a few are all delicious."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant, but it closed down thanks to the crappy Bamboozle Club that opened in the same plaza. Phoenix residents wouldn't know a good Chinese restaurant if it bit them in the a__!"}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot in the past and food was always good. Not sure what happened in the past few month but the quality has definitely dropped- not sure if they hired a new cook or simply use cheap ingredients now..."}
{"text":"Soooo the food is lovely, but let's talk about how bad the service is. Much like other restaurants I'll never go to again, the food is not worth how long It takes. Our entire party got their food except for one person and 20 minutes later when everyone was done they decided to bring out the food. If you don't mind waiting five years for your food it's good."}
{"text":"Great food terrible staffing. Ordered take-out. Was told it would be 40-45 minutes took over an hour! They only had 2 girls working the front between phone orders and seating people. I blame the Owners for this debacle. Don't be cheap with labor when you know it's a Friday night."}
{"text":"Great food. Not sure about the meat options as we are vegetarian, but their vegetarian dishes are outstanding. The saut√©ed green beans are simply fantastic.  The spicy bean curd (tofu) is killer, as well as the eggplant. Not a big fan of the crispy tofu dish, but there are about 10 other good veggie options, so there's plenty to chose from. 

Mr. Miyagi say yum yum!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviewer who is wondering what happened to the food here. The quality of the food has definitely gone way down hill over the past 6 months or so. It used to be really good, but now it's just average. We don't really go here any longer now that there is another good option not too far away."}
{"text":"Teriyaki Chicken dinner is enough for 2 people and is very tasty!  The Orange chicken is also a fav.  We like to eat at the bar, because the \"Black Galaxy Granite\" is so beautiful!  We eat there at least once a month.  The service is fast also!"}
{"text":"Big portions and quality. I would not get battered to go cause it gets soggy fast. But is really good."}
{"text":"We first started going to the Shanghai Club in Scottsdale.  What memories, when they moved in 2008/2009 (opened a new restaurant in Anthem), we were going to be so sorry to not be able to get to the food so easily.  The attitudes of the staff and owners?  Priceless, sweet and like family.   A winner for his hot and sour soup (the late Harry), I also love the sizzling rice soup, or war wanton.  We'd go and try something new each time, probably until we completely exhausted the menu.  There really isn't too much I wouldn't order again, and it would have to be because certain things aren't my taste.  

We started traveling to Anthem, (I live in North Scottsdale) not easy, but worth it.  I rarely rate someone unless they are 1 or 5, just don't have the time.  But I have eaten their honey walnut shrimp, they will make the egg drop soup without peas and carrots (I prefer it that way).  I've had their crab puffs--very good, and really love their chicken puffs.  Good BBQ ribs (not much on Chinese ribs, but have still ordered them again because they were good).  My husband and best friend swear by their pan fried and regular dumplings, all really good.  I'm not really a spring roll fan, but my friends also say they really love them.  

Their steak dish (filet mignon with prawn) extraordinary for a Chinese restaurant, they also seemed out of place.  But tender and so delicious and good sized prawns.  They have a huge menu so I could go on for a long time, but their orange scallops and their singapore noodle with spicy curry, I loved.  I'd ask for their chile paste and use a little with both of those dishes.  Egg Foo Young... never had it before, but another one I loved.  

I don't know how you can go wrong here, unless some are advertising other competing restaurants (I noticed on another review).  I don't think you'll be disappointed, in fact I think you will be very pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"What happened? My husband and I have been going to Shanghai for years with absolutely no complaints. The food and service was always superb. Two weeks ago, we walked out after having been seated and no one acknowledged us for upwards of ten minutes. Tonight, the atmosphere was flat. Help/servers wearing sweatshirts and t-shirts. Only two familiar faces on the floor. Our typical appetizers and entrees lacked the flavor we have always loved. We even had to pack our own food to take home. I'm sorry to say, it's our last visit."}
{"text":"Their food is quite good.

Just hope that your order is correct. If not, then your experience will be unpleasant. These mistakes are just that, accidents, but the service I received after I requested the dish I ordered was surprising and disappointing. They also overcharged me for their mistake for food I didn't even eat (a few $ more, which I corrected and received attitude for my request of the correct price).

This is the only Chinese restaurant that I know of in town, so I will probably continue to patronize it. However, if am simply in the mood for Asian cuisine, I will take my business to Dara Thai."}
{"text":"I want to like the food at Shanghai, I really do, but I just don't.  The lettuce wraps are good if you load them up with sauce, but their other entrees are just okay. Hardly any veggies in their entrees. Tonight the Terriyaki chicken was dry & overcooked, the Honey Chicken was mushy, not crunchy on the  outside (it is fried). They have driven me to cook my own Chinese food.  I'm just from cities that had great Chinese restaurants. Hopefully they will change some of their recipes."}
{"text":"Must be new cooks, management or something recently
Sweet and sour pork couldn't chew and greasy
Pork fried rice greasy
I was \"not well\" stomach wise about 6 hours later and I live on chili peppers etc so it was the food, a shame, we loved their food!
His healthy choice white meat chicken was not done. Chicken pink and about half cooked so he threw it away
All he had was rice and the fried noodles on top
Our \"special\" dinner once a month as we are on SS
Whether it was a one time thing or not, they ruined the closest Asian food place for us that used to be great. Since financially we can't eat \"out\" often, we get take out due to his serious illness keeping him from leaving the house except for dr appts
Whatever you changed, it was not for the better
I'm sad about it
I'm sure we can find another Asian place to get take out that hopefully won't have me sick all night
I never get sick! Something was definitely wrong with either the sweet and sour pork or pork fried rice
What a disappointment , an expensive one because this place is pricey
I didn't call manager or whoever man is, he's not the kindest person so as it is, let alone a complaint"}
{"text":"It's okay chinese food, the flavors on a few items like the lemon and orange chicken could be better but teriyaki was always good, with the prices that charge you may be able to find something better in the city."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Anthem and probably my one of my favorite Chinese restaurants of all time. My husband and I get take out from here at least once a week. Their crab puffs are amazing, along with their egg rolls. I typically order their sizzling rice soup. Its filling and very light for Chinese food. My husband orders either the cashew chicken or mongolian beef. Both are to die for. The mongolian beef is my favorite here as its not super sweet like say a PF Changs and the veggies are delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant and they always get our to go orders right as well."}
{"text":"One of THE best Chinese restaurants around. Each time I order from here, they never disappoint.  We've got quite a \"gem\" here in Anthem with this establishment."}
{"text":"I love the lunch specials and the food is pretty good quality. It is also one of the only Chinese restaurants in Anthem"}
{"text":"I understand this restaurant is under new ownership as of January or February of 2018.  I feel that the high quality of the chicken has changed.  I spoke with a friend who had lunch there two days prior to me and she felt the same way.  The food continues to be very good, but please don't change whatever type chicken was used prior as it will eventually make a difference in the number of people coming to Shanghei."}
{"text":"I'm starting to see really good foods and restaurants in the outskirts of my city - for example - this amazing Chinese place in anthem! 

Great ambience with quick efficient service! The food options for vegetarians was plenty. Mistakenly I ordered the veggie chow mein thinking the noodles would be crispy but rather it came with crispy chips on top of a bed of watery vegetables. So I asked for a replacement with lo mein. They were kind enough to replace it and not charge me for it.

The noodles was so tasty and deliciously satisfying! Best Chinese place everywhere!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry cause I love good Chinese food but I have been to this place twice in the last 1-2 months and got the same thing, the combo fried rice with chicken, beef and shrimp. The meat was kind of questionable every time. Here's my problem, first of all it was super bland no taste at all and the Big problem which is kind of hard to admit but I got diarrhea really really bad both times from it and it was not pleasant at all. Super stomach flu like symptoms. So gross, and I highly do not recommend this place and nor will I never step foot in this place again."}
{"text":"I'm actually really impressed with this place. We typically get the same thing and the consistency of how it's made and how much we get and how delicious it is is always spot on!"}
{"text":"I like the pan fried dumplings and the hot and sour soup. The entree plates are huge and made to share. Staff is friendly and the drinks are good."}
{"text":"I order the same items (Fried Rice and Egg Foo Young) for take-out each from this restaurant, unfortunately the taste is not consistent- sometimes favorable, sometimes no flavor. I am on the fence whether I will return for more."}
{"text":"Chicka the China, the Chinese CHICKEN! 
We called up to get some late-ish night take out from Shanghai Club and it turned out to surprise me with delicious, comforting flavors!
My call was promptly answered by a kind and helpful gal who correctly took our order and informed us ot would be ready in 10-15 min.

My cousin had eaten from here before and recommended the Crab Puffs, convinced me that they were decent size, with decent filling, and she was correct! We got an order as an appetizer to share among 3 people,  and we got 8 puffs and 1 side of sweet and sour sauce for approximately 6 dollars, I believe. Cooked perfectly and were satisfying.

Then, my cousin & I shared an order of the classic Sweet and Sour Chicken, which was pretty good! The breading wasn't disgustingly thick, and it came with ample amounts of yummy sauce, and chunks of pineapple, onions, peppers, and carrots.  We decided to just keep the white rice white as it comes with it, and was a nice accompiament (99.9% of the time I upgrade it to Fried Rice).

Our other item we ordered was the Sesame Chicken meal with white rice, and it was perfectly executed! Delish! Perfect amounts of sauce, temperature was just right, and the spices were perfect for the dish.  

In addition to our order, we got a side of Chicken Fried Rice to all share,  and we were pleasantly surprised when we discovered large chunks of chicken fried up with the rice, instead of the usual sparse, tiny chunks here and there that you typically receive from other places.  It was perfect and delicious! 

It has been a very long time since I have had Chinese take-out, I felt as though I should be sitting in a living room with the likes of Penny and Sheldon on BBT or something,  because ever since my husband and I started educating ourselves on what clean foods to put into our bodies, we stopped with Chinese take out.  We would sometimes order freshly prepared \"cleaner\" Asian food in Chicagoland by going to \"Big Bowl\" but they have been slacking and nasty the past several months, so it has been quite a long time since I have had any take out food like this, and it was all quite delicious! I was surprised! 

Thanks Shanghai Club!"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Told 45 minutes for pick up order... Hour and 10 later not ready. Asked for manager... Not there."}
{"text":"Note: This review is from a \"take-out\" perspective

Shanghai Club is a little Asian place in the middle of nowhere (the locals call it Anthem) but it is worth the drive.  Also I like the name because it makes me feel like I'm part of the club, I've always wanted to fit in.  I have gotten take out twice now, sampled a variety of dishes, and have made up my mind.

I like the Shanghai Club.

The food preparation is very fast.  I call them, place my order, and then drive right over and pick it up.  All in all about 10-15min process.  The lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  The price ranges from $6.50 to $7.50 and you get a good amount of food and rice.  You can order from the lunch menu every day till 3pm.

The chicken is a lot like the NHL, all white.  Unlike the NHL though it's warm and doesn't bore me.  I would also promote the Sha Cha Beef if that is more of your thing.  They say it's spicy, but I personally tasted only a very mild kick.  Oh and their soups are huge.  The wonton soup was a meal in of itself."}
{"text":"We have been coming here from time to time for years and we have always enjoyed the food. Today we stopped by on the way back from the northern part of the state and grabbed a very late lunch. The chicken spring rolls are always delicious. We also ordered the orange chicken, general chicken and the chicken lo mein. We like our chicken! The lo mein was fantastic! Probably the best I have had. The other chicken dishes were ok. They weren't bad but there was nothing about them that stood out like the lo mein.

The service was fast and friendly but the bathrooms need some work. One of the waitresses was in there while I was in the woman's restroom and simply rinsed her hands in the the sink for 2 seconds after using the toilet....she never touched the soap. After seeing that I was ready to go. Luckily she wasn't our waitress."}
{"text":"Second time here in past month. Enjoyed chicken curry. Wife had chicken and green beans, others truer sesame chicken, beef with broccoli, all very good and decent sized for lunch."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on a Thursday night.  The place was mostly dead which I liked.  The service was very fast and friendly which was also very good.  The menu is pretty typical for a Chinese type restaurant in Phoenix and so are the prices.  The food was very good especially the hot & sour soup, the sa cha beef, and the fried rice.  We ordered soup, 3 entrees, 1 fried rice, and 1 lo mein and the bill was very reasonable for all that food at only about $60.  If I am ever in the area again and have a hankering for some Chinese food, then I would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"After a decade of consistency, tonight signaled the first major disappointment we have experienced. Each meat dish was replete with vegetable filler. It was a chore to find any protein. We have NEVER experienced this before at SC and we are in hopes the restaurant, known for its consistency, has not decided to enter the slippery slope of value degradation. I will give it one more try, and if we are again disappointed, the word will spread. As a community, we cannot tolerate yet another restaurant walking away from quality. Anthem is lean enough; SC was our only hope. Bad experience."}
{"text":"Ordered to go.  The hostess was very nice.  General's Chicken was bland and loaded with flour, minimal sauce. Sweet and sour chicken was just ok. Don't think we will be going back.
And yes, as another person mentioned, it does smell odd in the restaurant."}
{"text":"In Anthem there are only 2 places to get chinese food. This one is great!  I love everything I have had here. The egg drop soup is great! Hubby love the teriyaki chicken."}
{"text":"Great food.  Great service.  Clean and quiet.  Perfect for conversation.  Plus the prices are very reasonable.  i have nothing bad to say about them"}
{"text":"Waited forever. Ended up leaving to get food sooner. They should not tell people the wait will be 20 minutes when it is over an hour."}
{"text":"The best Chinese around!  The food is fresh and their sauces are clean and refreshing.  You won't find that mushy, drowned in sauce chinese food here.  The staff is always quick and friendly.  It's worth the drive to Anthem...you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the few places that was open for Christmas and what a unexpected present! My bar manager at Fez used to manage for the this restaraunt and suggested we all go in a group. Now, pulling into this place it looked like it would be some hole in the wall restaraunt. It was all black on the outside, so you couldn't  see in and it was in a strip mall!! But let me tell ya, when you walk in there is an immediate change of heart as soon as you see the fountain waterfall in front of you. 

It had the traditinal round table and lazy susan so everyone can share meals. I enjoyed EVERYTHING and I was so happy that the Shrimp was the big juicy kind and there were plenty of them! I hate when you go to restaraunts and get  those little shrimp that looked like they were the last  few in the bag that  they bought at safeway!

We tried the filet mingon(spelling?), walnut shrimp, and plenty other stuff I cannot remember the names of. I was afraid of trying the walnut shrimp but so glad I did! All the flavors were yummy, nothing to overbearing with sauces. The waitress was right on point as well. Matt (my bar manager) worked with her when he was there and told me almost all the staff was the same. When you have that at a restraunt you know their doing something right! The owner even came out and was a really nice man, and asian!! (I've worked at Zen32, he's not asian!LOL)


So... DO Go here if your close in the area, it will be one of your favs!"}
{"text":"Fast service - I come here for the lunch specials. Under ten bucks for entree, rice, two crab puffs, and egg drop soup"}
{"text":"Amazing ! amazing! amazing good, yummy BBQ ribs!!!! OMG! Shanghai club offers fresh tasty food! We also ordered string bean chicken and chicken, beef and pork Lo mien. They are all delicious!!!"}
{"text":"One of my families favorite spots for dinner. Not the best Chinese food but for Anthem it is pretty darn good. Food in consistent and service is speedy. Orange chicken is bomb. Chicken Thai Curry is good, beef and broccoli is awesome. Rangoons are good to start as well as the egg drop and sweet spicy soup. We like to order a bunch of dishes and share."}
{"text":"There are not many good places to eat in Anthem, but the Shanghai Club is pretty good.  They are tucked away in a small strip center across the street from the Anthem park in the center of town. They are a small restaurant and can be very busy at times. I notice a lot of people order take out!  They are too pricey compared to similar restaurants in Phoenix at $15 -$25 per person.  They are almost competing with PF Chang's prices but they are not PF Chang's.

Their menu selections are traditional American Chinese. They offer a good selection of Chow Mein and Lo Mein noodle dishes, sea food, pork chicken, beef and vegatarian dishes.  Some of their dishes can be order spicy and/or without sauce.  They also offer steamed dishes served with sauces on the side for the healthy conscious. 

We had their egg drop and hot and sour soup.  Their Hot and Sour soup was very good and it came with shrimp in it.  The white meat chicken with vegtables was very good. The garlic sauce was excellent and it made this dish delicious.  The General's Chicken was good but not as spicy as in most places.  The Beef with Broccoli is not something I ordered but got to taste it and found it very good as well.  I am planning to order their Shrimp and Scallop in Garlic Sauce next time we go there! 

If your in this area and wanting American Chinese food, this is a good place to go.  Split a dinner with a friend and you'll feel like you got a bargain!"}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food. If you don't feel like driving 20-30 minutes for your fix  of Chinese shanghai club will do fine. Again nothing special just average hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Ate at the Shanghai Scottsdale location regularly until they closed. This is the only location still open. Honestly, this past Saturday when we discussed where to go for something good, Shanghai came up. My husband has not been to this restaurant and we decided to take the plunge and drive the 30 miles, We were not disappointed. Yen who waited on us for years was there and remembered us. The Macadamia Nut Chicken was so good, lots of veggies and a delicious almost creamy garlic sauce. Tons of Macadamia nuts. The barbecue ribs were loaded with a sweet tangy sauce and the mongolian beef was out of this world. 
I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, I love a good family run place and this is it."}
{"text":"Just like the other reviewers have mentioned, while the food is pretty good, the service and flexibility is non-existent.

I ordered the shrimp and scallop garlic sauce. I don't really like rice and prefer Lo Mein noodles. When I asked for a substitution, I thought the server had seen a ghost. She quickly said. No...they can't do that. I asked not even with an upcharge? No. can't do it.

Wow. I was stunned. I probably should have just left but I took the dish as is. Their motto should be \"You get what you get but you don't pitch a fit.\" Really? A minor substitution like that? The place was fairly empty and it reminded me that again, I need to read Yelp before I go.

Two stars for the food quality."}
{"text":"I went to the Shanghai Club for dinner recently with my BF... it was a weeknight and we chose it based on location and the fact that I felt like Chinese Food.  (It's conveniently located right off of the 101 and Shea in the Pima Crossing shopping center).  I'd been once before and it was decent so I was open to going again.  

Since my last visit (which I realize now was over a year ago), they remodeled the place... it's actually a step up from what I remembered in terms of decor.  The service was attentive although the atmosphere was pretty quiet.  It was perfect for what were in the mood for: a quick, casual dinner.  

We started with a bowl of Wor Wonton Soup for 2... I liked it because it had a generous amount of shrimp, chicken, veggies, and wontons inside a light broth.  I ordered the Spicy Eggplant and J went with the Thai Curry Chicken (and we shared both).  Portions were pretty big but we managed to eat almost everything... We both agreed that the Spicy Eggplant was much better than the Thai Curry Chicken; I'd suggest going to a Thai Restaurant for Thai Food and going with a more traditional Chinese entree if you visit Shanghai Club.

Overall, Shanghai Club is just above average... I will return eventually... but it's never going to be a regular in our restaurant rotation!

****For healthy eaters, Shanghai Club offers steamed dishes served with sauce on the side and brown rice too - you gotta love that!"}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since it opened like 10 years ago. I think it is the best Chinese food easily! Amazing take out and lunch specials are awesome. I actually moved in town and will still drive to anthem to get this Chinese food because I can't find anything like it in town. 

The crab puffs and hot & sour soup are a got to have! Hot& sour soup is a must have if your sick or have sore throat, tastes amazing and has little spice to clear up nose. 

I have literally had about everything in the menu and I love everything! This is my family and I favorite Chinese by far!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so let me start off by saying that my very first job, 15 years ago, was as a hostess for the owners when they owned Royal China in North Scottsdale. Such a trip to be taking my kids to their restaurant in Anthem now! I remember going to Royal China when we had just moved here from CA (before I started working there) and it was the only place in AZ (then) with good Chinese. And, in my opinion, they are still doing it right! 
Its not cheap (for dinner), but I think it's worth paying a little but more because you really do get a lot of food, and I've never had anything I didn't like. 
My favorite things are the crab puffs and the won ton soup. The won ton soup is soooo good, tons of veggies and (pork) won tons, and they give you so much. That's all I need to get for dinner, and I'm good to go! Oh, and I love their pot stickers. Best pot sticker sauce ever. I hate when places give you soy sauce! That's not what I want for my pot stickers!! My husband loves the beef with broccoli, my son loves the orange chicken. The chicken fried rice is also yummy, also a big portion with lots of chicken. I think they pretty much only use white meat, my favorite. Everything seems to be fresh and good quality.
We usually get take out, for dinner, but if you go for lunch, the prices are good, and you get soup and I think a crab puff. So, if you're looking for a good deal, definitely go for lunch. 
No matter what, you will leave full. Service is usually pretty good, too. The restaurant is nice, as well, its not cheesy or tacky."}
{"text":"Went here with family for dinner, and I was very pleased with the food.  Everything I tried was great!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  We had the steamed dumplings appetizer, an order of the Thai Curry and an order of Mu Shu Pork.  The Pork was the clear winner here.  
Service wasn't great and it wasn't terrible.  Everyone was very friendly and accommodating but we felt really rushed and had to flag people down for water, forks, etc.  
Ever since my husband and I traveled to China last year we've been searching for a restaurant in Phoenix that serves honest-to-goodness-Shanghai-style Xiaolongbao steamed dumplings (bamboo steamer, yummy soupy-pork filling, etc), but alas, the search continues....these are the standard issue half-moon shaped pot stickers filled with chicken.  Damn you, American palates!  They were just okay.  If I ordered them again I'd definitely go with the pan-fried option for a little texture.  
Nice modern interior.  If you're in the area, definitely check it out.... I just don't know if I'd drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Anthem/Phoenix I really miss it since I don't live nearby anymore.  Takeout was the norm. Shrimp Chow Fun is fabulous and I really love the Won Ton Soup, just a few green onions, broth and the won tons-yum so tasty especially on chilly nights. The Crab Puffs and Fried Shrimp are always a must. I really love the Moo Shu Pork too, so if you're a fan order it."}
{"text":"Agree with the last commenter Rollie B about the few strongly worded 1 star reviews.  (Notice, that they only have 1 review posted, seems fishy). I only give 4 stars as almost anyone and anyplace has room for some improvement.  Anyway, we have been eating at Shanghai Club for over 10 years when we lived in Anthem.  Just stopped in tonight for carry out rather than dine in.  I cannot think of a time when I have been disappointed.  It has been consistently good, fast and generous portions, whether for lunch or dinner.  It has always been clean and restroom has been attended to.  Water and beverages were always served promptly.  This is not one of those places where the waiter/waitress will sit and talk with you, etc.  Get cheeky with conversation, but that is not to say it hasn't been good service.  It is no non-sense ordering.  You place your order and in minutes the food comes.  Isn't that what eating out is suppose to be?  Long and short, it is good, hot, fast food in a calm and relaxing environment.  They do get very very busy at times, people got to be realistic.  Will continue dining at Shanghai Club when in the area."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOW CLOSED.

The food definitely deserves a good rating tho.  They had great lunch specials.  Service was always quick and friendly.  Prices were spot on.

I MISS YOU SHANGHAI!  COME BACK"}
{"text":"We absolutely love Shanghai Club. When we moved in to Anthem in 2005 we discovered this gem of a chinese restaurant. I love the Chow Fun or the Chow Mein with crispy noodles. They are always prompt when we order take out and quick service when we dine in. I'm sure we will continue to go there for years to come."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place since we moved to Anthem. I probably eat here at least once a week. I get their sizzling rice soup and crab puffs. My faves. I also love their Mongolian beef. It's not uber sweet and it has tons of saut√©ed onions and bamboo shoots love it!  My husband loves their cashew chicken and their pork fried rice is amazing as well. I have yet to have a bad meal here. Best most consistent restaurant in Anthem. We need more like these."}
{"text":"Just moved to the north valley and was looking for a good chinese takeout spot.  A friend recommended I give Shanghai Club a try.  I ordered the Steak Filet and Prawns, appetizer sampler, and chicken fried rice.  Everything was amazing and yummy!  I have not one complaint and will definately be my first choice for chinese when I'm in the mood."}
{"text":"The food is always great here and the service isn't bad either. Not sure why they only have 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Considering the location, it's not too bad. Not the best Chinese food I've ever had but not horrible. It's somewhere in between Panda Express and real authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"Overall food is good. They are consistent. 
Prices are a little high."}
{"text":"Great value and really well made Chinese food, from a local place in Anthem.  Any dishes I order here are excellent and provide for plenty of leftovers!  Try their BBQ ribs, which are listed as an appetizer but as far as I'm concerned could be an entree, the serving size is that big."}
{"text":"I am back and once again I was not disappointed. Our party of 5 fortunately had reservations for the Friday dinner time. Everyone except me who was hungriest left with food from the meal. I had the Thai chicken curry at a two level of heat and it was perfect along with a Singha beer. Others ate mixed vegetable and various delicious meals with a bit more heat. Service was excellent, food out shortly after we received our drinks. Jasmine tea was a bit weak with small amount of tea in the pot ... Only complaint I heard during the meal. I have to keep this place on my list of places to stop just off Interstate 17 in Anthem, Arizona, north of Phoenix -- good to know if coming back to Phoenix from the Grand Canyon."}
{"text":"I love their food. Whenever I have friends or family over for a visit I take them to Shanghai Club. All of my experiences dining in has been great. I prefer to carry out and my only complaint about calling in my order is the accent of either myself or the person taking my order causes a lot of repeating. I wish I could share a recording, you have an Asian accent one end and somewhat of a southern \"Swamp People\" accent on the other end (that's me). Dining in I can just point at the menu item. I will say after making over 50 carry out orders over the years with them I never had a screwed up order. The food is great, my fav is the Triad in One. The food has always been consistent, fast and delicious."}
{"text":"We have become regulars here, and the food is always consistently good. Really, our favorite Chinese place regardless of location."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten here a half dozen times since moving to New River last summer. The food has been excellent every time. We've had a wide array of dishes and they've always been tasty. The meat dishes always have ample meat. Service is quick and drink glasses are kept full. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"New to the area and have dined here 4 times in the past 1+ wks. Good and consistent service. Xlnt food! Good prices. Fantastic savory flavors in the dishes we've tried so far. Generous portions. Love their Shanghai Spicy Chicken, Chow Fun with chicken, beef and shrimp. Even their brown rice is good. Gotta go back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I was craving Chinese food and a quick Yelp search showed the closest options around us. The only negative things I read were about no substitutions, and I don't think that really reflects on the quality of the food so we headed inside!

First off my iced tea was great. I know that sounds lame to care about the quality of the iced tea, but most places I go it's so watered down and has no flavor at all. So this place was already on my good side.

I ordered a cup of egg drop soup, and the orange chicken. She gave us the choice between steamed white or fried rice. My boyfriend ordered the honey chicken, and a chicken spring roll. The soup came as well as the fried chip things with sweet and sour and hot mustard. Honestly I could always eat the hot mustard by itself at Chinese restaurants! The soup however was full of veggies and what seemed like small cubes of tofu. This made me sad because I like a plain and simple egg drop soup, and there was no description on the menu stating it came with all the veggies, or else I would have asked them to not add it if possible. So I dipped my spoon and tried to get only the broth and little runny egg, the flavor was there but muddled with cooked carrots, mushrooms, peas, onion, and possibly tofu. I tried my bf's spring roll and it was very fresh and hot.

The steamed rice came out in a covered container, and soon after our main dishes. The orange chicken smelled almost like fermented oranges, but also like someone just peeled an orange to eat the slices. I really enjoyed the taste. It was tart and had some heat but then a bit of sweetness. The chicken was coated in a crunchy batter and the inside was full of white juicy meat. Very good compared to a lot of places. The honey chicken was also good but didn't have the same pop of flavor as the orange.

We ate until we knew it was time to ask for boxes. Some more positive notes were our waitress was pleasant and always filled my drink before it got close to empty, and the fortune cookies she brought were light and delicious. The prices really weren't bad either I thought. Most dinners were under $10."}
{"text":"First and last time I ordered to go they said 20 min. I arrived early food was  ready I took home less than 5 min. Shrimp was up side down out of container the other food was soggy and cold I would not recommend  this restaurant. IT USED TO BE BETTER"}
{"text":"Three friends and I went for lunch today. I don't think we'll go back unless we hear about improvements.

I had the \"General Chicken\" lunch combo for $7.50. The hot and sour soup was so-so, but I had to add their \"sweet sauce\" to make it interesting. Although the obligatory chili icon indicate this was a spicy dish, the General Tso's chicken had zero heat and very little flavor. If I had to guess, I'd say it was just colored corn syrup for sauce. The crab puffs we're big and packed... with dried, crumbled blah inside. I didn't bother eating the second one. 

My friend who ordered the same dish agreed that everything was \"eh\". The other two weren't impressed with their chow-mein or the Shanghai Club special.

The decor is nice: dark, comfortable atmosphere with tasteful water fountains and traditional Chinese instruments on display. The staff was great, too bad the food is weak."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. The service is usually subpar. Food as mentioned above is different each time. The chicken fried rice is either oily or dry. The orange chicken is very chewy which I do not enjoy. Prices are average I'd say. Overall not bad, but certainly not the best place for Chinese food in North Phoenix"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place only has 3.5 stars.  In my honest opinion this is one of the best chinese restaurants in the valley.  I live 25 minutes away and make time to drive to anthem to eat here.  I ran into this place by accident hanging out at the anthem community park across the street and im so glad I did.  Food is DELISHHHH and the portion size is extremely generous.  I have a hard time finishing all my food.  For the portion size the price is more then fair.  I usually have the general chicken or the honey chicken but you really cant go wrong with almost anything on the menu.  Customer service has never been an issue with me.  Sometimes they seem a little busy and over worked but its expected when they are serving great food like this.  Please don't ever change as I will be a customer for life :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times over the past 2 months with my family. The service is great and the food is very good. The egg drop soup is highly recommended! I would have to say it's the best valley wide. We drive up from Goodyear for it!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for over a decade. Every time we are seated quickly, reasonably attended to, & the food is always remarkable. In my 15 years of dining here, I honestly cannot remember a single mistake on our orders or food. Good quality, quick service, and a nice atmosphere for friends, family, and children. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Jade Palace is better.  And I only compare the two because they're pretty close to one another.  Shanghai Club is pretty decent though, but it's not the greatest Chinese food I've ever had.  

I stick to the classics though, so I could be missing out on a great specialty dish that would have made me give this place an extra star.  Alas, my meal consisted  of spring rolls, fried rice and veggie lo mein. 
Why am I sooo boring??

I did have leftovers, my bill was reasonable and service was good.  If I go back and try a more exciting dish, I'll update this review!"}
{"text":"I ordered the General Chicken. Was certainly looking forward to chinese food. The chicken was so dried out, it was horrible. I am guessing it sat thier all day? The breading was so mushy too. I wouldn't eat their again.cheri"}
{"text":"I have ordered take out here at least 3 times since I moved to Anthem 3 years ago.  The meal is your typical run of the mill Chinese food.  However the last two times I called for a take out order I was told the wait time would be 45 minutes plus.  Which seems weird to me be cause they always told me about 10 - 15 minutes before.  So I asked how busy were they, the girl on the phone said oh not too bad, puzzled I asked how long it would take to eat there... she said they are bussing tables now and there is no wait...  So me and a buddy of mine went there to eat... I timed our meal from when we walked in to walking out the door... total of 35 minutes... our food arrived around 10 minutes after ordering.  What a joke 45 min for a take out??? For mediocre Chinese food.  I won't be dining there again."}
{"text":"Kind of a funny experience here:  After shopping at the nearby outlet mall, my husband and I decided to look for a Chinese restaurant for lunch.  We found the Shanghai Club at random, but almost didn't go in because from the outside it looks more like a strip club than a proper restaurant.  Imagine our surprise when we opened the mirrored glass front doors just to peak inside, only to find a restaurant filled to more than 50% capacity at lunchtime on a Tuesday. We both ordered from the lunch specials, ranging from $6.50 to $7.50.  I had the Mongolian beef and he had the orange chicken. The cuisine here is standardized Chinese-American food to the max, but both our meals were well prepared, tasty, and of good portion size. The orange chicken was made with all white meat, and fried in relatively fresh oil.  Even my side of banal hot/sour soup was good. My Mongolian beef was slightly overloaded with onions, but included a generous helping of tender stir-fried beef.  I would easily have given this place a 4-star rating had the food been a little more interesting and creative.  The dining room and bathroom were both very clean and orderly, and the place had a nice feel about it.  We'll likely be back next time we're in Anthem."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the Northwest Valley."}
{"text":"Must be new cooks, management or something recently
Sweet and sour pork couldn't chew and greasy
Pork fried rice greasy
I was \"not well\" stomach wise about 6 hours later and I live on chili peppers etc so it was the food, a shame, we loved their food!
His healthy choice white meat chicken was not done. Chicken pink and about half cooked so he threw it away
All he had was rice and the fried noodles on top
Our \"special\" dinner once a month as we are on SS
Whether it was a one time thing or not, they ruined the closest Asian food place for us that used to be great. Since financially we can't eat \"out\" often, we get take out due to his serious illness keeping him from leaving the house except for dr appts
Whatever you changed, it was not for the better
I'm sad about it
I'm sure we can find another Asian place to get take out that hopefully won't have me sick all night
I never get sick! Something was definitely wrong with either the sweet and sour pork or pork fried rice
What a disappointment , an expensive one because this place is pricey
I didn't call manager or whoever man is, he's not the kindest person so as it is, let alone a complaint
You should CLEAN this restaurant ! It's filthy inside, the dark colors aren't fooling anyone!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese restaurant in the area! The service is always consistent and our favorite waitress - Becky - always makes time to spend with each of her guests. The food is great - Very tasty & made to order - with substitutions allowed! We had the Shanghai Spicy Chicken, Beef Egg Foo Young and pork fried rice. Started with pot stickers that are fresh, home made and come with a freshly made house chili paste that is to die for **sniffle sniffle** SPICY! They do have a full bar - but we don't drink... Good home made iced tea though! There is rarely a wait for a table... The restrooms are spotless and the dining room is never messy - never uncleared tables or spills. If something isn't right - they fix it - and by that - all I mean is that I ordered extra spicy - and I think the Chef was afraid it would be too hot - so I had him add more sliced hot peppers. For me - the hotter the better. Overall this was the perfect dining experience for us!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant just off of Anthem Way.  This is a sit down... not a buffet... and the food is delicious.  Fresh crispy vegetables and well seasoned meat dishes and great sauces.  I haven't had anything I have disliked yet.  You can also order the spicy entrees as hot or mild as you like.  The owners of the Shanghai Club obviously care about their customers and are dedicated to making your experience as pleasant as possible.  The prices are higher than the average buffet but the food is far superior to anything else I have found in the North Valley.  

The restaurant is small but the decor is pleasant and clean and the service is very good.  I highly recommend this one."}
{"text":"Food was good. I'd go back to try other items on the menu. 

Had the Thai chicken curry and cashew chicken. The highlight of the meal were the crab puffs, they were delicious, but I do love the sweet and sour sauce in general.  The chicken curry was good, but it was missing something. It needed a little more of a kick. The cashew chicken was yummy, had good flavor. 

Had take out so I can't speak to the service, inside was busy, nice ambiance."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good Chinese food (especially for Anthem, too). What I love about this place, is you rarely have to wait for a table. If you do, the wait time is fairly short. Their lunch specials are definitely worth it and are what keep me coming back. My favorite item on the menu is their Walnut Shrimp (once you eat theirs, you can never look at Panda Express' Honey Walnut Shrimp again). The food comes out pretty fast, but it is hard to get a hold of your server in general. They seem to only be there to take your order, deliver your food, and take your payment. I guess it depends who your server is, but we rarely get checked on and when we ask for something, it takes awhile to get it. Still, the service is decent. I prefer this Asian restaurant versus others in Anthem (ahem Dara Thai--yes I know Chinese and Thai food are different--and Hong Kong Asian Cuisine)."}
{"text":"Anthem, AZ has Chinese food - consistent, tasty, reasonably priced and with stellar service!! Who-da-thought!? 

Can't even remember how many times we've ordered out from this place (most always with an expired coupon & they kindly have honored!) - and NEVER, seriously SURPRISINGLY NEVER been disappointed. Not so much as a soggy egg roll. No missing sauce. No snotty service or mediocre service. 

You may dine in, there's always bar seating & must be decent because it's always at least half-full or more when I pop in to pick up. We've dined in once - a long, long time ago. 

FAVES: (dinner portion comes w/white or brown rice)
Mongolian Beef
Moo Shoo Pork (plum sauce is great)
Sesame Chix
Filet Mignon & Shrimp

I can't speak to their \"customer sat\" if you aren't satisfied... because NEVER disappointed. POW!

Look at these pics to see eye-(and box)popping portions!"}
{"text":"My mom taught me if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all. But, I never listened very well.
Icky sweet and glutinous sauces. Poor quality meats. Breading that is inedible and over cooked veggies that were limp and tasteless. Even the won tons were terrible. If this is what passes for 4star Chinese fare, I would rather go without.
I have tried this place 5 times since moving here in January and have yet to enjoy their food. Never again."}
{"text":"Poor service, acted like she was doing us a favor. Food was average at best and they added extra charges for every little thing, including $1. for salt! Unbelievable. Don't appreciate being nickle and dimed!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Anthem. Service was very slow last night. (Sunday February 25th). We waited at the front desk for 10 minutes to even be acknowledged, 10 more to be waited on and longer than normal for the food. Very unlike their normal high level of customer service. But the food was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After a couple years' break, I went back to retry their food, and the quality is back what it used to be.  We had Cantonese style fried noodles, black pepper beef, curry fish and Shanghai spicy chicken.  Nothing here is actually spicy even though the menu has pepper symbols next to some of these dishes.  It was all good.  (Not too crazy about the take-out orange chicken because it just gets too soggy by the time I get it home). I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this restaurant! Clean, stylish, and good food. It was in an unlikely location in a strip mall, but once inside, it was very nice."}
{"text":"my husband loves their mixed fried rice.  Honestly though, their egg foo yong is one of the worst versions I've ever had.  food is bland.  I think it's popular in Anthem b/c it's one of the few more \"upscale\" looking places.  Also, the food is greasy.  we've only ordered take out, not sure how the waitstaff is"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal or experience here! I love the hot n sour soup, chicken lo mein & honey chicken! There has never been a wait and service is always top notch!"}
{"text":"Used to be great place. Food is horrible now. Doesn't feel fresh and soup had a smell. Chicken and beef cold inside and all saggy."}
{"text":"We walked in the restaurant and it smelled like sewer.  They did not clean their grease traps.  We left because the smell was overpowering.  Don't think we are going back.  Our concern is that they are not clean.  I really was in the mood for hot and sour soup, but the odor quickly changed our mind.  They lost our business because of their no attention to detail."}
{"text":"i would give them no stars, if possible.  we have been going there for years, and the last two times, we were there, we were so disappointed.  i believe they have changed hands.
the wait staff does not care that you are even there.  my husband asked for a full glass of ice for me.  never got it.  had to ask again.  not good.
the place is dirty.  the grounds are awful. they have an area outside that at one time was for outdoor dining.  it is in such bad shape.  there are bamboo shades just thrown in the corner, and the fencing is all destroyed.  there is no excuse for that, as it can be seen from the inside windows when you sit near the windows.
the bathroom was filthy, again, no excuse.  
our waiter was so unfriendly, and it seemed like he was being bothered that we were there. it was late lunch time and just a couple other people were there.  so again, no excuse.  the wait staff and cooks cluster around a table at the far end, and do not check on patrons nearly enough. 
we had to ask for noodles for our soup.  and speaking of soup, we had the egg drop, and it was so bland, we could not flavor it no matter now much salt and pepper we used.
we have given them two chances, once with a large church group, which can be a bit harder to service, and yesterday with just the two of us.  no more.  we will not be back.  there are other restaurants within driving distance that we will go to.
sad to say they have gone downhill so fast and hard."}
{"text":"\"First rule of Shanghai Club: Don't Talk About Shanghai Club!\"

As you can see, I like their name - it sounds like someplace dangerous and exciting. Like if people ask me what Shanghai Club is, I can tell them I'm not allowed to talk about it. And they won't pursue the matter either, because as far as they know, I might dragon kick them in the throat while throwing ninja stars or something. Of course for Anthem residents, they'll probably just ask me how my meal was. And I'd respond with something like \"Very good. I really like their Chicken Fried Rice and the Orange chicken was very tasty as well. The service was great, and the ambiance inside is nice as well. I also love their pork lo mein.\"

Yep, that is probably what I'd say."}
