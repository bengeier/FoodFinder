{"text":"This is an exceptional place. Fresh fish done to perfection in a casual chill atmosphere. John the owner and Heather the hostess/barkeep are friendly and knowledgeable. Local beers, ciders and wines. A very memorable meal."}
{"text":"What a hipster little gem this is! Came with the fam, they accommodated our reservation and perched us on a cozy high-table. Decor was comforting and casual. Like when you go to that friend's home - that friend that is for sure cooler than you and with better taste - and you just feel like you belong in her kitchen table. Like that. Service was friendly and quick. Then came the food - Yelp, can we please have a sixth star?! We seemingly ordered everything (okonomiyaki, tataki, chowder, salmon, cod, fish sandwich, and dessert) (note to self: that was definitely too much) and each dish was splendid. The fish was expertly cooked and and well-seasoned, the okonomikayi was flavourful, crispy & creamy, and had the fun, dancing bonito flakes on the top. The chowder was classy and chock-full of good stuff. The sandwich was a great contrast between crispy baguette and flaky fish (and this tasty dill aioli that reminded me of my childhood's favourite burger!). Prices were extremely reasonable for the quality and portion size. Definitely scoot on over to the Junction and chow."}
{"text":"How does a fish store keep things fresh?  Serve what you sell of course!  Other places also do this but it's easier said than done.  At worst it becomes an after thought and customers can tell right away.  I'm glad to say that Honest Weight cooks the seafood right.  I ordered both the clam chowder and the curried squid/pineapple salad and both were very nice.    The chowder had a nice smoky taste to it from the bacon bits and the mussels and clams were plentiful.  The bread is not their own as another reviewer wrote but ordered in and they choose a very nice place to do so.  Credit to Honest Weight for not going cheap with the bread.  Matched the soup nicely.    Squid was done just right, not rubbery but definitely not raw either.  The dressing was a yoqourt/tartar/mayo blend of some kind, very nice.  The grilled pineapples were nice and complimented the squid with a bit of citrus, a nice change from the typical slice of lemon.    Also bought some fish to take home to cook that same night and that turned out to be very good also.    So all in all, a very pleasant experience and I'm sure the Junction will be very happy that Honest Weight is the neighborhood as I'm sure word is going to spread as it seems to be getting quite a bit of buzz already in the media.  I'll definitely be back to pick up more fresh fish next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch. Had the oysters and okonomiyaki, they were both delicious. This place is a welcome addition to the junction. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This was the most satisfying meal I've had in a long time in Toronto! We went after a long sunny day in high park.  I had seafood chowder and a fish sandwich and my partner had bouillabaisse. The bun was perfect for the sandwich- soft and chewy w great aioli, fresh good quality lettuce and the fish for that day was rockfish. It would be more than sufficient for lunch. With rich chowder it made a perfect dinner. The bouillabaisse was flavourful and rich with a huge variety of shellfish and fish. As a nice touch, the bluefish in the bouillabaisse was pan fried crispy (in a tiny bit of cornmeal maybe?) before it was placed in the soup.  Service was excellent and music and environment was great. My only very minor sticking point was that the tables are pretty long, which felt pretty formal at first, but as food came it was good to have the space.  Will definitely be going back frequently."}
{"text":"Just shopped at Honest Weight. Bought Halibut, which was filet as I ordered. Super price. Same amount at regular supermarket costs quite higher. BUT THE HIGHLIGHT of my visit was the smoked salmon in house cured. I know my smoked salmon - AND THIS IS the smoked salmon of smoked salmon. Absolutely fantastic! Will be a regular customer. Hope to have lunch there soon!"}
{"text":"I would give it 7 stars if I could! The service is outstanding, a very casual, familiar vibe in a chic environment -- a very hard balance to achieve and they nailed it. Everyone is very knowledgable about everything on the menu, from food to drinks, they nailed it. One of those places that you can say \"give me your favorite\" and you'll leave delighted. Some of the most memorable oysters I've ever had, and definitely the best in Toronto. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super pretentious with horrible service. Came by with 3 friends on a cold and rainy day and was told that the wait would be about 45 mins long. We asked if we could sit by the bar and have a drink while we wait, only to be told that it's not an option, even though there was free stool seating right by the bar and entrance area. As we were trying to figure out where to go and grab a drink, while we wait for the table, we were pretty much told to leave and not stand in the high traffic area. Who kicks their customers out of a restaurant on a rainy day? What high traffic area? It's a tiny little restaurant with absolutely no traffic. Just horrible. I have never  experienced this level of rudeness in a restaurant. We walked over to Nodo and had a wonderful dinner with amazing service.  We are so glad we didn't wait for the table because we received the call 2.5 hours after instead of 45 mins. Very disorganized. This is just hype and with this kind to  service,  I can't imagine why anyone would want to go there. They looked so bothered by their customers and were not welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Honest Weight hardly requires another favourable review but since I was on the fence whether to eat here I wanted to add to the other kudos.  The food was fantastic, from the freshly shucked oysters to the seemingly out of place okonomiyaki, the freshness and quality stood above all else.   Our party wasn't drinking alcohol but the flavoured sodas were a delicious heat quenching alternative.  The okonomiyaki was more omelette like than pancake but tasty nonetheless. Pick of the day fishes were all good.  I had the delicate turbot and my friends had the perch.  All cooked with skill and served with a tasty vegetable hash beneath.   We finished with amazing homemade strawberry shortcake.  Service was attentive and knowledgeable and we lacked for nothing."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night around 8pm. It's a cozy restaurant and we didn't wait too long to be seated. The waitress wasn't the friendliest. She didn't walk us to our table and just pointed to the table and watched us hang our coats. The owner who was also serving at the time was much more attentive and talked about the menu (she was serving the table next to us). She noticed our drinks needed to be refilled and did so whereas our waitress was doing god knows what. So service is a tad inconsistent. Tables are very close so it's easy to hear the conversations next to us. The food was good - we ordered a dozen oysters, seared scallops, mussels and the albacore tataki. Serving sizes are small so I would suggest 4-5 dishes for two people."}
{"text":"Great, energetic and attentive service. Asked for advice on oysters and got helpful straight goods about pairing PEI with BC to get a nice contrast. The BC oysters were tremendous: big, fat, meaty things that my husband compared to mushrooms, with an earthy taste and a real weight in the mouth. The PEI were light, salty-sweet and delicate. Neither needed any condiments. Fresh-tasting, well-chosen, satisfying.   We went simple: my husband had the BC black cod and I had a bowl of steamed mussels. Any fish choices came served over smashed, lightly salted fingerling potatoes and perfectly-done rapini. The cod was buttery and had amazing subtle flavour. No sauce needed: salt and butter. Done. The mussels were as fat and meaty as the BC oysters, in a light lardon-flavoured broth. A side of Ontario-raised shrimp done in browned butter rounded out our order, and we were pleasantly full, not stuffed.   The crisp Norm Hardie \"Honest white\" (a blend of his amazing Calcaire with some others) and the beer from local breweries were great complements.   Really enjoyed. And wasn't as expensive as we anticipated! Honest, indeed -- no unnecessary frills, no pretending to be something it's not. If you like fish, give it a shot."}
{"text":"I have heard about Honest Weight from multiple sources, in particular from a waiter at Chase. I knew that Honest Weight supplied seafood to a plethora of fine restaurants in the city so we had to check it out.   The restaurant was very cozy upon stepping inside. Weirdly, the menu was written on cute little  green chalkboards at the back of the restaurant as the majority of the menu changes frequently based on their seafood availability. We ordered the fish sandwich and scallop mousseline at the bar then got seated.   The fish sandwich made with the fish of the day, rockfish, was delicious and paired perfectly with the housemade dill aioli on a crispy bun and a side of coleslaw. It was seasoned very well. MMmmMMmmMmm :)   The scallop mousseline looked like beautiful food art and was tasty as well. However, my partner ate the entire dish in two bites. For 16 dollars, we expected it to be bigger than 2 inches in diameter from the description. It reminded us of dishes at Alo which my partner believes does not fit with the theme of Honest Weight.  Overall, Honest Weight is a fun and non-pretentious place to go for good seafood. The only downside is that the dishes were overpriced. Fish sandwiches at the Fish Store in College are just as good but are almost half the price. That being said, Honest Weight is a great concept and is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is cozy and unique fish shop/restaurant. The space is relatively small only about 5-6 small tables, but it has a great selection of very fresh seafood, and very knowledgeable server. We had the most amazing fresh oysters and \"pick yer fish\". I picked Porgy, which is a whole fish, but you can pick any fish they have on display (even the large trout whole fish, but that one is by weight and it's $35/lb). The fish was well cooked, with a delicious side of hashed potato and pan seared rapini. Over all, great experience, will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"We had 10 people for my wife's surprise birthday party on Saturday, August 1st.   John and the Honest Weight team totally blew it out of the water. Atmosphere, table settings, beer options, service and every course, including oysters, clam chowder, mussels, whole Ocean trout and curry shrimp, to name some of the highlights, exceeded all expectations. My wife is a tough one to impress and she's still raving this morning.  If your want the best and freshest seafood in Toronto, run don't walk to Honest Weight!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  Best clam chowder I have yet to eat.  Some of the nicest servers working there too.  And such a neat assortment of fish for sale behind the glass.  Worth checking out even if you dont live in the area."}
{"text":"I cannot speak highly enough of this place! The oysters fantastic, the clams delic, the staff hospitable and knowledgeable. And the price just right."}
{"text":"Super cute and quaint place for a casual lunch. Definitely want to go back for the Japanese pancake my friend ordered, it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"A small intimate restaurant that's also a market! The ingredients were fresh and the dishes were simple with incredible flavours. Oysters, shrimps, scallops, Mahi Mahi, black cod... You name it, we had it all! And enjoy every bit of it. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food and cooking, cute space and friendly, caring staff.    BUT Portion size is generally very small and there is confusion about whether a dish is a main or just an appetizer. VERY expensive for what you get.  For example, 4 medium scallops come with a tablespoon or two of pea puree and a couple of pea tendrils for $19 or basically $5 a bite.  That would be fine if there was a side with it or even the option to provide a side.  On the Pick Yer Fish option, you get a piece of fish from the case and a couple of tablespoons of diced potatoes and zucchini.  Given how cheap potatoes and zucchini are, I am left wondering how it can be that the owners are this cheap?  There is no way that this is enough food for a dinner.  There are no appetizer salads or veggie sides available to add for an extra cost either. The only saving grace to prevent you from leaving the place hungry (other than buying two meals) is the BREAD which is fabulous.  Fish cakes were very dry.  The other issue is that they don't take reservations and if you go at standard dinner times you can end up standing there or outside for an hour with no idea of how long it is going to take.  At least they could put a bench in front of the store so seniors or the disabled could sit while waiting?  We found ourselves looking at the coat rack and knick knack shelving that could have easily provided seating for another six, and the monstrous, oversized cold food case for the fish and seafood (with just a few items in it), that took up the space of seating for another 6-8 and wondered why.  Please HONEST WEIGHT....stop being so cheap with the veggies and sides and space!  I'd come more often!"}
{"text":"We buy our seafood here regularly, and the restaurant just brings their fresh seafood flavours to life even more.  I've brought my wife & family here, and refer others here as well.  Best in the city! They also have Ontario shrimp.  :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and it did not disappoint! If you are a seafood lover, this cozy restaurant in the junction is a must try!  The food:  Everything was shared between 2 people.   We started off with a dozen oysters; tuxedo, shigoku and kumamoto. They were all perfectly shucked! The oysters came with 2 wedges of lemon, fresh horseradish, hot sauce and a vinaigrette. My friend was a little disappointed that there weren't more sauces to choose from, but I think that's more personal preference than fault on the restaurant. The oysters were all so fresh that all you really needed was a touch of lemon.   Although they were all so good, we needed to do a second round of the shigoku oysters. Nom noms.   They also had malpeques in stock, but we opted to not eat those as they are commonly found at other restaurants.   The oysters were $3.00 shucked. Definitely worth it.   Next, we had the bouillabaisse. I loved everything about this dish. It came with mussels, clams, shrimp, white fish, this buttery bread with just the right amount of crust that came topped with a red pepper dip/paste, saffron and tomato broth. The whole dish was very light, but filling. The portions were right, but I wish it came with more mussels than clams (also just preference). Those mussels were the best I've ever had!They were really plump and had a nice texture to them. This dish was simply perfection. I will be craving this until we return. The dish costed a well deserved $30.  Finally, the fish sandwich that came with coleslaw on the side + a lemon wedge. Perch, lettuce, tartar sauce all on a buttery fluffy bun. The bun looked like a baguette, but I'll call it a bun since there was no hard crust. I was thinking to myself, how could this top off what we just ate. After the first bite, I knew I had to come back to try more items off the menu. Each ingredient in the sandwich was just the right amount and flavour. Although, you don't get tired of each bite, half of the sandwich was just enough for me. I may order this sandwich again, but likely with a different fish.   They had a nice drink menu that we didn't order off of. I would definitely order a glass of wine the next time I'm back. Being the foodies that we are we went for gluttony over class (there will be more room for food/calories if we don't have alcohol).   The service:  The girls serving us were really friendly and informative about their menu. We arrived before 5pm, so we were told we could order the items off the wall and they will bring it to our table. After 5pm, full dinner service starts. Aside from the ordering, we received full service anyway. The girls came and changed our plates after each \"course\" which I really like (because who wants to mix oyster shell bits with their other food). We had our water refilled without having to ask. Overall, I felt like they were there when they needed to be, and they were away when we needed space. Which is just the kind of service I enjoy during a meal. No one was snobby or pretentious which made us feel very comfortable. The vibe was just right.   The area:  Street parking (green p) is available at a small cost. I think I paid around $2.00. The place I parked is free after 6pm Monday to Saturday.   Overall experience:  If you're craving delicious seafood and down to throw down some money, this is absolutely the place to splurge.  p.s. their menu changes often, so i will be back to try more options. Hopefully the bouillabaisse is still there!  p.s.s stop taking snapchat videos that you can't upload to yelp. Apologies for some of the screenshots of my Snapchat vids! They don't do the food justice, but I still needed to post at least some of them."}
{"text":"Disappointing lunch here. Limited choice at the high end price wise for what you got. e,g, small bowl of thin and unremarkable chowder. Seating mildly uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends who were intent on watching their calories, but not my wallet. This place isn't expensive, not considering the quality of what you get, but it's not cheap, either.   We were somehow able to snag the last table of four without a reservation on a Friday night. The servers were really friendly, particularly one who was back at school and was happy to talk to us about her major in sexual studies whenever she had a moment.   The food is fresh. VERY FRESH. They have a seafood counter, where the server will go through your options for the evening. My group of friends are pedantic jerks, so we appreciate the ability to study the sheen on the skin, the bounciness of the flesh and the clearness of the eyes. We chose the halibut collar, okonomiyaki, the bouillabaisse, and the grilled branzino. EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. NOTHING HAD DAIRY.   We scraped every bit of food off the bones and plates and left happy. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This amazing new combination fish monger/ restaurant/ wholesaler just opened up a block away from me.  I am always on the lookout for fresh, sustainable and esoteric seafood options to keep dinners at home interesting.  On my first visit, I walked away with large bags of razor clams and cherrystones for the most reasonable price I think I've ever paid for seafood. The wonderful counter staff took the time to discuss every aspect of their day's offerings with me, and I left with sincere excitement about what I would be cooking! Upon getting home, I noticed very little sand on the shells, every bivalve was already quite clean. Other than the regular prep one has to do with razor clams, everything only required a simple rinsing before being ready to cook.  All in all, Honest Weight has a simply stunning variety of fresh seafood offerings. Although I haven't dined-in yet, I'm certain that I will. Their menu looks so interesting (they're one of the only places in town that serves okonomiyaki!)  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What an absolute delight Honest Weight is. Laid back and unpretentious with some of the best service and food you'll find in Toronto right now. Attentive and smart servers; clean, fresh flavours. A tight selection of delicious local beers and wines. Run, don't walk, here. And buy some fresh seafood to take home for tomorrow's dinner.  (I have to edit my review as of 2017, because the beer selection at Honest Weight has gone down greatly. They used to offer a selection of local Junction beers but lately it is only garbage Ace Hill and maybe one useless Junction Craft Brewing selection on tap. With so many places opening nearby making tremendous beers - Halo, Rainhard, etc - I am not sure why Ace Hill ever makes it to a menu on the Junction)"}
{"text":"Stopped by because I had a long layover in Toronto and it had good reviews: a solid decision on my part.  I had the Okonomiyaki which is a Japanese egg dish made in the form of a pancake and stuffed with everything delicious: smoked salmon with other assorted veggies and smothered in a fantastic sauce. It's a bit messy, but worth the fumbling through the cutting process.   The oysters were come from different areas of Canada and the two I had were both very fresh. The workers will explain the flavor profiles so you can find the right taste you're looking for.   The space feels like a trendy fish market/small restaurant complete with fresh frozen seafood behind a glass so you can select exactly what you want prepared. It's located in a cute vibrant town that's a lot quieter than the city center."}
{"text":"Owner is extremely nice and helpful! We opted for the $50 grilled whole fish and it comes with deliciously potatoes and well seasoned green beans. It was an interesting shop as you can pick the exact fish you want and have it cooked for you. Food took a while to come, however, even though there are only three tables of diners.   If you are a fish and seafood lover you would enjoy this unpretentious, delightful restaurant."}
{"text":"Ive been here a few times. This last time though was upsetting to me.  few things that happened:  1) the fish dish for 28 bucks - which seems ok of a price if the piece of fish was not minuscule like the one they gave me. They asked me to pick my fish from the options they had and i chose a fillet which looked bigger. Twice as big actually compared to what they gave me. So i feel like there was some false advertising going on. I felt gypped.  2) we ordered a bunch of items - the waitress said \"oh wow you guys have a big appetite\". I really dont need the feedback about our appetite. I know she thought she was being funny and whatever else but it wasnt needed. Probably we had a big appetite cause all the portions we got were small and left us hungry!  3) service was slow. really slow. and the place was half full so not sure what was going on. 4) over all the place is pretty expensive for what you get.  All in all. im not sure I will come back to this place again. Out of all the places out there to go in Toronto now, this place will not be a top list place for me going forward."}
{"text":"Honest Weight is a cute, homey indie seafood restaurant and wholesale in the Junction. It is worth the trek to the Junction for a meal at Honest Weight. The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was casual. It has the feel of your neighbourhood, wood-clad seafood shop where the menu is drawn up on chalkboards.   To start, I had some fresh shuck oysters ($3/eac). They were delicious and fresh - it was like tasting the ocean. For the main, I had the okonomiyaki ($16) which is probably one of the best I had in Toronto. It was savoury. The textures and flavours were on point. The rock fish used in making the okonomiyaki was fresh. For dessert, I had the poached pear with chocolate pudding ($9). It was the perfect way to end a great meal.  I also ordered the homemade sodas ($4) which was quite good.   I would highly recommend Honest Weight if you are a seafood. The prices are a bit high, but you are getting quality food."}
{"text":"Small cozy restaurant with high quality foods. We ordered 6 pieces of oysters only but had them from 3 countries!"}
{"text":"Honestly the best clam chowder I have ever had.  Also, the best Okonomiyaki I have ever tasted.  And when I asked for eel?  They gave me a delicious pickled eel.  My god this is my new favourite place in town.  Have already recommended it to many friends and I will continue to do so till I die.   Also quite a friendly staff working there."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh seafood. I went two times in a month and blown away each time. Very reasonably priced and service is top notch. We had the crudo New England scallops, sealed scallops, grilled whole branzino, tuna tataki, grilled shrimp, and fresh east coast oysters. Everything was so delicious and presented well. Will come back again soon!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to place for a casual night out.  The freshest and most eclectic mix of sustainable seafood available in the city.  They are so well regarded that they supply seafood to most of the best restaurants in the city.  If you think about it like that, why not enjoy the best seafood in the city direct from the source?   Staff are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We were looking for a new spot for seafood and some of the reviews from this place created a mirage in the middle of the asfault desert.  The place smelled so much like not fresh fish, but the beautiful and smiley girl attending in the counter made us trust in the quality of the products, so we ordered a couple of oysters, the Cajun shrimps, and the steamed shellfish.  The oysters from the West Coast were kind of fishy, and they just gave one topping (garlic with vinegar). The oysters from the East Coast felted fresher and we liked them better.  The shrimps were like 4, with 4 pieces of corn, and they weren't fresh at all. It took me minutes to peel them just to loose pieces of valuable shrimp that couldn't get separated from the shell... Buuu...  The bread they provided was really good and was the perfect complement for the shellfish, that I would say is the perfect tapa for having a cold one in this Summer times. It had cubes of bacon and the mussels were really meaty.  Nothing special but the bread and the shellfish.  We would go back just to ask where they buy their bread... And an awesome birdy told me it's from Forno Cultura (609 King West)."}
{"text":"Went there with my daughter who loves oysters. Had a dozen of them, me having a glass of beer and my daughter enjoying ice tea. Very nice people. Would love to come back and try some of their dishes."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Casual, small, great service and fantastic seafood."}
{"text":"Looked up reviews and decided to try this place out. Reviews were accurate! Food and service was great. Seafood was fresh. We didn't try the oysters but will definitely be back for them next time!"}
{"text":"I had the best and freshest fish I've ever eaten. And the chowder was silky. Do your wallet a favour on the wine and order a bottle. Those little $12 glasses add up fast. Highly recommended as a date site. Small and intimate and the service is lovely and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try the fare at the The Honest Weight restaurant today and we were extremely pleased with everything we sampled!  We both had the fish sandwich which is the perfect portion size and the freshest and perfectly cooked fish of the day!  I had a bowl of their chowder and it was equally amazing.  They start you off with a hearty slice each of rustic Italian bread with olive oil (better than butter IMHO) and you have to save some of this wonderful bread to dip into your exquisite chowder-heavenly!  We will DEFINITELY be back to sample other dishes on the compact menu!!!!!!  Bob & Joan"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing. It's our third time here and it doesn't disappoint. The food is just so flavourful. Even the simple things like the bread are so uniquely flavourful. Our favourite is the mussels with a side order of the sour dough bread. The bread just soaks up the mussel juices and takes incredible. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Fresh seafood. Fresh oysters. Choose your own fish! This place has this way cost fish vibe to it. The guy who helped yes looks straight out of hipster Halifax.   But this place is serious about seafood. They have these oysters that I can't say I've tried before from east coast. The seafood chowder is delicious but it doesn't have the creamy texture, so great though.  The best thing I ate? The fish sandwich. Seems they switch out the fish depending on what I guess is fresh. This time, haddock. Super moist, flaky, and absolutely the most delicious fish sandwich I've had.  What else can you get here, if you just want fresh fish to make at home, you can get it here as well. A person came in looking for snapper and had a dish in mind. Staff here asked, well tell me about this dish and then came up with recommendations based on the dish. He was super nice.  Would come back here just to get that sandwich!"}
{"text":"It's in a little bit of a shady neighborhood but the restaurant is so cute and service is nice and the food is good so worth it!"}
{"text":"Small quaint restaurant with friendly staff and fresh food.  Ordered the clam chowder, shrimp roll and fish sandwich  The clam chowder was incredible served with some bread on the side. Probably the best dish out there  Shrimp roll and fish sandwich was great as well.  They do not serve any soft drinks and instead serve drinks that are homemade"}
{"text":"I love Honest Weight. It's a cosy, unpretentious place to get great seafood. Came on a Friday evening around 6 pm and were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. There's limited seating and we weren't sure if we would have to wait (they don't take reservations). Service was pleasant but not overbearing.  We started off with a sea bream crudo - dressed only with olive oil, flecks of sea salt and finely chopped fresh herbs. Simple, yet delicious.  We got the okonomiyaki of the day, made with Ontario rainbow trout and Icelandic cod. It was extremely hearty and filling - unlike other okonomiyaki I've had, it's chock full of fish, shredded cabbage and yam, with just enough batter to hold it all together. It was dressed with kewpie mayo and bonito flakes, which gave the dish a wonderful umami flavour.   Since Honest Weight is a fish shop, there are a variety of fish available for purchase, and they also have a \"pick your fish\" menu option, where you select any fish to be cooked and served to you. We opted for John Dory from New Zealand. It was perfectly seared and served atop a bed of rapini and smashed potatoes.   For dessert, we ordered some kind of vanilla cake pudding baked with maple syrup and served with a side of chantilly cream. It's mildly reminiscent of the maple pudding chômeur that's served at Au Pied de Cochon. Sweet, but not overly so. A nice end to a great meal.   I think the portion size is quite reasonable and food is priced well. I wish it wasn't so far out of the way for me, or I'd come back more often. It's worth the trip, though, for high quality seafood."}
{"text":"Great seafood spot. As mentioned in almost every review, this is a very small place. Seats maybe 15? and if you're going in the winter, you probably won't want to sit at the long bench by the door. We went when the doors pretty much opened, and it was already full. if you come during prime dinner hours (7ish) you might have to wait.  my wife and I probably ordered too much, but that's just how we roll. 2 dozen dozen oysters, clam chowder, mussels, clams, cod tongues, and scallops all had one thing in common. all cooked perfectly (well, not the oysters, but they were delicious too. props to God for making great oysters). not much else needs to be said. With seafood, cooking it right is 80% of the dish. as long as it's fresh, the product will generally speak for itself.  Aside from eating in house, they also have a fish counter where you can buy oysters, clams, fish etc. to take home and cook. I forget how much the oysters were, but i think it was $1.50-$2 per oyster unshucked? That's a pretty good price for proper oysters which included kusshi's and kumamotos. none of that malpeque crap."}
{"text":"Lovely spot in the junction area. Delicious chowder - had the freshest mussel and clams I've ever tried in a chowder. Okonomokiyaki was ok and felt a little too rich / greasy. Definitely will go back and try their other seafood."}
{"text":"So the food and the interior of the restaurant are really good. From the outside you wouldn't think this is a good restaurant but it is. So you may ask, why 3 stars? Well first I can't give 3.5 and in my opinion it doesn't deserve 4 for 2 reasons: It is definitely seriously overpriced and the name fooled me into thinking it would have an honest price..."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our experience here. Our party of 4 arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday and were seated right away. Since it's such a small spot and they don't take reservations, getting here early was a wise decision.   It's a really cute, no-frills space and all the fish and seafood were dynamite. For apps we ordered delicious seared tuna, fried soft shell crab (totally addictive), smoked clams/mussels in a beautiful broth and quality bread with olive oil. For mains we all opted for the \"Pick Yer Fish\" ($28)...I believe there was a good 8 choices or so. All were prepared perfectly! For dessert I tried a maple syrup cakey pudding thing that was also delightful.  Fish and seafood lovers, get your butts over here pronto."}
{"text":"Always amazing, always fresh. We've been here for dinner and to shop the fish counter several times. Our first experience there we were helped by the owner who was really nice and gave us a little white wine so we could cook our mussels at home (we really need an LCBO in the Junction). They have an amazing server there who is always in a spectacular mood and very helpful. Great addition to the hood."}
{"text":"What a delight....  I had some awesome clam chowder here on a cold, snowy day. I also had some of their freshly baked bread that was delicious. More than that, the service was excellent. It is clear that those who serve you here care a lot about fresh seafood and customer service. The place is first class all the way!  They have tables where you can sit and eat, as well as two separate cases-one for shellfish and the other for fresh fish. Oysters are available for 2.50 each shucked and ready for your party, or if you want to tackle them yourself, they are 1.25 each. I mention this because I heard a rumour that the owner/operator here won some big international oyster shucking competition. Big time stuff for The Junction!"}
{"text":"Location: on a main street so parking can be tricky. The outside is neutral in colour, you may miss it if your not familiar and driving by (we did).   Atmosphere: beautifully designed! A fresh feel of the sea with very sleek and clean decor. It has a modern twist to it but does not loose it's ability to exude expertise in there fresh seafood. Beautiful hardwood floors, the inside decor is very detailed from the menu choices, to the vintage cutlery and unique footing of the table legs. Sea shells, and conch shells placed throughout as a little added touch. The space was cozy.   Service: extremely helpful. First time here and I felt very welcomed. They walked through their menu. ( you order at the counter then sit down) very detailed in their description of each plate and took the time to explain just about all the options. They all sounded succulent.   Food: my partner had the scallops and muscles. Very flavourful with the bacon. He loved it ! The bread was delicious and helped to turn down the flavour which is what I liked. My plate was a fish of the day. A fish from B.C. It was cooked nicely. The seasonal vegetables that came with it were delicious and really well cooked.  They have in house made unique soda options for $3.  One option for dessert, but then again your here for the seafood not dessert.   Overall I gave it a 4 because I felt that it was a bit over priced. It is definitely a nice experience and a place to take a seafood lover for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Amazing seafood! Very fresh, great service and atmosphere. My chowder was great with lots of clams. The scallops were done to perfection. The okonomiyaki was unusual and my first time ever having this Japanese dish. The fish stew was excellent in a light tomato broth with lots of mussels."}
{"text":"We ordered a Fish Sandwich, a Crab Legs Cluster, and a Clam Chowder to share.    The Fish Sandwich was excellent.  The texture of the bread felt like a dense croissant. The skin of the bread had a light crunch.  The inside was soft and airy.  The bread tasted very good, too.  The fish fillet used fish of the day, which was rock fish for my order.  The fillet was fresh, tasty and moist.  The toppings and the sauce were outstanding.  The vinegary slaw that came along was a star on its own.  The flavour hit a good balance of sourness and sweetness.  It was a great balance to the buttery bread.  All the parts together made an awesome sandwich.  The portion was adequate as a lunch for one.  It was fairly priced at $15 per portion, quality of ingredients and culinary skills.    The Crab Legs Cluster was very fresh and a great deal to boot.  It was steam cooked just right and presented beautifully on a bed of ice.  The portion was generous for $18 compared to many Canadian restaurants.  If you don't have easy access to live seafood, I recommend ordering the crab legs cluster.  If you do, and you are comfortable with steaming shellfish, this dish is not difficult to cook at home.  The Clam Chowder was creamy and delicious.  Yet we were disappointed that it was mostly cream with 5 to 6 pieces of clams.  At $12, we found it over-priced.  While we placed our name on the waitlist for table, I noticed that there were a few empty tables.  The two waitresses were busy handling food orders.  They didn't clean the tables to move the line for at least 15 minutes.  I think the slow turnover contributes partly to the long wait.  After we had an opportunity to browse the menu, we had to attempt a few times to wave down a waitress to place orders.    The fish sandwich and the crab legs are worthy of 5 stars.  The clam chowder and the slow services brought the rating down a bit. The overall rating is 4 stars."}
{"text":"Have not eaten here as of yet... but I've had the fresh mussels from the retail counter on a number of occasions... best mussels we've ever had, plump and very fresh. What a difference in quality in comparison to the mussels you find at your local grocery store."}
{"text":"my favorite of all the meals we had on a short weekend trip to toronto recently. you MUST love seafood if you come here, there's just no way to avoid it because there is seafood in literally every single thing on the menu.  good thing bf and i are huge seafood fanatics. we ordered oysters, pick yer fish, and gulf shrimp. literally everything was delicious, potentially because copious amounts of butter was used (mmmmmmm).   each dish was completely satisfying, but if i had to pick one as my favorite, i'd have to go with the gulf shrimp. very rarely do i get the joy of eating such plump shrimp that are this big in size. you know it's big when you can easily use a fork and knife to peel the shrimp, rather than using your own fingers. it can be really easy to slightly overcook jumbo sized shrimp, but these were perfect. peel, dip it in lotsa buttah, put in mouth, make stomach happy, and all is right in the world. repeat until all shrimp are gone.  the pick yer fish is a close second. there were something like 5 choices that day and i don't think we could've gone wrong with any of them. trying to be adventurous, we chose a fish that we had never heard of before (unfortunately don't remember the name) - it turned out to be a flaky white fish which is perfect for this type of grilled filet cooking. the grilled veggies and potato also add to the overall flavor of the dish and each bite.  and what can i say about oysters? oysters are oysters - you either love 'em or hate 'em. and we love them! the two types we tried that day were both on the bigger side with a balanced and clean finish.  very intimate but low key setting. excellent service from simply some of the friendliest people around. highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really yummy meal but I deducted a star because 1) it's overpriced and 2) although the service was efficient, there was no warmth at all, which to me didn't fit with the whole neighbourhood-y idea and fun music of the place. Will give it another go to see if they were having an off day. As for the prices..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Great atmosphere, impecable service, cozy and the most important: the food is really good. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Chose this place for a quick lunch in the Junction and it did not disappoint! They sell fresh seafood and also have a decently-sized menu of (seafood) offerings for dining in. Their decor is absolutely charming; elegant but homey. Service was friendly and attentive; our server walked us through their chalkboard menu and was very knowledgeable about it. My friend and I each ordered some chowder, which was accompanied by some fantastic sourdough. The warm and hearty chowder was the perfect panacea for us, having nearly frozen outside on that winter day. We also shared an okonomiyaki, which was all kinds of delicious! A nice mix of fish, cabbage, yam, and those bonito flakes with that amazing sauce -- just perfect. Would recommend to any seafood lover."}
{"text":"Where do I start.... The food was spectacular. So much butter. So much nomz. Simple, fresh food with great flavours. We went for the prawns (the highlight of the meal), squid on an addictive romesco sauce, the clams which I could have done without and the white fish that was seated to perfection. The juices and sodas are also a must try?  The service and ambience really made the lunch perfect. So lovely to chat with waiters and chefs who aren't pretentious and just wanna give you a good time.  This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Great place, foo tasted great and service was prompt. I lived the clam chowder. The beers are also great, I had a craft ale."}
{"text":"Had the Okonomiyaki yesterday for lunch. It was fantastic. I had a taste of the surf clam as well, which was excellent. Fish sandwiches looked like great portions. Hoping to come back to try more!"}
{"text":"First of all this place doesn't take reservations.  When we arrived the server ensured us that we were next in line. However I saw three other parties seated before us. They were visibly confused when it came to seating their customers. In their defense it was mothers day and I'm sure they weren't ready for the volume.   We started off by ordering their sodas (lychee and guava). It was refreshing.  Oysters arrived shortly after (2 kinds from BC and 2 kinds from NB). The ones from BC were some of the best I've ever had. The shuck wasn't the greatest - it wasn't properly detached and shards from the shell were inside.   The clam chowder was just OK. I found it too runny for my liking.  The okonomiyaki was excellent. It delivered on all fronts. The seared garlic shrimp on the other hand was void of all flavor. The pick yer fish was nothing special.   I would go back for the oysters and okonomiyaki. But only if it's not busy."}
{"text":"Aside from the high prices, which are probably a function of seafood in general and the quality of this place, and the slowness for lunch there is nothing to complain about.  Yes, those are issues and cause for concern if you are either on a budget or don't have leisurely time to spend, but the food was fantastic. We arrived for lunch and had to stand and wait behind two folks who were buying seafood. Yes, Honest Weight is a fishmonger, which also has room for seven or so tables for dine-in. The customers and the employee were having a jolly good time discussing fish, contemplating choices and hand picking orders so it took fifteen minutes for us to order our lunch.   They need to have more than one employee servicing seafood buyers and dine-in/take-out clients. It was smooth sailing once we did manage to order lunch however. Moreover, the employee was friendly and apparently knowledgeable. Just to get it out of the way the $18 fish sandwich and coleslaw is expensive and those are PATH prices (but with the speed of ordering this place would die in the PATH in less than a week), but the rockfish was moist, buttery and perfectly seasoned and was wrapped in the perfect soft and tasty bun. The coleslaw was too exclusively cabbagey to be perfect, but wasn't a slouch either. I enjoyed my sandwich and everyone else was enjoying their meal as well. It sure tasted fresh (as well as delicious) and the presence of fresh seafood in the fridge helps one trust the offering. With that said, they should change the wallpaper. It depicts an old time fishmonger selling seafood for 15 cents a kilo. I paid $18 for a sandwich and coleslaw (and it was only rockfish) and was pouting looking at those olden prices.  For those interested in buying seafood, the display had a limited selection of shrimps, oysters and fish as well. The prices are higher than seafood markets and St. Lawrence Market, but for those who are here to dine or live close-by Honest Weight apparently does not scam its customers weight-wise!"}
{"text":"I love that they stock a lot of environmentally responsible seafood -- including Ontario shrimp (grown, I believe, on a disused pig farm)! And I like that the selection of fish (and the fish of the day) changes depending on availability. I cannot comment on it as a fish market, except to say that I've seen types of fish for sale there that I've never seen anywhere else and that the fish in their cooked food tastes very fresh.   I love the okonomiyaki here, and I'm Asian. I think about it more times than I'd like to mention. Seriously, you want to get it. Be aware that portions are a little small; me and my fella usually split 3-4 things between us, though he is a pretty big eater.  Also, they have a reputation for treating their staff well (compared to other restaurants), if you care about that sort of thing."}
{"text":"John is doing excellent things here.  Toronto's lucky to have him spend some time here with us.  The gypsy of the water protein world, John's time in Toronto will probably not be long, but if you're reading this review, you should take advantage of it now. Just go there and be wowed by yourself. Don't hold back and just ask John what you should and shouldn't be eating. He's honest to a flaw. Be ok with the fact that you're going to wait for a table."}
{"text":"came here with some friends on a wednesday night, only had one table occupied, and was served quickly. Ordered the ceviche, clams and okonomiyaki to start for three people, just incase it wasn't good. Our food came out really fast, service was friendly, and within 5 minutes we were ordering our second round of food - consisting of clam chowder, shrimp and whelks toast (this is a must order). Their menu changes daily, and things can sell out quick (i.e. the fish board), so make up your mind quick. Based on the quality of the fish, you would expect to pay far more than what they charge. Can't wait for our next visit out!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but Ridiculously Overpriced  Well, what about paying $80 for lunch for three people? Sounds like a fancy restaurant... We paid $125, for lunch at Rodeo Dr., in Beverly Hills, and it felt fair... The eatery in the Junction area... sounds definitely an overkill... quite a bit.  We had a lunch at the Honest Weight, ordered seared scallops, fish sandwich and chowder. Scallops were good, but not something exquisite. Charging $19 for three and a half (not joking) scallops probably possible in the chef's restaurant, but then a plate would be perfectly presented. Here was nothing else on the plate besides scallops, just few miniature slices of chili. The fish sandwich $16, wasn't bad, but with the same success it could cost $12, there wasn't anything outstanding. It was falling apart at the bottom.   The chowder comes in a very small bowl, $12, should've been less than half, considering that it was very light, no fish, just few small mussels and pieces of veggies... Two slices of bread, top burned very much.  Finally, charging $8 for a pint of local beer, the brewery is literally a block away is way too bold.  Just wondering, who was that critic raving about the food at the Honest Weight? Must've been drunk or something... Just kidding..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in the city for fish. No-nonsense, fresh, tasty, and great value. We ordered the Japanese style pancake, steamed mussels, and whole steelhead and were not disappointed. My only complaint is that they're located so far out of the way."}
{"text":"We randomly happened upon this restaurant online just before a movie. We had oysters followed by two main courses. Both were delicious and I can't recommend this restaurant enough!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch today visiting Toronto.  What a surprise.  The chowder, oysters and Japanese pancake were amazing.  Staff very friendly.  Five stars no doubt!"}
{"text":"We dropped in for dinner on a Saturday night.  Since they do not take reservations, we waited about 15-20 min. for space to clear at the bar for our group of four.  The menu is simple and displayed on a few chalkboards.  We decided to get the chowder ($12), okonomiyaki ($16) and the fish sandwich ( $15) with 2 pints of local Junction Brewery beers ($8) for two of us.  The other pair ordered the scallops ($16), ceviche ($13) and the fish sandwich.  Food came quickly starting with the chowder, served with the most divine, hearty bread.  The chowder itself was full of sea creature goodies and left me wanting a much larger bowl than was served.  The fish sandwich - bun was super soft and fresh, could have used a bit more fish content but overall tasty.  Came with a small side of coleslaw.  Okonomiyaki was very filling and a good portion.  Although it was very busy in the restaurant with groups coming and leaving, the service was always pleasant and attentive.  We never felt rushed and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.    Would gladly come back for lunch and that heart warming chowder!  A great addition to the Junction area!"}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday, and they were out of most of their fresh fish so options were limited. The owner/server was super apologetic and friendly, and made recommendations for us. The clam chowder was super creamy (pretty much all cream, if you're into that). The steamed seafood was amazing, especially with the bacon infused broth. They also have local beer from Junction Brewery down the road which paired decently with the seafood. The oysters were also fresh and reasonably priced. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I can only speak to the service and quality here when I come to pick up fish to cook at home. Everyone super lovely. Exceptional fresh fish - was told one day to come back after 2pm when the'd get their delivery. They obviously take pride in what they do and sell. Been here a half dozen times and never disappointed. Won't go to Snappers ever again!"}
{"text":"Quite expensive for the portion sizes but quite good and well executed as well.   The service staff is nice and the chief often comes to bring food and discuss about it with customers. The Canadian-adapted okonomiyaki (less flour, less okonomiyaki sauce, less mayo, more onions, plus fried bacon and salmon) is interesting and surprisingly very good! Seafood is always perfectly cooked, melting and tasty.  As it is closed on Mondays, I guess the best days to go there are more Tuesdays and the following days for more/maximum of choices for fish and seafood, rather than on Sundays."}
{"text":"I stepped in here the other day without knowing much about it at all and was greeted by a completely unassuming and utterly mellow guy in a toque behind the counter. He walked me through the menu and I settled on the $20 pick yer fish option and was directed towards the Pickerel, something I had never had, as I am a seasoned West Coaster. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting that much from a lake fish and my Pacific Ocean bias has always told that ocean fish was where it's at. I am super happy to say that I was proved very wrong. The fish was presented to me perfectly pan fried atop a small pile of rapini, and flanked by pan seared fingerling potatoes drizzled with salsa verde. When I bit into the fish, the synapses in my brain were firing off saying 1) lake fish is insanely delicious and you were a fool to ever think otherwise and 2) don't you ever doubt a mellow man in a toque again (because, you know, there are just so many out there). To round out my meal, I also requested 4 of their oyster varietals and a cherry soda. All were exceptional. I have dreamt of this meal every day since I left its doors and I vow to return soon.  PS - after I left, I found out that the man in the toque is the legendary restauranteur, John Bil (whom I once read a couple of awesome things about) My admiration for the man has exploded exponentially to fan-girl levels knowing just how low key and rad of a guy he is in person."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Junction! The chowder is out of this world - creamy, yet light full of plump pieces of mussels, shrimp and clams. I could have had two bowls of the stuff. For lunch, we also ordered 2 of their classics: the fish sandwich and the okonomoyaki. I thought the the fish sandwich was fresh and good, but not memorable. The okonomoyaki on the other hand was so good. I've had okonomoyaki in Japan, but this one might actually surpass all of my prior okonomoyaki experiences! A must try. The restaurant itself is small, warm and cozy. We went on a chilly but sunny fall day, and it was so nice to sit by the windows with the sunlight streaming.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This a a real seafood restaurant. I loved Jons restaurant in PEI and was glad that he landed in the junction.   Very fresh and simply prepared seafood. Scallops are excellent, and really any other fish that is there. Great fish cakes and chowder. Also very nice oysters although could use a few more accompanying sauces.   Good beers on tap but a very limited wine list.   Staff is very friendly and knows seafood very well.   Always enjoy coming here although it's not always easy to get a seat.   Lastly, the place is not cheap by any measure , but the quality of seafood is worth it."}
{"text":"Quaint little seafood shop that sells both fresh and prepared seafood. We came here and tried the chowder ($9) and the okonomiyaki ($13), along with the complimentary bread.  The chowder was simply amazing. I was skeptical at first because $9 for a chowder is a bit much considering the portion size, but the generous amount of whole clams and mussels in the chowder changed my mind. The chowder is also very rich in flavour and not too heavy with cream. The okonomiyaki was good too, but personally I can't eat too much okonomiyaki without feeling a bit sick after, so splitting this with a friend was just perfect. There was chunks of fish in the okonomiyaki and a roll of smoked salmon on top, so if you're not much of a shell fish lover I would recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Disappointing but has potential. Overpriced for the quality of food, portions and service particularly the subpar wine for 12 a glass. Not making me want to come back. The bread is wonderful so maybe stick to the sandwich if you go? With some changes could be good."}
{"text":"I had take out from here, it's relevant.  I called ahead, super nice people walked me through my options, I chose the fish sandwich and a haddock plate with veg. They timed it out so it was hot and ready (held off a minute before cooking it while I raced over). It seems very nice and cozy inside, like a ship but with a sweet leather bench.   They don't do fish and chips, it struck me as odd, maybe because the fish is arguably ruined once deep fried, they're serving very fresh high quality, still a little weird for such a staple. By no means does this affect their review.   I got back, the fish sandwich was delicious and a good size (~8\"), good distribution of toppings to fish ratio, with a nice side of coleslaw but..$18, a little steep.   The fish plates' presentation was ruined in the takeaway container and the portion, a little smaller than expected, it was...all right, poor value for $24.   TL;DR Reasonable to good food, cool people, nice atmosphere, $$$ for portions, don't take away."}
{"text":"Honest Weight accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do. Very high quality fish, freshly prepared and presented in a simple (but tasty) manner.  The fishcounter has a changing selection of very good quality fish which they will promptly prepare for you. There are other options on the menu but most items are fairly simple - which is a good thing in this case.  If you are coming for oysters, note that the selection is small but they are among the best I have had in Toronto.   It is not inexpensive but on par for any other restaurant in the city preparing good quality seafood. I'm lucky I don't live closer or else I would probably end up here far too frequently."}
{"text":"Came by this place by accident and oh boy are we glad we did!  We were served by lovely Helen....  thank you HELEN! If you are a seafood lover and appreciate the experience look no further. The food is so delicious and the service is world class."}
