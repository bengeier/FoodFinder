{"text":"We visited Brassaii during Summerlicious this year and their selections were fabulous. Prior to ordering our meals, we focused our attention on their specialty cocktail list which featured several special mixed drinks and Caesars. I wish we could have tried them all. Instead, I settled for a tasty Gin Caesar topped off with a slice of cucumber and a grape tomato; while my date enjoyed a Balsamic Bramble: a sweet mixture of gin, chambord, and champagne crested with some fresh fragrant berries.

Chowing down for dinner after taking the edge off; I ordered a sweet flavoured vichyssoise topped with a chive creme fraiche as my appetizer; sirloin steak frites served perfectly to my liking with a sensational chimichurri sauce that sent a wave of excitement through my taste buds accompanied by perfectly seasoned Yukon fries; and although I normally pass on dessert; I, thankfully, let the temptation of their dark chocolate raspberry delice overtake my sanity to perfectly cap off my dining experience.

My date enjoyed two crab cakes served with curry aioli and mango salsa as her appetizer which looked very tasty, and I suspect they were SO tasty, and that that was probably the reason I wasn't even afforded a nibble. Her entree was a filet of baked salmon seared to pink perfection, with a pureed mash of wasabi potato and fennel, presented elegantly next to a julienned citrus salad; and, as her sweet tooth is always stimulated, this time she enjoyed an almond butter cake topped with freshly sliced strawberries and a Brassaii specialty their home-made basil ice cream.

All in all, I definitely would'nt hesitate to recommend Brassaii. It's a true neighbourhood gem that isn't as hard to find; it's located just 100 metres west of Spadina Avenue on the south side of King Street West."}
{"text":"This morning I decided to give Brassaii a try for breakfast because I heard their pastries were fabulous. When I walked in I immediately saw freshly made almond croissants which I could not resist. I decided to take a half dozen back with me to the office and they ended up being a huge hit. Without a doubt I will be a return customer."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great things about this place!  Had my company's Christmas party here last year and they were very accomodating to our needs.  The hor d'oeuvres were delicately delightful!  Dinner was served on schedule and even though everyone had a different dish, no one had any complaints.  Beyond the room we were seated in... little did we know how insanely busy the rest of the venue was.  When our event finished, we mingled briefly in the rest of the restaurant and the upscale crowd and music provided a great overall feeling.  Also a great place to pop into in the week for dinner.  Almost a French Cafe-Italian Bistro kind of feeling in there.  Menu has some great selections.  Their kitchen is very accomodating with allergies.  If you're not familliar with the area, you might walk right by the place.  It's tucked away, just keep your eyes open and your stomach prepared for an elegant meal :)"}
{"text":"We booked our parents 50th wedding anniversary at Brassai and signed a contract.  We booked months ahead, and had 60 people confirmed to attend.  Brassai called 3 weeks before the party and canceled because they had booked a larger party!  So be warned that if you have a party booked at Brassai, they will cancel if they get a better booking.  We had to scramble and miss work to find an alternate location.   I will say that Brassai offered us $500 in compensation for our trouble, but it didn't begin to cover it.  Stay away from Brassai for parties because they can cancel on you at any time."}
{"text":"What a bunch of pretentious group of sinfully ugly people waiting in line to pay 5x markup on booze.  I've never seen a bigger group of suckers, the place must print money and laugh all the way to the bank.  Pass on this nonsense folks.  Take it from someone that parties in NY and LA, this is a joke."}
{"text":"Went to Brassaii for a birthday party few months back. Will definitely not go back.  Customer service is horrible and they are not accommodating at all! Friend had good chunck of money stolen out of her wallet and when it was being investigated Brassaii was not helpful at all."}
{"text":"Living in the downtown core, you'd think there would be an endless supply of breakfast nooks that could easily satiate those blurry-eyed lazy Sunday morning stomach growls.  Truth is though, that there may only be a few good ones; don't let the line outside Cora's fool you folks, you aren't missing much by opting out and choosing even Timmies around the corner.  So when I finally was pointed towards \"an amazing brunch place on King\" I was as excited as I was cautious to try it.  Simply, Brassaii's brunch is amazing.  The menu has all the breakfast staples; eggs Benny, pancakes, frittatas, all with their own unique little twists, but not so twisty that they take away from that traditional breakfast feel -- French toast with lemon Ricotta cheese, uuummmmm. Brassaii is not a greasy spoon, and it's pricing is reflective of that, but it definitely has a funky feel, and am told it's just about to undergo some extensive renovations that will make it even funkier! Sadly, as a consequence, I will be losing my new favourite breakfast spot for about a month.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here several times and it was always very good. I love both the interior space as well as the patio. The service has always been very good and fast."}
{"text":"To start with the good thing: food was good. I had a nice salad (with too little sauce) and then a beef, which was fine tasting a well cooked.

Now the bad thing. we were a group of 24 people and had reserved for 26 people (2 couldn't participate at the end). we were forced to pay for 26 people, even if we didn't have the food of them. and - important to mention - the restaurant was only half full! we had to speak with the manager, but he didn't wanted to understand - he insisted to pay for all reserved people.

To be honest - never heard something like this!!!

In addition, service personal was ok, but not on the level I expected to be. Our waiter behaved many times very strange, very uneducated and unpolite."}
{"text":"Went there for a friend's birthday party on Saturday, reservations were for 12 people @945. 

1. Got there and was told that the table wasn't ready yet. That's fine didn't mind waiting a few minutes to be seated. Didn't get seated until about 1045

2. Waiter seemed overwhelmed and he was not very patient.  If you can't handle a large group, don't take the table. We sat at the table for about 20 minutes before he even came to get our drink orders. It was faster to go to the bar. 

3. Food didn't come until about 12 and by that time we  had already been sitting for almost 1.5 hours. The only Saving grace was that the food was decent. A bit expensive but good.

Summary, brassaii needs to decide if it's going to be a club or a restaurant, doing both is not working out for them. TOO many people in such a small space. And the staff is not as good because the servers Know that no matter how bad the service is, the gratuity is included in the bill for 8 or more people. So they don't care that you are sitting and waiting.  over not a good experience and not worth the price.Way over rated and over hyped."}
{"text":"We came here in a huge group and spent quite a lot of money, which in my opinion was not worth it at all. The food was not bad but considering the price it was not nearly as good as it should've been (really salty/nothing special). We had dinner and then stayed, we got bottle service and all in all spent a few thousand dollars between all of us, the staff was rude the people at the door were so incredibly snobby. Someone needs to tell them that they work there and that their work is to provide service not to bully people. I would never go back."}
{"text":"A colleague and I walked in for lunch and ordered the Triple S which we both thought was fantastic. The Triple S is a $9 food combination of soup, salad and a sandwich. The service was friendly, fast and the venue was filled with charm and good taste. I will be sure to keep this gemstone in mind the next time I have a business lunch or dinner to reserve."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Brassaii before and found the food to be excellent. The service was just okay then, but I was at the bar which more often than not means sketchy service. 

Tonight, my girlfriends and I met at Brassaii for drinks on the patio (yay heat!)  We were the only people there at 6pm and, even though reservations at the table weren't until 7:30pm, we were still told we had to sit at the patio bar. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying because we would have been gone by then. Our waiter was the absolute worst -- even though we all ordered drinks and were the only people there, he was not at all helpful and was actually quite rude when we asked whether they could prepare drinks not on the menu.

Speaking of the Brassaii bar menu, it's practically non-existent.  There were literally eight cocktails from which to choose, none of them \"summery\", and most of them were so old school (think Tom Collins and Sidecars) that seniors and their very senior parents would have nursed them, but not thirty-something girls in the city. Their wine list contained all of zero Canadian wines, which we found surprising.

After waiting for our server to ask for our bill (we ended up having to ask the bartender to go hunt him down), he still carried out two more trays of drinks before bringing it to us.

All in all, it was definitely not the best I've ever had, especially considering my visit prior.  Something was definitely off at Brassaii tonight -- too bad it was my night to go!"}
{"text":"Went here three weeks ago
Chicken was great and the music was awesome
I was with two other girlfriends for a ladies night out
What we did not like was the the photographer clearly avoiding our table and discriminating with who they were taking pictures off
Total turn off
My husband and I used to love coming here for brunch but will not anymore especially since I had called a couple of days after trying to talk to a manager and no one called me back"}
{"text":"I came here with a big group of girls and although this place is a little pricey - It totally worth it!

I had the chicken dish for main and it was cooked beautifully, The restaurant is super cute and has such a beautiful ambient atmosphere. The whole place is candle lit and oh so romantic it would be an amazing place to go for a special anniversary or a date night. 

Our server was amazing and she made every effort to ensure our drinks were topped up and food was to our liking.

I cant wait to return, this place really is 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Brassaii was very disappointing, despite its surprisingly good reputation.  

I wouldn't normally go for dinner to a place that sells itself as a club, simply because it is difficult to deliver a great service both as a club and a restaurant, but this being a friend's birthday it was a special occasion. 

We were greeted warmly and within the first couple of minutes they offered us champagne and wished my friend a happy birthday. Our host was very nice and polite. 

We had dinner and a bottle of wine and then ordered dessert. As soon as we placed the order for dessert, the floor manager came to our table and rudely asked us to leave  within 10 minutes. When we asked why, he said they have a cap on the amount of time you are allowed to stay. My friend explained that when she made the reservation they did not inform her of this limit. His reaction to this was \"they must have told you\", so clearly we must have been lying. This is a very uncomfortable situation, and clearly discussing it further would only ruin the celebration. We simply said \"We were not aware of this and  just ordered dessert\". The answer to this just proves how poor the culture of this restaurant really is: \"Oh I didn't know that! In this case you have 15 minutes to finish it\". 

We canceled the order,  they brought it anyway, though the manager never came back to speak to us.

The funniest part, which would most likely have gone unnoticed had it not been for the manager's eagerness to kick us out was that we were charged ($1/glass) for the champagne that was offered to us in the beginning (and which we did not order). The amount is insignificant yet the move is cheap.  

Building a respectable business and delivering great service is absolutely doable. Many places have done this. Brassaii is simply not interested in customer satisfaction.   A manager that addresses a guest like a bouncer can simply not live up to the expectations of a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, but this should be written. I went to Brassaii on a Friday. The dinner service was fantastic. No complaints there. It was a little empty which was odd for 6-8pm, but the food was amazing. The staff were the perfect balance of friendly and professional. The venue is gorgeous. 
I was put on the VIP guest list and returned around 11:30pm. I had two drinks inside, and one on the patio. I couldn't smell any alcohol in the first two, and a hint in the last one. The bartender told me vodka naturally tastes like water. So I tried rum. I left a while later completely sober. I've heard of drinks being water down but this is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I had a high expectation from this unique spot. Although the food was good (not spectacular), the service was awful. Aside from the girl who greeted us at the entrance, the rest of the staff were terribly rude. We (a group of 8. )were there for a saturday brunch and all were completely disappointed."}
{"text":"My review is based upon the events that transpired this past Saturday, October 31st, 2015.
My girlfriend and I and a second couple purchased four tickets at $20 each for Brassaii's Halloween party online well in advance of the 31st. As long time patrons of your restaurant and nightclub we knew that the event would be a good one and we looked forward to partying there. As things turned out, nothing can be further from the truth. Even though we arrived at a reasonable time (11:00 pm) with tickets in hand, there was a huge crowd of people waiting to get inside. I would estimate that at least 100 people were waiting in line and the vast majority had pre-purchased their tickets. As we progressed closer to the gentlemen working the line, the waiting crowd was told that the club was at capacity and nobody else was getting in DESPITE HAVING TICKETS. The shameful thing is that as the large volume of people waited, several others were leaving the club and at this point the \"gentlemen\" working the line were seen several times taking $30 a head in cash from people that had ALREADY PRE-PAID $20 a ticket so they could by-pass the line. So, even though my group had already paid $80 for tickets, we were forced to wait an hour in cold, damp, rainy weather and the only way to get in was to dish out another $120 to the bouncers who were obviously pocketing the money. Also, if the club was so full, why were those willing to grease the bouncers allowed entry? After being drenched for one hour as well as being mis-treated by your bouncers we were forced to leave and have now lost $80 in entry tickets that were not even scanned. Again, as long time patrons of your club my group finds all of this very unprofessional and highly disorganized. It is clear your club over-sold tickets which forced many people to wait outside in the cold and rain. This further led to your bouncers cashing in from those who were willing to be taken advantage of. After this mess we will not be visiting your establishment again and we will be sure to share this story with the many friends and associates we have the next time they consider visiting Brassaii. 
I am in the process of explaining this situation to management and am requesting a refund. I will advise how that turns out.
**** just an update that when i emailed the club the next day and advised them of the whole situation they were extremely apologetic and took my concerns seriously and promised me a refund which i have just received and were quick and professional with resolution - just wanted to give the whole story **** i went from a 1 to a 2 star for that reason - thanks to manager Diego Rupolo for his help"}
{"text":"I like the food here.  I've been a few times, most recently for a Winterlicious dinner, and I've never been disappointed.  The ambiance is a bit lacking, though--the space is huge, which amplifies the voices of fellow diners, and the crowd it attracts seems to be more interested in photographing themselves and their food than in actually eating.  It's pretty obnoxious, actually.

Brunch is a far better option."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! 
Great service, awesome atmosphere, and great food. 

Eggs Benedict are a MUST here! Steak frites are also really good. I first discovered it as part of Winterlicious a few years ago. It was a real standout and I haven't forgotten how great it was!"}
{"text":"Went to Brassai this past friday with a couple friends...real cool vibe music was on point and great for people watching ...atmosphere is real laid back...love the place."}
{"text":"Waited 15mn on the patio while 3 bar tenders were chatting together... Never got any drink menu or service. We just left. Worse service in toronto... I forgot to mention... There was only the 2 of us sitting on the patio and waiting for a drink...."}
{"text":"Beautiful place with excellent service, good wine, and very bland food, at least for our Winterlicious visit. Service was fast and considerate. None of the courses were exciting, and some were frankly disappointing. It did have free wi-fi and a great deal of style both in terms of decor and presentation, but the same taste was not reflected to the palate."}
{"text":"Ein angemessenes Frühstück in einer nordamerikanischen Stadt zu finden ist zeitweise schwierige Sache.


 Das Brassaii zeigt, dass es auch anders geht. Leckere Omelette und Pancakes vereinfachen den Start in den Tag.


 Nicht beurteilen kann ich das Lokal für Mittag- und Abendessen. Die preislich sehr vernünftigen Menus wechseln regelmässig und machen einen Besuch auch zu einer anderen Tageszeit mal zu einem Muss."}
{"text":"I came here for a late dinner after a meeting nearby. 

The restaurant was a lot larger than i expected.  There was an open kitchen at the back, and a two sided bar that double as a room divider to make the space less open. 

We came in on a thrusday night and was surprised at how quiet it was. 

Food was very good.  
The service was attentive overall. 

I will return if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Went to Brassaii with my family for Sunday morning brunch. Side note, brunch is the best of all of the meals. I had the smoked salmon rosti. This is basically a twist on eggs benedict. It is poached eggs with smoked salmon (instead of ham), a potato rosti (instead of english muffin) and hollandaise sauce. It also had a nice little herb aioli on the side. I really enjoyed this dish and it definitely is a nice change from eggs benedict. 

I have now been to Brassaii a few different times, for brunch and dinner. I have always enjoyed the food, the service is always good and, as some others have commented before me, the crowd is fairly attractive/trendy.   If you are looking for more than just some good food then I would suggest Brassaii. It really does have a cool, hip, trendy atmosphere...even at 12 pm on a Sunday."}
{"text":"This would be my second visit to Brassaii, once over the summer where I dined out on their patio and more recently inside since they had renovated. Quite frankly I really wanted to like this place and had to wait until I re-visited before I wrote a review since my first experience didn't wow me. Sadly it still didn't wow me on my second visit either.

On my most recent visit we dined in the lounge area for drinks and light dinner fare, we only tried the Charcuterie Board and the Rabbit Risotto. The Charcuterie Board I swear came straight from the deli at a local grocery chain, not adventurous and the whole time I was thinking I could have put this together myself at home with jarred olives and sliced meats and cheese. The Risotto wasn't bad but far from the best I've had.

In my observation, this is a place more to be seen than to dine, and the same goes for the waitresses as their friends came in and out and had drinks at the bar which took away the attention of the wait and host staff for most of the time I was there. In one instance we had ordered another round of drinks which never came and every time I tried to get the waitress's attention she was too busy chatting up with another waitress. It wasn't until she came over to check on us (maybe a good 20 min later) til I forcefully mentioned that we're still waiting on our drinks which then she apologized dearly for forgetting."}
{"text":"Strap in, because this is going to suck.

My first experience at Brassaii took place around the start of September, sort of smack in the middle of the TIFF festivities, so maybe it had something to do with the experience. It was my girlfriend and I's 7th anniversary and we wanted to try a new place, so off we went.

With reservations confirmed we arrived at the restaurant to be greeted at a makeshift podium in front of a large party happening on the patio. The hostess and her colleague then debated for a few minutes; do we walk these people through the large party, or use the side entrance so we don't disturb the party in progress. 
Eventually they decided the side entrance was the way to go. So off we went down the alley, squeezing around partitions, recycling bins, garbage bags and puddles of urine to arrive at the side entrance.

On arrival at the side door, some management type figures stood, who looked curiously at the host and the two of us. In hushed tones, the host tried to explain that he was told to bring us to the side entrance so as not to disturb the party. 

Now, had I been the management person standing there here is what I would have said to the host: 'We really shouldn't do that, it doesn't look good on the restaurant. Bring them in just now, but don't bring anyone else down here, okay?'

Here is what was said to the host: 'No. Take them back around.'

On our journey back to the front past the debris and piss puddles I turned to my girlfriend and said 'Already a great start.'

So, after pushing through the party on the patio we arrived inside, were promptly seated (beside a curtained-off room where staff were constantly passing through) and offered a complimentary glass of Prosecco in recognition of our celebration. This was a nice touch. Our waiter came by and asked if we would like any beverages, which were delivered to us promptly.

At this point, we believe something terrible happened to our waiter. He was either kidnapped or had fallen through a rift in space and time, because he was entirely lost to us. It had been 35 minutes since we had been seated until my girlfriend had to physically stop a staff member and ask for a waiter. 

A few minutes later we were greeted by a very nice waiter who asked that we 'please do not feel forgotten', even though we kinda sorta were. A lot. We ordered our meals (duck 2 ways for her, and steak cooked medium for me[remember that part because it comes back later]) and my girlfriend asked for a glass of merlot with dinner. 

The nice waiter reappeared moments later. 'I'm very sorry, we're actually out of merlot. Would you care for a cabernet perhaps?' 
'Sure, thank you.'

I kind of felt bad for the guy at this point; I've been a waiter before and it's awful compounding bad news on top of bad news.

Moments later: 'I'm very sorry, we're actually out of that as well; we're between red wine suppliers at the moment.'

He ended up scrounging up my girlfriend some sort of red coloured wine-like drink from somewhere. At this point, my girlfriend and I were actually laughing at how abysmally incapable this restaurant seemed to be run.

Finally, dinner arrived. Girlfriend said her duck was delicious. And then there was my steak. Remember how I said 'cooked medium'? Upon cutting into the steak, the blood began to pour so readily I was convinced the chef was actually making a sacrifice to Q'uq'umatz (feathered snake god and creator to the Mayan people). 

My girlfriend said stated the obvious; 'Why not send it back?' I did not for two reasons. 1) The kitchen was busy enough that I was certain it would be thrown on the grill and forgotten about, and 2) there was a good chance I would just plain be forgotten about again. 

Our waiter arrived again, trying to make amends by offering us a complimentary round of drinks. We politely turned him down. 
The first time.
On the third time he offered a complimentary drink I said 'You've given us Prosecco, a full glass of red wine, and now you want to offer ANOTHER drink?' He seemed to understand at this point how silly the drink offer was.

Without having dessert we paid the bill (my 1 bottle of water was graciously taken off of the bill) and ran screaming from the restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time coming, first experience was alright ... Not the greatest..

Today the service was excellent. Quick, responsive, friendly. The food came out speedy. It was excellent. Drinks were great. Atmosphere is excellent. The music not to loud.

Young professional crowd. Friendly but upscale. Lovely."}
{"text":"Service - 0/5

IT WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT!

Friend held a birthday dinner there last Friday, made reservation for 20 people for 9pm. First table of 10 showed up at 9 and got seated. 5 minutes later, hostess came up and said if our other party is not showing up in the next 5 minutes, we will lose our table.

Our other party showed up 45minutes late due to traffic and car problems. By 10:15pm, no waiters have served the other table. One of the friends from the other table interrupted a waiter and asked to be served, the waiter said you guys are late so you have to wait for your turn. 

By 10:45pm, still no waiter to be found. So one of the friends decided to speak to a manager, who chatted for about 15minutes and wasn't helpful at all. At 11pm, no one served the other table and finally a white bald guy approached the table and said kitchen is about to be closed, please order soon. We replied informing him that there is no waiter serving us. To our surprise, the white bald guy (who is apparently the general manager and owner) said that's because you guys are late and was very rude about it.

By 11:15pm, we all walked out leaving half of the group starving. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"My first time at this club with a group of girlfriends for a birthday celebration.  We were told cover is free before 11, but were charged $20 around 10:45pm.  Not a big deal. My friend was the one who called, in the future get on a guest list (we were unaware of it) and you should be covered before 11:30p.  This place filled up quick on a Saturday night.  We were there early, so we were able to get a regular table for the night. We chatted with the manager about how much we loved the place and he got us a round of drinks - awesome! His name is Orlando, nice guy. If you have any issues I would suggest speaking to a manager. Dress code is in full effect, ladies can get away with flats, sandals, etc. Overall, great club, awesome music on a Sat night, but extremely packed at peak times. Expect to be brushed or stepped on! Unforgettable lounge!!"}
{"text":"Participating in Winterlicious again this year, I booked a table at Brassaii for dinner. I enjoy going out to nice places for dinner so Winterlicious is a great time to sample what restaurants have to offer. I've heard good things about Brassaii (as both a restaurant and a nightclub) I wanted to see for myself.

Food Quality & Price: $45 Prix Fixe Menu. It's on the pricey side and the Winterlicious menu selection was slim. Lamb shank and Sole? Kind of stingy imo. 


Appetizer (Prosciutto) - Delicious! Slightly too much mozzarella for the amount of meat (it was about half a round!) but it did not take away from the taste. The crab toast was also good but must be hand held (makes kind of a mess).

Entree - Choice of Filet of Sole, Lamb Shank and Agnolotti (almost like a ravioli stuffed pasta). The pasta did not sound adventurous enough and we were informed that the sole would be deep fried. So our entire table of eight ordered the Lamb Shank.  Easily the best part of the meal. The meat was fall off the bone and very juicy. Everything down to the sauce was amazing. Compliments to the chef on this dish, our group was very pleased.

Dessert - The chocolate cake tasted very similar to a Two-bite brownie. Only 1 of our 8 ordered that. Everyone else was very satisfied with their strudel or puff pastry. Can't go wrong with either. Both were fluffy, not too sweet and beautifully presented.

Facility: Loungey atmosphere. Dimly lit for a romantic atmosphere but had trouble reading the menu in the dark. Washrooms were clean but TINY. I would avoid bringing your purse in. 

Service:  We were greeted by the hostess and then put our items in coat check. There was a blizzard that day and most of our party arrived about 15 minutes - 20 minutes late for the reservation (2 dropped out). Upon arrival, the location was pretty dead (as expected due to the weather). However, during our stay, we were reminded by our server, Maja, on multiple occasions that because of how fully booked they are, they would only be able to accommodate us for the 1.5hr limit from the reservation time. We were rushed through dinner (though food was great). At around 8pm, the place was still fairly empty (I would say about 60 - 70% empty) and was reminded again that we would need to make room for others. In the end, the \"other party\" was late (or a no show, we never saw them), so we ended up staying until 8:30pm. The wait staff took their time to get our bills and struggled to divide them evenly among us. I was not very impressed by the service. Easily rated that service a 2/5. 

Overall: Brassaii struggled to reach my expectations and I was somewhat pleased with the experience. Food was great but everything else was rather mediocre. I do not think I would return."}
{"text":"Went just this Friday night and I want to clarify that the 5 stars are for the dining experience. We had an amazing server who mentioned that the prep time would be a little lengthy but worth it. He was right! The food arrived 45 minutes later but the tagliolini and chicken were perfect! The tagliolini had a sauce on top that I wish I had on hand to keep adding to the plate! The chicken itself was good but the fregola it came with was what made the dish. Definitely coming back! 

Now, on to the lounging experience. We waiting until midnight to move to the lounging area but it still wasn't that packed and people weren't really dancing. The crowd was made up of people in their 30s and others in low 20s and they really didn't seem to gel. Also, people getting bottle service just seemed to sit at their tables the whole time instead of eventually joining the crowd and dancing. The music was okay, some hip hop along with music that you really couldn't dance to. Stuck around until 12:45 and the situation still didn't improve so we called it quits and found a better club."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a few days visiting my sister, and we chose Brassaii to celebrate her birthday and my last night in town. Sure the restaurant seemed to try a little hard and be a little pretentious but the menu looked great, and our waiter was super friendly.

All was fine, despite the soggy salad, until the main courses arrived. My sister's boyfriend's steak was charred, charred, literally. He asked to have it sent back which our nice waiter did only to have the steak returned minutes later by the GM. Said GM proceeded to berate our friend that his steak was perfectly done and that the kitchen didn't have to return it. What the heck!?! Who does that? 

Every one of us at the table is or has been involved in the food business over the years, and we've never seen or experienced anything like that. To top it off, when my sister bit into her pork dish it was raw.

Finally, the GM left us alone and a few minutes later the chef came out. He was appalled, and our waiter was also clearly embarrassed. They sent out a huge plate of cookies and comped the two meals, but what an awful, awful way to end the trip. 

I really wished we'd picked somewhere else to go."}
{"text":"I wouldnt recommend going here for dinner. The brunch is great but dinner is horrible. The food was soo bland and there have 0 vegetarian dishes. My friend who is vegetarian said the food tastes like cardboard. Eeks! The staff was okay, not overly friendly but meh."}
{"text":"We went there to celebrate friend's birthday. Disappointed with everything starting with the entrance and interaction with security... We booked bottle service, yet when we arrived there was no booth available for us, so they just put us at the back in their restaurant area. The back room was not open ( I guess because it was Friday and they did not expect many guests). The DJ played songs that you can listen on the radio in your car NOT in a club. Music sucked. It was impossible to dance also because that main room became too crowded. Overall just disappointed. Not worth the $$$"}
{"text":"Visited with a friend in need a much cheering up and I must say they didn't disappoint. The service from initial greeting to our exit was fantastic and definitely earns the staff a good sized tip!
 
Enough with the service, the menu is short and sweet and features a fairly simple and classy set of offerings. Most of the food is local and they have both vegetarian and omnivore directed meals. The friend and I picked up a salad each, one beet and one arugula, both of which were enjoyed immensely. The balance of the different textures and flavours was well thought out and showed their skill at crafting locally inspired menus.

Although summer is coming to an end, their patio is one of the best I've been on, its recessed and allows for a sound and smell protected environment to enjoy a brunch time hangout! =)

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Our waitress made the experience fantastic (thanks Karen!). Somehow she managed to maintain enthusiastic energy while getting busier and busier!  The food was mediocre (at best) and pretty expensive.  I ordered the portobello pizza and I'm glad Karen gave me the heads up on what exactly it was. I would have expected an actual pizza, it was just like a pizza but served on a portobello cap. It was quite tasty though, just not worth the $15-16 I paid for it.  I ordered fries as a side and they were sadly a bit hard and cold. Others at my table did enjoy their meals so that was a plus (there were about 12 of us).  We didn't feel rushed at all which was so appreciated. The ambiance was nice and the crowd was mature. As the night turned to the lounge portion, the music was good (top 40).  It got very packed quickly. The outdoor patio and seating were great and we were grateful it was a nice night to enjoy it. The dance floor is small and if it wasn't for the outdoor space we likely would have gone elsewhere for some elbow space! Definitely recommend Brassaii if you are looking for a nice evening out downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Went for a 8:30 dinner on a weekday and sat indoors.  The restaurant felt spacious and fairly fancy--relatively high ceilings and an exposed kitchen.  

The waitstaff was friendly.  Our waiter highly recommended the ostrich so I changed my order from the lamb to the ostrich.  The ostrich, served medium-rare, was perfectly cooked and amazing.  

We also ordered the halibut and the crab cake appetizer.  The halibut was pretty good but the crab cake appetizer was terrible.  Both my friend and I could barely taste the crab.  In my opinion, the crab cake knocked this place from a true 4 star to a 3.5 star."}
{"text":"Party gone wrong. Ouch. 
We had our company even here and i can't think of how many things went wrong. So many levels of miscommunication from the number of people, to the table placement to the order itself. We had picked out both food and wine in advance and a waiter, who clearly didn't get any of the instructions decides that he's going to ask everyone for their wine order, so we end up with a whole mix of wine that we shouldn't have had. 
The selection of dishes they gave us was also pretty odd. If you didn't order the steak on the prix fix we ordered you ended up having less than everyone those who did, by a long way. I was one of those unfortunates, and ended up watching people eat their meat for another 20 minutes after I had finished my tiny piece of fish. I will qualify my criticism by saying that the food was good. 
Clearly their management is a mess and needs to be fixed before companies should consider hosting events there. Or at least if you're going to host an event, be aware that they probably won't get it right the first time."}
{"text":"Wow! The brunch!!!!!!! 
This place is the best brunch spot I've ever been to. The food was sooooooo delicious and the portions here are HUGE!!! Decor is beautiful and the waiter was awesome!!! Definitely recommend this place- we will be back."}
{"text":"J'y suis passé deux fois : une fois en couple pour un anniversaire, une autre fois pour une réunion amicale. Excellente présentation, plats bien préparés aux saveurs agréables et un très bon service."}
{"text":"Avoid on Valentine's Day, or any other night likely to be crowded!

This was the worst Valentine's dinner ever. I have been to Brassaii previously and liked it, but they don't scale up very well. The tables were crammed together in long rows, it looked like an assembly line of couples dining, and there was not enough room to even squeeze between the tables - you had to walk around the end of the row to get to the other side, meaning that the people dining on either side were uncomfortably close. Not at all a romantic atmosphere. They brought my husband the wrong dish, and when I asked about it, the server insisted it was the right one, even though it clearly wasn't. We didn't want to wait and have my food get cold so he ate it (it was good, don't get me wrong, just not what he ordered)."}
{"text":"Brassaii can be fun on Wednesdays with their drink and appetizer special. The restaurant turns more into a club and there is room for dancing and there are some great cocktails on the menu."}
{"text":"My friends and I intended to go to Citizen, however we were out of luck because we arrived downtown pretty late and it was an hour wait, so we ended up at Brassai. It was the first time for all of us ladies and we ended up having a blast. Decor is beautiful,  they played a good selection of music although there were times where Dj Analyze (and I assume its spelled with a \"z\" because its \"cooler\") needed to analyze the situation a little better with the music at times. But hey you can't always please everyone. 

You still had your douchy guys trying to hit on you from time to time but I've been in places where its much worse. At Brassai the girls and I weren't bothered too much and we still had a good time. 

Another thing I liked was the crowd. It was a mature and classy crowd for the most part. The last thing I want (and this is the problem sometimes with clubs in Toronto) is little tiney boppers with their drunk selves ruining everyone's vibe. 
  
The one thing I have to critique about this place (and I already know the answer) was the drinks were priceyyyyyyy. So definitely have a couple or a few drinks before you go. 

I would definitely go back for sure."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd.

This is our favorite favorite favorite weekend brunch spot in the entire city.  The food is beyond delicious, really interesting takes on brunch classics that fill your tummy with breakfast goodness, and the brunch cocktail list offers tasty treats like mimosas.  Terrific outdoor seating for warmer months, and really awesome modern-yet-comfortable interior dining room.

Blowing my mind that there's only one review on here for Brassaii.  GO.  GO NOW. GO OFTEN."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place for ages and finally got the chance. Finally got the chance for a friends birthday. There were 5 of us. Service was extremely poor and slow. We had to wait to get the servers attention each and every time. When we got all our food we had no cutlery. Dessert took 40 mins to come out. Won't return."}
{"text":"If there is an option for 0 stars, I'd pick that 10x over.  The place is nicely decorated, the staff are well dressed, too bad the rest is just nothing but crap.

HOSTESS:
- she was extremely snobby, we were 10 min prior to our reservation of 15 and she acted as if the table isn't ready.  It was 7:05pm and there was about only 3 couples so far in the place.  ps: it was an asian girl named Patricia

SERVER:
- he was attentive at first, but as the night went on and we ordered more and more drinks.  The attitude came out.  Just because we placed about 8 different orders at 8 different times, he felt it was imposing on him and making him take extra trips.  We brought our own cake, not only did it cost $5/person for catering but it took him 45 minutes (no lie) to plate it for us.

MANAGER:
- This has got to be the most gender-confused-evil-little-black-leprechaun in the world.  We had 2 table reservations for 7pm and another at 7:30pm.  At 7pm, he came up to our table, sat down and said \"ok, what is the problem?\"  we were all confused since no one told our waiter about any problem.  It turned out, he wanted to move our 7:30pm reservation because of another group, which later came to sit down at the table reserved for us.  Instead of telling us the real reason, he made up of bullsh!t reasons ranging from \"you'll only have 2hrs for dinner services when that group comes at 7:30pm\" to \"the place will be packed and we might have to move you all during your dinner\".  We stayed until 12am eating, the restaurant was NEVER at full capacity, not even at 75% seating capacity.

FOOD:
- Compared to Jack Astor, it is step-up.  Compared to even The Keg, it is far off.  But the price is double that of the The Keg, so be mindful.

ATMOSPHERE:
- no complain there, music wasn't too loud and the lighting was perfect.

Would I go back, not if this was the last restaurant on Earth.

ps: and they charges 18% PRE-tax for gratuity which is the same as 15% including-tax.  Trust me, with the service we got (and indicated by most Google user), it is NOT 18% worthy."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a group of almost 10. It's a lovely space and a nice place to get together for a special occasion.  I ordered the lobster club sandwich with coleslaw and fries.  Sadly, I didn't think my lobster sandwich had much flavour, I primarily tasted the bacon in the sandwich.  The fries were crispy, salted & herbed.  They also serve side orders of fried green tomatoes which I enjoyed.  One friend ordered the basic 2 eggs any style and said her food was delish.  I would probably come back for a group/special occasion brunch but would order more of a classic brunch item or try their chicken and waffles, but this wouldn't be my go-to brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and we ordered Cobb salad and chicken waffle. Food was at par with the price they charge and service was quick. It's a comfortable neat and clean brunch place for a Sunday morning. Our server although not very much attentive, he did his job of completing our order in a timely manner. All in all, it's an ok place, go with average expectation."}
{"text":"Not bad. Came here for Father's Day brunch. We have been here a few years ago and generally got the same impression. The food is good not fantastic. The pancakes with ricotta and Lemon curd were the highlight. The lamb wrap was too heavy and just ok. The yogurt was nice. The service was good."}
{"text":"I completely agree with some of the reviews on here. I came here with a party of around 10 people and we were given a set 3-course menu. Service was slow and food was mediocre - the entree was extremely generic and the server recommended their creme brulee, but it was a miss amongst the party and was a disappointment. For ~$65/person, I expected the food to be way better. The best part was dessert as I ordered sorbet - but that's something I don't expect any restaurant to screw up on.

As it got later into the night, half of the restaurant becomes a lounge/club-type atmosphere. As the night went on, I realized the music really sucked. The choices in music  made it very difficult to dance along to and get the crowd going. On a Saturday night, it got more packed as it got late, but still NOBODY danced. In fact, it was awkward to because no one seemed to be interested in dancing and the space is cramped because of tables everywhere.

I would not return. This place is trying to do too much yet failing in the basics. If they want to establish a name as a restaurant, it needs better food. If it wants to be a cool club/party place for the older crowd, have better music."}
{"text":"The food was ok, nothing amazing though. I did however go once for the winterlicious and loved what I got."}
{"text":"Very classy! Love the 25+ crowd on Wednesdays. 

Music was alright but def a place to visit."}
{"text":"Fine selection of wines and even better cocktail menu this place means business. Crisp food thats not complicated and well executed makes me come back for more quality food and bevvies.

Great for work meetings, birthdays, romantic dinners, client meetings and nights out. Basically Brassaii is prepared to help you have a great experience for every life moment."}
{"text":"My friend Jocelyn asked me pick a restaurant to have her birthday dinner.  That's my primary function as a friend, I'm very good at this.  Instincts told me to not plan this party, so picking the venue was all the responsibility that I've adopted to take on, I also offered to make the reservations. Two tables, 10 per table.  First note of Brassaii, poor telephone manners.

I showed up on Saturday evening, walking down the dark alleyway to the entrance which reminded me of a Russian Mafia gentleman club.  I came through the doors and saw Jocelyn and  few of her friends in what appeared to be some sort of confusion.  Turns out that somebody brought their own cake but was unaware of the per slice charge restaurants had on cakes.  I was surprised at this unnecessary confusion, so decided to pay no attention to it.  If you bring food from outside, then there's a fee, just like if you bring your own wine you're expected to pay corkage. 
I checked my jacket with whom I thought was the Maitre'D, but really just turned out to be the coat check girl.  She was unable to take my bowler hat because there was inadequate space for my headdress.  It was completely stupid so I had to give my hat to someone with a purse .

The restaurant, like other restaurants on King built their décor around the industrial ambiance of the business which preceded the present gentrification era.  I took a risk by picking this place knowing that after 10 Brassaii turned into a nightclub.  I was shown to my table, I was among the first to arrive.  
The bar was illuminated by neon lights which eliminated any feel of opulence, it was dimly lit throughout, so the mold & cob webs on the brick walls was barely noticeable.  Our waiter seemed to be a friendly man in his early 30's, but wasn't very helpful when I ordered the Tempranillo, we had to find it on the menu together, and when I say 'we' I mean 'I'.  I asked that the wine be ordered but put on hold until more people showed up.  Guests began arriving one-by-one until my table was filled...and then it stopped.  The second table was empty and it remained empty for 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20, 30...
The Maitre'D  became anxious and started threatening us that the table be given to other if no one showed up in the next five minutes.  I had to reassure everyone that we indeed had a reservation, and that's what reservations are for...to reserve things.  But I was getting anxious and very annoyed.  Tardiness in restaurants is very poor etiquette; this is delaying everyone who decided to come on time.  After 40 minutes I just said screw it and called for my wine, which actually took another 15 minutes. 
It was my first time trying tempranillo, it was disgusting!  

After a full hour, the remaining guests finally showed up.  But what's most egregious of all was that they offered little to almost no apology.  \"Oh sorry we're late..something something happened and therefore...the end\" 
Are you having a piss?  One HOUR late, and they didn't give two shit.  
We began ordering, I got the salad, it came before everyone appetizers which was awkward.  There was a seafood platter, some steak.  The food was mediocre at best, served on ceramic plates probably purchased at Benix.   

Twenty minutes into dinner I noticed the latecomers were becoming strangely impatient (irony) about something.  It seems that the service staff have been ignoring them, and only refilling their waters, which I secretly found to be hilarious.  Our waiter got into an argument with one of the guests, and supposedly she complained about waiting for service, then the waiter quipped he was waiting for their arrival for much longer, something I would have said!  Oh, the poor attitude, but I couldn't get mad!  That comment really pissed them off, and so they selfishly called for the manager without thinking twice about the uncomfortable situation they would render everyone else to, including the birthday girl!
Let's just say these fellows aren't what you call 'great debaters', and soon found themselves in an argument with the manager.  This dinner turned into an embarrassing scene, which finally ended up as latecomers VS. restaurant staff, and some guy who claimed to be the owner.  I remained completely nonchalant and watched this chaos unfold on the dining floor.  I would have enjoyed it if only my wine were better tasting.  

So, after another twenty minutes of fighting they decided they were just going to up and LEAVE!  Complete disregard on how it would affect the rest of the \"party\".   Naturally our table was forced to quickly finish our food and leave with them.  I never chugged wine so fast in my life.  DID I MENTION I DIDN'T LIKE THE WINE?!
The evening was a horrible display of atrocious etiquette, and poor decisions.  Everyone was angry with the restaurant except for me.  I was angry at the latecomer who initiated, escalated, and poorly managed a situation which f**ked everyone else's evening.  
Pedestrian upbringing.

ONE HOUR LATE"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot, didn't get the memo about the white party that was going on, but def a nice sized crowd for a Thursday night. Drinks were very weak though, 200 bucks later I was barely tipsy, I'm a grown man put a little bit more alcohol in my cup mannnnn"}
{"text":"Steak and risotto were tasty. Place tried so too hard to \"be fancy\" while the food isn't quite up to par."}
{"text":"As a night club, Brassaii would normally get 4 stars from me, but we went Friday night, paid $10 to get in, only to find out that they don't open the dance floor on Fridays, and there was a private function going on which was completely occupying 2/3 of the bar.
Um, hello dumb dumbs. Am I the ONLY one that thinks that MAYBE, just maybe, they should have told us that BEFORE we paid to get in?
Way to piss off one of your regulars.
Lesson learned: ask the staff at the door what's going on inside that night before going in."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Behind Crush Wine Bar (which I haven't tried since the new gastro-pub concept) is a courtyard in front of Brassaii. It is a long, narrow restaurant with an open kitchen prep area on the right side. A private dining room in the back seats up to 60 people and can be used for presentations or business meetings. The menu covers all areas. Salad as a starter was one of the best I've had and huge! Blue cheese, pears, walnuts, delicious dressing- everyone finished it off. I also had the pasta with boccocini cheese- always one of my faves. The pasta appeared and tasted as if it was home made. It's been awhile since I had pasta noodles that were that good. Appetizer options also come with high praise. Service with knowledgeable and efficient."}
{"text":"We went out last night to the clubbing part of Brassaii. The bouncers were very nice to us so I don't know where the mean comments are coming from. We were 10 of us and it was 8 guys and two girls. The place itself is beautiful and has pretty OK top 40 DJ. She did actually take our requests and play some hip hop. Overall very nice place, just very crowded to the point that dancing sometimes became difficult."}
{"text":"Only ever come here for the nightlife and only ever been on a Wednesday or a Sunday which is ran by the same promotions group.

Wednesday is definitely the better night, bit more chilled out and good vibes and music. I don't think there is anywhere these days that does not have an obnoxious bottle crowd so expect to see plenty of that at brassai.

The staff are a mixed bunch, some are friendly and some are just plain rude but surprisingly the door staff are always cool.

Sundays is the Le Brunch series of events, it used to be really good but lately has lost a lot of its appeal and charm. Expect bad service and really really busy venue full of baseball wearing, gold chain douche types."}
{"text":"Initially when my friend chose this place for her birthday I wrote it off as an uppity Bay Street,  ethnically homogeneous young professionals watering hole.  And I couldn't have been more right.  The service was ok except we received our meals almost an hour after sitting drinking and 5 trays of salty bread. Now they failed to mention that there would be a $7/plate (~$60 total extra on the bill)  charge for our personal cake and the server became a complete jerk when we refused to pay the unauthorized fee.  

They would've received a higher rate if the food was good.  I'm very willing to spend a little extra but they were heavy handed with the cheese in the meatballs, the angnoloni or whatever was unremarkable and the chicken plate was just plain terrible. The only salvageable plate was the octopus. 

If I did return it would be in 10 years (crowd was 35-50) and would make sure I ate ahead of time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here recently on a weeknight.

The good:
- Waiter was friendly and helpful
- Food was great - the scallops are delicious

The bad:
- Extremely snobby at the front door. I arrived alone as my friend was already waiting inside, seated. Nobody was at the front; I waited, and soon two couples showed up behind me. When someone finally appeared, both couples were seated before me and I was completely ignored. 

Not sure why. But that turned me off the entire place despite the wonderful scallops. 

Sorry Brassaii, you really need to work on your hostess manners at the front door."}
{"text":"There is clearly a lack of management and presentation about this bar.
- We were a group of 20 people sitting at the patio. The temperature being a little bit low we asked the staff to turn on the heat but it barely worked....
- The beer menu is not available on paper so everytime the waitress had to tell us what beer they had. Would be simple enough to print a beer menu or to put them along with the wine list.
- Food menu is not detailed enough, some of my friends who do not eat pork ordered some dishes thinking the details of the ingredients were precise enough but they ended up eating pork without knowing. The menu should mention if the dishes have pork or even cream for lactose intolerant customers.
-One of my friends asked to switch the meat that was coming with a salad with something else. She was told she had to order ta second dish with the meat she wanted. I mean it's a common way in many bars to swith an ingredient, we could have paid a little bit more for that but seriously order a second dish????
-Finally I felt sorry for the waitresses whose clothes are way too innapropriate to serve customers. Poor girls could barely walked in their high heels and their skirts that they had to readjust every 5 minutes. (marketing strategy to attract more customers?) Come one people you can do better than that."}
{"text":"This review is based on a 3 course dinner for larger parties.

My friend had a reservation for about 16 people at 9:30 and I was one of the last to arrive at 9:45. Service was good and they took our drink orders pretty quick. Around 10:00, the servers went around the table and took our orders and served us some bread while we waited. Everything on the menu sounded pretty good so I decided to go with the mushroom soup, pasta and creme Brulee. My girlfriend opted for the salmon and we would split our entrees.

Everything started to go downhill when the soup arrived. When read the menu and saw the mushroom apple soup, I assumed it was going to be a cream based soup but what the server placed in front of me was a bowl of water with some boiled mushrooms and apples. I've never had a more bland soup in my life. It actually just tasted like wet mushrooms and nothing else. I decided to just tough it out and not complain since I was there for a friend's birthday.

Next issue was the main course. The \"soup\" came out around 10:30 and I expected the main to come out maybe 11 the latest. I was off about 40 minutes or so. Our food took way way way too long, especially with a set menu. As soon as the food came, we devoured it all since we were starving. The salmon was pretty good and so was the striploin (took a bite from my friend) but the pasta was very disappointing. Portion-wise, it was tiny. Like 5 bites of pasta tiny. Yes, it was a vegetarian option but I'm sure even vegetarians have an appetite bigger than a 4 year old. It was also extremely greasy, like you don't need lip balm for a week kind of greasy.

The dessert was alright. It's a creme Brulee. You can't really screw it up unless you burn the sugar, which was kinda burnt on my girlfriends.

After dessert came coffee and tea. We had to go up to the servers to tell them our order since they were busy moving tables and chairs since the restaurant was going into club-mode. Coffee was bad but I didn't expect much.

My final gripe with the place is the bill. I knew the price beforehand so I had pretty high expectations but those disappeared as soon as I had the soup. Everything came up to over $90 with 18% grats included with big groups. I had a nice glass of whiskey but $90 for my meal is ridiculous. I don't suggest anyone come here if they don't like to wait or want decent food at a good price. I can't speak on the club since I left as soon as I paid but hey, you get free cover if you have dinner beforehand, so that's a plus.

P. S. Forgot to take pictures because I was so hungry and I know the restaurant turns into a club but the music was wayyyyyyy to loud to begin with."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Brassaii.
I was all about it years ago, but after my last couple of visits, I found I needed a pitcher of water - everything was a salt lick.

Maybe they've toned it down a bit....maybe not.
There are so many restaurants in the King West area that I'm not really that curious to go back and find out.

Brassaii does have a pretty kick ass patio. It's huge. 

Check it out, but you won't lose any sleep if you don't make it there."}
{"text":"I have been a victim of racism at this establishment. It was on a Wednesday night when the restaurant turns into a club. I was assaulted and chocked to the point where they caused me to have a lump grow on my throat. I did not adhere to their inherent racist dress code. Forgetting that they had a dress code, I got hot on the dance floor and took off my sweater. I had a shirt under of course. Not more than 30 seconds, I see about 4 big body guards coming after me. I pleaded to put on the sweater but before I could put it on they picked me up, threw me on the ground, chocked me, took me out of the club, threw me on the ground again, and punched me until I could not move. I was laying on King street for a good 10 minutes before I could move again. This is the worst experience I've ever had anywhere. I hope anyone who reads this reconsiders their visit here."}
{"text":"The ambiance was very nice. Spacious and elegantly styled basement type feel. It turns into a club at 10pm on Wed and Sat.

Our server was really nice. He toured us around the restaurant to show the club parts of the restaurant.

But I'm all about the food, so here goes:

EGGS BENEDICT - Two poached eggs + beef tenderloin + red wine hollandaise sauce + english muffin

The eggs benedict were disappointing. Not enough hollandaise sauce. Very little beef - not enough to cover entire muffin and you can't even see it as there's way more veggies.


CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - Herbed waffle + fried chicken + maple syrup + chicken gravy. 

I liked the chicken and waffles more. Though it was a little over fried, it was still tender and juicy. 


The best part is you get a free glass of prosecco when you Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my girlfriends and was quite impressed with the food. For starters, we ordered the freshly baked hit cinnamon rolls and a deliciously brewed coffee. Then I ordered the Omelette with wild mushrooms, cheese and truffle oil, which paired very well with the brioche and salad. My friends ordered the Waffle Benedict with Pulled Shortribs and Waffles and Fried Chicken. Their Mimosas were excellent!  Our service really good and the staff were really friendly. The atmosphere is very and the washroom was clean. 
Will I come back again, for sure!!!"}
{"text":"This building is totally gorgeous.  It is massive, bright, interesting and well designed.  I am not a club rat so the \"lounge/club\" aspect of the establishment does not appeal to me.  Brassaii describes itself as a \"sophisticated nouveau riche cosmopolitan and culture destination.\"  That is grand.  I actually laughed out loud when I first read that. I thought well ya; I suppose that is all encompassing of the nature of my style.  Ha-ha.  When I arrived I was impressed with the building and the patio. The food did not blow me away and the price was reflective of the district.  In my mind's eye all I saw were a lot of fake boobs and real a**holes.  So, if you enjoy the following you may enjoy Brassaii: the fine art of grinding on the dance floor, ordering bottle service, standing on tables/couches, cat fights, girls falling over in their heels, and a vast frivolous consumption of alcohol. Finally, the refined atmosphere that has always eluded you."}
{"text":"Went to Brassaii last night with a group of friends for a welcome-home party for one of the girls. We walked in past their outdoor areas that looked fantastic. I loved that they had an outdoor fireplace for drinks. However, we were there for dinner. It was a bit early to eat on a Saturday (our reservations were for 7pm) and the place was a bit quiet. From start to finish, the service was extremely attentive and friendly without being pushy. 

The building itself is beautiful and it is divided into a spot for drinks at the front and the restaurant in the back. The ceilings are high and the walls are painted brick, giving it a really airy and clean feeling. However, I felt that the lack of soft furnishings (other than some banquette seating) made for an overly noisy atmosphere. 

The food was good -- I had the gnocchi which had lamb chunks and mint in a tomato sauce -- but it didn't blow me away. The dessert I had, however, was fantastic (the parfait) and they had some nice touches, such as a cocktail cart that a bartender brought around to each table. 

All in all, it's a good spot to go with a group of friends -- in fact, all of the tables there seemed to be large group reservations -- with a menu that will please everyone."}
{"text":"This review is only for Sunday brunch. It was okay. The space itself is massive and seemed very empty even with several tables full. Menu looked good but a but limited."}
{"text":"I had bottle service here for my birthday and it was great! My service (Sherry) was very pleasant and accommodating, and even though I had more guests than expected, they let them all in for free. We goofed around and danced on the coaches and the staff were cool with that."}
{"text":"I went to Brassaii twice in one week  for two different meals and had two opposing experiences. Instead of averageing them out I am going to write two reviews. 

This one is for BRUNCH which should get 4 stars.

We met up with some friends for brunch on a Sunday and it was great to have elbow room as it wasn't too crowded. I was disappointed that they don't offer any muffins or bread for the table but I must say that the food was great. I had eggs benny with peameal bacon and my DH had the same with smoked salmon. All four of us also shared a basket of muffins and those were delish. We did not feel hurried and lingered over coffee and good conversation.

This one is for DINNER which should get 2.5 stars.

My DH brought me back to Brassaii this past weekend for a pre-birthday celebration. The place looked great and was pretty packed at 9pm. Although we had asked for a corner (quieter) table we were seated right in middle, next two very loud women. Note that there is barely any elbow room between tables here. To make things worse they seated a table of about 10 - 12 college grads right behind us. Not very fun if you are trying to enjoy a conversation.
Out waitress was inattentive and ignored us for most of the evening. We poured our own wine and didn't get any bread at all. 
All this would've been bearable if the food had been good. I ordered the foie gras app and it was a tiny sliver of it on a mushy piece of brioche - not very appectizing especially when you are charging entre prices for it. My husband ordered the oysters and there wasn't anything special about it. We've definitely had better elsewhere in TO. For my main I ordered the rissotto which wasn't my favorite - it had a strange paintain aftertaste to it. My husband ordered the steak and although it was cooked well, the portion was pretty sad. 
We saw the manager (owner?) walking around but she ignored us as well otherwise we would have been happy to share our experience with her. 

For the price of the meal, we felt ignored, dissatisfied and a little annoyed with all the noise behind us. Toronto has a lot of other great restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"I realize if you walk into anywhere with attitude it will just come back to you , so let loose and have fun and enjoy what the city has to offer , I LOVE THIS PLACE Wednesday nights its fantastic it really is everyone is friendly like I said if you give attitude it just comes back so have fun folks and enjoy , OH YES AND THE FOOD ALWAYS GOOD AND SHAWN THE BIG DOOR MAN LOVE HIM"}
{"text":"Was there on a Wednesday night with friends. Frankly, this place is over rated. The food is just average and insanely pricey. Please skip this place and go somewhere better."}
{"text":"I have been here many times...but this time I came for the food. I wish I could post two different ratings. 
For the lounge experience I would give a five, especially on a Wednesday night. 

For the dining experience it's a sad three. Food was good but the service was horrible. It took forever just to give in our drink order and the server kept getting out drinks wrong. At one point he came back to me and said he forgot what I ordered !! While waiting for our meals the server was difficult to get a hold
Of....we needed refills!!!  Just before the entrees came the server spoke to me and had the worst and most disgusting smell of cigarettes reeling from him like an ashtray dirty chimney. I wanted to throw up...which explains why he was missing...he had to light a butt! 
Food finally came. I had the pork steak which was delicious. My friend had the chicken which she loved. The brussel sprouts with bacon was yum!!! Another friend ordered the risotto which she found dry. I did enjoy my meal and we also got complimentary bread which was fresh and soft. Paying also was a mission. I couldn't wait to pay and start lounging. But I'd have to say this Saturday night crowd was ghetto and it was overpacked!!!! They need to raise cover or limit who walks in!!! 
One last comment, coat check...they need a better system....took way too long and the girl couldn't find my sweater for the longest time !"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with both the food and the service at Brassaii.  

My friend had her bachelorette dinner and party here and it was a great time!

I wasn't expecting much from the food to be completely honest.  It's a resto-bar turned into club after 11pm.  The menu selection was quite good and the portions matched the prices.  Definitely on par.  Don't you hate paying a lot of money and getting no food?  Although there were a few slight misses in terms of sauces and/or sides, the main proteins were all very well cooked.  My scallops were perfect.  

If you're looking to accommodate a large group for dinner and want to do some dancing afterwards, Brassaii is the place to be.  You can get bottle service too.  The music was a good mix of some old school hip hop, EDM, and stuff in-between."}
{"text":"Fancy Schmancy! At least inside the restaurant.

Not so fancy schmancy for my party of 3 enjoying drinks on their lively patio. The patio atmosphere was lovely, especially on this gorgeous summer day, but I did find the chairs to be a bit uncomfortable. Then again most chairs are uncomfortable for me these days since I'm pregnant.

I ordered a shirley temple, which tasted an awfully lot like lemonade. This was the 2nd shirley temple in Toronto that tasted like lemonade so thinking maybe they make it differently than I'm used to back in Chicago. Regardless it was refreshing and hit the spot so I wasn't too jealous of their normal cocktail menu (everything sounded great).

When I went inside to use the restroom, which was one of the few restrooms I've found in Toronto that's not in the basement, I noticed a few plates of food. Everything looks delish. I'd definitely be up for checking this out for a real meal the next time I'm in Toronto. Hopefully their service is better when you actually eat here as well because we found it to be a tad on the slow side."}
{"text":"Great interior, very good food, if a bit heavy. Good for entertaining folks."}
{"text":"I used to like this club (restaurant turns into a club), but they really got to me last time I went out for my friend's bday. We went on a Wednesday night, recently (unfortunately, the previous wednesday night DJ is no longer at this club). It was cold, but there was no coat check. I have honestly never heard such awful music in my life on that night with that particular DJ. It was so bad, that my friend suggested we leave a complaint. The DJ mixed SUM 41 (WHAT!!!) with a house track, and then decided to play Queen, and then go back to dance. Like what are you doing... No one was dancing. Long story short, I asked 3 different people to speak to management because there were 3 managers, but no one would let me. The hostess said: \"Like, I'm sorry you feel that way\" (like a broken record). And then said, \"Well, I like it.\" Wonderful service. One of the bouncers yelled at me asking me what I wanted him to do. For the record, I wasn't trying to get comps, I just wanted them to be aware that they present themselves as an upscale club, and shouldn't hire delinquent DJs."}
{"text":"My favourite night club in Toronto 

I had such an amazing experience here. Had a booth and bottles for my birthday and Brasaii surpassed my expectations. 

Nelson took care of me and my party and ensured everything was perfect 

My whole party got in quick and easy with line bypass. The music and Dj was great and the service was perfect. Two rooms with two different sounds, multiple bars and a classy environment 

I will 100% book again. Flawless evening."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here before, food is mediocre and overpriced, at best. 

My review is about going there for when its a full on supper club - ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!! Brassaii is in the trendy part of king west, trying very hard to be brant house or something more upscale but it was incredibly lame... lets start with the douchebag bouncer/clipboard guy, you go down some sketchy alley where all the people from firkin are smoking so i had no clue where the line started.. when i finally get in what i think is a line and it's my turn (I was there by myself meeting friends inside), I'm about to go in behind a group of guys and hte bouncer ropes it off on me pushing me aside... first of all, your lame club is NOT at capacity, I am one woman by myself, even if I was a grotesque toad, you could let me in because lets face it, I would really up the visuals in this pathetic excuse for a club. I'm like excuse me? are you letting me in or what? and he, in a very rude tone, tells me he has to let the party he's dealing with in first... because just letting me in right after would make your club go over capacity or something? meanwhile, my friend txted me the name of a friend who had reserved the table. Now when I name drop, this guy's tone changes in an instant, turns out they have the biggest table in the middle and I can't miss it when I head in, he lets me in immediately and becomes polite all of a sudden. First of all, easy with the power trip. If the highlight of his miserable life is standing in the rain for 4 hours with a clipboard on a saturday night in an alley, doesn't mean he has to take it out on patrons. Even if all you do is stand with a friggin clipboard all night and deny people entrance, there's a level of candor and hospitality you should maintain as the first point of contact people have at a club. This was some nasty white guy with spiked hair (like that narrows it down), absolutely pathetic and rubbed me the wrong way. I hope his loser ass gets fired or he gets some training on how to be a decent human being.

Well I finally get in and it's douche central, music is top 40s and dumb sh!t like \"wiggle wiggle\" lol I feel like I've stepped into some high school day jam... the crowd was questionable and not my scene, so not worth the $10 cover. If you're looking for an upscale experience on king west - THIS IS NOT IT! Save your money and go somewhere nice like brant house (also douchey but at least lives up to being more upscale than this place) or honsetly, anywhere else on king west lol I won't be going back there and I hope they shut down or fire management/lame bouncers and aggressive bus boys, I get that you have to pick up glasses in a rush but you don't have to shove people out of your way, the glasses won't melt if you take an extra five seconds to walk around people"}
{"text":"Horrible place!!! Crappy service!!! My friends and I bought tickets in advance for the Halloween event. We arrived at 11pm and waited an hour to get in. Then we realized they were not letting ticket holders in and bailed. Horrible experience!!!. Why sell tickets and then not let anyone in? Did they oversell? A big waste of money and time!!!!! When we spoke to a security guard, they gave no explanations."}
{"text":"So got to try out the winterlicious menu this weekend here and it was good.

We wanted to try items on the regular menu as well but due to our large group, we were only allowed to do the winterlicious menu which sucked!

So my items were, appetizer: house made bread salad, main: braised beef short rib and dessert: apple blueberry crisp.  I enjoyed my appetizer with the root vegetables, I didn't get much bread in mine.  I should have ordered the seared tuna and pork belly app, tasted hubby's and it was really good.  My main was good as well, loved the potato croquettes.  Last, dessert was ok for me, tasted more like oatmeal.  My overall views of the food was that everything tasted good and maybe even great, but nothing amazing for me.

Atmosphere is busy, a lot of people were at the restaurant and it was a full house.  Good music that night and once the kitchen closes, the night life takes over with music, dancing and drinks.

Overall, a good nice place to go to with good food!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and energy to this place, started with drinks at the Firkin next door then moved to Brassai once it was open. Fun times and one of my favourite during the week spots. Its definitely upscale, dress well"}
{"text":"We went there some time ago and the food we had was good including the service. 
I forgot what we had ordered though. But no bad experience.
The only thing I remember is that it wasn't cheap."}
{"text":"I can't believe Brassaii has become the douchiest place possible.  
slight exaggeration, but not by much.

You guys, let me school you on Brassaii- back in the day it used to be honestly a grade A restaurant.  Good value, good scene. just a great place for all meals- honestly.  Then for some reason they started to become more a club than a restaurant.  They became much more known for their high end pretentious fake-it-til-you-make-it crowd and then now everything THINKs its just a club.  and heck... that's pretty much what it will end up being, I guess.  But for THAT, I will have to demote it.

I can't even BELIEVE I gave it 5 stars before.. and now it stands at a pathetic 2.
I came here reluctantly for a birthday party.  I knew what the vibe was going to be like because I HAVE seen what it has turned into over the years.  Douche-city (aka- my money replaces my personality).  
Said birthday boy got bottle service.  Gah..I don't know why ANYONE gets bottle service in Toronto.  This isn't Vegas or LA, people.  You still ARE going to get into the club.  Unless you are a large group of dudes there is no real benefit of getting bottle service in Toronto EVER.
There was like..no waitress attendant in sight. Ever.  So bottle service at Brassaii meant that they drop off some expensive bottles at your table and then you get to sit down for a bit and pretend it's your exclusive space when really anyone else sits there.

And my BIGGEST concern with this place is that NOBODY ACTUALLY DANCES.  They just kind of stand around in their overly-done outfits, unnecessarily uncomfortable shoes and try to look pretty when, in fact they are getting so wasted that they end up leaving the bar trashed out, makeup running down their face, false eyelashes lifting off their eyes; shirts and dresses falling off; super pushup bras starting to befcome more visible than their shirt and bare foot because they finally realize their shoe choice for the night was terrible.

ok, so maybe this rant goes for ANY place in the club district.  But what really gets me is that Brassaii honest to god used to be a GOOD restaurant in its own right and on its own.  And they ruined that.  So much fail.

Bahumbug."}
{"text":"I've come here for brunch as well as when it was a nightclub. Neither experience was particularly memorable. 

For brunch my companion ordered an eggs Benedict and salad and I had very sweet decadent pancakes. We shared a teapot. It came to $45 which, for that area, is about average. The waitress's dress had a slit literally all the way up to her hip, which was a bit distracting, but I assume that is the point. The man taking our order took a long time, but once the order was through, the food came quite quickly, which was nice as we were short on time. The tea was some fancy blend but tasted like normal black tea - and the coffee was average, as well. 

The decor though, was beautiful. It has nice couches at the front, low tables, and then in the back there were families and couples all nicely dressed, having their brunch. No one looked at me funny for wearing short denim shorts, Nikes and a backpack, either, which was nice, since I did not fit in, but didn't feel unwelcome. 

Now on to the club experience. I ended up there with some fancy friends who are the bottle service types. I did not know what I was getting myself into but drunkenly tried to go with the flow. You would think that meant I would have a ball - not so. Maybe it's just not my scene - a little too yuppy/King street crowd for me (if you know what I mean) but I tried to keep an open mind. They did let me in (presumably only because I was with the VIPs) with sneakers on, which was a pleasant surprise so they get serious brownie points for that. The place was absolutely packed with yuppies, as was to be expected, and I don't really know what kind of drinks they got with the bottle service, but whatever it was got me wasted fast. There is a nice outdoor seating area, some of it under an awning, with cushions to sit on and a small fireplace. When you go in the daytime it's nearly impossible to imagine that it turns into such a place at night. Music was pretty typical club music, fine to dance to, though it's a bit of an awkward set up as a club - you know, since it's a restaurant. 

Even for a pretentious place, it was only okay."}
{"text":"Impressed with the service and menu! Did not have high expectations but came in and a super dapper gentleman greeted us very warmly and lovingly and seated us.  What a great start already!  Immediately we got asked for our drinks and then the food!! glorious food! Butter poached salad and strip loin with Brussels sprouts on the side!  Very delicious and well executed.  Truly beyond my expectations.  And yes the music turned up at around 10:30pm and we got ready to leave but still the tunes were hopping!  Will be here again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for an event. This is a really beautiful place both indoors and out. The people that attended were more of a mature crowd, but were incredibly friendly and sociable. Highly recommend for dates or for groups. The music wasn't the greatest and wasn't very danceable, but has a nice lounge feel if you're into sitting or standing and chatting over a few beers listening to music."}
{"text":"Didn't go there to eat, I went there after work (late night) for drinks. Really great spot: nice mix between patio, bar, and seated areas. Drinks were a bit pricey (around 9 for a mixed drink) but the venue was upscale, and the crowd was relatively fancily dressed.

Dancing was not great, cover was $10 (Friday). Would go again!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here twice and both times were the same. The food is quite nice, and that's the only reason we returned the second time. Service is slow, it takes forever for someone to acknowledge you and take your order. They fail to inform you what comes with your dish. Mine came with bacon all over it and I'm a vegetarian. It didn't say anything about bacon on the menu (which is kinda vague). I was starving so I took the bacon off and ate it anyways, but that shouldn't have happened. The food is over priced and while I don't mind paying more for a great meal, it isn't worth it here. The poor waiters look gloomy as well. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Brassaii has still got it.  Classy, warm, chic, great ambiance, great decor, spaciousness, yet coziness.  We went for dinner and had the Ostrich medium-rare.  Delicious, tender, and a delight to chew and swallow.  The Lamb was also tender and flavorful.  Deserts were delicious and decadent.  An excellent place to take someone for their birthday."}
{"text":"RUDE!!

Okay, I love this restaurant usually. I go there often for brunch. I just called them  to see when they were closed for Tiff, so that I could try to schedule a day that would work best for reservations with my girlfriends. Trying to figure out 10 girls schedules, along with whether or not the preferred restaurant is even open is a challenge. 

I asked what days they were closed, she snapped and said \"for what date?\" I said -\" I don't know yet, we're trying to base it on when you're open\".  \"Well, I need to know a date. We're open some days and closed others\" (which is a pretty obvious response). I said \"If you could just tell me when you're closed that would be really helpful\". 

She said - \"Well - I don't know - call  back when you have a date\". 

Clearly they didn't care enough about our business, so we will pick a date and make a reservation elsewhere."}
{"text":"Located in king street a very happening place.   Not recommended for just dinner as menu is very limited.  The ambience is awesome and it conveys into a night club at 10.30pm.  Overall a great place which is a lit of fun with friends.  A must visit if you are doing a night out in town."}
{"text":"Visited on Thur Nov 27 at 9pm. They have a complimentary coat check at the front which is nice. We were promptly seated, place was about 1/3 full. The complimentary bread was quite good and warm, i assume it was made there.  It was a bit loud because of the band playing at a private party near the front. When the band wasn't playing it was nice and quiet to talk.

I ordered the salmon and the portion size was so small! They had 6 small pieces of fish not worth the price of $24? or so. (The dish looked amazing though.) It took 10 min to get our servers attention to get the bill near the end and the place wasn't that busy. If you're looking for a place where presentation of the food is important then come check this place out. In terms of portion size and value for food no."}
{"text":"By far the worst place to go on a saturday. I waited an hour in front of the line watching over 20 peoplebump ahead due to \"bottle service requests\" and no reservations guest lists\".  The line was only letting in people who were paying for bottle service. Disgusting.  I asked a lady who was working there for her name because she was incredibly rude to me..she said her name was \"Christine\"...like \"cher\" no last name. Rude. She said that the manager \"Sheena Bradley\" would be awaiting my email and then laughed at me. I made at least 8 people line leave with me.  I  am a professional working living on king west. I will be letting  a lot of peoople know about how horrible brassaii is. I will also let the allied beauty association know of the poor  customer service. This establishment is a know trash bar. I gave this place the benefit of the doubt... it is a trash bar."}
{"text":"Brunch at Brasaii - I always embrace the fact that there's no line here due to the size, the staff is ridiculously friendly however, the brunch menu was a bit bland. I had the Benedict that was served with steak. The sauce was tasty but the meat lacked flavour. I've been here for dinner and drinks and is always a reliable spot but brunch was half a thumb up."}
{"text":"Dim, dark, and overpriced food with small portion sizes"}
{"text":"I would love to share my experience at Brassia bar. My lady and I walked in to the she-she bar to have a drink and check out the Toronto nightlife \"scene\". We were dispatched to the the service bar. Ouch! However we met two awesome bartenders Dan and Orlando. 100% recommendation."}
{"text":"visiting from las vegas...on Valentines Day...oh it was sooooooooooooo wonderful. Great service from the greeting to the service to all the managers on duty, including the chef..we were really impressed, the food, my veal my husbands bison tenderloin,
candy bar, and the pictures... turned out great..not forgetting the sticky toffee desert
You know coming from Vegas and Gordon Ramsey promoting his sticky toffee desert
maybe should go to Toronto Canada to try Brassaii's. Will be back for sure and if ever
you should go to Toronto DO NOT FORGET TO GO TO BRASSAII!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with 6 other guests. This place is filled with completely rude staff and waitresses. The white female manager or supervisor asked us if all the guests arrived yet and rushed us to order food. We made reservations for 8:30pm and didn't get seated until 9:00pm. So how did she expect us to order right away. The manager got annoyed of us and asked our server to rush us again. I guess our server was a typical \"look down\" upon young guests because they seem like they can't afford anything on the menu. But regardless we got our orders in. After our food arrived the server never came back to check on us and we waved and yelled for her (loud atmosphere) multiple times and completely ignored us. Finally we got her attention for water refill and more drinks , you know the typical \"never got my water refilled that night\"scenario, yeah that happened . Food was decent, but very small portion. If you wanna party and dance , I recommend you go somewhere else, why have these staff ruin your night with friends. Never coming back."}
{"text":"A decent 4 stars.

Note: review of brunch only. 

I have never eaten here at night nor have I par-tay-ed.  

That said brunch is really decent. I've had the benny. But my real favourite is the potatoes...side dish with homemade mayo.  Even though it's a simple dish it is pretty sexy. 


Coffee...fresh juice. Bright, clean and fresh.  What's not to like."}
{"text":"Brassaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii... Was a favourite but then with the change in chef/ownership, it just was never the same!

But today, we (me and the group of 6) hung out on your patio to enjoy the lovely sun and the lovely patio. I gave you another shot, and was happy with most aspects.

Here's the run down:

1) Celebrating a birthday, Brassaii brought us complimentary sparkling wine (so class!!!) 

2) The waiter was LOVELY. Now I feel bad for not getting a name to give him a proper shout out. What a nice nice guy!

3) Bread, did nothing for me. Maybe because it was the last one in the basket (I came late) but it was a little verging on stale. - Sad face

4) Ordered the cobb salad... epic fail. Was not big enough and honestly, the bacon makes this dish. The value was not there. My peeps ordered the lasagna and burgers, those looked really good.

But you out classed me with the booze and the exceptional service... The food though, needs some work.

Gan bei!"}
{"text":"Strange menu with weird combinations and strange ingredients.  Do I really need a \"scotch pine air\" on my halibut?  And what the heck is \"black almond soil\"? The popcorn shrimp is actual popcorn (that's not even seasoned) with three large shrimp - so strange and not complimentary ingredients.  

The server was so helpful in recommending wine and starters. The crispy ribs are to die for and could easily make a meal out of those.  My steak was tough - lots of gristle and inedible bits.  My neighbour said her halibut was delicious and she finished every bite.

I brought a party of 10 and were seated at two different tables so we had to get up and walk to the other table if we wanted to speak to one of them - and they were those half-round tables, so if you were in the middle, you had to discommode two people to get out.  Then the two tables' dinners were delivered about an hour apart - my table was finished eating and then half an hour later, the other table finally got their food.  The manager was completely useless and a fool - just \"oh, that's the way it is\" and didn't offer an apology, dessert or kiss my *ss.  But, the great servers made it right and brought us all a glass of champagne and comp'd one bottle of wine.  

Dear Manager, when I'm dropping a grand at your place, you should do the right thing and at least show some concern that your service is lacking.  I do a lot of dinners and talk to a lot of people who entertain their customers.  I can guarantee I will not recommend Brassaii as a place to woo your associates.   I guess you got your eye on the younger crowd that come in to drink and dance - you know, the ones who share  drinks and order one appetizer for every 10 people in their group.  You must not be interested in the big spenders who will consistently return to good restaurants.  Don't make me embarrassed in front of my clients - you will never see me again.

Whoever owns this place should come in and see what's going on - you won't be able to sustain your investment at it's current rate."}
{"text":"The notorious \"Le Brunch\" held once a month on a Sunday afternoon. You may have seen it on insta, your friends may have talked about it. If you haven't experienced it yourself, well you're not really missing out on much. It seems everyone was there to celebrate a birthday or bachelorette. 

The price is $45 + tax and service surcharge which gets you an app, entree, dessert, and mimosa. I quickly realized that no one really comes here for the food. The food is comparable to a backyard BBQ,raw burger patties and all! Bottles are reasonable, you can snag a grey goose for $150. All bottles are delivered by a bottle bobbing, mini light saber wielding server. 

Around 3:30pm brunch transitions to day-club. Not much dancing happens, but if you stick around for long enough, you may be treated to a 'scandalous' performance. 

Truly a one time experience. Definitely not something I'm rushing to do again."}
{"text":"First time here for a dinner/date
It was a classy joint and had great date ambience and atmosphere.  Came here on a thursday and it turned into a dance/party vibe.  The food was great quality.  

Really happy and great place for a date spot with a great mix of music fun, food, and balance between conversation as well as dancing.
ideal."}
{"text":"We used to come here a fair bit and loved it! Orlando was a magician behind the bar and put on a show worth coming for. Went last night and even though the drinks were good, the atmosphere was not what it used to be. The entire dining area crowd also seems to be a little more down market from what it used to be.Used to have a real hip yet classy vibe, not now. Too many other choices in the area! Will be a while before I give it a try again"}
{"text":"was so-so for me.. had lunch and i thought it was pretty unmemorable..
tuna tartar, arugula salad, and corn chowder... all were just so-so.."}
{"text":"May have been the worst restaurant experience to date, and to top it off, it happened on mothers day, when we had a set reservation, on a day you want to be relaxing, enjoyable, and memorable for all mothers. A lovely atmosphere, though after waiting an hour and a half to be told that our meals will be a few minutes longer, but here are some complimentary mimosas, the atmosphere was little to be desired. Another twenty minutes later, we were told once again that our meals will be a few minutes longer, and unfortunately that was when our group decided it was time to leave. Up until this point, though enjoying each others company, we rarely saw our server, and a manager didn't even come to touch on our table until an hour and a half after we had to ask where the **** is our food. To see large parties come and be sat after you, be served before you, and leave the restaurant before you even receive any food whatsoever, is completely unacceptable by any means.I have worked in the service industry, this is not acceptable by any means. We weren't offered any sort of bread or pastries to nibble on in the waiting period, and when asked for even a cinnamon bun (an item on the prefixed menu) we were told, sure, but it would be 3-5 minutes. Ten minutes later with no cinnamon buns in sight, we had to leave, our mother's deserved a brunch that we had promised to take them for.  The floor manager had no training on how to handle any situation of this sorts, which is MIND BLOWING at a restaurant of this caliber-- needless to say, the business card she handed out to each of us as we left to receive a \"$20 gift card\" will more than likely never be used, I wouldn't want to waste anymore time sitting and waiting, hoping food will show up."}
{"text":"If I were blind, I would have given this place 1-star. I have heard so many great things over the years, but simply have never gone. I was invited to a birthday party there and the atmosphere was awesome; lots of laughs and what not. The venue looked great and the staff was attentive. The drink I ordered \"Hot Mess\" was great. If I only ordered drinks, this would have been a 5-star review. 

We waited for quite a long time to get our meals and when it all came we were mostly unimpressed. The only shining star was the octopus dish; I did not have it, so I cannot comment on its merits. I had the soup of the day, potato & leek, which was standard in flavour. The roaring disappointment were the fries. They were incredibly bitter and burnt af, the aioli may as well been supermarket purchased, and I was longing for the parmesan. Perhaps getting a main would have led to a more favourable experience (probably not based on the reactions of most of the other guests).

There are so many great places to check out on King West, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that turns into a nightclub, I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was here.  It definitely has that nightlife feel (dark, on the loud side; dress up if you don't want to feel out of place), so it's not somewhere I'd bring, say my parents to for dinner, or even a date, but it's great for a group of friends having a fun night out on the town. If I was just planning to go out for dinner I'd probably pick somewhere else but it's super convenient as a place to stick around for drinks after. I'd say it's a good blend of the best of both worlds.  

To eat, I had the grilled octopus to start and the scallops and sweet peas as my main.  While I was not completely blown away by either dish, both were very good dishes that I would order again. Not the best ever, but definitely better than I expected.

I can see why it's 3 stars when being evaluated as a standalone restaurant, but for a fun night out, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place seems to be going down fast. I remember years ago this place was great and the food never failed. I recently visited this restaurant for the first time for couple of years and for the quality, the food was overpriced.

On top of that, the chef is a prima donna who doesn't like to change anything - even if it causes problems for people with allergies.  Everything combined makes it unlikely for me to return. Sorry but there are so many restaurants better than this in Toronto. The setting is beautiful but let's not forget - people go there to eat."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Loooved the white sangria! Best white sangria ever!! For apps, I had the Brasaii salad. IMO, salad wasn't as great - the Brasaii salad was just your average Caesar salad. The mushroom risotto that I had did make up for it though! The crème brûlée was just as spectacular! I wasn't too thrilled about the facilities - it just wasn't well-equipped and the stalls were really tiny. In terms of the ambiance and decor, I love the loft-like interior and the neon signs - it gives off a hip, tasteful vibe without being overly obnoxious. Overall, Brasaii really lived up to its hype and I'll definitely be coming back again when I'm not broke!"}
{"text":"Good food, not amazing. This place use to be real really good when they had the back room parties a few years back - since then its gotten pretty popular and totally not my crowd / scene."}
{"text":"Delightful! Thanks to all the staff at Brassaii for maintaining high standards across the board. My favourite so far has to be the house made pasta, butternut squash, roasted mushroom and truffle Ravioli. In the late hours, try their Beef Carpaccio, Flatbread and more!"}
{"text":"When you combined a sophisticated restaurant turned night club, that's the ambiance of Brassaii. I could spend hours here eating dinner.

Forager's Toast ($20) Toasted brioche, goat's butter with crumbled goat's cheese from the same goat, foraged mushrooms (chanterelles), fresh thyme, black truffle shavings, white truffle oil - This tastes amazing!!!

Octopus salad ($22) Mediterranean brined octopus, olives, duck fat confit potatoes, crispy guanciale (jowl) - very refreshing though on the pricey side

Brussell Sprouts w/ Bacon ($9) - nice side with a lot of flavour

{"text":"The first thing you notice when you walk inside is that the restaurant is spacious and tastefully decorated. It's a good place for a date or meeting with friends and family.
Been here twice for their fixed price brunch. This place is a great choice for downtown brunch because it is 25$ for 3 courses and there is no crazy brunch line! Unfortunately, their fixed price menu doesn't have that many options."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this morning. It was wonderful! The hostess greeted us with a huge smile which started things off on the right foot. Our server, John was quick, friendly and attentive. I've heard lots of good things about Brassaii and it lived up to them. The food was delicious, fresh and decadent (pancakes!). I'm looking forward to trying it out for dinner. Bravo John, great service! LP"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots to hit while in Toronto.  I've only had dinner once here, and it was when I reserved for a larger group.  It was awesome.  The service was fantastic and the food was tasty.  

What's cool about this place is that it starts hoppin later on in the evening and in my opinion one of the best spots to hang out on a week night.  I've only been in the summer when the patio and outdoor lounge is open.  

If you don't eat dinner there, it's definitely a great stop during your night."}
{"text":"Worst service - overshadows everything else.  I love the space - totally cool - and if they didn't have that venue, they would be out of business, because everything else is mediocre.  Have been there many times over the last few years, usually at someone else's decision (I would never book myself).  Have been to big events, including a wedding, intimate dinners, group dinners, corporate cocktail - each time I am shocked by how rude and unhelpful the staff are.   At one corporate dinner for 10 they tried to tell us we could not order dessert because there was another group taking over our table, after they had taken 1.5 hours to bring out our mains - completely unacceptable.

There are so many better options food-wise in the area, that I would recommend you pass this by - but understand if you may want to check out the patio / venue because it is pretty special.  Maybe go for a lunch and be warned that you may leave frustrated."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentines and they surely went out of their way to make it special. First, they have a complimentary flute of wine, a candy bar and a photo booth. I'd say I was impressed with it before we even sat down.

The food, I had the bison tenderloin ($40), it was much more tender than I expected. And I really like the crispness and shape of the king oyster mushrooms, it looked like pineapples with the creases they cut into it.

The scallops, 4 big scallops on top of chorizo. They were very good, but the one thing is it's really salty. Like keep drinking water.

We also had the ravioli, which is a good started to share between two people. 7 pieces of ravioli with butternut squash and truffle oil. Lots of butternut square all around it, was very tasty.

One thing I wasn't a fan of was the aisles of the tables had big pillars in the middle. And it's hard to go around them because peoples' chairs are like right there. Gotta gently squeeze between a pole and a chair to get through.

The wait staff was attentive and just beneath the border of being too attentive, so I was ok with it. They had a waitress come around with a cocktail cart, so while I really like this idea, if she had more area to maneuver around the pillars, she could actually bring the cart around and perhaps she'd be more likely to have someone order a drink.

The prices are a bit expensive, but I expected that. I'd say though it was a good meal and worth it."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a Thursday night with a few friends at around 9 pm.  There were three of us initially, but we were expecting three more to join later on, so we were told that we could only be seated inside.  Apparently there was a wait-list to be seated outside on the patio even though we noticed several clean, empty tables.  When inquiring about those tables, we were told by the hostess, putting on her fakest smile ever, that parties (which we couldn't observe) were about to be seated there.  So without further argument, we proceeded inside Brassaii (admittedly, the walkway to the actual building is one of the highlights of the whole venue), where we were promptly seated.

Inside was a pretty swank decor, including a bar laced with a row Grey Goose bottles.  The atmosphere was fairly loud, and so it was difficult for us to even hear one another from across the table.  Several of us had already eaten, so we ordered a few appetizers (the flatbread, burrata and charcuterie).  None were especially outstanding.  Of the two desserts we ordered (the biscotti & truffles -- where were the truffles?, and the creme brulee), the creme bruleee was more satisfying and came with a pound cake.

On our way out, we observed that the patio area had filled up with a very good looking crowd; they literally looked like they had jumped out of pages of an Abercrombie catalog.  I guess that explains why we weren't allowed to sit outside."}
{"text":"Congenial atmosphere. Very busy but friendly service. Nice for an informal lunch or dinner. Menu is respectable. Open style decor lends itself to a social atmosphere."}
{"text":"If I could refrain from providing this restaurant with a start I would have. 

Went for burger week with the hubby. Arrived at approx 7pm on a Wednesday night. Ordered a Hairy Greyhound (? not 100% sure of the exact drink name) for $14. It was served in a thin tall glass and tasted like liquid salt. Appetizing I know.

Ordered their Lamb Burger with wild-leek aioli, heirloom tomato, housemade pickles, and feta cheese, all on an Ace Bakery bun. $15 with fries. 

Almost an hour passes and still no burger. The Waiter brings over complementary sparkling wine...but after the greyhound fiasco I don't want to even try it. 

A full hour after ordering our 2 burgers they come out and...*FAIL!* it was awful. the Proportions were completely off. The Lamb was a circular over cooked and charred brick that is currently weighting down my stomach. I reluctantly ate 1/2 the burger as I was STARVING after waiting an hour (my hubby did the same). 

The waiter came over and asked if we wanted them to be wrapped up. I told him that they (the burgers) needed to go away. He asked if I enjoyed them. I said it was bad, and if I wasn't so hungry I probably wouldn't have had any of it. 

The waiter comped the two burgers and we left very dissatisfied, and will never go back."}
{"text":"Very impressed with Brassai, was there for boyfriends birthday for one of the Let brunch events and we had a great time and got a bunch of champaign and came back 3.5 months later for my birthday and they remembered us and offered a free bottle of champagne so I rate their service 5/5. I've always had a good time and will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"The menu and prices of an intimate romantic restaurant without the intimacy and romance. Brassaii is huge. And tables are arranged to pack 'em in cafeteria style. Don't let volume volume volume fool you into thinking this is a mid-range bistro. Mains start at about $20 and go up exponentially from there. This is more of a rollicking, high end urban kitchen for people who want to throw down large with a group of friends after a promotion or their year end bonus.

Service wise the place is top notch. They'll even walk you right to the bathrooms. Interiors had some nice touches like an exposed and curiously lit elevator the renovators actually found, apparently, bricked off during renovations.

Food wise ostrich was an intriguing menu item. I was going to get it as a main but Pension Babe chose it as an app to share. As an app the thinly slicked flightless bird melted in your mouth. I wonder now what it would have been like as a main. Pension Babe got the sword fish and I got the ahi tuna. I've had better ahi in Seattle. The sides could be way more plentiful for the prices."}
{"text":"Went to Brassaii with friends for brunch on the weekend...everything was meh.  I asked for them to leave out the goat cheese in the vegetarian sandwich.  The server said the sandwiches are premade therefore my request couldnt be accommodated.  what the heck?  why is a simple sandwich ever pre-made?  I ordered it anyway and it sucked.  I asked about the orange to see if it is freshly squeezed...they asked me to define fresh.  LOL!  Also, the fruit salad was like thawed frozen fruit salad.  I was very unimpressed and not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Perhaps a case of style over substance, this venue stimulates the senses from the time you enter with a stylish outdoor courtyard, and trendy foyer.  Exposed brick, and high ceilings create an impression of space accented with natural light from huge plate-glass windows.  Many tables, that were quickly filled after the noon business lunch crowd descended.

The tables were appropriately spaced, and despite the noise level, a balance between \"busy\" and \"chaotic\" was achieved and a business lunch could be comfortably achieved.

The menu was good mixing popular lunch fare with some creative items; I had the lobster salad sandwich (average);  the frites (good) came fresh-cut and seasoned with Parmesan. Dessert was a disappointment (cheesecake pie) as the pastry overwhelmed the cheesecake filling, and was a messy proposition at best.

Service was attentive up until the end, when we waited too long for the bill.

I would go back, but with so many great options in the King-Spadina area, it might be a while.

Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.... They sift the mojitos and leave out the mint leaves... Would be cool but it wasn't. $11 for sugar and rum and I am just not into this place at all.
Seriously, hand over the location to something better or step it up a notch."}
{"text":"My friend and I didn't go for the food. Just stopped by for the lounge/bar after the kitchen had closed down one Friday night after midnight. Drinks are priced at $11 a highball cocktail which was actually a relief after we wasted a couple of covers for some pretty dive clubs/bars. (They don't serve their drinks in a plastic cups for goodness' sake which is always a relief. The glasses always tell you what kind of place it's going to be.) 

We danced a bit, the music was alright, the crowd was the older scene - definitely no drunk college kids but people who looked like they had decent day jobs. People dress nicer so it's not the kind of place to go if you just want to get trashed/party really hard that night. And lots of random corporate couple hook-ups on the dance floor as we were dancing - they kind of just found each other.

Did my friend and I have fun? Yes.
Was it a bad experience? No.
Anything to rave about it? No.
Would I go back? Sure but not any time soon.

P.S. Don't forget to tip well; the bartender lady got pretty angry."}
{"text":"I went here for Mother's Day and she absolutely loved it. The dishes cost an arm and a leg ($3 per asparagus, really?) but damn, it was a culinary delight.  I've only been here once and they seem to change up their menu every week depending on what fresh ingredients they can get their hands on.  I'd love to go back here again. Check out my full rave review with food photos too (pics tell all!): http://kiwianne.com/brassaii-restaurant-lounge-a-weekly-culinary-thrill/"}
{"text":"Terrible stack, the waiter had attitude and food was extremely salty. Will not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Brassaii has a fantastic brunch, beautiful patio space, and wonderful service. We stumbled upon it on a recent trip to Toronto and requested a table for 4 outside on a gorgeous Sunday late morning. The servers were extremely accommodating and moved an umbrella to give us some shade. Our meals were delicious - two of us had the 2 eggs any way with turkey sausage and multigrain toast, one person had an omelet, and one person had chicken and waffles. We all raved about our meals. The coffee was awesome and the servers kept it flowing until we all had a major caffeine buzz. The iced coffee was AWESOME. Even after we finished our meals and they cleared our plates, they kept refilling our coffees and allowing us to sit and shmooze rather than suggesting the check, dessert, etc. Overall a wonderful dining experience, particularly with the excellent service. Highly recommend this spot for a great brunch outside!"}
{"text":"So this time, I wanted to try out Brassaii on a non-Summerlicious occassion.  My friend got a coupon from LivingSocial, so I said, \"Why not?\"  I had such a great experience here last time during Summerlicious, might as well try it again.

We went on a Thursday night.  Our reservations were at 6 PM.  We quickly got seated, and it wasn't too packed.  However, it *did* get more busy around 7:30 or so.

Our waitress was very friendly and kind.  I was laughing at the fact that she asked me and my (guy) friend whether or not we were celebrating something.  I just gave her this confused look, and joked with her that we were celebrating the fact that it was a Thursday.

The décor is really nice.  It has a very modern and eclectric feel to it.  Decorated mainly with black 

We ordered the following:
1) FOIE GRAS (pan seared + brioche french toast + sumac berry and squash compote):  I found this to be absolutely deicious.  The sqaush compote was very well done.  However, it wasn't as good as the foie gras that I had in Montreal at Chez L'epicier.  It would've been nice to have something a tad sweet to offset the salty taste of the foie gras.

2) VENISON (venison chop + venison sausage + marscapone cream corn + beet foam):  My friend had ordered this and he had no complaints.  I never got to try it, so I can't provide a review for this.

3) BEEF FILET (grilled filet of beef tenderloin + black truffle potato gnocchi + foie gras jus):  The integration of foie gras jus had totally hit the spot with the beef filet.  However, I wasn't fully pleased with the grilled filet, mainly because it was slightly charred at the corners.  The potato gnocchi was very good though -- something that I've never had before.

Due to the amounts of meat that I had, I once again was unable to try any dessert.

The place is slightly pricey, but it's nice to treat yourself to something fancy once in a while. ;)"}
{"text":"Music was way too loud at Le Brunch.  Many staffs were rude and food was average.  I wouldn't go back :( The TV dinner was serve in actual plastic containers which looks like leftover takeout"}
{"text":"I have mixed opinions on this place. 
Thursday: No cover. Chill vibe. Fun DJ. Sexy people. 
Friday: $10 cover. Chill vibe. No dance floor. Tiny room get rammed with people.
Saturday: $10-20 cover (I think). Party time. Back dance floor is open. 

Age: 25 plus. For women, they may let you in, but men will have no luck. 

It's a nice place to stop for drinks (or in the summer, hang on the beautiful patio) on a Thursday night - when there is no cover. Oddly, they charge $10 cover on Fridays but don't open the back dance floor area. It gets rammed in there and there are too many couches/giant chairs and tables to manoeuvre around. On Saturdays, it can be pretty fun. The back room opens up and there's a big dance area. However, good luck making your way out of it! They fill past capacity and it's nearly impossible to get out the tiny doorway all the way at the front and bouncers are standing guard at the back of the room in front of what makes sense as a passageway, but apparently is off-limits because it links into the closed-off dining room.

Overall, Thursdays are my favourite night here. Always lots of sexy, well-dressed business men and women enjoying overpriced cocktails and a few people usually bust a move in between the chairs. Friday nights are usually a wash. Might as well pay more cover and go somewhere with a real dance floor."}
{"text":"Went as part of a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. The server was a bit rude, and seemed upset that we were mostly interested in ordering drinks and apps. I did end up ordering shrimp and popcorn from their limited menu, and it was disappointing to say the least! The custom drink was okay, and I was happy about that. Wanted to try their desserts but they didn't even have any good options!
We hung out later in the dance area but the music was not that great, so head out in about an hour or so.. 
Patio seemed nice, but we were not able to get seats there, so perhaps next time we can check that out. 
Overall an okay place to hang out for a few drinks but nothing great!"}
{"text":"worse customer service ever. 
Manager on duty was rude. She didn't care that I had negative feelings about this place when I said that I would never come back again!
Restaurant has gone downhill since they renovated!!"}
{"text":"A beautiful place for fine dinning, the food was good, especially their bread, feel like just made it for you. The Mushroom soup was tasty but they put butter in it, made it more fatten lol main course scallop dish was yummy. Oh and their white wine was awesome."}
{"text":"I happen to be taken there on a Wednesday night for drinks after dinner. As we were not a regulars, we had to line up but in about 5 minutes we were let in. Please be sure, you will be charged a cover of $10 (I don't know other days but Wednesdays you will). It is, really a good bar (bartenders very attentive, what you don't find in Toronto very often lately). Crowd is diverse and on the classy side. If you are expecting a lounge, it is not the place for you, it is loud and vibrant. The only reason for the 3 stars is because it is nothing extraordinary, but I have to say, if you happen to be in Toronto, head down there on Wednesday, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends for girls night out. We thought the place looked stunning. Very nice ambiance and perfect for dates or night out. We ordered a pitcher of sangria to start and it was delicious. Large chunks or fruits in the glass served with a straw. Then we shared a charcuterie plate which was awesome. I loved their cheeses and the meats were great. We also devoured the warm bread they served with churned butter. We enjoyed it so much we ordered another round. The stand out dish was the short ribs. It was pull apart tender and the flavors were wonderful. The striploin was alright. It didn't wow us and the sauce was a bit on the salty side. The flatbread was also amazing and if you like carbs, I highly recommend it. Overall, I really like this restaurant. I think they've made it a lot better than it was a few years ago."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Brassaii a few times between 2004 and Present. I keep forgetting why I don't like it - and now I remember: I find it \"tries\" a bit too hard to be somewhere between the decor of NYC Soho chic, and Euro - and the split-personality spills over to their menu as well. Aside from the fact it's extremely over-priced, the wait staff are generally cardboard without so much as a hint of having any personality let alone any opinion as to what they'd recommend.
  Plastic, Vacuous without Substance, Contrived, Pseudo-Pretentious...and that's just the Food."}
{"text":"Just came here for drinks. Off King, but hidden so it was a little hard to find in the dark. 

Patrons here really dress up at night and they were all really good looking. A morbidly obese and short girl should have not been in the mix of patrons here. I can picture said people hiring a limo and trekking down here to have dinner'n'drinks here.

Glasses of wine are reasonably priced, lounge area is nice.

It was a-ok. Not my scene so I'll be fine if I don't come back for drinks.
Would maybe like to try their brunch."}
{"text":"The derp moment when you worry about being 30min late for a reservation and then walking into an almost empty restaurant.  ...but the decor is beautiful.  We sat on at a row of tables right across from the kitchen (one of the kitchens?), which is in open space.  A man who probably was the manager came by to ask us how the food was a couple times during our meal, mostly cuz we were the only two people there besides a group of girls their for a bridal shower ... but the service was  excellent.  We had our main server, Andrew, who was extremely attentive and joked around with us, gave really helpful suggestions.  Also made sure we were never thirsty, which is a thing for me cuz  I actually hate asking for water at restaurants

We also had a couple other servers bringing us food and bread, presumably because they had nobody else to serve at the time. LOL.  To be fair, it was an early dinner for a Saturday at around 5, I'm sure Brassaii gets turnt up at night because their music even during the late afternoon is great.  Played deadmau5 and some other EDM mixes, loved the music.

The foooood-
The bread they served us was amazing.  It wasn't your normal whole wheat or raisin bread, but fancier almond-grained ones that was so good we had to ask for another plate.  The second time it was a different kind of bread; all of Brassaii's fread is house-made and fresh out of the oven.  SO GOOD.

Started off with the charcuterie board.  The cheeses were pretty strong but all the cured meats are delicious.  I really liked the fruit chutney, but some of the house made pickled vegetables were not my thing, a bit too sour.  Overall, really enjoyed it for the cheese and meats :)

For the mains, we tried
- Tagliolini:  three cheese + fresh pasta + beef & veal meatballs + tomato sugo + fresh basil.  I was a huge fan of their pasta, the meatballs were pretty heavy and filled with cheese, but I loved the tomato sugo on the pasta so much.  Seems simple, but there are more than a couple layers of flavours and it's not just a simple pasta dish at all.   
- Shortrib: black pepper crusted short rib + mash + fresh figs + paprika powder + monteiro cheese.  This dish was pretty complex, there were so many sections of ingredients on my plate that I wasn't sure what to eat with what at first.  The thing I noticed about their mains at Brassaii is the complexity of flavouring in their dishes.  The fig sat beside the rib which was on top of a bed of monteiro cheese.  The combination of two tasted great, three tasted better.  It's just a really creative combination of ingredients and I enjoyed the well braised shortribs

For the dessert, our server suggested the millk chocolate pavlova.  For one, the dessert looked freakin' beautiful.  I LOVED the hazelnut semifreddo cubes.  The ice cream was delicious and the cake at the bottom tasted great with the passion fruit cream.  

Brassaii manages to combine so many different flavours into their each of their menu items.  4.5 stars :)"}
{"text":"To summarize my experience: This isn't the Brassaii I remember. I used to come here quite often years ago for the dinner and late-night lounge experience, and I recall having a great time!

However, I recently dined here for a business dinner and was disappointed overall. We had a private room booked, which was closed off from the main room by double doors; however, despite the fact that there were no other patrons in the restaurant, the outside music level (and inside AC noise level) were quite disruptive.

We were provided with a set course dinner menu, with the option of either a caesar salad or mushroom soup to start, followed by either linguine, a chicken dish, salmon, or beef tenderloin, and a sorbet, creme brulee or chocolate mousse to finish. 

In regards to the starters, the caesar salda was quite overdressed and doused with cheese. I was expecting my mushroom soup to be a creamy bisque; however, I was quite surprised when I received a dish of mushrooms floating in a very salty broth, with not much flavour. My colleagues had the chicken which was 'tough,' and the tenderloin which was well-liked overall, although the vegetables were quite bland. I chose the salmon which was overcooked, and presented upon lentils which were flavorless. I doused them in the hot sauce that I had requested (tobasco), but still, the meal could not be helped.

As for beverages, we had the house white and red, and as I am a fan of reds, I chose this option. Although I could not see the label on the wine being poured, this particular red wasn't particularly appealing. I'm a fan of more robust and well-rounded flavours and this wine just didn't seem to fit the bill.

I could not stay for dessert but asked for the chocolate mousse to go. This was a chocolate cake base with a chocolate mousse on top, finished with fresh raspberries. Overall, not particularly unique or flavourful. 

Overall, I must say that given my past experiences here, I was disappointed. The staff were great, however, and were the standout. From the reception, to the meal service, the service was attentive and hospitable. 

That being said, I was disappointed overall in returning here with high hopes that this venue had continued to maintain and even progress in this  highly competitive market in Toronto."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch spot that meets all my weekend brunch criteria:
- Convenient location
- Takes reservations (by phone or online via OpenTable, which I love) and NO crazy lineups, you can show up and be pretty sure you will get a table
- Good variety including some lighter options (I eat brunch out almost every weekend -- if I had stuffed French toast every time, it would not be healthy... but they DO have stuffed French toast on the menu in case you were wondering)
- Nice atmosphere. Not too crowded or noisy. 
- Good, reliable service
- Reasonable prices (mains are ~$10-14)

Also of note: 
- The private dining room is gorgeous! Would be a great, albeit expensive, place to host a dinner party. 
- Coat/umbrella check
- They have newspapers as well as issues of Air Canada's magazine EnRoute (random)
- Washrooms are super-nice

I had the Brassaii mimosa, which was lovely. There's peach schnapps in there, which adds a nice sweetness to the orange juice. Next, the egg white omelette with spinach and ricotta, served with toast, grilled tomato, and turkey bacon + a small dish of fruit. It was nice because there's a bit of everything! Also, nice that there is a healthy option other than the usual fruit/granola/yogurt and that they don't charge extra for an egg white omelette like many other places do. The DC had the Florentina which was presented really nicely. 

If you are super-hungry, there are a bunch of possible add ons that sounded tempting (like mini donuts!) but I'm glad I just had one dish because it was pretty filling. 

Definitely recommend this place for a nice, relaxing weekend brunch! (Have been here on a Saturday night as well... different story, totally different vibe. I much prefer this place during the day.)"}
{"text":"Lame ...waited in line for 1.5 hr and they keep letting in groups of 4 or 5 or 8 and we are only 2 and the rest of our group is inside...."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch and lunch and have enjoyed each time immensely.  The space is dynamic and has many moods, from light and airy to intimate and warm to sexy and cosmopolitan.  This restaurant is flexible and multifaceted in the spaces which their diners can eat and enjoy themselves.  Also the event space is something I hope to one day be able to use.  

The food, well it has yet to dissapoint me.  The cheese plate with the in-house made Parmesan shortbread crackers are impressive.  The chicken and waffles are a lovely and lemony version which is refreshing and still very tasty.  There is something for everyone and I always have left full and on the verge of a happy food coma!  Come for the food and enjoy the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Went here for strictly for drinks and the scene. Turns into a club around 11:30pm. Waitress told us that Wed night and Sat night were the hot nights. Drinks were fine but typically overpriced.  Tables were mostly reserved for bottle service. Waitresses were scantily dressed as expected with this type of yuppie atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good brunch (no idea about dinner). The portions are a good size, and the menu items are fairly interesting. I think they change the menu up from time to time, as the menu was not up to date with what was on the website. A lot of the prices were a little higher than the current website menu I saw, but that can be expected with the price of beef and pork up.

I had the Fried Chicken and Herb Waffles. Comes with a bunch of chicken. (white meat was deboned, dark meat was not). Also comes with a side of maple syrup and chicken gravy. It was feeling and satisfying. The other plates I saw at our tables looked great as well.

The space is huge, so you probably won't need a reservation. It also wasn't too busy when we were there."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!I waited outside for over an hour and I still didn't get in. The music is really bad here and the people are snooty...If you want to have the Jersey Shore experience in your life...this is the place."}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place and have always wanted to check it out. When I heard we were going there for my office Holiday Party I was ecstatic at the notion. We got a private room so we weren't disturbed and the staff were really on point at getting us everything we needed.

We ended up going with a set menu but the offerings were great! I tried the risotto and it was great (it just needed about a minute more in the pan but was otherwise was fantastic). I heard the tenderloin was great too.

They make a killer Gin and Tonic and offer Moscow Mules (sans copper cup) too which I haven't had in forever!

Great setting, great location, great food! A-OK in my books!"}
{"text":"My date and I went for the first night of winterlicious 2014. Although this was one of the pricier menus ($45), portions were a good size and both of us left feeling satisfied.  Staff were very friendly and helpful with any questions we had.
At about 9 o'clock the front of the restaurant was converted into a night club while dinner guests were finishing up their meals.  Not sure if this is a regular occurrence on Friday nights, but it makes it a great option if you want to do a dinner and dancing combo night. Not to mention the fact that you bypass any line or cover for the night.
Glad this restaurant was a winterlicious participant as I doubt I would have gone otherwise however I'll definitely be back.
Also, it's located in an alleyway.  Be aware when looking for it!"}
{"text":"Good: It's not cool, I know, but I'm a sucker for top 40 and nineties music :)

Better: The food was surprisingly good! (I say surprisingly, because I've had brunch here and it was really bad.) The proscuitto was better than Buca's, and the beet and burrata salad was perfectly put together. 

BEST: This place is a tad less pretentious than others on the strip, and I appreciate that they don't make a big fuss about letting people in. I chose this location for a surprise party, knowing the out-of-town friends would have no problem getting in after eleven.

Don't get me wrong, there is an air of King Street douchebaggery about the place, especially as the night wears on. But it's nothing compared to Spice Route.

Now, here are some less than stellar comments about this place: The service is quite poor. The bartenders are friendly enough, but servers are pointedly disinterested. 

The food and drinks are overpriced... perhaps to recoup for the unnecessarily abundant staff and flashy decor? 

See above re: douchebaggery.

Dollars: The charcuterie plate, beet salad, bubbly water and 3 drinks cost about $130ish. 6 shots of Jagermeister (don't ask) cost a whopping $54."}
{"text":"Good place to come with friends if you like standing around, drinking, and talking, or sitting around, eating, and talking.  There is a dance floor (went on a Friday) but no one was dancing, they were just (you guessed it) standing around and talking. Good crowd (25+ mainly) and the patio part was fun.  My boyfriend and I always find some strangers to talk to so people r aren't super rude or anything, but seriously, it gets boring when there's a lot of talking..."}
{"text":"Hurr Hurr Hurr. I think Brassaii has lost the plot. Actually, I'm not sure they ever had the plot in the first place judging by how downhill things have went since they've opened. The saddest thing about this place is their business model seems to rely on inconsistency, hiring staff who have no clue or appreciation for providing decent customer service and hiring guest DJ's with thumbs up their butts - seriously, it was one of the WORST DJ sets I have ever experienced in my life, and I am a pretty reasonable and open minded person when it comes to music. I wish I knew who you were so I could shame you into giving up your career as a DJ, cause gawd you suck so bad buddy. NOBODY was dancing on the floor, like, it was hella awkward. Is the fact that no one dances to your mixing or song choices perhaps a clue as to how BAD YOU ARE AT WHAT YOU DO. Just go home DJ, go home and never come back. Go to DJ school or something. Shit.

As for the folks that just love it here or have had a wonderful experience, congrats to you. You either experienced Brassaii on a VERY GOOD Day/Night, can't tell what good taste is from a hole in the ground filled with horse shit, or are are too busy molesting people with your DIRTY DIRTY eyes or grabby hands, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

On that fateful night, we slide up to the rope, wait a few minutes, get let in, pay cover and slink our way to the dance floor. Despite being rainy and cold that night, there was no coat check; I had to stash my umbrella in a hidden dark spot and hope no one would jack it. It was also totally packed and coat check probably would have made a decent amount of money regardless. So, no coat check on your busiest week night is a dumb ass policy.

So we carve out a spot on the dance floor wait for the DJ to play something good. We wait. And wait, and it eventually gets to a point where I want to tear the skin off my face because this guy's set is so bad. He plays Fat Lip by Sum41. This fucking DJ plays Mall Punk at an \"upscale\" club. ARE YOU FOR REAL. And Immediately I am off it. Then the DJ plays Dark Horse by Katy Perry, which is kinda a shite song to dance to? What are you gonna do? Keep dipping low for the whole song cause its to damn slow to get any rhythm going? And after about 40 seconds of Dark Horse, he drops the bass. Aw cool, thanks guy. He plays the danceable part of this song and then switches right over to oldies song...that you also can't dance to. And then he drops the bass for 30 seconds, and then switches to the next song. Like jesus christ, not only does this git have horrible taste in music, he can't mix for HIS LIFE. 

Dear Brassaii, please take the money you paid to this DJ, and instead, donate it to your local DJ school for underpriviledged children, so Toronto does not have to deal with dirkweeds like the DJ you hired to spin on June 11th 2014. The world would be a better place.

My pal and I reached such a level of disgust that we just wanted to express our disappointment. So my friend approached a bouncer and asked to speak to a manager, he said to \"send an e-mail\" which is basically a wave off. Cool, thanks guy. So we walk around and find another bouncer and ask to speak to a manager. After some waiting we are told that the 3 managers on duty are all \"currently unavailable\" - code phrase for \"no one actually cares about what you think buzz off.\" So as a consolation prize, they get us the ~Head Hostess~ who for the record SUCKS AT HER JOB. My friend is pretty articulate and expressed her disdain for paying 10 dollars cover to stand around and witness a DJ suck at his job. And all the hostess could muster up is what she learned at HOSTESS SCHOOL, because she repeated this by rote \"Well I'm sorry you feel that way.\" Uh huh, we are sorry we feel this way too, can you please do something about it? Isn't that part of your job? But she kept going on and on about how sorry she was we felt that way. SNORE. She could have at least pretended to care, or perhaps say she would make sure to mention it to her manager. At least act as if customer complaints matter, even in the slightest. It would be miles above what happened. But no, this hostess kept looking up (likely into her empty brain to PERHAPS come up with something useful to say) and what we got was :

Hostess: \"Well, um, like...did you read the flyer for the event? The DJ is as advertised.\"

Who. The. Fuck. looks at flyers for events at clubs and is like \"OH DAMN, DJ SHIT AND STICKS IS PLAYING BRASSAII, WE GOTZ TO GO PLAYA. GRAB YO PLAYBOIS AND LETS HIT UP THE CLUB. 

What's listed on the flyer is irrelevant. You hired an incompetent person to play music. No one looks at flyers. PUHLEASE.

Hostess: \"Well I think you are wrong about the DJ. I think he is great.\"

Ahahahahahahaha. Aw Christ. I. Can't. Even.

In conclusion: Brassai is run and staffed by people with thumbs up their bung-holes that think you are wrong about YOUR OWN NEGATIVE experiences at their establishment. Lolz"}
{"text":"Went last night with a group of roughly 15 for a friends birthday. We had reservations for 8:30. Seated fairly quickly, and shortly after a server came to offer sparkling or still water. Because of our party size we had a set menu. Options were an appetizer of either soup of the day (which the server didn't know what it was) or ceaser salad. Entree choices were steak, salmon or chicken and desserts were Creme Brulee or cheesecake. Long story short we ordered our food at 9pm and didn't receive the entrees until 1030. When we finally did two of the guests did not come and they said it would be out shortly. Finally 30 mins later when everyone else was finished eating the two other meals came, now starving my friend went to eat her salmon and it was completely raw! Sent food back, manager apologized and removed the two late meals from the bill. Food was mediocre at best. Not terrible but not great. Steak meal was the best of the choices. After a not great meal I was excited to get my raspberry cheesecake. Favourite dessert and generally always really good. Arrived looking and tasting like a bar of cream cheese. Very disappointing. Finally at midnight we finished and went to the bar side where we had reserved a booth with bottle service. No complaints about that, our waitress was great. Club was fun with an older crowd and a mixture of top 40 music. Overall I would never return to brassaii for a meal. Service was EXTREMELY slow. Club was fun."}
{"text":"****Please be sure to read the reviews hidden by yelp, they are almost all one star reviews. Not sure why yelp has hidden/not recommended these reviews****

Went here for dinner/dancing with friends and this place is a total wasteland of 905ers and douche bags. Where good taste and common decency go to die. Horrifyingly bad. Or maybe you are supposed to get really drunk and fall down and stuff at clubs?

The dinner:
There is no actual vegetarian option on the menu so they offer to take the meat out of one of the pasta dishes, replace the meat with nothing and then still charge you the same price for a dish that is obviously lacking its \"star\" ingredient. meh at best.

Our server was very nice and attentive (that gets this place its 2nd star)

The dancing:
Just generic top 40 crap and a whole lot of ladies with a boat load of make-up and tight skinny dresses. Also everyone seemed very short, both the men and women, and I'm not even that tall. Just an odd observation, do what you will with that information. 

I see no need to return to this place ever."}
{"text":"Oh, Brassaii... A dining locale full of people who think they're cooler than me (they aren't).  I have only been here for brunch, twice, and it's a nice place.  A little TOO nice, if you ask me.

The good:
- their brunch is good!
- the portions are big
- the price is reasonable
- the patio is quite nice

The bad:
- I never feel cool enough to be here
- I never, NEVER like my coffee
- I have always found the service very... meh to bad

The weird-and-funny:
I switched seats once to get out of the sun, and the waiter has his only moment of interest/perkyness/showing any sign of being alive when he laughed and asked if I was trying to trick him (obviously I was).

Would I go here again?
Sure, if I was in the neighbourhood for brunch with Sarah T's crew.  Otherwise no.  Even though it's okay."}
{"text":"He glanced at the glowing dial of his watch through the gathering dusk: late.  He would not have the time to prepare as elaborately as he'd planned.  It was time for a bit of improvisation.

Stopping briefly at the entrance to the courtyard ringed by brick and wrought iron, he harvested a few flowers that sat in a carefully tended planter; their yellow petals shone even in the shadows.  The flowers wouldn't mind, he thought - they'd soon be staring into a face more beautiful and bright than even theirs.  He fiddled with the flowers, creating a makeshift bouquet.  He was ready.

Bounding up the stairs, he entered a long room full of minimalist and yet warm decor - dark wood tables, stylishly industrial ceiling, gently flickering candles.  A jazz trio trilled quietly in one corner as servers clad in crisp white shirts buzzed between tables, offering up tasteful wine suggestions while deftly delivering exquisitely prepared and presented dishes.

An involuntary intake of breath; there she was - a vision in red, jet black hair, and wide dark eyes, sitting at a table dead centre in the restaurant.  Centre court.  A server was delivering a bottle of wine - which she tasted expertly and approved.  The server melted away.

As he approached, she turned her head ever so slightly to acknowledge his presence but continued to take in the activity around her.

\"You're late\", she said, not looking at him.

\"I'd planned on getting here earlier - I had to make a couple of stops...\" he replied quietly.

\"It's fine actually - I feel like I'm in some sort of upscale romantic movie...I didn't know places like this existed in Toronto.  It doesn't seem quite seem real.  Oh, I took the liberty of ordering us some wine.\"

He sat and peered at the label.  \"How much is this stuff?\"

\"Oh I don't know,\" she replied, \"we're celebrating aren't we?  This is the place for it.\"

\"I suppose that's true, love.  These flowers are for you.\"

She glanced down at the proffered bouquet - and made a choking sound.  For around the stems, binding them tightly together, was a delicate, beautiful ring, blazing with diamonds.  Her eyes went wide, tears forming in the corners.  She looked up.

\"Babe is this...\"

He was already on one knee:  \"Honey, I've been waiting a long time to say these words...will you marry me?\"

...And the camera pulls back, down the aisle, past the jazz trio, through the inlaid-brick courtyard and back to the planter affixed to the wrought iron gates.  In the planter, two remaining flowers lilt gently together in the warm glow of evening in the city."}
{"text":"5 stars for brunch! It's hard to find delicious food at a reasonable price when it comes to brunch but Brassaii is just that! Most brunch places I've visited are in run down, grimey, cramped spaces that look like they barely pass for health code but Brassaii is a nice, clean and spacious restaurant! For all you tea snobs, they have some pretty good loose leaf tea. Service is friendly, eggs benedict with smoked salmon is pretty delicious... The price is right! No complaints at all! I'm glad I found this place and will definitely be back for brunch again."}
{"text":"We love Brassai, especially on Wednesdays.  Their main owner Andrew treats absolutely everyone with respect and like a superstar, very atypical of club owners who think they're celebrities.  Food is awesome, we like the chicken dish, the steak dish and pasta.  Their creme Brulee is the best in the city.  They also make every specialty drink ie Moscow mule, sangria, old fashioned perfect!  Their brunch party last Sunday of each month is also super fun and good, cheaper bottles too.  Nice space, nice patio, all in all dope supperclub party spot with a good owner."}
{"text":"I've been here 4x now and last night, my friends and I went here for a bachelorette's. We were a party of 15 people in total. We went for dinner and dancing in the same place. What I enjoyed was the food, it was a set menu so I had salad, steak and creme brulee for a total of 55$. My food was good and steak was done to perfection. However, some of my friends didn't end up getting their desserts and what I didn't like the most was the fact that a few of my friends showed up later and just wanted to drink with the bride to be and was declined service unless they ordered dinner as well. Very stupid idea in my opinion. They need to fix that policy and need to have better service for a large party considering we're paying for the food and 18% tip (automatically added to the bill). They charge a 10$ fee for cutting serive (of a cake). I like that they have 2 dance floors and they play similar music: r&b + hip hop"}
{"text":"Ok so last time I came here it was for breakfast.

Now that I work in the area I find this place slowly climbing higher and higher on my list. The service is greatly improved and the staff is very friendly. At lunch time it's filled with typical ad agency folk. 

There's a lot to like. Beers are priced decently, they make vesper martinis, and have the best burger in the city hands down.

I usually do a big Vesper martini ($16 for 3oz), which is decently priced since it's like buying 3 drinks, and a prime rib burger. The prime rib burger is the best burger I've had in this city. The meat is flavourful without feeling greasy and it is very well balanced. It has the right amount of bun to meat to toppings ratio. It's actually perfect.

Mind you, this burger is $14 but I say totally worth it for the best burger in the city and it is not even close to the $20-something burger you'd find at the Queen and Beaver. 

Come here for the burger at lunch and a vesper. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"If there was an option to put 0/5 this would have it.

My second (and certainly my last) visit to Brassaii. I shall now pin-point all of the negative things that happened during my visit, as there is not enough room to talk about them all...

- waiter was no where to be found when needed
- drinks took more than 10 minutes to arrive
- appetizers arrived the same time as dinner (over 45 minutes)
- one guest had their salad sitting on the table for 30 minutes, while he specifically asked for the salad to arrive when everyone had their meals
- waiter cleared birthday girl's plate before she was finished, never showing any sign of remorse
- other table had been seated for nearly 1 hour before getting the waiter's attention
- when they asked the waiter why they weren't getting any service he had the nerve to blame their lateness for his lack of service
- explained the problem to the the manager who took the waiter's side
- the owner stormed up to the table yelling, asking why after an hour an a half after our reservation time, they didn't have anything on the table except water. the situation was explained, but he again, pointed the blame back at us
- once we asked for a new waiter the owner huffed and puffed about how frustrating it would be to get another server from a different side of the restaurant to look over us
waiter refused to give us the name of the owner and his name

Working as a server in the past, I know what it's like. #1 rule is to keep your guests happy. This was the first time where I witnessed the server to point the blame at a guest for lack of service. I understand the restaurant is busy, but there were a million other ways he could of taken to solve the problem, which inevitably never got solved.

All twenty of us got up and left as we realized what a fucking waste of time this was."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out brassaii for a while now, but living in the West end makes it difficult sometimes. I was excited when my friend decided to do her birthday there. It is a beautiful space with a nice set up that can be easily manipulated to suit all kinds of events.  For brunch they had a fixed priced menu that started with a fruit platter, choice of omelette, steak and eggs or banana French toast and ended with pastries. As tempting as the banana French toast sounded I went for the steak and eggs because its more bang for your buck.  The majority of the party agreed.  

Before I complain I just want to say the food was good and the server was pleasant.  However, the service was definitely a miss that day. There was an overall consensus that the portions were a bit on the smaller size until we realized our steak and eggs described as ( grilled 6oz steak+fries+wilted spinach+ veal jus+ wild mushrooms and squash puree) came with no fries or mushrooms. When we asked why the server replied good question and said they will cook some up and bring them out which unfortunately came out after most of us finished or meal.  There were more than a couple steaks not made as requested (over/undercooked). One guest asked for well done and they attempted twice but after the second time receiving a medium steak she opted not to eat because we were all done.  The pan perdu banana bread French toast was good but too small and tasted like warm banana bread. I don't believe it was dipped in an egg mixture and fried. 

Overall I'm not a picky eater and I was fine with my food and how it was prepared. I found the portions small and ordered a second meal (French toast) and I was content.  My friend did as well. She started with the French toast and ordered the steak after and they brought it again without fries or mushrooms which at that point seemed comical because they expected her to take from the mushrooms and fries served earlier to the table.  In the end the manager apologized and comped our meal and sent us a round of drinks. I really appreciate him acknowledging that they dropped the ball. I will be back to update this review because I believe it was a one off."}
{"text":"Emailed Rhonda at the concierge desk to make a reservation for a group of 13 girls for a triple birthday on Saturday night. She was a delight to deal with and answered all my questions and was very helpful. We had dinner reservations at 9:30pm. We weren't seat until about 10:15pm but we were having drinks at the bar so no one really minded. The hostesses were both very sweet and kind. We had balloons so they held them at the front and brought them to our table when we were ready to be seated. They even complimented us on how kind our group of girls are.
We had dinner and the food came out fast and orderly. The only thing they forgot one side of mushrooms but it was totally fine because we were stuffed with the rest of the food orders. I really appreciated how the restaurant did not make us spend a minimum amount on food or set menus. A few of us are vegetarians so that worked out well. There were lots of choices on the menu and the drinks were good too. 
We stayed and partied the night away which was a blast.
Def recommend this place for a group party or a fun night :)"}
{"text":"We were on the Summerlicious menu. The dishes wree very well presented & great portion size. I just found them a little bland in taste.  The service was ok."}
{"text":"Food:
Tenderloin: 4 stars
Octopus: 5 stars

The tenderloin was succulent but I would say that you should try Ruth Chris or Peter's Fine Dining if steak is your main motive. I actually enjoyed all the little side bits and pieces that came with the tenderloin. The red beet and butternut squash puree tasted very fresh and smooth. Crispy brussels sprout leaves were like kale chips and it was interestingly good. 
The octopus was firm but still tender. The crispy speck and baby arugula went well with the 'nduja sausage and yellow pepper puree. The 'nduja sausage was more like minced smoked spicy meat. Worth a try!
The guys sitting next to us recommended this tapas special they were having. For $20, you get 3 signature tapas along with a drink. They said the tapas were REALLY good. We decided to skip on it but keep an eye out for it when you're there.

Ambiance: 4 stars
The entrance is all the way in from a little alley between two other restaurants but they have signs so just keep an eye out for them. We were actually just strolling along King St and didn't plan on having dinner there so we didn't make any reservations. Their dining area was full even at 9pm so we sat at the bar since the lounge tables for 2 didn't look all that comfortable. The tables looked like they would be to low to eat a proper meal off of. I'm not a fan of restaurants where they dim the lights for atmospheric purposes so that didn't quite appeal to me. The place was very classy overall though; a nice place for a fancy date.

Service: 4 stars
Our waitress was also the bartender and she was very friendly. She was all smiles all night and checked up on us periodically to see if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Came here for  lunch and was slightly disappointed. 

The good:
The ambiance and decor was great...i really enjoyed the atmosphere.
Their capuccino

The not so good:
Service was extremely slow despite not having that many customers when we arrived
The spaghettini with white wine, garlic sauce, and clams was fishy ($14) and not very flavourful. very disappointing. However, there were an abundance of clams.

I woudl give it another chance for dinner and hopefully it would live up to all the other yelp reviews this place continues to receive."}
{"text":"I'm giving Brassai my first 5 star rating .... it is a great spot on King West that you can go to for a great lunch or dinner and a professional, stylin crowd ... and i actually like the menu too!  or they've just launched as a lounge and Wed. nights are it!  I like the style of the place with DJs beats, but not so loud its overwhelming, and a hip/cool/stylish and friendly crowd.  A great spot to go with just a couple ppl or a larger group."}
{"text":"The ambience and service is okay.  I ordered a drink and foie gras.  A nice twist was the use of wine vinegar in the cocktail, giving it a tart and exotic taste.  Some of the brioche accompanying the foie gras came out burnt, but they replaced it, though not fast enough.  Interesting place and I might give it another shot, but at their prices I couldn't be a regular even if I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"I know there are a lot of mixed reviews on Brassaii, but my experience was top notch.  The service was great, I loved the menu and I had a dessert sampler which was fabulous.

I can see how this place can be a bit pretentious (and has a lounge vibe) but if you can get past that and focus on just the quality of the food, you'll definitely enjoy yourself.  Standout dishes for me included the panko fried ribs and the halibut."}
{"text":"I come here for drinks more than I would like to admit and mostly because of the location. It's just so conveniently located and I happen to always end up here. There were a few times where I came by with friends and it was not nearly busy enough which I don't like so we would leave right away in search of a more fun bar. 

The space is nice. I like the patio outside - casual enough so its a nice place to just chill with some friends after work. We've held private functions here before and the service and events staff are helpful and professional. Drinks and food are decent but I definitely don't come here for the food. I guess I come more because its convenient and familiar and generally service is predictable. 

I know this place turns into a club at night but I've never been so I can't speak to that. My friends always seem to want to go to the same couple clubs and this place was just never one of them. Overall this place is okay, I have no complaints when people want to chill here but I wouldn't go out of my way to choose it."}
{"text":"Brassaii amd Lee(by Susur)still maintains the top of places of my fine dinning experience downtown Toronto. Its a great place to go without paying top dollars. Their duck confit was amazing. Nice open space with contemporary atmosphere. Huge front patio in summer, and there is another bar outdoor with heaters standing. I love the food, only it was one dish but beats tons other mini-yogurt. A restaurant can have one dish that stand out is good enough. Me and my friend who went ordering the same dish both agree that it was one of the best dishes all time(only if you like duck) 

Their desert orange vanilla creme brulee was sooo delicious. Best way to finish a great dinner =)"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Came here for drinks w/a friend for the long weekend. I ordered the Lola (lavender drink) was really refreshing and the Creamsicle tasted like, well, a creamsicle. My friend ordered a cocktail w/bourbon, balsamic vinegar and mint, he seemed to like it but didn't rave about it. The cocktails here are good but the service is so.slow."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! The food is pretty good fare, as are the drinks. The ambiance and decor are quite classy. While this place is quite busy, the service standard is superb. The drawback was the tea selection (they did not have Darjeeling or even simple black tea). But if you're not an avid tea drinker, try this place out!"}
{"text":"I came here with 3 friends for dinner about a month ago, and I still think it was one of the best dining experiences/nights out I've had in a while. Most people think of Brassaii as just a place to party, but the food here should definitely not be overlooked!

The food:
All of the food was so good and totally worth the money. We shared a charcuterie board to start, and while I cannot remember each individual item on it, as a whole we were all very satisfied. The meats were all pretty good and flavoured, none of them were too dry or anything, the cheeses were good, and they had a fruit chutney that I really enjoyed.

We each ordered a different dish, and every single one was delicious. I ordered scallops which came with fig jam, dill vinaigrette, monteiro cheese, rosemary poached pear and squid chips. Of course I enjoyed it, as I always do with scallops, and I love figs as well, so in general everything about this dish just worked for me.

Venison loin - perfectly cooked, not overdone, soft, juicy, tender. I thought the venison here was better than the one we had at Canoe.

Tenderloin - again, the meat here was cooked perfectly, and the dish was made interesting with the addition of a poached egg on top.

Lobster tail (house-cured and bacon-wrapped tail) - I don't think I even tried the lobster, but this dish came with the most amazing sweet corn risotto. Never in my life have I had cravings for risotto until after I had this. There was something about the texture of this risotto that was unique, like the grains were slightly harder, almost like they toasted them or something? But so so so good, and the flavours were perfect.

We were all so pleased with our food that when it was time for dessert we couldn't resist trying a few and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake and pot de creme. I think both were good, but they couldn't quite compare to the fantastic food.

Ambience: 
Part of what made this dining experience so great was the staff and just the overall vibe of this place. It's super trendy, and after a certain hour the bar area kind of turns into a club/dance floor thing. Super fun on a Friday night. Our waiter was absolutely hilarious and so charming, and there were just so many little fun surprises throughout the night - glasses of free prosecco, a complimentary candy bar in the front (granted, it was the day before Valentine's day, but it was such a fun touch!), and a polaroid which came with my drink (called the Attention Whore, and it was delicious). Gotta love a place that just knows how to show its guests a fun time!!

We didn't really stay out that late, so I can't really comment on the club aspect, although it seems like it would be fun. Absolutely recommend this restaurant for their food though, and the overall experience!"}
{"text":"Went to Brassaii on a Wed night last week. It gets packed around 11:30pm. The patio is great in the summer, but there's also a dance-floor and nice bar area inside. Lots of good-looking women here. One of the better places to go mid-week in Toronto."}
{"text":"OK so this is a place where you go to people-watch. Everyone is good looking and the place is fancy and cool. The food however is just alright - nothing to write home about.

In my opinion the the plates are overpriced for what you're getting (especially the apps).

Appetizer:
4 small scallops: $21. Excellent presentation but nothing special.

Main course:
We tried the short rib and the venison chop ($35/ea). The meat on both was excellent but the choice of accompaniment was disappointing (some steamed vegetables) - no imagination.

Dessert:
Creme Brulee. $10. Excellent.

The service was excellent!!

In brief, a place where you go not so much for the food but more to see what's \"happening\" in town."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?!

Their brunch!

If you're looking for a brunch place AND can take reservation, this is not a bad restaurant to check out. The menu is very simple and offers some good options for brunch/lunch. If you have a big party or if you have kids, this is also a good restaurant to consider. Especially when you want more space, this venue can offer you a lot of space for your party. 

A good selection of brunch items that can considered if you like waffles. They have chicken and waffle or braised pork and waffles. They also have sandwiches and burgers if you are feeling a heavier meal. 

I ordered the big breakfast. Their big breakfast comes with sausage, roasted potatoes, 3 eggs (any style), some roasts and salad. It's a decent meal for $15. I came out satisfied with their brunch but I wouldn't go here if you're looking for something unique for brunch. It's just a good gathering place for your friends and family for lunch/brunch though!

LAST TIP??

If you check in with yelp, you'll get a free prosecco offer. Kind of early for a champagne but hey, it's free!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"service is slow here, which is not what you would expect in such a beautiful place serving such pricy food (e.g. Scallop appetizer was $21 and it has one scallop on the plate. wasn't worth it either). had a few of their drinks and they were decent, about $14 each. Their charcutterie board ($30) enjoyable for sharing. the service was just slow, and inattentive. Unacceptable since we were literally the only people there at about 1030 on a monday and our bill was almost $200."}
{"text":"not good. would not recommend. food was over priced and bland. If you are on King West, there are so much other better options available."}
{"text":"Brassaii has been a restaurant in th Toronto area for quite some time now. They have gone through a number of chef changes and undergone a few renos. The latest reno has brought brassaii to a very chic and modern look and feel. In fact almost everything is black or has some variety of dark colours to its decor. It's very loungy which has its fair amount of young professionals and socialites hanging around.  So as a place to lounge and have a drink, brassaii could be an option.

My friend and I decided to start off our meal with some simple white wine. I got the 2009 chardonnay brassaii select and my friend got the 2006 riesling/icewine which was actually quite nice. I preferred hers.  So while we caught up, brassaii serves you your typical table bread with some olive oil to dip in. We ended up deciding to go with the lobster bites as apps to share. She decided on the panko crusted chicken breast filled with prosciutto and brie with some seasoned vegs.  I decided to go with the kobe beef meatball spaghetti. The wait wasn't horrible at all at about 10 mins or so between our wine, app and mains. So something was always coming and coming at a very good even preferable pace.

The lobster app was pretty nice. It's deep fried with a very nice side sauce that's drizzled on. We liked it soo much we just had to dip it in more sauce as we continued eating. My friend really enjoyed her panko crusted chicken. It had a nice and simple flavour. You can actually taste the brie and the chicken was tender and moist on the inside.  It was done well. The dish stood out for my friend. My kobe beef mixed meatball spaghetti was also served in a nice and simple flavour.  The spaghetti was cooked a little bit better than average and the tomato sauce was good. I think the biggest seller was the meatball and those weren't bad at all. Now I strongly don't believe it's all kobe (not for $19), so I assume it's a very very small portion that was used in making the meatballs. To me that's fine, I kinda think of it as a kobe inspired type of meatball anyways.

Overall, brassaii was alright. But I have to say right away that their menu does change often and can follow seasonal offerings.  For this occasion it wasn't bad, but on an average I don't believe brassaii may be worth it for its price. Nothing was horrible and the service was attentive, but I just don't feel typically outside of this experience, its worth it. Yess if all your friends are young professionals and enjoy the lounging part, then it's not bad. The decor is contemporary and modern, so for that I have to say it's not a bad choice. As a dinner choice however, I have to say it's slightly above average but what are your thoughts, how's brassaii to you?"}
{"text":"First time visiting here for a friends birthday, which was booked much in advance. The atmosphere is nice if you want to have dinner and dance afterwards but that's about as positive as it gets. Expect to wait over an hour for the food to finally come out and not expect an apology from management. Then once you receive your meal expect ridiculously small portions for the price your paying and mediocre taste.  The waitstaff are no better. Trying to find a server is like trying to find Waldo and asking about their menu is just pointless. I am lactose intolerant and asked the blonde waitress if there was any cheese on the fries   As it was not clearly stated she then very confidently informs me there is no cheese but no surprise once the fries arrived there was a huge mountain of cheese spread all around. Now having to wait for the meal to be remade was just icing to the cake. It only took another 20minutes for simple fires to finally make its way out. Overall never returning and would not recommend this place unless you have no problem wasting your night waiting hours for food to come out.  There are far better places on king street that appreciate your business."}
{"text":"I came here twice, both for corporate events. Once I was just a guest and the other time I helped plan it.

It's beautiful inside and the service is responsive, when you plan an event here.

Both time I was stunned by how good the food was - usually at large events, I assume that the food's only going to be so-so at best (and a few degrees off from their usual quality) because cooking for huge crowds is difficult when it comes to quality control.

Both times the food turned out amazingly. The scallop hors d'oeuvres are my favourite!

I ordered some kind of braised beef dish for the sit-down dinner and it melted in my mouth. Absolutely heavenly. 

The service is also reliably good.

A hip joint with good food - I'd be happy to come back on my own for a meal! They also have dancing after dinner on the weekends, I believe."}
{"text":"I never knew that they serve dinner here. Had the best dinner. Best service ever my PJ. If you're going to go out for drinks on King St., West in Toronto, why would you ever go anywhere else?"}
{"text":"Great ambiance but the food and service weren't as notable. I came here for dinner and enjoyed the meal but there was nothing (food wise) that would bring me back for more. Started with the lobster salad that lacked flavor and originality. Presentation was consistently great but the food wasn't nearly as appetizing as it looked. Our mains were the tagliolini and tenderloin. The tagliolini was good but nothing special, same with the tenderloin (failed to execute a medium steak, clearly more on the well done side). Our waiter wasn't sympathetic to the disappointment and didn't try to improve our overall level of satisfaction (the steak in particular was disappointing). Not a bad experience but definitely not eager to return."}
{"text":"I recently organized a bachelorette and arranged bottle service at Brassaii for a group of 8 of us.  I emailed with Nelson to book everything and his email stated: 
\"I have a table reserved right now for the group. 2 bottle minimum. Grey Goose $340 all in that includes tax and gratuity.\"
We had a great night, but when I got the bill, it was $605.  Our server was not able to do anything about what I assumed was a price error, so I paid it with the intention of contacting Nelson and assumed he would fix the error.   I was mistaken.  Apparently that \"$340 all in\" was for 1 bottle, not the 2 I thought I was quoted.  Now silly me for assuming that when someone states \"all in\" that means that is the total amount.  The point is, Nelson should not assume that everyone has regular bottle service and know that $40 bottles at the LCBO cost $340 each at Brassaii.   And the bottom line was he did not recognize his error or own up to the fact that he did not quote the proper price.   His quote was misleading and shady, and I will not give my money to dishonest people."}
{"text":"Love Love Love Love Love Brassaii!

I wish it would pack up shop and move to NYC so I could go more often!  This place would get 10 stars if I could give it to them!   I randomly found them online when I was searching for a place to go to lunch with a friend on my last visit to the T-dot and thought I'd give it a shot.  it's nestled pretty far back from the street, so I walked by it a few times before finding it, so make sure you look for the courtyard behind a big wrought iron gate.  Set back from the street, there are a few dining tables and a bar outside, mostly used at night to my understanding.

Once inside, the space is GORGEOUS.  Breathtaking floor to ceiling windows (almost!) bathe the place in natural light, while a banquette stretches down the left hand side of the wall, opposite the open air kitchen.  The decor is spot on - the interior designer deserves a commendation!  If I ever had to do an event in TO, Brassaii would be a top pick - GREAT space.... event planners, take note!

So my friend and I arrived for lunch (I was surprised it wasn't busier, but they may have opened recently - this was August 2007) and were seated and got our menus.  I guess it's not as customary in TO as it is in NYC to order a bottle of wine for 2 people at an extended lunch (clearly not going back to work!), so my friend was a tad shocked, but he soon got into the swing of things!  They had a vast selection of delicious sandwiches (I forget which one I had, but will update this review when I go back!), and I remember their desserts being absolutely scrumptious (I think the bakery is on site?).  Check out their menu on their website...  Lunchtime entrees are about $12-$15 each, plus whatever else you get, so this isn't a daily stop, but great for reunions with old friends, or perfect for a business luncheon.  

I loved my meal so much that at night I met up with a group of friends who I hadn't seen in a while and we were trying to decide where to eat and I was raving about lunch, and it turns out none of them had ever been to Brassaii!  So I called them, got a reservation and we were back!  Once again, another stupendous meal.   Dinner entrees were more in the $20-25 range plus everything else (I think we had 4-5 bottles of vino... yikes!).

Definitely a great experience I think just about everyone would enjoy - very eclectic,bistro-ish menu (their website says it's reminiscent of a New York Diner, but I don't really draw that parallel...).  Perfect for lunch, dinner, drinks, etc etc.  CHECK IT OUT!  Highly recommended ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Brassaii on several occasions, but was never involved in a dinner-time excursion.  My friend had her bachelorette there on a Saturday night, which was to include dinner and then dancing - and I arrived at 10pm expecting them to be in the process of eating (their dinner resos were at 9pm).  Their food didn't arrive until around 10:30, which seemed kind of crazy to me.  It was also very hot in the restaurant area, not sure if it was the room temperature or just the hot-air from screaming girls all around me.  That aside, they were accommodating to my friend and I, who arrived late and asked for two extra chairs in the already crowded restaurant.

I asked all the girls how their food was, and their reviews ranged from \"decent\" to \"my chicken is cold\" (two girls).  Cold chicken is pretty hideous.  This place is mad expensive, yo!  All I got was two glasses of wine and a cheesecake (which was good but looked like a boob with a nipple on top), so I was satisfied on my end.

The issue I had with the night, was that my friend (the bride) asked about 5 times when her booth would be ready.  The server kept skirting the question, saying she was trying to figure out our bills.   She was pretty nice, but seemed to get really impatient when asked about the booth.  That said, it took them a bit long to bring the bills and have us pay, that by the time we got to our booth - we were unpleasantly surprised....the 'booth' was one section of couch and that's it.  I've had bottle service at Brassaii on more than one occasion, and the booths have always at minimum had three sections of cushy couch to sit on:

Normally shaped like this:


|_|  


We had this:

_


I have a feeling they overbooked the booths, and then since the dinner took so long to conclude that they just threw together a 'booth' for us.  One side of our 'booth' were the backs of three chairs, that were thrown into the booth next to us.  We asked the manager what was up with this garbage arrangement, and his response was \"this is the booth you get for two bottles\".

LIAR

Unless that's a new policy that started that night, this dude was full of it.  He walked away looking smug with his made-up excuse.

That crap aside, the place is fun to dance in when it doesn't get overcrowded like it often does.  The clientele ranges from people who think they own King street, to a peroxide blonde girl who decided to shove me when I accidentally stepped on her toe.  

I like the music, because I am easily pleased and like top 40 garbage when it comes to sloppily dancing and showcasing my best white-girl moves (meaning I can't dance).  If you want weird club-beats then don't go to Brassaii."}
{"text":"A Friday night surprise party had to be moved to Brassaii after the original venue was WAY too packed. We arrived around 8 and were seated by a super friendly hostess in one of the front booths. We were just in time to see all of the beautiful people of Toronto file in. Seriously, I've never seen so many perfect curls file by in one place before. 

None of us were particularly hungry, so we ordered the Olives & Peppers and an order of fries. Both were super tasty, particularly the bread and the peppers! I love it when food is ACTUALLY spicy.

Our waitress was very nice and super accommodating for our large group that all arrived at different times. Because we were at a booth reserved for bottle service, we had to leave our table by 10, but the staff wasn't pushy about making us leave when we were still finishing our drinks at 10 past."}
{"text":"So we are talking about a pro-league here. Maybe an entry level, but definitely not a wannabe.

Yes, that means that you'd better come in booking in advance and dressed up - it's no fun to look like a piece of lowlife in front of all that oh-so-serious servers.

Now, when a restaurant requires me to work on myself before visiting it, it should rather be prepared to meet my expectations, too.

And I can tell that Brassaii was up to what it wanted to look like.

- Excellent service. Pro-level, no mistakes here - 5/5;
- Example quality of food. Again, pro-level - 5/5;
- Order arrived on the table fast, but a tad bit later that I may have expected, hence 4/5;
- Portion size is a demo of what you could have been eating, 1/5;
- Menu is shortish, 3/5 - though drinks menu is 4/5;
- Design and quality of the interior, 2/5;
- Noise level, 2/5.

As for the portion size... I know it is a trend, and everyone else is doing the same, but still - it hurts me to get a \"try me\" sample of food, paying for a full-sized plate. Those samples look great zoomed on the food magazine front page, but not in the stomach.

Overall, not quite solid four stars for a decent restaurant. Not without its shortcomings, but absolutely ok to return or invite people who eat out frequently and can appreciate the good place. Just don't come in hungry, unless you wish to treat a main plate as a starter to really eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Toronto's Official Douche Vortex.

If there is any place in Toronto where all of the 905, douche players come to show off their slick hair cuts, bad attitudes and enjoy an atmosphere akin to a gino dance from the 80's - this is the place.  

We came there to eat with a party of 8 and this is where it started going off the rails immediately.  Having experienced doing the large party thing before, I always like to clarify that I would like to be on a separate bill with whoever I'm with to avoid the inevitable gong show at the end of the night as to who owes what.  If you've ever had this experience before, you'll understand what I'm talking about.  Someone always ends up not paying what they owe, ducking out early and leaving the bulk of the bill with the last man standing at the table.  Seems like a simple enough request to me - but not here.  

What I was told after requesting this, was that \"our policy is that with parties of 8 or more we put everything on one bill - but don't worry, we keep track of everyone by seat number...\"??  Let me just repeat that, they \"put everything on one bill - yet not to worry, they keep track of each person according to their seat number.\" So....what is the problem with doing separate bills...if...they are keeping track of the individuals?  This made no sense to me and caused a whole \"thing\" at the end of the night. Our waitress was \"ok\" during the night but at the end a funny thing happened.  Its like when it came to bill time, probably knowing that this kind of argument happens, they sent in a \"heavy\" to do the bill collecting from us - and he was a fucking asshole to say the least.  I felt like we were being shaken down.  What a joke.  This leaves the party to sort through a ridiculously long bill doing all kinds of math in dim lighting and probably slightly buzzed.  

I was pretty pissed but it wasn't just because of this - the food was totally lame and way over priced.  I had the pasta - bland, flavourless.  My GF had the chicken - also pretty bland with a high price tag.  

This is what made the whole experience even worse.  If the food was killer, they would have got a pass on the whole bill fiasco but it wasn't which made that part all the more hard to swallow. 

In the end, after abruptly asking if \"i wanted to speak with the manager\" (over such a simple request again of asking for a separate bill...that they KEEP TRACK OF ANYWAY)- she ended up giving use the separate bill without issue.  The only issue is that they left a customer walking out of the place feeling unsatisfied, a sense of not being welcome and knowing that he'd never go to that place again.

Oh, and to throw it back to the \"douchbag\" thing, if you do happen to go to this place, be sure to sit outside if you can instead of in the dining area. At a later point in the evening, they curtain off the front of the place from the back dining area and to leave, you have to wade through a sea of these douchy people lounging, dancing, drinking being rude and all that good stuff you find at a lame ass club.

Trust me, if you want to eat good food, don't go here - its over priced crap."}
{"text":"I went to Brassaii this past Saturday for a friend's bday dinner. The service was good. The friendly and attentive staff were quick to get us our drinks and take our orders. 

The food was good or average depending on what you ordered. I ordered the Pappardelle Vongole and my husband ordered the Braised Lamb Shank. The Pappardelle was very nice and flavourful. I've had this dish in Italy before and I wouldn't go as far as to say it was any close to being as good as that, but for a place that turns into a club afterwards, this dish wasn't half bad. The Lamb Shank was unimpressive. Light on the taste and not a lot of accompaniments served with the Shank. It came with only two tiny pieces of polenta and that's about it. My other friend had the octopus salad and even though he said it was good, it was a very small portioned dish so if you want a more substantial meal, do not order this one. We also ordered the ice cream sandwiches. Not good at all. The cookies were bland and almost stale tasting and the ice cream inside was nothing special. 

After dinner we moved into the dance area. When it comes to the clubbing portion of this review, Brassaii is definitely a good time. Good music, nice patios and it wasn't super packed or crammed which I liked."}
{"text":"In a frantic last minute search to land a dinner reservation for Valentine's Day we were lucky enough to secure a 6:00pm reservation at Brassaii.

We arrived 15 minutes late but called ahead as a we were stuck in traffic. Parking was a cinch to find as street parking is available starting at 6pm so were able to score a spot right out front. 

We walked down the romantic cobblestone courtyard up to there signature red doors. We were welcomed by a pair of hostesses holding the door open followed by complimentary coat check. Another hostess offered us complimentary glasses of sparkling wine before leading us to our table.

Since it was Valentine's Day they had a complimentary candy station and picture booth. We of course took part in the picture booth, dressing up with props and received the free photos at the end of our dinner. I thought that was a great idea, we had tons of fun doing that.

We were seated a cozy table in the corner dressed fittingly with red table cloths and napkins and candlelight. Our waiter was really friendly and attentive the whole evening. After taking our orders he brought a basket of warm sliced bread and butter.

For Drinks we went with two glasses of champagne - Moet et Chandon which is always delicious and bubbly.

For starters we went with the house soup
Butternut squash + pumpkin seed brittle + apple + parsnip
The soup came in a huge bowl, very creamy and flavourful without being too heavy, and I loved the added crunch from the brittle

For mains we both went with the striploin
16 oz Striploin - grilled + mushroom sauce + shallot + choice of one side
The steak came beautifully plated in thick juicy slices. it was a humongous portion looked far more larger 16 oz, more than enough for one person. The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, nice tender cut and very flavourful. I also loved the sweet grilled shallots adorning the steak. 

For my side I went with the Brussels Sprouts + Pancetta
Again another huge platter which was fitting for two people. The sprouts were lightly caramelized with bits of the diced pancetta giving it a nice porky flavour

We also go also a side of the House Cut Fries + Parmigiano Reggiano + Aioli
Again another huge portion. The fries were ok - very golden brown with a sprinkling of  grated cheese over top, nothing more to it

As if we weren't overly stuffed at this point I could not resist having a look at the dessert menu

Pot Au Creme - Baileys Alunga Milk Chocolate + Dulcey Orange Tart + Coffee Sauce
The pot au creme had that distinct bailey's flavour however I would have liked it to be slightly more chocolatey. The orange tart with coffee sauce was the clear winner on the plate - I was really hesitant that I would not like it all - coffee & orange? - however the flavours really complimented each other, the bright citrus flavour from the creamy tart and the sweet coffee sauce really worked well together.

Overall I have to say Brassaii really did a great job in creating a romantic and memorable Valentine's Day.  Food portions were very generous, staff were all very friendly and service was great from start to finish."}
{"text":"This review is for the restaurant, not the bar/lounge scene.

I was somewhat concerned by the fact that this was a 1,000 point booking on OpenTable for a Friday night.  And sure enough, when we arrived at 8:00 for our reservation, there was only one other table seated.  By the time we left, 3 others had been seated.  They do seat the tables close together, so you don't feel like you're in an empty room, and it might be different in the summer, but do be aware.  

Now that's out of the way, the food and the drinks were fantastic.  They have a grilled corn risotto that is precisely the way I like it - savory, lots of cheese, not over-salted and without the cream that I HATE seeing in risotto.  The grilled corn kernels kind of replace the toasted pine nuts you'd find elsewhere, and were a nice touch.  

if you like your sangria dark, you'll find it here.  And for me, huge bonus points for serving a sazerac with Wiser's 18-year that didn't cost me a fortune.  After 4 nights in a city that shamelessly charges $20+ for hamburgers, these drinks were probably the best value I found.  

Server was very funny and perfectly attentive.  Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"On a short trip to Toronto, were lucky to stumble upon this awesome trendy modern spot in a swanky part of town; beautiful interior design and even better service and presentation. 

Food is amazing and service is fantastic. We had the pleasure of meeting Owen who helps run the place, top notch guy who greeted our table, made great recommendations, conversation and made sure we got what we needed.

I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews... People leaving low scoring reviews are either not getting laid or are blind to good taste.  Either way, Brassai is one of the better restaurants  I've seen in Toronto and on its way to the top.  Keep up the great work Brassai.

(Note that Yelp is not very popular in Toronto or east Canada, and reviews are often only put up when customers are not happy. Balance it out by looking at pictures and give these hidden gems a chance.  Also check out trip advisor for additional guidance.)"}
