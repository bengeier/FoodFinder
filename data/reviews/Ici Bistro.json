{"text":"I want to go back and give my other five star reviews four stars or have the option to give this place six. It was spectacular from start to finish.  Excellent service, friendly and relaxed and the food is first class.  The steak tartare trio was a standout as was the scallop, crab and drunken lobster dish.  Just wish I could afford to go more!"}
{"text":"Met up with close friends tonight at ICI Bistro in Toronto to celebrate our return to the City, and.... BAM!  One of the best meals I have ever had anywhere!! Flavors were delicate, complex, layered, and just so very intense and delicious. We had oysters, charcuterie, croquettes, many lamb variations, outstanding lobster bisque, scallops, sausage and cheese, and two kinds of suffle.... Food porn at it's very best. If you live in Toronto, make your reservation now and find out what world's best tastes like."}
{"text":"Let me start by agreeing with everyone about the atmosphere and service! Surprising in a few ways..fine dining in a very residential neighbourhood, staff that were not at all stuffy and quite knowledgeable and tables spaced out enough to work equally well for dates, or get togethers with old/dear friends.   The charcuterie platter was incredible with foie gras that made us save a piece so that it was the last bite we had of that dish. The pork belly was pretty incredible too. The proscuitto was a little on the dry side but everything else was so good we didn't care.   The market fish was good and served with polenta. Not incredible, but good.   The braised beef was very tasty but the best part of that dish was whatever pureed goodness they served the mushrooms and artichokes on top of. That made me want to revert to my nonna's kitchen, grab some bread and mop up every last drop.   While we were very tempted by the souffle, we are cheese lovers and the french cheese platter was calling to us. We were not disappointed by our choice. Generous portions with a good variety and all quite wonderful.   Portion sizes are offered..we chose small for the appetizer and large for the entrees. That worked for us. That said, I think we both agreed that we might just go for the large charcuterie platter and cheese next time because they were our favourite parts of the meal..and some pretty amazing Stratus wine too!  Parking is tough so leave enough time to find parking in the neighbourhood if you are driving.   All in all, we will go back!"}
{"text":"I am a FAN of their soufflé, soufflé. Fluffy, tasty, just perfect 5/5  Drinks:  2 glass of their specialty,  not bad - 3/5  We order their signature steak tar tar - it was perfect with the special lightly deep fried potato harsh - love the potato harsh!!!  5/5  Squid - 5/5 - avocado beignet - very yummy, squid was perfectly cooked  foie gras - 3/5  - they served it in pâté form...I prefer it to be seared.    Lamb - 3/5 - love the gamey taste - but extremely memorable  Beef - 3/5 - brisket style, blend not enough flavor, tenderness is ok  Our total bill with tax:  $170 ish before tips & Tax  I want to go back everyday for the soufflé!  lol   Score on Food:  71%  Score on Service:  100%   - all waitresses that night were so friendly, and they all seems to enjoy their work and proud to be working there, I love that!    Score on Atmosphere:  90% - We were seated at the HEAD TABLE  (over seeing the kitchen - my hubby love it, he was narrating for me the whole night on what the chef was making - since I was too short to see it all in action)  Total Score:  87%   Tips:  Party of 4 max - party of 2 is best!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with a couple of friends.  We all agreed that it was just ok at best.  First off, the maple cocktail the waitress recommended was waaay to sweet.  It took me all night to finish because I kept having to add ice water to it to tone it down.  And the cocktails were quite pricey to say the least.  As for the food, I started with the beef tartar app.  I was actually sort of bland, so I had to ask for salt.  The potatoes that accompanied the dish only served to dull the flavour further.  The tartar I had at Le Select was much tastier.  For the entre, I had the scallops, king crab and drunken lobster dish.  The scallop was ok, but it was drowning in too much butter. The other stuff on the dish was sort of unmemorable...so much so I finish the dish like a robot and forgot what I just tasted.  I guess the hi-light of the night were the souffles we ordered.  They look impressive, and tasted pretty good.  I haven't had many souffles in the past, so I don't remember if they are suppose to be that \"airy\".  They were so airy that sometimes it was hard to taste anything because that big spoonful I just stuffed in my mouth was literally 90% air."}
{"text":"Super intimate restaurant with an innovative approach to maximizing their space without foregoing comfort: the bar chairs looked comfortable and it's a lot better than trying to pack people in like sardines.  Thankfully they were able to accommodate my request for a proper table but I guess that depends on what other reservations they have.    The menu is interesting - a lot of bone marrow I feel.   To start I had the squid which came with avocado tempura and guacamole - I found it a little odd to have avocado twice but everything was cooked perfectly and it was delicious.   For main course I had the salmon with hazelnut, shrimp and sweet potato. Absolutely delicious.    The chocolate soufflé took a while as they can only cook one at a time so the wait was longer than 20 minutes but it was worth it.  The sauce was a little rich and I think it would have been nice to have something to contrast it more rather than more chocolate.    Overall the restaurant was accommodating to dietary needs and provided tasty food in a lovely environment.    I took a star off as a few little things were off: the mock tails were inventive but limited and the service was good but a little lacking in the personal touch."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Delicious. Superlative. Intimate. Romantic. I love love this place. Go for every birthday, anniversary or any reason at all and you will find much to celebrate.   I go often and eat well and am treated like an old friend even by new staff who don't know me. They are all well versed in the menu, knowledgeable about wine and passionate about the experience the customer will have.  All menu items come in a small and a large size so you can really tailor to suit your appetite.   Due to the tiny size of this gem they can only take reservation for parties of 4."}
{"text":"I finally visited Ici a few months ago with several friends who were excited about this new addition to Harbord St. After hearing rave reviews, especially from Joanne K in the Globe and Mail and down the blogosphere grapevine, we finally had a chance to see what this place was all about. Unfortunately it fell flat.   The deconstructed cassoulet, that night's special, resembled nothing of the traditional heavy meaty beany French affair. Instead pieces of white sausages, duck confit were ladled over underdone beans so hard and gritty that we didn't bother finishing it. A steak also came out with a powerful sauce that it was unfortunately either burned or over caramelized.  And a Marget duck with an orange sauce whose flavors stung of fennel and orange that it blew away its meat. It was accompanied by a sweet pudding that really deserved to be with the desserts.  The highlight really were in the appetizers, in the charcouterie, the terrine and the croquettes that we easily gobbled up. However the mains were such a let down, that we forgot about the starters at the end of the night.   Given that this place is small (like super small with only 20 seats!) it is a given that they do make reservation for only two seatings. However with 2 hours to eat one would expect service to be prompt and time efficient. It was not. Our two hours were consumed waiting for our mains which took unusually long. So long in fact that when we were finished we were asked to make way for the second seating. No dessert, no apologies.  Unsatisfied by our experience and wanting something to cap off our night we walked to Splendido to make things right. Dessert, coffee and a charcouterie board topped our stomach for the evening there. Too bad it couldn't happen where we started off.  However given that it just opened, perhaps there has been some kinks already worked out. Perhaps next time will be better."}
{"text":"On mange bien à Ici.  Six of us went last night - all for the first time. None of us were disappointed.  Each dish comes in 2 sizes - medium and large. Very convenient as you decide if you want something as a starter or a main.  Everything on the menu was good. The real standouts were the steak tartare, the lobster bisque and poisson provençale. The boeuf bourgignonne and the magret de canard were also both inventive twists on the classic French dishes.  The trio desserts - chocolate, apple, and lemon, respectively - were also highlights. The cheese plate, by contrast, though large in portion, was a little underwhelming.  The wine list is quite good, and reasonably priced.  The wait staff is knowledgable and very friendly.  It's a wonderful local business that deserves a visit, and will keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend to Ici for a birthday dinner. Service was great and food was amazing. I think this is my favourite restaurant in the city.  The lobster bisque was the highlight but every dish was great. We shared the tartar, scallops, foie gras, and the braised beef.  And because it was for my boyfriend's birthday, the chef prepared a special dessert for us with a candle and had \"happy birthday\" written out in chocolate. That made him feel very special and it's nice to know that this isn't a pretentious restaurant who feel they are too good to do something special for a customer celebrating a birthday occasion, (unlike something that I experienced at Actinolite). Ici is a tad pricy but it is totally worth it and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!!  Came here tonight for my husband's birthday. It is a nice and cozy little restaurant.  We were seated at the bar, and it was lovely. First of all, right away the waiter wished my husband a happy birthday.  Then he had lots of recommendations on the food and wine. We decided to go with the escargots and the merguez sausage as appetizers.  Then we went with braised beef and the duck as our mains.  We finished the evening with the chocolate soufflé. There was not one bad bite.  Everything was done to perfection...down to every little detail.  They finished the evening with a happy birthday written out in chocolate, served with two little chocolates. We found the waitstaff super friendly and attentive. There was lots of regulars tonight, and we can see why people keep coming back. A true gem."}
{"text":"WOW! I can not compliment the Chef and kitchen people for creating an amazing taste experience. Been there twice in the last 1.5 months and can't wait to go back. We did the wine paring with our selections and it was a great. If you can swing it you have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Incredible meal, lovely atmosphere, and great service! The Valentine's Day menu was beautifully planned out.  While everything was delicious, the lobster bisque was, without a doubt, the highlight. Rich, creamy, flavourful, and perfect.  The 'Cinderella salad' was light and refreshing, and the fried goat's cheese was beautifully rich  and soft.  The braised beef was remarkably tender and flavourful.  The Grand Marnier soufflé was easily the best soufflé I have ever eaten.  Wine recommendations complemented everything wonderfully."}
{"text":"A-MAZ-ING!!!  I had an absolutely fabulous dinner here!!!!  Everything about this place is charming! Especially given that it was winter, it made it so special to come in from the cold into this 24-seat, cozy, warmly-lit ,open-kitchen environment. If you come in a pair you will be seated at a bar-style table, larger groups get actual tables (note: the biggest group they will accommodate is 4 people).  Reservations are hard to come by and its not cheap, but his is the type of place us foodies yearn for.  Portions come in both \"large\" and \"small\" format which is why there is double pricing beside each.  There are also two suggested pairings for each meal of both a Canadian and french wine.  The interesting thing about the wine pairings is that they come in 3 different sizes.  I really find that wine pairings can take a meal to the next level so this made me very happy because you can order a 3 oz size pairing for each course which was just enough to get through the meal (and its a titch more affordable). The idea is to \"create your own menu\" (as our server said).  It was more like a \"choose your own gastronomical adventure\"!   The Service- Our server was absolutely lovely and as authentically French as they come (she was actually from Marseilles). I could see she was keeping an eye on us throughout the meal and was conscious to ensue that the flow/timing of our dishes was perfect.  We started with cocktails and I had a deliciously refreshing with elderflower liqueur and not too fruity/sweet at all which is usually something I am concerned about.  Since our table wasn't entirely ready when we arrived, we were guided to stand at this platform that was literally adjacent to the open kitchen and right next to the Jean-Pierre in action!  He offered us some fresh goat cheese tarts with caramelized onions which were succulent, moist and deliciously flavourful.    We started with the lobster bisque at a very strong suggestion by our server.  It came with a piece of shrimp covered in a crispy batter (not tempura, way crispier).  The bisque was just packed with flavour and lighter in consistency than most I've tried - a big winner and the perfect size in its small format.  Next was the escargots which came almost in a salad-like format with puffed pastries incorporated.  I'm used to traditional escargot so trying them in this dish gave me a real appreciation for the flavour they have on their own.  The addition of macadamia nuts was lovely!  The dish that followed was the Drunken Lobster, Scallops and King Crab - this was A-MAZING!!!!  Every part of it blew me away and the pairing with the Stratus Tollgate made it that much more interesting.  The lobster was juicy and packed with flavour and the scallops done to perfection  Finally, our last dish was my hands down favourite.  It was foie gras in a beet \"oreo\" with duck prosciutto.  This was the BEST foie gras I have ever had.  It was like eating butter but 10x as delicious.  The duck prosciutto was rich and yummy and whatever it was wrapped around was sweet so it really contrasting the foie gras/beet combo nicely.   Unfortunately we were stuff after all of the above, but I will DEFINITELY be back and next time can't wait to try the souffle!"}
{"text":"It's AMAZING! We did 4 appetizer plates and 1 main. It gives us the opportunity to try different dishes.   -Lobster bisque: The best I ever had. It tastes like the sea. Awesome flavour. It's not heavy with cream.  -Steak tartare: The best I ever had. Very tasty. Nicely seasoned.  -Foie Gras \"Au Naturel\" & Black Trumpet Croquette: It melts in my mouth. I must say this is my favourite dish of the evening. The richness of the foie gras and pungent flavour of the trumpet is just spectacular. -Rack of Lamp: It is SO tendered. -Seared Scallop, King Crab, Beurre Blanc Poached Lobster & Acadian Caviar: The waiter suggest we get the main because the appertizer portion will be too small to share. Seared scallop is paired with pear which is a perfect pairing.  -Praline souffle have a hint of orange. It's light and just the right amount of sweetness.  Service is great. Waiter is very helpful.  I think this might be my favorite restaurant in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place was a treat - great service, great food, and a unique atmosphere with an open kitchen.  While there I tasted 5 dishes: tartare, bisque, scallops, beef, and creme brulee. Food-wise it was not a perfect experience but I still don't hesitate to give them 5 stars overall.  The lobster bisque and the steak tartare were the best I've ever had (these are must try items if they are on the menu when you go). The crab-stuff scallops are like nothing I have ever seen before and something you'll probably never see anywhere else -- my mouth is watering and I feel like I am still tasting it when I picture the dish in my mind.  I was probably disappointed by the next dish because the bar was set so high with the dishes mentioned above, but the braised beef dish was a big flop for me. The beef was under-seasoned, and there was a something needed to give relief from the rather heavy dish: on the side, there are crispy bone barrow balls that were desperate for a better companion than a bit of artichoke paste (if I'm remembering correctly what that was).  The meal was finished with creme brulee with a custard fit for the gods. Eat this and you'll feel like you're falling in love (order it and share if you're there with a date!). Now, personally I didn't enjoy the pairing of sauternes (as suggested by them), because I think creme brulee is too sweet and it belongs with a cheese plate or foie gras; still, I can't fault them for that because it's a well-known and well-liked pairing.  I will most definitely be returning in the winter to see what they come up with for their winter menu (I just hope the braised beef is gone). It is not cheap (think $100/head if you go all-out), but it has an elevated style you won't get often (let alone successfully replicate at home)."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate an intimate birthday with my boyfriend after receiving some recommendations and Ici really delivered! To start - the service is fantastic! Servers are on point, have extensive knowledge of the menu and wines and are just the right amount of friendly!   We started with the steak tartare (a must have!) and our server sold us on the savoyard (served with a Quebec cheese on the side) and it was beyond good. Excellent recommendation!   For our mains, I got the scallops with king crab and drunken lobster - everything was cooked to perfection; though it was served with an unmemorable side potato - I would have liked to see some greens or veggie instead. Just a thought.   My boyfriend got the duck plate and it was absolutely delicious. It also came with these little mushroom fritter/dumplings - SO GOOD.  For dessert we ended with one of Ici's famous souffles. I went with the grand marnier as the other option was chocolate and cherry (I hate chocolate with fruit). It was a little boozy but it's perfection made up for that.   To sum up - don't miss the tartare or the souffle!"}
{"text":"Ici Bistro est à la cuisine française de Toronto ce qu'il y a de meilleur. Non seulement Jean-Pierre est un véritable passionné des arts culinaires, son savoir faire est unique et sans compromis. Ici Bistro est un petit restaurant au Nord du quartier de Little Italy où il faut réserver des semaines à l'avance !  An amazing little bistro that went through a lot just to open. Let's forget the narrow-minded politicos who tried to keep this place from opening - I won't mention Pantalone - for reasons that are still a complete mystery to us. Let's focus on the amazing cuisine chef Jean-Pierre Challet offers his patrons. Jean-Pierre is always searching out for new ideas and has such passion for food his enthusiasm is contagious.   If you're tired of the fake-french cuisine and Toronto's obsession with everything goat-cheese and portobello, go to ICI Bistro for a true culinary experience and savoir vivre  !"}
{"text":"What a cute, quaint restaurant! A group of four girlfriends and I dined here for a nice meal on our trip to Toronto. Make reservations! There's only about 20 seats in the house. The restaurant is warm with a cozy vibe with stellar, attentive service. Being able to see the chefs preparing your meal in the open kitchen was also a plus.  When we arrived, our table was not yet ready so we were greeted with glasses of wine and a complimentary appetizer. I love restaurants that know the importance of hospitality.  Between the five of us, we were able to try:  -Lobster Bisque -Duck Margret -Scallops and King Crab, Drunken Lobster -Braised Beef  My dish was the duck. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly; the meat was tender and melted in your mouth. Tied for favorite would be the scallops and king crab--the flavor was delicious. Lobster bisque was also seasoned well.   For dessert, we ordered soufflés to split. They were very large, fluffy, and melted in your mouth. A very tasty treat, but definitely too much food after our delicious entrees!  It's easy to immediately see this restaurant is one that puts its heart into treating its patrons with care and serving delicious, well-crafted food. This place is a great example of culinary done right. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner and it was absolutely wonderful from beginning to end. Definitely tops my list for most romantic dining experience in Toronto.  Make sure to get reservations well in advance. My boyfriend booked three weeks before, albeit for a Saturday evening, but the only option was 8:45 (which worked really well for us).  What we had: Croquettes Escargots Lamb quartet Braised beef Souffle  They had the option to order a small or large portion of each dish, which was great for sampling. We ordered the small version of everything so that we could have a larger selection.  Croquettes were delicious. We couldn't agree on which stood out more, the truffle or the gnocchi. The escargots dish was incredible, the grapes were a perfect addition to the salty, buttery goodness of the rest of the dish. Lamb quartet was my boyfriend's favourite of the night. The braised beef was, expectedly, awesome.  They asked if it was special occasion, and we told them it was my birthday. I normally wouldn't do that for fear of being embarrassed, but it was a clear a place like this wouldn't suck all the class out of the evening with some obnoxious \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY\" announcement. They brought over a beautiful plate which they'd written \"Happy Birthday\" on in chocolate, and included two tiny white chocolate cups with cherries. Probably the most tasteful recognition of a birthday I've ever seen at a restaurant.  Even though we were getting very full, we had to try their signature souffle and we were glad we did.   The entire dinner took about three hours which, I think, is the best possible way to spend a Saturday evening. The wine, the service and especially the food made this place one of the best dining experiences I've had in Toronto. Amazing."}
{"text":"I have been to a variety of restursunts ranging from McDonalds to Michelin Rated restursunts. I have never had such a terrible dining experience.   Our waiter took 10 minites to come to oir table initially. We indicated that we were eager to order as we had plans after dinner we wanted to get to. The waiter did not return for another 15 minutes after that. We then asked for a wine menu that took another 10 minutes to show up.  Prior to attending we confirmed the advertised menu as including a \"welcome drink\" as part of our set-course menu for $125. The waiter said he was not aware of it and would look into it. While bad enough not being aware of the menu, he did not bother to look into it an ignored our inquiry all together.   We were asked by the assistant manager if we would like our meal served family style in order to speed up service for our group of 7. Our group clearly indicated we would rather not. However our apps came out family style. We raised the issue with the assistant manager who said it would be rectified for the rest of the meal.   There was clear breakdown in communication within the staff as all of the remaining courses were served family style ie they piled the food on one big plate and we had to serve ourselves. This was an issue for our entree particularly because the waiter did not bother to bring us plates. When we asked for plates, he brought us little side plates and we were left to attempt to cut our overcooked steaks on an undersized dish.  We ordered a bottle of wine which was not brought to our table until after we completed 90% of our entree. Really no point in wine after the meal.   The waiter was not only inattentive, but grew to be rude and patronizing after I asked the assistant manager that our meal not be served family style. He commented on our group of 30-35 year olds as \"the gang\" and \"crazy kids\". While this may not have been a big deal ordinarily (but one would think that in a place that is supposed to be one of repute there would be some more formality), these comments were clearly passive aggressive indicating he didn't like how we raised some concerns with the assistant manager.   We were not offered coffee or tea after the meal. There were several errors on our bill that including charges for things we didn't order. This took some time to rectify. And while realizing we were in a rush, the waiter proceeded to clear empty tables rather than bring us the bill to sign.   I will say aside from an overcooked entree the food itself wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about either.   Overall, I was shocked to the point where it actuslly ruined my night. And I am not one who is overly picky or easily upset. With so many other amazing options in this city, don't waste time with this one."}
{"text":"I made my reservation 2 months ago.  This place only has 24 seats, only open Wednesday to Saturday and only for dinner, so count yourself lucky if you can get a seat!  It also didn't help that they closed for a few weeks in March.  OpenTable helped me figure out when a table might be free.  Note: max party size is 4 (accordingly to their website).  The service was fantastic from the moment I walked in.  The kind hostess took my coat for me and then seated me in one of the best seats in the restaurant - looking right into the kitchen!  It's completely open so you can watch the magic happen.  I ordered the French 75 cocktail because it seemed appropriate.  It was a perfect choice for me.  They have a few other interesting options.  My date highly enjoyed the Harmonica.  Ici also offers an extensive wine list.  Lucky for me, a diner who likes to try everything, Ici offers most menu options in a small portion and a large portion.  I had already chosen the snails and the braised beef for myself, so I was excited and on board when my date suggested we share a few dishes, to maximize variety.  We added the duck confit and the fish.  In order of arrival: -amuse-bouche: goat cheese tartlet.  Perfect warm-up.  Light and flaky pastry, smoothe and creamy filling.  Bonus points for being adorable. -bread basket: loved the thin crispy ones!  -duck confit: very rich, nice with the sweet figs.  The toast it's served with is just okay.  I'd recommend saving the bread from the basket for this. -snails: my favourite dish of them all.  Served with a delicious creamy sauce.  We couldn't get enough and ended up cleaning the plate!   -fish: cooked perfectly (on the rare side - soft, tender, flaky) -braised beef:  o.m.g.  I've never tasted anything so delicious.  Sadly I was starting to get full by this point and could only handle a few bites.  This is a must try.  -soufflé for dessert: I opted for the pralines version (also available with Grand Marnier).  Double o.m.g.  This was my very first soufflé and will definitely not be my last.  Everything was presented beautifully on the plates.  The highly attentive and friendly staff provided new sharing plates for every dish and changed our cutlery each time.  I appreciated the descriptions when each plate was introduced to the table.  The waitress told us the soufflés rarely ever fail.  She estimated maybe 1 in 100 soufflés doesn't make it, and even then it's only just short of perfect - not a complete fail.  Well, it seems our questions about the art and science of soufflé-making put too much pressure on the chef.  And sure enough, mine didn't make it!  I had to wait extra long for my dessert because it had to be re-made.  I appreciated that the waitress notified us of the mishap.  She promised it was well worth the wait..... and was right.  Despite being fuller than full, I was able to scarf down every crumb of the warm, sweet, gooey deliciousness.  I was afraid to look when the bill came because we had each ordered a cocktail, 4 dishes (small), dessert and sparkling water for the table.  This all rang in around $130, plus tip.  The food ranges from $11 to $30 each, cocktails approximately $14 each.  The 4 small portions for us was just right and allowed us to try a few things.  I'm very happy with the choices we made, but also saw lots of other menu items pass through the kitchen that looked equally good.  Ici is my new favourite restaurant!  I don't think I could come here too often, since it's hard to get a table, and it's on the pricey end by the time you add everything together.  It's also a little bit rich to be eating everyday.  I truly enjoyed the quality of every bite of food served, the beautiful presentation and the superb service.  Little details like my water glass never being empty, the new cutlery with each dish and the recipe card that came with the bill all make for a fantastic, memorable dining experience.  Merci Ici!  Fancy a challenge?  Here are some hints for making a perfect soufflé: http://www.getcracking.ca/tq-souffles.html"}
{"text":"French bistro fare of the fussy/small plate variety done right. From the bread to the lobster bisque to the lyonnaise salad and bouillabaisse, very high quality ingredients blended well and of just enough portion to satisfy and leave the palate ready for the next dish. My favourite parts were the cheese tart appetizer-- a small and devlish treat-- and the wine pairings. Quite simply the best wine recommendations I've had in Toronto. Without them, the food might have been a bit too rich. The wine elevated the experience meaningfully.   A bit of a splurge price wise but the atmosphere is very nice and feels perfect for a special date or celebration. Service is also impeccable."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem.  Attentive service, artful plating, brilliant technique.  All plates can be ordered as an app or main and priced accordingly.  Wine pairings come in 3 or 6 oz pours, which is great because if you're the driver you can still sample two wines and drive home.  We had the foie gras (generous and decdent), the calamari avocado dish , the scallops (phenomenal) and the lamb. The restaurant is tiny, maybe 20 seats, and some of the seating options are not great.  If you are a party of 2 you will likely get seated at the tiny bar.  There is one pretty bad table right near the door where you are likely to get enveloped in the red velvet curtains as the next diners make their way into the restaurant.  Ask to sit along the banquette if you are able, those tables are the best.  The professional service smooths over these minor disturbances.  For cooking like this I would still put up with it!  And the bill....well, it's priced according to the fabulous ingredients they use.  It's an indulgent evening in every respect."}
{"text":"Didnt think lobster bisque would taste so good in a cappuccino cup. Perfectly seasoned and frothed made it a delight!  The soufflé, I would wait an hour for. Fluffy, tasty, just perfect!"}
{"text":"Wanted to come before they move off to the Windsor Arms.  Food summary at the bottom since we had so many good options and enjoyed it so much.  Yup, this place is that good.  Service: Top notch.  Very nice and helpful.  Ambience: Good use of the space.  They didn't try to cram in more people, which is nice.  Modern.  Wondering what it'll be like at the hotel now...  Wine: Good selection.  I liked the fact that I was able to have smaller, but more glasses.  Food: Top notch.  My goodness, JP never disappoints.  I loved going to The Fifth when he was there, and went once after he left; and never returned.  The menu definitely has its share of richness, and value & pricing were very good, especially with the small/large options.  For the size of people we had, we had a ton of food.  Starters Lobster bisque: My father said it's better than Jacobs' when they had theirs.  Best in city? Oysters: Very fresh & tasty. Croquettes: Soooo rich. The wild mushroom with black truffles... Wow. Charcuterie: I enjoyed it, and in retrospect, I think it might've been one of the top 5 I've ever had. Steak tartare trio: This is what I came for.  Top marks here too.  This could be a meal in itself.  I'm a big tartare (all kinds) fan.  Mains Lamb: Best entree we had. Escargots: Ok... my father wasn't blown away. Fish: Very solid, but I still think Woods has a better one. Duck: Very good.  But not as good as the lamb!  Desserts Souffles - Grand Marnier & Chocolate.  My advice: get both.  Oh, you're there by yourself?  Get both.  They're large for one, but sharing this might leave you wanting for more."}
{"text":"This restaurant was truly impressive. I am still blown away by how perfect it was. The beef tartare was the best I've ever had -- perfectly balanced, generously portioned (arguably too generous), genuinely delicious. The lobster bisque was the best I've ever had as well -- the balance of textures and the depth of flavour almost had me out of my chair! The other dishes -- I had the escargots, foie gras, scallop / crab / lobster, and souffle dishes -- were executed to near perfection. My only complaint was the souffle, which had split (it was likely worked too much). They do have a chef fully dedicated to making souffles, but he had left already (we ate pretty late into the night). I suspect that if he had been the one making the souffle, it would've been perfect. You're missing out if you don't come here."}
{"text":"Six o'clock reservation?  A first for us, but we hurried to be on time and so did our friends.... glad we started early as we had the most amazing dinner and rounded it off with a selection of amazing deserts."}
{"text":"Started with a lobster bisque. The soup was ok but it came with a really delicious shrimp. Best shrimp I've ever had. Got the escargots as appertizer. it was not bad. Got the duck and lamb for entree. Both were yummy. Ordered both vanilla and chocolate souffle. Kinda dissapointed with the souffle. It was good but just not as good as expected."}
{"text":"6:30 - Wow, what a cozy little place, I'm so excited to eat here, everything on the menu sounds absolutely delicious.  Chef Decorte came around and welcomed us, giving off a wonderfully warm aura. This place is definitely super friendly, me likes.  6:50 - Oh emm gee, the amuse was appetite whetting and an annoying tease. I'm absolutely starved and craving more.  7:00 - Pre-apps arrive and I'm ecstatic. Delicious croquettes, rich foie gras torchon, silky smooth chacuterie, deeply flavouful terrines, accompanied with some of the most amazing bread I've ever eaten. Getting my wine glassed re-filled and I'm feeling all warm and fuzzy.  7:27 - Sharing four dishes as our real apps, fish soup, steak tartare with fingerling potatoes, deliciously creamy and garlicy escargot, more croquettes. Second bottle of wine ordered and opened.  7:45 - Happily waiting for mains, good conversation, good people, all smiles.  8:00 - Still waiting...  Haven't seen our waitress in a while, getting a bit drunk at this point.   8:21 - Our food finally arrives and... hey! it's extremely disappointing.  The duck marget was imo inedible as it had an extremely bitter flavor akin to cough medicine, the cassoulet was flavorless - beans completely undercooked and difficult to eat served with chewy, unappealing duck.  The duo of beef was decent, but really under seasoned but at this point I had lost my appetite and enthusiasm to continue.  8:37 - We're informed that we need to leave as the second seating is about to begin.  No time of coffee or dessert, get out, you took too long waiting for your food.  9:00 - We take refuge at Splendido for our desserts and aperitifs (and more chacuterie)  What started off as a fantastic dining experience quickly soured and turned into a punchline for the rest of the night.  What a shame because Ici Bistro went from being completely awesome to total disappointment within a 30 minute time span.  Maybe we were just unlucky.. oh well."}
{"text":"Last night I went for a dinner and a \"show\" at Jean-Pierre Challet's Ici Bistro.  Book your seats in advance as this theatre is quite small, seating about 20 or so.  We arrived promptly at 8PM and our usher brought us to our box seats (read, bar seats) which gave us an almost eye level view of the main stage (read, the kitchen) which is slightly elevated from its audience (read, the tables).  In this small production, four stars (chefs) graced the stage this evening, each delivering a fine performance in their titular roles.  The highlight of the evening for me was when the Kitchen Aid went on to prepare fresh components for our dessert.  The narrator (read, our server) for the evening was authentically French (from Toulon) and mesmerized this audience with his charm.  He was always on cue - ensuring that our water glasses were topped up, and replacing our plates after every act (read, course) was over.  He also bore a striking resemblance to Colin Farrell.  In fact, when I began saying \"Has anyone ever told you you look like...\" he replied \"Yes\" even before I uttered the name.  A list of wines was available with Canadian and French choices exclusively.  Finally, a restaurant with a longer list of wines by the glass (3 oz or 6 oz).  I opted for an Alsatian Domaine Zind-Humbrecht Gewurztraminer.  The amuse-bouche was a creamy Goat Cheese Tartlet followed by a bread basket featuring JP's yummy baguettes, which almost always sell out at his Leslieville boulangerie, Le Matin .  The neatest thing about the menu at Ici Bistro is that the mains come in both appetizer and entrée size which means you can sample many of the delicious dishes without having to don your stretchy pants.  Seeing as the Oysters seemed to be popular among the crowd we opted for a half dozen.  Tonight's selection came from Prince Edward Island, accompanied with a generous amount of lemon wedges, fresh horse radish and sherry vinaigrette with crunch roe.  The 2 slices of rye bread that accompanied the condiments had us scratching our heads, but upon inquiring we learned that you are supposed to take a bite of bread to finish.  This foreign idea was a great one, as the bread actually prolonged the end notes of the oysters, while dousing the acidity and tartness of the vinaigrette.  I wanted to stand up and scream encore!  For our mains, we opted for the Stuffed Scallop.  This dish had great textural balance with a thinly sliced fried pear, a cilantro/ginger/king crab filling, Parmesan polenta and Espelette mayonaise.  The scallops were cooked perfectly; the poached lobster was heaven in every bite; and the polenta cubes were buttery and cheesy.  We also opted for the Duck Magret, served with an aromatic fennel/honey/lavender/star anise reduction.  The flavours were very bold which held up against the richness of the duck with an absolutely delicious caramelized reduction.  While I understand the potato dauphinois and parsnips were intended to play supporting roles, the flavours were very muted after having tasted the duck.  Like the holy trinities that appeared on every dish - I too am a firm believer in three's.  So having had our appetizer (1) and main (2), we aptly opted for the Trio of Lemon and an Americano.  I have tasted JP's lemon tart before at Le Matin and was delighted to taste it again!  The trio consisted of the luscious lemon tart, ice cream and frozen raspberries finished with a Chiboust cream and brûléed topping.  V E R D I C T  Ici Bistro is a place that you seek out because of its reputation.  It is located in an obscure corner with nothing but a church and a convenience store surrounding it.  The dishes are thoughtfully crafted, with textural balances in mind, and the goal of winning your taste buds over with rich and lingering flavours.  It is a restaurant that you could literally spend hours in, as the kitchen prepares  your meal with care and with heart.  And if they can't convince you to stay, the staff will definitely charm you into having another glass of wine.  Bon appétit!"}
{"text":"Warning: So the original location closed and Ici Bistro moved to the Windsor Arms Hotel. While this might have been my favourite place in the city, everyone has said the new place is not very good.   Ici Bistro is not cheap and not easy to get into, but it is/was easily one of the best restaurants in the city.   Everything was gorgeous from the scallops to our main course to our delectable desserts.   As indicated, the only downsides are the price and the fact that you need to book a reservation a month or two in advance."}
{"text":"The food, the service and wine suggestions are phenomenal! And they were so incredibly thoughtful for my birthday with complimentary apps and dessert."}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy. Fabulous food, excellent service, a wonderful way to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Simply the best food I've ever had in Toronto!!!.  Went there for the second time yesterday and it was as good if not better then the first time.  Not sure why yelp filtered my first review, but hopefully this one will stay on here for a while."}
{"text":"We ate here on our first night in Toronto, and I'm soooo glad we did. At the same time, I wish we hadn't because every meal afterwards just didn't live up to Ici. It's located on this very quiet corner and there are only a small handful of tables. Quite intimate!   The hostesses were very friendly. We told them we were Americans (something I'm never sure if we should say or not in Canada. LOL) and they graciously welcomed us. We had another person join our party of four last minute so luckily they were able to accomodate. Being from the U.S., all of us were too cheap to buy an international phone plan. Therefore, practically everywhere we went we asked if they had wifi. (I know. I know.) And they did, and were nice enough to share the password and gave us access. YAY! A connection to the outside world. (Hellllloooo Facebook, Instagram and Yelp!)   They started us off with these satisfying tarts. Definitely whet our appetites. For sharing, we ordered the lobster bisque and shrimp frite. Oh yes. In the words of Britney Spears, \"Gimme More!!\" Slightly on the fishy side (perhaps they used shrimp stock? Hmm...), but still fantastic. The braised beef was tasty. We didn't order the marrow, but I regret it now. I heard it is pretty awesome there. The avocado and calamari dish was out of this world. I mean, who doesn't like avocado and calamari? Put it together: A symphony of flavors and textures!   The sommelier, along with the waitstaff, were very knowledgable about the dishes, the ingredients, and in the case of our wine, the process of how the grapes were grown. They offered this information - unsolicited - without sounding pretentious or smug. I appreciated that. It shows, at least to me, a passion for food and how/where the ingredients are sourced. Ici is a fine place to go with friends, and at least from what I saw, that *ahem* \"special someone.\" Oooh la la! I would love to return upon my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"From my preivous dining experience with ici before, I knew how hard it was to book a table. Now that they moved to Windsor arms hotel, they made it even more difficult! Reservation section on their website says \"under construction\", their phone number is \"not in service/not assigned\"; I had to called the hotel & asked them to transfer me to the restaurant. Had to took one star away because of that.   First impression when I walked in is that the place is very very quiet. Unlike their old site, they hid their kitchen away, couldn't see chefs cooking anymore. Half of the food items were gone from their old menu. Steak tartare is tasty as before; potatoes were crispy, tartare itself was fresh. Beef carpaccio was a bit disappointing as it was too salty. We also shared the grill platter. Beef was cooked to perfection, chicken was moist, fried calamari was crunchy. Last but not least, souffle!!!!! It was so light and fluffy! Yum!  Will come back for their tartare and souffle again!"}
{"text":"Go! Seriously! These guys have worked hard for nearly 2 years fighting city hall to get this place open and it is fantastic.  The staff are friendly, obliging, helpful, etc. The chef is also the owner, J.P Challet, and his partner is running the front room. Ask them anything about the menu, they'll help you.  Food is delicious, good wine list.  It's a small small room, and we went during the first week when no one knew it was open. Apparently now it's tough to get reservations. They do have bench seats looking out the window, and we had the one facing Harbord. This was a good seat, as we watched the world go by while dining on delicious French cuisine.  As we were finishing up, we could smell bacon. MMMM, They make bacon scones for Sam James coffee shop across the street. Another reason to love Harbord Street.  So, what are you waiting for? Call and make a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been struggling with this one.  It has been a couple of months since my wife and I had dinner here.  It was a huge disappointment, so much so, that I didn't want to write a review at all.  I thought with time, my memories would fade but they didn't.  Let me start with the positive:  Good atmosphere, awesome service and great wine pairings.  The appetizers were pretty good, we had Plateau of Charcuterie.    Unfortunately the app was the best part of the meal, hence the one star review.  I had the braised beef and my wife had Duck Magrite.  My beef was way over cooked, dry and stringy drenched in rich gravy.  The bone marrow croquets were awful.  Cold and solid in the middle with a slightly off taste.  Duck was tough and tasteless, and again covered in rich gravy.  We also had Foie Gras and it was disappointing, it tasted like pate with pork undertones.    My review is definitely against the grain.  Maybe we didn't order the right dishes, maybe the chef had an off night."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to check it out for some time now and they posted on facebook about a cheese they brought in from France, so we just had to go. We arrived a bit early and this was not a problem.  It's a very intimate venue with lovely music playing not too loud in the background and a full view of the kitchen brigade.  We decided that since it was Thursday and we came for the cheese, that was a special enough occassion to spoil ourselves and do the suggested wine pairing with each course (I cannot remember all the wines so forgive me)  Our Amuse was a lovely quennelle fritter of cod and sweet potato served with a spicy aoli served with a sweet sparkling wine from the south of France.  Nice start, and it just kept getting better.  We decided to share the steak tartare, there are 3 choices but we went with traditional.  It was beautifully seasoned, an excellent sized portion with fluffy little potato pillows with a lovely flute of rose champagne.  What I love about the place is you have about 10 items on the menu, each comes in either an appetizer size or a larger dinner portion.  This just screams to me, hey we can eat even more of the menu than we thought.  To start I had a foie gras torchon sandwiched between little teeny beet pankcakes, presented as foie gras oreos mmmmm foie gras anything for me please. It came with a sliced apple and beet salad that included soaked prunes wrapped in duck proscuitto.  Now I don't believe in god but I do believe in food heaven and I knew biting into this that we might just be there. Dining mate had the delicate Gaspe shrimp ceviche with a little buffala mozzarella and tomato salad.  Well of course we were tasting each others food.  This was amazing, with hints of ginger and the presentation was beautiful.  Okay time for some hot sticky meats in bordelaise, I opted for the braised beef served with the creamiest smoothest mash ever, mushrooms artichokes served with an artichoke cream and crispy marrow balls.   My friend opted for the lamb trio, there was loin, chop and braised shoulder that was served as a stuffed cannelloni in an upright position to look like a bone marrow.  The table was pretty silent at this point with the exception of mmmmmmmmmmm and maybe more mmmmmmmmmmmm, at the end he said there was just the perfect amount of jus on my plate for everything.  Meats were perfection, falling apart, seasoned and sauced in every way perfect.  I do believe we consumed some stratus, fielding, hidden bench and malivoire wines during these courses, I do recall a fume blanc and pinot noir a gamay and a gewurtztraminer.  Dessert we chose the cherry chocolate souffle and the lemon tart with goat cheese lemon cheese cake with strawberry sorbet.  The souffle was presented with a serving bowl of warm rich chocolate sauce which was poured into a cavity poked in the middle and a warm cherry surprise in the base.  Best lemon tart on the planet and I know lemon tart.  What I loved was the goat cheese explosion that happened in my mouth when I had taken a bite of the cheesecake and then a sip of the paired wine.  Ah now it's time for the reason we came, the cheese, which was served with fortified wines from France, Rhone if memory serves correctly.  We had a couple of Quebec cheeses, a lovely truffle infused cheese from Italy, Manchego from Spain a soft stinky one from Rhone and the cheese of the moment Le Geant du Rhone.  Both of us love our cheese and this was the only way to end the meal and our first and not last experience at ICI.  My compliments to the wonderful staff in the kitchen and dining room, they even matched our cutlery to our outfits, which was just too funny. Your table is completely cleared and reset for each course, which is a wonderful touch.  The breads are all made in house and available at the chef's bakery, Le Matin in Leslieville, and it was nice to get butter at room temperature that spread instead of a lump of cold butter you can't get your knife into.  Our experience was superb we will be back"}
{"text":"The best dining experience I have had in Toronto. The staff were warm, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable. Every course on the prix fixe menu wowed us more. Couldn't have asked for a better Valentines day!"}
{"text":"I fully expected to be giving this place five stars....I'm shocked that I'm not.   We wanted to eat here for months but never had the foresight to make rezzies far enough in advance. The place was always full by the time we checked availability on opentable (and no wonder....they only have a handful of tables and bar seats inside the cute space). We finally smartened up and booked a table several weeks in advance for our anniversary.  The menu is wonderful in that every item is available in small or large portions (even the daily fish) so you can create your own tasting menu. Each item also has not one, but two suggested wine pairings...one French and one Ontario (available in 3oz or 6oz.) So we ordered five dishes and instead of a bottle of wine, we opted to try one of each pairing with each dish.  We started with the luxe-cerise cocktail (highly recommended) and a glass of the French aperitif, lillet. Lovely.  Steak Tartare \"au naturel\" ($24) was deliciously seasoned and perfectly matched with the buttery soft fried potato ball things...but the portion was too big (four large scoops of tartare) and after finishing it we both were starting to get full already!  Lobster bisque with shrimp frites...highlight of the meal. Delightful.  Avocado beignet with crispy squid...not too shabby.  Fish of the day (turbot with beurre blanc)...okay, but didn't wow us.  By this point we were so full (and desperately wanting to save room for dessert and cheese) that we sadly cancelled the duck magret with duck confit ravioli...they happily obliged the cancellation.  For dessert, the lemon tart with berry sorbet and goat cheese was yummy.  Cheese plate was fantastic.  Service was outstanding.  All in all, when I compare Ici to another fancy spot we dined at recently (Mistura at Ave/Dav) it unfortunately falls short. Mistura blew us away while Ici was merely great. As one small example, the lemon posset at Mistura reigned supreme over Ici's lemon tart. Having said that, we'll definitely be back to Ici for cocktails and dessert...we still wanna try their famous souffle. Everyone around us was ordering it and it looked divine."}
{"text":"Yum and yum!  Two seatings a night, make sure you call well in advance for this gem on Harbord's foodie lane. I love formal dining with an amuse bouche and wine pairings that truly bring out the best in the food.  The menu is always changing so feel free to keep going back!"}
{"text":"FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!  I chose this small restaurant for my birthday dinner, and couldn't be happier with how it turned out. Booking was a slice on opentable, and we received a voicemail to confirm the reservation.  Service from start to end was phenomenal, both from our server Lucy and (maybe) the co-owner? I can't recall her name, but she was super-enthusiastic about the cocktails she had recently concocted, and was a pleasure to talk to. Patient and exacting, the service from both of these ladies was remarkable.  Beer selection is limited to but well-served by Beau's: Lug Tread and the Festival Ale - the focus here is clearly on the wines. That said, my dining partner very much enjoyed her cocktail.  As others have expounded upon, the mains are available in two sizes: appetizer or main. We did four appetizer-size mains between the two of us, and were well-satiated. We greedily ordered the cheese plate during the halfway mark, which was completely unnecessary; didn't stop us though as the cheeses were awesome - we managed to find the room.  Same goat cheese tart and bread basket to start as others. For mains we ordered: merguez sausage, black cod, trio of lamb, and the braised beef. Honestly, each and every dish knocked it out of the park. I'd happily order any of them again. The server was more than accommodating in helping us make our selection, and was honest with her opinion; to wit: she warned us off sharing the appetizer-size scallops, as it would come with only one mollusk morsel.  We shared the souffle for dessert, which I think was the only portion of the evening that didn't blow it out for me. Sure it was light and fluffy, but it just reminded me of bread pudding and I thought the flavours were a bit flat - at least in comparison to the epic meal that preceded.  No problem though, there are other desserts to try."}
{"text":"I had heard about this restaurant from some friends and wanted to try it for a while, couldn't find a time that worked until this week. Decided to go try it by myself. They don't have a tasting menu, but when I asked about one, they said they could ask the chef to pick plates for me if I'd like. I was happy to not have to decide because everything on the menu looked great. I ended up tasting 5 things in total: tartare, foie gras, duck, lamb, and souffle. The food was great; I had to wait a little bit for the souffle and it was much bigger than I thought it would be. But overall, it was still good. The service (from Chantal) was fantastic! The cost was reasonable.   I would definitely come here again. And I *may* try some other stuff, but it might be hard because what I had was so good that I might just do the same thing all over again =)"}
{"text":"Ici Bistro is a real find, tucked away on Harbord and Manning in a quiet, mostly residential neighbourhood (it's further west than the strip of restaurants near Splendido, Loire, 93 Harbord, etc.). They serve up some of the best French fare in the city in a cozy, intimate setting. The small space seats only 24 (as such, they can only accommodate groups of 4 or less) so make sure to make reservations!   The food is rich and luxurious (no skimping on the cheese or cream!), plating is beautifully done, and the service is spot-on, making this an ideal spot for a date or special occasion. Music is soft and allows for proper conversation. On the night that I went, I heard lots of conversations en Francais and it seems like most servers speak French fluently. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, confidently offering suggestions and able to recommend wine pairings other than the ones listed on the menu.   First, we were brought small goat cheese tarts as am amuse-bouche - a nice beginning. Next, we had the trio of steak tartare. This was absolutely delicious and flavourful. My favourite was the one accompanied with pommes dauphine -- potatoes that were perfectly light and fluffy. Next was the merguez sausage with potato gnocchi, which came with some fresh goat cheese. The sausage was juicy with a hint of spice and the gnocchi were melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Finally, we had the braised beef which was nice and tender (our server explained that the sauce takes days to prepare).  Although the portions don't look that big, most dishes are quite dense and heavy. Each menu item is available in an appetizer size or a entree size. Between my DC and I, we shared the steak tartare trio and 2 \"appetizer size\" items, and we were comfortably full and decided to skip the dessert. They are famous for their souffles though, so I will have to try that next time. Wines are offered in 3oz. or 6 oz. glasses or by the bottle. I like the option of a 3 oz. so you can try more kinds of wine without getting too tipsy!  Ici Bistro is pricey, but worth it for the overall experience and quality of the food. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I too was excited to try this place after JK rated it #5 in her Top 100 list. On the good side of the ledger, the service and wine were great and my chicken dish was incredibly moist and succulent. The Trio of Lemon dessert was very good as well.  On the bad side of the ledger, the rest of our food fell way flat. Did not feel that it was a meal worthy of a #5 rating or $250+ for two people. We won't be back, too many other legitimately great places in the GTA."}
{"text":"A small place such that service is pretty attentive and nice. Menu item quality is a little bit inconsistent.  The top dishes are likely the lobster bisque and the braised beef.  Good wine pairings and cocktails.  Expensive."}
{"text":"un freakin believable!  Lobster bisque,  Souffle, Duck, Carpaccio and service.   go now!"}
{"text":"well worth the wait.   i had the great fortune to arrive yesterday and discover that they had completely overhauled the menu.  Flavour combinations so thought out that one is left to wonder how many hours, days, and weeks of toil were put into each dish, as each aspect of the meal seemed to easily embrace the other.  Whether the goal was contrast or harmony, it all came together with each bite.  Service staff went above and beyond and kept in pace with the wonderful food that was presented to us.  Each member of Ici has a clear goal and that is to ensure that the customer has the dinner experience they came in expecting.  I can't wait to go back."}
