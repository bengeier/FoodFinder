{"text":"I don't understand how this restaurant is legally allowed to serve food. I read the reviews, and we should have just ate somewhere else, but we took a chance. It was a Friday, and there were probably about 10 people total there (all sitting at the bar) and nobody at any of the dining tables. My family and I thought, ok well at least we will get our food quickly. It took 10 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us. After trying to entertain our 5 year old with napkins and an IPhone until our server got our drink order in a rude manner, I noticed food all over the napkin and quickly grabbed it out of my child's hand. My wife told me to calm down, but at this point I was ready to leave. The waitress then took another 10 minutes to take our order because she was too busy standing at the bar laughing with her co-workers. IT TOOK US 30 MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD after all of that. You would think a restaurant, not being busy at all and a waitress knowing her customers have children would actually make sure you get your drinks, food and bill quicker than that. My wife suggested me to talk to the manager, but I figured that there was no point because if this is the kind of restaurant they run, like a circus, what good will my complaint be?? They apparently haven't tried to fix matters due to their reviews so here is another one they can ignore. We will NOT be back! Im starting to think that they should turn it back into a bait shop like in the old days, because that is basically what they are serving."}
{"text":"The service sucks! Takes forever to get a drink and even longer to get food. I would give them negative stars if they were on here"}
{"text":"Very disappointing evening with grandkids and others tonight . There were 9 of us. Service was awful...slow, incorrect and all meals were not served at the same time. As a matter of fact two of the children were the last to be served....REALLY! Drinks were wrong. Waitress was really not interested or apologetic. Was told that the ladies room was not up to restaurant standards. My grandson , who is 11 commented on the graffiti on bathroom wall and asked for it to be removed. My husband and I were visiting in the Area and will definitely NOT be back. Place has potential but needs a change in attitude!"}
{"text":"This is not Table anymore. It is a sports bar, with bar type food. I liked Table as well but it is gone so no whining. Had the hummus appetizer, was good. Had a burger and sweet potato fries. Fries were great, burger was decent. Service was good, came before the rush. Staff dressed a little inapprotiate. Nice view on the deck for spring day."}
{"text":"This was the worst restaurant that I have ever been to. We saw the bad reviews but decided to try it anyway. The atmosphere on the lake, or dirty pond, was filthy and in disrepair. Our server was very nice. When our food arrived, it looked inedible. After trying the nachos and bloody, undercooked chicken wings, we asked for a manager. Our server said they may have left and she would see if someone was there to help us. Some person came out, and took our meals off the bill but offered no apologies. Lots of other great restaurants right next door. Trust these reviews!"}
{"text":"My family loves eating here.....love the outside patio by the lake.......portions are good and tasty. ... Friendly service"}
{"text":"I MUST BE AN IDIOT.  I went back.  I tried it again.   Are you sure this place is not some reality show?  The service is sooooo bad, it can't be real.   Ordered a bourbon and coke at  the outdoor bar.  But as she hit the gun for the coke there was a sputter of colored water.   The bartender stated she would go in side to get a coke for me.   As she left she stopped at a table where she apparently knew the people and proceeded to talk to them for 5 minutes. Then off she went to the indoor bar. As she returned she had two beers for her friends.   As she came back she looked at me and said.  \"What are you drinking again?\"  I told her and she proceeded to leave again not to be seen for another 5 minutes.   I just got up left.  NEVER AGAIN!  AND I MEAN IT THIS TIME!"}
{"text":"This is the restaurant that replaced Table Brick Oven and Bar in McMurray, PA. Wish that Table would have stayed open after eating here...  They weren't very busy and we decided to try this place after we found that Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza up the hill had a 45 minute wait. The decor is tacky. Some walls are painted like baseballs and basketballs... It looks like it should be a young boy's play room.  Our server was a young girl, most likely in high school. She was very inattentive, and spent most of her time socializing in the kitchen, which I could blatantly see. My mom ordered a burger, not hard to screw that up. They are apparently known for their grilled cheese sandwiches, but I wasn't in the mood for a cheese overload and got a Margherita pizza instead. Food took forever to get to the table. Once it did, we were disappointed.  Mom's burger was literally black and beyond well-done when she had asked for medium. My pizza was very mediocre, but it was fine. Mom sent the burger back and asked that it was taken off the check. She didn't order anything else.  The manager came over, gave us his business card, apologized, and promised that our service would be better next time. No free appetizer, no dessert on the house, just a business card.  We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Horrible service, horrible drinks, horrible foo...oh!  Wait.  We sat at the table for 2 hours and never received our food!!!  I'm not even going to waste my time writing a longer review (because On Deck probably won't even be in business by the time I finish it)."}
{"text":"I love it here.. Never ate here, seen the menu and has a great selection, but I go there to drink..Has a great atmosphere, very clean, outside bar, and an awesome DJ! I love to dance, but hate the whole Pittsburgh crowded scene.. Nice location and bartenders are very nice!"}
{"text":"I don't get why there are all of the complaints about 'it used to be Table, and now it's not.'  Seems unfair to complain that this restaurant is not the same as some other restaurant that is now out of business.   The food was pretty good. I have been here twice now and both times the food was pretty good. It's a small menu with burgers, wraps, sandwiches, salads and wings.   Had wings and burgers both times   Wings are pretty meaty and juicy.  My eating companion  had the captain (capicola egg and cheese on grilled Italian bread) he said it was a little spicy but stills good.   Had take out for co-workers  of the chicken sandwich, fried chicken breast, Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato  on a pretzel bun.  Coworker said it was excellent, bun was fresh and the chicken juicy.    Burgers are hearty and were cooked as ordered which is hard to find. Most places give you well done no matter how you ask for it to be cooked.   I came for lunch today and service was faster than when I came for dinner a few weeks ago, but we had a large party of at least 12 so slower service is a little understandable.   Help wanted signs are posted in multiple places so management knows of the issues and appear to be trying to address them.   As for in appropriate attire, this is a sports bar now and the attractive waitstaff is wearing clothes to match. But nothing you wouldn't see at any other sports bar type place. They also have male waitstaff if you don't want to look at pretty women.   I would have given another star if service would have been faster. They were pleasant but are certainly overwhelmed at the moment."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Simply put food, service and atmosphere was AWFUL.  Service was slow and sparse, food was either cold, wrong or inedible and their draft beer lines REALLY need to be cleaned. My draft had such a funky smell I didn't even drink it. Stick to bottles IF your brave enough to stop here. Be warned..."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times when it used to be \"Table\" but ever since it changed to On Deck we like it SO much more. The outdoor area is awesome and the little lake relaxes you for a little bit. They have decent vegetarian options and the food is pretty good. Service was on point even though they were busy and not too expensive. Inside is pretty dark and the bar area on the deck is also pretty nice."}
{"text":"Completely awful!   Pens game 7, scarce crowd and still waited over 10 minutes before we decided to leave.  The Manager walked by us many times without a word. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Went with girlfriends for a casual dinner. Its a shame, this venue could be great. The menu is terrible. They have no frozen drinks, even though it was 90 degrees and they have a great patio that overlooks a lake.  Too casual, looks like its run by kids. Sorry, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Poor selection of craft beer, they have like 24 taps, 12 different beers, 3 or 4 of which are craft. One is pretty much always 60 min and a light Rivertown beer. Why not get 24 different beers with that many taps. Could use a better happy hour special. Nachos during happy hour for $5 aren't bad. Service is weird. Saw a bartender shake chardonnay over ice because they had none cold. Fairly empty except on Friday and Saturday nights."}
{"text":"I just wanted to add a suggestion, but based on these reviews, it won't be around much longer! Here's the suggestion anyway: we stopped in for happy hour and found the only beer on special was the swill nobody wants anymore! They have a good beer selection, but a happy hour only on Miller/bud/coors products isn't happy, it's sad! We left."}
{"text":"Terrible service!!  The food was fair but not great and definitely not worth waiting for.  This place used to be \"Table\".  The new owners don't try very hard to get or keep customers."}
