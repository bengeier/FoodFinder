{"text":"Arctic Avenue is a little ice cream shop in what was the store building for a gas station. The pumps were removed ages ago, and what remains is a wonderful place to go for a delicious ice cream treat!! There's even a cute ice cream one sign out front, so you can't miss it!   The establishment is cash only- which isn't a problem if you know it up front.   They have tons of different ice cream products, the usual soft-serve, hot fudge sundaes, and banana splits. If you order a soft serve cone with a topping, expect to find it in the bottom of the cone too! I love having a last bite full of rainbow sprinkles myself :)   They also have their version of a DQ Blizzard, it's called a \"Freeze Out\" - which the cookie dough one is delicious, by the way. They come in a multitude of flavours, too!   I recommend stopping here when you want some tasty ice cream! And I love supporting a small business when I can!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! I always try to support the local business owners. The husband and wife are very nice. Great prices and selection."}
{"text":"Great ice cream cones with a twist! Very good prices and very friendly! Delicious and will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"A great little place for all your ice cream needs. My go to treat is usually the chocolate shake but everything else I tried was Tastey! They appear to use Turner Dairy Products so you know the ice cream is a step above what you would find elsewhere in the area."}
{"text":"Best ice cream place in North Versailles (and probably the best ice cream place I've been to). The prices are great and you really get your money's worth. Their Freeze-Outs are great (their version of a Blizzard). I usually get a children's sized milkshake, since the small is HUGE. The quality of ice cream is much higher than your regular chain ice cream places. Just remember this place is cash only. I highly recommend you go to Arctic Avenue for your ice cream craving."}
