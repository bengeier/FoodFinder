{"text":"Some of my happiest restaurant related memories are of Chef George, sitting in a booth and eating delicious food. The beef tapa is my favorite, but the pansit is also great."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and we were glad we did... The pansit was excellent, perfectly done and very tasty. It's rather small with limited seating but with the wait.  The only thing is they only take cash or debit which if you're from out of the country like me, you'll have to stop at an ATM first...."}
{"text":"This is the best Filipino Breakfast place.  I came with my parents on a Saturday morning. It wasn't too busy when we first came in but was filling up before we left.  I tried the tapa with garlic fried rice AMAZING my mom had the Daing na bangus (Fried fish) with the garlic fried rice - also AMAZING & my dad had the longonesa (filipino sausage) also really good but I found it was a small portion. I would of like more of it.  All above served with 2 eggs however you want it & tomatoes"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Definite departure from my typical greasy spoon breakfast, but food was delicious, service was great and prices very reasonable. Wish I lived nearer, I would absolutely become a regular."}
{"text":"Delicious! Went here while visiting Toronto...definitely worthwhile. Inexpensive, delicious food and great atmosphere. Would eat here again for sure :-)"}
{"text":"The place looks cozy inside. Brought my family here for late brunch. I ordered the tapa fried rice, it didn't really meet my expectations. The beef was tender but it was too sour I couldn't even eat it with tomatoes and the vinegar, which is usually the sawsawan. The food portion is generous. The lady serving us didn't seem like she wanted to work there. She was giving me a vibe that I should order eat and then leave. This place didn't meet my expectations. Tbh I would choose a different Filipino restaurant. Rating it with two stars, one for the interior design and another for the food portion."}
{"text":"I dropped by at Chef George for takeout lunch for me and a colleague. The order process went smoothly over the phone. I ordered the chicken a la king, and the smell of the food in the car was absolutely mouth watering. The food was just as delicious, and I honestly can't describe anything else that it tastes like. I love that each of the meals comes with a fair side portion of vegetables. My colleague had the pot roast beef sandwich. She fell in love with it and now she wants to get the whole staff hooked on this place. At pick up, I saw the chef preparing some amazing shaved ice desserts, topped with icecream and condensed milk - on a hot day I really wished I could take that out too.  One little hitch, is that both the Yelp phone app and Google maps told me the place is at Pharmacy and Ellesmere. The address is actually on Birchmount, just south of Ellesemere, on the east side of the road. There's plenty of parking outside the restaurant. The seating area was nicely decorated."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Chef George Breakfast & Lunch Cuisine: Filipino/Canadian Location: Scarborough Address: 1519 Birchmount Rd. Price Range: $4~10  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 4  Service: 4  Ambiance: 3.5 Overall: 4  Chef George B&L opened around the last week of February of this year after a few delays. As soon as I heard of a Filipino breakfast/lunch place opening in my area I knew I had to drop by. A few weeks after the opening I was finally able to bring my family over to check out the food. I was sick at that time too and didn't want to be anywhere but my bed, but I'm glad we came by.  For a new B&L restaurant, their menu selection is pretty extensive. We wanted to try as much of the menu as possible...we barely made a dent lol. Here's what we did order though: mozarella cheese sticks (baby sis gets what baby sis wants), lomi soup (small), luglog, supreme french toast, chicken fried rice (large) and an order of lumpiang shanghai. I can usually eat more, but sadly...I was sick :(  The mozarella sticks were ok, seems like the kind you could buy from Costco. What I loved the most was their Lomi Soup ---- oh man did I love this soup! Perfect seafood sauce that wasn't salty (unlike most lomis I've had). For a \"small\", the portion was big enough to share with 3-4 ppl as an appetizer. The meat/seafood to noodle ratio was spot on. I dream of that lomi to this day...  The pancit luglog, or palabok if you will, was also really good. Perfect with lumpiang shanghai. The portion for the luglog was also massive so be prepared to share! The shanghai are smaller than what I'm used to but the flavour of the meat was solid...no complaints. I didn't eat the french toast but baby sis said they were \"really good!\". The chicken garlic fried rice is a staple order in my family. Huge portion of rice...I just wish there was more chicken, but that's just me :P  For a guy who was sick that day and coughing up a lung...I sure ate a lot! We all did. Needless to say, we had a wonderful late lunch at Chef George and I'm looking forward to trying out the rest of the menu one day.  Sometimes pictures speak louder than words...check out the few that we took that day.  Summary: Good food, big portions, extensive menu, authentic Filipino dishes, bring an empty stomach.   Recommendations: Lomi Soup***"}
{"text":"Food here is really tasty and freshly made! Unlike the other Filipino ready-made places like FV food.. they recycle their food next day and got sick.  Anyways, I come here for brunch, I usually order the tapsilog  (tapas, eggs and rice) and pancit luglog and it was delicious! Also, portion is great and inexpensive. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chef's Breakfast Sizzler and the best part of the meal was the good tasting potatoes.  I would have liked to have more bacon and ham added to the dish.  The staff was attentive and overall a good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Pretty good place for breakfast or brunch. The beef tapas were a bit salty, I guess because of the vinegar on them, so you can ask to have less vinegar on them. Otherwise it was great meal."}
{"text":"Chef George is probably one of the best kept secrets in Scarborough.  There's really nothing else around the area but my family goes out of our way to have brunch.   Chef George serves brunch mainly.  You have you regular western style brunches - the hams, the sausages, the bacon, any style eggs, toast, French toast, crepes, etc.  I've see some people order this which is all good... but you don't come here for that.... you come here for the Filipino breakfast/brunch!!!!   They serve the traditional longsilog and tapsilog of course!  What is longsilog? We talking about LONGANISA (Filipino sausage nice and sweet and tender), SINANGAG (fried garlic rice) and ITLOG (egg, usually fried) but it together and you get LONGSILOG... same thing with tapailog except with TAPA (marinated beef).  Must tries here!   I'm not going to lie, I love other dishes too like the popular chicken adobo, palabok or luglug, even the lomi soup.   BUT the one that I can't get enough of is the SIZZLING BANGUS SISIG!!!!  OH EM GEE!!!! Greatest ever.... it's a whole milkfish belly with soya sauce, onions, hot peppers and chopped tomatoes with either egg dropped or a dallop of mayo on a sizzling plate.... one order is definitely not enough for me.... I'm almost embarrassed but I'm not.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed especially if you a fish lover!"}
{"text":"First time having Filipino brunch, found this place on yelp and it was pretty good. Seated quickly, ordered and food came within 15 minutes. We ordered the staple dishes many other helpers have already commented on. Beef tapas with garlic rice, fried eggs and tomato salad for me and hubby ordered chicken adobo with the same accompaniments. I enjoyed my meal, I pretty much drenched my rice in the coconut vinegar and it was delicious haha cleaned my plate. I would return if I'm ever craving garlic rice again!"}
{"text":"I actually went to this place because my boyfriend read some good reviews on this place. He knows I love Filipino food but didn't really venture to different places to get some good grub. We came here for brunch both times and we of course had the traditional breakfasts. He had the Longsilog and I had the Tapsilog. I really liked their Longonisa as it was juicy and not too sweet. My Tapa was nice and chewy and well flavoured but I just love adding vinegar to it! I'm salivating just thinking about it. To be honest, I always love ordering breakfast so I have yet to try their other dishes. The good thing is they also have food like hamburgers and such for those that aren't as adventurous with food. How unfortunate! They are missing out! I definitely want to go back and bring my dad and atleast try something other than breakfast heh heh."}
{"text":"We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday to get here! They're closed on Sundays which is our usual brunch time. This place would make a killing if they were open on Sunday too. That church crowd be like...!   Anywho, clean and spacious space. When you hear \"Chef\" you feel like they splashed a bit of style to the ordinary. This isn't your typical hole in the wall Filipino resto.   We knew they served Filipino breakys so of course our first go at this spot was that. I like that they served fruit skewers with my meal;  tomatoes on the side of my dish; vinegar condiment on my table; meats were made to order and not heated up when ordered.  Though because it's a \"proper \" Filipino dining spot I didn't get my achara  (pickled veggies) and garlic fried rice, and more colorfully flavoured suka  (vinegar). But if you want to introduce yourself to what a Filipino breaky tastes like this is the spot you want to give it a go! If yous a Filipino who wants to feel a little bit more classy while eating a solid meal then this is your spot.  We'll come back still and try their \"Canadian\" fare!"}
{"text":"It's my first time eating here. We came here at 7:30am and there are 6 people eating here before us. So I guess the place will get busy during lunch time. The washrooms and the place are clean. There are boxes of supplies when you walk to the washroom. The waitress is nice but needs to smile more. She is very accomodating which is great. I love the beef tapa ($8.49) but the beef is a tiny portion; it's like 1/4th of the plate and the rice & the two eggs dominate the plate. It  makes me want to ask for more beef. The large Lomi that we ordered ($10.99) was okay.. I'm not impressed because there are only small portions of \"tiny\" shrimps and it is mostly soup. There are more sliced eggs than the tiny shrimps. I didn't see any pork liver. A traditional Filipino Lomi have a pork liver. I find the lomi very commercial. I wouldn't call their lomi special. But over all it's okay. I would go back to try their lunch menu but it's too far from our house. Oh just to let you know that their lunch menu starts at 10:30am but you can request for lunch menu if they're not busy (that's what the waitress told us)."}
{"text":"I haven't found a breakfast restaurant where everything is good till now ! Eggs were soft and creamy, bacon was perfect and so was ham. I rather come here than Cora or Markham Station."}
{"text":"Good variety of price offering for value meals up to premium. Regular visit unlikely occasionally revisit definitely"}
{"text":"My sisters been raving about this restaurants for eons so I finally caved and went to Chef George for lunch.   We ordered a large chicken fried rice (boneless fried chicken with garlic fried rice $8.99), the bihon guisado (stir fry thin rice noodles with shrimp, fish balls, chicken and vegetables mixed in garlic flavoured soy sauce $8.99) and another chicken noodle dish (the name escapes me). We wanted to order a side of spring rolls but they were out that day.   Overall, the food wasn't anything special nor did it taste like anything out of the ordinary. The chicken fried rice was very basic deep fried chicken with little to no garlic flavour in the rice. The other two noodle dishes were very similar in flavour but once again, nothing to rave about.   The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant is clean and brightly lit. Unfortunately, I will not be returning. Not my type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Split the chicken adobo, beef tapa and the sweet sauce breakfast plates with a friend... Unbelievably satisfying and delicious. All our eggs were sunny and perfect as ordered."}
{"text":"Went to this place with some coworkers and had the chicken fried rice with fried egg for lunch....soooo good.  It's only open till 3pm but you get great portions of good food at this spot.  Will come back here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food here! The chicken Adobo tastes excellent with the garlic rice. Definitely tastes like like it was professionally cooked. Good service also to compliment the food"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst brunch experience I've had in Canada.   I ordered a coffee and the beef tapa with poached eggs. My coffee wasn't served for a long time, then I saw the server brought two coffees for the next table who ordered about 10 mins later than I had. So I asked for my coffee. My coffee was then served, about the same time my food arrived.   Beef was super dry, just like beef jerky. Poached eggs are overcooked, where eggyolks were solid. Honestly I have never had hard poached eggs at any restaurants in Canada (I always asked for soft poached, but even without asking, no one ever served hard poached eggs). Then the rice was cold.   Honestly this is my first time coming to this place and definitely the last time. I chose this place purely based on the overall high rating on yelp. I have no idea how this place gets such overall high rating, and was very disappointed.   I will strongly recommend people who are considering dining here can read this review and maybe have a second thought.  Even this is a big variation than most other positive reviews on yelp, I will never choose a restaurant has no quality assurance."}
{"text":"Since I normally prefer something that isn't too heavy early in the morning, I chose to forego the Philippine breakfast dishes and had the classic breakfast. This breakfast came with 2 eggs, 3 sausages (though you can choose ham or bacon), toast, home fries and a fruit skewer, which is plenty for one. I came on a weekend and ended up paying $6.99 instead of the $4.99 as stated on the menu, which was a bit annoying because nowhere on the menu or on the website did it say there is a $2 surcharge on weekends. However, the sausages were of better quality than most other breakfast joints and actually tasted like meat. Also, the home fries were well-seasoned and not greasy! I have never had restaurant home fries that didn't taste like they were deep fried and sitting under a heat lamp the entire morning, so these fries were exceptional. I don't even really like home fries but these were great. My sunny side up eggs were nicely cooked, not greasy and with an almost perfectly runny yolk. The service is friendly and attentive, and the restaurant had a nice family feel to it. Patrons are clearly locals who come here for the generous portions and food that is on-point. I'll be back to try the beef tapas, chicken adobos and breakfast sizzler for lunch."}
{"text":"Mister and Missus' go-to place for Filipino comfort food.  Price is very good for the quality and quantity. Service is fairly prompt. Not too long of a wait for the food to arrive.   Our only wish is that they are open on evenings and Sundays."}
{"text":"A quick Yelp search for Breakfast & Brunch based on my location led me to this Filipino joint.   I ordered the longanisa breakfast (sweet cured pork sausage) and my friend ordered the chicken adobo breakfast (chicken in garlic vinegar and soy sauce). I haven't had longanisa in awhile and growing up, it'd always been a comfort food of mine. Their breakfast came with two eggs any style, garlic fried rice and a tomato onion salad.   I can say Chef George stayed true to the traditional flavours and didn't really \"Canadian-ize\" the meal (though they do have some non-Filipino dishes on the menu, such as wings and pasta). They do give a generous portion of rice and for some, it might be a bit too much. I didn't find the longanisa or adobo to be too fatty or oily, which I find Filipino food can be, especially at those cafeteria-style joints.   Overall, a filling and satisfying meal (and cheap) and I'll definitely be back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Since the time they were still at Ellesmere, we always go here for breakfast and noodles. Their food is always good."}
{"text":"I was born in the Philippines, so it is a must for me to try all the Filipino restaurants in my area, right?   This place offers amazing Filipino food and great service.  Food takes quite a bit to come, but I forgot how long I waited, for when the food came, I was overcome by its deliciousness! The tapa on the tapsilog could use less vinegar, but other than that, I have no complaints.   I will be coming back for sure, I just wish they are open on Sundays as well."}
{"text":"I'm usually busy when Chef George is open, so this visit's been a long time in the making. I opted for a small lomi soup and an order of lumpia shanghai. I'd never had lomi before, so I didn't really know what to expect, besides what I could deduce from the pictures.  The lomi is described as a thick noodles with shrimp, fish balls, crab meat, diced chicken, and egg. It's served in a fairly thick broth that tastes mostly of soy sauce. While tasty, this was a fairly one dimensional dish. I did appreciate the sprinkling of fried garlic on the top though. The crab meat was also imitation, which I expected, and very mushy. I do not think I would order this again. There aren't that many noodles in this soup, but for about $5.50, it's a reasonable portion. I got mine to go, and they did not separate the noodles from the broth. I took it to church to eat, which is about a minute's drive away, but for those who might take it further, I can see some noodle bloating issues.   The lumpia shanghai, $3.50(?) for 12 mini pork-filled spring rolls, was fairly reasonable for the price. These are one to two bite rolls, and they're pretty tasty. They're served with plum sauce for dipping. Slightly overcooked, but not bad for a snack. Also very reasonably priced.  I will probably be back when I can find a time they're open and I'm free. I want to figure out why everyone likes this place so much and how they can keep the hours they do."}
{"text":"Having read good reviews about Chef George Breakfast and Lunch, I was finally able to visit for a late breakfast since I had this past Friday off from work. Their short hours and week (Tu-Sa 7.30-3pm) have prevented me from going before. It is located in a small strip plaza in a residential part of western Scarborough, and I guess serves mostly the Filipino community. It was a little dim inside, with some blinds drawn and all dark wood furniture, and can probably seat about 40 people. It wasn't too busy, although there were people coming and going regularly, and the service was pretty fast.  I had the Beef Tapa breakfast, which is eggs with thinly-sliced beef and garlic rice, with a fruit skewer on the side. The beef was very good, similar to a stir-fry but with nothing mixed-in, and the garlic rice was tasty but not too strong. The fruit was very fresh, and the coffee was very hot and a bit strong. Altogether it was an excellent meal with fairly good-sized portions, and my bill was only $12. They also have eggs and rice with either longanisa (small pork sausages) or chicken stew, a seafood soup that I saw a few people order, as well as traditional breakfasts including a breakfast sizzler plate. Lunch items include pork chops, boneless chicken, pot roast and a few noodle dishes.  Overall, a great place to go for some different breakfast choices, and I am sure to return eventually (although the hours are a bit of a problem). Also note they accept debit and cash only, no credit cards. Definitely a strong recommendation."}
{"text":"During my visit to the Scarbs, I was feeling the need for Pinoy treats.  Yelped found me Chef George.   My orders:   Chicken Fried Rice.  Let me break this dish for you.  It is a Deep Fried Chicken Cutlet laid atop a super delicious pile of Garlic Fried Rice.  Verdict:  Yum. Spag with Meat Sauce.  My Nikki loved it.  I tasted it and memories of Lollipop Spaghetti came to mind.  Verdict:  Yum.   Chef G is kicking out some tasty treats."}
{"text":"My brother and I went there for late breakfast .. food was nothing special and service was rude .. BEWARE"}
{"text":"If you want great tasting made to order filipino food, come to this place! They won't disappoint, especially their garlic fried rice and boneless fried chicken."}
{"text":"Fast service, tasty food great prices (very cheap); only issue was they only accepted cash or debit (NO credit) which was a problem for us visiting from the US ~ they did us a deal and accepted 1/1 US Dollars - still worked out to be great prices."}
{"text":"Chef George is this awesome little Filipino brunch spot.  Chef George is this filipino restaurant masked as a brunch spot in a pretty isolated area of Scarborough (not much else in the area). The restaurant is not very large but can house a small crowd if need be. Though the restaurant is disguised as a brunch place, this is a sweet place for some Filipino and they have some dishes on the menu.  I was in the mood to hate myself so I opted to go for their fried chicken garlic rice. The girlfriend didn't necessarily go any healthier, as she ordered the Big Breakfast AND French Toast w Fruit. Seriously?  Anywho, the fried chicken garlic rice is just a heaping amount of garlic fried rice with a ton of fried chicken layered on top. Yeah. It's as good as it sounds. The fried chicken is boneless strips and I love the batter. It's crisp and not at all greasy. The Big Breakfast was just that. Big. A good portion of eggs, bacon, sausage, and potatoes with toast. Nothing special about it though. Was hoping for more of a filipino twist, but remains your standard breakfast. Oh, and the French Toast? It must have been good as the girlfriend pushed her breakfast aside and absolutely dummied that toast. I feared for her life as I did not see her chew.  One thing I hate is that they are only open til 3pm everyday and closed on Sundays. Based on my work schedule, the only time I can really come is Saturday morning and afternoon. Great place for some nice grub. I'm not a big breakfast guy while my girl is. This place appeases both."}
{"text":"I'm half Filipino and have been craving Filipino food ever since I moved to Toronto a couple of years ago.  I only get it when my mom comes to visit or I go home.  I was in Scarborough and found this place on Yelp.  The pictures looked really tasty!  The place was small, and wasn't busy when my co-workers and I first arrived, but a few more groups came in afterward.  It's decorated simple, but clean.  I had the adobo chicken breakfast and the lumpiang shanghi.  Both were good - but  not as tasty as my moms :p  I preferred the lumpiang shanghi, as I found the chicken to be a tad dry.    Prices were cheap and service was good."}
{"text":"An excellent Filipino restaurant that won't break the bank. I'd say their portions are very good, and the food is very tasty. I've tried the tapsilog, longsilog and lomi and all were delicious. The place is a good size, not too small or huge. Just enough for this type of food place. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken fried rice which is fried chicken and garlic fried rice and a side order of fried eggs to mush into the rice. The chicken was deep fried and came chopped up on a huge mound of rice and was crispy, but needed some more flavor and seasoning. I ended up shaking more salt and sriracha on food than I normally do. Value-wise, the price was very reasonable for the the portion size which was way more than I could eat and I ended up being full all day and skipping dinner.   As for service, the sign at the entrance says \"wait to be seated\", but the host/hostess station is at the back behind a counter. Service can be slow depending on the crowd, but even for a half full restaurant, there was one person dedicated to FOH."}
{"text":"This place surprised me, and in a good way! Honestly, the beef tapa (fried, marinaded beef strips) here reminded me of the delicious \"tapsilog\" breakfasts I used to have in the Philippines (\"tapsilog\" meaning beef tapa, rice, and fried eggs).   We came on a Saturday morning around 8:45 AM, and it was surprisingly busy. We ordered two plates of the Tapsilog (described as beef marinated with garlic vinegar and Chef's special soy sauce), which came with garlic fried rice and a fried egg. The meat was so, so delicious. Some people might find the meat a bit tough depending on personal preference, but I found it perfectly crispy with the right about of saltiness and tang. Plus, I have a huge love affair with garlic fried rice (sometimes, I eat it by itself...), and with the beef, it was a delicious combination of flavour. Totally reminded me of my childhood!  My only minor issue is that, per plate, it was about $8.50, which I thought was a little pricey. For two people, with tax and tip, our total came to around $21.00 (no drinks). Regardless, I'd definitely come back - good quality Filipino food, and I can't wait to check out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I was heading into Scarborough from Downtown with a friend on a Saturday morning to check out a marine store.  We hadn't had breakfast and decided to Yelp a couple of local spots.  Chef George popped up and was en route so we stopped by.  Never having Filipino food in the past we left it up to the waitress to order for us and we couldn't have been happier.  The rice is flavourful and filling, the spices on the beef dish and pork sausages were wonderful and the staff were friendly and helpful. I have passed this spot on a handful of occasions in the past and now will stop instead of driving by."}
{"text":"This place is great! Good food. Good service. We had the Tiger Shrimp and Milk Fish Sinigang, Miki Bihon, Chicken Fried Rice and Sizzling Bangus Sisig. So good!"}
{"text":"What a find.  While in Toronto for a quick business visit, I was looking for a nice breakfast.  I've never had a Filipino breakfast and saw all the good reviews so I had to try it. As soon as I walked in it felt like a warm family run business, which was proven by Chef George and his wife checking to make sure my food as to my liking. I went with a Filipino standard, the marinated beef with two over-easy eggs on top of garlic rice.  Awesome!!  I only wish found this place earlier in my visit."}
{"text":"One of the few Filipino restaurants that does not have a karaoke ... and I love it!   Kidding aside, food is great. It's not greasy compared to others that we've been at. I will take this any day over any of the Restaurants in Bathurst/Wilson area as well as Cabalen/Max in Steeles/Dufferin.  I will gladly bring my friends here, Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike.  2 Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Came to this Filipino restaurant since I was looking for something a bit different in terms of breakfast food in Scarborough.  Ordered the chicken adobo, longanisa and spring rolls. Everything ordered was pretty well seasoned.  Both the chicken adobo ($8.99) and longanisa ($6.99) came with Sunnyside eggs and garlic fried rice. The dozen mini pork spring rolls ($3.99) came with a sweet and sour sauce, which gave it that extra little flavour!   Would definitely recommend to stop by if you're willing to wait a good 15-20 minutes for the food."}
{"text":"Chef George is Filipino restaurant in Scarborough. We choose this place because it came highly reviewed. Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday and I must say l they need to hire more people to work here. The man and woman that are here, as sweet as they are - they can not handle when the restaurant is full. Bringing orders to the wrong table, no beverages.  We have now been sitting here for well over 20 mins and that is after a 15 minute wait to even be greeted.   Eventually we received our drinks. Coffee was meh, but another 10 minutes after getting our drinks our food eventually came out.   Beef tapa with garlic fried rice was delicious. There is nothing that I would complain about. The beef was marinated with vinegar and garlic and then pan fried. With the dish you also got tomatoes (which is a staple for me when eating such dishes) We also grabbed a side of longanisa, which was really good - not dry and packed with flavour.  I would come here if I wasn't super hungry because then the wait wouldn't bother me. The service lost them one star but I still would definitely recommend !!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem became no secret thanks to the many enticing reviews based on their all day filipino style breakfast. Garlic rice is my weakness and for the love of it, a 30 minute drive proved it.  The combination of beef, overeasy eggs and garlicky carbs with a side of lumpia(filipino egg roll) bid farewell to my hangover.  This place was empty upon arrival but quickly filled up and the one female server was then assisted by the kitchen help as things were getting rowdy.  I'd be here every other day if I worked/lived in the area, but sadly not so I have yet to explore their menu of delightful mixes in spurts of whenever the drive becomes worth curing occasional alcohol binges.  Popular items ppl ordered: Chicken and rice and the silog dishes Oh heck! Try em' all!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Great people with fast service. Loganisa breakfast is the best!!!! Even better it comes with garlic rice!!!!! That's life. Endless amount of people coming in all the time for the great Filipino food. Can't wait till I try everything on the menu. Drooling"}
{"text":"Beef Tapa ($8.99) Thin sliced beef marinated with garlic vinegar mixed with soya sauce, comes with two fried eggs on the rice. The beef tasted good for the first few bites, but the more you eat it, it felt a bit too vinegary for my liking. The egg yolk was runny which went well with the rice and beef.   Bihon Guisado ($8.99) Stir fry thin noodles with shrimp, fish balls, chicken and vegetables mixed in garlic soya sauce. The chicken was really good! The chicken skin was super crispy which was unexpected. The thin noodles were like vermicelli. There were a lot of ingredients and not just full of noodles so that was good. Huge portion, real bang for your buck. Not to mention the dish was delicious!  Lomi Soup ($5.99 for a small) Honestly, I had no idea what this was and what I was eating, but it was tasty. It felt like a fully loaded soup with a lot of ingredients including a boiled egg, noodles vegetables, chicken, fish balls and imitation crab. The soup was thick and quite salty though.  Food is good, real bang for your buck here!"}
{"text":"Went to go grab breakfast with some friends. I ordered the beef tapa with fried eggs and garlic rice and an extra order of eggs and more garlic rice. Gotta say that the food was really good in my opinion, I was full and only cost about $12 for all of them."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Authentic Filipino food. Best in Scarborough! Only open from Tuesday to Saturdays from early morning to early afternoon. Recently moved to this new location with more seating and parking space."}
{"text":"Had the chicken adobo and side order of the longilisa.   Food: 3.5/5 the food was OK.  Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary.  Service: 3/5 It was somewhat slow on getting out orders. Maybe I was caught at a bad time.  Atmosphere: 3/5 Normal diner.   Cheers."}
