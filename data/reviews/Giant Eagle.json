{"text":"This is almost a  self serve Giant Eagle.   Out of 9 registers 4 are self check out and 0 had cashiers during my visit.   I keep trying to go back because of its location.  It is worth the extra time to go down to the 24/7 Shop N Save or Greentree road GE for the service and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Last two visits to this store have been disappointing.  My recent check out experience was unsatisfactory.  The clerk could not ring my wine purchases; she called supervisor, and something happened when they entered the wine purchase which resulted in my writing two checks--one for everything except the wine and a second for the wine.  That wasn't acceptable; the s/visor was not at all helpful.  \"mistakes happen\" I understand that;had she communicated the details rather than walking away, it would have been acceptable.  When I spoke to the manager, he apologized.  I wasn't looking for that; rather let me complete my purchase with one check.  I would suggest additional customer service training."}
{"text":"Decent Giant Eagle to cover the necessities. I would drive out of the way but don't mind shopping here if in the area."}
{"text":"Closed by 10p.m.? Are children in charge of making the hours here?  Poor Giant Eagle can't seem to get it right.  I work right across the way from this place and have shopped many times for quality product but am always flabberghasted by how every Giant Eagle manages to hit mediocrity on the nose.  Have a great deli? Awesome! but your bakery sucks. You carry the widest variety of oils and vinegars in all of Summit County? Amazing! Why is your store in constant disarray?  Yes, this Giant Eagle has a superb deli and yes it has one of the most impressive (and frankly baffling) assortments of olive oil, vinegars, and other cooking liquids I have ever seen.  But why do other parts of the store have to suffer? Is it intentional?   If you shop during normal hours and need rosewood vinegar from Tanzania (not joking), go here and get your snark on. If you want to find bathroom tissue in under 15 minutes, don't."}
{"text":"The staff at Giant Eagle - Norton Road are friendly and helpful. I have been going to this Giant Eagle for over four years and really love it.    The added benefit of this Giant Eagle over others is the new State Liquor store inside. It is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Employees of this  Giant  Eagle  can be summed up in  5 words  I DON'T GIVE A F@@k !"}
{"text":"Service and store cleanliness are leaps and bounds above Shop N Save.  Meat is good, although, just moving from FL, I'm a little spoiled in the seafood arena.    Gas perks are awesome - $2.30/gallon to fill my tank at GetGo.  It's good for up to 30 gallons, so bring a gas can and fill up the rest!"}
{"text":"We were welcomed upon our arrival to this Giant Eaglr, or as my husband calls it Big Bird, by a lovely gentleman playing violin.  It was beautiful!  We ran in here for spices only so I can't review the majority if the store. However, I found the store layout very confusing and had to ask where the spices were. Kevin, a nice young man, showed me directly to what I was looking for.  I was pleased they had a large variety of organic spices at great prices.    I opted for self check out as I only had a few things. The self check out worked well."}
{"text":"Trying to find someone competent enough to fill a beer growler here is like performing auto-fellatio. Impossible."}
{"text":"I like shopping here, great food selection.  BUT picking up dry cleaning is awful!  The ladies that work at the customer service are SO slow and they pretend not to see you."}
{"text":"Typical Giant Eagle, but with a great Sushi array. They usually have someone there to make a desired roll. The only trouble I had at this G.E. was trying to purchase alcohol with a friend that did not have his driver's license on him. It was a first."}
{"text":"I agree this place is lacking in many areas but Debbie in customer service area needs to be applauded for her can do attitude . She has helped me out on several occasions and solved many problems ."}
{"text":"The staff is not helpful for my first time visiting this giant eagle. Its hard to get too with the mall being torn down. Also the store smells like mildew. Probably won't stop here again. Also the parking lot is like a rollercoaster hill."}
{"text":"Having gown up with Kroger it's hard going to Giant Eagle now. Their produce could use some help. I sometimes go to the other Giant Eagle onWest Market and the two are very different. The other one carries some extra produce (artichokes) that this one never has it also has a better mexican food section. This Giant a Eagle has a better more up to date layout. Standing fridge/freezer cases versus the ice chest style at the other one. This one also bags your groceries for you. Pretty good Kosher section. Their meat is good though I don't love their bakery. It lacks kitchen gadgets which can be readily found at Kroger and Acme. Acme is great for higher end items, nicer cheese, hot items, organic, local and variety. But Giant Eagle is easier to shop. Fuel perks are a great perk."}
{"text":"The salad bar is the worst thing I've ever seen!!! Dried up chicken... crusty chick peas ... dried up eggs.. good god just shut it down if your not going to put nice fresh stuff on it!!"}
{"text":"This is the most unfriendly store!  None of the workers smile, offer to help or even look at the customer.  When asking where an item is, the grocery manager didn't know if they carried it and that was the end of it.  Didn't want to interrupt the personal conversation that the blonde female manager and too cashiers were having to ask a question.  Since we pay their paycheck you would think management and employees at would be friendly at least.  If you'd like a pleasant shopping experience, drive by this store and go to ShopN Save, or Trader Joes."}
{"text":"2013 Update - Draft Beer ? Still bad service... but...  I have found 1 friendly person who works the self serve check out... the rest are moody and miserable... so there is a ray of hope on that front.  Wine and Seafood selection still spotty at best... Cheese Monger is helpful and the selection is good.  Newest feature... draft beer? Buy an amber glass Growler for $3.99 and then bring it back for refills... the beer itself is mostly nationally known brands.  We are trying Blue Moon Wheat for a first try since we know we like it.  The produce folks who work the filling station have no clue what the beers are... we may have purchased a couple... but figured we would go one at a time since there was no help on the flavor to be had.  Fuel perks are the only thing that get us coming back... Seafood can be had 7 miles North and Meat can be had 4 miles South on 91 for better quality at the same or lower prices... and don't even think that this bakery is worth a mention... WAY too many better in the area."}
{"text":"Not a bad store.  Seems well stocked and staffed.  Everything was where you would expect it to be.  This place seems to be the busiest place in the plaza.    I know that when I was here I didn't have a hard time asking for help like the other reviewer had said.  Actually it was the opposite.  But each to their own.  I can't think of anything else to say about this place as it is your typical grocery store in the Pittsburgh region."}
{"text":"We stopped here to get some to-go food from the deli-type area to take to my aunt and uncle's home for a family dinner while visiting in Akron.  Someone we encountered in Akron recommended it as we had heard that the West Point Market had moved and had really gone downhill.  (Too bad.  We loved to visit WPM when we were in town.)  We picked up some Rotisserie Chickens, Brussel Sprouts, salad, an apple walnut pie, some cheese and bread and wine.  We had our family meal and everyone thought it was delicious.  We ate way more than we should have just because it was so good."}
{"text":"Wow, nice remodel job. Like Acme meets Whole Foods. Seriously, a big improvement. Exceptional craft beers too. Wolf Pup session ipa. All the way from LA, impressive . I'll be back ."}
{"text":"Can't say I'm a fan. Fuel perks are good. But, when you offer products (let's say London Broil) buy 1 get 1. And, you double the price per pound, it's really not buy 1 get 1. Deli meats are very lacking in quality."}
{"text":"The store was clean, the workers were friendly.  Nice parking lot, lots of sales.   Definitely not a place to go if you want healthy, GMO free & organic food. They don't have much of a selection & the selection they do have is way over priced.   You can go and buy monthly T passes, which is very convenient and nice."}
{"text":"Love this Giant Eagle! We live closeby in Carrick so this is the closest Giant Eagle to us. We are even closer to Shop 'n Save, but we go to Giant Eagle more often.   The hot foods are really delicious. I frequently get the fried chicken breasts ($2) and the homemade mashed potatoes with super yummy chicken gravy! This is how gravy should be, not runny and anemic!  My sister Vi loves their sushi. She usually gets the spicy California Roll. 15 pieces for only $8! You can't beat the price. And the sushi is changed daily and very fresh.  I also really love the deli. The Giant Eagle, Dietz and Watson and Isaly's deli meats (or lunch meat as we Pittsburghers call it) and cheeses are just fantastic!  This store also has a really nice seafood area.  There is plenty of parking and the 51 Carrick bus stops literally in front of the store!  PS: The hours listed on the Yelp page for this store are incorrect. The new hours are 6am to 11pm."}
{"text":"Just watch where you pick up your produce."}
{"text":"This will probably be our back-up Giant Eagle. They have a great seafood counter and produce section also."}
{"text":"Too expensive! Nasty managers!( except Bob and Mervin) Employees are not very nice!!! Blah! Non - union store! Shop the union stores!!! PLUS all the bakery stuff is made elsewhere! The only thing that is baked in house is the thumbprints! (And the baker doesn't wear gloves!!! Yuck!"}
{"text":"This Giant Eagle is way behind Parkway Center and hard to notice unless you are in the area. Unfortunately, their tough times are your savings, as they always have a selection of discounted meats and produce, as well as clearance household and grocery items. However, please check the expiration dates and the colors of the meats as I have seen some that should be tossed out and not sold.  As a previous reviewer has noted, this location heavily relies on the self checkouts and there is often only 1-2 lanes open with several people in line, which can get annoying.   Hopefully if they ever build anything where the old mall used to be, this Giant Eagle will last. However without that, I don't think it will be around much longer. There's just not enough customers here to support the store staying open."}
{"text":"One of the few things that I miss about Pittsburgh after relocating is Giant Eagle. The chain stores in Chicago, Jewel and Dominicks, cannot hold a candle to the Big Ig. This one in particular has a great selection, new products in stock before anybody else, low prices, and the wonderful incentive of saving gas money through GetGo.  I miss the Dirty Bird."}
{"text":"I hear the banjos playing.  This is where the characters from the movie \"Deliverance\" come to work and to shop.  Having been to the newest addition in the Giant Eagle portfolio, I was somewhat stymied by the fact that this store had the same name.  When I entered, I apparently went the wrong way through the entire store.  Well, who laid at the store in that bass-ackwards way it was?  No one is going to walk past the cashiers dodging all of the out-going shoppers to get to the supposed beginning of the route you are \"supposed\" to take.  Someone needs to rethink the circulation.  Then, the lack of fresh produce (read as wilted and moldy) and the lack of any true selection...well, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"It's not a Market District but it works in a pinch. Nice bakery, not great mind you. Good Latino, Italian, and seafood sections. It's small by todays supermarket standards."}
{"text":"The staff is always nice. Very accommodating. They don't have as big of a selection as other locations but it's worth going here for the friendliness. Used to shop at the moon twp giant eagle and hated the employees. They were always rude and acted like you were bothering them when you asked a question."}
{"text":"Giant eagle is the worse. They are so unbelievably expensive. I almost paid $10 for a bag of grapes. It's like $6 for an eggplant. It's just absurd to ever shop here. It's much more economic and pocket friendly to go to Aldis."}
{"text":"I have been shopping at this giant eagle for a few weeks now. It is one of the few giant eagles that still have an eagles nest that my son loves to visit. The cashiers have all been nice and pleasant and thank me when I help to bag my groceries, which I like to do anyway so things are put where I want them. My negative comment is that things are not stocked well when there is a sale. It's disappointing when I go to the store to buy an item and I cannot purchase that because it's all out. My other issue with giant eagle is when other employees are bagging my groceries. Please take your time and keep your private conversations for when there is downtime."}
{"text":"The new cafe is so weird... Unclear hours, workers don't know what's going on and a nice patio you can't take the beer they sell on draft outside. It's just awkward and I don't get why they won't make this addition a place people want to enjoy.   We got a chicken finger meal and a grilled chicken wrap. Both items were gross.... Come on Giant, you can do better than this. We want to come here and enjoy your new cafe! Don't chase us away!"}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of Giant Eagle because they have GMO produce and products"}
{"text":"This seems like a dying store at one end of a shopping mall where everything else is closed. It's depressing on the outside for sure. The inside's a little better and had all the supermarket basics, but a good portion of the staff appear rather rough around the edges.  The whole location and appearance gave me the feeling that everyday the staff is expecting the word from corporate that the store is closing today.  It's OK when you need some basics, which is exactly why I came to this store."}
{"text":"I bought some gorgeous and tasty catfish here last weekend, which Kay and I are finding all sorts of uses for that included BBQ this evening. Their produce section is still the tops as well. They also have an army of cashiers on hand so that the lines move quickly. A nicer GE would be tough to find."}
{"text":"This store is enormous and has a large following in Stow. On the weekend, every nook and cranny of the parking lot is full. The store is nice and has everything you are looking for in a large grocery store. The store also has a few challenges. They need to hire more help with packing bags. One of their Cashiers put through two duplicate transactions on my bank card.  It was over a holiday weekend and when I called to get it corrected, they transferred me to a Pittsburgh office where everyone was at a Holiday party and could not help me. The credit did not go through for a week. Since then, I always pay with cash only. They do some things really well. I still like to visit to get the Fuel Perks and the great selection of new and different products."}
{"text":"I know I said I was done giving this bakery a chance but the maple glazed donuts looked too good to pass up. But I did. In fact, I almost propped open all of the bakery case doors so that I could let the giant, nasty house flies swarm out. They were everywhere!!!! I've complained to the company before & I always get the same lame a** emailed excuse of \"We're under construction\" even though they're not. So today I finally took a really good look at how so many flies could find their way into the donuts case to discover that the door on the back of the case wasn't closed. Thank you for trying to sell consumers stale, bug infested donuts. By the way, if you look at the corners of the foyer when you first enter the store- you will discover a number of mouse traps...way to win me over! \"Is that chocolate chip muffins or mouse droppings\"?"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this Giant Eagle. I tend to go to the one in East Liberty which makes this one look like a Whole Foods.  I love the fact that the carts here dont squeak and you dont need to swap them out 2 to 3 times. Love the fact that the aisles are really wide so you aren't bumping into everybody.   I was also a big fan of their organic food selection and how organized their deli and their produce section was. Oh and they have a rather large ethnic food section (comparable to Market District!)The whole arrangement here just works. The customer service was also pretty awesome. The clerks actually knew how to pack up my tote bag and could tell you where certain items were.   If I am in this area, you can bet I will be heading here to pick up a few groceries."}
{"text":"I come from the land of Publix so imagine my disappointment when I moved here?  There is no seafood department. There is a lack of selection and cleanliness in the meat department.  They only ever have one or two  checkout lanes open plus the self checkout open.  Use the self checkout if you dare."}
{"text":"Clean location, selection was good but my cashier barely acknowledge my presence. I've worked retail for a long time, so one of my biggest peeves is when associates carry on their own conversation while ringing a customer out. The two seemed more interesting in figuring out where the one associate was supposed to be vs being polite to me. When I said hello and goodbye, I got no response. I also saw the customer before me have to say \"have a good day\" 2x before getting a response. Associates like that are why self check out lanes are the way to go."}
