{"text":"I have gone here twice with a friend for brunch. The food was amazing! The stuffed french toast was fluffy, and stuffed with mascarpone. It comes with a peanut butter sauce and bananas. I opted out of the bananas but it was a beautiful presentation as well as a great atmosphere. There are two gents who sing and remix music. It is by far one of the best places for brunch in Arizona!"}
{"text":"We went in... The hostess and owner were welcoming. The bartender was not. Communication seemed to be lacking. We ended up going around the corner to Delux which has a new Zen32 inspired sushi bar - they even have the same sushi chef (and happy hour) as they did before. Great service - Great Food!!! Interestingly enough we met up with some kids that said they had the same experience we did at Central Bistro. Who knows - maybe they'll get it together."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, very average food, crappy drinks.  The bottomless bloody marys ($15) had zero alcohol (which seems to be a theme of popular brunch spots in Phoenix...).  My omelette (veggie, $10, added sausage for $3) was dry, didn't have enough cheese, and wasn't that big.  They did have a live band, which was nice.  But save your money and go someplace better.  I was with a bunch of friends, which made it a good time, but I would not recommend this place to someone.  Maybe they're good for happy hour, but they are not a go-to spot for brunch."}
{"text":"I visited Central Bistro last night and although the food was amazing the management is nothing to be desired.  After making his rounds to several other tables, the manager came to ours and asked how dinner was.  We responded \"best meal ever\" and the gentleman made a condescending response back and walked away.  At this point I felt dismissed and totally put off.  If you are going to have management staff greet your tables the least they could have is a sense of enthusiasm for their guests.  Perhaps they are in the wrong line of work."}
{"text":"Been for happy hour and Sunday brunch.  Had a very respectable bruschetta the first and a yummy eggs benedict the second.  While everything was good, nothing really stood out and it was just a little stuffy for my taste.  A sweet outdoor patio and open windows make for a very inviting, comfortable atmosphere, and the service was excellent each time.  If you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Rodney is the best waiter ever! He served us efficiently and kept the jokes rolling. We laughed over mimosas and had a spectacular time! Rodney rocks!!"}
{"text":"Wow!  That's all I can say positive. We still love the manager.  Horrible new menu. Leave the original drunk bread recipe alone. What happened to the wonderful creative pizzas?  Gone!  No oysters. Why buy a successful business and change the menu completely!  The website still says Social Hour all day Monday. Arrived with out of town guest to discover it is no longer available. Disappointing, to say the least, about EVERYTHING. Was one of our favorite places. Not any more. We WILL NOT return"}
{"text":"First time here. Everything was delish! They even gave us sour dough bread and a decadent dessert. The iced tea was probably the best ice had anywhere, which may sound silly, but if a restaurant can't do the simple things well, why try anything else. This place does it all right."}
{"text":"First time and were excited to try it out. Food was mediocre. Chilaquiles had two lumps of cheese on them instead of spread out and were just barely warm as were the eggs. My friend ordered steak and eggs and the steak was very, very small, made the dish look empty. Other friend had to send back his fries bc they were cold. Bloody Mary was really good. Don't think we will go back...."}
{"text":"Food and service certainly good BUT the noise level is atrocious.  Sat with 2 others at a 4 top and could barely hear one another unless we yelled.  That put a damper on the evening.  Speaking of which, were the owner to put some sort of acoustic damper on the ceiling, I'd go back.  Sit outside if you actually want to speak to others at your table"}
{"text":"Its closed...too many menu changes never got a crowd to connect with the food for any length of time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great wine list, exceptional service!!   We made reservations to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had one of the best dining experience ever! Food was awesome, drunk bread was great and our pizza was on point.  Our server was extremely friendly and super helpful. I wasn't sure what kind of wine I wanted and she gave me a couple tastings until we found the right one. She was great throughout the night. The manager welcomed us with sparkling wine and kept coming back to check on us to make sure everything was good.  Food came out fast, their pumpkin cheesecake is to die for! Great ambiance and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very very disappointed!!!..Came for oysters.No more oysters!...Apparently NEW owners took it off menu..probably won't be back!!!"}
{"text":"Three of us enjoyed a lovely lunch on the patio.  Friendly staff and delicious food made for a perfect Phoenix spring meal.  We shared a wonderful artichoke appetizer, along with a delicious salad with \"espresso vinaigrette\" dressing, 2 veggie panninis, and perfectly seasoned \"skinny\"  fries.  We look forward to coming back again soon. (A bit of a long wait for the food to arrive was my only critique.)"}
{"text":"Lunch at Central Bistro today was annoying on many levels.  Firstly, the new owners have not updated the menu online so we didn't realize that it has totally changed.  The new menu has limited options and salads will cost you about $20 - expect to leave hungry as the portions are small  Service was VERY slow, each of the 4 people in my party ordered a salad and we waited for over 40 minutes to get our food and it was not crowded.  The waitress did not check in with us at all and did not act apologetic, or in any hurry to help us get out of there in a timely manner.  I'm definitely taking this restaurant out of my rotation."}
{"text":"Service needs serious work.  Service has trailed off since I was here last, or perhaps it's just the morning and afternoon shift.  Food was pretty good though."}
{"text":"Rodney was awesome- Incredibly friendly and attentive!  Steel cut oats were delicious- you definitely need to have sweet tooth if you order it. It was basically dessert for breakfast-- a scoop of ice cream wouldn't have been a terrible idea. The chiliquiles were good. The carnitias were very tender. I'm not sure if there was a separate Verde sauce or if it was just part of the pork marinade. Topping off our great experience was a first time cookie served with a sweet, vanilla milk.    The decor was beautiful and modern.  It was a nice surprise that I wasn't expecting when we pulled into a strip mall!  Taking reservations (opentable) is just another perk!"}
{"text":"First time eating there. Staff was friendly and our server Tony was terrific.  Food and dessert was great. We will rrturn."}
{"text":"Like others in the area, we waited and watched as this space developed into Central Bistro.  The atmosphere is delightful, albeit loud.  With the windows open (gotta love Phoenix this time of year!), it was glorious.  I do wonder what the sound level will be like once the windows are closed.  Food is delicious.  Service good.  One Big Problem - on 2 visits we observed bartenders prepping garnish with bare hands.  I mean, peeling an orange with juice running down his hands and arms, then slicing it up to use in drinks.  Last visit we observed a bartender putting his hand down into the olive jar, grab a handful and put them in the garnish tray.  I immediately took the olives out of my martini!  Please - to the wonderful people at Central Bistro:  Get it together before Maricopa County comes to visit."}
{"text":"The only thing worth while about this restaurant is the location. But that's not really what it should be about, especially with the kind of competition in the Biltmore/Arcadia area! I'd like to see what this place can do in 6 months to turn it around into a decent restaurant instead of a blighted eyesore.   In summary, if you want a cocktail at a place to \"be seen\" and not heard, this is literally the spot. The overall layout/design of the restaurant is not conducive to an intimate meal, it's more like a sports hall with decor from restoration hardware. I certainly would never bring clients here to dine or celebrate a special occasion because you have to shout all the time. We were seated at the worst location in the entire restaurant. Right next to the waiters computer stand where confused waiters repeatedly consulted the menu (which was stashed behind the computer) and shouted at each other about food orders. There was no privacy at all and it was really distracting.   The menu concept is actually pretty clever and if they improve the quality of their food and seriously rethink the pricing, I believe they will have long-term success in this location. First, I appreciated the fact that the menu included not only steaks and seafood but pasta, pizza and burgers as well. A great variety for a diner that may be interested in having a go-to restaurant with that much to offer. I know I was excited at the prospect! I thought that the appetizer menu could be a little more geared toward the happy hour or after-work crowd because the bar area and outdoor seating is very inviting. After seeing that menu I don't think CB would be at the top of my list for HH. And based on the food that we ordered the only item I'd consider eating again is the Cesear salad. Whoo. Way to impress me CB. Unfortunately that was the only highlight of the entire experience.   After the salad I tried the steak frites entree hoping that it would be an interesting dish for the staggering price of $24. I was greatly disappointed with the simple presentation of a grilled skirt steak and fries with (gasp) another salad? First, I was insulted by the presence of the salad after paying $9 for a salad as my first course. Really? You couldn't throw on a few veggies to make that meal a little more substantial and less like a Sizzler experience? Personally I was expecting a culinary delight since it was priced so high for a cheap cut of meat. Did you know there's a couple of steakhouses down the street where I could have thrown down an extra 10 bucks for a filet instead? It was beyond insulting but the flavor was good probably because they splurged on the butter it was topped with (let's hope it was imported or hand churned). My date ordered the special, shrimp and lobster ravioli in a cream sauce. Ew, it came out looking so unappealing I almost lost my appetite just looking at it. When he tried it he said it tasted like freezer burn, as if the ravioli came out of a package instead of homemade. We suspect it was a pre-prepared item or they have some really bad frozen seafood they are using in their \"specials\". He returned the dish for something a little more tame, the bolognese and it was ok but nothing memorable.   And the final straw was the service. Our food was rushed and our courses came out before we were finished or ready to move on. They even rushed us at the end of the meal, putting down the dessert menu as we were still eating our entree. Despite our issues with the quality of the food, our server didn't have the decency to tell the manager and have him come over to the table to discuss it. We literally walked out the door telling them we'd never come back because of the way we were treated. Oh THEN that manager hastened his step and offered to listen to us. Too little too late. Good luck and I hope nobody else has to go through that experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Where to start.  First off the atmosphere is open and bright.  Awesome wine list, great brunches and their portion sizes are HUGE.  You can totally split with someone if you are not that hungry.  I enjoy their happy hours as well, they have $1 oysters that are fantastic.  No complaints, really!  Service has always been great too.  They are a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  If you aren't willing to spend a few bucks on good food, then stay home what can I tell you :)"}
{"text":"Tried the happy hour menu.  It is limited but tasty and changes frequently. Service was mediocre.  We sat at table for 20 minutes waiting to order after getting menus.  Then we got lukewarm water, had to request ice and lemon.  The noise level is terribly loud.  The restrooms are very odd. They are unisex, extremely dark and sink is outside restroom by the kitchen in view of diners.  Awkward.  Will not try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Can't speak for dinner, have only been here for social hour and bruch. But, divine pizzas (better than Bianco), with inventive toppings like emulsified balsamic vinegar with melon and proscuitto. Great articokes when in season and a very tasty (and potent) apple martini.   Great design. Nice bar. A bit of a big city feel that makes you forget you are in Phx.    Very good stuffed french toast for brunch, but omelete was just so-so."}
{"text":"Had lunch today at central bistro. Ate at the bar and had the chicken pesto pizza. Great tasting crust. Really well made.  Very tasty. Hurley at the bar was helpful and welcoming. When he found out that I was a new customer (hadn't been there since it changed from Zen 32), I ended up with a complimentary dessert. Service is very important and anywhere that can make you feel welcome and like you are among friends gets my vote. The main thing is that the food is top notch but the great people makes a 5 star rating a no brainer. Very good central bistro!  Oh and did I mention that I'm a chef?"}
{"text":"We went here tonight for my sister's birthday dinner and the meal was amazing, I am definitely a fan of Central Bistro!  The space is beautiful inside, but I do think it is bit noisy inside, between the music playing a bit too loudly and the high ceilings, but I the food and service is excellent!  We had the Vichyssoise to start, and the cold soup on a such a hot day was just perfect.  We also had the wood fired artichoke, which was seasoned really nicely and then taken to another dimension when dipped in the aioli dipping sauce.  My sister and I both got the scallop risotto and it was AMAZING!  The scallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear on the outside, and then the risotto was filled with flavor from the bacon, corn and peas...it was a match made in heaven!  I also thought that the price was really reasonable, at just $18 for 3 large scallops and a huge portion of the risotto.  We had some key lime pie to finish the meal, and it was the perfect ending.  The food will definitely keep me coming back....I need to try their brunch sometime soon!"}
{"text":"We invited friends to join us at one of our favorite neighborhood restaurants, Central Bistro.  Unfortunately, our dinners were bland and tasteless.  The garden risotto had no flavor and was just mushy.  The mac and cheese dish was in a heavy sauce and just inedible.  The trout was dry.  The flourless chocolate cake was dry and cold, just awful.  We do not know what happened to this place?  We have enjoyed over a dozen good dining experiences, but will not return with four bad meals served at one time, plus a lousy dry piece of chocolate cake. Ugh!  The only redeeming dessert was the apple tart. We have enjoyed many meals at this establishment and am curious as to what has happened in such a short period of time.  Did the chef quit? Had we known the chef was gone that evening, we would have stopped after appetizers, that were just ok, and finished our nice bottle of wine without dinner."}
{"text":"Only one word can describe the meal that my girlfriend and I had last night at Central Bistro- Blech!!!! To begin with I had made a reservation a week ago and we got seated in the bar. In the bar area they had the doors on both sides open to the patio sitting areas. There was a wind that was blowing threw from the north and this made for a very cold experience. Many of the dinners in this part of the restaurant  had their coats on. I asked if we could please sit at a warmer table and we got moved to another bar area table that was just as cold. After a few more minutes of shivering I asked again for a warmer table and we got moved into the main dining area of the restaurant.  Our waitress seemed clueless as to what was going on in general and after we had read through the menu she asked us what we wanted for dinner. I asked if there were any specials and of course there was, she had just not told us. We ordered a few salads, the white pizza flatbread, the salmon and pasta pomodoro. I noticed that all the tables  were getting bread but not us. I found our waitress and asked if we could get some bread. Her response was \" I was not sure if you we're going to want some bread because you ordered the flatbread.\" Brilliant!!! So instead of asking us if we wanted bread with our salads she was just going to keep on wondering if we did or did not.  I had the simple greens salad and my girlfriend the roasted pear and goat cheese. My salad was tasteless but the roasted pear was quite good. I thought, hmmm maybe our dinning experience was going to start turning around. Well, I was wrong. My pasta was listless. The noodles were limp and soggy and the red sauce tasted more like tomato juice. The sauce was watery and had no taste whatsoever. Looking at the sauce I kept thinking that it had promise but nothing meshed and it was again like water.  My girlfriend was very disappointed with her salmon. She loves salmon and whenever she orders it when we go out she devours every last morsel. Half way through the main course more than half of it sat motionless and untouched on her plate. It appeared that the house bread was more appealing to her palate than the salmon. I asked her how it was and her response was that it was absolutely tasteless. She went on to say that how can a restaurant spend so much time and money on every single last detail in the design of the space (the place is gorgeous with red brick walls, glass partitions and a wine room that was beyond beautiful) but serve food that is utterly tasteless and lacks soul. I could not agree more with her assessment. With tip our bill was $110 which would have been fine if the food was fantastic but sadly it was not. Unless the food has a 180 degree turn around and the reviews improve consistently  to 4.5-5 stars I would not bother to go back. I would rather sit down at Revo a few doors down and eat beans and rice."}
{"text":"Really horrible service. This place has gone downhill. I was here a few times when it opened and it was pretty good but when I came back a few weeks ago it was like the staff and especially the manager were asleep at the wheel.  The food quality has also gone down too and the place was mostly empty on a Thursday night. The only exception is the bar scene which is quite \"the scene\" filled with old singles wearing a scent of \"over the hill desperation\"."}
{"text":"Dustin is a fantastic server & sommelier. Love the food & environment. We will be back!"}
{"text":"the place looks great, and i would go there again to have drinks. But i would never eat there food again!!!!!!! no flavor, my wife had the filet it was over cooked and the sauce taste like it came from a powder form. our server had no clue what she was doing and the chef came over to talk to us and it was clear he was drunk or on something. But they had good drinks!!"}
{"text":"Update: have been back several times for happy hour and it never fails to make us happy! Tried everything on the HH menu to our delight. They will even take a reservation for a large party."}
{"text":"The worst service I haver ever experienced. I don't need some passive aggressive hostess with too much make up to make me wait 15 min after making a reservation to be waited on by a waiter who probably did a fat line of coke before he waited on us. Seafood cioppino was tasteless and gritty from the sand from the improperly cleaned seafood. Desserts are tasteless and are amazingly dull. Try Delux it's right next door and they have sushi!"}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour tonight with some coworkers and it was really great. I love how it's so airy and modern. I had the Mac n cheese and it was delicious. My coworkers had the pesto chicken pizza and the mushroom risotto and both thought they were great. We will definitely be coming back for another happy hour."}
{"text":"We were visiting Phoenix last week and this restaurant came up with good reviews. Loved the decor and menu but it was so extremely loud, the four of us had a hard time hearing the waitress as well as ourselves which was a shame. Our waitress was wonderful and the food good, but we wouldn't go back or recommend it unless they fix the sound issue. I'm sure we are not the first people to complain about the noise level."}
{"text":"If the service was as good as the food, this place would be a 5 stars ++. Artichokes, out of this world, beet salad, genius; the veggie casserole and polenta, awesome;  tuna tartare, delicious;  and the beignets for dessert... are you serious? Addicting.  But, on a slow night, no service. Sad. No water, I poured our own wine (delicious by the way and correctly priced Saint-Emilion), no attention whatsoever. Sad. We will come back, but we will sit at the bar then, because she is great and she cares, she rocks. And we will order those artichokes again."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Was in town for a girls weekend and we considered coming here twice!! We should've because the more popular place we went to night 2 was not NEARLY as good as this one! Everything we ate was fantastic- drunk bread, burrata, bolognese. Service was awesome and great wine selection too. Conveniently located right next to the Dry Bar which was perfect for our girls weekend!"}
{"text":"Attentive waitstaff, yummy desserts. All of our pasta entrees came out on the colder side, but pretty good flavors. I love the atmosphere and colors of the place and am going to have to try again to hopefully have it knock the meal out of the park"}
{"text":"We have been to this new restaurant (Zen32 old location) twice, once for dinner on a Monday and once late on a Friday night.  Both times the restaurant was not full.  The Monday dinner was great, wonderful service with a knowledgeable server.  The artichoke appetizer was delicious as was the ravioli of the day and steak we ordered.  Dessert, the Floating Island, was something I've never had before but the creme anglais was so good I could have asked for a cup and a straw of it.  I loved the idea that they were open until 1 am, giving us a great location to go after theatre.  When we arrived on a past Friday after a show, the seating was taking place in the bar area and we were told we could sit at the bar or at a table in the bar area.  The bar was nearly full with no two seat together so we opted for a table.  We learned that the reverse happy hour was available at the bar only.  This makes no sense. The tables are 2-5 feet away from the bar yet the menu and prices are totally different between the tables and the bar in the same room.  Very silly to do this.  Service on this second visit was less prompt, less polished and less knowledgeable.  Overall, this second visit was not as good. As a new restaurant, I hope they can work out some of these kinks as they have some great selections on their menu."}
{"text":"Food is great.  Service was very slow.  I would recommend it but only if you are not in a rush for any reason."}
{"text":"We came in here for dinner awhile back... Nice looking place. Our waitress was pretty well educated on the menu & up beat & friendly. I ordered the burger, which was okay.. Nothing amazing. I wasnt really even in the mood for Italian OR French, that's why I ordered the burger. It was HUGE though. My date had the french onion soup... WOW, now that was amazing. It was delicious. I definitely  recommend that when you go. Atmosphere was a bit loud, but it was pretty packed. I don't mind the loudness but the person I was with always talks sooo quiet so I could barely hear them the whole time (lol) Prices are pricey, but whatever.  But seriously, go try the french onion soup. I just wish my burger was a little better.. That's the only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars.  The food runner & the host were friendly too. I love when staff is friendly at restaurants. It makes it so much nicer & you really feel welcomed."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch at Central Bistro.  Shelby was our server and she was very attentive and helpful.  As a gluten-free diner, you never know if you're going to end up with just a plate of greens, but Central Bistro has gluten-free pasta available upon request.  Husband and I split the Kale Mixed Salad and the Garden Pasta and both were delicious.  The Kale salad definitely rivals True Food's Tuscan Kale salad -- very tasty.  Portions are very generous - we were glad we split the items.  This is a great addition to the neighborhood and they've thought of small details like the filtered water with your choice of orange, lemon or lime...decor is modern but warm and comfortable.  We'll definitely be back to try the weekend brunch as well."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed and ripped of!! Lo and behold this restaurant's menu changed, quote un quote, \"overnight\"even though the website's extensive menu did not reflect it just hours before we arrived for a Sunday dinner with friends.  Two of the waitstaff told us, \"they just dumped this new menu on us last night. Well, they \"dumped\" it on us, too. Only a handful of dinner selections were offered and portions were quite small... but the inflated pricing was absurd. Since we had Central Bistro gift cards and a Local Dine, we thought it best to stay. WRONG!! Service was slow and of course the staff could not speak intelligently about the menu or ingredients. And when we requested bread with our Italian fare our wait person replied \"We no longer offer bread service.\" WHAAAT!!? Who ever heard of bread being unavailable for your pasta or salads? To give an example, I ordered the Gem lettuce salad, $12. I asked if I could add a protein like chicken. They did but who would have ever guessed those 5 strips of chicken would raise the price of my simple salad to .....$20.00!!!  ordered no beverages, we had one appetizer, 3 pastas and 1 salad to the tune  of $90.00!!?? Egads.  Perhaps they should display 4 $$$$ vs. 2 $$. Fortunately, as consumers, there are many other high quality and affordable restaurants in this area for us to enjoy. And BTW--if you were a fan of their breakfast menu...you'll be disappointed. More overpriced and fewer selections."}
{"text":"If you like your atmosphere so loud you have to shout at your friend sitting next to you in order for them to hear you, then I highly recommend this place.  If you like to try some place you've never been to only to be annoyed by the \"regulars\" at the bar, then I recommend this place. I went there for happy hour on a Tuesday.  Not likely to return.  Too many other places to choose from along the Camelback corridor."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to change my review.  After watching an older patron fall to the ground by sitting in a broken chair they just moved the broken chair to our table. We pointed out it should just be taken off the floor before they have a real problem and get sued.  The response was yea i saw him fall and the waiter followed in minutes with here's your check. Our food was just placed on the table.  Everyone around us at same point of meal doesn't have their check on the table so apparently that is the mgt response.  Use caution here and test your seat for safety."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go but the service was awful today. The waiter with the blue eyes seemed to be very busy with only two tables occupied. He was always somewhere else and never available when we had questions. I expect better especially when the restaurant was dead."}
{"text":"Zen 32's shoes are big ones to fill. Central Bistro does so with great ambience, service, and an incredible menu."}
{"text":"Wife and I came here for NYE 2012. Reason #1 for coming was the oysters on the half shell (for my wife). Service was great - polite, attentive and courteous - from the hostess to server to manager. Cool atmosphere, exposed brick, open kitchen. (Yeah it was in a strip mall, but this is AZ).  My wife loved the oysters. For dinner, she had fish of the moment (sea bass), and gave it a 4/5. I had chicken parm (3/5 - decent; could have used more flavor).  Cocktail menu was interesting. Mule of Thyme was tasty.  Beignets for dessert - quite nice.   Overall, an enjoyable experience. We'll come back I'm sure."}
{"text":"Excellent. Simply excellent. I came here with a large group and tried a little bit of everything.   The chicken and waffles were piled high with thick and flavorful chicken and REAL maple syrup. I also tried the breakfast sandwich and French toast. The French toast is literally a small loaf of bread. Everything this restaurant makes comes from scratch and is done to the absolute max.   The ambiance was good on a Sunday morning with very clean architecture and live music. The staff is friendly and young. My only complaint was that the sunlight was very hot shining through the windows--a cheap shade would fix that!   Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The place is great, service wonderful, the food was delicious!!!!  It's a great place to have a family dinner we will definitely come  back with our families."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for appetizers before an event. I loved the decor and the place is popular for happy hour. The service wasn't the best, which is why I had to give them 3 stars. We waited for someone to, at least, take our drink order but had to finally speak to the hostess to get some service. We didn't order drinks this time around but we did get the roasted cauliflower which was sooo good! It has cheese, nuts, and raisins (which add such a great flavor). I loved it! I wish we could've sampled more of their menu but I'll leave that for next time. It's a very lovely place with a great crowd. I will have to come back to try more food and hopefully next time the service will be better."}
{"text":"I had cocktails and drinks at the bar tonight and I must say it was an incredible experience. All of the bartenders were so informative about the new menu that they just launched and my drink was never empty. The restaurant has a great ambiance with all the glass walls that open up and the staff was very friendly. Thanks Katie, Katelyn and Ricky! We will definitely be back very soon."}
{"text":"I have only had a couple of drinks at the bar - an AMAZING bar. Dining from what I could tell looked interesting. Very modern and the menu looked inviting. Only issue is that you would be inclined to drive by it. Exterior finishing is best described as \" Nouveau Waffle House or Renegade Dennys. Horrible. If the owner had put a tenth of the effort into the exterior look/feel as they inside the place, they might actually get the casual drive bys to stop in. Otherwise in driving by it is best ignored. Too bad really in this era of new independent restaurants. Will try the food next time and update the review."}
{"text":"BEWARE! The restaurant you are reading wonderful reviews for is NOT the restaurant you will be visiting, should you choose to dine here. Be prepared to pay twice as much for completely different food that is shown on the menu here on Yelp. I honestly felt scammed, having been here several months ago and enjoying everything about the restaurant, only to return to the same restaurant under the same name, and find that everything has changed. Perhaps the new owner should reopen the restaurant with a new name. That would be the honest thing to do. The new menu is fine if you're expecting limited options of items you may not be able to pronounce, and are willing to ask plenty of questions about what is offered, and then receive a tiny portion of food for a large chunk of change. We dropped $45 for a small entree, a side, and a minuscule salad? The food we received was mediocre overall, with poor value for the price paid. The service we received was mediocre as well. Needless to say, we won't be going back. The new owner should make an ethical decision to be open with the public about the complete changes that have been made. The previous reviews and menus should really be removed from Yelp."}
{"text":"Alright first things first: The service is phenomenal. The hostess was sweet and looked back twice to make sure we were following her. The server was hilarious (her name was Julia?) and she was spot-on the entire time. I noticed another server who was meticulously polishing silverware, flattening out napkins and folding them perfectly, and carefully setting his table as if it were for his very own wedding banquet. I rarely see this kind of attention to detail.  The restaurant is extremely clean. I was also impressed when the servers come around with a tray of sliced limes, lemons and oranges for our water and iced tea. Very impressed!  The food is a bit of a letdown. The thin crust pizza was surprisingly flabby. I mean, isn't thin crust pizza supposed to be crispy? The chicken Parmesan was burned. Why oh why put a pile of arugula on it and leave the sauce on the side? Fail.   I'll be back, I suppose, but there's dozens of other restaurants to try out lol  Come here for the service. Keep your expectations low on the food so that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch ruined by the wait staff. We walked out before a single item was delivered to us. The waitress was extremely rude, and made us feel uncomfortable. I could not justify giving them a single dollar"}
{"text":"Food;  One of the main reasons I come to Central Bistro is for the food. It's consistently fresh, and made to order ( or the way they do it makes me feel that way) I like the way they integrate their world view of food harmoniously in unexpected and interesting ways while maintaining a strong Italian vibe.  Service; The service is fantastic. All of the staff is friendly and welcoming and I always feel like a family member when I dine there.  Location; This great location is across from the Gelato Spot, in the Safeway plaza at 32nd street and Camelback. It is a must for anyone visiting arcadia for lunch, dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"We had been anxiously awaiting the opening of what we thought would be an Italian restaurant headed up by Chef Matt Carter.  We checked out the menu on line only to find it is basically French.  Service was great, including the little guy who went around offering different lemons and limes for your water.  Our waitress was exremely knowledgeable about the dishes, so great service.  Two managers even stopped over after dinner to make sure we liked everything.  Very impressive; they aim to please.  We first ordered the ahi and avocado stack and the grilled artichoke and should have stopped there.    My husband had a shrimp dish with risotto and sauteed peppers.  These 3 shrimp were HUGE  -  the Elvis of shrimp - and while we were informed they had to be peeled, the peeling was really difficult and turned into a wrestling match.  I ordered the gorgonzola and fig pizza, covered in arugula.  Gorgonzola is a kick-butt cheese and I barely tasted it, and half way through I tasted a fig, at which point I reminded myself the best pizza is at The Big Orange or The Parlour.    The location is so perfect for us I'm sure we will return to repeat those appetizers and maybe try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is just not very good at all.   The place is incredibly loud for one.  It's a nightmare for me being deaf in one ear. I can't hear a thing in there, and I've tried sitting in three separate places in the restaurant.  The portions are really small, the pasta is really big and doughy, and in three meals I have yet to be impressed."}
{"text":"Service was great and didn't have to wait long. The food was good but was hoping for better."}
{"text":"I swear that people are writing bad reviews on here so that you don't know how awesome Central Bistro is.  We went late on Saturday afternoon to a vibrant but not grossly crowded restaurant - and sat at the bar.  The dining rooms, patios and bar area are all decorated nicely and comfortably.  Even the floors are cool.  You can just tell that the neighborhood crowd has been dying for this place to open.  The bartender waitstaff: A-girl and M-guy, are totally friendly and awesome.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap and wines by the glass and bottle, and just bust their humps to serve everyone perfectly.    Here's a review on the food we tried:  APPETIZERS: Escargot - amazing and unique.  Totally delicious (I'm a regular snail eater). Blue Cheese Tart - delicious, but not huge.  That's alright.  I'm just letting you know in case you decide to only order that. Frites (fries) - fantastic, seasoned, and they come with shaved meat on them.  Holy Braseola! :)  FOOD: Duck three ways - the shaved duck looks weird, but is delightfully tender and tasty.  This is not a filling dish, so know that going into it.  It's not tiny, but don't expect a warm \"meal\".  The other two ways are a \"duck sausage\", if you will, and a beautifully rich pate.  Yummers. Seafood Risotto - I will be back for this asap.  Very saffrony, not too wet and not too dry, and the seafood was all cooked perfectly (I am picky about that).  Comes with 2 shrimp, 2 scallops, oysters, clams (but not too many, which I appreciate), etc.   Wonderful!  DESSERTS: A show-off guy next to us decided to buy four desserts for all of us to share.  Well, alright.   S'MORES:  Very rich looking; served like a sundae.  I didn't have any, but each person who tried it was a mess.  They had marshmallow and stickiness everywhere. (RASPBERRY) SORBET: Hands down everyone's favorite.  A generous serving, and every bite was not-too-sweet flavorful.   FLOATING ISLAND: I do not recommend the floating island.  It's just not something that you would expect from a restaurant.  It's very \"pretend food\" ish.  Yuck.  Sorry, but all four of us thought that.  I'm still not sure what it is. BEIGNETS: Plain on their own, but cooked well.  Served with three \"sauces\" (chocolate, caramel, and something white).  I'm more of a \"honey\" girl, but that's just me.  If you're a beignet fan, I don't think these will disappoint.  We will back soon.  The staff was amazing.  The place is going to be popular.  I love the vibe and the food.  Again, it's very neighborhood comfortable.  I love!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for foodies. Everything is extremely well carried out. The grilled artichoke appetizer is a must. Great smoky flavor and just the right amount of seasoning. Extremely flavorful. The menu ranges from lower priced burgers/sandwiches to higher end steak/fish entrees. If you're looking for great seafood, don't expect it in Phoenix. It's going to be frozen. Service was over the top excellent. We'll definitely be back to celebrate with friends in the near future."}
{"text":"Central Bistro has a very nice atmosphere.  We went for a girls lunch and I had the pizza with blue cheese, arugula, fig and prosciutto.  The other two got the soup of the day and the chicken salad and the arugula salad.  They both enjoyed their meals.  The portions were very generous for lunch portions.  Bring your wallet it is a pricey lunch.  Would like to come back and try dinner sometime."}
{"text":"I must admit, I was sad when Zen 32 closed their doors and when driving by, baffled at why this new place chose to close in the awesome patio that Zen had.  I finally walked in to try the new place out that took over the old Zen spot this past Friday night.   Oh.My.Goodness.   What an amazing replacement.  The ambiance is wonderful and even though they closed the patio in, it still feels wide open with all of the large windows and patio space they did leave.  It flows superbly.  The decor is comforting and well done.  I really liked that they had an open kitchen concept except closed in with glass walls.  We met another couple for dinner and we all ordered something different.  I got the wild mushroom pasta, my husband got the \"duck l'orange,\" one friend the sea bass, and the other steak.  We all tried every meal and I have to say that they all were cooked to perfection and soooo tasty.  I personally liked mine the best but I would have been happy if I had ordered any of the four dishes.  For duck, they really did it right.  Not greasy at all.  My husband did say he wished it came with less risotto and some grilled veggies in its place, but he still devoured it.  The bite of sea bass and steak I had melted in my mouth.  I don't know who our server was but he was awesome as well.  Very friendly, polite, and knowledgeable.  Once he realized we liked craft beer (especially local favorite Four Peaks) he asked if we were going to Oktoberfest hosted by Four Peaks next weekend and we had a brief convo about it.  Taller male, I think wore glasses?  Sorry I didn't catch his name because he was really good.  My only criticism would be that they didn't have enough Four Peaks beer on draft, but, in all fairness- that's me being a beer snob in a place that carries more wine than beer to begin with.  Luckily, I was with a wine expert and just let him order my wine so that was awesome as well.  :). Great new place.  I really keep thinking about the flavors in my mushroom pasta and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. First time there on Monday and cannot wait to go back. I'm dreaming about the pardon pepper small plate. So amazing.  Pros: 1. Awesome atmosphere and vibe for all ages from kids to adults 2. Cool bathroom - after I figured out how to get back there and was assured that I wasn't going the wrong way and barging into the kitchen 3. Amazing food. The padron peppers were so perfect; sweet, spicy, soft, crispy with the aioli dipping sauce. The skirt steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly and the french fries are very tasty. I don't even like salad and the side salad that came with the entree, I couldn't stop eating.   Cons: 1. Grapefruit margarita. It was good, but nothing stellar. It didn't taste much like grapefruit or like a margarita so I was disappointed because I wanted both and got neither.  Will definitely return and try some other items and a different cocktail or two next time."}
{"text":"I frequent here about 2-3 times per week and I'm obviously a fan:) I love the customer services and relaxed open atmosphere. Brunch and dinner are both great. Happy Hour is a must try with a variety of food choice and drinks and very reasonable prices. They began a new menu this past Monday that I'm really looking forward to try and they've kept some great item from their previous menu as well. There is a dining area and also a bar area. It's great for a happy hour crowd and also a families. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"We walked in at 7 on a Friday night and was asked if we had a reservation.  No... or we would have said hi we have a reservation...  The restaurant looked half full but the bar was full.  We were told a 10 min wait which seemed odd as my boyfriend counted 13 open tables.  That many reservations???  We waited about 10 min and were seated at a table next to one that was empty next to the wall.  My boyfriend asked the host if we could have that one and he said he thought it was reserved... Ok whatever...  We took a look at the menu and it wasn't anything like what I saw online.  Maybe the menu is different on weekend nights.  My boyfriend was annoyed by the service and was totally turned off by the menu.  And he wanted to go.  So this maybe an unfair review as we didn't even try the food.  Service is very important to us and it seemed like the individual who sat us would rather be somewhere else.  It worked out well for us because we went to Base up the street and had excellent service and a great meal."}
{"text":"Very good addition to the neighborhood.  The decor is great. The bar is comfortable and open, perfect setting to wait or just to hang out.  I had the watermelon feta salad which was unexpectedly great. The pickled onions were tasteful and the presentation is wonderful. Once in a while the mint flavor kicked in to boost the taste of the salad. If you order it, I would recommend to order it easy on the onions, unless you want to be single for the rest of your life (just saying).  The mushroom pasta was also pretty good.  No complaints at all about the service and the price was pretty fair.   The wine by the glass from Oregon (pinot noir) was pretty good.  We were celebrating a birthday and the party was pretty big, so we ended up sitting in 3 different tables. I don't know if they have a private dinning room but if you have a big party and want to be all together, this might not be the right place. In our case, we had a wonderful time and the 3 table deal worked just fine.  Highly recommended.  Cheers"}
{"text":"Central Bistro deserves two stars just for the fantastic remodel of a former sushi spot in a local strip mall, the build-out completely transformed the nondescript generic space into a red brick and white picket fence arcadian version of fine dining. The food however was so ridiculously bad, it was like some kind of Saturday Night Live parody. I was taken here for my birthday and it was unfortunately the worst culinary experience I have had since moving to Phoenix - excluding the post meal gelato at the always phenomenal Gelato Spot. The service at CB was like watching a middle school play, so many mistakes but in the end, you are just relieved that it is over...The reservation was lost, we were given a table in the bar instead of the dining room, after being seated a third time, we had to ask for the complementary bread twice (albeit the most delicious part of the meal) that every table around us was enjoying, and finally the food was delivered at once, overcooked and almost inedible, salmon with sad unidentifiable veggies, salad limp and deeply saturated with dressing, some kind of pizza with blackened overdone dough, served stiff, uncut, and as appetizing as, well, eating cardboard...I will be back but only after the kitchen has untangled the kinks, I can think of many other local places to actually enjoy the experience of dropping a hundred dollars for a meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! The servers are all friendly and attentive. The food and drinks are yummy. Its our favorite place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and recommended by friends from back in wa state  to stop in...  We were so glad we did! Everything from the moment we walked in worked wonderfully. Our waitress was phenomenal and sweet  with our kids. The food was EXCELLENT , prices very fair and atmosphere was perfect. You guys need to go. Seriously, you live here. Go. I want one back home Washington!!!! Thanks for a great night CB!"}
{"text":"Central Bistro, I think I'll pass next time.  This place is OK, nothing special.  I'm a huge fan of breakfast joints, so i wanted to venture out from my normal breakfast places.  So I heard about Central Bistro, so  I wanted to give it a try.  I invited my future in-laws out for brunch today.  We made reservation at 10:00 and were seat right away.  Funny thing is, my fiance requested to sit in one of the empty booths that were surrounding the restaurant, but our host said they are were all reserved.  My fiance said all of them? and she said. Yes.  By the way, after we finished our meal, ALL the booths remained empty.  Anyways, like I said it's all about the food.  I felt the meals were really overpriced and the food completely didn't deliver.  We ordered the fried chicken and waffle, Chiliquiles, Prosciutto Benedict, and standard breakfast.  The dishes were very average.  I felt the fried chicken was over fried and the waffle was bland.  The sausage gravy was lumpy and the eggs were overcooked.  My in-laws didn't eat much of their dishes, so I know they weren't that impressed.  The chiliquiles were a disgrace to the dish it tried to resemble.  In normal chiliquiles the tortilla chips should be cooked down with some sauce, but these were not.  It felt like you were eating nachos with green chili on top.  Not impressive at all. The service on the other hand was pretty decent.  I can't remember the lady's name, but she did a really good job.  Kept up with all the refills, and checked up on us from time to time.  For that,  I would step up and give it 3 stars, but honestly, the food was disappointing and there are a lot of really other good breakfast joints I would rather eat at.....It's a beautiful restaurant with disappointing food, but decent service, that's how I would sum up this place.  I would not recommend this place for breakfast, I may try their lunch or dinner, but never again for brunch."}
{"text":"I really really enjoy this place!! But, I'm going to agree with a few other folks on 1 issue... Why is the music so damn loud in the bar?? Anyway, drinks are tasty and I love their \"Social Hour\" from 2-6 pm. Will definitely be going back to this place!"}
{"text":"I'll cut to the chase. My wife and I have a 2nd home in PHX and Chicago is our primary residence. As an aside, we also do restaurant reviews for a private corporation in Chicago - going on 12 years now. Last night we had an older server named Andy and we were celebrating a special occasion, which we had informed Open Table when we made reservations as well as Andy in a subtle way when we sat down. After the entree dishware was cleared, we told him we opted not to have dessert; he brought the bill presentment wallet and said oh, by the way we have a special \"celebratory\" dessert on its way! Filled with anticipation, Andy then comes by a few minutes later with a coffee cup filled with milk and two (2) Chips Ahoy cookies on a saucer! Yes, you heard me correctly. SERIOUSLY? DRAW YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is like a love affair. First I just dig it. Then I can't live with ya.   My girlfriends and I had a day of atonement (don't judge me) on MLK Day. There was this smoking hot bartender....\"Earley\"(?)..... I don't remember because I was blinded by his....everything.   Any-who he provided wonderful, attentive service and was such a gentleman despite the three of us ogling him.  Social Hour ROCKS. $1 oysters (East or West, your choice) that you can order in 1/2 dozen or a dozen.  We had a blast and Chris thoughtfully accommodated us during dessert. He was so amazing, professional and made certain that we got only the best CB had to offer.   Tonight I went back for dinner (my love affair continues, right?) and I had the distinct pleasure of having the Spicy Spaghetti w/crab. I almost cried. Sooooo delicious. This dish is a MUST.    And to my delight, Chris stopped by the table to say hello. I love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Some people say brunch is just an excuse to get drunk in the mornings, some people just call that mornings, but either way with unlimited mimosas and blody marys for $15, you'll get the job done.  This place is beautiful - large windows that let in loads of natural light, exposed brick everywhere, hardwood floors, and white marble table tops make you feel like you're in a designer's home. Also, I've never had to wait more than a minute to get a table - which is a huge plus when you're hangry for brunch and mimosas without bottoms.  The food is a modern take on French and Italian flair. My friends ordered eggs benedict (there is an option for a benedict trio where you can try three of their four delicious eggs benedict options for $15). The eggs were perfectly cooked and the prosciutto and oven dried tomatoes played very well together. I landed on the steak and eggs. The steak was wood grilled skirt steak. It was delicious, my only qualm was that I should have ordered it rare instead of medium rare as it came back barely pink in the middle. Despite that, it wasn't dry and it still had tons of flavor.  The best food part of our brunch experience by far was the stuffed french toast. It was brioche stuffed with sweet cream Mascarpone, topped with bananas and drizzled in peanut butter maple syrup. There were literally bricks of toast stacked on top of each other, as wide as they were tall. If you're in the market to build a house out of delicious french toast confections, in a convoluted plot to trap and eat two German kids, and also you're a cannibalistic witch living deep in the forest - this is definitely where you're going to want to get your construction supplies."}
{"text":"Not only are the Managers and staff some of the friendliest, knowledgeable and amazing people... the food totally rocks! My family and I have had so many entrees side dishes, appetizers, salads, etc from the menu as well as brunch (chicken and waffles, yum!!! stuffed french toast, MORE YUM!!) We have not eaten anything here that we didn't love. Food is always fresh and the flavors are uncanny. We even had our engagement party here back in November and our friends and family loved the atmosphere, the staff and most importantly the food!  Love this place, one of our neighborhood favorites and highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I had the sea bass with chorizo and red sauce and it was fantastic. We also had the black linguine with shrimp and it was cooked perfectly and delicious. Great ambiance with open window walls, red brick and Edison lamps. Love it"}
{"text":"This place lived up to all my expectations! I came with a group for lunch and we started off with two orders of the Drunken Bread. It was excellent but definitely rich because of the swiss fondue.   I ordered the Ariabatta pasta,  which was excellent! It was definitely spicy but I was expecting that going in,  but I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone who doesn't like a medium amount of heat.   Service and decor was spot on. Looking forward to trying it for dinner!"}
{"text":"We were very satisfied with our food. My dad hates cheese and was happy that they don't put cheese on anything automatically. The burger was great and they split it on two plates so we could share. Nice ambiance and mood lighting. I wouldn't say it is 2 $, I would say it is 3 $. Most dishes over $15."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Nice wine list. There was four of us, we all shared appetizers and entrees, we enjoyed every one of them, and the prices similar with competition in the area. Wait staff warm and attentive.  I believe the owner, Tom, was in the restaurant at the time, he was fun and surprised us with dessert that we really enjoyed and again shared (the beignets with sweet ricotta, chocolate, and carmel dipping sauce). Yummy!! Over all we had a great 1st experience.  The couple we were with had dined there several times before and raved about their experience and food."}
{"text":"I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food."}
{"text":"This group of restaurants rarely donate to local schools, charities etc, so I rarely visit it, but I visit when it is convenient to my friends.  This restaurant has pricey good food, but they always treat me strangely when I am there.  It's like if you are not a regular, you are disposable.  When I spend that kind of money, I don't want to be rushed by server b/c it is 10 p.m.   I also want the last piece or prosciutto on the board-- so stop trying to bus it every four minutes."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service!!!   I made a reservation for a party of four on Valentine's days and at no given time was I notified that there was going bed a\"set menu\" for this night. Not even in the confirmation email that they sent to me, did it states this.   On the email that I received (and can make public is anyone is interested) there is a link to the menu and it shows you there \"entire menu\". Which would easily lead you to believe that they will have the whole menu available on this night, just like any other night. I get a call 3 hours before my reservation, asking if I am OK with a set menu at $65.00 a person?  This of course is after I already made my reservations and had invited guest to the place.   Is this acceptable? No warning of only a set menu?  Telling me on how I must spend my money? And not allowing me to order what I want?  This shows a lack of consideration for the gust and that they are willing to do what ever it takes to steal from their customers! I spoke with the receptionist and she claimed that  they just made the decision of a set menu and it was causing allot of confusion with the guest, so I asked to speak with  Paul (the general manager) who took forever to get to the phone. I tell Paul that I had invited guest and did not know if they had any dietary restrictions and if the limited menu would suffice there needs. He tells me that they came to this decision some time ago. My girlfriend spoke Chris (a manager she respects) on Thursday and but even then, Chris did not mention that they would be limited to a set menu.  Now we have a company who cannot get their story straight. Does this sound like a \"Great dinning\" experience to you?  My advice to you is that you should be prepared to leave this place \"unhappy\"! The food may need good, but the people running this place do not care about the paitriants and are just out to take your money any way they can."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant a 1 star because of the manager. He was awful. Does not enemies think about guest experience. Food here is good. Service is ok but management is awful."}
{"text":"What a gracious host for our Yelp Elite Event! The food and drinks here were WAY above what I expected, nicely done! I started the night out with a play on a Moscow Mule, but with strawberries and Thyme. How have I never thought to do that? Brilliant! For the event, we had a humongous seafood tower with perfectly cooked seafood, awesome risotto station and a large charcuterie table with all the fixins. They were also walking around handing out small plates such as beef wellington, french onion soup and several types of Ceviche and Tartare, all were fantastic! I'm excited to come back as the menu looked terrific and they have bottomless bloody mary's for $15 on the weekend . yessssss!"}
{"text":"What a snake-like way to use regular customers and Yelp reviewers to come into your restaurant- don't change the menu or photos on Yelp to reflect the change in management and complete menu makeover!  We had never been here, but I remembered everything I'd heard and didn't think to check Yelp before coming tonight. Got here and the waiter informed us that the owners are new, menu totally changed and previous specials nonexistent... Shady business practice"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to post this, but perhaps the new owners will bring back some of the prior faves that made this place such a great destination. (Unless they were forced to get rid of some classics as part of the sale terms?) Recent social hour brought disappointment after disappointment. The drunk bread has been taken over by a bland aunt and has lost all of its appeal. Strangely, our server talked about the change as though the new chef has actual cred and the drunk is so much better now. It's not. We left our pizzas to get thrown away after a few bites. We'll probably try brunch one time, because we probably won't have to wait since this change."}
{"text":"We held a mixer there last night and can say that the service, all the way around, was great!  The service staff ensured that everyone was taken care of.   Everyone was friendly, service was fast, and food was awesome.  We look forward to hosting an event again there next month."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Central Bistro for brunch/breakfast on Saturday. However, I was extremely disappointed.   Things started well, the hostess was very friendly and brought us waters right after she sat us. Immediately after, a server ( a girl with short hair) came by and offered citrus for our waters and then took our drink order. Soon after a different server came by and asked for our drink order which leads me to believe that there wasn't any communication.  The actual server whose name I don't remember, (some tall white guy with pouffy hair) went over about 6 things that he likes on the menu. My advice would be: pick two that are not similar, don't start listing off the menu. I ordered the 3 pigs omelet with the potatoes on the side and my boyfriend ordered a breakfast pizza with an over easy egg on top. I was so excited to try the omelet because the menu said it had fontina cheese (which is my favorite).   Begin disappointment when the food comes out. My potatoes were kinda hard/chewy which leads me to believe that they were from the day before but they just re tossed them to heat them up. My omelet was just a glorified burrito only instead of a tortilla it was egg and the inside had some meat and a little bit of cheese. When I mean a little you couldn't even taste the cheese (the main reason I picked the dish). To even connect the eggs to a tortilla the eggs were over cooked and kinda dry, you could see it was browned in some places. Omelets are supposed to be fluffy and the insides are supposed to stay inside. I almost think that they precook the eggs first then once it is ordered they put the add-ins. My boyfriends breakfast pizza was literally just a pizza with sausage and an over easy egg on top which shouldn't had been something to mess up. Well, the egg came out over hard, the server was able to take the egg back and bring an egg with a yolk that runs. I understand that some restaurants have moments where they over cook the eggs but it seemed to be a trend here because the table near us had to send his eggs back twice.   The overall experience was very low. We barely saw our server who has to be new to the food industry because he barely smiled and carried a pompous quality that was not welcoming although it wasn't too much of an issue because he barely touched back at the table. The runner/buser seemed more friendly than our server. Do not plan on ever returning."}
{"text":"I have been watching the build-out of this restaurant over the past few months and was ecstatic to hear when they announced their opening to the public.  Lucky for me, \"plan A\" turned in to \"plan 2.0\"' and I had the pleasure of dining at the recently opened Central Bistro last week.  Boy was I stoked to try this place out!!  As we walked up I got excited because I could feel the energy bouncing off the brick and mortar!  Upon entering the bistro I couldn't help but look around, eyes wide open like a kid in a candy shop.  People waiting for tables, congregating around the bar sharing laughs over cocktails....good vibes all around.  We made our way to the host area where we were kindly greeted and asked if we had a reservation for that evening.   We did and were promptly seated at a table in the bar area.    It didn't take long before water service arrived and our waiter greeted us, and ran us through their menu naming off some his personal favorites and the chef's features that evening.  We needed some time to digest the menu so off our waiter went to grab us some cocktails.  We took his suggestion on the 'Drunk Bread' and I was more than satisfied with this small plate.  It was heavenly and savory  - combining Swiss Fondue, White Wine and Day Old Crusty Bread (add Prosciutto if you'd like), and it arrived hot and ready to eat in a skillet fit perfectly for this delectable small plate.  Deciding to incorporate some greens we selected the Central Chopped salad to split before making the most difficult decision that evening - what to order for dinner.  The Chopped was good, but nothing to write home about.  Plates cleared and we were set for dinner.  I wanted mushrooms and he wanted fish.  I didn't want an entire entree and neither did he, so....we decided on the Wild Mushroom pasta and added Seared Salmon atop the Tagliatelle, Forest Mushrooms, and White Wine Truffled Cream Sauce pasta!  Probably not a common request, but the pasta dish was creamy and filled with mushrooms while the salmon was perfectly seared and delish.  At this point the check would have been a good option, but how could I pass on my favorite course, dessert!!!  With our table cleared the waiter returned with dessert menu in hand.  He highly suggested the S'MORES dessert (who can resist House-made marshmallow, chocolate-espresso pot de crème + graham cracker crumb chunks- ummmmm no one).  I was all in, that is, until he replied, \"I think we sold out of it already.\"   WHAT?  How did this happen?  You sold me on the best dessert only to tell me I can' t have it.  I was disappointed to say the least, but I understand it's a new restaurant and they're still working out the kinks.  Going with what we, err he, believed to be the second best option for dessert we decided (rather settled) on the CRÉME BRULEE and added a side of the gelato flavor of the evening (thankfully it was chocolate and I got my \"fix\").     PROS:  open for lunch and dinner, HH daily, reservations accepted, 250+ wine selection, ambiance, outdoor seating, TVs in bar, open late night (until 1am most nights), extensive menu (small plates, soup/salad, pasta, pizza, risotto, land, sea, air, and sides...dessert, espresso, and specialty after dinner drinks and cocktails  CONS: depending on where you sit it can be a little loud (and while I don't mind, I'm aware others do)  For having only been open a short time, I would recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family.  The restaurant is lively and offers an array of modern French and Italian fare.  Still undecided? ....make a reservation and check it out for yourself.  It'll be a local hot spot and I wish the new kid on the block much success.    Welcome to the neighborhood, Central Bistro."}
{"text":"Spent our New Years Eve with Central Bistro.  The service was the worst we have had in years, waiter not only rude, not knowledgable about what was on the menu. Will never go back or to any other concept by this company."}
{"text":"We have been in several times and our experience is always excellent. It's on our go-to list* of places for special occasions - but we often come in just because as well.   I have never ordered something that wasn't great. Not just good - actually great.  The service has always been very good.   What prompted this long overdue review was our last visit: This last Sunday my mother and I were in for brunch after doing some wedding planning and attending a bridal show. Our server, Marius, made our day even more fun! He was so friendly, knowledgable about the menu and FUNNY!  Thank you, Marius. You made our brunch extra fun! and thanks to all the peeps at CB - see you soon!    * This is our short list so if you liked CB you might want to try out: - Ocean Prime at City North ($$$) - Bourbon Steak at The Fairmont Princess Hotel ($$$$) - Olive Garden ($) I know it doesn't really fit in with this list but it's great to pop in for soup and salad! - Arrowhead Grill in Glendale ($$)"}
{"text":"Had a great experience with awesome service for a birthday dinner! Thank you Central Bistro!"}
{"text":"From decor to dessert this restaurant is firing on all cylinders.  Food was great and Sam our server and Brittani the GM made our first brunch experience unforgettable.   We tried the 3 pigs omelette which can only be compared to a molten cheese, and bacon filled cloud.  The California breakfast sandwich complete with roasted fingerling potatoes that is second to no breakfast sandwich.    Also, bottomless mimosas that are reason enough to spend both brunches of your weekend there.  Get in here!"}
{"text":"Came here for impromptu breakfast this morning, and I think it's my new favorite spot!  To the restaurant owner/manager: our waiter was the best! I wish I would have gotten his name, but he's tall, thin, kind of long blonde hair, very chill personality. At the end of our meal he asked my boyfriend and I if we had ever been in. We said no, and he said \"ok\" and just walked away. We thought it was a tad strange, but 5 minutes later he came over with a free dessert for us to share! It was the caramel flan, and it was sinful. He was so sweet and genuinely excited that we liked the dessert, and his attitude made me want to come back here every Sunday just to have him as our waiter!  My waffle was good but pretty standard, which I'm a big fan of. But the best part of their menu is the breakfast pizzas! My boyfriend got the sausage option, and he ate the entire thing! Keep in mind it's the size of an actual pizza. I took my life into my own hands by going in for a taste, and let me tell you that almost getting my hand bitten off in the process was worth it (sorry babe). It was definitely good.  I can't wait until the weather gets a little cooler so we can walk here on a weekly basis for good breakfast, quaint atmosphere, and friendly faces!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my wife and child last night around 6-630.  The bar area was pretty crowded with what seemed some nice business people and some bar regulars.   We wanted to sit there as the noise level was good enough to muffle a two-year-olds noise.  Anyway the server Kelly was great, she seemed to have a busy section/restaurant but was in constant sight and was always floating/scanning the floor.  I must also mention that the busboy and runners were very professional and polite every time we saw them.  We had a Barolo - delicious.  The house peppers were good - but prolly wouldnt do them again.  Ceasar was way way salty.   I had the Pork Marsala with egg noodles - really good flavor in the sauce and I wanted more egg noodles!  The clam bake was so so.  It had great flavor but was so hot!  The sausage in it was delicious as well.  (I have been here before and the Steak Frites are definitely worth noting)  Dessert was spot on - i hate tarts and meringues - but the Lemon Bar was awesome as was the Bread Pudding.    Did I mention Kids Eat Free with purchase of an entree?  We will be back and will definitely recommend to others.... Great service!"}
{"text":"After driving by a few times and seeing what looked like a good-sized tap selection, we decided to stop in around 10pm on a Saturday.  While the venue is pretty expansive, we were two of maybe ten patrons total.  Not always a problem for us though, so we headed to the bar to check out those taps.  Anchor Hummer, Sierra Nevada Pale, some domestics, a Four Peaks or two, and otherwise nothing exciting.    The HH menu looked great, though!  Lots of tasty-looking small plates all for $5 each?  I know if I were hungry, I would have a hard time narrowing it down to just one or two items!  Beers were $4 and HH wines were $5.    Atmosphere is urban contemporary, and the music/muzak I am pretty sure I recognized from shopping at DSW for boots last week.  We are 43 and were definitely the oldest people in the place.  While this isn't exactly my kind of place, I would return for snacks and drinks with the right group of friends.  It is worth a stop to check it out."}
{"text":"Went back last night to sit outside during this heavenly weather.  The place was packed at 4 PM and just as loud, even outside.  We each had a couple of drinks and the asparagus, artichoke, and calimari sides .  Although everything was good,  this place can benefit from better HH pricing and service.  Our server couldn't make any recommendations about the wine or drinks when I asked about specific ingredients such as citrus and wasn't helpful with my friend's wine questions either.  As far as pricing goes, daily specials may help there.  The calimari was ok, the asparagus & artichoke were stellar, and the aeoli was heavenly.  I really want to love this place but the prices have to get a LOT better before I go back"}
{"text":"Bartender Mick was great! Sat at table in front of bar, north side next to glass doors for dinner. TERRIBLE service. Had to ask for water twice, never got it. Asked what selections were vegan & vegetarian, the waiter had no idea. Asked about the mussels, waiter had to read off menu. Asked for sauce to go with bland/dry flatbread, took 15 minutes. No follow up after entrees served, had to flag the waiter down for aforementioned water & sauce. Food good, but not good enough to compensate for the service. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to Central Bistro on a Thursday night for happy hour (which ends at 6pm). Ordered one of their happy hour red wines and some bruchetta (BLT, Pear & Chicken). The wine was great (only $5) and the bruchetta was also delish. I love how they remove the walls and have it open during happy hour. It was a perfect day so that was a nice touch. I will definitely be coming back here with the hubby!"}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places to eat near my house. Last time we went we had the worst service ever. We sat and waited for 30 minutes and did not get helped. We asked for a menu and the waitress acted put out and said it would be a while bc the menus were in the other side of the restaurant. She never brought us one so I ended up going to get my own at the front of the restaurant (maybe 40 feet away).   When we finally decided to leave the waitress tried to make us stay by crying at our table she would not let us leave- SUPER awkward and unprofessional. I hope to try this place again eventually- hopefully the service will be better bc the food was great in the past."}
{"text":"I love Central Bistro! The ambiance is relaxing and never fails to boost my mood. It is an open environment where I can watch the game and listen to live music--whilst taking my taste buds on a wild ride. When the music isn't live, it is usually nostalgic '90s alternative, which adds to the aesthetically-pleasing decor and layout of the place.  Though I have only eaten there for brunch, I hear from my colleagues that the dinner is amazing. When brunching there, always get the donuts as an appetizer--you won't regret it. The steak and eggs and the chicken and waffles are also food of the gods.  Always swimming the extra mile, the service is immaculate! There is this super cool, skinny, blond dude that is really good at waiting on his section and makes everyone smile. This one waitress was also fantastically humorous. Class. That's all I can say.   Tl; dr: Excellent servers, fabulous music, great brunch."}
{"text":"What a great surprise. Love the revamped menu. Had probably the best Bolognese ever.  Halibut special was outstanding."}
{"text":"Central bistro is a great place. The restaurant itself is open and light with comfortable seating. With glass, brick, wood and marble being the main theme it was relaxed and  inviting. Our waiter was all business and handled our large group with professionalism. I did feel like our drinks took a long time to arrive but after that everything came efficiently. We were there for brunch and ordered the Drunken bread to start and it was fantastic. The bead was perfectly toasted and the cheese was melted and seasoned well. We shared with the table and everyone enjoyed. My fiancé ordered for us the chicken and waffles and the wedge salad. Both were some of the best I'd had in a long time and neither were lacking in presentation or taste. Afterwards they brought some warm chocolate chip cookies with a side of vanilla infused warmed milk and a piece of German chocolate cake which again was shared and enjoyed immensely by all.  I would recommend Central Bistro as a great place for couples, a few friends or large groups."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday night with a party of 10. The place wasn't too busy and the staff had our table ready and were expecting us. The service was exceptional all night. They were very attentive but never interrupted our conversations. I ordered the roasted chicken which was HUGE! It was cooked perfectly and full of delicious flavor. It was a wonderful night and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were really impressed with the food at Central Bistro.  As so many others have commented, the drunk bread is an excellent starter -- definitely get it with the prosciutto for an extra kick of flavor. We also had a perfectly cooked, juicy delicious burger and a wonderful pizza. The pizza was one if the best we've had in Phoenix -- charred crust with crunch but also chewy, really good sausage and spicy salami. There's a nice ambience at Central Bistro and they have an excellent wine selection. The Orin Swift Abstract is a very good red blend that we highly recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with huge windows that open and create an indoor-outdoor feel. Multiple patios and different dining areas make this large space look intimate.  The menu is a little bit of a hodgepodge of styles, which usually makes me cringe, but every dish was executed to perfection.   The presentation of the entrees was beautiful and every element of each dish tasted good.   I wish I could pick this place up and move it to Los Angeles so I could eat there more often."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. For the price, very average quality.  Good wine list. S'mores dessert was good but not quite up to what I hoped for.  More graham cracker please. And let the marshmallow seem identifiable.   Waiter needs more training and menu is way too expansive.  Lots of solid competition in the area. Central bistro did not woo me to leave my other favorites.  I'd go again but it's not on my list of choices."}
{"text":"This is definitely a return visit restaurant.  Great food, service and atmosphere.  I enjoyed the cauliflower appetizer/salad and swordfish.  I was extremely impressed what the Chef did for the presentation of something like cauliflower  The swordfish was a good portion for dinner and quite juicy...  I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it"}
{"text":"Went in the mid afternoon to hit up their Social Hour which adds an extra hour of time starting at 2. Dollar oysters were solid and the mignonette was perfect. The menu had just changed so we went for the Almond Bianco pizza to start which had a great balance of sweet and savory with a nicely charred crust. Next came the raw tuna dish with peanuts avocado and I believe ponzu?  Spectacular. My favorite of the meal. Great texture, balanced flavors and portion/plating was spot on. The seared scallop entree was tasty as well with a super creamy corn purée binding more fresh sweet kernels of corn. Scallops were cooked perfectly medium with a nice caramelization and the jalapeño pesto on top brought it all together. The pancetta wrapped shrimp were cooked just right and super tender. Paired well with the buttery rosemary beans underneath. The only thing I won't rave about was the clams over risotto with leeks. Although still a solid dish the flavor couldn't stand up to the battery of dishes we had already knocked down lol. I'm sure I'd be content had it been our only dish so don't let me shy you away. Last but not least my favorite dish from Central Bistro the crab spaghetti!!!  Oh my this dish is the one you must order should you come in for dinner. The spaghetti is sauced just right w buttery tomato sauce an tossed with super sweet crabmeat and finished w toasty bread crumbs. Big fan.   Obviously I highly recommend Central based on my review and it has only gotten better each time I try it out."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, and great atmosphere. Will definitely go back when I can afford to (it's expensive)."}
{"text":"This was my third time here...I don't recall much about my first two visits but this meal was exceptional. They have improved in everything from service, menu items, to recipes. I highly recommend the French onion soup and the steak frites. The kids menu is great -your kids will love the pizza and pasta options plus they eat for free before 6:00 during the week ."}
{"text":"After searching for a very specific combo of risotto and scallops at 4 places including Eddie V's, Dominick's some other place I can't remember where I met a dude named Jason that was there with his lady and told me I could find what I was looking for here. I drove 25 minutes to get what I wanted when I was already 30 minutes away from home.  I ordered the scallops with butternut nut squash risotto. Freaking good. Especially for this state. Totally chill spot. Katie is AMAZING! She was very understanding when my very specific a** sent back the scallops for being undercooked. That is by no means a reflection of what is being served. It was fixed quickly and accurately. Thanks again Katie!!!"}
{"text":"Central bistro is fast becoming our \"go to\" restaurant. Everyone who has dined with me there has LOVED their meals! We have been there for brunch and lunch several times.  One quick request...please bring back the Steakhouse Salad. It was AWESOME! My girlfriend and I had it last week but when I returned there for lunch with another friend this week it had been replaced with a Thai Steak Salad which I would have had if I were not allergic to soy and peanuts! When I inquired, the waiter said the Steakhouse Salad was not a good seller. That's hard to believe.   Again, PLEASE bring back the Steakhouse Salad soon!   Thank you!  Denise Stefanisin President VALUE OUR VETERANS, INC."}
{"text":"Wow! My boyfriend and I came here for their 3-course Valentine's Day meal and it was one of the best meals we have ever had! I ordered the warm asparagus salad, seabass and raspberry cake. My boyfriend ordered the seared scallops, filet of beef and black forrest cake. Each course, for both of us, was amazing! The seared scallops were served on top of cauliflower purée and it was soo tasty. The seabass seemed to be poached in olive oil and it was perfectly cooked with amazing flavor. I devoured the raspberry cake. For two people who eat out a lot, and at great restaurants, we were so impressed. The decor and atmosphere are wonderful too! A must if in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Overpriced salmon added - We went to this place because it was my birthday and we had not tried it in the past I ordered the superfood salad and on the recommendation of the waitress had salmon added to it - she did not tell me how much the salmon was going to be and I made the mistake of not asking for a center cut piece of the salmon  So salmon was not good - was not grilled enough to have good taste and it was the end cut and they charged me $12 for this piece of salmon which was just outrageous  I did enjoy the salad and should've just had the salad  I complained about the quality of the piece of salmon and thought that maybe she would respond - she just looked at me and cleared my plate and walked away - my husband did have the pizza and said it was OK - then we got the bill Yikes Our bill was $43 for pizza - salad with a piece of salmon which was outrageous - we live in Scottsdale - we go out to eat a lot and we have never paid $12 to add a piece of salmon to a salad anywhere anytime anyplace  So after another complaint they did give us credit but the woman that waited on us was very short and brisk And the manager never came over to even talk to us - we will not be going back to this place - we felt they were rude to us despite the fact that they gave us credit for a piece of fish that certainly didn't cost them much"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great ambiance. The staff is very friendly! The meal superb.......had the drunk bread for a starter followed by the grilled octopus with fusilli, followed by decadent dessert of the lemon tart and sticky toffee pudding!OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!.......Highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"We came in here for Sunday brunch and we loved it! They had a live band which we enjoyed so much.  Mimosas and bloody Mary's were $15 unlimited with 1 cent refills. I heard the menu has changed, looking forward to try their new items!"}
{"text":"This is a great upscale casual restaurant.  Wide variety of food so there is something for everyone. Good wine selection. Cheese board is fantastic.  Professional staff."}
{"text":"impressed, had the duck 3 ways as an appetizer...delicious! My husband had the Chicken Parm its was huge came with mac & cheese and a tomato sauce (lacking on the flavor) but over all very good. I enjoyed the chicken pesto pizza phenomenal! Perfect crust! Staff were very friendly including the manager Tom. We will certainly be returning."}
{"text":"I was and still am happy to see a new resaurant pop up in this area.  I have been able to dine at Central Bistro twice since it has opened.  The restaurant has an impressive wine list and knowledgable servers.  I wish the food was as impressive. I was with a group and we ordered 8 different dishes to share family style.  I enjoyed a delish salad and the standout entree was the chicken parmasan with a side of mac & cheese.   Central Bistro did a wonderful job on the buildout and decor.  I will definitley be back for a glass of wine, but there are other italian restaurants I prefer in the area.  Not bad, not great but worth another try someday."}
{"text":"New owners and a changed menu. The Caesar salad used to have a hard boiled egg and shaved Parmesan. Now, for $10, you can get a small portion of lettuce with grated Parmesan, hardly identifiable. And they now charge for bread service. Dinner=disappointing. However, their breakfasts are very, very good!"}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here the service and food are consistently great. I thoroughly enjoy each time I come here and support this restaurant fully. Their pizzas are amazing Btw. Doesn't need many words to describe how wonderful this place is. Just come and experience it for yourself. I have no complaints! I can safely say the best and my favorite restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"Would love to give this restaurant the full five stars as it is one of my favorites in Phoenix but must conceded that the kitchen is a bit slow so tough on the kids. Other then that, a great dining experience. Really good drinks and wine selection, fairly extensive menu covering a wide array of foods and fun desserts and salads. Haven't had a single item that isn't fantastic. Very professional and helpful waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great happy hour chicken sliders to dive for, love the open look."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a year or two.  We always drive by, and the first time I was there is was really good but for some reason we just never made it back. Wait, now I remember, it is the tough to find parking.  Well we popped by to see if they were busy yesterday and we got a parking spot right on front (what do you know).  We sat in the bar area and I have to tell you, this is a hidden gem in Phoenix.  Well not exactly hidden as it has a great corner property facing out toward Camelback, but I mean hidden as in you need to go check it out.   The service was TOP NOTCH (Hillstone caliber which is always my benchmark), but I have to tell you I think Central Bistro is right there.  The one downside, I ordered the thai steak salad, I have to say I didn't LOVE IT (if I would have loved it I would have dished out the FIVE STAR DADDY).  It was good but not great.  The bread and cheese dish there however is AMAZEBALLS and I will be back soon to try a few more things on the menu.  Its a very classy place and one I will bring my future business clients to.  Well done!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, service, ambiance, as well as gluten free knowledge and options. Highly recommend! I will likely become a regular!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times so far on separate occasions for happy hour, lunch, and dinner. If I was just judging on the happy hour and lunch, I would say this would be about a 4 star experience, but dinner really fell flat.   The first time my husband and I came in was for happy hour, which is daily from 2-6pm. We had the grapefruit margaritas, which were very refreshing with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. After the margarita we decided to change it up with an apple martini, which wasn't nearly as good as the margarita.   Our second visit was for lunch. We decided on the calamari salad and the drunk bread. The calamari was lightly fried and cooked very well, over mixed greens, with capers, onions, and pieces of crab meat. The crab meat was a little fishy, and as much as I love crab it didn't really do anything for the dish and I could have done without it. The drunk bread was a large piece of day old bread, cooked in a skillet with white wine and swiss cheese. This was very good, like a fondue grilled cheese combination, but a little pricey for $12.  Our third visit was for dinner. I decided on the veggie pasta with pesto and my husband had the margherita pizza. My pasta was a small portion of spaghetti with spiraled veggies, with a pesto sauce. My dish had decent flavor, but the pesto was too oily for my taste (I've made better at home) and just wasn't very impressive. Also, the portion size seemed skimpy at $16. My husband's pizza was just weird. It was stated as a \"margherita\" on the menu, which we were expecting more of a traditional Napoli pizza with fresh mozzarella. It really was just a cheese pizza with a few ribbons of basil on it, it tasted decent but like a NY style pizza and was salty. Also, you couldn't really taste the sauce. The weirdest thing about the pizza was that there was a blob of buffalo mozzarella on top of the cheese pizza. The pizza would have been way better if they just used the buffalo mozzarella INSTEAD of the shredded mozzarella, it was odd to have both. Seems like they were being a little frugal on the ingredients.  So I will be back again, but probably just for happy hour or lunch. I would not recommend dinner, as it's overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat out five nights a week.  We know what is acceptable and what is not when it comes to ambiance.  We booked a table for the patio...and dropped German's name as he is the Gran Fromage.  When we arrived...on time...we were told no tables on the patio.  We were given the choice of a table in the bar ...or a table in the dining room. Given that the noise level was so pronounced in the bar...we opted for a dark table in the dining room. We sat down, and when the server arrived with the water, we were unable to communicate with each other, as the noise level was intolerable.  Not chic...but NOISE.  So loud, we opted to bolt...and went to another establishment.  I think German does a great job at Local Bistro and would at Central Bistro ife he got the noise level down to an acceptable level.  I was most unhappy that our reservation was not carried out as specified.....but even more disappointed that the lame assed interior DECORATOR thought the noise would be acceptable.  Interior designers and Architects are idiots.  They will blow smoke at you and have you think they know something...when in fact, most all are friggin hacks.  Will not return to any of his restaurants...as we found the noise to be a game changer.  Good luck with the over 35 crowd.  You'll never make it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed dinner here tonight in an up and coming strip mall with surprisingly good choices of food and drinks.    We had a party of six here tonight and our waiter, Andy, did everything he could to  ensure our visit was enjoyable.  Dinner began with a nice selection of wines although Katherine tried a wine flight since she couldn't decide on what red she wanted for the night.  Our appetizers were padro peppers, a small pizza, prosciutto and drunken bread.  Great flavor, nice presentation and not too much to ruin our dinner.   We all tried something a little different for our main course including Clam Bake, Spicy Cab Spaghetti, Crispy Salmon and the Bolognaise.    Everyone enjoyed their meals, good portions, great flavor, plenty for everyone to share.   The only down side was the wait was longer than expected.  I think Andy may have forgotten to put our order in or the Clam Bake took extra long.  Regardless, we will hopefully return soon."}
{"text":"The online menu is not what you get.  If you are gluten free, forget about being able to eat as the unhelpful waiter will tell you he doesn't know what GF is and has to ask the chef.  The \"helpful\" chef will not put chicken on your $ .15 worth of Costco organic greens, but suggests you purchase the $27 chicken entree, ditch the sides to put on your purchased salad.   My friends ordered steak that looked like hardened hockey pucks with overly salted string fries.  Steaks were medium rare when my friend ordered medium. Our waiter was so unaccommodating  that it wasn't even worth it to complain  We had been here before and had a different experience. The management is either uncaring , miserable or both.  We will never return to Central Bistro. No do-overs here."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical about this place, but I'm so glad we gave it a try! Beautiful interior, very classy. I love how they give you a choice of lemon, lime or orange to flavor your water with.  I got a margherita pizza and my husband got some sort of pork dish. Neither of us were blown away with what we got, but we didn't regret it, either. What we DID regret was not getting a burger and fries, we saw them at a nearby table and they both looked amazing! Good date place, probably even better with a group though."}
{"text":"Shorter version: Good service. Good food. A little on the spendy side especially for lunch. Get the drunk bread with prosciutto. Looks terrible but tastes awesome.   Longer version: Came here for lunch with some work people. We had a reservation since there were 8 of us. I got the wild mushroom pasta and it was tasty. They definitely didn't cheap out on the mushrooms. It had a hint of truffle flavor and it was creamy. Maybe inly slightly too heavy. But I was actually full from shoveling the drunk bread into my gullet as the 7 others stared at me. Id literally go there and just order two and make it my entree. At least, if it wasn't so looked down upon, I would. I might anyways. I'll let you know how it goes.   Anyways, service was solid. Can't remember if they've done this in my previous visits, but they gave us desserts on the house at the end and said it was for the first timers in our group."}
{"text":"Beautiful Day!  The open air patio with a breeze was splendid.   It seems to me many chefs are scared to use salt in their cooking.  This may be salt shy chef.  I rarely add salt to a plate, but it was necessary this time.  However as an eater of food it isn't the same to add salt at the table as when the chef adds salt into his sauces and blends in so much better."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, went for lunch on Friday. We had the drunk bread to start, the classic one. We literally scraped all of the cheese out of ths skillet, thats how good it was...not an exaggeration, probably the cleanest skillet theyve had returned to the kitchen. I had the club panini with a side of pesto. Im a pesto freak, adding that to the sandwich really took it there omg. My boyfriend had the grilled chicken sandwich, which was also  really good.  We both got truffle fries with our sandwiches, they were not really that great, a bit salty and the truffle suce wasnt the best I've had but apart from that, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first time at Central Bistro. The restaurant itself is very spacious and clean and is located in the Biltmore area. One of signs that tips me off to good restaurants is when there are regulars that come in (with smiles) and the staff immediately welcomes them by name. I felt like there was family all around me. They have a killer happy hour with some good deals - $1 oysters and half off pizzas were a couple that stood out to me. All the staff members were very friendly but my bartender (Katie) rocked it tonight. She was quick, friendly, informative and was training someone at the same time and didn't miss a beat. It was clear that the people there appreciate her. I have 10 years in the restaurant business and was quite impressed.The drunk bread was super delicious as was the risotto. Highest praises to this place and I will be stopping in again"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. I liked the open atmosphere in this place. The tables are set well enough apart to allow privacy. Good menu selection including many gluten free choices. I had a delicious prime rib sandwich. The service was attentive. I shall return."}
{"text":"First time we came in was just after the ownership change ON Valentine's Day.  The service as so bad they shut down the restaurant at 2pm.  Food was as terrible as one hour delay to get it.    Second trip two Months later, this place is horrible still.  So bummed.  The menu is a shadow of its former self.  Key items are completely gone.   Bottomless drinks come with glacial service.   They were out of many items... Pancakes!   How do you run out of flour and water?   New ownership has taken the heart and sole out of the kitchen.   Too bad.  This was out go to place for years.   Anyone having any luck finding something new??"}
{"text":"Swanky new \"hot spot\" resturant. Pricey, but worth it! I ate at the bar. Had the chicken parmasan. I don't think there is a person alive that could finish it! Portions were huge! They have a seriously extensive selection of beers and whine, I was a little tame and only had s couple four peaks pears. Probably a great place to take a date, but cute entertaining bartenders if youre flying solo. Amazing service, awesome food, great atmosphere. 5 stars all arround! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  I am going back"}
{"text":"Fairly new restaurant - and a real treat.  I'd say it gives True Foods a run for its money - altho the food is more American/Italian/Southwest.  It is now definitely on my list for dining in central Phoenix."}
{"text":"A couple of NOT GOODS, when initially seated (5:20pm), I waited 14 minutes for someone to contact me for water or a drink ?  Once our server came over her service level was very good 2nd NOT GOOD (a huge pet peeve) wine vintage on wine list did not match stock on hand. You cannot list an 06 or 07 Cab and sub a 2010 or 2011 cab at the same price Unfortunately those two NOT GOODS would have me rate Central Bistro as a 6 out of 10"}
{"text":"Visited last night for dinner and I thought I should post an update.  The service was spectacular & the chicken parm ( bigger than a house) was incredible!!! It feeds at least 2 people and has a nice arugula salad on top with a side of tomato sauce. It also comes with a side of mac n cheese. I highly recommend this dish for some comfort.  My hubby had the bolognese and was huge fan as well.   TIP: They offer Sunday brunch with $15 all you can drink mimosa's & bloody Mary's.  I know where I'm headed for the weekend."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Server forgot to ask for drinks. Chicken was ok, vegetables were overly foraged and limp. Didn't have wine but they did have extensive list. Nice bar area. Improvement to service and tastier dishes would make this a star better."}
{"text":"Entrees were pretty good, but the reason for the three star review was the charcuterie board.  White cheddar and brie...really?  Plus the meats reminded me of a cheap subway cold cut.  Not worth the $16 price tag.  Hanger steak and salmon were both decent."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review for Central Bistro for a couple weeks now so here it goes:)  I met my girlfriend for lunch here a few weeks ago... we were both excited to try it out.  What a difference from Zen32 - i love the look and feel of this restaurant and the amazing wine room on display.  We were kind of in a hurry so instead of ordering something that would take time I decided on the caeser salad and french onion soup they both were really good.  My girlfriend had the Parma Panini which she raved about.  The service was very attentive from the moment that we sat down at the table and got us out of there quickly which we appreciated.  I would love to come back and try dinner some time when I am not in a hurry.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Started going to Local Bistro in North Scottsdale a couple years ago but only recently made it to Central Bistro. The menu is absolutely fabulous and the service is wonderful. I've tried many of their dishes but one of my favorites is the Black Linguini. One of the Managers at Central, Chris, always takes good of us when we come in."}
{"text":"I think I really enjoyed the cheese plate last time I went.  I also went this year for the Restaurant Week menu.  Everything I ordered was not what I expected (gnocchi, pea soup, salmon, lamb chops).  The portions were a bit small (except for the soup, that was a solid 2 cups of puree), but we did leave full.  The menu is adventurous and creative - don't go unless you're up for it.  The desserts were probably the best part of the menu - german chocolate cake and cheesecake.  The cheesecake is super smooth and just about the best we've had in a long time."}
{"text":"The one item you must try is the compound butter...oh my is it FAB!  Mushroom truffle pasta very rich, blue point oysters fresh & delish. Parking is the downfall at CB."}
{"text":"I love so much about CB, from the open, airy, Italian cafe atmosphere, to the amazing food and service. But I recently found another thing to love: CB Weekend brunch. Holy moly is it amazing! I visited on a Saturday around noon with my in-laws and we were all blown away. I had the crab Benedict and I was in love from my first glance. There was a really good amount of sumptuous lump crap meat and asparagus chunks topped with the perfect egg and hollandaise. It was amazing beyond words. I didn't have the only first rate dish either! My FIL had CB's rendition of Chicken and Waffles and I must admit, as much as I was loving my dish, I had a twinge of diners envy. It looked Freaking Scrumptious!!! My MIL had the veggie omelette, and it was stellar as well. CB IS serious about its food. I have been for dinner as well and have never seen or heard of anything mediocre or ok- their stuff is GOOD!! Dinner selections that rock are the ravioli of the day, everyday I have love love loved their offerings. The chicken parm is a whole lotta awesome food for one dish. You will definitely be taking home leftovers. I'm also a fan of the clam linguine. It has chorizo, which I never would have thought to add, but it was superb. Last shout out goes to the drunken bread app- if I could have it everyday and not gain a zillion pounds I would without a doubt! CB is a really cool, tasty place that you should put on your \"to do\" list ASAP!"}
{"text":"I CANNOT believe I haven't scribbled a love note about this place! Staff is completely utterly UHMAZING. They love their job and they do a fantastic job showing you why. I can't gush enough about management staff other than I'd steal them fore safekeeping. Nina and Chris will wow you with their smile, infectious laughter and impeccable attention to detail!  I adore the social hour because who doesn't want to socialize when you can be sipping on sangrias, grilled arthichokes and naturally a few dozen of the best oysters from both the East and West Coast. It happens every day from 2-6 which explains all the faithful regulars and locals. There's not a bad spot and the energy is contagious. I've been here for brunch. Lunch. Dinner. If you dine outside those times, I recommend the breakfast pizza. Yes there is such a thing and it's perfect after a workout. Dessert is always a crowd pleaser from the homebaked cookies with vanilla infused milk or the decadent German chocolate cake. Did you not see my pictures? You should be drooling!  I really should just forward my mail here. My friends are never disappointed and I've left several tips because every time I go I am always pleasantly surprised. Central Bistro you sure know how to treat others with how you feel inside! They leave you feeling good. Best feeling ever. Love you, one of your biggest adoring fan."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood place. The first time I ate here, my son & I went for brunch. When our waiter learned it was our first visit, he told the manager, who brought us a delicious complimentary dessert. Smart move: I've been back several times, and each time gets better.   My favorites: chicken risotto, roasted artichoke hearts (incredibly smoky flavor), cheese boards (with frozen grapes!), any of the eggs benedict for brunch and, of course, their wine list.  My only complaint is the noise level. I'm pushing 50, so the hearing is just starting to go. If it's nice out, opt for outside where the cacophony  of the bar area doesn't drown out your conversations.    Ok, I have another complaint - the parking sucks and their valet is hit and miss. My husband and I ate here on New Years Eve, and I was wearing heels - didn't want to hike across Safeway's parking lot - and they had no valet service.   However ... the food, wine list and service are worth the walk ..."}
{"text":"I really really enjoy it all here! The product (especially the cold beer), great oysters, great pizza. The staff is.phenomenal from hostess, to bartender to management.   I have read reviews claiming this place is pretentious, and I disagree. I roll in jeans and a polo shirt. Probably the worst dresser in the place! Everyone else is in ties, or sports jackets, or dresses etc. I have never felt out of place or have been made feel uncomfortable because of my.apparel. Always served with a smile.  Management rocks. Quick to step up and help when staff is in the weeds, and they go above and beyond to right a wrong.  Central bistro is definitely one of my go-to-spots!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a late lunch here on a Saturday afternoon.  We usually go to North or one of the other restraunts near Arcadia/Biltmore but decided last minute to try something new.  The design of the restaurant is contemporary but classic, well lit and comfortable.  I ordered the calamari salad which was good(not fabulous, but quite good).  My boyfriend ordered the hamburger and thought it was ok (not as good as Zin Burger).  The french fries, however, were excellent!!!    The food was good and worthy of a 3 or 4 star rating.  However, the service was lousy.  The server who helped us was incredibly dour!  He was very stern, unfriendly and had no idea how to smile.  He brought items as needed (ie. extra salad dressing) - but scowled as he did it and was completely unpleasant to deal with.  We spoke to a very nice manager (young female) about this experience and she apologized for his behavior.  She told us he was having a rough day and some personal problems.  Of course, I am sorry that he was having a difficult day- but that does not excuse being rude to customers.  He should not be dealing with the public if he cannot hide his anger and annoyance.  Moreover, while the manager was very nice, I thought her explanatoin was lacking.  Quite simply, one's personal problems do not excuse bad service and I thought it was a bit unprofessional that she shrugged off the poor service to him having a bad day.  We will not go back due to the rude service and the management's complete lack of interest in fixing the matter."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  Nothing extremely impressive.  I have never had a good service experience here.  The last time I was here I was celebrating the Holidays with some people from my office.  I was given a card with a gift card inside of it from one of my coworkers and left it at the restaurant.  When I called to see if they had put it in a lost and found bin the hostess actually knew specifically where I was sitting which seemed very bizarre.  After placing me on hold for several minutes she answered and said they actually didn't have it and told me to have a nice day.  I tried to reach out via e-mail to management to give them a heads up on a sketchy situation but they never replied to my communication."}
{"text":"Another great addition to the Camelback corridor!  This place has a lively, upscale vibe to it.  We were seated in the back corner, so it was a little quieter, which was nice.  I started with a bellini and it was delicious.  We shared the drunk bread and it was surprisingly addicting...I could have eaten an order all on my own.  I ordered the chicken parmesan and it was delicious, but a huge portion!  Everything about this place is top notch...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Lunch today and it was very pleasant with the open air set-up. Very pleasant ambiance and friendly service.  Lots of interesting items on the menu but we tried salads.  Tasty and fresh but next time I would say dressing on the Side!  Salmon Cobb is GOOD but definitely next time I would skip ranch and get vinaigrette (on the side as previously mentioned!!)  Close to work.  Get your fresh air/sunlight fix. Definitely would love HH here with the patio seating."}
{"text":"Central Bistro has never blown me away with its creativity, but it is good and consistent. An interesting cocktail menu, somewhat basic but tasty fare, and really good service. The Thai steak salad is always good, as is the peppercorn NY strip. I really enjoyed the roasted beet appetizer and salmon entrée last time I was there. I cannot resist the beignets but it is hard to screw up sugar-covered fried dough. We got a bottle of wine that had turned, and they were really nice about swapping it out."}
{"text":"We have dined here a couple times before but last night was the first time we had sat on the kitchen side of the restaurant. I love that it's open yet glassed in keeping the usual kitchen noise out of the dining room. However, the chairs are atrocious! So uncomfortable and the bench seating is so warm and inviting that I think they don't really work together. New seats in the beautiful spacious dining room would make us want to stay and enjoy after dinner drinks and dessert. Just a thought. Megan was our server and she was very attentive and friendly. I only give three stars because I really felt my dish was just okay and the portions for the price on both entrees was a bit steep. I had the pan seared sea bass and got a not so tasty couple of clams that had me steer clear of the rest and the link style sliced chorizo was hard on texture and left a gamey after taste. I liked the fish itself but a 4 to 6 oz piece of fish being really all I ate left me a bit hungry. My boyfriend had the spaghetti with spicy crab. It was pretty good but the portion could use improvement. We have enjoyed central on previous occasions so we will be back."}
{"text":"Egg's Benedict were incredible.  We went for brunch, need to back and try their dinner or lunch service.  It's definitely the party brunch spot with live music and bottomless drinks.  I prefer a more mellow brunch but would go back for the Egg's Benedict alone.  They are getting lots of breakfast competition on that corner though but maybe that will help with getting a reservation. They give first timers cookies and cream, always a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Food was slightly better than average. Service was good, other great places in the area to try. If you head to the restaurant remember that it's not a five star dining experience just above average food."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing daily happy hour that features $1 oysters, $5 house wine, and half price small plates, which include deliciousness like beef tartar and grilled artichoke.  Basically, rich people food without rich people prices, which I am all about.  I probably wouldn't come here during non-happy hour unless it was a special occasion.  The restaurant itself is beautiful with an open floorplan and wall to ceiling windows that can open which essentially puts the whole restaurant on a gigantic patio, perfect for when the weather is like this.  The only issue I had with the service was they put Lance and I at the smallest table in the world, during Happy Hour when they have half price small plates (and $1 oysters which we all know the monstrosity of tableware that oysters require).  I get that there were only two of us, and our server tried to time the dishes to we didn't get everything at once, but we definitely needed some real estate.  I'd definitely recommend their happy hour for when you want to live large on a small budget (and at a small table)."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch & was so excited from everything I've heard about it, but was kinda disappointed. I ordered the 3 different types of eggs Benedict & I know they could have been SO amazing if the eggs weren't overcooked. The yoke was not runny so it didn't make what the dish should have been. I thought maybe it was just my plate, but it was like that for 2 of my friends & others I noticed who ordered that dish. It's a shame cause it would be amazing if they could fix that. Also, I work in the industry & was unimpressed to say the least in how the staff was trained to deal with customers"}
{"text":"We visited on a busy Friday evening.  The place was packed and had great energy.  There was a wait which really didn't matter since we like to sit at the bar so when two seats quickly opened and we sat immediately.  The ambiance is worth five stars alone.  The decor, the open windows and the amazing wine room make this place inviting and attractive.  After ordering the wine and an appetizer (Wood Grilled Artichoke) we waited...and waited...and waited some more.  The bartender noticed how long we waited several times and kept checking with the kitchen.  After about 35 minuets and an apology from the bartender the artichokes we delivered by someone...perhaps a manager with another very forced and dry apology.  The chokes were OK, but not fully cooked but the ailoi was delicious.  As expected  two minutes after the app was dropped our entrees arrived...annoying.  The Grilled Vegetable dish was served with a goat cheese spread and overall was good but not something I'd order again (my fault for ordering).  My husband had the Steak Frites and enjoy it.    As soon as the check was dropped the service dropped.  Not once did the bartender ask if we wanted another glass of wine when our glasses sat empty for nearly 30 min nor was there any further contact from any employee.  The best part of the whole experience was when the bartender who wad been serving us that night grabs her purse, clocks out and then sits next to the guy sitting next to us and starts having a conversation.  I guess she didn't care that we hadn't paid yet...she must not be hurting for tips?  I understand food timing issues and that kitchens get backed up sometimes but I don't understand poor service and the lack of recovery from staff and especially the managers.  If something is wrong at a table or the bar, it is the managers responsibility to take action and not ignore it."}
{"text":"Great place and service. Had the seared salmon, ordered it RARE, and they served it RARE!!! So many establishments over cook  fish. Central did it right. Nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Summer Sangria... Delicious!! Peanut Butter & Banana stuffed French toast... To die for!! 3 big TV's in the bar area... If I lived closer, I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"Upscale modern and amazing food. Great wine selection and the best ambiance for sexy dinner for two."}
{"text":"New chef, menu , and owner today. No more drunk bread or bolanese. :( things on the menu I can't pronounce and don't know what they are ( neither did the server ).  Already missing my Central Bistro and social hour."}
{"text":"Great food, new owners as of a week ago. The hostess handed us the happy hour menu but didn't seat us right away, made it seem like a lot of people look at the menu then leave. I had to ask if she was going to seat us awkward moment.  Don't go with expectations of their old menu as almost everything was different. No oysters, no clam bake, no bevy of delicious deserts. We did order off their happy hour menu which we recommend. The flat iron steak was cooked to perfection, the burger was great too. The cauliflower appetizer was ok, the artichokes were very small but had that great grilled flavor and the dipping sauce tasted like mayonnaise. The drunken bread was a reconstructed fondue but very good. Not sure if we would go back."}
{"text":"Short story.   A-OK but not Very Good at Price Point. I do note we only had lunch and maybe they shine more at dinner time. I also note three stars is still a positive review.  Long story.  This is a pristine clean modern beautiful place. The tables are spaced nicely and we were very comfortable. The waitstaff looked mature. The start you off with fresh crusty bread with rosemary herb ed butter and sliced fruit for your water.  I ordered the Tuna Sashimi Salad. The tuna was fresh and had a very hot and spicy chili oil under it that I liked. Unfortunately the sear on the fish was disappointing since it was grey on all sides. If I screwed up searing this same fish at home I'd get my pan hotter and not screw up the other sides. This might sound silly but I wasn't sure how to eat this salad the way it was spread out. The salad was OK but sort of boring and was just an OK salad at $15.00.  The Thai Steak Salad I might have sent back if it was mine and I do note it's possible they just didn't make it correctly. Number one neither of us recognized anything Thai about this salad but that didn't matter anyway. If it was my salad I would have sent it back because of the very bitter dressing and I do note they must have made an error making it because nobody would knowingly make something that tasted like that. I did taste the steak and it was OK. When the waiter checked on us my husband didn't say anything but told me about the salad after. I told him I wouldn't be able to eat it and mine was OK. This steak salad was $18.00  Two salads a soda and a iced tea $41.40 before tip.  We did look around and many other plates looked really good."}
{"text":"Central Bistro rocks everyday but especially on Mondays. We sat at the bar and experienced amazing hospitality our way from Hurley the bartender. Monday's ate all day HH. $1 fresh oysters are amazing. The drunken Swiss fondue bread is yum yum. Cocktails rock!!!!"}
{"text":"The menu sounds amazing. I was wishing I could taste several things on the menu but, I knew I wouldn't make rent if I did.  $9 to add salmon, French Onion soup is $12  Try the Power Lunch special or the  1/2 & 1/2 with a salad, soup or sandwich.   I had the Kale Salad with Chicken.  The Kale was fresh and nicely chopped and the chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled. Served warm on the greens, just the way I like it. As for the rest of the salad mehh.  The cranberries were hard and dry, the feta was too spare to add anything and the walnuts that were suppose to be candied.....were plain. The honey mustard didn't seem to be a good match so I asked for the lemon vinaigrette. Too tart to be edible!  I would suggest golden raisins, goat cheese and or some kind of coating on the walnuts spicy-sweet would help.  And salad dressings should compliment not compete with the salad.  Service, setting and decor are spot on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here for the first time for our anniversary and all I can say is AMAZING!  The food was delicious and the service was impressive.  We had the asparagus with egg and the cheeseboard for starters - so good.  For our entrees, I had mac-n-cheese with chicken and chorizo and my husband had the scallops risotto and everything was perfect.  The manager even came over early and gave us a glass of champagne for our special night and our server was very personable and knew the menu well.  I will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Pricing with good drinks & service.  Bathroom situation for women was interesting to say the least...sinks on the outside near wine rack...noisy bar & dining area so not a great place for a quiet evening out.  I think the food was good & the service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"Went last night with another couple.  Food: I had steak frites, steak was about 4 ounces, cooked perfect but so small. Fries were soggy. Side salad was awful. Fiancé had pasta, not homemade and just bland. Other couple ordered the half chicken and that looked fantastic and she said was excellent. He ordered the duck, was good but again small portions.  Service- slow but a friendly waiter.  Note: manager is a bit creepy, likes to come up to all the women and ask if \"everything ok\" in the middle of dinner service. We thought that was extremely odd and you can see the other diners looking a bit jilted by it as well.  Interior- very nicely done and sharp. A NY feel to it, downside it's very loud and hard to have a discussion without raising your voice.  Drinks and wine- cocktails they make are fantastic. Wine list is not extensive but well done. A bit pricey wine per glass.  Prices: a tad high for the quality and portion size.  Reservations at 7- sat right away, food arrived at 8:15, left at 9. Kitchen needs to get act together.  Overall: it's \"decent\" at best. Hopefully they will improve and work out kinks."}
{"text":"Central Bistro is located at a prime Biltmore location which is sure to make it a winner. I was excited about this restaurant opening since it's in my neighborhood. Zen32 was the previous restaurant  at this location. They did a nice job on the redesign, it's very modern and clean looking. Even though the place looks nice because of the wood floors and general design the acoustics are really bad; It's very loud and it makes it difficult to have a dinner conversation. When I evaluate a restaurant I do not base it on the food alone. Other factors like ambiance, service and how user-friendly it is are important to me. The staff was friendly and eager to please. I don't think the service is slow, I just think the place is new. In terms of being user-friendly, the menu is certainly not user friendly. It's printed in a silver micro font on a white background. This along with poor lighting makes it a real challenge to read. It's a good thing I had my trusty iPhone flashlight to read the menu. I have eaten at CB three times, once for lunch and twice for dinner. I had a halibut dish which was delicious and well presented. The hamburger is good but not remarkable. I enjoyed their pasta dishes and thought the sauce was really good. Aside from the micro print on the menu and the bad acoustics, I think this place is well worth visiting more than once."}
{"text":"I was in last Wednesday.  We had a delightful evening.  I was surprised at how good the food was.  Considering the location in a strip mall, I didn't have high expectations.  The service was great.  Our waitress was very attentive.  I ordered the scallop risotto.  I thought it was absolutely delicious.  The scallops were perfectly cook.  My husband ordered the pasta bolognese and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  My niece had the steak salad and it was also delicious.  The low point of the meal was desert, the beignets were a bit hard.  I prefer mine to be a bit more delicate.  Overall the experience was good and we will be back."}
{"text":"We went not knowing that they changed their menu.  We had family in town and the old menu is still online.  We showed them ,everyone was excited to go.  Surprised to get there and it was a completely different menu, mostly Italian dishes.  They sat us, gave us two menus for six people saying that they would bring more over when available.  They never arrived.  The food wasn't that great.  Always really loved this restaurant.  Hope they can work out the kinks."}
{"text":"Never again! Long wait for brunch so we sat at the bar right away. Our server/bartender was clearly new or just really did not care. We were treated like it was 145 am in old town.  First we could barely hear anything that she was saying and made zero attempt to change that. What does your Benedict come on? \"Ummmm, maybe like an English muffin?\" Does this sandwich have any meat? \"No, it's just like egg.\" Wrong girlfriend. Covered in meat, thank god no one was a vegetarian. Had to ask for silverware and salt and pepper. I know you can't control your customers and I should've known better than coming to this area to eat. The last straw was when blondie bartender aggressively plopped our to go container right in front of us when the ladies in their yoga pants sat next to us. Then we got attitude from the plastics next to us because we made a face when the bartender did that. Either they are used to being treated like garbage or haven't seen actual facial expressions since their first Botox injection.   I will not return again and will not be recommending to anyone. So many other great spots to check out where people are attentive and actually know the menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Central Bistro 5 times and have had excellent experiences on all but one occasion. That time, the problem was resolved rapidly by a very thoughtful waiter, manager and chef.  The staff are very concerned about their image and go overboard wherever possible to please their customers.  It is great to have another good restaurant in our neighborhood, especially one that understands how to be successful in the restaurant business.  May they live long and prosper."}
{"text":"From the pictures and reviews i thought it would be good. Kind of a disappointment. Food is good but nothing to write home about.  Simple but not cheap and the server wasnt all that great!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed our meal but when you have two Italian heavyweights in the neighborhood, Noca and Trattoria Bianco, you can't help but think that this place comes off as sort of corporate and inauthentic in comparison."}
{"text":"Hmm... where to start, where to start. When you first walk in, the bar is right in front of you along with the bar/lounge area. It's open, modern and a bit urban. To the left is a partially expo kitchen and the dining room. I sat up at the bar and received a prompt and friendly welcome by the bartender. I was quickly offered water and asked about my drink of preference. I chose a glass of red wine, a pinot noir, quite tasty.  Looking at the menu, it offers a variety of options from small plates and appetizers to pizzas, pastas, seafood and steaks. So many wonderful choices I was not sure what to try. I decided to try the duck risotto for an appetizer. it was remarkable. The flavors evenly balanced and risotto cooked quite nicely. Then I asked the bartender what he recommended as far as red meat goes... naturally I went with the suggestion: Filet Oscar with a side of grilled asparagus.  I was quite happy with my choice! The steak was cooked to a beautiful medium rare, the crab on top was not just lumped on like most places do an Oscar-styled steak. It was actually more like a crab cake. It was a very nice twist. The Bearnaise came on the side which was also nice that the dish was not drowning in it. The chef also did well with the asparagus, not over grilled and shrunken.  Then for dessert, I pondered over my choices and ended up ordering the beignets. There were three different dipping sauces: a dark chocolate, a sweet ricotta and a caramel. The pastries were not overly sugared and had a slight crispness to them. As for the sauces, I admit myself a bit disappointed. The chocolate was the only decent one among them. The others lacked flavor and character.  Overall, the experience itself was quite nice. I enjoyed the company I kept as well as the bartenders witty personality and conversations. I will be back to enjoy another good meal. :)"}
{"text":"A friend made me come here... and I am glad she did.  Food was fantastic.  Had the grilled artichokes for an appetizer, and realized I could have just ordered another for the main course. Had a good burger, and the drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Great experience for our first time here.  Snacked on a few different apps, a fresh salad and a solid sandwich.  Service was spot on, prompt and friendly.  I like the decor and the different lighting fixtures. Will probably check out happy hour as the sever suggested it a few times maybe because we were hitting up a late lunch."}
{"text":"This week marked my first (and second) visits to Central Bistro.  After a friend suggested it as a happy hour spot, I drove over to meet her and was welcomed by a smiling staff.  We were seated near the open air patio and water was poured immediately.  They left a bottle on the table so we cod refill as needed, though the attentive staff made sure I never had to do this myself.  This started off a great evening and alleviated my concerns after a few less than ideal reviews from other friends.  We all ordered the Margarita pizza, half price til 6 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The fresh burrata in the center elevated the pizza and was a treat.    One friend ordered vodka tonic and was surprised at the generous pour.  I had prosecco and ordered a second glass since it was so yummy and refreshing.  After the server learned that it was our first time at the restaurant, he had the manager stop by to say hello and we received a complimentary vanilla bean panna cotta.  The vanilla flavor was epic.    The server was pleasant and informed us about the upcoming #Driven2Dine event that Lincoln was hosting and offered to let us make reservations for a complimentary 3 course dinner if we tested out the new car.  I asked for the catch and was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was actually a great deal.  I happily returned, drove the Lincoln and feasted on an Arugala salad, Branzino and key lime pie.  I will definitely be back and will refer friends here for future meals and happy hours!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I really enjoy dining here on date night, as well as meeting up with friends for happy hour after work. The food and cocktails are great, and the atmosphere is really fun."}
{"text":"Things I loved, things I didn't love.  I guess I'm at a solid 3.499999 on this one.  Although I only had one mimosa (I was still on the New Year's diet resolution), the $15 bottomless deal would be the way to go.  The servers were all over that, making sure no one's glass was ever empty, and we had a rather large party.  No waiting for what seems an eternity, only to finally have to flag someone down, and then wait another 15 minutes past eternity to actually receive a second.  By the time you would get to a 3rd, you've needed a shower and two costume changes.  The \"flight\" of eggs benedict is pretty cool, but only if you want three.  Instead I ordered the crab, my dear wiser friend, the prosciutto.  The prosciutto was really good.  The crab, not so good in my book.  The \"jumbo lump\" crab meat was anything but.  It had more the texture and flavor of a pressed fish patty, rather than a crab cake which would have been fine.  I ended up taking the \"crab\" off and eating the rest.  But overall, I liked it, just not loving it.  Maybe another visit is in order judging by the reviews."}
{"text":"We went there earlier this week for our wedding anniversary. When we arrived, I wondered why we never noticed the restaurant before. it is right across from our favorite dessert place, The Gelato Spot. We were seated immediately, and were soon greeted by our servers. So far, so good. After perusing the menu, we started with drinks and the drunk bread. The menu described the appetizer as a swiss fondue with white wine and day old, crusty bread. To be honest, I thought it seemed more like cheesy bread you'd get at a pizza place.   Sometime between our appetizers and dinner our service took a turn. A couple sat down next to us on the patio, and appeared to know the manager and staff. They all doted over them, and gave us \"so so\" service by comparison. For instance, they attentively checked on them and chatted ever few minutes, and would stop by our table one out of every eight times they spent with the other table. What made it that much more  noticeable, was just how close our table was to theirs. When our dinner arrived, it was really quite good. I had the wood roasted half chicken and my husband had the New York strip. My meal was $19, and a ridiculously large portion. My husband's meal, was slightly more, at $32, but still well worth the money.  By the time our meal was over, we had every intention of ordering dessert.   But by the time we finished looking over the dessert menu, service had become so slow by that point we took a pass  and went to the Gelato Spot.   All in all, the food was good for a fair price. I noticed they had happy hour and weekend specials as well. I guess, being that it was our wedding anniversary my expectations were high, which made our \"meh\" service that much less acceptable to me. Our total experience was good enough that we plan on returning for the food."}
{"text":"Not bad! Not great, either. Seems as though CB opened strong last fall but is losing some of its lustre. I love the beer tap selection (Kronenbourg on tap, oh heavenly!), and the bottomless mimosas make an appealing brunch. The staff are very friendly and the servers are gracious and knowledgable. The bar staff can be aloof at times. It just seems as though they have a hard time managing peak hours, and good luck finding a place to wait while you bide your time for a table. I like that they have a decent raw bar variety (wish they could bring in more East Coast oysters but I understand the logistics behind that). I love the prosciutto pomme frites and wedge salad -- two of my favorite \"naughty dishes.\" It's a place that I like, and I'll go to when it's convenient (the fact it's a neighborhood joint is somewhat convenient), but it won't be my first choice... And I know I'm either going to have a good, somewhat neutral, experience or I might be mildly annoyed at some point by either a service or preparation element."}
{"text":"Not bad for another neighborhood walking distance to us!  Food is pretty decent, great wine list, service can be a hit or miss depending on the server.  Plus, they have a happy hour menu!    Will definitely be back, perhaps it's convenient?  Probably will not travel if it's a 30 minute drive!"}
{"text":"What an absolutely amazing experience. I was visiting from out of town and came here for lunch. Great decor, wonderful staff and very attentive service. I don't think my iced tea made it to half-glass before it was refilled without asking. I had the chicken parm sandwich. Great portion size with a nice side salad. I was thoroughly pleased with the personal service that Branden gave me. I am from a big city where the waiters usually can'y wait to get off work. This was not the case here, everyone acted as though they enjoyed working there and wanted to know how to make my experience better. I was so impressed that I returned for dinner hours later. I had the Veal Chop this time and my dining companion had the salmon. Both were cooked to perfection. And, lone and behold, Branden was our server again and he joked with us about my revisit and made the experience more enjoyable. Overall, kudos to the chef, the staff and the managers who seem to have it all together. Will look forward to revisiting soon!"}
{"text":"Central Bistro is easily located with valet but also with normal parking for regular folk like me.  The service is impeccable.  No hovering service but great attentiveness.   Have the drunk bread with prosciutto, phenomenal.  The pizza was wonderful as well, crust slightly charred and the base nice and chewy.  Will come back again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled vegetable plate upon recommendation from the waiter which was prompted when my husband and I ordered the grilled artichoke as a starter.  My husband ordered the pepperoni pizza.  Artichoke was fine but they did not offer a wet clean up towelette after finishing since they are so messy.  BUT the kicker is that the vegetable plate I ordered featured an artichoke as well and after i dived into it, realized all the vegetables were  covered in liquid smoke seasoning.  Yuk.  Why do you have to add  a smoky additive to fresh vegetables--it ruined my taste-buds for the rest of the meal.  Plus the fact that I had another artichoke ontop my main plate which was also the same as the appetizer.  Why wouldn't the waiter at least advise me that I would have duplicative food? My husband was very happy with his pizza and i tasted a bit of it (crust only) and it was very good.  Neat ambience, great location for us but I feel so-so about returning. Waiter was ok:  had to read some of the specials from a little peice of paper he had hidden in his papers and reached across my husband a couple of times versus going around to the side. I don't think he was that polished of a waiter."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in today for brunch. The menu is awesome and extensive! From small plates to big-time and everything in between this menu has something for everyone! The service was exceptional from the moment we walked in. It was not really busy and it was nice in the dining room. She had the eggs-benny Trio and chose crab, prociuto and Cali-veg which was beautiful and came with a nice side of baby spuds regular and purple with peppers and fresh rosemary. I had the chicken and waffles with sausage gravy. It was masterful! Two crispy chicken breast fillets atop a corn waffle topped with 2 eggs my style (poached soft) and the works smothered in a sinfully decadent white sausage gravy with actual ground sausage. I told our server on his quality check of our meals that should by some unfortunate circumstance I am ever condemned to death, this could be a very satisfying last meal. They also serve bottomless mimosa and 'mary's for $15 AT brunch. I was driving and opted for a nice chilly glass of blonde beer.  They had a live musician starting at noon which is a nice touch.  My wife had eaten dinner there with a group of 7 colleagues only last week and said that the food was great but the main issue, which seems to get mentioned often on Yelp is the NOISE! They need to figure out a decorative way to baffle sound in the room as when it is busy it is almost impossible to have a conversation with each other or the servers. Central Bistro Owner: Fix this and be worshiped!!! Still one of the best brunch menus around and we didn't have to spend 45min waiting like we used to at St-Francis and it's only a few blocks further east up C-back. mmmm deep-fried chicken and waffles and eggs!!! Food-Baby approves! Arteries? Not so much! Yum! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing Ambiance, Great Service, Great Food & Reasonable Prices!!!  If you are looking for casual, relaxed, tasty atmosphere this is it & enjoy!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite go-to neighborhood restaurants. I took my family there that was visiting from out of town. They sat us down at a table that had old food caked on the table that we had to ask to be wiped down. I specifically went there for their all-day Monday happy hour (which is no longer all day and they haven't updated this on the website) and was so disappointed when I saw most of the menu has changed. What was left on the menu that hadn't changed, tasted completely different. There was no more oysters, the drunken bread recipe was completely different and tasted awful (bread with tasteless burned cheese and mushrooms that were soaked in vinegar). They no longer have a few of the salads that were staples at the restaurant. I have a few friends that had similar experiences when going back after change in ownership and will probably never go back again. Why change a good thing?! So disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the ambiance here. Lots of natural light, open space... Went for brunch and got the mimosa. Took a while because they had to squeeze the oranges #fresh! Everything looked super yummy. I got the superfood salad which was a little heavy on the dressing, but still great. I am going to get the crab benny next time for sure. The waitress was nice, smiley, prompt, and helpful. The live music was charming."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the brunch here. Of course, hard not to be with $15 bottomless mimosas! Always like to indulge with an order of the donuts for the table and think it's awesome you can get a \"flight\" of eggs benedict, though I've decided the proscuitto is my favorite."}
{"text":"I surprisingly had not heard of this place before driving past and trying it out today! I am so glad I did because it was a good experience. I love how the restaurant is set up, lots of big windows and outdoor seating. Though I am sure thats not as nice when it gets hotter in the summer. But it was cute and I liked the interior! We went for brunch at 10:30ish and there were not too many people there, we were sat right away. Our server was super nice and accommodating. I loved how the water glasses were made from old wine bottles, that was a cool touch I thought. Was awesome that they noted if an item was vegetarian or gluten free or not, always super helpful. I was debating between the veggie omelette or the basic breakfast pizza. I decided to ask if I could pretty much have the best of both worlds and get veggies put on my pizza haha, and the waiter had no problem with it! My mom also asked if she could get veggies instead of meat for her two egg meal and he happily agreed. Did not even charge us extra which was nice!  Our food came out pretty quickly and it was really good! I do wish there was some type of sauce on the breakfast pizza as it was a tad dry, and the hot sauce did not help much. But the crust was absolutely incredible. My mom loved her meal as well. The potatoes she got were very tasty, I stole more than a few!  I would love to come back for another meal sometime, the 'drunk bread' sounded extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"Had you not known that this used to be Zen 32, you'd have no idea.  I have been back several times now waiting and hoping that all of the kinks would be worked out.  For HH's stick with the outside patios, the interior really is not equipped to deal with a group of folks (they'll kindly put you at a long table to try to accommodate, but it doesn't really work).  The food is well....okay.  I love the fact that they are open late.  (Midnight and ten p.m. on Sunday)  The HH specials are decent,  but nothing on the food menu really pops.  The ingredients are fresh, but the execution lacks enthusiasm.  Example:  Huge shrimp, cooked to the point of being beyond rubbery but actually tasteless in the cioppino.   The interior is exposed brick, casual meets upscale.  (I'm not sure that is a word but think exposed brick with fancy pendant lights).  They might be going after the same market as Hillstone, but the food isn't quite as reliable or steakhouse accessible.  The staff is friendly and tries hard.  (One knock, being charged 2.95 cents for soda water)  Overall, I prefer the drink experience to the dinner experience.  I'm still waiting for the food to catch up to the surroundings."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant! The difference between other buildings catches the eye of a driver in passing. Had Heirloom Tomato Salad, Tuna Tart Tare, Local Burrata, Central Mac and Cheese, Cool Roasted Beets, and Thai Steak Salad. Everything tasted delicious and had somewhat of a \"refreshing\" taste as well! Talented chef for sure! Definitely would return!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Mariah Carey & Miguel - Beautiful)  Hop on the front of the bar Let the good drinks flow in your mouth With a menu like that and so I smile so bright Oh, you're killing me, you know it ain't fair, yeah Ride on through the middle of the night Let the HH drinks kiss my lips When you cook like that, your service so right Oh, you're killing me, baby do it again  The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah The Central Bistro, and my mind is on the Central Bistro And I can Yelp cause it means a thing to me, to me, yeah yeah  The Central Bistro is located offsite from the hectic Biltmore traffic which I can appreciate.  I love coming here I guess that's what I'm trying to say.  Never too crowded and the food is awesome.    I always come for HH or as they like to call it \"Social Hour\", great drink and food specials and they even do reverse HH or reverse \"Social Hour\"; whatever!  Never the less, it's sweet!  I love the proscuitto melon pizza here!  Not too cheesy and just the right amount of blend or salty cured meat while the melon mellos it out!  At half price during \"Social Hour\" -- POW! Give me 2!  Drink specials are generally $1 off beers and assortment of small bites.  Perfect for any budget you're coming with.  Again, if you miss our early for Social Hour.  No worries, Central Bistro opens late for reverse Social Hour!  Yah for Social Hour! -- Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be back - would love to do a happy hour and dinner.  Came for lunch, great space, service & food.  Server made great suggestions - all stellar!  Started with grilled artichokes (huge & great wood fired taste) and tuna tartare.  Shared burrata salad (fab flavor & texture) and the scallop risotto (a mind blower).  Want to do it all over again but with a cocktail first and big glass of wine with it - only way it could get better."}
{"text":"Went there with one of the tradespeople I used, using my Passport dining card.    I had the smoked salmon cobb salad, and she had the drunk bread.   The server, Anthony, old me the buttermilk dressing it came with has goat cheese in it.    UGHH!   Do NOT get me anywhere near goat cheese.    He suggested substituting their lemon vinaigrette, and it was perfecto!   The salad has the right combination of bacon, avocado, tomato, egg, with a decorative display of salmon.   Of course, it included lettuce.    I loved it!   Her drunk bread did look good, albeit I didn't taste it.    As I remember, it had cheese and mushrooms, and I don't remember what else, and sat atop a large piece of bread.    If I liked bread, I probably would order it.   She really liked it.   Our server was very helpful and efficient and gave us professional service.  I would definitely return.    I see they have happy hour.   I would need to check out their HH specials."}
{"text":"I was jonesing for a late night glass of wine and some food so I popped in here for reverse Happy Hour. I like what they've done with the place. The bar area reminds me just a little of Side Bar but with more seating and open bay windows that let the nice (and soon to be a distant memory) cool evening breeze in. They were playing pretty good mellow tunes so well done on the atmosphere.  Their Happy Hour menu has a nice offering of flat breads (I had the mushroom which was pretty tasty), wings and other snacks. I also had the Prosciutto Wrapped Truffle Fries which I expected to be stellar.....not so much. Not bad but those of you who have been to Rome and spent three minutes staring at the ceiling of The Sistine Chapel know what I'm talking about!  I was impressed by their drink menu, particularly their wine offerings which have a \"Good, Better, Best\" offering which are all priced accordingly. I was very happy with their \"Best\" Pinot Noir. Their beer taps have a good variety. The guy tending bar was enthusiastic and took care of me.   What put a bit of a damper on my evening is that I had the misfortune of sitting next to (for those of you who have seen \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\")52-year-old, worked-his-way-up-to-head-waiter Brad Hamilton. This guy was loud and talked and talked to his industry colleague, sharing his wealth of knowledge on the service industry, careful to constantly boast his credentials. I wanted to turn to the guy and say \"Arnold, you want to work at All-American Burger\" So this guy utterly killed the cool vibe that I was trying to absorb, so much so that I chose not to linger for another glass of the awesome pinot noir. Not the restaurants fault by geeze.  So Brad notwithstanding, I like this place. I'm pretty much bound to enjoy any place where I can have a good glass of wine late at night at a reasonable price. I'm not really a brunch guy but this place screams brunch to me for some reason. Their regular menu looks good too so I'll be back to check it out again."}
{"text":"Fantastic day Saturday for lunch at Central Bistro.  The doors were all open and the breeze and light from outside were wonderful.  My lobster bisque was great and the burger hit the spot.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"We have always loved stopping by Central Bistro with friends and family for great food (brunch), exceptional service, and nice music! Unfortunately, we had arrived with friends in tow & realized the menu was completely limited.. We had nothing to choose from! The menu was so horrible we took our business elsewhere & we definitely won't return. The live music & wide variety for brunch was something not many offer. Central Bistro is now just another restaurant with a lacking menu, not the kindest staff, and there was no music."}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for ok food and be waited on confused staff who moves around your place setting about 6 times then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Very good food, very good wait staff, including Chris the manager and Hurley (yes like the clothing line) the bartender.   Must MUST come and try if you haven't tried. This is my first time here and I sure will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my husband & my first time. Amazing! I had the scallop risotto. It was cooked perfect. We got the bread pudding for dessert which was so yummy & sweet. For first time, they also give you a sample dessert. The manager came out to check on us & our server was so friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Chicken and waffles...spot on amazing. Add a Bloody Mary and you're in for a happy Sunday. Strong work!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a quick lunch by myself or meet with friends. Service is always top notch, and I LOVE the artichokes!!! Plus, it's around the corner from where I work, and they have a happy hour that starts at 2! And yes, my artichokes are on the happy hour menu. Love this place!  Other things to know are that they provide free wifi, and even though it may seem like it's loud when you walk in, once seated, it doesn't feel that way. :)"}
{"text":"We thought we would return to Central Bistro for their oysters, tuna sashimi and absolutely astonishing scallop sashimi.  We were floored when we sat down and got the new menu.  None of our favorites were still listed,  just rather common choices.  LOTS of pasta dishes offered,  and some entrees that were on the expensive side.  We eat out a lot,  and this didn't get our vote.  We got up and left.... hadn't even seen a wait person.....   Sorry, Central Bistro - but I think you are being removed as a favorite place of ours!!  Good luck w/your new,  but predictable menu."}
{"text":"Open atmosphere w/a light and bright feel to it. Came in for lunch today and first thing was that they have $2 off a glass of wine on Mondays - well if that doesn't start things off right, what would?!? :)  Service was friendly and timely - and I ordered the summer salad w/some grilled chicken - salad was tasty, liked the corn, and the chicken was done well too, just lightly seasoned. Overall, with the PGrigio and salad, I had the perfect fall lunch."}
{"text":"I had HH here with Irene V., Anna M., and Dave H.- they all had the oysters and loved it. I had their arugula sausage pizza and also loved it. Anna M. loved her orange vodka drink as did the others. I had water and was not given the side slay glare- in fact the bar tender was very nice and kept my water glass full. Seems like a popular after work business people crowd.  Love the location a bit out of my hood but worth the drive for the HH and to hang & chat with some of my Yelp friends!"}
{"text":"Went to the soft open and loved the experience! Great portions, excellent atmosphere, knowledgable wait staff, beautiful space! Had the wood fired octopus ( perfectly cooked and seasoned) and the lobster Mac n cheese ( I died and went to heaven)! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Since opening I have hosted guests and had dinner at this place numerous times.  The décor and atmosphere are excellent.  The CB also fills a much needed niche in the Biltmore area for more late night dining options.  Courteous and attentive staff...decent food overall and a great wine & spirit selection.  Highlights are the duck orange and shrimp cocktail.  The cheese board with prosciutto with accoutrements was extremely generous...to the point where I actually told the waiter that they would never stay in business giving servings like that.  This restaurant is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Always a winner. Went for brunch yesterday... Great atmosphere (Live music), great food and wonderful service. You can never go wrong...lunch, dinner or brunch. You will see me soon again! Thanks."}
{"text":"If I had submitted a review for this place when they first opened, it would not have gotten 1 star. This is my neighborhood hang out area and I tried them twice before, and I had to just walk away. A few months ago I thought I would try the \"three strikes your out\" rule and give them one more try. I have been over a dozen times in the last few months and so far they can do nothing wrong. The Burrata and Blistered Padron Peppers are amazing. A must for any foodie in the Valley of the Sun. And a shout out to Katie, the best bartender around."}
{"text":"I love this place for breakfast and lunch, hands down one of the better places in greater Phoenix. The service is awesome, the selection of beers is great, sitting at the bar is easy and the food is amazing (plus they have one hell of a hipster twist on Chicken & Waffles). The only downside is the price, and I think their dinner menu could use a bit more selection; and last time I came here for dinner I enjoyed my salmon but was not a big fan of the gnocchi. I would say it's a 4 star place, but the decor and service pushes it up to at least a 4.5 star."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolute delight. The first thing you notice is that all the young ladies are very pretty, from the hostesses to the bartender to the servers, each dressed very elegantly for a Sunday morning. The service was excellent, as we were very well attended to by Alex. The bottomless Bloody Mary's are spicy and delicious. What can I say about the food? It was amazing and plentiful. I had the Eggs Benedict Oscar, a wonderful take on an old standard that used lump crab meat and asparagus instead of Canadian bacon. My wife had the blueberry corn pancakes, 3 huge cakes the size of large dinner plates, and they were to die for. Our friends had a salmon omelette and NY-style bagel & lox, both dishes large enough to allow us to skip lunch. The ambience of the restaurant was fantastic, and having a live 2-person band was a nice touch. By 11:30 am the entire bistro was packed, indoors and outdoors, both at the tables and at the bar. This place is not to be missed."}
{"text":"We had dinner here for the first time last weekend and the roasted chicken was to die for.  My husband said his steak salad was average.  But the wine list was impressive.  Really good wines at good prices.  I love that they don't try to gouge their customers on the wine.  So we ordered an extra bottle!  It was pretty noisy on a Saturday night which was the one down side.  But I loved the vibe, the location and the valet parking at this busy location. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"great food... went with the family for my dads birthday. loved the look of the place and the food was delicious... its the same as Local Bistro which is closer to our house however if we are in the neighborhood then we would stop by again"}
{"text":"Wow...what a great find here. Came here on a Sunday late afternoon, open patio, TV's with football games on, just a real inviting atmosphere.  We have friends that live down the street, so they took us here.  Lucky for us it was happy hour.  Great price on beer & wine and a nice happy hour menu.  Service was great at the bar area.  We came late afternoon on a Sunday during football season, seem like a local hang out, not too many patrons, so it was very comfortable.  The weather was absolutely beautiful so the open patio was great.   Our friend who lives in the vicinity suggested this place...as they have been here a few times.  They loved the service and the food....can't blame them now...and it's just around their corner."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and beautifully decorated.  We were attended to quickly during the happy hour.  We ordered a meat and cheese plate, 2 pizzas and roasted artichoke.  The pizzas chosen were chicken and pesto and the wild mushroom.  I was disappointed with the wild mushroom pizza.  The white pizza flavor was lacking as well as the mushrooms.  The pizza was lukewarm at best and became chewy very quickly.  On a good note, the chick/pesto pizza was tasty with the arugula.  The artichoke was delicious and our friend was happy with her meat/cheese plate.  The server was nice and attentive.  He offered separate checks or one check which I thought was a nice touch.   The place was packed by the time we left.  Looks like a popular hot spot."}
{"text":"My favorite local hot spot.  I've been coming here since they opened.  Great atmosphere, delicious food, tasty cocktails, excellent service & friendly management and good prices.    Love the happy hour menu all day Mondays.  The artichoke is tender and seasoned perfectly on the grill.  Great oyster platter.  Half price pizzas - the wild mushroom is my favorite.  I've been on a charcuterie kick - awesome value for all the meats, cheeses and lil fixings.  Love the frozen grapes, tomato jam, pickled cucumbers, focaccia, fresh garlic & more..... Yum!!   I've had almost everything on the lunch & dinner menu.... Delicious salads, great portions and they'll be happy to substitute for certain food allergies.  The lunch wraps are healthy light, yet filling.  For dinner, I love the pasta dishes, but if I'm trying to eat healthier, I'll order the scallops, salmon, steak or chicken - all winners!    Then, I'll do their bread pudding for dessert  or cobbler when in season!    I haven't even gotten to their brunch!  Monkey bread, yum, pancakes, yum, salmon omelette,.... And my fav is the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice w pulp!  Greyhounds, yes!!  Plus very good wine selection.     Hands down my favorite place.  Go say hi to GM Paul, Bill, server Tom, bartender Hurley and Justin.  Thanks German and team.... I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service, wonderful food, beautiful ambiance. One of Phoenix's best restaurants. I'm quickly becoming a regular. :-) that's not easy for me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and best Eggs Benedict in Arcadia"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Central Bistro since it opened. Last night my husband took me there for a belated birthday dinner. It was a \"splurge\" meal for us, as the price point here is not extravagant but is definitely in the once-in-a-while range for us. We booked a reservation through Open Table thinking that a beautiful Arizona evening in March might mean it was crowded. The hostesses sat us immediately, and the dining room was definitely not crowded at our 6 pm dinner time. I wanted some indulge-y carbs, so I ordered the pasta bolognese and my husband had the filet, which came with potatoes and asparagus. Everything was just perfect, though I might say that the frequency of check-ins by wait staff and managers was a little too much. I felt like they checked on us after every bite. The steak is on my husband's short list of best steaks he's had (order it medium rare). Though we passed on dessert, they brought us warm chocolate chip cookies and milk to thank us for our first visit to Central Bistro. This place is now top of the list for \"special dinner destinations\" for me."}
{"text":"I LOVED this restaurant. I have been here a few times and I have really had an opportunity to explore the menu from drinks to food. I think it is absolutely amazing. The staff was friendly and not overbearing, kept on top of drinks w/o being to forceful about getting another and the food was so good upon each visit. The décor and bathroom set up are so fun! I really enjoyed this place and I HOPE they are open for years to come."}
{"text":"Went with friends and the service was attentive and the food tasty.  One of our party had an allergic reaction to something she was served - enough so that one of went to the CVS nearby and retrieved some antihistamine.  when we asked for a list of ingredients we were assured that we would be contacted but 3 follow up attempts have resulted in nothing.  Not sure if they think we're trying to steal their cooking secrets or what.  Kind of a sidebar story but it did put a bit of a damper on our impression of how the place is run."}
{"text":"Went for a business lunch. Great place, fresh atmosphere. I ordered the steak salad. It was okay but my colleague ordered the mushroom risotto and I had major food envy! I tried it and it was delicious! I'm getting that next time! We also ordered the drunken bread, which was awesome but not a good choice if you are on any kind of diet!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for dinner and just had a great time. Everyone was very attentive and the food was nicely prepared. Had the roasted Padrone peppers which were excellent. The Friday night crowd was in full swing. Despite the full bar the manager still took the time to ask how was the dinner and service."}
{"text":"We had great food, fun music, and great service.  I had the corn pancakes with blueberries, and a cup of coffee.  I was so happy....and the people with me were happy with their breakfast orders as well.  The music was nice in a Flight of the Conchords sort of way..but not as funny...just nice.   Admittedly, I went there because the Henry was tooooo full and a total zoo.  'So glad I did."}
{"text":"New Owners......BAD menu. Very very disappointed. The previous owners had such a great menu, the best happy hour in Phoenix. We dined several times a month for years. It was our go to spot.   The new menu is all italiian! Antipasti, Secondi etc....Not that I have anything against Italian but how can you call a restaurant \"central bistro\" and serve Italian fare?   We will miss the oysters, the CB burger, their superfood salad and their Saturday Sunday bruch.   Sadly we left after seeing the new menu and nothing appealed. We will have to find a new local fave as this is surely not what it used to be. I feel awful for the wonderful staff who served us for years...  To the new owners, shame on you for changing what was once a great place to be with great food, great staff, and countless good times. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great brunch experience today! Music a tad too loud but when we told our server Rodney he asked for the speakers to be adjusted; good music however. I would come back for the bottomless mimosas, food and for our awesome service. Thanks Rodney!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant and the food was really amazing. Totally exceeded my expectations. Staff was really friendly and helpful and I'm sure will just keep getting better the longer they are open. Started with the steak tartare which was really light and came with a really amazing potato chip/waffle fry. The croque madame sandwich was ridiculous. So good. Also had the truffled mushroom pizza which was cooked in a Neapolitan style wood fired oven and also was amazing. This place has great food and a great ambiance. I will be their often.."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is beautiful. It looks great! The service was good, and our server was very nice. We had a bowl of French onion soup, which was delicious and the artichoke appetizer, also very good. They have an awesome wine collection by the glass and the bottle and some interesting cocktails I want to try next time. The only complaint is I had prawn and scallop entree and it was served over pasta. The pasta was ridiculously over cooked, I could tell as soon as she set the plate down. It was almost turning to mush. It was also very heavily seasoned but I couldn't put finger on exactly which seasoning it was. It was a little strange. All in all, a great new restaurant for the neighborhood. We probably will skip entrees next time, maybe just get the appetizers and some wine."}
{"text":"First of all, I loved the atmosphere, the decoration, and the music. Very fresh but at the same time with a touch of fanciness. As an entree I order the ricotta tortellini plate.   Main ingredients: sweet corn sauce, ricotta, jalapeño slices along with grape tomatoes. Sounds good right?, well I was even more surprised when I took the first bite, it tasted so good! There was a key ingredient inside the ricotta: lemon zest! It complement so well with the sweet corn sauce. My compliments to the creator of this plate!   Our server Lisa was amazing, she had very good suggestions and made me feel special with her service. It was our first time in this restaurant, and we will be definitely coming back with more people. Thumbs up Lisa, thank you!  FYI: they have live music on Sundays!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at Central Bistro. Our server, Danielle, recommended a fabulous Pinot Noir that was very reasonably priced and that set the mood for a great evening. Danielle was fantastic by the way!  The scallop risotto & macaroni were fantastic. But we fell in love with the housemate salumi patte and when we inquired about it, the chef himself came out! What an incredible & personable treat that was.   All in all, this experience was a dining endeavor I'd like to relive again and again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very tasty lunch at Central Bistro.   Place was clean, staff was quick , courteous and friendly.    The \"Cubano\" sandwich was delicious, along with the truffle fries... only better topped off by the red cherry bellini.... I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I use to love this place, went multiple times to the other restaurants and always had a great time. When we visited this time we noticed a difference in the menu, we asked the waitress why the change and she mentioned that the restaurant is under new management/ownership. The new brunch menu is pretty limited maybe around 10 items, some of which you wouldn't even consider for brunch - I mean a burger for brunch?!   I ordered the 2 eggs, bacon, sausage and potatoes, when it arrived it was pathetic - it was almost laughable, I thought it was a setup, now if your going to offer such limited selection you should at least nail those dishes, in all honesty I could have cooked something better at home (seriously take a look at the pic), the best part there was no toast with my eggs not even an offer of an english muffin, after my complaint about the size of the breakfast and not having toast - the server did bring an english muffin out and an extra side of sausage.   I would give this 1 star, but the place/location and servers are the only thing pushing it to a two star rating, out of the 6 of us that ate we probably had 3 happy with their meals, on a plus note the picture of the breakfast also gave some of my friends hours of laughs later.  I won't be rushing back to this location, will stick with Local Bistro in Grayhawk."}
{"text":"This has been our \"go to\" place since they opened. Stellar food and service has always brought us back so the disappointment in our food today came as a real shock. I ordered the Oscar eggs Benedict which was supposed to be lump crab and asparagus. The crab cake was about a third the size of the English muffin and wafer thin. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that there was crab in there. I had 5, one inch or less, pieces of asparagus on the plate and it all came out luke warm. I love this place and will come back with the hope that someone in the kitchen was just having a bad day today..."}
{"text":"We swung by Central Bistro due to our original choice being unexpectedly closed for a private party. I've passed by this place constantly and it's been bookmarked for quite some time. It looks to be fairly popular, so we took a risk.    Unfortunately, it's a risk that didn't pay off.  The décor itself is quite nice, with their exposed brick and sleek looking designs. It looks like the perfect type of restaurant to satisfy the \"wino\" crowd, although a bit too manufactured to really be considered a warm place of gathering.  I wish I had more good things to say about this place, but I'm really struggling here.  Service at this restaurant was very poor. I'm not sure if our guy lacked experience, was having an off day, or had simply been serving for one too many years. I asked for a Diet Coke. I received an iced tea. When our appetizer came out, I politely asked again for my Diet Coke. Almost a half hour goes by and I never receive it. I was seconds away from entering the kitchen myself, possibly wondering if requesting a basic soda was just asking too much of this establishment - until our actual dinner was brought out by someone else. Thankfully, my third request was granted fairly quickly. 30 minutes for a soda? Ouch!  We opted for some bread as an appetizer, which I'm pretty sure is just their \"drunk bread\" in its naked form with some olive oil. It was okay, but we probably should have opted for a \"drunk\" variation. Oh well.  For dinner, we had the taglietelle bolognese. Since we were splitting it, they were kind enough to serve it in two separate dishes, which was one of the few things I do give them some credit for. The pasta was okay, although you don't have to drive too far to find the identical entrée in superior forms.  We then ordered a margherita as a baseline to see how their pizza holds up. They did not describe the margherita on the menu, simply stating it's the \"classic.\" Well, apparently, their idea of a margherita vastly differs from ours. We've eaten enough margheritas over the last few years to feed a small Italian village and this is the only one that uses marinara instead of traditional tomato sauce. Why? Did they run out of tomato sauce? Are they trying to bend the rules? Or did the chef simply perform a botch-job on the most basic of all pizza pies?  The crust's flavor was practically nonexistent. I would try some of their other pizzas, but if you can't do a margherita right, I'm pretty sure there's not much that you CAN do right when you're dabbling in pizza.  For dessert, we opted for the German chocolate cake, which ended up being a disappointment. Its consistency was similar to those dry dessert cakes that they often serve at chain restaurants, a red flag that it probably wasn't made recently. The coconut-pecan frosting that is a staple of all German chocolate cakes was conspicuously absent, replaced with something that was more similar to pudding.  I originally overlooked their unisex restrooms and ended up using their ghastly designed urinal room that is closed off by nothing beyond a couple of swinging saloon doors. Considering I'm just several feet away from kitchen staff and other customers, it's a mere step up from just holding up a protective sheet for privacy while I pee in front of all the patrons.  I'm sorry. Too many disappointments to give them a second chance and too many other options to really consider this place worth revisiting, despite the fact that they have a breakfast menu that I'll probably never try.  Not recommended!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and have never been disappointed. The food is consistent and imaginative and the service is efficient and helpful"}
{"text":"Amazing, unexpected experience. We we're attending an event and afterward  in need of a snack. We stopped here without checking Yelp first. Risky. Great risk occasionally equals great reward. Service was attentive, informative and friendly. Thank you to our server Brian. The homemade burrata the best I've had (and I always I try it) with roasted Brussel sprouts, chili and apple. Beet salad was fresh and light. The produce was fresh and each dish beautifully presented. It was our first time so we were treated to a complimentary dish of fresh baked chocolate chip cookies and warm milk infused with vanilla. I will return."}
{"text":"I went with a large group of people and we were seated on the outdoor area.  I will say that yes, we did have a large group, but the service was terrible.  It was an unorganized mess.  I realize we had a large group, but that is their job - to provide service.  3 members of the waitstaff ran around taking orders. Unfortunately they couldn't seem to keep up with who waited on who.  Twice I had to place a drink order with two different people , who each came back several times to ask what kind of wine I ordered.  One of my friends ordered a glass of wine and had to be asked three times, by two separate people, what she ordered. When it came time to get the checks... I had to ask 3 times.  It was a hot mess. I will say, I ordered the Bacon Flatbread and it was delicious.  Unfortunately the service was unorganized and this is definitely not a place to take large groups."}
{"text":"Simply the best, mind blowing, and delicious!  My friends and I live for the artichokes and the burrata. The oysters are always on point. When the burrata with brussel sprouts are in season we each get our own, way to amazing to share. The burrata with fried green tomatoes will do for now. This is my favorite spot for HH.  Would recommend to anyone since the menu has everything - can be pricey - but totally worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favs in the valley. Breakfast, lunch or dinner this place brings its A game! This place is a must try. The scallops and risotto are everything!"}
{"text":"Short rib pasta was good and my wife enjoyed the pork tenderloin. I like that the menu hits all price levels, starting with a hamburger- pizza-pasta-steaks.    Really happy this place opened in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Last night my husband, daughter and I went to Central Bistro for the first time (my husband and I live in Tucson). We were greeted by a lovely hostess and seated early, unfortunately that was the highlight of our evening. The waiter was also delightful, however the first three drinks that our daughter ordered they did not have. My husband then ordered wine, three different times the waiter came back to the table to say that they were out of the wine ordered. The last time we were told 'oh is that wine still on the list, it shouldn't be as we don't carry it any longer'.   Next we had our appetizer and the tuna tartare had wasabi which took away any ability to really taste it. Of our three main courses the roasted chicken and the Chilean sea bass were great, the pork tenderloin was over-cooked and very small (all of the plates were very uninteresting in presentation). Dessert was the six layer chocolate cake which we could not even get our fork into (it was either stale or just bad). The waiter came back after taking it away and said 'the chef thought it was a bit dry'.  We would have felt a lot better if the Manager had come over and spoken with us. Alas we won't go back."}
{"text":"09/29/13  I had to wait till Restaurant Week was over to visit and use my expiring Local Dines certificate here.  (Perhaps I'll try CB on a future RW.)  This restaurant has such a great atmosphere-- I would hate to see it close down... I stopped by after work (around 815p), and there were maybe only eight diners there, including me.  :(  I'm sorry to say I forget the server's name, but he was friendly and helpful- another plus.  (I was fortunate to attend a Gatsby-themed event here earlier in the year, and I was very impressed with the welcome and great treatment we were given here.  The atmosphere was very fun, and the open sight lines (open kitchen, bar, wine closets, restroom areas, and design of the restaurant were perfect for the occasion!)  I'd look for him when I visit again, but something tells me that everyone here know how to treat guests well.  I really do hope to see a busier CB in the future!  Enough about the atmosphere and service already and let's get to the food!  I decided I'd order the $13 Purple Potato pizza (mozz, gorgonzola, purple potato, leeks, bacon) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=Q1VQ6HI7G_wLhQ5ghdK08g#Q1VQ6HI7G_wLhQ5ghdK08g, $12 Central Burger (fried shoestring onions, gruyere, and frites) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=Xb1125wtIn3jpIFzFBfnJg#Xb1125wtIn3jpIFzFBfnJg, and $10 Chocolate Layer Cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=eI3Br0fwcAyN1yBk3I1CFA#eI3Br0fwcAyN1yBk3I1CFA  First, I must say that everything I tasted was, yes, amazing!  I believe that this was the second time I've ever had potatoes on a pizza, and as was the case with my first experience, I find potatoes on a pizza to be quite a game-changer!  This pizza was gorgeous-- I loved the colorful impact that the purple potatoes gave to the pizza, and, even more importantly, the foodorgasms I'd fall blissfully into with every violaceous bite! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/central-bistro-phoenix-2?select=e_DOX2w9XRpbNE6uF3m1ng#e_DOX2w9XRpbNE6uF3m1ng  The gorgonzola and bacon pairing just pushed this pizza over-the-edge... A definite must-try!  (This pizza also reheats very well.)  The burger was also a terrific find-- the patty was cooked to a perfect medium (red center) and very juicy and so flavorful, the gruyere creamy and luscious.  My only complaints were that the onion shoestrings were unnecessary, and the fries were presented in the style of frites, which means if you don't forget to gently slide them out of the receptacle and onto some paper napkins, you'll end up with a soggy mess in under two minutes.  The challah bun was a great pairing, as well.  All in all, two delectable meals.  Speaking of meals, the chocolate layer cake could be three meals by itself!  This six-layer cake was colossal and sat on top of what surprisingly looked and felt like the consistency of room-temperature evaporated milk, and tasted like it, too- a slight disappointment.  A bigger drag was that it was served cold, and therefore not as flavorful as it could've been.  Please don't misunderstand- the few bites I had were appetizing, but not as palatable as the bites of leftovers I had in the days after.  A big win was the dollop of creme fraiche on top, with garnishes of blueberries, sliced strawberries, and mint.  I'd order this again, to come out with the entrees (to allow to warm up to room temp), and share with others.  Can't wait to go back for more scrumptious food, maybe some wine, good service, and to enjoy the inviting and beautiful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. The food was great and the service spectacular.  Make sure you ask for Kara N. (yes there are 2 Kara's )."}
{"text":"I have only been here once, but I love it already. My husband and I stopped in at 10:00 p.m. one Thursday for a quick, light bite and a drink.  The menu is fantastic, and the food and drinks we ordered were great. It's very lovely on the inside, has a huge amount of square footage, and has a very cool restroom set-up (kind of like Christopher's).  When are wonderful waiter found out this was our first time there, he arranged to have a complimentary dessert brought to the table -- nice finishing touch."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We had a gift card so we made it a date night.  The place is cool, right off of Camelback. Nice outdoor seating and very modern. CLEAN - which is nice. The bathrooms are clean and cool since you walk through their wine cooler or cellar thing - lots to see so that was cool. They have a big dining area as well as a cool bar area where we sat.   I forget our guys name but he was nice and didn't seem like he was trying too hard which I always appreciate. We arrived during happy hour and got a couple of glasses of wine and the french fries...they are called frites on the menu and they come with prosciutto, Parmesan and truffle oil on top. You may think they are just fries but they are really good and an awesome menu for the happy hour menu. The small plates are all $5 which rocks and whats even cooler is the happy our wine list...you get to choose from a few different lists that range from $5-$10 cheap to expensive (they are pretty expensive on the regular list so thats a great deal!).  We also had the grilled artichokes as our app. We loved them - perfectly cooked, not overwhelming in the smokiness and the sauce was nice and simple (considering we usually just use mayo -any sauce is cool for us).  I will have to go back and get the orange duck - I was really hard pressed between that and the shrimp big plate. I went with the shrimp which was awesome. Pictures to follow. If you are squeamish, buyer beware -you have to shell one big shrimp. I was no afraid since I am an east coast girl and grew up with lobsters. The risotto was my favorite because the flavor was great and there were even more shrimp tucked in there! I couldn't believe I got 3 large shrimp, 1 massive and then at least 30 pieces in my rice as well. Awesome!!!  Boyfriend got the pork loin which was great too. Definitely suggest that. I think we played it safe a bit so I want to go back and get more and we definitely will soon.  OH! FYI - when they say \"big plate\" on the menu....they mean BIG PLATE - totally worth the money."}
{"text":"We were graced with having Chris as our server, I would like to say he is more like a tour guide.  Not only was he very well versed in the menu, he was a gem to talk with through out the evening.  We had the seafood tower to start, and we had the \"small\" one. Holy Cow it was HUGE!  Some of the best sea food I've had outside of the islands.  We also enjoyed the truffle frites as a \"small plate\" and it was huge as well.  We finessed with dessert.  We never made it to the entrees because we were so full.  The cocktails are great, nice wine list.  Super friendly staff.  I would come back to Phoenix just to dine here."}
{"text":"Over priced, small servings and no bread or crackers served with salads. NEVER TO RETURN!"}
{"text":"Went here with a large group (14 people) with an existing reservation. The table was, nicely, already put together when we arrived. However, it was right next to the bar (where there was evidently still happy hour going on), which made for a loud, raucous dining experience (with a couple TVs on in the background to boot).  We split some appetizers as a group. I tried both the artichoke and the kale salad. The artichoke was excellent (although there was *a lot* of it, definitely enough for 5-6 people to comfortably share) while the kale salad was very citrus-y, to an almost overpowering degree.  I had the Linguine and Clams, as did one other person in the party. Avoid this at all costs. It was BAD. It basically tasted like linguine drenched in clam juice and saltwater. Very little seasoning (or other flavor) to speak of. And while the clams were already removed from their shells, around a half dozen *empty* clam shells were added to the dish (I can only assume for presentation purposes?). Other people had the Crispy Seared Salmon, which I tried; by all accounts it was excellent.  An annoying issue (given the colder weather - around 50 degrees) was that the front door kept sticking open, giving one end of the table a rather brisk breeze. Even after bringing this to the attention of the waiter and, eventually, the manager, it continued to be a problem.   Overall, a very hit-or-miss experience, and not quite worth the price paid, especially given some of the other options nearby."}
{"text":"This place is so good from the food to the management to the wait staff to bar service. Best pasta, pizza, charcuterie plate and so much more. Don't want to sound like a commercial but I really don't mind paying back Anthony, Tony, Chris and Nina. We drive here from LA and look fwd to all the above. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"I live in the Central Corridor and had yet to try out this restaurant but am so glad my husband and I went there.  This was the most amazing experience.  I love the location, building, ambiance, service and most of all their food.  My husband and I split the Pork Scallopini Marsala which was incredible.  Their desserts are to die for, I had the Banana Bread Pudding and my hubby had the German chocolate cake..........both very, very good.  Our experience was so great we went back three days later and will be going again very soon.  Cannot say enough about Chris the Floor Manager... AWESOME and our servicer, Emmy (what a sweetie) who provided excellent service. The Central Bistro in my opinion was overall OUTSTANDING!!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is great for their happy hour plates and happy hour drinks.  Oysters are really good I prefer East coast flavor even though their smaller.  I also like how the pizzas are half price during happy hour. I recommend the vegetable board it's perfectly char grilled.  I like ordering the well cocktails.  I've tried an actual entree only once and it was tasty but the portion was way too small to share with someone else and I love sharing."}
{"text":"Please bring back normal food when you re-open. The yogurt parfait and the pizza. No more fancy stuff that people can't pronounce without a culinary degree.  Why ruin a good thing? The menu for happy hour has completed changed. My husband and I loved walking over for happy hour because they had 1/2 priced pizzas - now that's gone. Hoping they bring it back soon."}
{"text":"Brunch anyone?    It's interesting to me that they have a young attractive man with a low button shirt as a host and a young lady as the bartender.  My waiter was attentive and I was starving that I ordered CB's Chicken and Waffles plate.  The entree is huge that two people can share the entree.    The corn waffle was piled with two huge chicken pieces fried.  The sausage and gravy and scrambled eggs on top.  An overwhelming amount of fennel and spice was  the main flavors of the dish.  I wasn't a big fan of the waffle which was on the bottom of everything.  It became soft, yet not soggy.  I think next time I would get it on the side and just a plain waffle.  I tasted peppercorn more than anything of the waffle.   The entree was $15 and the coffee was $5.  I don't think this will be my normal brunch hangout, but once in  a while , will be a treat.  Next I will have to try the Trio eggs bene!"}
{"text":"Stephanie was absolutely fantastic. This was our first time here and we will 100% be coming back. Thank you for such excellent service!  PS. The bacon is AMAZING"}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent padron peppers - we even ordered a third. Great grilled artichoke too, as well as the burrata salad, pastas, and desert selection."}
{"text":"We decided to try this for brunch because... Mimosas! I They were very nice, with fresh squeezed orange juice and were $15 with one cent refills.   The peasant potatoes were fingerlings fried with peppers and onions and we're incredible. My California Benedict was amazing with lemon thyme hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. The English muffin had just the right amount of crispness without being hard to cut. My husband loved his veggie omelet. The wood grilled veggies were delicious.   Our service was impeccable, and we even called the manager over to compliment their bussers, who showed a higher level of dedication and pride in their work than I've seen in a long time.   I give 4 stars instead of 5 because it got a bit loud after it got more crowded, and we felt the prices were a little high."}
{"text":"The hostess wasEXTREMELY RUDE she looked at me as if I was lost.I informed her I did not have a reservation,she said the wait was going to be 30to40 minutes,and she made it very clearthe 3course meal was going to be about$65.00 or more. What the f%& do I look broke to you?I told her I will wait(she looked shocked)as we waited 50minutes and 5 couples that arrived after we didwith NO RESERVATIONS get seated before us, I lost it. My husband knows the owner and saw him sitting at the bar went up to him and informed him we had been waiting 45 minutes and we had watched 5 couples with NO RESERVATIONS get seated before us; the owner apologized and sat us right away also gave me a coupon for free earrings at a nearby jewelry store. I left the coupon. I will never go back. Tip: if you are Mexican like us dress as if you were going to meet the President of the United States. Seriously!"}
{"text":"central grease-stro.  nuff said."}
{"text":"Bottomless Mimosas and a french toast that resembles bricks of delicious gold.   My first experience in this place was earlier today for post brunch-bunch. (Yeah, I'm the type of person that spends the entire day brunching)   First off, the aesthetics in this place are wonderful.  A solid improvement from zen32 in my opinion.  A large open dining area lined with exposed brick and a well lit / inviting bar area.  Their menu seemed to cover all of the important bases, for breakfast the have the staples of steak and eggs, french toast, etc - but also offer a chicken and waffles option.  All in all, the prices seem to be very reasonable.  The specials looked amazing, and I will definitely be coming back to sample their social hour."}
{"text":"I went to Central Bistro last night with friends who had been there before and as someone posted before, it was a mix of good and bad.  The good: The Wood Grilled Artichoke is simply outstanding as an appetizer The Sidecar that I ordered from the bar was well made The Farm Salad was dressed in a very good vinaigrette  The bad: I waited forever to place a drink order, ignored for nearly 15 minutes They brought a bottle of water to the table, and no ice. I asked for ice later, because they don't replace the water with cold so it only get warmer.  The recommended Backyard Burger was a complete mess and it was so salty it was nearly inedible.  The salad that came with my meal was not dressed and was quite bitter.  During happy hour, drinks are full price in the dining area despite the fact that the bar was literally 5 yards from our table. Had i known this, i would simply have gone to the bar.   The Overall: It's a pretentious place with average food, though the prices are much higher than average. I doubt I would ever return, though if I did, i would sit at the bar and only order the artichoke, then go next door to the Gelato Spot for dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent appetizers and main course. Good wine list with many selections to enjoy. And our waiter Rodney was superb. The freshly made Burrata was so creamy and delicious served along with fried eggplant that was done perfectly. The pork scallopini Marsala and the scallops were excellent with very tasty sauce"}
{"text":"Brunch at Central Bistro.  The food and bottomless Mimosas/Bloody Marys are great. Our server Richard was fantastic. Very attentive. There were a things I noticed different from the many times I have been there before. I used to sit at the bar for Brunch on Sundays but it is not the same without Kara. The music is way to loud. Acoustic does not need to be amplified. I was so hot. Everyone in our party was dripping with sweat. I felt like we were outside in August, but we weren't. I felt really bad for the table next to us. The poor guys shirt was soaked. They didn't stay long because they couldn't handle the heat. I went into the restroom a few times to try to cool down. If you can fix the ac issue that would be great and I would come back. But for now I think I will wait till it is cool outside so I know it will be cool inside."}
{"text":"Looking at past reviews I guess there have been some changes in ownership here that resulted in inconstancies. Had a business lunch there week of 4/4. Service was outstanding and the food was excellent. The new team certainly seems to have their act together. Worth a second chance if you were disappointed here in the past."}
{"text":"3 stars is pushing it. The new menu is underwhelming and their \"new\" social hour is disappointing at best. They have managed to successfully ruin everything I loved about this place. Service. Menu. Oysters. Also, it's weird they don't serve lunch and exclusively serve their new (more expensive yet subpar) social hour menu until dinner service starts. One word: Avoid. You can have a much better experience and get more bang for your buck somewhere else in the area. Especially with so many options in the neighborhood. It's sad really, I used to love this place."}
{"text":"The bottomless memosas are what what brought us here. The food was excellent and out server, Tony, was extremely friendly. Every time he visited our table, he had the pitcher of memosa in hand. He was also very informative about the food and his judgement wasn't askew. I would recommend this to all people if earth"}
{"text":"great place for dinner and I love being able to sit on the patio as the day winds down.  As good as their food and service is, I wanted to extend kudos to them for a problem I had.  My credit card showed up with an erroneous charge, and when I called, they investigated and made sure they handled it to my satisfaction.  Nice to have a place that has good food & wine, and is very customer-oriented in every detail !"}
{"text":"The food is great. I remember this place as Zen32, but it's much bigger than when it was Zen32. The ambience is great and the food and service was amazing. Will come again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, awesome layout, great menu selection, fantastic service and my meal was outstanding.  This restaurant operator has skill... hope there are more concepts to come."}
{"text":"Everything about Central Bistro was fantastic!  The location, food and service are all top quality!   The menu includes several interesting items and the wine selection is fantastic.    The remodel is beautiful.  Anyone who had eaten at Zen 32, which was located here prior to Central Bistro, will not recognize the space.    I prefer to try new places and Central Bistro was so good I went back three times in the same week!!!  Once on Thursday for dinner, Friday for happy hour and later in the week for a light dinner.  Returned two weeks later with eight of my friends for a holiday dinner and AGAIN top quality experience.    The only suggestion I would make is to offer a more robust, exciting Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Oysters yes@$1 each I'm in! Crab Cakes Yum, num,num,num. They serve Ferrari Carrano  wines by the glass. seafood sharks will love this place."}
{"text":"What a great happy hour (ok, they prefer to call it \"social hour\") experience!  Good selection of wines divvied up into different price points between 5 and 10 bucks a glass. Wells for 4. A selection of small plates that are really quite impressive.  Service and atmosphere are top-notch. The feeling inside is bright, airy, and open.   New destination. You come too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch here. So awesome! He ordered the chicken and waffles and he LOVED it. I ordered the Oscar Benedict. Delish. The service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"my wife and I  went there this past weekend. it was really good and the service was amazing. our waiter gave us his personal suggestions and the decor was great too. and the drunk beard was amazing"}
{"text":"A great staff who were all cheerful and professional. The bar is not that big and was full when we arrived unfortunately but the patio made a nice compromise. The food was all very tasty!"}
{"text":"I loved Zen 32 and have been anxiously waiting for Central Bistro to open. I went today with 2 of my dear friends and it was fabulous. The food was wonderful and plentiful, our server was attentive as was the very cute busboy and I loved the atmosphere!  They did an amazing remodel -total renovation. If you were there before you wouldn't recognize the place. The chef even came out to see how we liked it. We all felt like we received the red carpet treatment. I would highly recommend Central Bistro for any occasion - lunch with friends, a romantic evening out., happy hour (which I'm anxious to try and will soon!) or dinner with family and friends. Great place, great food and great people. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Wow!   My family and I came here for the first time and I must say that we will definitely be returning to central bistro every time we are in the area!  From the service (Alvaro was our server) to the food -- excellent! We couldn't have asked for anything better.   We all ordered different dishes and appetizers (artichokes, calamari, eggplant, steak frites, chicken, scallops to name a few) and oh my - I have absolutely no complaints about anything. Everything was absolutely delicious. The food and service went above my expectations and I truly enjoyed my experience here. To top it off, we had the most amazing dessert (pumpkin cheesecake and milk with cookies). Thank you, Central Bistro and Alvaro for such a wonderful dinner experience!"}
{"text":"I'm begging you, PLEASE bring back oysters on happy hour. Went there on Monday with a girlfriend who is new to the area after raving about my fav happy hour spot, CB. Almost shed a small tear onto the new happy hour menu.   The new chef did send out a couple of fancy breads to our table to try but it just wasn't the same."}
{"text":"Brunch was great! We had two egg breakfast with the tiramisu buns. I think I had more than two eggs but not complaining. Our host was great. Overall it's a place to go. Love the Bottomless Mimosa for $15."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time. I am here on business from Tucson and staying at a nearby hotel.   I've been having frozen dinners microwaved in my hotel room every night so I thought I would treat myself to dinner and a drink. I drive around and settle on this place. The name Bistro appealed to me. I sat outside to read my book. The waitress was nice and friendly. I ordered a drink and a seared Ahi Tuna salad. After waiting for a while the waitress let me know they were out of ahi tuna.   I had a hard time finding something else. I'm gluten intolerant, which means Italian food is typically out of my league. So I ordered another salad, a watermelon and feta cheese salad with chicken. I got it and it had a huge round slice of watermelon, WITH THE PEEL! So I cut out the round of peel and chopped the watermelon up (might as well be at a family reunion picnic). As I started to eat I discovered the feta was missing. Good thing it's called watermelon feta salad of I might not have noticed a main ingredient was missing!  I ate it cause at this point I'm hungry. Family picnic style and all! I had to ask for feta cheese on the side.  The waitress came to check on me and realizing I am not eating all that fast asked if I was happy with the meal.   I explained if was too fruit-forward and watery for my taste and she said she would ask the manager to comp it. I said I wouldn't want to make trouble. She came back saying the manager would give me a free dessert.   I know all you dessert lovers out there are rejoicing, except as I am cursed with a gluten allergy, dessert is off my diet. I just became accustomed to not eat it.   So really why offer me something I can't eat after not having what i want and forcing me to eat what I didn't ask for????  Really people!!!  I won't go there again, though the waitress was nice."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch and brunch! Bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's!  The artichoke is a great appetizer. Delicious pepperoni pizza as well."}
{"text":"The new menu is great!!   Excited for the new chef because there is talent in that kitchen!  Burrata was well executed and had great flavor with the fennel.  Pork belly was great with the polenta and enjoyed that as well.  Change is good!!  Cheers to New ownership!"}
{"text":"Food here is amazing! My friend and I came on a Sat night and had some cocktails and split a bunch of apps.  Everything was delicious.  Service was spot on and ambience was great.  Will def come back!"}
{"text":"No more zen 32? This is better anways. :D  Hmmmmmm okay. Ready? 4  stars for delicious food, awesome customer service and great atmosphere, but didn't get that extra star because they no longer make beignets here. Nooooo!! :(  The truffle fries as a starter is a mustttt! *drools* so crispy and so tasting. My entrée was the spinach mushroom pesto pizza. Againn.. great flavoring and of course it was cooked in brick pizza oven!!!!! Pizza was FLEEK!!!! I loved it. Oh.. the mac and cheese?!? Uh huh. Simply cheesy and heavenly delighted. Hehe  I had 3 waitresses. It was great. Haha :)"}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to this opening since Zen 32 closed. They did a great job on the build out and the bar area is fantastic!  Very modern and I love how open and bright it is...perfect for this time of the year.  I have been there twice now and have been impressed.  The Arancini was delicious as well the chicken wings. I will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing! We use to love this place until they changed the menu, ownership, and staff. We went for happy hour and was informed by the hostess the menu has changed and decided to stay anyway. We were seated outside, sat for 10 minutes and with no service we left. Losing all around! Shame, shame, shame"}
{"text":"I was throughly impressed with the serving staff- everyone was very friendly and attentive. I liked the vibe of the restaurant and everything I eat was delicious! This place must be new because I had never heard of it before, but I'll definitely be back when I need to spoil myself!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the area last year, I've had Central Bistro on my Yelp bookmarks. For some reason, we hadn't made it over until a few weekends ago. My husband, his parents, and I headed over there for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation for noon and were seated almost immediately.  We were told they had fresh doughnuts (espresso with coffee glaze) and ordered some. Holy moly, they were warm and delicious! I ordered the naked pancake (one of the best pancakes I've ever had - and holy moly, they were HUGE and I got three of them! I could only eat one!) , my husband got the club sandwich (which he loved), my father in law got the Cuban sandwich (it was a big hit), and my mother in law got a really delicious superfood salad. Food was seriously awesome, and definitely filling.  The servers are dressed so adorably - their \"uniforms\" fit the gorgeous restaurant perfectly. It was a super comfortable atmosphere. One of the coolest/most unique things is the underside of their tables are lined with carpeting! I know this may seem like not a big deal, but I can't tell you how many times I've worn tights or leggings to a restaurant and had them snagged by the underside of a wooden table. So that was definitely a nice touch.  Here's my only gripe: there were musicians playing fairly loudly almost the whole time we were eating. I know some people enjoy live music while eating, but I go out to eat to visit with friends and family. My father in law was sitting closest to the musicians (who were definitely super talented) and I had to basically talk into his ear for him to hear me. In the future, I'll definitely request outdoor seating for brunch (or near the bar) so the music isn't so loud.  Overall, wonderful experience. We will definitely be back - for brunch, lunch, and to try dinner!"}
{"text":"New ownership = bad news. At least in this case. For starters, they don't have oysters anymore which was always a huge draw for happy hour. I got over that and ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, shishito peppers, grilled artichokes, drunken bread and my friend ordered the steak frite.   My wine was brought out and it was warm. Not even room temperature warm but warmer than that. It wasn't the cool and refreshing glass of white wine I was looking for on a hot sunny day. Our food came out and the disappointments continued. They had changed the delicious lemony herb sauce that came with the artichokes. Now it's basically just mayonnaise. Also disappointing was the drunken bread. It used to be a fondue poured over the bread then cooked. Now it was cheese toast and I can make cheese toast at home, it's nothing fancy. Besides that, that waiter said they cut back and only use fontina now, no Gruyere and you can tell. The shishito peppers were good and my friend enjoyed her steak but if they don't get back to the quality they used to have, I won't be back."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a bite after the USA soccer game. I've passed by this location many times and was happy to go in and finally try it out. We ordered the crab/guacamole appetizer and I had the scallop rissoto for the main course. Wow wow wow! Everything ordered was on point and cooked to perfection. The crab was so fresh too.  I will definitely be back here very soon. The next thing I will order will be the black linguini with shrimp! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Bistro Family since their sister restaurant, Local Bistro, opened in the Grey Hawk area.  I was super excited when Central Bistro brought their love to the Arcadia area.  All of their menu items are crazy delicious but my friend and I stopped by to take advantage of their Social Hour deals which do not disappoint.  Its a nice touch that they offer extended hours on their Social Hour as well as all day Social Hour on Mondays.   My friend loves Oysters and was very happy to find that they had both east and west coast options available for the Social Hour special ($1 Oysters!) and could mix and match for her order.  Our server was also very helpful to coordinate the oysters coming out later in the meal (my friend wanted to wait to have the oysters when she ordered a glass of wine).  The Drunk Bread is a go to and I was very happy with the Simple Frites, the right about of crispy with a soft center.  The mixed drinks were well done as well.  My friend found the Strawberry Smash to be a little too sweet for her and our server was happy to accommodate her with a new drink and remove the strawberry one from our bill.    The only misstep we have experience here is with the bussing staff.  I appreciate a busser who is on top of his game, but not when they are so quick to take your plate that there is still food left on it.  We have had this issue a couple times now and its disappointing to miss out on that last bite or last sip of booze.  All in all, a great, local addition to the Arcadia Area!"}
{"text":"What an amazing brunch!! The server really new the menu and was very good, he recommended the scrambled eggs with gryuer cheese on a Cresent roll, it was spot on. Great looking venue with an awesome brunch,  I'll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to the opening of this place since Zen 32 closed and had lunch there today. The atmosphere was modern and airy, and service was very good.  It would be a cool place to have a drink at the bar later in the day.  Nice patio and lots of big windows that were open to let in light and fresh air on this unusually overcast day in Phoenix.  I thought the food was decent, but not remarkable, and it's a bit pricy for lunch.  It is however, a great spot for business lunches/drinks.   I wish them well but unfortunately I won't be dining there again as long as they continue to serve fois gras. If you're not  familiar with fois gras, I won't elaborate; just know that it's a delicacy so cruelly-derived that it's banned in many countries as well as the state of Califormia and the city of Chicago. It's my personal decision to not support restaurants where it's served.    Make a small change to the menu and I'll be back...."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is *delightful* here. (2-6 daily, ALL day Monday). A spiffed up after work crowd sprinkles in, spilling over to bar area tables, creating a great vibe. They're running a crazy HH special where oysters are $1.  Again,  ONE DOLLAR.  I was already sold on this gem of a place. The wacky pricing just sealed the deal. Note: Oysters must be ordered by the 1/2 dozen. The oysters are delicious. My friend's pizza looked heavenly. (Sadly, I had eaten earlier and couldn't stuff another morsel in.)   Central Bistro calls HH \"Social Hour\". It's spot on with the ambiance and space. I'd hurry in if a barstool is important as this place fills up! Don't fret tho. You can nab a 4-top and still feel in the know. The vodka drink of the day (Mandarin blossom, citron, and kaffir lime) was refreshingly light. The followup beer I enjoyed (go ahead, judge) was equally divine.  This is a 4 star review instead of 5. Our bartender seemed....indifferent to our existence. Even though there were four of us (right in the middle of the bar) we resorted to waiving our arms. However, Brendan made us feel welcome.    And did I mention the oysters?  Right. Get some!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy coming here. Nice atmosphere and classy but not snobbish. Food is very well cooked and flavored. Don't hesitate to try new things and ask the server for recommendations.  They really know the menu and guide you well."}
{"text":"After going to the Central Bistro for the elite event earlier this week, I decided to give them a try today for brunch. I was a little leery of going because they don't have their brunch menu posted on their website and the BF is allergic to eggs, so I always like to check out menus before going, but we decided to go for it anyway.  Let me say, their menu is great! They had over 5 options for him to eat that were not egg based (pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, etc). They also have a variety of egg items that all look delicious. After being seated, the waiter brought water and a tray of sliced citrus so you can pick your own flavoring for the water...very fancy. We started with donuts and coffee (we had a free coup from our goodie bag) and this was the most delicious part of the whole meal. The donuts reminded me of little zeppoles in a delicious orange cream sauce....so good! The coffee was french pressed and also wonderful. For entrees, I got the truffle egg sandwich (a fried egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, and a truffle aioli I had put on the side on an english muffin) and the BF had the pancakes. The sandwich was good, but I wish they used an over medium egg versus an over hard egg, but I could specify that next time now that I know. The pancakes were alright, but nothing super special until we put some of that orange sauce from the donuts onto the pancakes and then they were delicious! Also, the service here was amazing. Our waiter, I think his name was John but not sure (sorry, I'm bad with names!), was attentive, gave good recommendations and seemed like a down to earth kind of guy, which I really appreciated. The bill was reasonable as well. Although I wouldn't say this is the best breakfast in town, it was a solid choice and I would definitely come back here for brunch again!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in this place. =/   We came here for my sister's birthday for dinner. I ordered the mushroom risotto. I usually don't eat a lot so I don't even finish my plate. However, their plates here are tiny. I finished almost the entire thing. For $20 a plate you would think it would be a pretty good size plate. The mushrooms were very flavorful. The risotto however was extremely bland and had no flavor whatsoever. My boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle bolognese pasta. Let's just say he left the restaurant still hungry. The sad part is the dish was delicious.   Since we had a huge group, we had two waiters. One on each side of our table. The side across from us got their drinks, food and check way before we did. It took almost 30 minutes for us to get our check after requesting it and to top it off it was incorrect. The only plus for me was was my lemon drop martini that the bartender whipped up that wasn't on the menu. We spent a total of $60 and left hungry. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Large portions, excellent food! We attended their opening and were pleasantly surprised at the portions of food. Each dish we ordered was fabulous but my personal favorite was the pork tenderloin. I'm ashamed to say, I ate the whole thing!  Ambiance couldn't be better. The lighting is perfect and the noise level not to loud considering the open space.  Their hours are fm 11am to late night....1:00am. Except Sunday they are only open for dinner.   This is a must try at least once, but I'm sure you'll be hooked. I'm going back next week to try their salads for lunch.  If you live up north/DC Ranch Area, also consider trying their sister restaurant Local Bistro. Everything there is fabulous as well but my two favorites are their burger and chicken dishes."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars Service: 3 stars Decor: 5 stars  Came here for Restaurant Week.  I made a reservation online, which was a simple and easy process.  Our table was waiting for us when we arrived, so we were very happy!  They served a nice fluffy bread with olive oil to start.  I thought the bread was delicious.  However... the food started to go downhill from there.  The orchard salad was my starter and it was nice and crispy with a light dressing, with lots of interesting things thrown in there for taste and texture like raisins (or were they cranberries?), nuts, brussel sprouts, etc.  My entree came out next which was sea scallops and risotto.  The quality of the scallops was A+.  They were large and soft, not chewy.  Unfortunately, the brininess of the sea scallops, when combined with the additional salt in the dish was overwhelmingly salty... in a very bad way.  I kept eating my scallops and trying to force them down bc I had paid for them, but after the first few bites I really wasn't enjoying it.  I never like risotto, and I knew that when I ordered the dish I wouldn't like the risotto but I really did want the sea scallops, so I won't comment on the taste of the risotto.  I left almost all my risotto untouched.  The dessert was peach cobbler.  They really should have called it a peach \"crumble\" bc there wasn't the typical soft cobbler crust that you would expect (and want!).  This dessert was a disappointment and I literally ate one bite and didn't feel like eating anymore.  Besides the lack of a yummy crust, the peaches were flavored with some kind of herb (maybe rosemary) that I didn't enjoy.  So yeah... I basically only enjoyed the salad and choked down the scallops and didn't eat about half my meal.... I don't like to be one of those people that sends food back, but I would have hoped that our waiter, when seeing that my plates (and others' plates too) were being cleared with a MAJORITY of the food still on them, that the waiter would have done something to make sure we got food we enjoyed.  On the plus side, since some people at our table were first time patrons, they brought us complimentary chocolate chip cookies, which were fabulous! along with vanilla milk.  A really nice touch!"}
{"text":"If you are visiting the Phoenix area, this has to be on your lists of stops! I had the filet and it was phenomenal! I would definitely come back and recommend to my friends."}
{"text":"The food is spectacular! The portions are perfect and the atmosphere is terrific! We live in the neighborhood and we will definitely be regulars at Central Bistro!"}
{"text":"The setup, location and offerings here look promising. I'm looking forward to making another trip in the future. I was here with my wife and some friends for a Yelp event so my experience was limited but promising. I'll definitely add more detail if/when we make it back to that side of town to try it again."}
{"text":"This place I was really excited for! I was told it was really good so I came in with high expectations. For appetizer we had the cheese and meat platter which was good. The wait or kept our water glasses filled. I got the steak frites. I am a big steak Eater so I was so ready to dig in. The steak was relatively small, which usually doesn't bother me because usually the taste makes up for it. But i could not really taste the steak because there was so much salt. The French fries were exceptionally good. If you ask for it with less salt I'm sure it would be awesome."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch with a few friends - the food, ambiance, and service was amazing.  Hard to imagine they've just opened. Started off with the grilled octopus, which was truly remarkable - so tender and flavorful, served on a bed of garbanzo bean paste (similar to humus) and purple potato cubes.  Thought I was on the coast for a minute. My entrée was the seared salmon - magnificent - perfectly cooked and seasoned, served again with the purple cubed potatoes and grilled artichoke hearts.  I almost ordered another to take home. The table ordered baguettes for desert which came with 3 dipping sides of chocolate, (tapioca?) crème, and caramel.  Unfortunately I was not quick enough and only got to try one but it was marvelous. To top everything off, their tap / beer list is fantastic - full of true craft beers from all the heavy hitters along with some locals and imports.  Anchor Humming Ale was my thrice time selection.  The wine list looked ultra deep and diverse as well (just like their glass wine cellar).  Cant wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"\"Disappointed\" is the word for this review. This trendy little place in a strip mall studded with alternate choices was our choice for dinner. Loud, really loud inside. Inattentive service ... water glasses left unfilled, no second drink order, no mention of dessert, just lackluster all around. And the food. Meh. Soggy pizza, flavorless oysters, over salted mushroom sauce on the gnocchi, and burnt artichokes. I could almost go one star, but the bathroom was clean, and the hostess was friendly. Skip it."}
{"text":"Amazing menu.  I need to go back and try everything on it.   Cocktails are tasty and creative.  My hubs and I each started with one, and a half dozen oysters.  Then he got the mac and cheese of the moment (shortrib and mushroom) - it was amazing... I kept reaching across the table to steal bites.  I got the pasta with clams.  Really tasty, bonus points for house-made pasta.  Everything was flavorful and pretty large portions.  Menu is on the pricier side, which may prevent us from going weekly... but the service and ambience validate the price.   I really appreciate all of the \"of the moment\" daily specials.  Lots of great touches - like getting offered citrus of choice (lemon, lime, orange) on a platter with your water.  We are looking forward to going to back and trying more of the menu.   Also plan on coming for happy hour... great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were trying to find a restaurant we would both enjoy after leaving the CMYE at LGO.  He had his fill of carbs at LGO, so we decided to try Central Bistro.  Let me first say that our waitress was AMAZING.  I think her name was Cara.  She was extremely helpful, funny and genuine.  She was on top of refills and did not rush us out when it was clear we had finished our dinner.  Second, the food was quite good.  I had the ahi tuna salad.  The tuna was perfectly seared.  I loved the avocado and pineapple.  The only note I have on the dish was that I was given greens the size of a half head of lettuce!  It was just too much lettuce.  I felt wasteful.  I suppose some people can eat a huge salad, but I left most of the lettuce on the plate.    I like the ambience here.  The noise level was appropriate.  We were seated near the bar and we were able to have a perfectly good conversation without trouble.    A lot of the patrons seemed to be male, with many appearing to be discussing business or having just come from work.  I'd like to visit again at happy hour and see if the mix of people changes.   I would make a drive from Ahwatukee to eat here again.  I guess that means I like it!  :)"}
{"text":"Though we can't be 100% sure, I believe my fiance got food poisoning from the raw oysters he ate here a few weeks ago. We shared all the food that night with the exception of the oysters. He woke up in the middle of the night sick. I originally didn't think too much about it but after a week of still not feeling better, we opted for a trip to the doctor. When explaining the symptoms and the only other food that we both hadn't eaten was the oyster's, he thought that most certainly it could have been the cause since it was the only difference in our diet. After a three day round of antibiotics and another Rx for stomach issues, he is feeling better.   I don't know much about seafood (I don't eat anything from the sea) and especially not anything raw so I don't know if it could have been improperly handling or there was just a bad one in the six that he ate. I also don't like reporting something we can't be 100% sure of either but I thought it was worth warning others about. Either way, I don't think he'll be back any time for oysters in the future. He did think it was unusual for the oysters coming from the West coast rather than the East when he ordered though so not sure if that is useful either? There was a guy next to us who also had the oysters so it would have been interesting to know if he got sick too."}
