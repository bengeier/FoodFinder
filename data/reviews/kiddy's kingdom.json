{"text":"\"warning parents\" !!!!! Please beware of this faulty company! I was assured by the owner that I would be pleased with the costume characters that I paid a $75 deposit for and remainder to be paid once the service was rendered. To my humiliation , the costume characters were \"dirty\", \"dingy\" and \"too large\" for the young children who were wearing them. The children appeared mortified to even see me when I approached the van they were sitting in, since the representative demanded payment upfront., I asked to see the characters FIRST!!!!PLEASE be cautious when retaining their services , the characters are nothing like the photos on their website !! They are deceiving !!!"}
{"text":"I hired 2 Ninja Turtles for a 5th birthday party. Neither were very interactive. One literally just stood in place. The worst was the music & unsafe games. The Children where given an air pump with a long pointy tip & told to play hot potato with it!! Music played was streamed & not the kiddie scrubbed versions. We finally asked them to leave. I contacted Kiddys Kingdom & just got an \"oh sorry, I'lll look into it.\" We did also get a bounce house from them which worked out well & prior to the event everyone was helpful & friendly so I would give them a few stars for that."}
