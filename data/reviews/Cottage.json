{"text":"The food was so disgusting that we threw it out and I had to cook dinner anyway. Waste of money. Terrible service as well."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this restaurant has new cooks, but the beef fried rice is very bland.  Ordered the Chicken Mei Fun and the chicken tastes like it was boiled and the dish is very bland.  I ordered two egg rolls and didn't receive them.  Delivery takes an hour.  Too slow."}
{"text":"The worst chinese on planet earth. The chicken they use must be jerky and I am not joking.  Dry stringy hard niblets of meat. So hard it chokes you.  The boneless spareibs were just flat pound pieces of pork and wayyyy too salty. Just not happy at all.  The shrimp toast was burnt and beyond fishy tasting.  Burn the cottage!!"}
{"text":"Probably the nastiest food I've eaten in a long time. I ordered chicken fried rice and pineapple chicken. The chicken lacked flavor and was fatty for the most part. The rice tasted like it was fried in Old grease. The egg roll was soggy and greasy, just nasty. Everything tasted greasy and I'm currently nauseous and feeling quite sick after eating from here. Definitely won't be going back ever!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this is unacceptable. Would give zero stars if I could. Ordered chicken wings and fried rice around 10pm, it was bland and tasteless but I ate it anyways since I was hungry and didn't have anything else to cook at home. Woke up at 2am vomiting uncontrollably. This continued ALL NIGHT, I was extremely dizzy unable to stand and had to go to the doctor to be told I have caught a stomach virus aka food poisoning from this place. 2 days later I'm still sick. Never going back."}
{"text":"Good food and fast. It's nothing special just good take out Chinese food. I wouldn't recommend dining in, only a few booths. Big portions and reasonable prices. They deliver but I always get take out. Their dumplings, steamed or fried, are excellent. Standard Chinese menu plus classic American food, it's sort of odd getting a philly cheese steak or a hot dog at a Chinese place but everything I've had there is good."}
