{"text":"Great ingredients, nice guys, and a friendly atmosphere.   I really like the Mahi Mahi, with some hummus, lettuce, rice, tomatoes and a light drizzle of ZiKiZ's dressing.  The only caveat is the wraps are made with tortilla-like flat bread. If you're expecting Pita, then you will be surprised - but not disappointed."}
{"text":"Hope this place succeeds. Healthy food on the go. Inexpensive. Great options. Wraps, rice bowls, salads. Good falafel. Quiet, clean place."}
{"text":"This is not a Lebanon's restaurant the food is ok but for the price NOT that's good at all the portion is very small for the price I will not be going there again"}
{"text":"Really great new Mediterranean place. Perfect if you want healthy, fast options that also taste delicious. Staff was friendly and knowledgable!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot! Fast, consistent and good! Everyone is friendly and the food is delicious. I got my co- workers hooked on this place. Very casual"}
{"text":"Tried ZikiZ on a whim after searching on Yelp for something new. After eating there the first time, I was back two more times that week and have visited nearly weekly ever since. Travis ALWAYS greets me when I walk in and takes great care of us. I brought family in tonight from out of town and they've been raving about it ever since. The food is delicious (best sweet potato fries I've ever had!) the menu is simple, and everyone can customize their meals. Service is always quick and the place is always clean. I highly recommend ZikiZ to anyone and everyone. Even if you're not sure if you like Gyros, you have to go and try it out. Their gyros and bowls are phenomenal."}
{"text":"If you have been to Greece and the Middle East there  is no contest who has the best hummus in Vegas. I have been to Lebanon on more than one occasion where hummus was  originated (PHOENICIANS) and copied by the Greeks (Alexander the Great), Turks, and other Arabic nations. The real thing made from  scrap with that integrety and taste by far  we are so lucky to have is ZIKIZ. It doesn't look like yellow glue, hard paste , store bought, that all you can  taste is the garlic.  ZIKiZ' recipe is original from the  old  country and even the dark  golden color tells you that  the smooth taste is different with the finest ingredients and yes garlicy but with a great mixture of the  chick peas, lemon, etc. takes you back in time for the real thing.  Try  it once and I am sure you will agree.  You've tried the  rest now it's time to  try the best.  M. Haddad, Chicago/Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I miss my hometown deli in Ohio.  But, after reading reviews on several places decided to check out Zikiz today and I wasn't dissapointed.  I got a hummus plate with red onion and tabbouleh with falafel.  I loved it! It was perfect....and I mean, hummus and falafel can be tricky to get spot on...if the spices are overdone, you will be burping up, bloating, or have heartburn. They definitely know what they are doing here, as everything was very tasty. I will be back for more raw food / vegetarian and gluten free meals and I'm glad they are here!!!!"}
{"text":"First time there today with my wife. My wrap and her salad were both fantastic. Healthy and tasty food, friendly service... What's not to like."}
{"text":"Finally, an oasis in this Mediterranean-food desert! Great portions and the dishes come with a good flavorful combination of food for a decent price. Loved the gyro plate!  My brother unfortunately is (mildly) allergic to beans, so the nice fellow behind the counter made an excellent effort to accommodate by substituting the hummus. Even though my bro just opted for double rice in the end, the man was confident and ready to take pride in \"finding something you'll like\" as a replacement side.  No, it's not one of those hole-in-the-wall family recipe places, but for a chain, Zikis has some real delicious and reasonably priced meals that could also be considered one of the more healthful choices you can make, given how quick it's made to order!   Will definitely be coming back.  P.S: The \"Cupz\" place it's connected to is awesome for dessert afterwards. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and I enjoyed my gyro burrito and my husband enjoyed his falafel burrito. I love it because you can customize your order. It is also vegan friendly. The Cajun fries was very tastey too. The staff is very friendly and nice. We will be back here again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service and nice staff.  This really is a franchise waiting to happen.  Eddie Sr. was very nice and accommodating.  He gave us our drinks for free since it was the first time we tried the food.  We live right around the corner and will be frequenting ZiKiz.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. We just got home after a six hour flight from New York and was looking for a bite to eat. What a pleasant surprise! Customer service was great! The girls were very helpful and friendly. The food was outstanding! We loved it and will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Saw that they were opening a new location, did not think that meant that they would be closing this one!! Was quite frustrated when I went to get some food the other day and their door was locked and the interior empty. Yeaaaaaa... not driving all the way to their new location. Probably not a smart move."}
{"text":"Overcharged $2 and when I asked for my refund I was told it's only $2 and it wasn't worth his time to ring the purchase up again. Maybe you shouldn't have a special if you don't want to actually charge people the discounted price. Pretty disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Fresh food! The owners are really nice. I eat here multiple time's a week. I feel really welcomes everytime I come in and go. They make sure your food was good and make aure you're taken care of. The Humus  and their special dressing is delicious."}
{"text":"Meats were plain. But fresh food. So if you want something light and fresh. Its cool. Just a lil over what i want to pay for a bowl. Chiptole is cheaper."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I have never been disappointed here.  Today I had to go with the Zikis falafel wrap. Big shout-out to Ed for hooking me up.  If you have never experienced this place you need to check it out."}
{"text":"This great little Greek place in GV is fantastic. I usually get the chicken bowl with Zikiz rice and dressing which is delicious but the salads are really good also. Lots of fresh ingredients to choose from and great service have had me eating here a lot lately!"}
{"text":"Today was the first time. We were greeted by the owner and what a great personality he had, I wanted to take him home with me lol   Their hummus was absolutely amazing I did not take any home but he did give me a sample by far it was the best hummus I've ever had. I had a wrap with salmon and that was absolutely amazing I demolished it.  I would definitely come back again! :)"}
{"text":"Hummus is amazing and fresh! Loved the falafels. I will definitely be back. Great owner, friendly staff"}
{"text":"Delicious and refreshing food. Fresh taste in every bite and friendly service is a plus. Good job. Very hard to get here but will def be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for lunch. It was our first time there and we will we back again! The employee was nice and helpful and the owner was there too. Great food and great people. I had the vegetarian falafel wrap and my fianc√© had a steak wrap. We were very impressed and happy we stopped in :-) delicious, quick and fresh."}
{"text":"First time experience. I never usually post about negative experiences but...  It was early evening, I noticed it was not busy and there were two employees. Upon stepping up to the counter I noticed the choice of veggies were colorless, Simple is right. Maybe too simple. I noticed the cucumbers were looking a little dark and flimsy and I was told by one of the employees that they could \"dig to the bottom and see if they could find me some good ones\"   I was a little too embarrassed to turn around and leave so I purchased a nearly 10 dollar meal that was definitely not worth more than 4 dollars at most. The chicken was bland and watered down. The rice was flavorless. And the lettuce... slightly browning iceberg...   Needless to say, I have no interest of returning and I don't recommend spending your hard earned money here. Sorry Zikis, step your game up."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Huge portions and very tasty steak. Had a hummus bowl and could barely finish half of it. I met the owner and he really seems passionate and caring about his business. It's great to see this kind of commitment to pleasing their customers."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go get a healthy amazing wrap. Would recommend and will surely be back!"}
{"text":"The people I met working were very friendly, and happy to talk! Food was out of this world, amazing wraps! They've found themselves a new regular.  the most IMPORTANT NOTE? They accept bitcions! i'm so happy to have found a great tasting shop that accepts bitcoins!  5/5"}
{"text":"Great food, esp falafel. The owner is very friendly and clearly cares about his customers. Theres nothing like walking into a business and the employees and owner know you by your first name."}
{"text":"Zikis is always the first meal I want when I come home from college. Their wraps are essentially delicious Greek burritos and are spectacular! The workers are all so friendly and considerate. I love walking in and having a conversation with the owner, who is often there, or any of the other staff. It is one of, if not my favorite, family owned restaurant, and is certainly not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I think this place is family owned & operated. People are really nice. Very clean, organized eating area. The way I can describe this place is like a Middle Eastern Chipotle. You can make your own bowl or a wrap. The meat was very tasty & tender. The veggies were fresh. The ZIKIZ sauce was amazing. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Specially if you want something simple but yummy & filling but not heavy."}
{"text":"First visit was to the Henderson store, ordered a chicken wrap, chicken was undercooked veggies were anything but fresh and the food was terrible, was comped a $10 gift card for my next visit, figure I give them another try and visited  the store on blue diamond, after ordering was told They couldn't honor this gift card at this location for whatever reason same owner, same restaurant which was really disappointing. Ordered the two falafel plates, the food again was very disappointing falafel tasted like it was frozen the rice had very little flavor to it, the hummus was ok definitely nothing special, again  another horrible experience, the gentleman at the counter was really nice and courteous, I guess he felt bad he couldn't honor my gift card and comped us free dessert from the coffee shop next which I guess is the same business. Ordered the cheesecake which was probably one of the worst I have ever had. I'm usually not one to complaint but after another bad experience with this restaurant and another $24 on subpar food, I felt the need to warn others. Will definitely not be returning. Try parsley Mediterranean and tell me the difference isn't night and day. All together probably one of the worst experiences with any restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not authentic Greek food it's actually worse then the new Greek spot down the street on blue diamond. All my food was bland and the Greek fries are a joke. We were definitely rubbed the wrong way by the gentleman that took our order, the place was empty. We explained it was our first time and he still continued to act awkward instead of telling us more about the restaurant and how it works. He's got horrible customer service skills and looks miserable. I can't remember the last time I felt this uncomfortable. The older man was awesome and very vocal. If your looking for a legit Greek / Mediterranean experience go check out Khoury's Mediterranean Restaurant it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Zikiz. It is just SO good. The only way I could describe it is, it's like a Lebanese Chipotle.    I usually get a wrap or a bowl, and they load it up with everything for me. I've had the steak which is great, but I'm really crazy about their falafel. I'm willing to go out on a limb and say its the best I've ever had. I crave this falafel."}
{"text":"Not typically my kind of place......but really really good.  Will go back.  Wish it was close to work. I would eat lunch there all the time."}
{"text":"Thus is my second time coming here and the food is always good. It's fresh.  I had the zikiz rice bowl with chicken. I can't stop eating long enough to write this review.  The staff is very friendly and helpful in making recommendations. The flavors are so good. It's like a part in my mouth.  YUMMY."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere are always a must for me to return.  The food needs to be good too but a friendly owner and staff go a long way. The good news is the food is great too.  I know this place is new but they are doing everything right as if they had been there for years. Owner made suggestions at ordering and asked how everything was when I was finished.    I will return"}
{"text":"First time there last night. I was so excited to see their menu had many healthy options so I stopped in for dinner. Everything looked great until I saw the state of the greens selection they had for salads and was sorely disappointed. The spinach, kale, and mixed greens were either browning or wilting. I'd gladly return if they get a fresher approach to their greens choices. Try the fries! Delish!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience and plan on returning in the near future. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There are plenty of options to choose from as well. I had a bowl with brown rice, steak, and a little of every avaliable side to add. All topped with the mango curry sauce. It was delicious. I was very happy with the portion size and left feeling nice a full. Great work! Can't wait to try a wrap on my next visit."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The bowls are the best. Great for lunch and I always have the second half leftover for dinner. They're so huge, I can't ever eat the whole thing! Service is always good and super fast."}
{"text":"So good!  Fresh, flavorful and fast.  Completely customizable and great price too.  I usually get a wrap, but, the bowls are calling my name for next time..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Lunch options are limited where I work and this place is close, affordable, and so fresh! Love that I can get a healthy lunch and my afternoon caffeine fix in one stop"}
{"text":"Saw this place in passing when getting lunch to take to a friend and stopped in with no expectations.  I was SO thrilled to find all the amazing ingredients,  totally customizable to my taste, and friendly,  fast service.  Ive been telling all my other health-minded friends about this place as the best in the area to get a healthy, affordable, tasty meal.  Im gojng back today :)"}
{"text":"The food was decent. I walked in at 11am on a Monday and two guys in the back ignored me. Service was poor and they were very short with me. When I asked about hummus they were very pejorative in their dismissal of my request to add hummus to the bowl. I'm an out of towner so I would definitely not return. Maybe a different location with competent or friendly staff."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, tasty, and good prices...how can you go wrong?!! Love this place for quick lunch bite or weekend stop!"}
{"text":"I just moved to Henderson and was in the mood to have something healthier for dinner. Fortunately, I live right next door to Pebble Marketplace and discovered ZiKiZ. Good gods this food is awesome! I agree with some comparisons to Chipotle, but I find the vegetables and offerings to be far fresher than what I get at Chipotle. They even have an option for you to get mahi or salmon grilled while you wait to be added to your bowl or wrap. Hummus is made fresh on the premises.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the bowl I got then (and have gotten since) was quite full and I was not left hungry. I think their hummus is easily the best hummus I've had anywhere, and I stop in occasionally just to buy a side of that. Maybe the one reviewer who stated they only got a half tub went in on a bad day, but I've ALWAYS received a full tub of hummus.  The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating, and completely willing to answer any questions or make suggestions. Be sure to sign up for their \"frequent eater\" card as well. I should also mention that the times I've been in there have been two very young female employees there who have the professionalism of people twice their age. If more retailers hired folks like them you'd see a big increase in the quality of customer service in retail overall.  Definitely my new, favorite place to eat!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Zikiz restaurant in Henderson on 02/03/17, our first experience eating there.  We were impressed with the food, certainly something to appeal to anyone.  We were greeting immediately by the staff. We told them it was our first time there, and they were very pleasant and helpful in making our selections. Food was very good quality and quite tasty. I had the bowl with chicken and assorted condiments over a bed of brown rice.  It was delicious, and more than I could eat. Would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Zikiz one Sunday evening. I wasn't impressed. The food was bland. After the cook fried the steak, he put it straight on my wrap without letting it soak up the flavors and seasoning from the pan that it sits in. The small portion was dry and had some grizzle. However, I did like the side of pita bread, which tasted fresh, and humus. To make things worse, the young woman who helped me was a bit rude and after I thanked her, she said nothing and just walked away to help another customer."}
{"text":"My first time eating here I got the Falafel plate. It looked great and tasted alright. But let's just say after eating it... my stomach hated me for it. Diarrhea all night after that. Damn."}
{"text":"Zikis is a quick walk in place to grab a fresh and healthy lunch. The food was ok but a bit bland. They offer their own special Ziki fries that offers hummus, tabouli, feta and their own ziki sauce on tip of fries. It looked very appetizing but was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I got to try Zikiz from Ubereats, and have been ordering from them multiple times now. The hummus is delicious, but I ask for it on the side so the bowl doesn't get all soggy by the time it gets here. The rice could be better, but otherwise this is a pretty solid place. I will be ordering more often now!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in las vegas! The hummus bowl with Ziki rice and wild caught salmon is delicious we eat here regularly since they first opened!"}
{"text":"I've  been going to eat here since they first open their first location on Green Valley Parkway. The food is absolutely amazing! The meets are juicy, the salmon melts in your mouth and all the ingredients are super healthy. It's definitely a family favorite of ours!"}
{"text":"Fresh food and fast, came in just to try the place, met the owners Eddie and Eddie, they were super nice. Even gave me a sample cookie. All I can say is you must try the fries! They are delicious. I had a wrap with crab (they have steak and chicken too) but the crab was amazing and HEALTHY! All the service employees were really nice.  Awesome new place will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If consistency is the key to success, well, Zikiz is going to be extremely successful. They are in a great location, the staff is always friendly and the food is delicious. Everything is hot and fresh. You can customize just about anything and the price is right. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I didn't finish my meal. Not even half of it. I NEVER waste food, but the hummus bowl wasn't worth $9 and it wasn't worth trying to finish.   Hummus is bland and runny. There are plenty of great hummus places in town. I go to a Jewish school, we eat hummus all the time. This was beyond subpar.   The steak looked like wet cafeteria food and tasted off. With the toppings I asked for cucumber. He put on 2 slices. Are you serious? Topping ingredients were fresh. 2 pieces of pita bread. Nothing special and I like pita bread almost anywhere.  I don't know why people like this place. Literally everywhere else is better. Greek Bistro. Crazy Pita. Great Greek."}
{"text":"Yummy food the falafel is really good they definitely have a clean taste... Which is key for wraps. I come here for lunch pretty often."}
{"text":"This place was pretty great i got a Chicken bowl with rice & veggies, great size i was able to share it . The Ziki sauce was AMAZING!! staff was very friendly and place was very clean. i will defiantly be going back"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant.  As someone who is constantly watching what she eats, I totally dig healthy restaurants with build your own flair.  Zikiz is exactly that.   You have a choice to build your own wrap, salad, or bowl. Pick a protein, veggies, and a sauce to complete your meal. They also have sides including THE MOST delicious hummus I've ever eaten. In addition, they  carry some tasty gluten free baked goods.   I have visited several times. The staff is always friendly and the place is always clean.  You can even order/pay ahead and pick up if you're crunched for time.  Finally, the restaurant is locally owned and family operated so you can feel good about spending your money here.   If you're looking for a yummy, quick, and satisfying meal, look no further!!!"}
{"text":"It's not bad. I had better quality food from Parsleys Mediterranean in my opinion. Plus while I was ordering there was a fly that was hovering around the veggies. Not good. Perhaps invest in the eco friendly lights that ECOLAB sells. $8 for a wrap half the size of the bigger wrap that I can get at Parsleys."}
{"text":"So good! Prices seem a bit high, but I would pay again. I had a wrap and my fianc√© had the bowl. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago..been to New York, LA, Lebanon, Miami.. It is so nice to find the REAL THING finally in Las Vegas. Most of the Mediteranean/Middle Eastern restaurants .... served in the strip hotels and Vegas Mediteranean/Middle East  restaurants are  3 stars at best.  You can find better hummus in Albertsons, Vons, or Trader Joes.  There is one exception which is THE REAL THING.  Zikis on Green Valley Parkway.  I live in the Centennial area and after recommendations by many of my freinds, I had to try it. Finally, a real restaurant with fresh and authentic cookiing that blows away Vegas competition and is  worth the  trip.  What is also nice is the price is right while these other places inflate the price but reduce the quality.  CleanIiness is Godlyness and this place is impecable and spotless. If you are familiar with this  food you understand what I  mean. I feel like I visited Lebanon or back home in Chicago again but even there Zikiz would stand out with their traditional and new recipes.  MH, LAS  VEGAS AND  CHICAGO"}
{"text":"Really well done marketing and branding, very well thought out, well executed. I've only eaten there once but I was underwhelmed by the food. I had a plate,  and my biggest take away from it was how anemic the falafel was. It was cold, seemed old, definitely not fresh, very disappointing.   To be fair, I'm spoiled in that I've been fortunate enough to enjoy fresh hot flavor-busting middle eastern cuisine served by little old ladies on public busses in Cairo and Alexandria, and I've enjoyed perfectly prepared baba ghanoush served from a tiny bodega squeezed in between large tenaments near 116th & Broadway in NYC. So like I said, I'm spoiled. But this restaurant's food (the one time I tried it) falls far short of the genuine stuff I've had in Egypt and NYC.  I hope this restaurant puts more focus on providing flavorful fresh food."}
{"text":"Love Zikis. First time at the Blue Diamond location, great healthy option for fast food with quality ingredients. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean, and quiet. Good relaxing spot to have a healthy lunch. You can choose between a wrap, salad, rice bowl or hummus plate. Pick your protein, toppings, and dressing. All for the average price of about $8. Lots of fresh ingredients to choose from with friendly staff. They were cleaning the other tables while I was eating and as each customer got up and left, that's always nice to see because it assures you you're eating on a clean table. I'll definitely be back to try a wrap next time. The salad was delicious and refreshing."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We were in Vegas and just wanted to have a quick bite to eat. I got one of their salad bowls and the quality and flavor of the meat were amazing. If I am in Vegas again I will visit this place for sure. And they have a huge selection of fountain drinks. They have this digital selection/vending soda machine where you can pick from every soda drink on the planet I think. Great place."}
{"text":"i like this place a lot. i usually just get the ziki rice bowl or hummus plate with falafels which have been delicious. the only reason i'm giving a 4/5 is because i invited my friend out to zikiz since i love it and he somehow managed to order something super ungood. i wish i can remember what it was but i think it was some sort of a salad. i'm generally a pretty adventurous eater but now i'm scared to try anything else at zikiz. haha."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to grab a bite to eat.  Think of Greek or middle eastern chipotle.  Food quality is good and the employee attitudes are great.  Definitely give it a try atleast once to see if it is something you will like. You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"So I fell in love with this place when I spotted it Henderson , didn't get the same service there than when they opened it here on blue diamond ! Let me just say . The owner (I'm sorry forgot his name ) was seriously so warming and welcoming... the staff super helpful and nice... , the food oh my amazing ! I give props to this place and so happy that they opened a new location , definitely coming here before I go to work when I don't have time to cook lol"}
{"text":"I love the people here!  Father and son are awesome people and they care about your experience here.  The food is outstanding.  Love their hummus!"}
{"text":"This food is the freshest, best tasting I've ever had. Amazing hummus. Fresh dressings and lamb and chicken that water in your mouth. This place CRUSHES any Greek food in the area. It's not even close. The Ziki rice alone is amazing. As a extra benifit, the owners remember your name. They make you feel like your coming home every time you come back. Forget anything else and just try Ziki's. I promise you will have a new favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"Great googly moogly! Why did I wait so long to visit. Great wraps; fast, fresh, and served with friendly peeps behind the counter.  I had a chicken wrap in a spinach shell, with hummus and tabouli, and topped with their house dressing. Very nice, and a great size; just think Chipotle with a Mediterranean flair.   I'll definitely be back, it's quick, reasonably priced, and doesn't leave a lump in your gut."}
{"text":"I stopped in here with a friend for lunch.  It was my first time trying it out.  The dining area was clean with plenty of tables for a quick lunch.  The prep area was also extremely clean and was good to see.    Service was just ok.  I showed my coupon for the $2 off with a Yelp check in.  After she ran the card, we looked at the receipt and noticed she didn't take it off.  Luckily she just gave us the money back but strange that just seconds before I had shown her the coupon.     You order just like at Chipotle or Subway.  Pick and choose which toppings you'd prefer.  I ordered the chicken in the spinach wrap. I chose rice, banana peppers and cheese to fill the wrap.  It was good.  I wanted the sweet potato fries as soon as I saw it on their side menu.  Right before paying she decided to tell me their fryers weren't on so it would be a 15 minute wait for those. If you're open for business, wouldn't you want the kitchen to be ready? I went with the hummus instead.  It was good but the pita they served with it didn't seem fresh.    I would try it again with hope their service and preparedness is improved."}
{"text":"Amazing falafel! I was greeted by a kind and helpful man. The ingredients were all really fresh and you could customize to your liking. Super happy I found this place so close to home. They will know my name soon."}
{"text":"Tried ZiKiZ for the first time tonight. I built my own wrap and it was delicious!! The staff (I'm pretty sure he was the owner) was super nice and due to him I am writing my first yelp review. Not super often you get great food and super friendly service. :):) Definitely will be going back to try their falafel!!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I ordered food from here off Uber Eats, and have never actually been inside the place. That being said, I ordered a salad with falafel and a side of hummus, and my bf got a gyro wrap. Not only was the food made and delivered to us SUPER fast, it tasted extremely fresh and delicious! My salad was made perfectly and the dressing was delicious and healthy. My boyfriend said his wrap was one of the best Greek wraps he's ever had. The only reason I give 4 instead of 5 is because the hummus I ordered as a side was extremely bland, I couldn't eat it. It had absolutely no seasoning or flavoring. And the falafel was a little bit dry, but still very flavorful and yummy in my salad with the Zikiz vinaigrette dressing. Overall will definitely be ordering from here again thanks to the speed of delivery and fresh, healthy ingredients!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! I must say I had my doubts but I have nothing but positive things to say. The food is very fresh. The staff is quite amicable. The atmosphere is also chill. It's a great place.   I had the salmon with tabouli, chick peas, kale, onions and cucumber in a bowl. I also had the Mango Curry and Chiptole sauces. It was all great. The fact that these are house sauces blows me away. I will certainly be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken salad. Why are you taking fresh meat off the skewer and putting it in liquid? Did you notice when you put the meat from the liquid to my salad, you didn't hardly drain it? So you added a bunch of water liquid chicken to my salad. It was soupy!  I really wanted to ask Edward for fresh meat from the skewer and not from that liquid, but he looked not happy. Edward seemed less than pleasant to take my ordered. Almost acted irritated. Would have given an additional star if he was nice.  Put Edward in the back chopping veggies. Make meat fresh and not in liquid and I will come back.  The other older gentlemen staff was so friendly and nice. Even thanked me for my business when he used my visa to ring up the order. Make him the front of the business!"}
{"text":"they pretend to be lebanese but only think they have is hummus from lebanon. and to be honest chicken and angus steak are really loq quality ones."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! This is my second visit and both meals have been so good!!! Friendly staff and clean facility!!! This place is a must try :)"}
{"text":"Great little place that just opened down the street from my neighborhood! Looks like its family owned and can definitely tell by the great and friendly service. Food is delicious, very healthy and fresh! A lot of options for a small salad wrap place. They just opened a few weeks ago so hopefully they can keep everything they have going strong in the future, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here because of reviews on yelp. I am real picky about trying new places. Fresh and delicious. Friendly peeps. VERY clean. Will return again."}
{"text":"Amazing. Fresh. Friendly. Reasonable. Definitely check this spot out.   They do a killer job!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for awhile. This place does wraps, rice bowls and salads. Service was great and very helpful. I tried the steak wrap was amazing, loved the rice hummus, and mango curry sauce. You customize and pick the goodies to go inside. Prices are good and they have Diet Dr Pepper ...bonus points for me"}
{"text":"i love coming to Zikis, its price is worth it. very fresh on their items, staffs are nice and always welcoming. It also has a coffee shop connected to it if incase you want to grab a cup of coffee and some pastry."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with ZiKiZ and found it because of its great reviews on Yelp. I'm normally a little reserved when it comes to trying new things like the concept they have going on here, but I'm so glad I finally gave this place a shot.   I had a bowl with ZiKiZ rice and steak. I added a little hummus and tabouli together with jalape√±os, tomatoes, red onions, green pepper. I topped it off with the ZiKiZ sauce that was a sort of garlic vinaigrette. After my first bite I was sold. All of the ingredients went so well together. And this is coming from a food \"separatist\". I'm never a \"mixer\" and now I may have to rethink that whole strategy because I've probably been missing out.  Thanks ZiKiZ for making me see the light. Speaking of light, the food here is lite and healthy. It's a refreshing change when eating fast food. They also sell some gluten free, protein enriched desserts which looked tempting. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We found this place completely on accident.   We were next door at Jamba Juice and it caught our eye.  We were greeted by 2 very friendly gentlemen.   I believe one may have been the owner.   He explained how to order.  You choose either a wrap, a salad or a hummus bowl.  I got the hummus, then you choose a protein I chose chicken.  From there you pick your extras.  So many to choose from.  It was inexpensive and delicious!  This is exactly the way I love to eat.  Clean, healthy and guilt free.  I will back... again and again!  Oh, one more thing, the \"ziki sauce\" is amaaaaaaazing! I hope they will think about selling it by the bottle!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, my husband and I live in mountains edge , I would pass by this place all the time saying to myself \"I want to go in there someday, today we decided to go and .... oh... my ... gosh. .... AMAZING!!!!!!!! My new favorites spot !!!!! Delicious food, then you walk to the next part of the place and its coffee and dessert! The atmosphere is great the coffee is so delicious too wow I'm impressed! Telling everyone I know FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Have gone many times since I live close by. Fresh and healthy! My kids love the hummus! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came in for a late lunch with little to no expectations besides the so-so reviews I saw on yelp, decided to try it anyway. Boy am I glad I did! Ordered the wheat wrap with chicken, rice hummus, cucumber ,chickpeas, mozzarella cheese, feta cheese and chipotle sauce and it was amazing. I will update my review on my second visit  and hopefully we can change the four stars to five."}
{"text":"Customer service was good and that's where my 2 stars come from. Worst hummus I've ever tasted. I sampled the beef and the piece they gave me was mostly fat and the little that wasn't fat was extremely bland. I had a chicken wrap. Chicken was bland. The ingredients were very fresh. I don't think I would ever come out of my way to come back."}
{"text":"My awesome FPIC brought me here and it didn't sadden my taste buds. This place is great with their health options of wraps and vegetarian options.   The place is nice and opened with a lot of natural light. It is welcoming and clean.  The fillings are abundant and they definitely made it packed with fresh goodness! I almost didn't finish it and originally when they were building my wrap,  I thought it was not enough but when I ate it.....I realized how much they put into the wrap. The sauce is really flavorful and so was the wrap itself! My FPIC had the chicken bowl and it was enjoyed quite a bit, so much so that there was no offering to share.   I will be back for more the next time I am there!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The staff is always friendly and courteous and the food is always on point.  This is where I go when I want to eat healthy but also still fill up on legit food.  I've only had the bowls and humus but they have always been great.  Fresh ingredients and a bunch of great sauces, my favorites are the hot sauce and Cesar combined, make this place great.  They also have good deals when you check in on Yelp!"}
{"text":"this place tastes good but everything is drenched in butter. so much butter! when you take the box home and stick it in the fridge, when u take it out, it is like a block of grease. so gross! it might taste delicious, but nobody should be consuming that much butter even in a week! also, nobody was standing in the service area because the whole crew was in back chatting and on their phones texting. i wanted to ask for a to go bag and ended up reaching over the counter to grab a bag myself because nobody came out when i hollered. the place was well maintained and the owner was nice when i was ordering, so it gets two stars."}
{"text":"It was my second time coming here...the first time was when they first opened, and i was not impressed...after a few months of being opened i figured they would have things together.......firstly i would like to specify that i LOVE their rice! it is soooooo delicious! and i made sure to compliment them on that fact several times........my biggest complaint that a bowl of rice, chick peas and some veggies is waaaaay over priced...but thats not the worst part.....my rice was SWIMMING in oil!!! if you look at the pictures that is all oil at the bottom of the bowl! it was like an oil soup! i ate as much of the surface rice as i could handle...it was too good to throw away...but it was soooo hard to eat any more.......i wish they would consider the fact that a vegetarian should not be charged the same amount as a meat eater...veggies are way cheaper than meat........paying almost $10 for a bowl of rice and veggies seems like robbery....yeah the rice is yummy(when its dry) but i will not be back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good wrap restaurants and was pleased to learn this place is across the street from my new workplace, so I entered with high hopes.  And ZiKiZ didn't disappoint. There's a good variety of protein offerings for the wraps and bowls -- I went with the chicken -- and they're accompanied by good side-dish options. If you're going to go with a side, go ahead and get a combo with a drink; it's a much better value that way.  I'm looking for a bit of an escape when having lunch, and because this place attracts a line at the counter and the seating is bunched close together, I don't always feel I get that. However, the big-screen TV plays ESPN, which is right up my alley and gives me something to gaze at other than queued-up diners' midsections.  A combo meal easily becomes two meals, as I'm not able to finish a wrap in one sitting, let alone a side with it. Kudos to the restaurant for having both hot sauce and jalapenos as toppings.  That said, the spicy sauce isn't all that hot, and I was surprised when I asked for extra spicy sauce recently and was told it'd cost a bit extra. Really? For something with the consistency of watery barbecue sauce? Are a couple of extra squirts of that really going to come up at the next shareholders meeting? The employee relented, for whatever reason, when he learned I was ordering a combo.  My other quibble is that the wraps are served on foil, even if you don't get them to go. I prefer to eat with a knife and fork, and I quickly tear through the foil when doing so. It'd be nice to have access to plates and spicier sauce. It also would be nice to get more than once small piece of pita bread with the hummus side.  Some of the employees are especially friendly. I'll definitely be back here many times."}
{"text":"Love the food and the price. The owner manager was great. It was clean and the people were very friendly. Can't wait to bring my teenagers to this Establishment."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The owners treat you like family. One of our favorite places to eat. A must try. You won't be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of this quick eatery. If you're in the mood for some quick and reasonably priced Mediterranean food ZiKiZ is a good option. It's like a Subway for Mediterranean food, but better because it's not Subway. You won't regret giving them a try."}
{"text":"Awesome little gyro joint across the street that I'm glad I found out about, very accommodating, vegan options which is great for my girlfriend and I. Gyro was good even when we showed up a little later in the night. Fries were good and the family enjoyed everything we ordered! Will have to go back soon and get lunch and try their baklava."}
{"text":"This place is so good! I had a spinach and herb wrap. With the grilled chicken, and zikiz dressing. It was so so good! Their hummus was yummy and fresh, they make their dressings from scratch. We will totally be going back again!"}
{"text":"Went in for a quick Greek salad.  No Greek salad on menu,  uggh.  Asked guy behind counter what was good and he said everything,  second uggh.  Anyways,  I just went with chicken gyro.  I wish I could be more positive about place, but,  if your name is zikiz you should at least have a mean tzatziki sauce. Sauce was Bland with little to no garlic bite.  This sauce should be life of party.   Maybe the sauce is bland for same reason most thai restaurants \"hot\" is not really hot.   Chicken had no flavor,  chicken on rotisserie was not ready and mine was taken from a container and heated up on flat top grill.  Finally,  guy who made my gyro took a handful of mushy tomatoes and placed on sandwich then in plain view took container to sink and drained off a cup or so of liquid.  Clean bright environment with big TVs."}
{"text":"Hands down awesome! From the great customer service, the cool atmosphere, and of course the fresh and delicious food! I had the euro bowl, and daaaanngggg it's amazing! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! It's not your authentic Mediterranean cuisine, but it's a good balance of both American and Mediterranean. I like that they have so many options on the meats, veggies, and the preparation i.e. Bowl, gyro, wraps, etc. I ordered two bowls and a wrap with gyro meat...all with different veggies. Their hummus is also really creamy and tasty. The prices are very affordable and they are generous with the portions. I'm so happy they finally opened a fast food joint in my area that doesn't taste like fast food and that's also different and unique! Also, the cashier (a blonde, young guy with his hair tied back) was also very courteous and helpful.  The only reasons I gave a 4 star are because I had previously gone and arrived around 8:30 PM and the man who was there turned me away and said they close at 9PM. This time I went, the girl that took my order made me feel a little rushed so I asked her what time they close, and she said between 8-9 depending on how busy they are. I don't know what kind of business turns people away an hour to half an hour before closing, but I guess business must be that good for them. Aside from that, it took a while to get my order but it was well worth it and I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit to the restaurant. My first being just a couple of days ago. That tells you that I had a great experience the first time. During my first visit we ordered a chicken kebab plate and a chicken tender kids meal. The chicken kebab plate takes 10 minutes because it's made fresh to order. The chicken kebab is a bit on the dry side (pretty standard for chicken breast) but it's pretty good with the zikiz sauce. The kids meal comes with fries but unfortunately we weren't able to eat any of it because they package it inside of a container with a lid. So without ventilation by the time we got home, the fries were completely soggy (trashed).   I went back today because I wanted to try the gyro plate and I wanted to introduce my husband to the chicken Kebab plate. Both plates come with a small bed of rice, hummus and Tabouli.. however, only the gyro plate comes with added lettuce, tomatoes and onions. When my husband asked for some topping on his plate as well, they told him it's usually an extra charge.  This was a surprise to me because the restaurant set up is like \"subway\" or \"chipotle\" where you go down the line and things are added to your food. I think being generous with rice portion, a few toppings or some sauce can make a big difference in the overall experience and how the customer feels leaving the restaurant. A little can go a long way.    I gave this place 4 stars because the food itself has good flavor and tastes great.  Side note: a combo (chicken & meat) dish would be great."}
{"text":"I've been going to the adjacent Cupz in the morning and decided to have lunch here today. The gentleman who made my custom order was very cool and I enjoyed our exchange. The people in front of me ordered wraps, which essentially came out as giant Greek burritos and they looked amazing. I ordered a custom bowl and while the falafel isn't the best I've ever had, I was very pleased... I suggest adding some Zikiz rice to your salad. I'll be back to try more things, especially because they enthusiastically waved goodbye to me when I was leaving (that sounds silly, but it made my day)."}
{"text":"Delicious. Glad we found this place (thanks, Yelpers!) -- we visited twice in three days. The hummus was tasty and the Zikis rice is so good. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh love th flavor very friendly staff  love the falafel bowl with zikiz rice :) definitly recommended ! Will come back again"}
{"text":"This place is soooo delicious!!!! If you love Mediterranean food this is the one to eat at The Falafel is crisp on the outside and soft inside with such a great bold flavor. I also tried the Mango Curry dressing on my rice bowl and it was the best dressing I've ever had Also, the owner/manager is so inviting and helpful, what a nice guy. Go out of your way to try this place..you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Lately I've been craving good Mediterranean food and luckily Zikiz opened up near us. The food was very good. Now being a vegetarian it's sometimes hard to find GOOD veggie options. Now based off of what my boyfriend has told me about their menu (he went and ordered the food for us) there are plenty of vegetarian options. I'll definitely be returning there myself and trying out more of their food. Other then that it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Had a veggie wrap with Hummus. It's was a large portion and super delicious! Fresh food and the owners are great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Zikiz twice and it's always been a great experience! The food is really delicious and you can tell that the staff are very passionate about what they do. The rice is one of the owners family recopies and it's so good in a falafel wrap! Good fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"I am totally a fan of this place.  I was brought to this place because I heard it accepted Bitcoin.  If not for that I would not have ever came here but I'm glad I did.  Essentially this is middle-eastern version of Chipotle.  Still getting used to it but it is fresh, the staff was extremely accommodating and paying with Bitcoin was a lot of fun and was completely painless.  Also, they have good options for vegetarians and vegans.  I mean this place wants your business and I got the sense that a lot of regulars keep coming back (I will surely be back with Bitcoin).  UPDATE: Upgrading from a 4 to 5 stars because I went again and the service was just great."}
{"text":"We stopped in for our first time this afternoon and were duly impressed.  The employees were extremely attentive and the place was SPOTLESS.  We ordered two traditional gyros and one wild salmon wrap.  Not only were our meals delicious, but the portions were so generous that we took half home!  We have been hoping for a restaurant in this price range to pop up in our area, and this is going to become a regular spot for us.  Kid-friendly and very beautiful location."}
{"text":"Salad was excellent the steak was so good filled with flavor. The two guys working I think father and son were so friendly with everyone that came in. I be back that's for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in here yesterday honestly to use the restroom and get a drink. I had dropped my phone off next door for a battery change. Ended up checking out the menu and decided to get an early lunch. The owner was so sweet in explaining everything to me and making recommendations, even gave us an extra dressing to try and seemed very proud of it while he told me about it. I ordered a salad for myself and a rice bowl for my daughter. Was very excited that their food was all VERY fresh looking and they had both spinach and kale as options!   The food tasted even better than it looked. I was shocked at how fresh it tasted!! The place was really clean. The prices are more than fair for what you get. I for sure will be recommending this place to anyone that asks for something healthy and super tasty to eat in the area. We will be frequent customers I'm sure!!"}
{"text":"I was about to grab a sandwich at Brooklyn Bagel when I noticed this place. I love Mediterranean food, so I thought this would be an interesting place to check out since it a casual little spot. I was greeted and walked through the process of ordering. It's basically the way you order at Chipotle. You pick your carb, meat and toppings. They have two spits, one roasting steak and the other chicken. I went with the steak wrap and added hummus, ZiKiZ dressing and the usual Med toppings to basically make myself a salad in a wrap. The steak was delicious. Not dry and had good flavor. I definitely would stop back by if in the area. Just wish they had room for one more spit to do lamb."}
{"text":"I have been going to Zikiz since they opened in Henderson!  Probably once or twice a week for at least a year.  The staff was amazing and knew me by name.  The food is always great.  The new locatjon is beautiful and i cant wait to try more of the new options!!!  Worth trying, cant wait to try Cupz, too"}
{"text":"1. choose your meal (wrap, salad or bowl) 2. Add a protein (falafel, chicken, steak or salmon) 3. pick fresh toppings (banana pepper, red onion, pickles, chick peas, green pepper, mozzarella, olives, tomato, jalapeno, cucumber, tabouli or feta) 4. add sauce or dressing (zikiz dressing, mango curry, chipotle, Asian bbq, hot sauce, ranch or Caesar and GO! :) they also offer salads, French fries, sweet potato fries, hummus, and rice. Drinks are fountain drinks, coconut water, green tea, bottled water or bottle drinks. For dessert: fresh baked chocolate chip cookies. A wrap will set you back: $6.25 same for a Salad -- a bowl is $6.75. I really like this place the falafa is great!"}
{"text":"Yep this place is good. Ziki rice bowl with their signature sauce is money. Prices are good and you can order online and have it ready when you get there. Wish it was open later on Sunday though!"}
{"text":"Wow! Very tasty steak burrito, no grizzle! Price is worth it! You pay for the freshness and quality! Looks clean inside and there's music playing inside. Will definitely be back! The cashier was friendly and the manager even asked how our food was!"}
{"text":"If you have not yet tried it, it's a must! Quality inhredients, great flavor and two sold thumbs up!   Go Buckeyes!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at ZiKiZ and I love it here! They are across the street from work and they have delicious and healthy bowls. I have yet to try the wraps but I'm sure they're delicious too. This concept is like Chipotle except it's a Mediterranean twist. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great flavor to their food. The owner was exceptionally nice. I told him it was my first time in and he gave me a free drink. I love the hummus and the portions are big. I ordered the gyro plate and had enough left over for dinner. Solid greek spot."}
{"text":"Healthy lunch options. Love their Spinach bowl with chicken. Delicious!! They have wraps, salads & bowls. Gyros are good too. Very clean and Family owned. They have a new location on Blue Diamond Rd."}
{"text":"I'm so happy the options in Mountains Edge are expanding! This place has a healthy Mediterranean vibe and you pick your meals in a Chipotle-esque fashion. Although the healthy options are abundant there are some darn good fried options as well. I love how personable and friendly the staff is here! Plus it seems like a family owned and ran sort of affair, which I love supporting!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the price is good, but the service is lackluster and the employees are pretty vacant. Feel pretty ignored by most people in the store. Bad communication, had to ask for parts of my order as I was checking out because they weren't made.   And the manager or owner...just kinda stares at you or stands over the shoulder of the workers. The guy makes me pretty uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Great food. Nice family run operation. This is a must try place that you'll make it back often. Quality food and great service  . 5 stars in my book ."}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in the door, the wonderful smells of their food accosted me. I'm a huge fan of falafels and hummus and theirs is so tasty! The hummus is smooth and perfect, the falafels done just right. So much to choose from, I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I will absolutely come here again. After reading the reviews, I figured that I should stop see and see what the buzz was about. Thank you Yelpers, because this restaurant is worth a visit!  I am gluten free due to an allergy, not by choice, so I appreciated a staff who understood the allergy and was very thoughtful in preparing my food. They have rice if you would like a rice bowl and a salad option. The hummus is smooth and silky, the chicken is light and not overly seasoned, the ingredients are all fresh and the restaurant is very clean.  Put it all together with a very friendly staff, wonderful owner who definitely cares about the quality of his job and the product he gives to his customers, and gluten free falafel (YUMMY!), I am hooked!  If you're vegetarian, gluten sensitive or just want a nice light lunch that won't make you bloat like a blimp, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The older balding guy with the goatee was a dickwad. Literally wanted to leave because of him. Wish I got his name so I could mention him. Usually I'll return somewhere if the food is mediocre  but the service is good, but thanks to that guy I think I'll pass. Maybe if he was nicer the business wouldn't be so dead empty. Not to mention the hummus was butthole. Try less tahini next time."}
{"text":"Fast service but foid just didn't wow me. Basically looks like another chipotle knockoff with their take on greek food. Wasnt really crazy that the guy grilling the chicken used same pan that he used when chicken was raw to serve me in. Behind the counter looked a little dirty . Overall another medicore fast food place."}
{"text":"Good food and large portions!  The owners are there often and the employees are clean & friendly.   Coming from the Food & Beverage Industry myself, I couldn't help but watch intently while the associate prepared our plates & accepted payment. Every glove switch eased my mind.   After enjoying our lunch we went next door to the Bakery & Coffee shop associated with Zikiz. The pastries were tempting, but we decided to save that for another time and grab a coffee instead. We will be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the Service! Chicken on spinach wrap tasted like it was just made fresh and even with the ingredients to choose from you can make it even tastier. To those who say chicken and rice were bland maybe you should try and add dressing or humus because alone it was totally fine for me. My wrap tasted better than anything at chipotle btw and that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"The best deal in town! Simple to order, friendly staff and fresh, delicious food make ZiKiZ a winning combination in my Yelp world. I ordered a salad with spinach, lettuce, falafel, hummus and tons of other veggies... so yummy!!! They offer several different dressings, I chose the house dressing which was olive oil based and super good. It paired perfectly with the veggies and was full of herbs, but not overpowering in flavor. My sweetie ordered a chicken wrap and raved about the ZikiZ rice that was packed inside. My favorite part of this quick service restaurant is that the owner is amazing. He is welcoming and friendly. I feel that he genuinely cares about his customers and that they enjoy their meal.     I am happy to add ZikiZ to my dining out rotation."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when I searched \"healthy\" on the Yelp app... I know, creative.  I was dead set on not cooking, but didn't want to completely derail my diet.  Desperate times call for desperate measures.  So after bookmarking about 38 protein, salad, and healthy eats I decided to give this one a try because it was the closest to where I lived.  I went in and was pleasantly surprised.  The store and prep area are both very, very clean!  The staff was extremely friendly and patient with me as it took a hot minute for me to decide what I was in the mood for.    My favorite part about this place is that you are in complete control of what is going in your meal from start to finish.  Normally I don't like wrap places because there is always at least one thing in the wrap I don't like (I am relatively picky when it comes down to it) and then I end up getting something boring and lack luster.  At ZiKiZ, you choose whether you want a wrap, salad, or bowl.  You choose what kind of wrap (regular, wheat, or spinach) and you dictate EXACTLY what goes into it.  My picky eating habits were in heaven.  I got to choose everything I enjoyed and leave out all the rest.  I was double excited to find out that they have a Chipotle sauce that was AWESOME and most places don't offer.  This place is also pretty affordable.  For about $11 I got a wrap, side, and drink.  And, I could only finish about half of the wrap so I took the second half to work for lunch the next day.  Two meals for $11??  You can't beat that.    If you are looking for a healthy alternative and don't feel like cooking, you should definitely check this place out!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing place . We couldn't believe how good it was clean fresh the chicken and beef very tasty and juicy I love this place hummus very good and great tasting"}
{"text":"Wrap me up and take me home ZiKiZ. Your food is BoMb. (I don't know why their name has a capital K in the middle. I almoSt wAnT to wriTe the WhOle rEviEw this way, but I'm too full now.)  Back to the wraps. Your choice of Steak, Chicken or Crab mix or Falafel and 4 types of tortillas you can wrap it in. Or if you aren't a wrapper you could make it into a salad or a bowl. This is your meal so make your food dreams come true.   Add: spinach, rice (white or brown), lettuce mix, olives, tomatoes, red onion, jalapeno, pickles, cucumbers, chick peas, green peppers, banana peppers, avocado, feta or mozzarella ($.99 extra for cheese), crumbled ZiKiZ chips.   Dressing: I want to try them all! A house dressing that's good, Chipotle Ranch, Asian BBQ, Citrus, Hot Sauce, Mango Curry, Caesar, Vinaigrette. I only wish they had a Tzatziki sauce.  Wraps $7.99 Salads $8.49 Bowls $8.49 (they even have Tabouli!)  This is one of those meals that you can make healthy or kill it with the carbs depending your mood that day. I like that. Did I mention they have a cheesecake wrap? Tubby didn't try that, but it sure sounded good especially since you can choose chocolate, lemon or strawberries as your topping. Might as well rip the drawstring out of your pants to make some more room.   I ordered online and like the fact they have the nutritional guidelines on there. Not that I even want to know about the cheesecake wrap.... Wait, strawberries are an exceptional source of antioxidants:)   If you haven't got the memo yet ZiKiZ is doing it big up in here. Fresh, simple and have it your way. If you like to be your own boss of what you eat than check it out."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving a 4 instead of a 5 is their employees are still learning since it is new and service is a little slow still.  Have been here 3 times already.  We have tried the gyro, chicken and falafel wraps, gyro and falafel plates, fried pickles and sweet potato fries.  All were very tasty. We enjoyed the falafel.  They are very flavorful. The tzaziki sauce and the Ziki Dressing are both yummy.  I wasn't a fan of the tabouleh, it was very heavy on the parsley and I prefer couscous to the wheat bulgar."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Everything is very fresh. Best humus ever. I'm not a fan and wouldn't touch the stuff but they make it amazing.  Great personal service you don't feel herded through a line. They great a wonderful meal and show you the best deal for your meal. Very clean. Free Wifi. They deliver."}
{"text":"Had the chicken kabob plate and it was good. The homemade hummus is the best I've had so far - lots of choices for veggies and sides. You can tell they were still ironing out some keeps operationally but good customer service for the most part."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. I will totally be a regular here.   I do think there are some missed opportunities, however. Beets!!! Kalamata olives. Taziki sauce!!!! With a name like Zikis, you'd think they would have an amazing traditional taziki sauce! TOASTED pita bread."}
{"text":"Omg!!! So good I must say, I had my doubts because of many bad experiences before at Greek/American places but, the staff were friendly, the food was awesome. Order the falafel spinach& herb wrap oh my that was no wrap that's a burrito sooo good my husband has the beef gyro and loved it order a side of hummus and pita bread couse I tried it and it was just too delish to not to get the side."}
{"text":"At the time of writing this review, Zikiz is a relatively new fast-casual Greek/Mediterranean restaurant that opened in the Southwest part of town. Think Chipotle, but for Gyros and Salads.   They follow the Chipotle formula to a tee: you pick your dish (wrap, salad, or bowl), your protein (falafel, chicken, gyro, salmon), then add toppings and dressing. Aside from this, Zikiz also offers regular gyros and gyro plates.   Getting to the good stuff, the food is really good! The gyro meat is tasty, and there's something about their tzaziki sauce that I find particularly addicting. They also have a variety of French fries that range from normal to garlic herb.   I was excited to try the garlic herb fries, but because the place is still relatively new and was trying to get everything squared away, they had a lack of efficiency in their execution, which resulted in a longer than expected wait time, and my order being partially incorrect (I received regular fries instead of the garlic herb, not realizing until I got home).   Overall, the food is great, and it's nice to have a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant on this side of town. I think once they've been open a bit longer, they'll have the workflow ironed out much more smoothly, creating a better customer experience. But that aside, it's definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"I noticed ZiKiZ while in the area a couple months ago and decided to bookmark it based on the positive reviews and the food sounded good. I met yelper Tracy P here for lunch and walking in we were greeted right away. The 2 men behind the counter were very friendly and told us about their menu. They said they specialized in customizing any order with what's offered on the menu. You pick if you want a wrap, salad or bowl (prices vary) and then pick what you want inside. They have chicken, steak, crab and falafel and a variety of veggies.   Priced at $7.99 I ordered a \"Chicken Wrap\" with salad mix, red onion, black olives, tomatoes, cucumbers, ZiKiZ sauce and feta cheese (.50 cents extra for feta) inside a sundried tomato tortilla. I said that I would be eating the wrap inside, but would like the chicken on the side to-go. The guy looked at me kind of funny and said I needed to pick a protein to go into my meal. I looked funny back at him because he just told me a minute prior that they specialized in customizing any order, so what was the big deal with just putting the chicken on the side? I like the Greek Salad Wrap over at The Great Greek on Warm Springs and was hoping to create a wrap somewhat like that. I just said the chicken inside the wrap would be fine. My friend, Tracy had a coupon for $5 off any order over $20 which was a nice bonus. The guy accepted the coupon with no problem, but he majorly messed up when it came to ringing up our order. We wanted to add 2 sides and 2 drinks for an additional $2.99 each. He never asked us what sides we wanted and when we were looking over the menu deciding which ones we wanted, he says \"oh I thought you'd want fries\" and I was wondering why he was picking for us. I said no, we never asked for fries and don't want those, but we'd like to try the ZiKiZ rice. He then brought only 1 side of rice over and not the 2nd. Then he starts to talk to the next customer and we haven't even received our drink cups. I ask for them and he only hands 1 cup over. What the heck? We mentioned that we needed the other drink (deciding to just give up on the 2nd side we never received) and he just smiles and hands a cup over. I wasn't given a receipt, so I don't know how he charged me. I am thinking he didn't ring up the 2nd drink and side or something, but with the coupon our total was only $15 and some change, so not a bad price to try a new place out.   He did give the coupon back and said to save it to use again.  The rice was very bland. I really tasted no flavor and decided since it was in a container already to just take it home and give it to my dog with her dinner. The wrap was just average. I did like the taste of the tortilla, but the chicken really had no flavor and the veggies stood out more as far as flavor goes. With them not customizing my order the way I wanted, the food only tasting average, the mix up with sides and drinks and the food not being that great, I can't see coming back."}
{"text":"Tried this place after a few friends wanted to check it out. The place is basically like a subway, but with Mediterranean ingredients. I ordered the chicken burrito with the sundried tomato tortilla (because it sounded so cool) and got a combo. For my side I choose a whole wheat pita which came with a big container of hummus and a fountain drink. The price for the burrito was about $7.99 and making a meal into a combo was an additional $2.99.   I felt that the place was overpriced after I got my food because the burrito was pretty small and I only got one small pita bread with a tub of hummus. I have no idea why they gave me so much hummus for my bread so I ended up slathering my burrito in hopes of using it all up. I currently still have about 3/4 of the container full of hummus. Then again, the price was probably a bit higher because of the types of ingredients they have here. My burrito was decent in terms of taste. The chicken was dry so I used the hummus from my side order to add some moisture and taste. I got the Zikiz special sauce, but the flavor did not stand out to me. I'm glad I tried this place once, but I am not sure if I would go back. Luckily, the plaza has plenty of other restaurants in case I am ever in the area.  Overall, this place and the food was a good experience, but there wasn't much that wowed me. It was nice that they had a Yelp check-in deal where you can get $2 off when you spend $10 or more (which shouldn't be too hard to do haha). After I finished my food, I was kind of hungry still and was just overwhelmed with hummus. I guess if you really love hummus, you should check this place out. If not, check out another place!"}
{"text":"I was just here for the first time and can't wait to go back again, their food is so fresh and I love that it's custom. The staff was so friendly and welcoming where most people rush you out during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"I never heard of this restaurant until I moved to the area. I was looking for something healthy that wasn't a salad or a sandwich. I decided on a wrap with the steak. Well, let's just say I understand why you need the sauces. The meat was totally flavorless. Bland. To make it better I heated it up in a microwave at home. The special rice was not so special, basically Rice A Roni. But the worst thing was the terribly cooked sweet potato fries. At least half of them in my order were undercooked. The service was nice, fast and friendly. However, I think the food was overrated."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me, so I tried it out. I only tried their beef (they call it Angus steak), vegetables, tabbouleh and rice with vermicelli.    The service was very friendly and it looks like a very clean place. I felt like the meat was extremely overcooked. My friend had the chicken and she said the same thing. I really liked the tabbouleh.   I'm not in a hurry to go back. I would like to have the meat less like a pot roast texture and more like slices from a kabob, if that makes sense. I would also like to see more vegetables."}
{"text":"I came here in search of the Hawaiian place that use to be here. I ended up finding something even better! The staff were prompt and polite. I got the mahi mahi bowl. The Zikiz sauce was delicious. Everything tastes fresh and good. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Oh, my! I stumbled on to this place for lunch and ordered a salad ( $7.99). You choose the meat and toppings. Everything made fresh including original recipe salad dressing.  Can add hummus and a variety of Greek style toppers and cheeses. So flavorful!  I will make this shop a regular stop!"}
{"text":"I was honestly blown away by their ZiKiZ Rice Bowl, I had to go back the next day for seconds!!  Not sure if it is the ZiKiZ Rice, Sauce or Hummus, but it was truly one of the best bowls I've ever had.  Hope this place stays popular, as I know I'll be coming back for some every time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious, good portions, well-priced, I had the hummus plate with chicken. It was so good with the fresh tabouli."}
{"text":"Zikiz has yet to disappoint me. Consistency is key and they've got it. Friendly service and great food every single time. I love love love did I mention love their wraps.   I get the spinach wrap with extra chicken instead of rice, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, banana peppers, hummus and hot sauce. Holy crap I'm salivating just thinking about it. Their hummus and hot sauce are made in house and the flavors blend perfectly give it a try. They also have a citrus green tea which is pretty delicious.   Give them a try, I have no idea why people aren't lining up for this place but it just makes the time between walking in and inhaling my wrap that much faster."}
{"text":"Awesome modern Mediterranean place, they're all about quality and fresh ingredients, savory gyros wraps and platters. Must try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"The falafel is not fresh and clearly not made there. They heat it up but it's clearly made by a machine and frozen )); sad because falafel is so simple to make.   There is no yogurt sauce or tahini sauce..just ranch and chipotle barbecue and salad dressings..strange pairing for a Mediterranean place.   We were here at 3:25pm and they started closing up while we were eating. Shut all the lights off and locked things up. They weren't supposed to close until 6pm...   They were also really stingy with the fries and tabbouleh.   Idk not much going for this place other than it's different for vegas. So expensive too for what it is."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and it's great seeing them knowing few guests by first named basis. Food is amazing and very fresh. Would highly suggest anyone checking this place out"}
{"text":"Ok where is the tzatziki sauce? They don't carry it! Had the rice bowl and it was just that.. lots of mushy rice. I ordered the chicken and they hardly put any meat. The chicken tasted like tuna. Really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Love that everything is made to order and build your own.  The hummus is a must!  The management was very friendly and genuinely seemed to care about our experience."}
{"text":"The bowls are filling and fairly healthy.  A great fast food restaurant.  Service is good too!"}
{"text":"Ordered with uber. Wife's wrap had no flavor, dried over cooked chicken and no sauce.   My falafel bowl was horrible. The falafel was cold, over-cooked, dry, and hard. The bowl was heavy, because it was 94% hummus / 6 lbs of hummus. The hummus was also mixed or thinned with what smells and tastes like mayonnaise. The olives you think would be kalamata, nope! Basic nasty cheap black olives.   I asked for whole wheat pitas and got white. The pitas were also dry and gave me heart burn. Inside the bowl was literally no additions. They couldn't fit very much due to the cement bag size of hummus mayonnaise that is included. The falafels were also not ball shaped as customary, they were flat hockey pucks. Due to the horrible cooking and prep procedure they could be used as hockey pucks too.   Do not eat here, waste of my $30!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great wrap! Nice new place. Excellent food, customer service and very clean. Reasonable prices. Will be back often."}
{"text":"First time here and I ordered a Bowl (Gyro, zikiz rice, hummus, spinach, onions, and two times the tomatoes) and asked for the zikiz dressing on the side. Let me just say the yelpers weren't kidding for those that said it is TASTY! My bowl is absolutely delicious! I'll definitely be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for YELP! Was in the neighborhood & this is the 1st place to pop up on Yelp. So, we have it a try, especially since they have a Yelp coupon. Tried chicken bowl with zikiz sauce, my friend had same but with falafel, & order of zikiz fries. Everything was very good! Priced ok for Mediterranean. No tzatziki tho. :( We'd eat there again. Great service!"}
{"text":"Just happen to stumble across this place since we starting staying on this side of town, the place is never really busy but don't let that fool ya! My boyfriend and I had went there 4 times in two weeks, it is just so good and fresh. I always get the bowl with lamb and humans and other toppings and he gets it in a wrap form.  The price is always exactly $20. Not too bad considering I can eat my bowl for two meals. They have started a reward program and you just give them your phone number and you get points and deals once a week! Staff is nice and always attentive."}
{"text":"Food is super fresh! Finally something healthy around my block. I just wish there was something open late thats moderately healthy besides Tropical Smoothie. The wraps and gyros are amazing! The only gripe I have is on the fried pickles. Too much fried batter barely any pickle inside (plus they were expensive)!"}
{"text":"I didn't care for this place it was not traditional in my opinion. Very store bought tasting"}
{"text":"I love this place! There is nothing out there quite like it. Their hummus is amazing and I love the sweet potato fries as well. The owners are so nice and make you feel right at home. I usually get a bowl with the chicken and add all my favorite toppings plus some ZiKiZ dressing and start eating :-) Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Quick clean and light. Try their side dish everyone homemade."}
{"text":"The son of the owner who helped me prepare my food came out rude. But his dad was really nice. Other than that, I loved the steak wrap I got! Or should I say \"burrito\" LOL it was very tasty and huge!!! Thanks Zikkiz! Will definitely be back when I come back to Vegas!!"}
{"text":"We've visited this place several times. The employees are always kind and the food is of good quality. My only complaint would be the falafel is a bit dry."}
{"text":"This food is delicious! It is home-made. I love the Tabouli, Humus, Chicken and Rice. I get the bowl made exactly how I want it, sometimes with chicken or just vegetarian. A great price and quick service too. It is so much better than that packaged, processed stuff from the grocery stores. My whole family finds something here, cause they love the wraps. I have even ordered and taken home a huge family size bowl to go of their hummus and tabouli and added them to our meal at home. Great for company or to take to  somebody's house! Try it, you will get hooked on this indulgent yet healthy food that is mild that you and your family will crave!"}
{"text":"I have always saw this place and wondered if it was good. So, I went today  to try them for dinner. I got me zikiz rice bowl with salmon (olives, feta cheese, zikiz oil and red onions) it was actually really really good. I even saved some for tomorrow's lunch :) next I am going to try the wrap! The guy even gave me a sample of their humus and he was very helpful  (I hate humus) and surprisingly wasn't that bad. I also used a coupon for $2 off $10 for checking in. It's like a dollar more for the salmon and I think .50 cents or something for extra other toppings. Was little expensive but you get a lot and I also got a good size green tea. Go try them ;)"}
{"text":"I consider myself a Greek fanatic. If I have a choice of food, I always choose Greek. This location is new so it is very clean and you can watch the people make your food. In some respects it is set up as like a \"chipotle\" of Greek food. I had the wrap with gyro meat and it was good. The Zikiz sauce was a yummy bonus.   They fell short on their sides which,  for me, is why I love this style of cuisine. They didn't have the traditional Greek salad and their hummus was super bland. The pita bread lacked any real flavor and kind of seemed like they didn't heat them properly. I think if they work on a few key elements, it could be 4 stars but for now it's definitely a 3 for me."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Think Chipotle with a Mediterranean spin...but all around better and more options to choose from! You can pick your meal (bowl, wrap, salad, plate), your base and your meat, and all the toppings and dressings/sauces you want. They cook the meat fresh right when you order.   I had a salad with chicken, hummus, and all the toppings, and my husband had a chicken wrap. We also had a side of hummus and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty delicious so far. I can't wait to come back. I'm torn between 4 and 5. I would give a solid 4.5. My only complaint was that the fries were so salted that I couldn't finish them.   I had a wrap on Spanish tortilla with gyro meat, rice, humus, spinach, olive, tomato, tabouli(however that's spelled), feta, and some delicious sauce. It was a fat Mediterranean burrito!   For my side I had the garlic fries. They are just French fries with a garlic salt seasoning. Like I mentioned before, they were tasty, but overly salted. Like, half the amount would still be more than what McDonald's puts on their fries. Easy fix though, just ask for light seasoning.  I didn't try the falafel, but I definitely will next time I'm in!"}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has good reviews it's overpriced, dry, and tasteless."}
{"text":"The food quality and service here have significantly improved since my last visit here! ZiKiZ is a Mediterranean Chipotle (Except ZiKiZ is way better than Chipotle) Get the whole wheat tortilla burrito, ZiKiZ rice, chicken, hummus, chick peas, tabbouleh, tomatoes, mozarella cheese. Add whatever else you want, but those are a must!  The food might taste bland to some, but I think it has a light, \"healthy\" taste.  The burrito is packed fuller than the bowl (even though the bowl is more expensive), but I like the texture and the way the food comes together better in the bowl.  $2 off your $10 order with a Yelp check-in? Even more of a reason to drop in!"}
{"text":"This place is far better than any wrap or sub place in all of Vegas. Go here, you won't be disappointed. Ask for Zikiz fries"}
{"text":"Had lunch bowl today at ZikiZ and super yummy! The steak was nice and tender, the mango curry sauce SO tasty. My husband got a steak wrap on sundried tomato tortilla. Will definitely go back! Nice healthy meal that tasted really good- tough for a lot of places to get right."}
{"text":"Must try! Exactly what Mts Edge needed! Yummy salads, delish dressing (zikiz is fantastic) and fresh meat. The pricing is perfect to the portion sizes."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food, fresh, flavorful, and healthy! You can choose what you put in a wrap, bowl, salad, etc. So, so yummy!! And the owner is very personable!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick lunch option that was somewhat healthy after shopping at Smith's in the same parking lot. I thought about calling in my usual Crazy Pita order, but I remembered that I wanted to try Zikiz.   The ordering style is like Chipotle. You choose between a wrap, bowl, or salad. Then you choose items like rice, protein, toppings, and dressing. I opted for a bowl with chicken, lettuce, olives, feta (extra charge), Zikiz rice, and Zikiz sauce. My favorite part was the rice which had a nice flavor. The chicken was plain, but I get that maybe it's meant to be that way since it gets mixed with so many other flavors. The Zikiz sauce was basically a vinaigrette and worked well with the other flavors. If I return I'll definitely take advantage of the vegetable options more like the cucumbers, tomatoes, and onion so that the bowl isn't so rice heavy.  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't overly friendly either. A major perk of this spot is that getting food is a fast process since everything is already made. This was actually the perfect stop that day since I had a car full of groceries and needed something quick. The jury is still out on how I feel about the price. Initially it seemed a little pricey, but the bowl was more filling than it looked.   Overall, the food was A-OK, but not the most exciting option in the area. It does seem to be one of the healthier options for the area though."}
{"text":"I like their gyros. I have to ask for meat and tzatziki sauce to go on first which is traditional. They usually put the meat on last and it falls out.  I find the prices to be a little high. $8 for a gyro and no sides or drink.  The tables are usually cleared but not wiped off (this is my experience after 2 visits).  There's a really thin woman who works their and I saw her wipe down all the tables at one point. She also called me by name andasked me if I liked my food and later cleared my tray. I was impressed (wish I had gotten her name).  The manager (or owner?) doesn't have a natural customer service flair but he gets the job down and is polite.  I recommend this place even with my minor concerns."}
{"text":"The menu is very simple and small but the food is great. Fresh ingredients and lots of veggie options. I got the Falafel Wrap and it was one of the best I have ever had. Their Zikiz Dressing is delicious! Also, their fried pickles are amazing! I definitely recommend this restaurant for a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"It's like the Chipotle of Mediterranean wraps/bowls/salads . I always get their chicken which is tender and juicy.  You get to choose from a variety of stuff to put in your wrap/bowl/salad.  Since it's customizable to your liking, there's not too much that can go wrong Lol.  I finish it with their Zikiz dressing which complements their food exceptionally.  Service is quick and friendly.   I noticed they have salmon as a protein option so I may get that one of these days."}
{"text":"First time coming here but won't be my last.  Although they have a limited amount of food options what makes the difference is the taste and preparedness of the food, absolutely delicious.  I recommend the sticky brown rice with chicken added in it, mouth watering"}
{"text":"First time there everything is very fresh.  It's salads and wraps with cooked to order meats. The dressings are made freshly as well. I loved the big portions too. Recommend this place to anyone who likes fresh tasting Mediterranean salads and wraps. Good prices too."}
{"text":"Yeah, not really a huge fan of this place.  Ordering style is like Chipotles.  The food was decent, and satisfactory, but I am always looking for above average, and I just don't see this place getting there.  I don't think its was just a matter of trying again. I think that it is just a so-so place/menu/flavor.  I probably will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is the Mediterranean version of Chipotle and they even have salmon ! :D If your looking for awesome hummus this is the place to come. Picture is of my amazing salmon bowl creation :p"}
{"text":"Great place.. I feel like subway is reinvented. Subway like set up but a lot better food. Amazing selection!  I love how you can order your own wrap and they make it fresh for you. I will definitely come back here!  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch! I had the spinach & herb chicken wrap. Ask to try the sauces, I had chipotle. It had a mild spice, a little smokiness and tang to it. Went great with my wrap. I look forward to my next visit and trying out a new sauce for my wrap!"}
{"text":"This is the worse Mediterranean food I've had in Vegas so far. The rice and the hummas were the only things I liked. They have their meet roasting on a spit behind the counter. But when the meat is done cooking, they throw it in a pot of water. So what would've been nice roasted meat turns into soggy grey steak. The zikiz sauce is like an Italian Vingarette that I'm sure would go great on a salad but not on anything else. The flavor was weird, the texture was bad and the price was really high what you get. The guy also over charged us. If you get a bowl you're supposed to be able to ad a side of hummas and pita for an extra $0.50, no he charged us for the combo instead which was an extra $3.50. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5, but a useful addition to the neighborhood, glad to have more healthy food options.  Portions are just right (for me - if you're a big guy you probably want to order a side).  House made dressings are flavorful but the amount is a little stingy (you can order extra though).  Meat is decent quality, the gyro is the most tasty.  For fast food, I am satisfied, but it's not the best Greek place ever or anything.  Like Chipotle, it's just a really fast and convenient go-to, with higher than average health value."}
{"text":"So I started my internship this week up in Henderson & was looking around for a healthy lunch around the area. Zikiz was the first place that popped up on Yelp. It had plenty of good reviews so I figured why not.   I was greeted by a young man upon entrance. This establishment is very similar to chipotle - only Mediterranean style. The first step is to pick your base - rice, salad, or wrap. I opted for a salad. I did overhear some lady saying that their rice is good so maybe I'll have to try that next time! I'm trying my best to stay away from any red meat or poultry so I chose the salmon. The guy told me that they grill their salmon and add some salt & pepper. Then you choose your mix-ins like cucumber, tomatoes, and all that good stuff. Thennnn you get to pick a sauce. I had the zikiz sauce, which is their own vinaigrette. To my surprise, the salmon was actually very very good. The salad was very light & refreshing.   I've actually had this place bookmarked for quite some time but just never wanted to make the drive. Now that I'm interning down the street, I'll be back more often!"}
{"text":"I always eat here for lunch, good food, affordable, and always greeted by Travis. I recommend the chicken and brown rice wrap with green peppers, hummus and the combo with Zikiz and chipotle sauce. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I've seen this place quite a few times but have never gone in, but I'm glad that I did.  Nice, new and clean restaurant. I didn't have to wait for long to place my order. The guy who took my initial order was a cutie,ha,so definitely no complaints. Anyway back to the food, very fresh and flavorful. I got a chicken and beef wrap and I was very happy with my purchase.I live so close I should have come here a long time ago. I'm definitely glad I tried this peace and I will return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Customer service is friendly. The food is delicious and healthy. One of my favorites along Blue Diamond Road. A+"}
{"text":"Been here once and will define return. The wrap I had was so good. I'm vegetarian so I had a rice/falafel wrap with the Mango Curry sauce and it was unbelievable. I'm bringing my husband there. We found a new spot!!! Staff is very friendly and the place was clean! Two thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"We need more local places like Zikiz in this part of town. So I will do everything I can to make sure that they get good ratings for their food and service. When I feel like a burrito is just too heavy, I will come here for my \"healthier version.\" The wraps are built similar to subways conveyor belt style but I never complain about portions being small or flavors missing like at Subway. I wish I could say this was my favorite wrap (which I have still yet to find) so this is why I will leave it with four strong stars."}
{"text":"They are really awesome.  I thought they were a chain, only to find out they only have one location. Owners are always on site and are typically the ones who are serving you. Food  is hot and fresh. It is not very expensive and you never have to wait long."}
{"text":"I loved Zikis when they first opened. The food was yummy, fresh and healthy. I like getting a side of hummus and pita bread as well.  Recently though, I feel like their servings and quality of food has gone down. The servings are less. I use to order a side of hummus and they give you a tubful. Now its half the tub and the pita bread is so thin that its rubbery to eat. Not good. Last 2 trips there, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I guess I was expecting better... inside it looked and felt very much like a chain (in a bad way), they should have made it look cooler, it's very plain. I got a bowl with Chicken, the chicken was so so. I got hummus in my bowl... don't get hummus in your bowl. The Curry sauce is good though! At the end of the day though it was a bowl of cheap food for $11, including the drink.... thats just too much for a rice bowl, ya know?! I doubt I'll be back, which is a bummer because we need more decent restaurants in mountains edge...... oh well"}
{"text":"Loving this new refreshing Mediterranean place. Food is fresh. People behind counter always friendly."}
{"text":"Read an recent review of this restaurant in the Henderson edition of the Review Journal a few weeks that sparked my interest in this hole-in-wall non hamburger establishment.  Wow why would anyone want to continue to eat the poor quality crap from the McD' of this world when they have the alternative fresh high quality ingredients served here. And may I add at a price that is equal or less then I expected.  Grab your tray and go down the counter as the server prepares your meal. Being my first time here I chose  to have the dressing and hummus as side portions, both were excellent. My order consisted of a brown rice bowl ....rather than white rice...and chopped white chicken. The portion size was more than adequate. If I was really smart I could have eaten half and taken home the remainder....maybe next time. Overall the quality..quantity..and price were 5 star . I'm deducting 1 star for the old condition of the furniture, fixtures and lack of a much needed fresh coat of paint. I highly recommend that you give them a try and use the $2.00 discount Yelp offer."}
{"text":"Everything was really fresh and tasty! I'm super happy that this place is so close and convenient although that means I'm going to be eating a lot of falafel :)"}
{"text":"Delicious Middle East flavors for those on a lunchtime budget. Owner and staff super friendly. Clean! Great experience"}
{"text":"My husband said it best, \"if Chipotle were literally next store, I would never go there, and I like Chipotle.\"  I've been on a hunt for great Arab food since we moved to Vegas 7 years ago. I've lived in Egypt, England, and Michigan (land of cheap and plentiful shwarama), and this is the first place that I've been to in the Valley that really gets it. The pick your wrap concept is so brilliantly suited to the kind of Arab comfort food that every college kid in England and Michigan is used to after a night of partying, but the level of choice also makes healthy and hearty completely plausible.  I had the falafel wrap and the falafel was obviously fresh, golden, and had a perfect marriage of crust and filling. I used to stop and pick up a dozen falafel on the way home from class in Egypt, and these would have fit right in. Sababa has been my go to falafel place, but these unseated them easily. The rest of the ingredients completed the taste bud experience: cucumber, tabouleh, red onions, ZiKiZ rice, hummus, black olives,  and feta ($.50 up charge).  My husband had the spinach and herb wrap filled with angus steak, ZiKiZ rice, hummus, onion and tabouleh and you already saw his verdict.  I had a side of tabouleh and it was so good I got another to go.  Now all I wish was that they had a branch in North LV."}
{"text":"Its been a while since I have been back to this side of town! great food! I'll be back for sure for some healthy food! :)"}
{"text":"The food was pretty decent, however the service was terrible when I went in. Also, I don't recommend paying $3.99 for the \"loaded garlic fries\" because you're literally only playing for a small amount of regular fries with \"garlic\" seasoning sprinkled on top. It was not worth it and very misleading."}
{"text":"I have been twice now and had an excellent experience both times. I prefer the bowl with spicy chicken.  I have also gone just for ingredients I couldn't find at the local grocery. The staff was happy to help and packed up everything I needed. I was thoroughly impressed with how nice they were! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place, I wasn't impressed the chicken was very dry and I just wasn't a fan. My co-worker decided to order this for the lunch the other day and I'm so glad I tried it a second try. The gyro plate was fantastic. Great sized portions and totally juicy. The hummus was so great! I am glad I gave this place another shot."}
{"text":"Three years later and this is still one of my favorite local restaurants! The food is extraordinary. The hummus is unequivocally THE best (trust me!). The zikiz dressing is wildly addicting. I want them to bottle it so I can eat it every day LOL. Travis is the friendliest and so sweet to our two year old who adores him, and visiting zikiz is like going to see an old friend when he's around! Make sure to sign up for their point rewards system for free meals, and don't forget to use your yelp check in offer."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of zikiz since they first opened in Henderson. Their new location is clean, large and comfortable, but quite a bit of a hike for us. Their hummus is absolutely amazing, but since changing distributors for their pita, which is now a cardboard-like consistency, I don't enjoy it nearly as much. The chicken has always been good but now that they're preparing it when ordered and it's not sitting, it's a thousand times better. We will come every now and then to feed our Zikiz cravings but given how far it is now I think our visits will be few and far between.   I urge you to bring back the old pita and get rid of the new trash."}
{"text":"We wondered in after having searched Yelp for vegan options.  We were delighted with our options.  The ingredient seemed especially fresh and delicious.  The staff were friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Have had their food many times for work functions. The wraps are bland and steak and chicken inside is dry and unseasoned. This time I skipped the wrap and just had salad, hummus and pita bread. It made myself and at least another co worker that I know of sick, she skipped the wrap as well.  I think I'll skip eating here all together next time. Not worth eating if I get sick or not."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and decided to go. Maybe this was an off day for this place. Apparently, the hummus is sought after? Unfortunately, there is no way that the hummus I tried there today could be sought after. I am very fortunate to have visited the middle east and tasted some of the best hummus ever, as well as having lived in New York City and in Montreal, Canada, where you have some of the best Lebanese food around and the hummus is amazing at many places. The falafel here was just OK. I ended up ordering the bowl with Hummus as the base and falafel as the protein. You get to choose what kind of ingredients you want to put on top of your base and there are many to choose from at a bar behind the counter, from many different types of chopped vegetables to chick peas to tabbouli salad to cheese to salad dressings, etc. I think that if I chose the rice as a base and chicken as a protein, I would have likely been happier. The bowl cost $10, which I thought was a little bit pricey for what I got. I am very disappointed in the service because I was not asked whether I wanted pita or not and they put a heap of hummus in the bowl with no bread or pita to go with it. Not sure if I will go here again. Was not impressed."}
{"text":"Mountains Edge has had next to nothing when it came to quality, real food. Finally. FINALLY. Real food. Gyros are delicious. Love the Zikiz fries... Solid."}
{"text":"My reasons for this rating relate to the quality of food, clean eats options, and all-around awesome service every time we've been here!  Since being pregnant, I sometimes don't want meat - like, at all. So, I discovered Zikiz on the way to an appointment and fell in love with their falafel!   I explain to people that Zikiz is like Chipolte or Qdoba but with a Mediterranean vibe! You can choose from different greens, rice that's homemade, sauces that are homemade, and lots of fresh veggies and toppings to make a bowl or wrap of your choice!  Eddie is the owner there and very nice! He remembers who we are and makes my bowl just perfectly - even if I want to be weird and have hummus and pickles together lol.  Looking at other reviews, there could be 'more' to this place, but there's already so much to choose from in Henderson and Vegas -- if you want simple and clean food that's good and good for you, this is the place to try!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on yelp and figured I would try it out. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! Manger welcomed me at the door, very very nice guy!!! The staff was really nice as we'll. The food was fresh steak is cooked perfectly. I got the spinach wrap with steak, humus, lettuce, onion with homemade rice and sauce. I can tell it's going to my new favorite place to grab a bite to eat.  With the fresh food great staff I will be back.  Hope the best for this restaurant! KCCO!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and very friendly staff, it was my first time there so they explained the concept clearly and suggested some delicious sauces. They were right! The gyro meat was tasty and the sauce superb! We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Owners are very attentive and proud of their place \"best hummus in vegas or I'll buy it back from you\" was one quote.  I'm no expert at Mediterranean/middle eastern good but I'll say this you probably can't go wrong with this place fresh delicious clean and generous portions  It's set up like a chipotles where you add ingredients as you go down the counter which usually makes me think the food can't be as fresh and delish as made to order but it was really really good."}
{"text":"Yay one Zikiz closer to home! Now if they can open one in Summerlin... Just as the Zikiz in Green Valley: fresh food, nice portions, great prices, with a twist; there's a coffee shop attached, so after healthy and green food you can have a delicious dessert and a cup of Joe."}
{"text":"First time here! Great food. Plenty of vegetarian/vegan options! staff is super nice."}
{"text":"This place has become a habit. It's pretty amazing. That's all there really is to it, especially if you like wraps and fast-ish food that isn't ungodly unhealthy for you.. and let's face is, most of it is.   Food: YAY! Just yay! Everything I've tried here so far is great. They have 4 wraps that you can choose from, which are regular, whole wheat, Spinach and Herb, and Sundried Tomato. Whole wheat is usually my weapon of choice, but I've had the sundried tomato one as well and it was a-okay in my book. Oh, one more thing! They also have a gluten free wrap, so if you or somebody you know is gluten-free this place is fine. If you don't feel like a wrap, they have a variety of other options, such as bowls, plates, and salads...but really, wraps are just amazing and you should feel bad if you don't want to try one. Next is the meat. Omnomnom, meat. You can get chicken, steak, vegetarian fafalal, or crab (which of course costs extra.) I've had the chicken and steak. Both of them are good, but I prefer the chicken just because it's the healthier option and I'm pretty sure I could never get sick of chicken. Ever. The toppings are plentiful and I won't name all of them off, but the bonus here is that you can get hummus as a topping. YAY! They also have feta cheese. DOUBLE YAY!   Sauces: Yes, this gets its own category because their sauces are awesome as well. They have some crazy ones, such as Mango Curry, and Citrus, but all of the basics are there too. Ranch, Chipotle, Buffalo, etc. They have a special Zikiz's sauce, but don't worry, it's basically a posh oil blend. Once again, all of the sauces I've had were good. The Mango Curry is my favorite, by far, since it's sweet, but has a little tang to it as well. It's perfect for a chicken and hummus wrap.   Customer Service: I've been there a few times now and every time I go, the people working are extremely friendly. You are greeted and helped right away. The people are knowledgeable about the work environment and are readily available to hear you out for all of your Zikiz needs. In fact, if it's your first time, they are more then willing to explain the process of wrap making for you. The last time I was there, I had to get a gluten-free wrap for my friend, but didn't know what she wanted on it. She was at home sick, so I called her and asked. We were luckily the only ones in the store at the time, but when all was said and done, they ended up making her another wrap because the gluten-free ones tend to get hard after awhile. This impressed me, even though it was my fault it took so long. They were also patient.   So this place is amazing and it's definitely on my must eat at when I'm feeling lazy but fairly healthy at the time days. One of the reviews said it best. It's like Chipotle, but 10x healthier. They also sell humus and an assortment of gluten free items in a freezer they have there. Worth a gander if you are ever in the area. The only downside is that it's tucked away in a corner of the Smiths shopping center, so it doesn't stand out. Fear not, because it will after you eat there!"}
{"text":"Everyone was very nice a and the food was fresh and so yummy! So excited to see something new in Mountians edge!"}
{"text":"Now first let me be honest, I didn't come to the restaurant to eat. I was hired by a company to take a few photos of their food.  I arrived early and watched the the staff interact with customers. It was great to see interactions other then.. \"What do you want!\"  The staff even joked around with a regular referring to him by name and inquiring about his life. This was kinda of a cool place to be.  The staff was no different with me, very helpful and very friendly. At the end of my shoot they offered me some food. I didn't want to be rude, and it did look very good, so I tried a Hummus Plate.  OMG! This was the best Hummus I have ever had. It was a mellow yet flavorful mix with a little Tabouli and cucumber. It came with Falafel that was also amazing. I was sad to see the empty bowl when I was done.  I was wondering if it would look bad if I licked the bowl clean... I decided against this as the restaurant was pretty full.   Such a great place, I am glad work brought me here.. Yet their food and interactions will bring me back."}
{"text":"The chipotle of Mexican food and thank goodness something new opened close to Mountains edge!   I am currently dairy free so eating out can be challenging at times but with diy places I cannot go wrong.  This is a diy Greek place that offers wraps, bowls, salads, etc. The gyro meat was tasty and everything was very fresh! They gave me a good sized portion of meat and all the veggies I wanted.   We did not dine in but my husband was in and out quickly and back home in twenty minutes so it is very convenient for anyone needing a quick bite in the mountain's edge area!"}
{"text":"Love Zikiz, great tasty food, my favorite is falafel, ingredients are always fresh and very tasty. The owner is very friendly and cares for his customers.."}
{"text":"Wowwww this place is a little gem! Food is so fresh and flavorful! They cooked the salmon right in front of me and were super fast! Had the brown rice salmon bowl with hummus peppers onions tomatoes olives tabouli chickpeas and feta.... For $10"}
{"text":"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner this is a Fantastic place for delicious healthy wraps and bowls. Staff is awesome every time we've stopped in. Great rewards program also . Best shop in the Mts.Edge area. Thanks again Eddie!!!"}
{"text":"I Love this place!!! Pita bread with brown rice and fresh veggies for under $10.  Plus I got coconut water.  It is Super Tasty and the dressing was with garlic and spices. It's Zikiz sauce.  It's a great place for us Vegans!!! (They had plenty of choices for non vegans too same prices, too)."}
{"text":"Portion of food are small for the price, will not eat here again. Bowl cost $8.50 and the meat is like a spoon full only, way too frugal. You can see how they add ingredients way too small"}
{"text":"The Greek and Mediterranean delicacies at this new little dining joint right outside Mountain's Edge are quite tasty. We ordered a steak wrap, hummus, pita, steak bowl and chicken finger combos for the kids. Just perfect for our to go meal for the evening. Knowledgeable and very welcoming staff. If you're in the area and hungry, give it a try!"}
{"text":"There are so many amazing flavors , all made at the store! Love the chipotle and Zikiz dressing! This food is so tasty and fresh  that I have to come once a week with my husband! The best part is that it can be guilt free if you are watching too!"}
{"text":"They just added sweet potato fries to the menu!!!  They are delicious!  Had my usual zikiz rice bowl.  Pretty much always fantastic."}
{"text":"For my first visit here, I tried the new blackened salmon and the new Mahi Mahi wraps. Choosing the best fillings & dressing is key, and I did a much better job with the salmon (cukes, tomato, garbanzo, tabbouleh) than the Mahi (tomato, banana peppers, red onion, tabbouleh). Trial and error, my friend. The fish was good and I like that they added these choices to the menu. Wraps are a bit pricey at $7-8, but it's all fresh, so there you go!"}
{"text":"This place just opened up near my home and I couldn't be happier. They serve fresh wraps with customizable ingredients, salads, bowls, and even gyros which aren't listed on the menu. So far I have only tried the chicken wrap on whole wheat but it was delicious. I was going to eat half and save half for later (because it was a large wrap) but it was so good I ate the whole thing in one sitting! The service was a bit slow but they had a sign up saying they are training the new employees so we weren't surprised. If you're impatient or in a hurry, try this place in a week or two when they get it nailed down :)  You can add rice, hummus, all kinds of veggies, and any sauce you like to your wrap. I had the zikiz rice which sort of reminded me of rice-a-roni with those thin little pasta bits in it, and it was great. Their tzatziki sauce added great flavor to the wrap too. My fianc√© got a salmon wrap with chipotle sauce which he said was not spicy (we were told it was) but had good flavor overall and he loved the salmon.  Thanks ZiKiZ!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is about for this place. I though it was good but not awesome. I can here for lunch w/ fellow Yelper Christie L. This was a first visit for the both of us.  When we walked in we were greeted promptly and since we were looking at the menu the gentleman behind the counter asked if it was our first visit. He went over the menu and told us how it all worked. The process is similar to Chipotle in that you say you'd like a burrito, bowl, salad etc. and then you choose your toppings.  I ordered the ZiKiZ's bowl which included ZiKiZ's rice, a combination of rice and thin pasta. From there you choose a meat, I choose steak. Then I choose my toppings, hummus, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, feta cheese, yellow peppers & ZiKiZ's sauce. The food was fresh and I felt it could've used a bit more flavor.  There was a bit of confusion at the cash register. We had a coupon for $5 off a $20 purchase. I felt that the gentleman ringing us up just wanted to get our total over $20 vs thinking that we may each want a drink. We needed to add at least one combo to get over $20. I'm not sure exactly what was rung up but it was assumed that we would want French fries & not another side & only one drink.  I'm glad that a restaurant has lasted this long in this spot, but ZiKiZ's is not on my high priority list of place to return."}
{"text":"Im trying this place for the first time and i ordered the caramel frappe - Soooo good!!! Ill have to make this place my morning coffee stop in the morning !!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time about two months ago. Liked it and was happy for something new in the area. Went back a second time and felt a little grossed out. One of the workers had gloves on and was holding the ipad/register, and then with the same gloved hands, he flattened the rice in my wrap and continued touching all of the fresh food. Also touched his hair at one point. Haven't been back."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing steak wrap... Big portions fresh veggies and sauce is to die for.."}
{"text":"Amazing food, simple menu, at an affordable price. I highly suggest you try the falafel!"}
{"text":"I was craving a good greek salad for lunch and didn't want to go to Panera (again). Came across ZiKiZ on Yelp; it was a bit out of the way for me, but I decided to give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did! The place is clean, staff is friendly, food is served quickly, and the menu is full of great options.  I got a salad with chicken (fresh off the grill) and my choice of other toppings (chick peas, banana peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta), which were all fresh and tasty. The ZiKiZ vinaigrette dressing was amazing. I also got a side of pita and hummus - pita was yummy, hummus was good - next time, I'll see if I can get a side of Tzatziki sauce instead.  I've now been there twice, and although I've gotten the same thing both times, I haven't been disappointed. Next time, I'll try a gyro.  I wish there was another location closer to my work and/or home! I hope this place is and continues to be successful. I'll definitely be back!"}

{"text":"Came back here a couple more times, and I'm sad to say I won't be able to update this to a 5-star review.  One of the employees (I *think* this might be the owner's son, but this is a pure guess so I have no idea) is pretty unfriendly. Not rude, but just not friendly. Also finally had something other than the falafel - the chicken - and found it to be pretty dry.   Still going to be coming back here again and again, but definitely has room for improvement."}
{"text":"The gyro is the winning entree there. It's deliciously tender with flavorful seasoning along with it. I can't complain; it's just that yummy. My girlfriend and I often get it as a salad and pita which never fails to deliver in flavor. Their portions are also favorable making you wonder if whatever you're eating there is indeed healthy, because it's questionably delicious. Also, when they give you hummus, they incredibly generous about it.   The only thing I didn't really like was that the process is a bit slow. Despite being the second person in line, the wait is inappropriate. I think it's because they shave the gyro then grill it. I wonder how long I would have to wait if there was actually a long line. Pretty sure it would be unpleasant.   Also, customer service could improve. Every time I visit, the associates don't seem to like being there. It's almost a tad bit intimidating to grab business there, but again, the food is good so I can't exactly complain about it.   I hope they continue to grow in efficientcy, customer service, and for traffic, because I definitely want to see more of them around Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here because my husband wanted to try this place. It's super clean on the inside and had a casual ambience. It kind of reminded me if a Chipotle or cafe Rio because the menu is above the bar where you can watch them make your food. We chose a combo bowl with gyro meat, cucumbers, and a few other vegetables. We also choose mango curry sauce. The food was pretty good and the service was good. I plan on coming here to try their other food on the menu."}
