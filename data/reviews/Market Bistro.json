{"text":"This is an amazing place!!!!  As far as bistro's go this place tops any one that I have been to in Phoenix.  Everything they serve is absolutely amazing.  The cuban pork is my favorite, you can add it to a salad which I think is best, get it by itself or even get it in a sandwich!!  The salad bar has like 40 different things to choose from in your salad which is always a big plus to have.  I would reccomend this place to just about anyone, as long as you are in the mood for a delicious sandwich, pizza or an awesome salad!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. I used to drive to Moon Valley to enjoy their cuisine. Now it is less than a mile away.Everything I have ever had (10 visits or more) has been perfect. I only wish they would  improve their kids menu. They have the ingredients already on hand to achieve this. My kids would go nuts for a broiled PB, honey and sunflower seed sandwich, or a bacon, apple and cheese melt. My husband and I can only go when our monsters are at school, because they know the menu isn't geared for them. 
Please try this great place no matter what.- it is a winner."}
{"text":"If you like \"make your own\" salads with a huge variety of fresh toss-ins and flavorful dressings, then Market Bistro is your place. The salads ($7.99) can get a wee bit pricey when you start adding in proteins ($2.29), but they're very big...enough for your entire meal, or even to share as a light meal. I've also tasted their tortilla soup, and it's wonderful, and I know others who enjoy their sandwiches."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is one of my all time favs for lunch or place for meetings close to my office! The food is great tasting, very fresh and they have a lot of options for creating your own salad! The interior decor of the restaurant is very simple and modern. I am getting hungry just thinking about them!"}
{"text":"Stars are for the food! It gets a bit backed up during the lunch rush and I could see how it would effect someones rating. I can also see how people would either love this place or not like it at all because it is a bit unique from the ordering to the menu. 

I ordered the 1/2 Turkey BLT with the Chicken Tortilla Soup. I love this sandwich! The bread is great and a bit different which I like because it's a little chewey but you don't break your teeth on it like some \"bistro\" breads. The grilled sliced turkey has a nice seasoning on it and they are pretty generous with the portions. I think this sandwich ties together so nice because of the smoked paprika mayo and the roasted tomatoes... Oh yeah, the bacon isn't bad either. The soup at first seemed store bought but after further consideration I don't think it is. I am a big fan of soup and this was pretty decent. They also have corn chowder and garlic tomato and a \"build your own salad bar\" that has almost everything you can think of to put on a salad. Oh yeah, Pizza too! I haven't tried the Pizza yet but plan on it one of these days. 

Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in the area!"}
{"text":"Three of us tried this place for the first time last night, a Tuesday night.  We split a sausage pizza ($12.99) described on the menu as italian sausage, roasted fennel, carmelized onion and roasted red peppers.  Two of us liked the pizza and one of us thought is was just OK.  Two of us thought it had way too much fennel.  Unless you want fennel to dominate the taste of the pizza ask them to cut back on it.  I thought the pizza crust tasted too sweet.  I don't put sugar in my pizza crust.  I would call this thin crust pizza with lots of toppings, making it medium thick and somewhat soggy, not as crisp as I would like.

The citrus basil salad ($6.99) was just the right size for 3 to split with a pizza.  Two of us liked the salad a lot, but one thought the dressing was a little tart from the citrus,  but refreshing.  The greens were fresh and nice.  We all loved the candied walnuts, which there were plenty of.

Two of us shared a small bottle of merlot wine ($14).   It poured two glasses of medium quality wine.  It was just OK.  For $7 a glass I was thought it should have been better.

The young staff was friendly and helpful in taking your order and money.  Although I thought the two big pierced lip rings the register guy had were gross.  What a turn off.   They should put him in the back where the public doesn't have to look at him.  

The process here is; stand in line, order your food, order drinks at the register, and then you carry your drinks, plates, glasses, and salad to the table.  Then you go get your water, napkins, and tableware yourself.  This means you might save a couple of bucks on a reduced, or no tip, depending on how you think this system is suppose to be compensated.

The furnishing were basic but pleasant.  Tables were spaced well apart so you don't feel crowded.  The background music was pleasant and not too loud.  It wasn't noisy liked some places.  But it wasn't real busy either.

Overall two of us liked the place and wanted to go back.  The third person, me, thought it was just OK, and I would go back if the others wanted to since it's close by.  But I'm always on the look out for great pizza, and this was just OK pizza.

The total bill for three of us, with two drinking wine, and one drinking water, was $36.80, before tip.  And you may not need to tip due to the self serve style."}
{"text":"Arizona salad rocks.  Tangy, spicy, sweet, and usually fresh.  They lost a star when my last salad tasted spoiled.  A prior take-out salad had the dressing AWOL.  The grilled meats and pizza are blasse.  I go back, but wish they would expand the menu."}
{"text":"Great sandwich, sliced thick turkey on turkey blt!  Also, saw steak salad that looked amazing...will try it next time."}
{"text":"This is where you go to get a very good salad.  I don't think there pizza or sandwiches are as good.  But the create your own salad is wonderful.  It takes a few times, but when you get the right combo of ingredients it is really good.  Try the whipped balsamic dressing, candied walnuts, and parmesan crisps.  Side note-the lemon cookie is so good, don't try it unless you want to crave it."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is one of my favorite places! Not just in Phoenix, but anywhere. I had to move to CA but whenever I come back to Phoenix I make a point to come to Market Bistro (usually it's the first thing I do!). Their turkey BLT is my favorite thing on the menu, it is absolutely delicious. The paprika mayonnaise is what does it for me! 
The restaurant itself is nice, good atmosphere and the service has always been good.
I love this place for the turkey BLT alone and I miss it a lot!"}
{"text":"It might have been that I was just hopped up on cold meds, but when I walked in I wasn't sure where I was supposed to start as the primary \"Order Here\" sign was askew and I missed it--and with no one in line I was momentarily unsure of where to begin my Market Bistro experience.  As my architect friend would say, they need to work on their \"welcoming sequence\".

Once I overcame this small issue I asked about soups of the day (didn't seem to be posted anywhere...nor was the menu but I could of missed it) and none sounded too exciting so I went with the Arizona tri-tip sandwhich.  Once I had sandwhich in hand I proceeded to the cash register which appeared to be the next logical step...but it was unattended.  I suppressed my kleptomatic urge to run with sandwhich in hand, and actually had to track someone down to complete my purchase.  No tip for you!

The sandwhich itself was actually pretty good, ciabatta bread, some roasted chilis, not too shabby.  However, if this place struggles with no one in line, 5 employees, and an empty house I would hate to try it on a busy day!  I will say for the same price of a foot long at Subway you can get a quality sandwhich here if you're in the area--just don't expect the slick efficiency of a trained sandwich artist."}
{"text":"I first stumbled upon the original Market Bistro on Thunderbird a couple of years ago, I liked it, and tried to stop by when I was in the area.  I was excited to see a location move to Scottsdale, and I have been there a couple of times now.

First of all, I am not a salad kind of girl, but they do have a huge variety of salad toppings and I think this place would be a salad lovers dream!  I have had the soup (tortilla...very tasty), sandwiches and pizza all which pretty good.  I like that the sandwiches don't use processed lunch meat, but rather they carve the meat right there and then heat it up on the grill!  The California turkey is yummy, I really like the kick of the spicy mayo, and the bread is always very fresh!  On my last trip I had the Sonoma Chicken Pizza; chicken, pesto, cheese....it was good, I really liked the crust, but I just did not dig the tomato sauce that they used....too many herbs!  I think this would have been really good had the tomato sauce been better.

So why you ask am I liking the food and only giving them 3 stars?  Well, I think it is a bit on the pricey side....I paid $16 for my pizza and a soda!  I can get the same thing at CPK for cheaper!  I like the casualness of the place, and the food is good, but I think it is way too pricey for a fast-casual concept."}
{"text":"Best salads in town, you create you own so if it sucks you suck.  I go there 2-3 times a week for lunch."}
{"text":"My mom & I stopped in here for lunch Saturday afternoon. This place kind of reminded me of Chipotle, very industrial looking. After scanning the menus posted on the wall, she went for the balsamic portabella sandwich & I got the special which was a slice of pizza (I went with pepperoni) & a side salad. My mom loved her sandwich & my salad/pizza combo was delish, I also loved their berry green tea. Total for our meals plus drinks was about $20, not bad. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had heard some things about the new Market Bistro in the shopping center at Greenway and 64th.  I have been looking for a good, quick, sandwich spot that I could go to and Market Bistro is just that.  Its a good concept, basically DISH, without everything.  Its just sandwiches, soups, salads, and drinks.  I happened to be in the mood for a sandwich the day i went in.  I ordered the California Turkey not knowing what to expect.  It had all sorts of incredients.  Fresh grilled carved turkey, avacado mayo, swiss cheese, oven roasted tomato, tossed with romaine in oregano vinaigrette served on sourdough.  Sounds tasty right??  It was!  However, I took my sandwich to go and by the time i got back the bread was a little to mushy for me.  I like biting into a nice pieace of bread when I eat a sandwich.  Imagine that...bread...sandwich...who would have thunk that.  But all the ingredients in the sandwich were very tasty.  So I think Im gonna give this place a second go.  Maybe ill try the soup or salad next time or just tell them to go light on the dressing on the sandwich.  All the incredients look fresh and everything is prepared in front of you.  So if you need a quick sandwich, soup or salad....Market Bistro may be the place for you."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying I love MB...however, this is not a place you want to overindulge yourself in. While the place truly is phenomenal for what it offers, too much too soon and you won't think so highly of it. Then again, this can be said for many places.

Process:

MB has a nice setup as far as ordering/paying is concerned, and you can see everything they are doing (i.e. they aren't spitting in your food!) while you make your way down the line. I will say, however, the communication could be stepped up a notch between the patron and the person making the food. And you're not always acknowledged in a timely fashion--even if you make eye contact. This is not always the case, but i definitely see a trend..

Atmosphere:

I think they have the right idea, but i must admit, when you come in during a busy lunch rush, it's very difficult to maneuver between the tables. I'm not a large person by any means, but not a small on either. It becomes uncomfortable when having to interrupt someone else's lunch/conversation to squeeze by--all while trying not to spill your food/drink....either on yourself or the passerby.

Food:

The food is by far the star of this establishment, and rightfully so. The ingredients are fresh and vibrant and the combination of flavors just seem to work! I've tried all of their salads and love them, and my favorite sammy is the California Turkey. When i first read the description, i didn't know how i felt about it, but trust me when i say...do yourself a favor and order this! It's wonderful.  Have a napkin nearby, though. Their sandwiches are large, topped with generous fillings, and can get a little messy sometimes. Ok--go ahead and make that two napkins to be safe :)

All in all this is a great little place, especially for the surrounding area. It's the perfect combination of upscale meets casual. Bistro is just right. 

Keep doing what you're doing MB!"}
{"text":"I enjoy lunch here after church. The food is good and the atmosphere is comfortable and easy. Today it was a good place to catch up with an old friend."}
{"text":"Arizona Salad.  Extra black beans.  For.The.Win.

Fast service, nice location, friendly people!"}
{"text":"Hey, I stayed in Phoenix twice in the last 3 months and ate here everyday for lunch. Never, ever got tired of the offerings and had something different every time I came in. The salads are wonderful, and you can completely customize your own tossed salad. Totally fresh and delicious. I had several sandwiches and loved them all. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tortilla Soup...yum!

I ate at a place similar to this in San Francisco in a tiny little shop over 15 years ago and have wondered why somebody hasn't done a restaurant like this nationwide. I love it!"}
{"text":"I love everything at Market bistro, but I especially love the salads.  I always get the create your own with their homemade and delicious buttermilk Caesar dressing on the side.  That dressing is totally addictive!  The other thing I would wholeheartedly recommend is the Market pizza with goat cheese, artichoke hearts, oven roasted tomato, baby spinach, mozzarella, parmesan and basil pesto sauce.  It is probably my favorite vegetarian pizza.  You can get it by the slice at lunch, but have to order a whole pizza for dinner.

I've had the corn chowder with poblano chiles soup and it was great.  I've not tried the roasted garlic tomato soup but my friend loves it.  Had a sandwich here once, with tri-tip with caramelized onions, but it doesn't seem to match the description of the ones currently on the menu.  The only thing I haven't loved so far is their Margherita pizza.

Everyone here is always nice and friendly.  I love that it's family-owned and still doing well enough to open another location.  They now have online ordering, which I can't wait to try!"}
{"text":"Fellow yelpers, I was mislead by the reviews of this place! I frequently browze yelp to find new places to eat and must respectfully disagree with most of the reviews.

First off, it was so hot in this place; I don't think they had the air on. It also smelled like maybe their grease trap needed emptied-- not pleasant.

For a quick service setting, it was not quick at all. We waited 10 minutes to order on the counter, and then waited another 20 for it to be brought to our table. I had the tomato soup, which actually tasted pretty good but was still cold. I also had the California Turkey sandwich was a little too bready  for my taste, but otherwise okay.

The boyfriend had the marketplace turkey, which is served open-faced. He seemed to like his well enough.

This may have just been a bad visit, but I have no desire to come here again."}
{"text":"Casual, clean location 
Friendly, efficient staff
Fresh, flavorful food made to your order
What's not to like???

Great place for lunch or dinner whether you eat in or take out!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite new lunch stop.  The setup takes a minute to figure out, but you can order a salad or pizza just the way you like it.  I'm picky so that's a great feature.  You can see what they have and how everything is prepared in the open kitchen.  The salads are Great!"}
{"text":"Too bad that management doesn't know that the high school employees are running this place into the ground while they play on their i-phones and provide second rate customer service. My wife and I love the food especially the sandwiches but don't go simply because of the lousy service.
Sincerely,
local resident"}
{"text":"Went here this weekend with the girlfriend.  Best choice on eats I've made in awhile!

First off, the location itself.  There is a patio facing east.  If you get there at the right time, you can enjoy a beautiful evening with your awesome food.  The inside is very cozy with a great, open floor plan.  You can see all of the friendly staff preparing your meal behind glass near the front.  I wasn't sure what to order so the manager, Ben, gave me a few of his recommendations.  After an awesome conversation, I decided on the Turkey BLT (Grilled carved turkey, smoked paprika mayo, applewood bacon, oven roasted tomatoes with romaine on sourdough) with a Citrus Basil Salad (Spring mix, citrus wedges, cucumber, fennel, caramelized walnuts with citrus basi vinaigrette).

I watched them preparing a salad while I placed my order.  The girl behind the counter had just finished grilling a delicious piece of tri-tip steak.  She chopped it up and paced atop the salad.  I know what I'll be getting with my meal next time I'm here.  Looked delicious!

The food came and the line began to grow.  I arrived at the perfect time to beat the lunch rush.  My stomach was growling and it was on!  The sandwich looked like something out of a photo shoot.  Everything about it looked perfect.  The right portions of grilled turkey breast, crisp, green romaine that hung perfectly out the edges of the bread.  Speaking of the bread, it was incredibly fresh and flavorful.  One bite and I knew I was in love.  The girlfriend and I were blown away by the quality of the turkey breast.  It was grilled perfectly and had the perfect consistency.  The greens gave a great, refreshing taste to accent the turkey.  The smoked paprika mayo danced on my tongue and was the perfect amount.  The bacon was crisp and neither too thick nor too thin.  It added the perfect amount of smokiness to chase the flavor of the sandwich.

My girlfriend loved the salad.  I had several bites and will agree with many before me that have said Market Bistro has the freshest most flavorful greens around.  I felt exponentially healthier just looking at the beauty of it.  The caramelized walnuts added the perfect counter sweetness to the citrus of the dressing and fruits.

Do I recommend Market Bistro?  Absolutely!  If you enjoy Paradise Bakery you will fall in love with Market Bistro.  It's the equivalent of Paradise perfected.  Kudo's to my new favorite salad and sandwich place.  

Also worth mentioning is their awesome selection of music (they have their own station on Pandora!).  You'll feel like kicking your feet up on the couch near the front and relaxing after your stomach is full!"}
{"text":"Market bistro is basically Sauce with better sandwiches and worse pizza. But I like the location and the shorter lines, if that really matters."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last Sunday night.  Not too busy. My daughter is vegan and enjoyed potebello mushroom sandwich.  My wife and I shared a margarita pizza. It was very good. However back east this type of pizza has no red sauce so we were a little confused.  Nice place."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is a great place for lunch.  The have a \"create your own\" salad that is like a salad bar except with really fresh and  unique ingredients.  You choose up to 7 and they tooss it for you. Try the house Balsamic... is os fantastic.   You can top you salad with pesto chicken, marinated tri-tip etc.   If salad is not you thing they make excellent sandwiches and pizzas to order.  You can sit inside or outside.

The only downside is that it can get busy at lunch time but just get there a little early!"}
{"text":"Severely disappointed.  Tried it twice since I  had to use up gift certificates..  Will NEVER go back again after the 2nd salad had long black hair in it even though I still have.gift certificates.  You couldn't GIVE it to me free!  Hope your visit is better.  There wasn't a negative or no star allowed."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner last night based on the menu I found on the web.  I was very attracted to the healthy options listed.  Unfortunately, I passed over the salads and ordered the Number Two pizza.  It wasn't bad.  It also wasn't particularly memorable.  I suppose I'd try it again, in a pinch.

What will keep me away from this location is the staff.  I'd sure hate to see them during a lunch rush hour.  When I visited, there were only two customers in line and they seemed dazed and confused.  I stood at the counter for about five minutes (directly in front of two staffers) without being acknowledged.  Finally, one looks at me as to ask what I was doing there.  I don't believe he ever asked if he could help but I gave him my order, nonetheless.  There was a repeat scenario once I reached the cashier.  While waiting for my pizza to bake, another employee comes over to apologize about the wait on my tortilla soup.  I didn't order any soup.  Let me repeat that there were only two other customers in line during my visit.  The staff was unenthusiastic and seriously lacked customer service.  Everyone is entitled to an off day but this was ridiculous. 

I won't reurn."}
{"text":"The Arizona Tri-Tip Sandwich, and the Sausage Pizza, were quite good.  However, I used their online ordering which promised the food would be ready when I arrived.  Actually, they were unaware of the order when I arrived.  My daughter and I sat around for 25 minutes while they cooked the order.  They were apologetic, but did not offer anything in compensation, not even a soda while we waited."}
{"text":"This place is totally amazing!
Came for lunch with some coworkers for my first time and was blown away. The moment I walked in I was overwhelmed with the most delish smells that filled the restaurant. I was also pretty happy because even thought it was the lunch hour, the place wasn't packed or too busy. Loved the different choices available: pizza, salads, sandwhiches, or soups. After quite some time staring at my options, I decided on half pesto chicken sandwhich and the tortilla soup and an iced tea. 
I was surprised at how fast the food came out, yet how fresh and fabulous it was! The sandwhich was great, grilled pesto chicken on fresh ficotta bread. The soup was a tiny bit spicy and filled with pieces of chicken and veggies. I was blown away by the face that their iced tea is brewed from loose leaf teas...I am a little bit of a tea snob so this was a very nice surprise!!
My coworkers got salads which I was tempted by and a little bummed I didn't get one after I saw theirs. You have a choice of one of their salad concoctions or mixing up your own. The choices of salad mixings is awesome to say the least! Next time I will try one of those for sure!
I am very happy this place is close to work and will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying Market Bistro last week with the fabulous Gabi K. Perhaps it was the company that drove the experience up to 4 stars for me. 

I had the California Turkey sandwich, which included avocado. While I like avocado, I was hesitant, as my experience with similar sandwiches is HUGE, THICK slices, which I don't like. I was happy to see that they had a sort of \"thin crushed\" avocado layer, which was delish. The sandwich also had a vinaigrette dressing spread over it....not too soggy...just right and flavorful. 

While the sandwich was large and somewhat hard to control (I tried to take bites when Gabi wasn't looking, so she wouldn't see me spill it all over myself!), it was really delicious. 

This place packs a crowd, but the line moves fast and there was plenty of seating. The portions are enormous, so come hungry!"}
{"text":"Market Bistro has a great selection of fresh, tasty food! Very family-friendly, with \"kids eat free\" on Saturday and a lot of specials offered to VIP List (email sign-up on their website). I eat here 2 or 3 times each week and always leave happy! For take-out, the pick-up window is really convenient for grabbing lunch or when you have kids in the car and don't want to drag everyone inside. 

The #2 pizza, Market pizza and Sausage pizzas are all delicious! Be sure to save room for the chocolate chip & walnut cookie, it is heavenly!"}
{"text":"I like this little hole-the-wall place!  They make a made-to-order salad that rocks!  It is a wonderful place to stop for lunch.  

They also make pizza and sandwiches, which I have never tried.  

For the money, freshness, and quality of food this place can not be beat!"}
{"text":"I have long been a fan of the Market Bistro location on Thunderbird, so when I spotted the newer location on Greenway yesterday, I HAD to stop in for a bite.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that kid's meals are FREE on Saturdays!  And, mind you, this is no mickey-d's trans-fat-laden meal... my son had grilled pesto chicken, homemade mac&cheese and a big bowl of fruit salad (grapes, pears, strawberries and apples). Healthy, delicious and free... can't beat it! 

My meal was amazing.  I LOVE the pesto chicken sandwich, and should probably ask for an extra side of the corn mixture next time, because it is just so tasty.  My caesar salad had chives and sun-dried tomatoes, alonf with their delicious parmesan crisps and croutons.  The half-sandwich/salad meal was so large that I ended up taking half of the salad to go.  Two dinners for less than $10 - awesome! 

Even better than that? The service.  They must take pride in the employees that they hire, because all three girls that were working were incredibly helpful, and made the restaurant feel more full-service, than fast-casual.  Now, if only Market Bistro would open up a spot in Midtown, I'd be even happier.  Please?  Pretty please???"}
{"text":"Tweet tweet.  I decided to follow Market Bistro on Twitter just recently and am sure glad I did.  This company really knows how to treat their 'followers'. 

I have been a fan of Market Bistro for 2 years now, they have such a comfortable setting at both locations and the food is impeccable not to mention reasonably priced.

I have always opted for the Market pizza, a dish that includes artichokes, large sundried tomatoes and a flat parmesean encrusted dough.  There hasn't been one time that I've visited Market and felt disappointed in portion size or my order.  I have such an appreciation for an establishment that takes pride in their food's ingredients, atmosphere and customer service methods.

As for salads,  If you can take the 'heat' I would absolutely recommend the Arizona Salad.  The chipotle dressing, black beans, rice and tortilla crisps are a terrific blend of taste for your palette.  You will feel right at home here in the southwest with each and every bite.

If you haven't already started your car or phoned in your order at Market, I'm 100% sure you are crazy.

#BRAVO  (hashtagging seems appropriate here)."}
{"text":"The salads and pizza at Market Bistro are maybe some of the best I've ever had in Phoenix. Four years of coming here and I still have yet to run across something that's disappointed me. Anytime the temperature dips below 70 I start craving some vegetarian corn chowder.

Off the topic of food, but still worth noting is how cool the bathroom mirror is. If you stand just right you can get a perfect white ring just around your pupils.

My only complaint is that the lunch rush can get crowded and loud. There is usually always seating available at the bar or on the patio, though. And the staff (at both locations) has always been accommodating and friendly."}
{"text":"My first visit to Market Bistro was to have dinner with fellow Yelpers Nadia C and Deb L. It was recommended by Deb and it was a nice surprise to find out about a cool eatery not too far from my home. It was a casual atmosphere, which I enjoy, and the food options looked enticing.  I was really contemplating getting a pizza, but figure it would be too much for me to eat, so instead I ordered a sandwich, while Nadia and Deb opted for salads. 

The setup is a little confusing -- and that is mostly the reason I give it three stars -- as you have a couple stations where you can order your food: one for salad and one for the grill. But, if you can read, you can pretty much figure it out.  But, then after you order, I wasn't quite sure what to do. Do I wait there, watching them prepare it, or do I go straight to the cashier? Confusing.  But, I just went with the flow and eventually figured it out. 

By second trip to Market Bistro was a little better -- I knew the drill, what to do, where to go, but it still was a bit awkward.  And, when I placed my pizza order, they just yelled it out to whoever was in charge of the pizza orders, and I had a feeling that my order might quite possibly get lost in translation. And, well, I was right.  After my parents and sister got their food, I sat at the table waiting and waiting.  After about ten minutes or so after seeing other people get their food after I had ordered mine, I went up to the cashier asking when my pizza would be ready.  And, of course, they forgot about it.  But, they put a rush on it, and I had it very shortly after that.  

The slice of pizza I got was okay -- nothing really special (I should have gotten two slices since one just wasn't enough for me). The sandwich I had the previous visit was much better.  It was very flavorful and the bread was delicious. And, I even tried a bit of Nadia's salad, and being that they are custom-made, it was as good as you could would want it to be. 

Even though I had an order mishap and the ordering setup is a little confusing, I will definitely give Market Bistro more tries.  It is a decently priced, good food, new hangout that I'll keep in my rotation."}
{"text":"Ok I am having a hard time with this one... I would give the salad bar 5 BIG stars but the pizza is not so good (2 stars) and the sandwiches are so  so (3 stars).  As funny as it sounds, they do have fabulous mac n cheese (4.5 stars).  Also a thumbs up to the soups (4 stars).  That is about  a 75% rating, I wish I could give 3.5 stars.  
I really do love the salad bar and I stop by when I am in the area for this alone.  The salads are not small and if you add meat it is definitely more than enough to make a meal."}
{"text":"For lunch, split a Cobb Salad and Turkey BLT. The sandwich was good. The salad was aiiiiiiiiight.

You know what really bugged me? Five kids standing around behind the counter and nine (count 'em, nine) uncleared tables. I wasn't there long (20-30 minutes), but nobody thought to clean up a little. Super messy and gross.

A shame, because the more I think about the sandwich, the more I think I liked it."}
{"text":"A great place to bring friends and family for hearty sandwiches, fresh designer salads (with you as the designer), and delectable pizzas. I love the clean, bright interior and the overall casual atmosphere. And for the quality of the food you get, the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Less than $10 for a huge sandwich and drink. The sandwiches are pretty big, one is really like the size of 2. 

I had the California Turkey and the turkey was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The grilled meat was warm, tender and moist. Loved the avocado mayo, vinaigrette and roasted tomatoes. One of my coworkers got the Cuban pork and that looked delicious as well. We both wanted to try each others sandwiches, but were too busy scarfing down our own to share. Think we'll split the two sandwiches next time so we can have both. 

The place was cute and clean inside. We got there before noon and although there were quite a few tables already taken up, there was no line to order. You order at the counter and then move along to pay at the cashier. You serve your own drink, but they come by your table to serve your meal. We waited about 5-10 minutes to get our food. They have quite a bit of seating inside at tables or at a bar type set up and also seating outside. 

I can't wait to come back. I'm already craving another sandwich from this place."}
{"text":"The food is good, atmosphere a little strange, and the prices a tad high for what you get.  Got a sandwich and a salad.  The sandwich was good, but it was just that, a sandwich.  No accessories.  The salad was also good, but it could have really used a meat on top.  You had the option, but the salad was already a bit pricey to begin with and adding meat would have made it over a $10 salad...for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service. The atmosphere is classy but comfortable. You could bring a formal business meeting here, or come in wearing your gym clothes and both would fit in."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is so cute, and the food is great. Today I had a pesto chicken sandwich and my friend had a grilled tri tip sandwich. Yum! The salads look incredible and are huge, so that's what I want to try next time. They also have cute little bottles of wine. The have various ice teas for anyone like me that loves tea. I tried the passion berry and the green tea since it's free refills. Love it!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with the other yelpers here...food is fresh; bread is amazing. I'm a fan of the Turkey BLT especially [sourdough bread, grilled carved turkey, applewood smoked bacon, romaine, roasted tomato and paprika mayo!]   The pesto pizza is also very fine. I didn't love the Caesar salad I've had but that was mostly because I found the dressing had too much garlic. Its all made to order and they do a fine job when I call ahead for a take out order; its ready when I get there or very shortly thereafter. 

The surroundings are nice and its especially nice to be able to sit outside on the nicer evenings. But here too, will share in the 'how about a clean table' complaint. I mean, I'm payin' 7 and a half bucks for a sandwich. A clean table should come with. All in all though still a reco for a really good lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have never been disappointed! The pizzas are delicious and are a great escape from your average 'cheese' pie. My usual order is the creat-your-own salad with chicken. They grill the chicken right in front of you and marinate it with pesto right on the grill . Great service and food; well worth the little extra it costs!"}
{"text":"Great place for salads and sandwiches and the generally \"healthy\" feel.  

I've had all the salads and a couple of the sandwiches... the only complaint I had was there were WAY too many chipotles in the Arizona Salad and it way overdid the taste of the salad (which was very good, btw)... but other than that, the place is an excellent \"green\" place."}
{"text":"I don't usually give out 2 stars. I mean, I love food and I like to think of myself as an amateur \"foodie\", but in the 3 times that I have been here I love the food, but am not diggin on the atmosphere and dirty and cramped tables. Plus, it was hot in there. I enjoyed my summer salad and slice of margarita pizza, but thought to myself as I left, \"I really wish that I liked this place more, I mean, I live close and drive by almost everyday\"....
Can anyone who owns this good food/poor atmosphere place get a consultant in there to take this place to the next level? Just a thought..."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update my previous review.  This time they gave me an actual glass for water!  Woo hoo!!  And the salad guy's arm is no longer in a cast!  Yay!!

Still, 'I'm just not that into' Market Bistro.  The ordering part is still slow with the custom salads.  I decided to try the California Turkey sandwich, and it failed to impress.  I liked the roasted turkey and other toppings, but it was served on big pieces of thin, floppy white bread that didn't do a very good job of holding in the ingredients.  Whenever I picked up the sandwich to take a bite, the turkey would fall out.  There was no graceful way of picking it up and eating it the normal way, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork.  Awkward."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner again, but this time I managed to try something new.  I started with my standard Caesar salad but this time it wasn't very good.  It was just 'eh and had way way way too many croutons.  That salad is very inconsistent here.

Then I went away from my norm and got the pork tenderloin instead of the steak.  It was very tender and juicy but the sauce they marinate it in is not very good.  It has a weird taste to it - kinda bitter kinda sweet.  I'm going to stick to the tri-tip next time as it has always been excellent.

For my sides I had the grilled veggies and mac n' cheese.  The veggies were just ok but the mac was not very good at all.  I'm not a huge fan of the sides here.  They taste and look exactly the way they would if I made them at home = amateur cooking and not restaurant caliber.

As always the service was very good."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the bistro. Today, however, a seemingly 'customer' was going behind the kitchen area, flipping my pizza and even entering the kitchen door. What? If you are an owner and are enjoying the bistro, act like a customer! I was kind of disturbed by a casual guy eating in the restaurant with his family and then going to get  cups, plates, and food from the serving area. Can I do that next time? I hope I go back. I have taken friends. As I said , I am a fan. You need my business."}
{"text":"Bistro.... Brasserie.... These are the type of places where we typically stay away from......... With 3 kids the eatery's we like are fast (not fast food fast), friendly, fresh, and good. This \"Bistro\" makes the mark. 

It is counter service, with a catch....they take the food to your table. Seriously, the guy that grilled our food was the same person who served our table. 

Wife was sold on the salad (Cobb with Tri-Tip). I had the tri-tip sandwich. The meat could have been sliced a bit thinner....tri tip is not the most tender meat. You know how it goes... bite the sandwich and a chunk of meat and dressing is hanging from your mouth and your trying to yank on it..... Don't get me wrong it was good, messy good. 

What won me are the kids meals. For under $5, our child's jr. meals included meat (choice of Chicken pesto, Tri, and Pork) and two sides. Kids loved the mac and cheese. The carrots were smothered in brown sugar or maple syrup...Also included their drink. 

One suggestion to improve this place would be for someone to take your order and give you a slip so when you get the the register, you know what your ordered. We have 5 in our family so getting everyones meals right was a chore. OK for my wife, not so much a chore. 

We including this in our family places to eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. Staff is always friendly. Food taste great. And to top it off.... they are supporters of the dining out for life. I say 5 stars!! Yum yum!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place for salad -- the \"Create Your Own,\" which I eat almost daily. Very friendly staff. Very fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing food. One of the Valley's best kept secrets. Seriously - I dine at the \"top\" places and the food here beats the heck out of fancy lunch anywhere. I suggest the custom salad - really fresh ingredients, and the California Turkey. The pizza is pretty darn good too!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. Not only do they use the freshest ingredients possible for those \"make your own salads,\" but the team that works there is usually really incredibly helpful and hard working. The California Turkey sandwich is incredible."}
{"text":"Alexander is right . This is a great place to control your choices. I love that you can  make your own salad up with lots of  fresh , healthy ingredients like dried tomatoes, cucumbers, olives etc.  

Market Bistro gives you the feeling of bringing healthy , fresh food to your family. That doesn't mean it actually is but it sure puts up a great face. 
for my friends the design your own salad is the hot attraction. But for other patrons I noticed the pizza seemed to be very popular. My daughter loves the cheese pizza as well. My Papa loves the tenderloin dinner and will almost always order that. 

The set up of the restaurant makes eating with family  or little ones pretty easy. You  order at the counter and bring your own food to the table. 
they also offer homemade looking cookies that I  have heard are good. 
Great place to grab a quick  bite  or take food to go."}
{"text":"I have driven by several times before I finally stopped in.

Admittedly, I was surprised by the menu, not sure why but I didn't expect to see this type of place in a strip mall?  Sorry.

The food and staff were great, I tried numerous sandwiches and salads now and depending on what you are looking for, its all good.  My only issue, no real kids menu, the pizza was a bit large for one kid, otherwise I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place always seems busy, which is awesome for them, but I'm not really sure why. The food is okay, granted I've only gotten a salad from them, but it wasn't anything special. The staff way friendly and the restaurant itself was clean. Its never my primary choice to go for grub, but I do have a few friends that enjoy this bistro. I think I just need to give it another try and order a sandwich or something, but for now it will stay with a 3 star rating. I don't have much to say except that their beer selection is rather nice for this type of cuisine."}
{"text":"Good lunch place.  The food is great, but the atmosphere is very casual and a little awkward.  The actual process of ordering is not very intuitive, and a bit haphazard.  While most of the staff appear to be high school and college students, everyone has always been helpful and friendly.  I have no problem recommending this place to my friends for lunch.  And, I am pretty sure this is a locally owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I ditch class more than I should probably admit on this public forum, and the last time I found myself walking away from my night class my best friend and I decided food was in order. 

My best friend, Samantha B., does not have a Yelp. She should. In fact, I would like to dedicate my current Elite status to her because she knows every great restaurant all over the city. I often accompany her to these food havens because I sugar momma her with rides to ASU West. 

Samantha B. introduced me to Market Bistro on the fateful day that we ditched night class, and I have been craving it ever since. We got a salad and Mac and Cheese. 

The create-your-own is fabulous; ten items for $7.99. Parmesan chips, grapes, mixed springs, corn (?!), walnuts, olives, and five other things I can't remember made up our salad which was big enough to split. I questioned her judgment on the corn. I really did. I now see the error in my ways. Of the dressing choices we got ranch. Now, I don't even like ranch. But guess what? You're going to like it! And I did too--on this salad anyways. 

The mac wasn't as good as the salad, but it was alright. I wish it was fresh and came in larger portions. 

Next time I ditch class, I know to go to Market and get corn in my salad. My cravings are telling me to ditch class soon."}
{"text":"I love this place and let me tell you why. Pure and simple I'm a control freak.. I like to control all aspects in my life and when I cant have my way I get a little wigged but quickly get over it. I mean we really all like to have control of our lives, well why not our food as well? 

This place is awesome for control freaks who don't want to be forced into a pre-determined salad.. you control every aspect.. your greens, toppings, dressings, vinegars, salt, pepper.. its so awesome! On top of the control issue I also like places that are locally owned and have the freshest ingredients.. Market Bistro fills both of those perfectly! MB also plays really cool downbeat music, thats awesome! On my last visit they were even playing Poor Leno by Röyksopp.. I thought I was the only one who listens to them! They also do that song for \"Its so easy a caveman can do it' commercials.

If you have control issues or not and want to control what you're eating, MP is the place for you!"}
{"text":"You know when you make a copy of the original and its not quite the same? Juts a little fuzzy around the edges, not as sharp but usable? That is how I felt at the new location of Market Bistro. Similar vibe that I enjoy at the original isn't quite as pulled together at this location. Maybe the lack of a lounging area or the weird particle board chic tables? Or the fact that every table was dirty except one by the blast furnace (front entrance).. maybe the grease dripping on the glass in front of the grill? No forks? I'm sorry if I sound like a banging on MB.. but these are things that can be improved on. 

The Mr and I shared a salad and a Cuban sandwich.. the control freak in me of course got off on the salad making.. this was probably the best salad Ive made to date.. you should be able to patent your creations! The Cuban sandwich was okay.. the ciabatta rolls are so thick and chewy that when you take a bite the toppings sort of fire out the back.. for a Cuban sandwich I think it had some sort of Asian spice, like cardemom?? Anyway, the Mr didn't like it at all. This being his first time he was confused as to why I went on and on until he took a bite of my patent pending salad, then it all made sense to him. The salads are just so complete and delicious!

I look forward to coming again.. I just hope that they can make a perfect copy of the original or go for a different feel entirely."}

I did not expect to have pizza this good in Arizona. The salad bar was very nice as well. You stick to the right side, you eat healthy with the create-your-salad. You stick to the left side, you can get a sinful pizza. (even the veggie pizza is full of grease) The middle is a typical hot plate grill.

{"text":"I thought it was pretty damn good to be honest.

Super speedy service as I was in the area to do my Taxes and figured with all the BEST OF signs that I'd see how much BS these guys were blowing up each others rears. 

I was surprised, the look was clean, fresh and professional. 

I had a California Turkey sandwich which believe it or not, actually contained warm sliced fresh turkey, what??? 

I'll be back because it's little things like that that really make a place stand out from the rest, and also, it's close to home :)"}
{"text":"My pizza was awesome, delicious baked thin crust with delicious tomatoes and goat cheese and I had salad where I chose the mix INS edame artichokes with the moraccan vinegarette-curry flavor. Very unique and tasty food, good people watching too -being near Kierland!"}
{"text":"I make a mean salad. Really. 

That's what I love about Market Bistro the most. For the same price as ice berg lettuce and carrot sticks at Souper Salad or Sweet Tomatoes (less, actually), I can direct someone to build  me a beautiful bounty of romaine, caramelized walnuts, red onion, fennel, parmesan crisps, strawberries, apples, blue cheese and top it with tri-tip and balsamic! 

Or, like I had today: parmesan crisps, tomatoes, fennel, mushrooms, blue cheese, red onion and pesto chicken.  All of the ingredients are very fresh and you get to pick any seven. I suggest the half salad ($5.29 + $2.29 for meat), because it's enough to satisfy. Especially, if you want to skip the meat and pair it with a slice of pizza (their pesto is frickin' awesome!!) or a half sandwich (I'm partial to the Cuban, myself). 

I love, love, love the poblano corn chowder.

The whole experience feels so healthy, it's my favorite place to go after a hike up North mountain or a nighttime yoga class (they're open until 9 p.m.!)... and, don't have to feel as guilty when I add a glass of wine or a beer.

Minus one star for the following:
* The line gets LONG at lunch time (like to the door - and, while you can \"cut\" to the grill counter and order if you just want a sandwich, most of us are there for our own awesome salad experiments.)
* It's loud and difficult to have a conversation (or a lunch meeting)
* Depending on what you order, you may need eight arms or four trips to carry it all to the table
* I wish a piece of bread came with the salads (only comes with the soup, right now).

But none of these are reason enough to keep me from coming back... In fact, I feel potatoes, black beans and rice as mix-ins in my future..."}
{"text":"This place feels like it has great potential, but I have yet to be wow'ed a second time since my initial visit. The most recent visit is fresh in my mind, so I'll stick to that one in this review. I got the Market Tri-Tip sandwich which is composed of: grilled carved rosemary tri-tip, horseradish mayo, pickled onions with arugula tossed in oregano vinaigrette on ciabatta. The ingredients do seem like they are of pretty good quality, but the execution is off. I couldn't actually taste the beef in the sandwich, and there wasn't all that much in there. The only reason I knew the meat was there was because of the tough texture I had to fight through to break off a bite. I felt like like I was eating a horseradish mayo and pickled onion sandwich on some great bread. I picked up notes of the rosemary, but it had a hard time coming through that pickled onion, luckily the pickled onion is quite good. 

Let me say this though, I got one of their turkey sandwiches when I went for the first time and I thought it was a great sandwich. I had it back in April or something though so don't remember enough about it to really talk about it...

So, the ambiance...I like being in this place. I could sit there and hangout with a group and talk all night, it's a comfortable relaxing setting for a sandwich place...especially when you consider some of the alternatives. They serve beer here and offer a decent selection. The people I have exchanged words with behind the counter all seemed friendly enough, but surprisingly had little advice to offer on menu items since they had not tried the things I was asking about. I guess the prices are about right because of what they are trying to make, but when they fall short like on my most recent visit I don't have a warm fuzzy feeling about the money spent. 

Overall, if you haven't been here yet, the place is worth a try. I live right around the corner from this place so when I don't feel like going far from home for dinner I go back and try it again, but personally, this isn't a place I would go out of my way to eat at."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is a consistent favorite. The 'create your own salad bowl' (greens + choice of 7 mix-ins) and optionally topped with your choice of grilled meat (tri tip, chicken, turkey) is a lunch time win win, they do offer some 'go to salad favorites' if you're not feeling salad creative, along with hearty sandwiches. It's an order first, pay & seat yourself establishment, with quality ingredients.

Be prepared for a line during peak hours (it does move quickly folks, but pack your patience anyway - cuz it makes my waiting more pleasurable). Table turn over is usually quick & there is an outside patio area (unfortunately it's on a busy path, adjacent to a parking lot that services Safeway). Service is always above par, accommodating & friendly."}
{"text":"I have driven by several times and was looking to get a bite to eat on my way home. Noticed the best of Phoenix signage not knowing what to expect. I took a look at the menu as I walked in and was intrigued. I must admit that I am a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to dining. Not feeling like branching out too much I picked the BLT. The service was super fast and the sandwich was fantastic! It was like euphoria for the mouth. 

The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. Dining opportunities like this make me want to try new things. I am sincerely excited to go back, try something new and that I tried this place out."}
{"text":"Friendly service, large portions...
I went for lunch today and I really like the concept of this fast-casual, healthy bistro.

I went during the busy lunch hour, so I shouldn't have been surprised by the crowd.  But it took a really long time to wait in line and place my order.  Good thing I was in good company - Marcus D can make the time go by anywhere... (you know he's good when he can capture my fiance's attention even with his major ADD).  

I designed my own salad (7 ingredients + turkey), and Marcus went with a turkey sandwich.  The salad was huge!  The house balsamic dressing was recommended but I wasn't a fan.  I was happy I requested it on the side because I took it right back up and exchanged it for ranch instead - much better!  Not sure why, but the salad was just ok.  I would request avocado and garbanzo toppings next visit... and a protein other than the turkey.  Marcus seemed to enjoy his sandwich.

Overall, my first experience at Market Bistro was a-ok... I'll be back but I am not in a huge rush.  Perhaps I'll try a sandwich or soup next visit."}
{"text":"So, after I read some of the reviews I was a little shocked but then again.  I wasn't!  I wasn't shocked because I too have been to a few places where I did not like the first meal, but saw that I like the place, liked the staff and environment.  So, I re-read the reviews again.  And, the only one that stands out (because I like wine) was Marks review... not because it was negative... it was not accurate. 

\"Two of us shared a small bottle of merlot wine ($14).   It poured two glasses of medium quality wine.  It was just OK.  For $7 a glass I was thought it should have been better.\"

First they do not have a Merlot 1/2 bottle.  Second if they did and you were drinking merlot, half the time its barley assisting the food in the pairing.  & third the wine selection they have is super (go for the primus-it killer)!  The Half bottles concept is great.  You can share the bottle with a friend, sip it by yourself while enjoying the \"create your own salad\" (which is the best way to \"shock your taste buds with great, quality add on's that you would never try at home) or while enjoying a slice with a friend or 2.  Now back to the wine.  And, if you are sipping BYS and you like the wine, you can take it home, while only paying 12.00 not $24.00 + for a full bottle.... all the wines are under $12.. That is awesome....

Will I return to Market Bistro? For sure I did last night.  I had the Arizona Tri-tip, side of Mac-n-cheese, and One bottle of the Primus- 2005 Red blend from Chile.  A great balanced wine, with bold, ripe fruits and lively red tannins that went perfectly with the sired Arizona tri-tip!  I had two small glasses and went home for the night.... Around 930 I polished the Primus off and today here I sit - thinking.... I might go back on Thursday.  This time with a friend!"}
{"text":"Market Bistro is the newest addition to my work lunch portfolio.  The menu has a nice selection of salads, sandwiches and pizza, but honestly the salads are so great that I, or anyone who I have gone with, haven't ventured beyond the greens.  

The setup of Market Bistro is similar to the logistics of a Chipotle -- ultimate customization -- but they will bring your food out to you when it's done.  For grilled-to-order chicken, the 2 minutes is definitely worth the wait!  They serve beer and wine (only to tempt me during work hours, I think).  I crave their Citrus Basil salad, which is delicious and even more satisfying when you add chicken and unshelled edamame.  My friends have really enjoyed the \"build your own\" salad option, which has a huge variety of toppings, from artichoke hearts to fennel to pine nuts.

This place is definitely going to steal some of my lunch money market share from Zipps (sorry Monaco Focaccia)."}
{"text":"Market Bistro is AWESOME for anybody who likes a good salad!  I was sad & disappointed that DISH closed because that's where I would get my veggie fix before, but I'm so glad to have found Market Bistro!  I think the salad bar is better and they have a better variety of ingredients that you can choose.  My favorites are the candied walnuts, fennel, edamame beans, fresh beets, and the delicious chicken that's grilled while I wait.  The portions are HUGE and it's a great value for right around 10 bucks!

I haven't tried anything else on the menu but they also have sandwiches and pizza."}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to stop at Zipp's and get some wings, but the wait was going to be too long. We decided to eat lunch at Market Bistro instead and we're glad we did.

He had a Turkey Club and I had a Caesar Salad with steak. The sandwich was large with a smoky flavor (according to him). The Caesar was made right in front of my eyes with fresh ingredients and just the right amount of dressing. 

I would give them five stars save for two things. The salad had a little too much garlic for my liking (and I LOVE garlic) and the restaurant was a little unkempt.

I hope to get by there again soon."}
{"text":"Market Bistro gets a four stars from me because the food is delicious and is something unique, that I couldn't easily make at home.
The sandwiches are made with fresh meats rather than processed lunch meat and the meats are grilled to order.  The sauces are delicious and the produce and breads are all fresh. The soups are savory and the restaurant is clean. My sons and I can't wait to go back to try the chicken ceaser salad, which looks great!"}
{"text":"It was late evening after flying in, and we were quite hungry. We were headed to meet up with the rest of the baseball team at their condo and knew they had pizza. But, 9+ guys with 2 large pizzas, not likely to get any by the time we get there. So, we went shopping at Safeway for good for the week and for breakfast and found this place in the same plaza. 

We walked in and the place looked pretty good. A great grill and salad making station and the place was pretty full. The menu looked pretty darn good and I wanted just about one of everything. I was craving some beef, wo whatever it was, it would have some tri tip on it. I thought I should start off the week with something remotely healthy, so a salad was on the agenda. The pre-mades looked pretty good, but then I noticed the salad \"create you own\" with 7 mix ins and several choices of dressings. MMMMM perfect to me. So, black beans, artichoke hearts, edamame, blue cheese, sun dried tomatoes, cranberries, and  I chose the chipotle dressing. They plop it all in a huge bowl and mix it up for you. Humongous for roughly the price of a big restaurant salad.

SG got a pesto chicken sandwich, which I assume he liked, since he did not share, nor make any comments about. He did eat a bunch of my salad and really seemed to like it. He almost did not want to give it back. Its all good. We both seemed to enjoy our dinners and we got to share the one remaining piece of pizza back at the condo. 

Check it out!"}
{"text":"They have great salads & sandwiches .. you can create your own salad your order one from the menu .. you can also had tri tip, chicken or pork to your salad ... The Ceasar salad is the best I've had in Phoenix.

Also has a quant atmosphere .. good for dining in or take out .. and it's healthy for you =)"}
{"text":"I frequently dine at Market Bistro about twice a week. I LOVE the \"Build Your Own\" salads. The ingredients are ALWAYS super fresh, and the value is beyond compare... especially for the area it is in North Scottsdale.

Often time I will be in the Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter area, and given the vast choice of restaurants in the vicinity, I will almost ALWAYS choose to make the 3 minute car ride over to Market Bistro. The food is almost always better... and ALWAYS cheaper for what you get. 

Things to try... you won't be sorry... the Cuban Sandwich, the BBQ TriTip Steak Sandwich, and the Southwest Corn Chowder! ALL AMAZING!

They have some wine, and bottled beer."}
{"text":"***FYI.... AS OF 11/2/2011 IT LOOKS LIKE MARKET BISTRO IS OUT OF BUSINESS!!!!  IT IS SAD... AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.***

Their Facebook and Twitter accounts are also deactivated."}
{"text":"This place has been here 7 years and we have never been. Are you kidding me? The food is excellent. The people who work here are friendly and seem to be happy to be there, which is most important. I tried the make your own half salad and half sandwich. YUMMY!!! There are many choices for salad toppings. There us nothing I like more than a huge, fresh salad. I chose to top my salad with avocado, tomato, bacon, edemame, feta cheese, and whipped balsamic vinaigrette. I really think this was the best salad I have ever had! They make the salad in front of you and mix in the perfect amount of dressing. I chose the chicken pesto sandwich. The combo of these items was a perfect portion for this hungry girl. The sandwich was excellent. My hubby ordered the Cuban pork sandwich. This is one huge sandwich! It was difficult to get his mouth around it, but once he did, it was awesome!! Typically, we don't like coleslaw, but it was really good, especially combined with the tender pork. We will return to the Market Bistro, again and again. 
Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum & YUM!!!  I can't believe how much we loved this bistro.  While vacationing in the area, we ended up eating here three times in 4 days and wishing they were open earlier so we could grab a last bite before jumping on the plane.  It was THAT good!

I had their Turkey BLT, and my hubby had a tri tip sandwich with extra meat.  YUM!!!

They had a decent outdoor dining area, and always lots of smiles and helpful pleasant attitudes.

Oh, and to top it off, aside from the tasty beers, the even had fresh cooked chocolate butterscotch rice krispy treats behind the counter.  DOES IT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS???

The only sad part is I don't live close enough to go there every day :(  It seems odd to me to put a 5 star on a bistro, but it just floats my boat, and I will be back some day :)"}
{"text":"Long time fan and lover of Market Bistro. Everything is always soo fresh and flavorful, and the fact it's family owned I think adds a lil special something. I've had nothing but positive experiences, anytime I've visited this establishment, and definitely go out of my way (which isn't too far) to get a healthy alternative from this spot. 

I recently tweeted about having a craving for one of their amazing salads, and was shortly informed via a tweet from them, that they had a special going; Check in via Facebook places and snag an opportunity to get a free entree or pizza! DING! That evening I went in to market and again was given the best service and dinner tasted even better, who knew! 

Keep an eye out for their specials and deals. They even have a VIP email sign up on their site. They're pretty socially active as well ,  so If you're not already on the Twitter network, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"Food here is legit and wholesome.

Corn chowder soup is really good and there are some decent vegetarian options.

Quick service, food made on the spot.

I really favor the restaurant but no waiter type place because the service is faster and you don't have to tip anyone. Also, you're getting high quality food vs fast food joints where I refuse to eat ever again."}
{"text":"Ok, I give up... how are pizza and salad like Boston Market?  I guess they both have food.  I can't see ANYTHING similar other than that.

This is a little bistro that sells salads made to your specs, sandwiches the way you choose, and another version of not real pizza (but it tastes good) also served the way you want it. 

They have a wide variety of beverages ranging from sodas, teas and coffees to beer and wine.  The view on the patio isn't bad for being on a main street, and the owner treats the young counter help (when the place opened they were all friends of the family) like family.... so they treat the clientelle like family as well. Good formula for neighborhood success.

If you want roast turkey with a side of creamed spinach and mashed potatoes, don't come here.  Go to Boston Market."}
{"text":"Classic \"Good Food Served Quickly\"

Places like Market Bistro  make me wonder why anyone would opt for fast food when presented with this option. 

Fresh ingredients prepared right on the spot: viewable grill & salad prep area (I remember looking down at all the salad ingredients laid out and thought \"wow. now THAT would be a kick-ass salad bar.\") 

Delicious options of sammies, salads, and pizza (some super creative ones at that). Fairly quick turnaround for being made-to-order and a really nice atmosphere for being located in a standard strip mart area off a main road. A group of friendly, happy employees who are obviously enjoy working here....always a plus.

--

I came here twice (though stupid android yelp app failed 2nd time, le sad) and thoroughly enjoyed both meals.

ARRRRRIZZZZONNNNA Salad. omgomgomg. i could eat that everyday, nom. I opted to do 1/2 & 1/2 with this salad each time I enjoyed it so much.

Market Turkey - Listed as the special when I was there. hot open-faced turkey and cranberry sammie - i mean...obviously.

Turkey BLT on focaccia (typically doesnt come on this) - delicious and flavorful. perhaps slightly dry but i enjoyed.

Basically...this is a place where you could order anything off the menu and be happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how in the universe this place received anymore than one star!! 

Hot Stuff- Man o man I went in around 4ish , thinking I could beat the dinner group and get a little work , (ha ha Yelping)lol, on my comp. And I should have worn my swimsuit and misty mate. It was incredibly hot, and I understand we live in AZ but it was unbearable. They are aware so they have put in these huge loud windy fans. which i felt I had no choice but to sit my them in order to not pass out. Only to have my hair blowing all over making it difficult to eat.

Wi-fi- OOOHHHHH wait there is none . I just feel in this type of environment it is a must, if they want to compete with Paradise Bakery at all.

Nom Noms- after wanted a hot sandwich but too warm so I went with a make my own salad, if i remember correctly, i got a choice of lettuce and up to 7 mix ins, which was the only good part. Lots of options to pick from,and knowing i made my own selections i cant complain about the overall taste. However i used 3 options for additional eggs, but no request for EGGSHELLS, which i received.:(

Service- with me being the only one in the place, it took about 2-3 minutes for any acknowledgment. which it a while if your just standing in a hot place.

Break it down girl- With places such a Tossed and Paradise bakery, and now even Wendy's offing huge healthy Salad options and lower prices, I will not go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place when you are just looking for a good salad.  They make it right in front of you, and they have every ingredient you could imagine.  What they have off the grill is delicious too.  I really enjoy the AZ Tri-Tip Sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or casual supper, a welcome alternative to all the chains in the AZ strip malls.  I got hooked on the AZ salad and tri-tip, and the sandwich breads are outstanding.  Especially like the variety, the freshness of the veggies and the creative dressings.  Have yet to try the pizza, but heard it is really good and I will do so on my next visit to Scottsdale.  A little on the pricey side for lunch, like some have said, but the quality and variety is worth the difference .  Decor is a bit wanting, but OK."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch if you find yourself in the area. I love that the salads and sandwiches are made to order, enabling you to control every aspect of your meal. 
I had the special when I went, a chipotle chicken sandwich. It had green chilies, corn, black beans and a chipotle dressing. It was delicious. They also had great music playing, nice down tempo (obscure to most people) at an acceptable volume. 
 
2 drawbacks
The place was not busy, yet every table was dirty and when I asked to have a table bussed I got the \"can't you see I'm lazy\" look.
No soap in the restroom. Yuck."}
{"text":"Market Bistro never leaves me disappointed. The people are great.
The food is ALWAYS good & it doesn't matter what you get, they will cater to your needs & wants.

Definitely a must if your coming to Phoenix or if you live here, you need to try it."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a tasty sandwich and enjoy a modern looking bistro.  Located near 7th St and Thunderbird it's a perfect location to enjoy a bite before or after hiking up the nearby mountains(North Mtn, Shaw Butte, Lookout Mtn).  I'd say if you're in the area it's worth checking out.

Not the biggest sandwiches, but the bread is as fresh as you will get.  The price is a little on the high side, only wish a side came with it as well.  Overall I think the abundant flavors that you get to enjoy puts this place above any of the sandwich chain restaurants.

The decor is comprised of stainless steel and wood.  Very nice and cool looking with soothing music playing in the background.  Unlike some of the other reviews, it was busy with all of the empty tables clean and ready to be sat at.  So hopefully this has been an issue that has been resolved.

I'll be back, but not on a daily or weekly basis."}
{"text":"Quality ingredients and good recipes ruined by bad chefs.  The caesar salad had no flavor.  It tasted like lettuce, water and shaved parmesan.  The pepperoni pizza had obviously been sitting a while.  It was so dried out and all the pepperoni slices were even curled up at the edges.  The crust was like bisquick.  It tasted just like a frozen pizza.  The chipotle barbecue chicken sandwich was served ice cold, which I guess is ok but they really need to warn you.  It's not too much of a stretch to assume a barbecue sandwich will be hot.  $17 dollars later, and we're still hungry.  

Their routine is way too complicated for them not to be on the lookout for newbies and tell them what to do.  They seemed to get their entertainment sitting quietly behind their counters watching all the customers wander around aimlessly like bumper cars.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"The AZ tri-tip sandwich is awesome.  Full of flavor.  Meat is usually pretty tender but every now-and-then can be a little tough.  I have not had any of the salads or pizzas but hear they are good as well.

I would recommend pre-ordering via phone or internet with about a 30 min lead time.  If you are short on time and just walk in to order prepare to be late to wherever it is you are going.  Wait time is not terrible but I just hate sitting around waiting...especially when I am hungry.  :)

11-8-09 Update:

Now I can Attest that the Chicken Pesto and Cuban Pork sandwiches are also amazing.  All three are entirely different in terms of flavor/texture complexities.  Also the last couple of times I have been there the wait times were significantly less."}
{"text":"So, when I heard that this place had it's own Pandora radio station, I just had to check them both out.  The station is alright, eclectic and I'll add it to my light rotation.  It was a good thing I checked it out online, since when we got to the restaurant, I couldn't actually hear it...

Nice, open atmosphere, bright and clean, and good breads upon which to load good stuff!  AZ Tri-Tip was good, nicely seasoned and tender, and the better half had the Market Tri-Tip and the rosemary came through nicely.  

Some friends had raved about the cookies - and they -were- good, but I'm not sure deserving of the rabid nature of the recommendation.  The lemon with lemon icing was by far the better option - very lemony and my tongue danced with the brightness of it all.  And while I love me my carrot cake and tend to find the best in any attempt, I was less than enamored with the carrot cake cookie.  It tasted fine, but fell apart while eating, was a little too raisiny - so if you like messy, go for it.

We'll be back, and hopefully the music will be playing!"}
{"text":"Market Bistro offers homemade soups, salads, and really fresh sandwiches. I liked the modern decor, staff, and clientele. Very casual - a great lunch spot... (the sandwiches are really big - try splitting one)."}
{"text":"Friday night early. Pizza satisfactory, Caesar salad lacking in tangy taste. Cashier, also the wine uncorker had not idea how to do it. Staff seemed to be rushing around without too much guidance.

Our take - okay for takeout, not for dine-in"}
{"text":"I saw Jim's lunch (grilled sourdough with pesto, mozzarella, basil and tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar and olive oil) (see picture  I posted) and my mouth was watering. I wanted to try that baby so I called to see if I could talk him into making me one! I must have caught him in a good mood because he made me one. I am telling you it was absolutely awesome! Took it home with the rest of my order...My car now smells like pesto- (Hmmm- new air freshener idea). Everyone is mad because I would not share it! The best part was using the bread to sop up the oil and vinegar at the end. YUM! Jim thank you so much for allowing me to try it- please put it on the menu!

My husband had the smoked chicken pizza and my son had the turkey BLT. They both loved it. I also got a carrot cake cookie and giant peanut butter cookie and they loved them too. If you have not tried this place- go give them a try. They will mix and mingle their ingredients to make you happy.. ALL fresh ALL the time!"}
{"text":"This pizza and sandwich shop is uberdelicious!  I don't get in often as it's not in my neighborhood, but everything I've ever tried here is fantastic.  If they had one in my neighborhood I'd eat there multiple times a week."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Westin, and went into this bistro almost everyday. The staff was the best! Very helpful, friendly, and great with our little one. The salads were good, and my husband had several of the sandwiches and he loved them as well! I recommend going in if your at the hotel!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I picked the wrong item...the Arizona Salad, but I was not a fan and it was quite spicy!!  Yes there was a pepper symbol next to it as a warning, but it needs 2-3 peppers.  We also ordered the Arizona sandwich -- a little bland and bread was not my favorite. 

Better luck next time..."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. They have the best salads, and they are HUGE! Even when you get the soup and salad (great tomato soup!), the \"side salad\" is still huge! It's a little pricey for salads, but I think it's worth it. It's the only place I know where the \"build your own salad\" comes with seven topping options, and they don't charge extra for avocado. I've never tried the pizza or sandwiches, but they look great, and back when I used to eat chicken, I thought their pesto chicken (on my salad) was really good.
Enjoy!"}
