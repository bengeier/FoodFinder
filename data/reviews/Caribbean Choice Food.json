{"text":"Great spot. Good food and nice owner. I get my Caribbean spices from here as well. Food prices are a bit high for my liking."}
{"text":"I wish we had more Caribbean options in Calgary but this one is pretty good.    Simple place and feels like you're in Jamaica.  I only ever have the ox tail and it's pretty good.  Very filling.   I keep saying to myself that I will try the jerk chicken each time but I always end up having the oxtail.  Closed early so really more for lunch or early dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place! Bernice always makes me feel welcome and even remembers my name - who does that, eh? In a world of automated phone interactions (Say \"agent\", I'm sorry. I didn't get that. Say \"agent\", I'm sorry. I didn't get that. Say \"agent\"....ugh), we really need the human touch and that's what you get in this place. The food is yummy and my husband is very happy when I bring him a take out goat curry from Bernice's. Alternatively, you can sit down at a table and eat your delicious meal in the shop. It's such a relief to find West Indian food, prepared by West Indians, in Calgary. When I first came to Calgary from Toronto 20 years ago, it was one of the first things I missed. A big shout out to Caribbean Choice Food!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine and I drove to Calgary for a day all the way from Jasper to shop and basically eat nonstop. 

I saw this place in Yelp! and was convinced by the highly positive reviews to visit it. I was happy that I did.

I ordered the beef patties and jerk chicken dinner. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh, that's all I have to say. Jerk chicken was flavourful and not dry. The rice was also great and the veggies that came along was great. I wish I asked for extra sauce though, I would've liked it a bit more saucy (that's just my personal preference).

I definitely will come back next time I hit up Calgs. Maybe try their rotis, oxtail and curry goat next time....... Thinking about it right now makes me drool.

Oh and lady at the counter was lovely and nice!"}
{"text":"Corner store in that Centre street strip mall, that features a \"massage\" parlour, comes this little gem! Its mainly a store with Caribbean products, but it does have a small menu of classic jamaican dishes, such as jerk chicken and Roti (Stuffed with goodness). The flavors are authentic and very yuuuuum. And their meat patties are top-shelf! 

Parking sucks and they only have 4 little tables but if ya like to try something different, come check out this hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Carribean Choice Foods is a fun and authentic place to get your Carib culinary products and a tasty meal to stay or go. If you've spent some time on the islands and you're a fan of beans, rice and spicy (not ridiculous spicy) Jamaican curry, this could quickly become the lunch spot for you.

The walls are lined like a Carribean grocery store, and throughout the centre and front window are tables for you to hang out and enjoy your food from the kitchen. Being an Alberta boy, not well versed in the ways of the Carribean, I found the attitude of the place to be unusually and enjoyably relaxed. Arriving a bit late for lunch, I asked if I could get a Chicken Curry. The pleasant lady at the till looked as if to think about it for a brief while before going \"uuhmm,okay. But it will be 7 minutes.\" At the time I thought as if I was asking for something unusual, but this is one of the menu item, and I feel like this just might be the way of the shop

The chicken, while deliciously spiced with Jamaican curry was at least half bone and cartilage. There were large masses of chicken but it was still difficult to get a mouth-full without spitting the undesirable pieces back into the styrofoam container. Is this authentic? Unfortunately, I'm too uneducated to say. The atmosphere is laid back and I was the only person without a thick Jamaican sounding accent and I very much enjoyed the food.

A fun combination of tasty food and enjoyable quirk leave me excited to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a small grocery store of popular Caribbean staples with a take-out counter. There's really only 2-3 tables that probably can seat 8-10 people and pretty much fill up the whole place so it's not really a place you can count on to sit in and eat. There's curry and jerk dishes on the menu. They have Jamaican patties ready to go all the time but I still prefer Lloyd's. I've tried the goat curry and oxtail as well as the jerk chicken and I have to say the jerk chicken is, to me, the best of the lot. The curry is uninteresting, not really much flavour other than it's curry and has a bit of heat. They make their own hot sauce but I didn't really give it a good enough try to comment on. Service is friendly. I'd go back for the jerk chicken."}
{"text":"I love Carribean markets they always remind me of going shopping with mom's. The smell of the spices and the food the customer service it feels like home. This shop doesn't disappoint. They've been around for over a decade so they're doing something right. If you're looking for Caribbean ingredients then this place is worth the stop."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a hothead. I love hot and spicy food, the more the better.

So, when I saw Carribean Choice Foods tucked into the corner of the strip mall across from Lina's I just had to try it.

You are not eating here for the decor. It's a tiny shop in an industrial looking space with a few tables, shelves stocked with various products, a drink cooler and a counter where you order.

The menu is a short, but good, representation of Jamaican food. Curry chicken, curry goat, jerk chicken, roti and patties. 

I had the curried chicken and my lady had the vegetarian roti. Both were bright yellow from the curry and equally as fragrant. 

My curry chicken came with rice and beans and a smattering of coleslaw. Be warned, this food is *authentic*, bone-in, skin still on authentic. It's not good first date food because you'll be spitting out bits here and there. Otherwise, it was a forceful, filling dish that cleared my head and sated my hunger. Not to mention giving me a wicked hot pepper buzz for at least 30mins after.

The roti was chock full of chickpeas, corn and potatoes in a soft roti wrapper. The staff behind the counter was also nice enough to mention that the potatoes are cooked with chicken and that they can leave them out for more strict vegetarians. This was more mild then the curry chicken but still flavourful.

Drink wise, I went with the homemade ginger beer. The day-glow yellow brew smacked me in the face (and nose) with ginger. I wasn't prepared but afterwards I loved it and it cut through the heat (and my sinuses) wonderfully.

We also picked up a few odds and ends, homemade jerk seasoning among them. There's also standards like Blue Mountain coffee and an entire rack of brightly coloured hot sauces.

The staff seemed to know many of the customers by name and we were (obviously) the least Jamaican out of any of them but the service was still warm and friendly.

Of course, the meals arrived on \"island time\" but were worth the wait and the $10 a plate price tag. 

If you're looking to go somewhere warm on a budget, this is about as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Talk about entering out of the cold, the produce here, the fresh made food, the employees and the customers make you feel that you are on the islands in plus 36 degrees weather.  

There are basically two rows of food here, mostly staples, rice, teas, spices, beans, and the sauces. A very nice selection of exotic hot sauces here, Tamarind Date, Trinidad Style, Red pepper, Hot pepper, and West Indian Sauce just to name a few. 
 
The take out or in menu consisted of Jamaican Patties for 2 dollars, and Coco Bread.  There is Curried Chicken, Curried Goat, Curried Ox Tail, Jerk Chicken, Curried Chicken, Beef and Goat Roti all for around 10 dollars.

All prices are reasonable and there was a small line up of regulars with tons of laughing and island stories spiralling around.  It was so contagious we were all laughing in the end and you really did feel like you were sitting on the beach in the Caribbean sipping on your island rum or ginger beer.

The owners were so warm and friendly that they gave me a 2010 mini calendar to take home.  Ahhhh so nice warming up the soul for a brief moment today."}
