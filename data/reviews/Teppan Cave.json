{"text":"Loved It!  My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch. The food was excellent. It's hard to find good Japanese food in the suburbs and I was happy to stumble upon this place. It is tucked away in the back of a plaza and if we hadn't gone exploring then we wouldn't have seen it. My boyfriend and I tried the okonomiyaki and it was quite good. I can't wait to try the teppanyaki. I grew up loving Japanese food because of my Japanese cousins and I have a lot of respect for those who know how to cook it well. Thank you for the wonderful and welcoming experience. Might I add that the prices are reasonable, despite the deceiving price tag. We both ate for less that $30."}
{"text":"Being a fanatic of Japanese steakhouse this restaurant totally surprised us with the quality of food and the service to the point of us going back next week for a mystery meal prepared by the chef I highly recommend to anyone wanting to try something new or just fora great meal"}
{"text":"Authentic teppanaki with chef's own take in blending different flavours to achieve both smokey and rustic flavours. Came for the first time today and truly impressed at the r&d he did with his menu. Highly recommended for anyone who wants a over the top teppanaki experience."}
{"text":"So first off i want to say this place is very hard to find if you don't know the area. If you go by your gps you will pass it at least twice.  So if you go note ot is opposite of the Esso gas station behind the Italian fashion building.  Now for the restaurant. Its very small sits 20 people max. there are tables along the front window and a table around the chef so you can watch him cook.  I went with my fiancee and two good friends because we had a groupon. Let me make this clear, if I didn't have the groupon I would not have gone. Even after being there I wish I hadn't as the groupon is misleading and the restaurant doesn't tell you till you get there.  They offer the chef tasting menu on the groupon but when you get there they have a different menu that's less than what your expecting.  The chef doesn't put on a show or anything, you might as well not bother watching. He doesn't talk to you. The 2 staff working there speak very little English so don't except much communication either.  The only good experience we had is all of us order different items and tried them all. The Japan beef, crispy chicken, teriyaki salmon and scallops. Don't get me wrong they were all tasty (thanks to the sauce), just very very small. Most of your plate is filled with vegetables that taste bland, could have use some sauce or seasoning.  Over all if you want good food and fun atmosphere go to Heart Sushi, your never disappointed there.  ***See pictures for more details.***"}
{"text":"Authentic Teppanyaki, you need to go all out when you come here. We came as a group and I really had no idea what was in store for me. We had started with a salad, grilled squid (kinda like jerky), a seafood soup that had fish liver, iberco pork and wagyu beef. I have not had Iberco in a long time mainly because I find it very pricey and some places don't do the meat justice when preparing. Teppan cave does a good job of keeping the flavour of the meat while infusing smokiness in. Really enjoyed this. Wagyu is as expected, melt in your mouth goodness.   The chef definitely puts on a show and explains what everything is, I think anytime you have someone tell you what it is or how it's made it enriches the food experience. The waitress was very attentive and was quick to do refills or ask if we wanted anything else. I needed a charger from all the photos I was snapping and she went to search for one for me. So big thumbs up for service."}
{"text":"In summary: good food but not so great atmosphere   Teppanyaki is mainly about the atmosphere IMO. And unfortunately this place isn't very fun. Usually, the chef puts on a show as he cooks. However at this place he is merely cooking in front of you. He may as well be doing this hidden in a kitchen.  On top of that it's fairly small, and very quiet inside, which again is the opposite atmosphere of what these places are famous for.   That being said, the food was good.   We came here with a groupon and thought that it was worth the discounted price that we paid. However I think that the full undiscounted price is much too high. I was still hungry after I left.   Warning: it's quite hard to find. It didn't help that google maps took us to the wrong plaza. If you are coming from the 400 and get to the Esso, you have gone too far.  And when you make it to the correct plaza, its still a challenge to find it... so fyi It's on the very north east corner of the plaza.   Tip: I think you need to make reservations to get a seat at the main table (in front of the chef)"}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to have dinner. Alex the chef cook right in front of you. The quality is very good. The service is good and they will explain every dish they serve. Very interesting restaurant. Just to let you know it's not Japanese."}
{"text":"A cozy family owned restaurant in Vaughan.  We tried the Wagyu beef, Iberico pork, and scallops.  All were very delicious.  The Wagyu beef melted in your mouth.  The iberico pork was very tender.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant and excellent chef! The food is very fresh and prepared right infront of you. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere and the food is tasty.  The chef is very nice and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Very nice food, but only one chef, so be sure to get their early. Tasting menu is always recommended. The chef really knows what he's doing, so you will be surprised how well the tasting menu is.   Also, the place is very small so large groups would definitely need a booking."}
{"text":"This place is great. The service was excellent and I think it's a family run restaurant. The food was cooked perfectly and was definitely worth the money."}
{"text":"Best Teppanyaki I ever had!! This one definitely deserve 5 stars.  It's definitely a hidden gem.  It's not busy....yet!  Speed read:  1) Grilled eels, Iberico Pork, Beef Tendon 2) Feels like a casual dinner with the chef where he will teach us about food while we watch him cook 3) Direction: Vellore wood blvd, 2nd driveway to plaza, all the way to the end. 4) Can someone try to fois gras and tell me if it's good please?  Not easy to find.   Quick directions: Enter Vellore woods Blvd  then 2nd driveway to plaza, all the way to the end.  Service: Excellent service.  We get the attention from the chef and owner (Alex). He's not a great salesman speaker, but once I start asking questions about the food and cooking, he speak passionately about it while he cooks right in front of me.  So I feel like I am in a food show where i am having a casual dinner with a celebrity chef.  I like to learn about food.  I really don't need to see a cooking utensil tossing show.  Food - highlight: Okonomiyaki - Osaka style - made with cabbage and eggs, with bonito flakes on top. Tasty starter.  It doesn't have noodle in it, so it's not supposed to be filling.  Grilled eel (Unagi) - This is one of the highlight.   (Call ahead to pre-order) Most other Japanese restaurant serve eels loaded with sweet sauce that totally masked the original taste and they are from frozen eel.  Chinese restaurant tend to serve it steamed, but the eels usually taste fishy and earthy, in which they use ginger, garlic and other spice to get ride of the taste.    This eels is FRESH!!! The eels is freshly killed and cut right in front of us, and deboned.  It was still moving after after it's cut.  It's on the grill after it's cleaned.  I thought I can only see this in Japanese comic books. This grilled eels weight about 1.5 lbs, which is a good size, where it doesn't taste earthy, and yet have a good chewy texture.  (smaller eels usually feel mushy).  It's lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.  I can taste the fish's original taste, and excellent texture.  Black Iberico Pork - Another highlight! Best tasting pork ever.  It's grilled to medium-well done. I sprinkle rock salt on top before I eat it.  Again, I am not eating teppanyaki sauce here.  I am tasting the original pork flavor.  Put it in comparison to the Wagyu beef, I would rate this pork higher on the list.  The wagyu beef has rich fatty taste, but I prefer the pork that taste more meaty.  I ate it so quickly, that we forgot to take pictures.  Abalone and Tilefish serve in Mirin/sake/grill onion sauce. The fresh abalone is grilled with the shell in.  And then deshelled and cut in piece.  The abalone is not super chewy like the dry Chinese type.  Original abalone flavor. The tile-fish is a flaky fish grilled with the skin cut off (and grilled separately).  The fish skin (with the scale still on it) is very crispy.  The sauce and the tile fish blend in very well.  The fish is pretty good....but the eels stole the show :)  Beef Tendon -- Highlight!! - I didn't expect this in a teppanyaki. I love beef Tendon.  Alex told me it has been cook for about 4 hours.  Soft tendon, very flavorful with rice and Udon.  I was full, but I still manged to eat an entire bowl of rice after this.  Best Beef tendor i ever tried.  It's better than a lot of other Chinese/Taiwanese place I tried.  The only regret is that I didn't try the Fois gras, another reason I will go back.  Price:  It's reasonable price given the ingredient what we are served with.  Eels, Iberico pork, wagyu beef, abalone, are all premium ingredients.  I can cook my own salmon, scallops, but it takes a real chef to bring out the great taste of premium ingredients."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  Believe it or not, this place is actually worth it. However I don't think it's $$$$ as the page says, it's probably closer to $$ or $$$.  Teppan Cave is in the corner of a plaza, the first one on your right off Rutherford Road at Vellore Woods Drive. It's a small place, but since my parents and I arrived at ~8:30pm on a Tuesday, we managed to get a table and were the only ones there the entire time.  The menu is quite simple, you have the tasting menu options which provides an appetizer, main course, and ice cream at a fixed cost, and/or you also have items you can order separately. For our first visit, we had three tasting menus and added a beef tendon as well.  We ordered the seared scallops and cuttlefish, miso BBQ sauce chicken, and the angus beef rib eye. It comes with a house salad, okonomiyaki with tiger shrimps, rice, and miso soup. The house salad and rice were nothing special, but the miso soup was surprisingly rich. The okonomiyaki was decent, but considering it came with the menu I didn't really thought of it much. The seared scallops and cuttlefish was very good, along with the angus beef rib eye. The miso BBQ sauce chicken was good, although the sauce itself I couldn't really taste the miso feel.  After discussing with the teppan chef (who, by the way, is wonderful to talk to; you won't get the whole teppanyaki show but you get a casual conversation instead), he recommended us to try the beef tendon, which we did. I can safely say it was one of the best beef tendons I've eaten, very soft as well as tasty.  This place may be in Woodbridge, but I'd definitely return to try some other items, maybe in special occasions like Father's Day coming up. Service was wonderful; it's a family run restaurant so you know you're supporting local families. Definitely a hidden gem IMO."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service! We picked the $30 teppanyaki set, which included house salad, chicken, salmon, beef, vegetables, fried rice, miso soup and ice cream. Amazing flavours, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everything is great. This is my second time here, and trust me, you won't regret coming. It's not too expensive for the quality of food. I actually did struggle whether I should post this review or not, because this is a hidden gem and it is a small place. Once people find out, therr must be weeks of waiting before I can book a table. I tried the sea bass ($37) and the lamb ($30). I also tried the foie Gras ($37) last time. I love the lamb the best. I prob will try other more expensive dishes next time. Highly recommended. Words can't express how great it is, just come and try it out."}
{"text":"Delicious and everything is cooked to perfection. The service was excellent too. Well worth the drive. Definately will be back."}
{"text":"Lovely food lovely Staff and service. Will definitely go back. Food was good quality and on time. Very quiet place so the place felt very cozy."}
