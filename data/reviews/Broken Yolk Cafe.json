{"text":"Love this place! Great food & Great Service! Our waitress, Manda D, was awesome! Thank you for a great experience on our first time! Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Horrible! poached eggs were cooked through and the hash browns were raw and hard to eat!"}
{"text":"My son ordered a hot wrap ... it came to the table lukewarm.

Coffee tasted like it had grounds in it."}
{"text":"Horrible, food was cold, waiter forgot half our order, way over-priced. Not worth the high prices, needless to say, never going back."}
{"text":"Great brunch place, the food is good, better than some other places and you get a lot for the money. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I found a Groupon which led us to breakfast here this morning. The wait was about 25 minutes and could have used a couple of benches out front. The owner brought out warm blueberry muffins to tide us over. The Eggs Benedict was amazing with avocado and siracha sauce. The Dreamsicle mimosa was great, but just a hint, do NOT attempt to stir it! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Had the Golden Benadict. Fast and friendly will return."}
{"text":"My sister and I were looking for a good breakfast spot that we've never been to! This place is a better a version of Denny's and IHOP, much more cozy! Breakfast tastes homemade and the mimosa options are so great! They have a great drink menu & food menu! Very clean and home-like!"}
{"text":"Waited 45 minutes for food.  Had cold John Wayne omelet, was filled with canned mushrooms topped with canned chili. Wayyyy over-priced for this area. For a breakfast centered restaurant they should be making everything from scratch. It's breakfast! Wife had pancakes which were cold and tasted of flour. However, judging by the clientele waiting in line, if one is a snowbird, this is your place. I give this place until summer before the doors close. Now I've gotta go find something decent to eat, I'm hungry. Spent $40 and left pissed off and hungry!"}
{"text":"Starving. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I don't think i'll make it. The food is taking FOREVER. Apparently the kitchen staff lost my family's order and we have been waiting over an hour for our food to arrive. The manager finally managed to come out of his fox hole from the back of the kitchen to give us a 50% discount on our meal. The waitress lacked emotion and empathy and seemed to have the brain of a ferrel cat. It seems the yolk has really been broken at this place. Lord have MERCY!"}
{"text":"After just moving into a home in the area and being all tired and beat up from an overnighter painting session, my fiancee and I decided to try out this place for a nice hot breakfast. I was pretty impressed with the food, the portion sizes were large for the price and the service was great (although to be fair, I should point out that we went early on a weekday and the restaurant was empty). I'll be back, especially if those hash browns are just as good every time."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast spot! Owners go out of their way to make the experience worth while.  Have tried most of the menu and have never been disappointed!  Everything is made fresh. The portions are good size. Wait staff friendly and can keep up. Always busy on weekends. Only gripe is that I wish they would leave a carafe of coffee, instead of waiting for the server to fill it up.  All in all, Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had heard some great things about this place, and since it is super close I thought I'd try it out for a mid week breakfast.

Unfortunately I don't have anything good to report.  It took a good 5 minutes for anyone to appear in the dining room/ entrance to notice that a customer came in, so I was standing at the empty hostess stand contemplating leaving right then.  Wish I had.

The one waitress in the place was nice enough, but called me a term of endearment which was not appreciated coming from a teenager.  I ended up paying about $3 for one and a half tiny cups of coffee because nobody offered to refill it or come close enough to refill it.  Someone who I'm guessing was the manager came over, pot in hand, and asked me how my meal was and promptly walked away without asking to fill the coffee.  I had to call him back to ask.  Unfortunately by that time I was basically done with my meal.

And by done with my meal I mean done trying to eat what was served.  I guess the kitchen ran out of salt, because even my corned beef and hash was bland.  Potatoes had absolutely no seasoning on them either.  The eggs came under cooked for what I asked as well.

The place is also horribly over priced for what it was.  I got the 'American Breakfast\" 2 eggs, a meat, a carb, and a potato. was $10 or more, coffee was $2.50ish, and orange juice as $3 something.  All together my meal was over $17 for a breakfast and service that will make sure I will never return.  Pretty sure I can get the same breakfast at Postino's for cheaper."}
{"text":"My bacon omelet with homefries was bland. The waitress forgot my muffin.  All this might be forgivable if not for the insanely high prices. Mesa isn't San Diego and the prices here are out of line compared to similar breakfast joints in the area.
Honestly, the food, service and prices are better at Village Inn or iHop."}
{"text":"First time at this location but I've been to several locations in San Diego. I got to say the food style is a bit different like chilaquiles in San Diego will be serve with shredded chicken were as here is serve with chunks of chicken. But the taste is always delicious, hot and fresh. Lets not forget the customer service as always friendly and attentive to our needs. Definitely I will be returning to this new found location. If u get a chance try their breakfast sandwich Monte cristo and also the Tijuana style street tacos.."}
{"text":"The breakfast I had here is great! I built my own omelet with tomatoes, mushrooms, and pork sausage with pepper jack cheese. It was well portioned (4 eggs) and the hash browns were excellent. They even added a fresh baked blueberry muffin. All in all, good food for the money spent!"}
{"text":"I've eaten there 4 times the quality of the food and the cooking has been superb! Will continue to eat here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Great food and great service at a reasonable price.  I took my family of five out for breakfast to celebrate Mother's Day.  We were able to get a table in a reasonable amount of time and our waitress Sarah did a great job on a busy frantic Mother's Day morning.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, friendly staff and hands on owners. My husband and I had a delicious brunch, large portions, quick service and great cup of coffee. We will be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"We just went there for breakfast and my boyfriend sat in puke! The situation was handled very unprofessionally. The hostess didn't believe us then tried to seat us back in the same booth after they \"cleaned\" it. It was disgusting and no one was empathic to the situation. We just left disgusted and hungry."}
{"text":"We both had a Border Benedict. (We love trying new eggs Benedict variations.) It was good, but probably neither of us would get it again. The meat around the eggs was a bit underseasoned. Other menu items looked great. Service was great and we were seated immediately."}
{"text":"I introduced my parents to the Yolk in San Diego. This location is just like the ones back home...AMAZING. the food is always excellent, but what sets this site apart is the outstanding customer service. My parents now go here almost every morning for bfast. I just visited them and they brought me here. The owner, manager, and staff welcomed us like family. They all stopped by the table to say hi and to make sure we were well taken care of. Then I noticed, they did this with every patron there. I was very impressed with the atmosphere they created. Manda is the best."}
{"text":"I went there this morning with my boyfriend for some breakfast. I got the no name omelet and added spinach and cheddar cheese, sour cream on the side. She forgot to put it on the side but the omelet was good. Wasnt great though. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy,he enjoyed it. Hash browns were crispy and delish. Our server had black hair and she was super peppy and attentive! I would go their again"}
{"text":"The food was really good but our service was terrible! When they brought our food they took it to the table behind us and anything we asked for they would give to the people behind us... The same person we asked would do this!!!! On top of that, I had asked for a refill of OJ waited 10 minutes and asked again before we got it. The place was not by any means busy. I have been to busier places and had 3x better service. Please step your service game up. I really liked your food but I can't stand crappy service. Your servers are nice but they should pay more attention to their customers."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!!
Went two weeks ago saturday for the first time. Walked in...greeted friendly, sat immediately...after eating I asked for check....waitress told me it was complimentary because of grand opening. Left big tip.
Went today again, Saturday, place is packed, sat at bar, had the Mom Omelet and double bloody Mary, came out super fast, both were fantastic!!!!
As customers came in...all were greeted happily and quickly, owners there greeting and helping out too.
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!! :-) left a big tip."}
{"text":"My husband and just moved in this area and LOVE this place ! Food was outstanding.i ordered some florentine egg benedict dish and I'll be hard pressed to try anything else.great menu"}
{"text":"Food was very good.  The problem is the waitress takes your order then a guy repeatedly comes around to fill your coffee. So basically the waitress is history.  If there's a problem with your order like we had (forgot the pancakes) good luck getting that resolved!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Iowa & WOW !!!!! I had the Gold State Benedict with fresh fruit it was incredible. Fast & friendly service with a smile. I'll be back with my Iowans."}
{"text":"first time here, service was great and friendly Had the no name omlett very large and tasty. thanks we will be going back"}
{"text":"First time here, impressed with food and service. Thank you fir the great customer service and hot food!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed remarkable personal service from the moment we entered this Cafe.  The place was quite busy but, we were seated within 5 minutes.  I have visited The Broken Yolk Cafe in San Diego, CA and was very happy with the quality of the food there.  We were very pleasantly surprised to find the same great tasting food, fair pricing and friendly, pleasant wait staff at this location also. Our breakfast was delivered quickly and prepared perfectly. Visit this spot for an exceptional Breakfast event.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and we unanimously agree that we love it!! Try the Border Benedict and thank me later!"}
{"text":"I was a tourist visiting friends in the Valley for New Year's. We opted to try The Broken Yolk for brunch last Sunday.

It was a stellar meal and an excellent experience. First of all, the place has a real nice vibe from the staff. Our servers were very personable and prompt with orders and food delivery, even though the place was nearly filled to capacity. The food was superb in quality, seasoning, preparation, and presentation. Portions were large - you won't leave hungry!

The menu is extensive. We ordered the eggs Benedict, a Belgian waffle, a \"Mom's\" omelette, Nutella crepes for dessert, coffee, and a tall (!) orange juice.

My friends are very discerning eaters, and they raved. My omelette was to perfection (which shouldn't be surprising since it's their specialty). Undoubtedly the best omelette I've ever had. We tried the Nutella dessert crepes because my friend's birthday had been the prior day... they were decadently rich and tasty. 

There were no disappointments among the items we tried; all of the food we ordered was  absolutely delicious!

Other things that matter to me:

The bathroom I used was spotless, and everything throughout the restaurant was impeccably clean; noise levels and privacy at our table were very relaxing. A very nice guy, who turned out to be the co-owner (with his wife), was going from table to table chatting with newcomers, like us, and their **many** regulars. He wanted to know what we thought of our meal - a good sign of ownership presence and dedication.

In my five years on Yelp, this is only the second review I've bothered to write. The Broken Yolk is a great find!"}
{"text":"Biggest Breakfast I have ever had!!! Service good !     Brunch cocktail fabulous!!! South of the border coffee awesome."}
{"text":"The Broken Yolk has a suuuuuper nice staff...

We have eaten here twice; once with a large group and another time with just the two of us.  We are not big eaters, but I would recommend eating a light meal before going to the Broken Yolk because regardless of what I or anyone I know orders, they leave slightly hungry.  The stuffed french toast was divine, but they are incredibly stingy with their mascarpone cheese filling, to the point where you only get a small hint of how the meal you see pictured on the menu might taste.  On our first visit, 4 of us ordered it and we all left hungry (we are not large people).  The Golden State eggs benedict was delicious as well but again, I left hungry today.

I wasn't too happy that the waters we ordered never came, so I rationed my $3 drop of orange juice and left parched.  The table at which we sat was broken.  One of us had to keep a foot on the leg at all times, otherwise the table would fall to the side and everything would slide off of it (this actually happened as we were leaving).  The tables, by the way, are packed in there like sardines.  We had a baby with us and felt like we were practically hitting people in their heads with our bag and carrier as we were walking to and from our table.  Your \"neighbors\" sit so close to you that any and all conversations can be overheard.  It is so awkward that we just sat there in silence and figured we'd talk later.  Thirty dollars later (for breakfast), we left hungry.  :-(

Again, the food is tasty (but stingy) and the staff is really nice but the atmosphere is too crowded, the portions are too small and the food is too expensive.  We'll probably only be back if someone in our group insists on going again."}
{"text":"We started going to the Broken Yolk four or five days after it opened, and can declare, without exception, that this is our new favorite breakfast place.  The owners are very friendly and will do whatever necessary and go out of their way to make anything right.  I've read some of the negative reviews and believe that these people were probably not at this restaurant at all.  I've tried several menu items, but prefer the John Wayne while my wife likes the Golden State Benedict.  We have our very own table (providing nobody else is sitting there) and Jim (the owner) and I have solved most of the worlds problems.

As far as the prices go, we've been to every restaurant in the area and the Broken Yolk is comparable to, if not cheaper than these other places.

The Broken Yolk is a very nice casual restaurant to go to for good food, with an observant staff who cares about your dining experience.  If they were slow, or got things wrong, it was probably because they had just opened and things like this might  happen to any new business.   I would encourage the people with negative experiences to give them another try.  Jim and his staff will go out of their way to make sure you want to come back.

John and Erlinda"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for about 2 weeks and we've been here 3 times! Food is excellent, staff are great and the owner, Jim is so nice! Happy to have Broken Yolk in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Gave this place three tries. Brought wrong food that I didn't even order and had to wait another twenty mins to get my order. Second and third time the food was cold. Literally my home fries weren't even warm to the touch. Although the service was fine, the cooks need to check there food and get it together. Or hire new cooks."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to this restaurant for the first time today and the hostess  service was horrible! We walked in and were not greeted or even acknowledged...she stared at us like we were inconveniencing her by even being there. 
I then told her how many there were in our party and my name and she still didn't say a word..she just wrote the information down. We didn't even know how long the wait was.
Needless to say we instantly walked out. This is a horrible representation of customer service. I now think negatively of this company because of that encounter.
When you're the first point of contact you should act a certain way and treat people a certain way! We will not be coming back!"}
{"text":"First off this place is amazing. We were there for the soft opening. We did not know it wasn't fully open yet, the amazing owners still invited us in for a fully gratis meal. 

This chain is our favorite breakfast place in San Diego and the wife and myself were stoked they opened the first one in Arizona a mile from our home. 

That all being said, our last three trips in have been a huge disappointed due to our server. I'm not hard to please, and don't normally let subpar service ruin my experience. However, Manda, the gal that took our order on our last three trips, provided no service. 

I say took our order because that was the extent of her service on the last trip in. The time before it literally took get so long to do even that, that we watched people who we're sat after us, with a different server, get their food before we got our drinks.

Today when we left I decided to write a review. We couldn't get her to refill our coffee (someone else brought it out) and after repeated requests for silverware I had to take them from another table. She interacted with us a total of twice. To take our order and drop the check. Everything else was done by other staff. Awesome place, but the next time I am sat in her section I will request an alternate server, or leave."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here all the time. It is our ultimate favorite breakfast/lunch restaurant!!  The staff is always friendly and the service is prompt. The owners make rounds to the tables to see how everything is and they deliver food to tables to greet customers. Our favorite waitresses, Manda and Sarah, always take great care of us. Most importantly, the food is to die for!  My wife's favorite breakfast dish is the Border Benedict - the corn cake is sweet and tender and the carne asada with green sauce are a great combination. The pancakes are large and very fluffy. The fiesta burrito is HUGE (I get it with carne asada) and I have to take some home. The carne asada is some of the best in the valley!! Not only do we recommend this place to all of our friends, we take our out-of-state friends and relatives when they visit. You won't go wrong with anything on the menu here."}
{"text":"The only good thing about breakfast at this place was the server, Kailee (? spelling). The bacon was cold. The biscuits and gravy were edible, but even adding salt and pepper didn't help. The biscuits were very bland. I tried scraping off the gravy to eat this, thinking the gravy was the problem. Nope, that wasn't it. Next I tried just the gravy. If they made the gravy from scratch, they need a new recipe. If their gravy is ready-made they need a different brand. In the positive side, besides the server, the restaurant was very clean inside and out."}
{"text":"We have tried Broken Yolk twice now, and both times the food has been disappointing and bland. They get the orders themselves right, which is awfully nice of them, but the potatoes are tasteless, the Canadian bacon is so salty that it made me gag. My husband's omelette was underdone to the point that the vegetables were raw and the eggs were runny. The food was also expensive for what it is. Definitely about $15/person if you get a platter and a beverage. Just go down Gilbert a mile and go to Black Bear instead, you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Great food and fabulous staff. Portions are big so make sure you ask for a \"to go\" to start with so you're not rolling out of there!"}
{"text":"Almost no wait (Sunday 10 am), fast and friendly staff and best of all, great fresh not overcooked food! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love the Eggs Benedict from this place that I have had many times before.  Today, not sure if it's because it's the day after Thanksgiving, I got food poisoning from this place.  Good food, but don't go after a holiday.    They message me, funny because I ordered food from ubereats.  This is the message they sent to me.  
Hi Kristina,

My name is Jennifer, I am the co-owner of the Broken Yolk Cafe. I brought you your silverware today and recognized you and your guest. So sorry you are not feeling well! We serve our food fresh everday, eggs, sauces, etc. Please next time you are in ask for me and I will take care of you and your guest, or if you prefer we can send you out a gift card for you and a guest to use at any of our locations. In good faith we would ask you remove your post from yelp."}
{"text":"My mom and I just had breakfast for the first time here. She had The American and I did the pumpkin spice pancakes with a side of sausage and hash browns. We both left feeling full and very happy with the food and still had quite a bit left over! The staff and management here was stellar and the food was fresh and delicious. We will definitely be back, beats other famous chain breakfast spots! Also, they have a rewards card!"}
{"text":"A little pricey, service was a little slow even with only about 5-6 other tables. They got my wifes order wrong but they quickly correct it. She ordered the \"No-Name\" omelette and she enjoyed it. She said that she would order it again if we came back. I had biscuit and gravy w/sausage. Strangest looking biscuit I've ever seen. At first we seriously thought it was a hamburger bun but it was not. It tasted sort of ok. It came with 2 little \"Farmer John\" style sausage links and very few potatos, not impressed. Served with very little gravy so the biscuit was very dry. I had to order extra gravy just to make it a true biscuit & gravy. Again, I was not impressed. Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"We loved this place. We go to SD often but had never been to a this restaurant.  I ordered the basic bacon and egg breakfast, YUMM, big portions.  My husband ordered the buttermilk pancakes, GOOD!  We always try the basic breakfast at a new place. I can imagine the other dishes are also good.  We will definately go back."}
{"text":"After hearing numerous people rave about this place, I was excited to try this place. So I met my best friend for breakfast on a Friday morning. It wasn't busy, but I waited in the lobby for a hostess (or even some sort of acknowledgment) by was ignored for quite a while. From what I witnessed, they tend to cater to the regulars there as people just walked past me and sat down while waving hi to the waitress. 

I finally got seated while waiting for my friend and was served coffee right away...and that's pretty much the only cup I got after several requests for refills and even the waitress saying she was coming back with refills (which she didn't until we were finished with our meal). There was a manager serving coffee left and right, but only to the table of regulars. 

The food was okay at best, more like an over-priced Denny's and it was lukewarm and bland. I'm really disappointed after hearing such good things about this place. I think I'll stick with my other breakfast places and won't be back."}
{"text":"This is now a new favorite for breakfast!! The food is oh so yummy, I had the eggs Benedict one day and the tiki toast another day and both were great! Our waitress Sarah was phenomenal! She had such a bubbly personality and was a great addition to our breakfast! One of the days we were here the owner came by and chatted with us for while too. Very impressed."}
{"text":"Been here several times, and I'm never disappointed. Their ingredients are fresh. The vegetables taste like they're fresh not frozen. The eggs taste freshly cracked not like the processed eggs from the carton that most restaurants use. Even the coffee is good and strong! I've had different servers each time and each has been friendly and attentive. The managers come by each visit to check in too."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast find, everything was perfect. Have the border Benedict.  Outstanding.  Excellent bloody Mary!"}
{"text":"There's a reason this place is #1 on yelp. The food and drinks are AMAZING! I had the fiesta burrito and it was so so good."}
{"text":"I love this place! I visited for breakfast with friends from out of town. When we arrived the manager opened the door for us and greeted us and was extremely welcoming. We were seated and our server promptly came over to take our drink orders and make recommendations. Her name is Manda ( Just Manda ). And she is one of the most delightful people I have met in a long time. The food was on the table promptly. The quality, appearance, and taste far exceeded my expectations. My out-of-town friends so enjoyed breakfast that we went back the following morning. Our first experience was no fluke. Upon arrival we were treated like family and again the great food was almost unbelievable. Luckily Manda was there that day too. The Broken Yolk has great food and atmosphere and I just love Manda!"}
{"text":"Came back 6 months latter.  Not much has changed.  Still way over priced for the area and way to much in the way of Mexican breakfast foods in an area with a HEAVY midwestern snowbird retiree population.   Was hoping things would have improved, but sadly that is not the case.  Again, food was just warm, so that within a very few minutes I was eating cold \"Tiki Toast\"."}
{"text":"Server was extremely pleasant and efficient, but the food was lame.  My toast was cold and my omelet was barely warm.  Server took care of both problems, but for the price, it was unacceptable.  I will not return.  The coffee was horrible also."}
{"text":"What a wonderful find!!! We came here for breakfast before heading down to Tucson for the day. The food was great and the service staff were very friendly. When we were ready to leave from  Tucson my, husband realized he had left the wallet with his I D and credit cards there at Broken Yolk. They closed at 3 so no one answered when we called. He got up early and called them at 7, and sure enough, they had his wallet and cards. When we returned for breakfast there again, he talked to the owner- manager and expressed his appreciation. She declined to take a tip to pass on the the server Ruby who found the wallet saying all her workers were like that. You can be sure we will come back when in Mesa for the excellent food and kind service. They have a flight of Mimosas that looked spectacular."}
{"text":"The staff at the Broken Yolk Cafe is amazing! They were on top of everything. We couldn't ask for better service especially of how busy they all were. Kudos to the entire staff you guys are amazing! The reason for the 3 star review is the food. I got the biscuits and gravy and it was ok. Nothing special for me. Everyone has different opinions when it comes to food, so someone else may love the food! Defiantly give The Broken Yolk Cafe a shot! The service and staff here is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for breakfast with my family when I was in town and I was disappointed. I looked up good breakfast locations in the area and decided on this place because of the good reviews. I am not sure if it was an off day, but based on my experience I probably wouldn't recommend this restaurant or return again. 

The service was terrible. Our waitress was mostly not attentive. My coffee cup was dry for most of our meal. I ordered the California Breakfast Burrito, which is one of their recommended items. It was so bland even with the pico they give you. I had to add a lot of salt, which I've never had to do before at other restaurants. You can get a breakfast burrito from Filibertos that is 10x better for less than half the price. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this venue in Southern California! We were not disappointed by our gem here in Mesa! Six of us this morning..... Service by Amanda was brisk even though the restaurant was packed! We were greeted warmly and seated almost instantly! Our group included a couple of vegetarians and their requests for diversity were graciously accommodated! Owner Jim was engaging and spent time with us! All of our meals arrived as ordered and were simply delicious! Bloody Marys and Mimosas were a huge hit! One in our party asked the owner to consider offering gin for Bloody Marys in addition to vodka... Jim assured us gin would be available on our next visit! With the variety offered on the menu, our group is considering making a habit of dining here on Sundays! So grateful we have another quality dining venue in Mesa!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, crowded on week-ends, plan to wait.  Really good burger there too.  Last visit, waitress kept coming back tell us our order would be up soon.  Great to have that kind of service.  After she brought our food she came back a couple times to make sure everything was A-OK.  Would recommend this place to anyone, local or visitor."}
{"text":"Very poorly organization. Bad,slow service and the quality was not the greatest. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is the third time in less than a week that we have eaten at the Broken Yolk. The food and service has always been top of the line. Our second visit we were a party of nine. We received the same fast friendly service like we received when we were a party of two. Our server Juli was friendly and  prompt keeping our drinks filled. :) The owners Jim and Jennifer are always around to offer friendly smiles and heartfelt friendship. They treat you like family. If you haven't eaten here you must give this place a try. Plenty of parking. They can handle large parties. They don't have call ahead seating but for large parties of 10 or more please call."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! It is definitely not like every other breakfast place! It's fast and good and the food always looks epic when it comes out! They messed up my order once but it happens! I have still gone back many times! Loveee it!"}
{"text":"Worth the 30 minute wait! The food was cooked perfect. Everyone loved what they ordered. Salsa was tasty, biscuits and gravy were amazing, steak was cooked perfect, chicken and waffles A+. Also must try the pomegranate mimosas!"}
{"text":"We really liked this breakfast place!  Great service and a really nice selection on the menu. I especially liked that you can add two eggs and bacon to any dish for $2.95 - so I had protein with my waffle!!  My brother had a huge and delicious omelette and Sis had Tiki French toast which she really enjoyed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. If you like big portions?? this is the place. The omelets are the size of a football. I have tried about 10 different things on the menu and all of been great.
Good service!!
Always check Groupons for the coupon."}
{"text":"Holy cow new favorite breakfast spot. They have everything. Best eggs benedict I've ever had. Comfortable, great service and their bacon is cooked to perfection. Come eat here. Just do it."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice now and loved it both times! Sweet potato pancakes are delicious and the omelet I had with spinach,asparagus and bacon was outstanding! Sorry for those with bad experiences but that certainly hasn't been the case the times I ate there. Owner visited with us and service was prompt. Food was great and would highly recommend!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was good. Prices are a little high, and the place is a little loud for a breakfast on a Saturday morning."}
{"text":"Busy place \"Sunday\" after church. We ordered only two entrée's for the three of us I wasn't that hungry good thing I didn't order. The Manchaca plate look good on the menu but we prefer our meals hot not luke warm or boarder line cold. Ask for replacement or refire Manchaca meal this time HOT. We got our meal and it was hot hopefully it was a new meal and not just microwaved. We ask for corn tortillas on our first order which we did not get and we didn't get on our refire and even the salsa. Training for all staff may be in order when they're slammed. Asked for iced refill, didn't get it either."}
{"text":"My wife and I have watched as several breakfast restaurants in that location have shut down, so we weren't that hopeful that this restaurant would survive. It seems as if it's not only surviving now, but thriving. We had a coupon, so we decided to give it a try. The food there is excellent, but the most amazing thing is the portion size. Huge omelets with lots of potatoes. The fresh fruit on the side was a generous portion of grapes, cantaloupe and pineapple. My wife had the waffle sandwich and loved it. The server was polite and efficient. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The staff was harm and welcoming. The food was excellent and came out to our table very quickly.  This is the only place that has ever cooked my bacon the way I like it (very soft). I will be recommending this place for sure. Also it is basically just off the 60 so I can just just pop right back to my work after a quick lunch too. Their hours are great too. I'm totally a late brunch person on the weekends."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a good breakfast spot in Mesa.  My husband and I went there for brunch yesterday and it was wonderful.  The service was friendly and quick.  The apple juice and orange juice is hand pressed/squeezed and to die for.  I had the Nutella crepes with bananas and apple wood bacon on the side and the portions were perfect and the food was delicious.  They offer a rewards program and throw in fifty points just for joining.  The only reason this isn't a five is that the juice is pretty expensive and although it says a Large, it comes in a tall skinny champagne type of glass so it didn't feel like it was a large.  Other than that it was amazing.  We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Very unhappy about my visit.  

Prices way out of line for the location...

My order was served by the BUSBOY....after he finished cleaning off tables.  

Coffee at $2.75 a cup was a joke...

ordered a waffle and it came with butter that was too hard to spread...

Would I tell anyone to go there? NO way."}
{"text":"Nice selection on the menu but prices are on the upscale side.  I had the SBA omelet which was a typical overcooked omelet with a remarkably tasteless filling.  Ordered the home fries which were thin slices of potato which had apparently been marinated in oil and then passed quickly over the cooktop.  I had to use my knife to cut them.  The blueberry muffin was better than Costco but had to ask for butter.  Also had to ask for enough silverware set ups for the table of three.  Husband had the eggs florentine which were a take on eggs benedict but he wasn't impressed with the sauce.  Iced tea was acceptable but no refill was offered.  Water came in very small glasses, one of which had to be sent back for cleanliness issues.  Why would you skimp on the size of the water glass when you're charging those prices?  Waitress dropped off check before we even got the butter but almost had to be tripped to get her to take the payment folder.  (Place was not that busy.)  I probably will not bother going back since there are many places with better values and quality in the valley.  3 stars is generous."}
{"text":"Really looked forward to trying this place out.  Unfortunately didn't get to try the food, or even a drink!  15 minutes at our table and not even an acknowledgement from a waitress or waiter.  I'd be willing to let it slide, had they even seemed busy.  Having a toddler and a pregnant wife with me would give the staff some urgency.... You'd think."}
{"text":"The mimosa flight was light and refreshing. The Border Benedict had a generous portion of carne asada, but the corn cakes and green sauce had a weird flavor.

We had to stare down a server to get service; but after that, service was fast. Initially, they forgot to bring my companion's hash browns.

We've been here before and loved it. So, despite not being impressed on this visit, we will be back."}
{"text":"This is our first visit here to broken yolk. According to the reviews and the line outside I was judging this resteraunt to be pretty good. 

After waiting 40 minutes and watching the new people come in a get sat before us we learned that they skipped our name even though we were sitting right in front of them. It didn't not bother me as much as it bothered my wife but nonetheless we order our food. When we received our food I could smell the yeast in the pancakes and my biscuit had a stale taste of whatever ingredients they are using in their bread. 

Hawaiian French toast and eggs were good. 

Service was very minimum but descent."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Took forever to get seated and once we did there was no silverware, no creamer for our coffee and the waitress took about 20min to acknowledge us. Never bothered to ask if we were ready to order just kept passing by...I had to call for her in order to get her to help us even though she was our waitress!!! Never coming back here again!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday breakfast and had reservations. The wait staff we had was very slow, took longer and longer to get refills on coffee and drinks. I had ordered the Border Benedict with home fries. The egg itself was cooked great and the flavor was amazing. The home fries however were barely cooked through and had no flavor. It was a good place to grab some breakfast but if you have a better spot that you like, start heading there."}
{"text":"This is a great and popular breakfast spot located at Gilbert and Southern.  My favorite dish there is the Border Benedict which includes Two poached eggs and seasoned carne asada on top of two sweet corn cakes, smothered in homemade poblano sauce.  Careful though, the jalapenos they put on top aren't for the faint of heart, they pack some heat!  Even fully packed our wait isn't very long to get seated. Only area of improvement could be their bus service as both our table and one across the way hadn't been cleaned below.  We also signed up for their rewards program and looking forward to earning points.  They have plenty of TV's and we were able to catch some of the Summer Olympics!"}
{"text":"Nice local place. Pretty busy. I like how creative the menu is and some of the items in there. Big portions but I wasn't blown away by the food, could just be what I ordered. My friends i was with had the same to say. Would tell people to give it a try."}
{"text":"Went sunday around 11am....minimal wait time....food came out in a very reasonable time and was extremely tasty.  Out table tried the tiki french toast, golden benedict, and very fluffy pancakes with really good bacon....overall excellent tasting food....wait staff, sarah s, was attentive and friendly.  Great place and would be back in a heartbeat...."}
{"text":"This place is good for breakfast and brunch. The portions are big and the food is good, but not great. The prices are a little pricey though... I paid about $10 ($9something) for a \"Tiki Toast\" which is Hawaiian bread french toast. It was good, but not $10 good. The crowd is mostly older people inside. My waitress was very nice. I would recommend this place to other people."}
{"text":"I adore this place! The food is amazing, the border Benedict is always perfect and delicious. The last time we went we got a flight of mimosas, not realizing how large they would be and for under $10! They were so good that I forgot to take a photo of my meal so I only have a picture before we started drinking. Service can be a bit slow when they are busy but it does not deduct from how great this place is!"}
{"text":"The biscuits and gravy were disgusting the gravy was alright but the biscuit and sausage were so dry!!! Our waitress was nice and the French fries were good"}
{"text":"Such good food! We have ordered to go before and really enjoyed it, so we decided to stop in! Excellent quality food at a decent price. Large portions enough to share and wide variety of selection on the menu. Lots of servers so service is quick and efficient. Definitely great family breakfast or lunch spot, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in Mesa!! I get the French toast breakfast and there is PLENTY to eat, my husband loves the breakfast burritos and has a hard time finishing them! 

I will say my one simple complaint is that I got an omelet before and it was too cheesy. I'm normally fine with the amount of cheese but I could have used less."}
{"text":"I have come here now a few times. The food is good. The service was good. All around great place for breakfast. Generous portions."}
{"text":"First time there and not sure will return.  First the service was a little slow. Finally got our coffee. I am on a search for the best biscuits & gravy and these were not even close. I have never had sausage (white) gravy made with a chicken base. The flavor was way off not to mention there was only a minimal amount \"something\" in the gravy besides chicken flavoring. Looked hard for sausage or bacon or Anything to take the chicken flavor away. VERY DISAPPOINTED. One of the other people at the table with us tried the B&G and did not like them either. Hubby said his breakfast was good so I have to guess they were having a off-day."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food portions are huge and the service was quick.  I ordered the border Benedict and it was exactly what I was hoping for! My stepsons ordered the French toast and the chicken fried steak. They are both picky eaters, And they both loved their meals. The only reason why I gave this place 4 stars, is because the decor looks pretty dated. I was leery when we first walked in because it reminded me of a Denny's or a village inn, but the food really impressed us! They even gave us a complimentary crepe  for mine and my stepson's birthday. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Surprised that this place didn't have more reviews 
Great big portions bacon eggs cooked to perfection. Giant toast! Also fun drinks for the am drinker
Far better then the usual breakfast chains"}
{"text":"Amazing food and huge servings.  Also impeccable service and I love the comfortable atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pancakes, eggs and eggs florentine. I had high hopes as the San Diego location does well. They should have brought their chef out because what we received was Hollandaise sauce broken and over salted. Rubber pancakes it would take a sawzall to cut through and the over easy eggs. Well those were ok.  Ordered fruit with my meal. Never got it. Service?  Yep once the server noticed we hadn't been served they came over  nothing exceptional and the coffee was fairly weak. Overpriced for what was served. Disappointed. I won't be back. Suggestions get a chef who knows what they are doing."}
{"text":"I have being wanting to give this place a try for a while and was finally able to go on a Saturday morning. 

First off we waited about 10 minutes while seated before anyone came to take our drink order. We tried the OJ which was good, but not worth the almost $7 for a half carafe. The service once it arrived was good though. 

The food- Two meals were ordered. 

The Mom omelet: This was ordered with hash browns and an English muffin. When brought out the omelet was missing the salsa that was supposed to top it. However, they did bring me some after I questioned it. The hash browns were not salted which was disappointing that they missed such a basic thing. After I added my own salt they were good, but nothing special. The omelet was OK, I didn't realize this omelet had no cheese, otherwise I would have added it. That was my mistake. The serving size was large, but the filling inside was over powered by a lot of onions, partially cooked. The English muffin was fine, but again nothing special. 

The Border Benedict: This was ordered with home fries, again they were not salted. After adding salt they were again OK but nothing special. The benedict itself was flavorful, the green sauce was yummy but the meat was a bit over cooked and chewy. 

I probably won't return as I feel I can get much better breakfast elsewhere and cheaper."}
{"text":"The food looks pretty good. The plate that the fiesta burrito came on was dirty. The place smells like an old building. The menus need to be wiped down. The portions are huge. You will need a to go box. Other than that the food was par for the course. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Was there for the first time yesterday and I was blown away. Great variety of menu, large portions for a reasonable price, and ingredient options on omelettes you will not see anywhere in the valley. And they have a rewards program which is always a plus. I'll be hitting this place at least once a month!!"}
{"text":"COME HUNGRY!

I ordered the American Breakfast, which is two eggs that comes with two choices of potatoes or fruit as well as a meat of choice, and toast, biscuit or a muffin. I ordered my eggs sunny side up with corned beef hash and a biscuit.

I am not a huge fan of corn beef, but something was telling me to change my original order from bacon to corned beef. I'm glad I did, it was the best I've ever had.  My eggs were pretty standard and the home fries were actually scalloped potatoes and pretty good. I also had a biscuit.  

My family ordered dishes like an omelette, french toast, a waffle and the tiki toast. I didn't try any of theirs but it really looked good.  The portions are pretty big, so if you don't have much of an appetite you could share!"}
{"text":"Love this new spot in Mesa. Food selection is awesome, staff is friendly, and coffee keeps coming! Check out this place, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast / lunch place . Breakfast  was excellent.  Tyler our server  was on top of his game. 
Accommodated all our needs down to switching   out the fruit our grad daughter did not like to strawberries  and bananas."}
{"text":"My daughter and I dined her for breakfast last weekend. We came on a Sunday morning, so we expected a wait. We did wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad because they were moving pretty quick in there. Our first choice had an hour wait, which is what forced us to try this new place! I'm glad we did. 

The decor could be spruced up a bit. It kind of felt like an old diner that needed a deep cleaning and a re-fresh. With that being said, it did have a warm and comfortable atmosphere. 

Service was great. Everyone was friendly and prompt. I had a hot cup of coffee within a couple of minutes of sitting down. And we came here because my daughter wanted Gluten Free pancakes (harder to find than you'd think). The pancakes were delicious! I ordered a standard American breakfast and it was good. Nothing crazy, but nice. 

If you are looking for a relaxed, cozy, simple but yummy breakfast, without any bells and whistles, this place is it. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I know its a quirky breakfast place and i have been enjoying their breakfasts for years but try the hamburgers they are some of the best in the valley."}
{"text":"First time here, saw reviews and pictures and have been searching for a place that has legitimately good biscuits and gravy...according to my fiancée it truly is biscuits and gravy here and he is so excited we finally found a place to serve what he's been searching for. So many great options here and luckily we came by after the early morning breakfast rush so we had no wait and the service was timely. Great first experience!"}
{"text":"Food great! Service not so good I'll only be back for food needs to work on service prebussing refills and check backs"}
{"text":"Awful... the quality was gross!
The vegetables in my omelette were frozen, the \"home fries\" were mushy, resembling mashed potatoes. The blueberry muffin tasted like something I would buy at Circle K.
Yah, the portions are huge, but if the food is terrible, who cares how much you get, I left it on my plate! Don't think I even want to try lunch here...."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant!! Highly recommended! Diverse menu, with something for every taste. The breakfast burrito I got this time had a southwestern flare and was outstanding, and so big, I was able to make 3 meals out of it! Fresh ingredients, friendly & attentive staff, been many times & it's consistently great. Shout out to Krystal & Brad for their excellent service!! Also, the owners, who are super cool, take time to greet the customers. You don't see that everyday! This is definitely my favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"So excited for this new place.  Both the Border Benedict and Mimosa were amazing.  Staff was super friendly, looking forward to coming back and trying more items."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I waited 40 Mins on a Sunday which is expected but I was disappointed in the food. I got a turkey wrap with fries and it was just OK..not impressed."}
{"text":"The service was quick and friendly. So quick I think I missed the guy bring out the sausage link that must have fell off the plate... great service overall. The food ... I had the border Benedict and I was in my glory. So delicious. My girlfriend had the Nutella crepes and they were not like your usual crepes you get at other chains... these were like homemade crepes that compared to the ones my grandmother would make. Definitely try it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Sorry to say After reading the reviews I expected this place to be Awesome different It was a little disappointing! It was like going to DENNYS all the same (generic) nothing to rave about!!
Maybe it was an off day for the chef :/ I like to give a place 3 changes (give them the Benefit of the doubt) will try again I hope it's better next time around!! 
I had Chorizo and eggs (IT WAS JUST LIKE I MAKE THEM AT HOME) NO WOW FACTOR NO SPECTACULAR FLAVOR simple it was disappointing waffles same!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Broken Yolk Cafe for breakfast, ordered the Fiesta breakfast burrito.  I was disappointed with the meal, it was very bland.  It was supposed to have seasoned meat in it, the meat was tasteless, as were the eggs, veggies and cheese in it.  The manager walked by and asked how we liked out meal, I told him how I felt about it, and he didn't offer a discount or anything...just took the plate.  I will go back and try something else, as my husband got the crepes and loved them.  For now the jury is out on this one.  I also found them pricey for breakfast compared to other breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"Always quick to serve, quick to seat (never less than 10 min wait), Hot tastey food with great people. JULIE is our fav server. Sooo friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"First time in today and I have got to say this is one of the BEST burritos I have ever eaten. I think it was called the fuego? I'm vegetarian so I did no meat add potatoes and jalapenos and it was amazing. Service was okay, nothing to write home about but nothing to complain. The only thing that was bad about my visit was the bathrooms. They looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a long time, the kind of toilets you really don't want to sit down on. They need some serious LOVE, and I can't help but judge the rest of the cleanliness off of the bathroom. I hope I'm wrong, either way, this burrito will have me coming back."}
{"text":"I think this place switched owners. Any way I don't mind paying $13.00 for breakfast if I am on vacation at a nice resort but for eggs, Bacon, & potatoes at a place on Gilbert rd & Southern is insane.  I ordered chicken & waffles & it was SO  bland. Our food was cold.  the service was extremely slow. There's nothing worse than sitting there waiting to order & waiting to get your bill. We won't be back."}
{"text":"We love this place, best breakfast in town. The California omelette is the best. Service is great and everyone is so nice
We will be going back real soon!!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! My husband and I went here for brunch after church on Sunday! I got an omelette and he had one of the Benedicts! Both were delicious with large portions! The hash browns were great and so was the blueberry muffin! We will be back."}
{"text":"We were so excited to go here as many have said how goos it is. No thank you. If you want canned (Hormel) chili on your omelet or box Spanish rice, this is your place. 
I ordered the chilaquiles with rice and beans. The beans were pretty good but the rice was clearly from a box mix with corn, peas, and string beans in it. Yuck. I asked for red and green sauce on top and they mixed into a tomatillo-based, acidic sauce with zero spice. I asked for a side of green sauce (chili right?) and it was so bitter with no spice, I couldn't even eat it. I cook my own Mexican food from scratch but had hoped at least they open a jar of decent salsa or enchilada sauce for this. Such gross flavor.
My husband had the John Wayne omelet as he loves homemade chili. Much to his surprise, the omelet was over cooked and the chili was Hormel right out of the can. We aren't even sure they heated it up but just plopped it right from the can.
I didn't even eat more than 3 bites of my breakfast and the waitress never asked us one time how we liked our food. She was so busy juggling many tables by herself, we barely saw her. I boxed up a little of my food but left quite a giant portion on my plate. She took away my plate and gave us the bill without even asking a single question.
When we got home, I tried to eat my leftovers for lunch but it was so disgusting, I threw it out.
Sadly, we will not be back."}
{"text":"We love trying out new restaurants! It took us a little bit of time to finally get over to the Broken Yolk Cafe as we have a new little one. This place was just average.... Disappointed after knowing it came from Southern California. The food was fine but nothing spectacular, we had the fiesta burrito and traditional eggs Benedict. With the prices it would have needed to be just a little bit more wonderful than average. My husband had a coffee which they tried to fill every 2 minutes. I had a water which I could only get refilled if I asked. I made my husband get a water just so I could drink the mini glass.

For the price I would recommend hitting up biscuits or liberty market. We likely won't go back."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times now and here's what I have to say. 

The food is always hot and delicious. 
The menu is packed with so many options, that deciding what to get is always the hardest part!
The coffee is great, and the servers keep it coming! 
And the service... I think everyone who works there is amazing, happy, pleasant, cheerful. 
I've never had a bad experience and I'm so happy this place exists... 
Highly recommend the Border Benedict - Two poached eggs and seasoned carne asada on top of two sweet corn cakes, smothered in our homemade poblano sauce. Served with homefries, hashbrowns, fresh fruit, beans or Mexican rice. 
omnomnom!"}
{"text":"First off this place rocks some rockin tunes ......,,, and the music is not to loud ...... The breakfast are the bomb service is excellent"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning and had a great experience, food was fantastic. Easy to find location with very large parking lot. There were 3 of us and we arrived just before 9am and we were seated immediately with no wait in a booth. The restaurant is very clean and bright and our waitress was incredibly friendly and helped us decide on what to order. I ordered the Mom Omelette minus the alfalfa sprouts, my friend ordered the border check omelette and my son had the Nutella with banana and strawberry crepes. The Mom omelette was filled with fresh veggies (green peppers, onions and mushrooms) and a very small drizzle of sour cream-definitely could have used more. The border check omelette was very flavorful and the chorizo was well cooked with little grease. My sons crepes looked delicious and he said they were very good. I had a biscuit with my omelette and I will say this was hands down the best biscuit I have ever had. It was very thick and soft and just amazing. I ordered a side of sausage gravy but it was a very thick gravy. It tasted very good but just a little too thick for my preference and the biscuit didn't need anything besides butter, it was delicious. I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we tried this place for breakfast. On a Sunday morning at 9:00am, we were able to find a table for 6 with no wait. 10 min later the restaurant was absolutely full and there were no tables available and people were waiting in line. Despite the place being absolutely packed, the service was very good. Our server made sure she checked if we needed more coffee or drinks while we waited for our food. We ordered many different dishes of the menu and requested slight changes to them, this did not slow down the service nor did any thing come out incorrect. The food was delicious!! Every dish that came to the table was done perfectly. Portion was quite big but it was so good we were able to finish our plates. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food and the portion size. I am so pleased with this place I cannot wait for the next time we're off and can go there for breakfast! Would love to try other menu options next time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Wow...what a great find!  They have a great menu, the food is excellent (try the SBA omelet), portions are HUGE, and prices are reasonable.  Once again, thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"This place is about on par with Denny's. I had some delicious tacos. They have booze for breakfast. It's not a bad choice for breakfast. It's affordable. There are fancier and more creative places out there for breakfast, but sometimes that isn't what you want! This diner style place hit the spot on the day I went. AND, like I said, I had tacos . . . for breakfast. So it's not all eggs and pancakes. Everyone can be happy with the choices available here."}
{"text":"I've opted to come back as there is no decent breakfast places imho around my home. The service appears to be slow to deliver your food once ordered, that's quickly rebuffed once the entrée arrives - they are huge! Coffee is decent. You should arrive with your stomach empty, or perhaps share with your loved one."}
{"text":"I just had the greatest breakfast here!  The staff is great and the food is AMAZING!  Love the hash-browns and they are crispy!!!  I recommend the Border Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"This is nothing like The restaurant from San Diego. I ordered the Carne Asada street tacos. Hot Plate and cold food. If I wanted left overs. I would have stayed home."}
{"text":"We had breakfast/lunch here and it was hands down one of my favorite restaurants I've eaten in. The owner and his wife greeted us at the door, the food was amazing and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"First timer here. Place is nice but I definitely think it's overpriced. I ordered a California breakfast burro , a coffee and orange juice. Altogether costed 20 bucks. I'd at least expect a really good burro for that price but it was super basic and not much flavor. 98% of the burro was egg and one side had the bacon and hash. 
 If I would've known I'd be charged that much I would've gone to Los favoritos for a breakfast burro. Might give it a second shot but most likely will skip this place."}
{"text":"I love their iced caramel coffee! We went to the one in San Diego and were pleasantly surprised to find one right here in Mesa. It is pretty hidden in my opinion and I honestly would've never noticed it here if we hadn't gone to the one in San Diego and known what it was about. Food is good, well priced, and service is pretty quick overall. Big menu to choose from too"}
{"text":"Came from Vacaville, Ca, great food and Brooks is a great waiter. Recommend to go there"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Broken Yolk for a while now. It is close to our business...So this am we finally did! About a 15min wait to be seated so not bad & true to their quote.  After a few minutes a server took our drink order and another our food. We ordered the tiki french toast which was very good! Also ordered the nutella & banana crepes which again was delicious! Our hashbrowns we ordered crispy and they were not. So we asked for them to be remade but again came out soggy. All in all it was worth the trip! We will be back! The only complaint....As a business owner myself a smile goes along way for our customers. Their servers could use their Smile more."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and decided to try this place due to good reviews. Unfortunately the only thing that deserves a star is the tiki toast which was good. The Benedict came with very underpoached eggs and way too much hollandaise. My food was swimming in it which made it inedible. The coffee was very bitter and tasted burnt. Hopefully it was just a bad batch. The food is ok but not good enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, and have liked it immensely. One of my favorite breakfast places. Good portions and full of flavor! The pumpkin pancakes are sooo good!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Go there atlesst twice a week. I recommend you try um out. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"So glad they finally came to Arizona!! My absolute favorite breakfast spot in Southern California, and even better food and prices here in Gilbert!  love love love!! I ussually order the stuffed french toast with strawberries  (instead of bananas) and i have been dreaming of getting my next fix.... now i can! I highly recommend to all my friends and family!!  :)"}
{"text":"Hi all, I visited this location yesterday and the establishment is very nice the staff is very attentive, the (1) owner came over to my table and had a conversation  with me.  Sooooo I wish I could say the same about the food, this has got to be one of my most regrettable reviews because I like the place, but I  just wouldn't go back for the food, personal opinion is that the food is rushed out to the table.

I would rather wait for a late good meal than a hurried undone meal so I  can complain.

My advice is...please talk to your cooks, I think with the corrections your establishment would be great."}
{"text":"Well yes its Saturday!!!! We stopped in to eat breakfast as usual .  Not super hungry so we shared a skillet.
I highly recommend trying each one or order a make your own.  Thats what we do. Scrambled eggs,  sausage,bacon, topped with gravy!! Omg soo good!!! If only grits were on the menu!!! Good ole southern breakfast fare, reminds me of home.
I hoped everyone enjoyed the pink lemonade cupcakes!!!!! 
As always Manda was a professional.. we love to chat and joke around with her. She has a great sense of humor!!  Thanks Rob for chatting with us!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! Great service and great food! I also met the owners Jim and Jen and they were the awesome! So sweet and so kind. If you haven't you need to go check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Food was outstanding! Service was good. I am visiting and Broke Yolk Cafe came highly recommended. They were so right! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast on this side of town.  Everything I've ordered over the last few months has been exceptional.  Great quality meats.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been to a few locations in California so when I saw they opened around corner from me I was excited. The staff was full of smiles and looked like they really were enjoying their day. We didnt have to wait long for service. Our Waitress was amazing, knowledgeable and super nice. It was my mother and I and we also wanted to place a to-go order. She timed it great. The food was perfectly cooked. I got the Tiki Toast minus strawberries due to an allergy to them. My mom got the American Breakfast with Corned Beef Hash. The eggs were scrambled, light and fluffy. The Tiki Toast wasn't too crunchy over done nor was it a soggy mess. It was the perfect balance between a crunchy coating and the yummy soft inside. The to-go order was Biscuits and Gravy. That biscut was the size of a softball. Great staff, great food, definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, underwhelming food. Ordered the chilaquiles with red sauce and it tasted like tomato paste. Food was pretty bland. The service however was awesome.  Staff was friendly and did their job without being too overbearing."}
{"text":"The food here is okay. Nothing special really... But it's not bad either. Pricing isn't too bad as well. The staff are super nice and the setting feels like another Denny's but very clean. I believe they are fairly new to the area and convenient from where I live. They are in front of the target. The eggs were a little too gooey for me but everything else tasted fine. All in all not a bad spot to go eat, and it has a very upbeat vibe."}
{"text":"Me and my fiancé recently moved to Arizona from California and we were so stoked to find that our favorite breakfast place isn't too far away from us. The broken yolk has always been amazing and we loved our location in Temecula our go to is the Golden state benedict and a Bloody Mary. I gotta say the only disappointment was the Bloody Mary it didn't taste the same but other than that the service was great and the food was even better! We will definitely be here again.

I'd also like to add that the owner messaged me and clarified that the reason they tasted different was because they use a different alcohol mix which is understandable. I seriously love this place and would recommend it to anyone and I appreciate that they reached out to explain the difference. Good business owners who you can tell care about their guest. Thank you :) And for that I give them 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Friendly reception at hostess stand and fast seating despite the Sunday brunch crowd. Manager offered us coffee on the house because we were at the table for 10 minutes without having been greeted by our server. Another manager came by after a while and asked if she could take our order or if we just wanted to wait on our server (why would that even be a consideration?). 

My food was okay - comparable to IHOP. My friend asked for well done hash browns - they were turned inside out, so the part that might have been crispy at one point was being steamed, making them mushy and there was barely any meat in her omelette. Had to flag down a server for coffee after being there half an hour. And then they charged us for the coffee anyways. 

Overall, I'm just really disappointed I picked this place. I'm fine with an okay breakfast food at a chain restaurant. It's kind of expected, but the customer service needs a lot of work. A manager should have taken the table over or sent a server over immediately. And realistically during peak hours, somebody should be walking the room every 10 minutes for basic refills (water, coffee, etc). I've worked breakfast before, I know it can be crazy but these are not fast turning tables and it is not a very large restaurant. A little bummed out because it's so close to home. 

Trying to decide if it was just a bad day or if I should try it again. Don't think my friend will come with me."}
{"text":"Super shocked!  This food was really good.  Service was nice and efficient.  They were swamped when we arrived.  They said 30 minute wait, we said ok.  It was like 10 minutes and drinks arrived quickly.  Our order was exactly as requested and tasted great.  Can't really ask for more than that from a breakfast place.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This will absolutely be the last time i eat here.  

Ordered an omelette first attempt my plate was covered in water.  I'm not paying for watery food!!!!! 
Second attempt was still watery just not as bad.

What in the world are they doing in the kitchen?
Seriously, why is my plate full of water to the point it has soaked my hashbrowns the i ordered extra crispy?

I suggest if you do not want water with you omelette go somewhere else.  I know i will be from now on."}
{"text":"Nutella strawberry crepes, corned beef hash and a huge assortment of Southwestern themed breakfast and lunch items. HUGE portions, adult beverages. I had a summer sangria that was quite tasty. Love this place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a terrific place to eat, this is the spot! Not only is the food awesome, but the service is great..highly recommend the Broken Yolk.."}
{"text":"Very good food, only reason for four stars is price as I feel they are a little over priced.  Clean restaurant, staff crazy busy but still took our order in a timely fashion and very friendly.  My boyfriend's coffee was kept full, and our food came out in a reasonable time.  Fresh ingredients and piping hot.

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The Nutella Crepes were amazingly delicious! Definitely going back. Also the BLT was yummy. 
Very clean place and the server was fast, happy with great customer service.  very happy with their service over all."}
{"text":"Love   Manda too and Bryan (with a Y)!! Best service and food.. Also great place to hold a meeting in the back room!!"}
{"text":"Typical breakfast join with an upscale friendly service. Better way to handle their seating list and waiting time. 
Promptly service from your server. Good selection in the menu and good healthy choices with plenty options. Super clean areas. Food has good taste. Maybe natural fresh ingredients???, i don't know. I didn't pick in the kitchen. But all I can tell. This place is highly recommended from me. A super high critic in places. Good place to come with your family and friends."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place! The food is amazing and so is the service.  I cannot point to one favorite but we can highly recommend the chicken fried steak or the Golden State Benedict. I can say we have not had one bad breakfast at this place or experience. My husband and I have made this place a staple in our weekends. Go and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a very large selection of breakfast options this is the place. There's something for any taste bud plus beer, mimosas, and bloody Mary's. The owners and staff were extremely friendly. Overall we had a great experience."}
{"text":"If I could give it less stars I would. Service was horrible. Arrived and seated right away. Server did not come by for 10 minutes. Had to ask another server walking by for coffee, which was $2.75 a cup. 
Had the Monte Cristo. It was ok. Hash browns were greasy. Wife had ham and egg scramble again ok. Had one refill of coffee. 
A busser walked by, cleared my empty plate, but left my wife's plate and other used cups and plates on the table. I thought that was odd.
Bill was brought and I waited 10 more minutes to get my card back.
The food and service are nowhere near the caliber of what is served in San Diego. Next time I'll go to Burger King next door and save about $20. Will not be back to this location in AZ."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast. It's cute, it's clean, and the service is always great. But more importantly, the food is consistently outstanding. They have a wide variety of interesting dishes, making it hard to choose. The freshly squeezed O.J. is another plus. My only gripe is it's a bit pricey, but if you join their club you get points and discounts which help offset the bill periodically. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Made suggestions, got food quickly, and the food was what you expected. Not overly pricey for a place with quality food and service. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I had the yogurt parfait with a side of 2 poached eggs (cooked perfectly) and 2 turkey sausage patties, that weren't overly greasy! Service was great and friendly, food came out quick and hot. Mile high omelet was ordered too and the portion was massive! Perfectly cooked and not greasy!!! Delicious! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Wednesday morning. The place was moderately busy. We were greeted and shown to our seats right away. Our server was by a short time later. She was friendly and engaging. I started off with a orange juice. The OJ is served in a tall, skinny glass. Upon reviewing the egg shaped menu, I decided on the breakfast sandwich. The sandwich included bacon, cheese and a fried egg on white toast, it was served with a side of your choice of home fries, hashbrowns or fresh fruit. I chose the home fries. The sandwich was delicious, and the home fries were cooked perfectly. The portions are large. The place is clean and the service is quick and friendly. Overall a good experience and I will visit again."}
{"text":"I ordered an to go order from here today. In my opinion. I would not order from here again wether it was to go or sitting down. I ordered the border Benedict with homefries and a side or fruit and asparagus. I also ordered the Machaca with also a side of fruit. Both of the sides of fruits I ordered came with 3 pieces, which was ridiculous in my opinion. I would've much rather them just be forgotten. The asparagus was gross. Had absolutely no flavor or effort at all. The actual border Benedict wasn't that good either. I tasted the eggs and didn't touch them again after one bite. The bread under the carne asade was also flavorless. I had the basically add my one seasonings to the meat. I never finished it."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from this place and was not impressed at all. The pancakes were just average and the chicken noodle soup was as well. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Visiting family in Arizona and took three grandchildren midweek for brunch. I had a gaslamp sandwich that presented beautifully, was fresh, and very tasty.  One grandson had country Benedict and he said it was the best.  two other grandchildren had pancakes, with bacon and fresh fresh fruit sliced daily.  The pancakes (2) were large and in the shape of Mickey Mouse which made the girls giggle.  Jim, the owner was on site and very attentive to all the customers. Talked with him for a bit and it was obvious that he was very excited to bring this restaurant to Arizona. Can't say enough about the great service.JULI was our server and  she was spot on phenomenal.If  you like fresh food that is plentiful on your plate, head over to Broken Yolk. You won't be disappointed.  Can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was delicious. Huge portions! My first time here and I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Brooks was attentive, our food was delicious, I have two small kids with me I mentioned I'd share with one of them and he was kind enough to separate the food prior to bring in it out.... excellent service with a smile"}
{"text":"This may be our new breakfast place! Our waitress was nice and attentive. Our food came out quickly and the atmosphere was relaxing. I loved that they had big screen tvs playing various sports. The portions were huge. Their stuffed french toast was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Relaxed and friendly breakfast spot. We had our needs meet with ease and the staff was very accommodating. Our waitress, Juli, was sweet and attentive, making sure we were always taken care of. Check it out - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came in for mimosas and brunch. Amazing crunchy french toast and mimosa flights! We also tried the dreamsicle mimosa watermelon mimosa. Staff was friendly and service was quick. Will be back"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place! This breakfast restaurant is everything you want in an all the time kinda place! The food is always great and the staff is always so friendly! My favorite server here is Manda. I make sure I always come in on her days, she is just so amazing makes you feel like you are her only table. She got me hooked on the watermelon Mimosas and now I have brought so many friends in for mimosa Sunday and every time my family is in town we stop in to see her as well! The owners are amazing and always make sure to stop by the table to check in and see how things are going. This is such a great family place you just gotta go in! q"}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch at Broken Yolk. Was very excited to try the pomegranate mimosa and was not let down. I got the American breakfast, eggs over easy with bacon, hash browns, and toast. It was delicious and I had to force myself to stop eating. Bae got the biscuits and gravy with bacon. Strangely, the bacon was on the biscuits under the gravy.  I would have been super disappointed had it been me (I like my bacon in all its solo glory). The gravy was good and the biscuits were the size of softballs. Overall it was a great experience, but a little pricey for where it is located in Mesa and the tables can get cramped if there's four of you. They close at 3 so you can't delay getting there, but def a recommendation if you're in the area. Looking at all the dishes that passed up, I think it's safe to say \"bring your appetite\"."}
{"text":"Visiting Mesa, AZ on an out west National Park vacation & this spot was recommended by the clerk at our hotel...I've never been more glad for a recommendation!!
The staff was fast, engaging, friendly & clearly knew their stuff (even able to discuss ingredients & prep tips). The menu had a little something for everyone for both breakfast & lunch spanning from the usual to Mexican inspired spins on traditional options.
The food...WOW! The Border Benedict was amazing! Steak...poached eggs...sweet corn cake (in place of the usual English muffin) smothered in an awesome Poblano pepper sauce that not only tasted fresh & amazing bit is relatively easy to make (per our server, Manda). The portion size is large."}
{"text":"It had a good breakfast, they had regular breakfast items so it would be a good place for anyone that's a picky breakfast eater."}
{"text":"I love this place
 Clean,  friendly, beautifully decorated, the food portions are HUGE. They also just came out with their Fall/Winter drinks- the peppermint latte is soooo good!! The owners Jen and Jimmy are the most honest, hard working people I've ever met. They are so down to earth and funny - we love this place.

My 5 year old son says that he loves how they have a lot of yummy breakfast and that he thinks it's one if the greatest places on earth!! Haha!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in a long time!   Staff is very friendly and helpful.  I'm looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We had breakfast today on 8/20 and it was awesome so was the staff,we will be back for sure. Nice breakfast menu too, something for everyone. It's all good. Our server was the nicest person. Ask for Brooks Hubby had the American Breakfast and I had the Fiesta Burrito...."}
{"text":"This was not a great experience. The place looks like a thinly veiled Dennys and left me wishing I went there instead. I should have known when there wasn't a wait at 945am on a Sunday. The hostess, seeing that we have small kids  and being told we needed a high chair tried to seat us at a booth. We had to direct her to a table that could accommodate a high chair. The wait for drinks was very long. They are advertising cold brew coffee and when it arrived it was clearly watered down. It didn't taste like coffee at all. I ordered the Mimosa flight instead. Other than the orange, classic, they were awful. How do you mess up mimosas? Well, this place mixes cranberry juice and \"champagne\" and raisins. They mix \"champagne\" and the juice that comes with maraschino cherries. I ordered a build your own egg white omelette that came to $15. It was cold, as were the hash browns. I think the onions were frozen. Nothing at all was fresh. My husband had the chicken and waffle Benedict that was also cold, as were his home fries, and completely lacking flavor. The hollandaise was clearly from a mix and water-thin. Our children shared a waffle and it was cold and gummy, it's one of their favorite things and they wouldn't touch it. Even the fruit was bland! I'd say the service was at a snails pace but that might offend snails. The whole experience was nauseating and, even worse, not cheap!"}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast today for my first trip to this cafe. The interior is reminiscent of an IHOP, but the service, menu and food are top notch! Gina was our server, and she is ON it. Our coffee cups were never under half full. She's prompt on ordering, and our meals came out quickly. Portion sizes are large! My coworker ordered the power wrap with egg whites, spinach and peppers. She said it's delicious; served with a side of fruit. I made my own omelet with avocado, turkey bacon and turkey sausage... it was exactly what I was craving! It is served with two sides- I opted for fruit only, but there are about 7-8 options! The menu is full of really creative options I would love to come back to try out! Thank you Gina for a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic service (our server was Amanda). I had the chilaquiles with eggs, which were excellent. My husband had the Baja tacos, which he liked, though he said he would have liked more chorizo in them. I would eat there again."}
{"text":"I had the the Mom (Veggie Omelet) no sprouts and with fresh fruit and Blueberry Muffin.  For someone that is trying to eat clean it was perfect.  It was not salty.  Was impressed that had fresh fruit instead of canned.  My husband had the Stuffed French Toast with Bananas and Marscapone cheese.  He loved it except he was hoping it was little sweeter.  Otherwise bread was cooked right and served with lots of bananas.  Homemade Blueberry muffin was incredible.  My server was very helpful and cheerful.  We received our meals within 10 minutes.  I noticed someone always greeted customers as they walked in.  To me that is very important.  I was overall impressed with the whole experience.  Besides their Breakfast menu had so
Much variety.  Loved it."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. It was prepared as if I it made at home. They serve large portions. Loved their waffles!!!! 
The only reason I'm giving four stars is...
We had to flag down someone for our silverware, 
Asked for lemons and something else other than that our experiences was awesome. 
We will be returning for the food, I'm sure they were really busy when we couldn't get our stuff."}
{"text":"Wow what a nice surprise. Old Village inn becomes a great family restaurant. Exceptional eggs Benedict, good service and pretty good prices. Definitely will leave full."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great restaurant to frequent for breakfast or lunch, I would highly recommend this cafe. I decided to take my wife out to breakfast and we found this place on our drive down Southern Avenue in Mesa. It's not often you find amazing service and food often. We found now twice after eating here! Our server Sarah was great she made sure everything was to our satisfaction and kept coming. Ack to make sure we were doing well. Their GM Jennifer is also very hands on as well and was available to speak with us. The have a variety of food and drink. Good Mimosa's and their waffles and pancakes are crazy good!"}
{"text":"Just drove by looking for a breakfast place and decided to stop and try this place. What a discovery! Unique and delicious menu choices and great service. I took a chance and had the \"Savory Crepes\" to try something unique. Glad I did. Get the side of eggs and bacon and you've got a great breakfast experience!"}
{"text":"First of all my server was crappy,  her name is Amanda A. 

In Arizona and decided to stop by for a quick breakfast since there is one in CALI by my house. This is my second time here this week,  first time was for lunch and it was OK. 

I am now here for breakfast and the same server is here.  She needs to be a lot friendlier, she has that resting b*tch face or just always in a crappy mood.  If you are going to be a server,  work on your personality to serve your clients. 

I got an orange juice which is yummy,  you can't go wrong with OJ and a short stack of blueberry pancakes. They were nothing special and the berries were not fresh,  they weren't even blue! I politely asked the server if they were fresh and she had the nerve to walk to the kitchen and yell at her cooks if they were fresh.  I could hear her from my seat!  Rude. I wish I had a good camera where I cab take a picture of these \"fresh\" blueberries.  I'm seriously so disgusted now.  

Overall my experience was mediocre,  only reason why I came here again was because it's close to my destination and didn't feel like driving around look for good breakfast."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast, obviously! The Border Benedict is quite delicious. I've also tried their more traditional breakfast fare, and everything has been excellent. Food is good with generous portions and a great variety on the menu. Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place since we're always happy to see a new breakfast place in the area.  They've redone the space (what used to be The Egg and I), and the inside looks very nice and comfy.  I especially liked that they put up some window shades since the sun can beam pretty bright during those early mornings.

There is a good-sized menu with a variety of options.  The prices are not super cheap, but I think it's about what you'd expect.  The food was decent.  I had the Egg Benedict, and while the sauce was delicious, the egg was a little bit overdone.  No runny yolk on this one.  Regardless, it was still good enough that I'll give it another chance (the closeness to our house might play a part in that decision).  The hubby had Country Fried Steak and Eggs, and while it wasn't mind-blowing, he was satisfied with the taste and portion.

The service was friendly and attentive.  Will this place be an once-in-a-lifetime culinary experience?  Probably not.  But I am inclined to come back and try other items.  (The ladies by us had their lunch wraps, and they were HUGE.)"}
{"text":"This place has lots of regulars who ask to be seated in their favorite waitresses section.. I think that says a lot about a place. 

There is no real wait at lunch time mid-week. Which is great, drinks & food come out fast.. plenty of breakfast & lunch options to choose from.

The berry salad with the soup & sandwich is delicious.."}
{"text":"Meh, I really wanted to like this place. The waiter is nice, the seating is clean, and the place has a cute easy vibe. However, I ordered the crunchy French toast and the French toast was missing the crunchy! It just tasted like warm bread... 
Overall, this place was quite disappointing. Quick update: I saw an employee come in with 6 boxes of Frosted Flakes...turns out they were low on Frosted Flakes and they were aware the French toast did not taste right, the waitress was very nice and offered to remove the item from the bill. 
I think I will come back and try the French toast again! Let's hope next time it's better!"}
{"text":"All the food is exceptional. I had the Golden State Benedict and it was phenomenal! The hash browns were perfect and the proportions are good. I used the menu to try to help me figure this out with their caloric values listed--right on. The coffee is truly as strong as my peeps warned me about. The mimosas are wonderful! The only place to get an assortment of different flavor. Today they are offering the Red White and Blue mimosa. Raspberry and blue curacao."}
{"text":"I was out of town over the weekend visiting my best friend for her housewarming party. Needless to say, the party was epic, the night got out of hand, and we woke up Sunday morning regretting life. We needed hair of the dog salvation in the form of greasy food and mimosas, so we loaded up the party van (a soccer mom-type mini van that we rented for our road trip to Arizona) and headed to Broken Yolk. Even though this restaurant has locations in California, this was my first time visiting one.

It was noon on a Sunday, and our group of six was seated immediately, with no wait, at a roomy corner booth. Our waitress knew we were hungover, commiserated with us a little, and gave us excellent service.

For under $6 each, you can choose from either classic or pomegranate mimosas. I was trying not to hurl, so I stuck with the classic. They come in giant glasses, so it's quite a deal.

On their menu, they have ample vegetarian and gluten-free selections -- including gluten-free traditional and pumpkin pancakes. Yum! They also have an entire menu section dedicated to every type of eggs benedict you could ever dream of, and a few different types of biscuits and gravy.

I ordered the Mom Omelette (momlette?) with home fries and fruit (instead of the bread it usually comes with). The home fries were basically just potatoes sliced like scalloped potatoes. Mine were a little under crispy and under seasoned, so I added salt, pepper and Heinz 57 ketchup (catsup?). The fruit cup came with pineapple, an orange slice, watermelon, cantaloup and honeydew. The omelette itself was huge and probably had at least 4 eggs in it. It also wasn't seasoned, so I added more salt, pepper and Heinz 57.

Overall, this was a great hungover dining experience. If you're looking for traditional breakfast food at a place that's a step up from Denny's and iHop but still not too fancy, I recommend.

The portions here are huge! You definitely get your bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"We go here almost every weekend. They have such a great selection of breakfast items and our food gets to our table in the blink of an eye! Their waffles are most definitely my favorite!"}
{"text":"I decided to start a yelp account specifically for this restaurant.  I just love the down to earth staff and atmosphere here.  I also don't want to forget to mention the food is fantastic!! The Border Benedict is my favorite along with the stuffed French toast!!! I really like how they have no problem with making food modifications. It's actually encouraged because they want you to be happy. 

As I enjoy everyone there... Natalie is my favorite! She is the one who always says \"I encourage you to modify your food how you like it, I want you to be happy\" she always makes sure my coffee is full no matter how busy it is , and has such a relaxing demeanor. She will tell you what her honest opinion is on anything you ask about on the menu. I have also noticed there are so many of the same waiters that have been there since opening day and always have nice things to say about each other and the owners. That should say something."}
{"text":"In town for a weekend with friends and stopped in for Sat breakfast. Mmmmmmmm. Excellent decision. I had a made-to-order omelette which was HUGE and tasted great. Owners Jim and Jen were kind to stop and say hello and we all felt like old friends. GREAT experience!!"}
{"text":"I love eggs Benedict but the western Benedict here blows my mind. This is my go to breakfast spot. Good service and great food."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Crave the chicken fried steak with an over easy egg on top. Smothered in country gravy ALMOST as good as mine (nanas recipe w/ jimmy dean sausage - yes, that good!). Tough choice too considering the Benedict's are just as tasty. 

This is my weekend breakfast go to. Usually get table for 2 right away or within 10 min. 

Forget Snooze, The Farmhouse or any of those other \"trendy\" places in Gilbert with their smallish portions and forever wait times. Cruise a little north on Gilbert rd to Southern and check this place out."}
{"text":"Usually get these guys through UberEats when I'm too lazy to go out or not feeling well in the mornings. Food is almost always on point. Their omelets are good, so are their biscuits & gravy. Only thing that I've ever gotten from them that didn't blow me away was their steak...good sometimes, overdone other times. It's a good breakfast place overall. Also heard they have a challenge involving a dozen egg omelet drowning in chili; I'll have to check it out in person some time."}
{"text":"Not your average breakfast joint. Very flavorful food. Has kind of a long wait on the weekends but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Love this place!  It is clean, has good service and the food is great!  The omelet's are huge, 4 eggs, plus hash browns and bread.  Fortunately our waitress Sarah, let us know how big the portions are so my wife and I split the no name omelet.  In fact, the staff split our order for us.  We substituted some refried beans for the bread and got a side of fruit.  Everything we had was good!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was eh.. It took the hostess a few minutes to come up to the front to seat ppl.."}
{"text":"Food is always good,good service,however the coffee is bad. QT,McDonalds,&Circle have better coffee."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch with my husband and daughter and frankly would have been better off at Village Inn or IHOP. The Broken Yolk is conveniently located and the decor inside is nice and comfortable. We were seated quickly and offered drinks. I ordered coffee and my family water/soda. My coffee was lukewarm and old and my request for fresh was not appreciated given the servers attitude. We ordered omelette and pancakes and my daughter had a waffle. She loved hers however our food was cold and seriously bland. Even our short stack was cold enough to not melt the butter.  There was very little meat in the omelet, way to much tasteless cheese, mushy cold potatoes and burnt bacon. My hubby did however say the ginormous biscuit was very good. Our plates were sent back without the staff even questioning the amount of uneaten food. No refills on coffee, water or soda were provided or offered. All this and a $50 dollar tab (including tip) and I think it's safe to say we won't be back!"}
{"text":"So good. So much variety. So much food. Such good prices. Super nice staff. Will definitely return with family and friends again. Had a 10 minute wait for Sunday brunch which wasn't bad at all."}
{"text":"Have only been there once so far. Had a very enjoyable breakfast experience. The food was delicious and the staff was super friendly. I am looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"I had the stuffed French toast my boyfriend had the club sandwich everything was absolutely wonderful I also had the Mimosa it was one of the best mimosas I've had in a long time I have to give this place a thumbs up this place was absolutely wonderful"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Didn't even get our water right when seating us. Inexperienced servers. Terrible, tasteless food. I ordered a side of bacon with my eggs Benedict. This bacon looked like one slice of bacon sliced into 3 , see through, and each piece skinier than my pinky finger, on a bare, full sized plate. They got my girls order wrong and argued with her about it. When asking how our food was the waitress continued walking past us before we could respond. The hash browns were basically instant potatoes smashed flat and fried. It was crap. The food, the service, all of it. I wouldn't eat here if it was free. Dennys is a five star classy restaurant compared to this place. I'm actually upset I can't give less than one star here."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming here and let me tell you, I'm never coming back. The service was awful. It took a long time before our waitress even came to take our drink order. Then, our drinks took too long to actually get to our table and at that point she let us know one of the drinks we ordered weren't even available anymore. When my latte came out, she gave me the wrong one and again took forever to replace it. Coffee cups weren't filled up pretty much ever. I've been here for over an hour and the food still hasn't come out and haven't been given an update as to what is going on. Honestly going to just walk out in about 5 minutes.
***update***
Our food finally arrived but it was hit and miss. My Benedict was ok but the hashbrowns were awful. My cousin ordered a burger and the egg was old as hell and the onion rings were cold. He sent it back and couldn't even eat it. The only good thing is the comp'd the drinks and discounted our meal. But again. Just a terrible experience and not how I wanted to spend my Sunday."}
{"text":"It's rare I give a five star, but this place was worth it. Not only was the food good but the service was outstanding! As a previous breakfast manager this place was on point. And there were Tv's all around. And seeing as it was Sunday,  we were able to watch football as we sipped our bloody Mary,  flight of Mimosas and Sope Benedict.  Delish! Not to mention the nice stranger next to us paid for our meal! We'll be back #payitforward"}
{"text":"Really good.  Went for Breakfast and the service was fast and the food was hot and yummy.  I prefer egg whites, plain English with no butter and it came exactly the way I ordered it.  Great location and great people there."}
{"text":"Read the reviews an though I would give this place a try. After waiting a few minutes up front to be seated no one noticed me. A waitress just starting her shift walking through the door had some one seat me. Waited another 10min before my waitress even noticed me. Food came out pretty fast for being a steady pace. The portions are very genorues but the food lacked flavor. Had to load up on salt and hot sauce. Over all not to impressed bye the poor quality service. I would come back but for sure would request a different waitress."}
{"text":"Not very good we should have known at 8 o'clock on a Monday morning when there's no one in the place but us scrambled eggs were ok chicken fried steak not very good fruit had no flavor oatmeal was way runny hardly any oats in it at all and my grilled chicken breast with so tough I actually should have asked for a steak knife to cut it."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered a vegetarian omelet tasted bland, veggies looked like they were microwaved, disappointed."}
{"text":"Showed up for breakfast on a Sunday @ 11am. Large crowd outside, but 15-20 min wait inside. Likely won't be back, for the following reason: Both hubby & I had off stomachs afterwards. 

There was ample seating in the lobby. The music was of varied taste & the restaurant is extremely loud when busy. Lots of TVs around with football games on all but one. The menu has a lot of Southwest dishes on it & overall was kinda spendy. Hubby ordered a buttermilk  pancake combo, while I had a bacon & onion create-your-own omelet only (allergic to potatoes - so many food allergies! - & don't eat bread). Eggs don't normally bother me, nor do bacon & onions, but I found myself with an upset stomach & itching, so I have to wonder about the oil used for cooking, along with anything in the omelet mix. Hubby is not allergic, but we could suspect the milk he drank with breakfast, since he's beginning to have issues with it. Don't know if they have an allergen menu; didn't see anything like that on their main menu.

The saving grace to this review was our server, Sarah. Sweet lady, always smiling, and very good at her job!

Wish I could've given a better review, but I'm still itching. :("}
{"text":"uuuhhh no just a big fat \"no\"! i dont care how how much food you get it's not good!! i ordered the \"mom omelette\". the veggies were cold, poratoes were luke warm, sourdough toast was cold, sheesh what else can go wrong...oh yeah after our food was served the waitress didn't bother to come over to ask us how the food was, as if she already knew it was awful. but, that didn't keep her from telling another table her life story after thier food was served.  go to another restaurant...any other restaurant, it will be better than this over priced place."}
{"text":"This place was good. They gave a ton of food to eat. It was a little pricy and I was disappointed that getting a side of pancakes cost almost as much as my meal did. There was a little too much cheese in my eggs too. If I go again, I'd get my omelette without cheese."}
{"text":"This was our first time in and we loved it.  I had the chicken and waffles and my hubby had a build your own omelet. We're taking half of it home.  Lots of good food for the price you pay!  And our waitress was totally nice.  I noticed that she also remembers her regulars and their dietary needs.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, waitress was friendly. Not as nice as their Californian sister but okay. Place needs a deep cleaning. Schmutz on the glass and smudges on booth seats."}
{"text":"Loved it! I had biscuits and gravy and it was simply fab!  Service was genuinely friendly. (I despise the generic, robotic \"howareyouwhatcanIgetforyou...\" spiel )
Impressed! I will be back!"}
{"text":"So my wife and I tried this today because we wanted to find a new breakfast place. We were unfortunately quite disappointed. 

First the positives. The restaurant was very clean, kept up, and inviting. Also the staff was friendly. That's about as far as the positives go.

It was quite expensive for what we got. Most of the breakfast had to be bought ala cart and it added up quickly (over 30 dollars for the two of us) and we didn't get much for it. The food ranged from mediocre to just plain bad. Both of our meat selections were cold and tasted like old re-heated meat. The French toast I had was ok, but below average. 

I feel bad that we didn't find a new place and that the food wasn't all that good. We unfortunately won't be coming back. The staff and the place itself, like I said earlier, were nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for breakfast,  been here a few times now and I will continue to come back.  Very friendly staff and quick to serve you. If you don't know about this place you might know it from man vs food when he does the challenge that is here.  The challenge is a massive meal so if your hungry go ahead and take care of business. 

The food is filling and full of flavor and if you get mimosas you can get a bottle and leave it at your table, how can you go wrong with that! 

Next time here we need to try what type of lunch they have to explore the menu more."}
{"text":"Broken Yolk has been on my radar for a while. My wife and I came on a Wednesday morning, a day after senior discount Tuesday. :( The large dining room offered both booth and table seating. Our waitress promptly took our beverage order. After reviewing the menu I noticed a few unique items such as Nutella crepes, which I ordered. Three homemade crepes filled with Nutella and your choice of fresh sliced bananas or strawberries. Drizzled with more Nutella and topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream. Rich and creamy, this is more like a desert than  breakfast. My mouth immediately did a happy dance with the first bite. During the course f the meal I noticed the waitresses bringing out other orders. I saw a few items I will be ordering in the future. And yes, I will be back in the near future."}
{"text":"A great new place for the weekend breakfast rotation. Huge portions of great food at reasonable prices. A bit of a wait due to its popularity, but great service once seated. Visited by the owner & wife at separate times while eating, making sure everything was on track. I had an an omelet and it was excellent and massive. Potatoes were solid, and the toast was even above average. Beverages served in super-large glasses, which pretty much eliminates need for refills and helps the waitresses serve everyone more efficiently. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After a friend posted a pic of mimosa flights had to try this place..  overall food looks amazing and we tried the fried French toast and it was great.. the mimosa flight was good and I would say my only complaint was the atmosphere.. it was too staunch and quiet.  I get it for a bfast joint but it would be cool if they built a bar off the main restaurant with a more lively atmosphere"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in this area.  I get the border Benedict and it is fantastic!!!!!  I highly recommend this restaurant with its cleanliness and excellent service and GREAT food."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times and have always had absolutely the best service, and never had a problem with the food or prices. I also have been getting a lot of coupons in the mail for free coffee and buy one get one half off meals. I really hope this place stays around because I love going there and having a great breakfast. Thanks Broken Yolk!"}
{"text":"I love crepes and order them whenever possible, however this was the worst crepe I've ever had. It wasn't even anything near a crepe. What it was was a pancake rolled up with Nutella and bananas on top. If I wanted a pancake, that's what I would have ordered. I think they need to google the word crepe and then learn to make a real one. Never ordered anything else from here. But I'm disappointed in the crepe."}
{"text":"It was okay. The one in Pacific Beach California is better. Just had a negative experience from the time we placed our order. We waited for 50 min before our food came out, and when it finally did, you can tell it was rushed out of the kitchen. My wife's omelette was cooked all the way and the toppings were uncooked. You're talking bell peppers, onions, sprouts and a blackish looking avocado on one of their more featured items. My huevos rancheros came with only one egg, there wasn't enough sauce and the guac was also blackish. The only thing that came out right was my daughters burger and fries. The excuse we were given was that there was a large party that. And in and they had to push that food out. Would have been convincing if we didn't just watch everyone else around us get there, order, receive, then finish their food before we got ours. It's going to take a lot of convincing to bring me back to this location. So sad..."}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday morning and they were a little busy.  We didn't wait long and the staff did seem on the ball.  We got to our table and our server introduced herself quickly and brought our drinks pretty fast.  I proceeded to order the Fiesta Burrito and my husband ordered Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  All I can say is yum and double yum.  Soooooooo good.  Even the coffee was good.  Not only was the food good, the plates were huge.  After we ate the manager did stop by to see if we were happy with our food.  Of course we were.  

I am so glad this place opened because this place is my new hot spot for breakfast or brunch.  I am definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"Come and relax. Friday morning the place was not overly full, server was prompt and attentive.  The golden state Benedict was Devine. Kids meals had plenty of options and variety. The tvs on the walls make it enjoyable to sit and relax and zone for a few, even after your meal. as long as the kids are entertained you can stay a while for sure - blessing their liquor license and the mimosas this could be an all day thing (which sadly I did not try but looked delicious)."}
{"text":"I had the western eggs benedict and they were excellent, service was pretty good and the place wasn't too crowded for a Sunday AM. Very clean and well run. Thanks!"}
