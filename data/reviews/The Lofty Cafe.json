{"text":"I'm a big fan of cupcakes, and Lofty doesn't disappoint. I definitely recommend stopping in and having a few (get six, because you'll want more later). The latte flavor is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and wanted to share my thoughts. This place was great when it first opened. What happened ?? Food is not the same. Neither is service. I agree with previous poster. Something is off----- better get it together guys!"}
{"text":"I am basing this only from a brief visit. It was brief because we were in the mood for a cupcake & their selection was very limited. None of what they had looked appealing and the empty plate stands with smeared remainings of cupcakes made it even less desirable. By keeping the dirty plates in the case, it made the available ones seem like they had been sitting there like new ones weren't going to be made until the last few were gone. While I was there, I thought I'd try to get a flavored coffee because I could see they had a few flavored syrups. I asked the girl what they had and she said, \"we only have coffee\". Clearly not trying to push any coffee here! 

I will be back because I want to promote this place-it seems like it can have great potential and the sandwiches posted on Yelp look delicious! 

Until next time..."}
{"text":"Wow, so glad to have this place in the Falls!  The menu contains plenty of healthy, vegetarian options.  The sandwiches are better than home made, & the cup cakes are soft, delicious, & filled with deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Not a place you want to go if you have limited time. They are over priced and not only slow but got my entire order wrong. The best part is that my lunch break is 45min and it took them almost that long to make a sandwich. Will not be going there again."}
