{"text":"The service is very good, the server was very helpful and showed us how to properly eat the BBQ beef and shrimp dish we ordered. The prices are affordable and I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. I often place delivery orders for my office group, sometimes up to 15 separate orders. Green Basil always delivers on time, taking any kind of tender for payment on delivery and they don't mind that I have everyone in the office pay separately. If there is ever an issue, which is rare, they rectify it right away. Outstanding service! Dining in is always nice too, with a comfortable atmosphere and accommodating staff. Definitely an office favorite!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. Service is great. Very clean. The only thing I'm upset about is the fact I've never been here before. We ordered the pad Thai,  tom khai soup and prawn coconut curry. It all was wonderful. Their menu is huge. Tonnes to choose from meat or vegetarian. Lots of Vietnamese choices. I highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim when Pho Chu The ended up being closed. This is a fusion of Thai and Vietnamese cuisines. The interior space is way nicer and larger than it looks. We went on Sunday night and it was business than we were expecting.   I ordered Szechuan style noodles. It was delicious. I had asked to make it spicy but that wasn't enough. But the flavours were amazing and it hit the spot.   Ordered the fried banana ice cream dessert. It was pretty good for its price.   Overall a great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Terrible food. For $10 they serves me plain noddles with limp gross lettuce and brown bean sprouts. When I asked if they had cucumber or peanuts or carrots or anything resembling a vegetable they could add, the waitress yelled at me."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend, who recommended it highly, as part of a \"plan B\". The plaza was not the best, and it lacked frontage to Macleod Trail, so I would never have found it on my own. I ordered vermicelli with BBQ'd pork, but received vermicelli noodles with beef. Rather than wait for a re-do, I decided to go with the dish delivered in error. OMG, the beef was good! Noodles are noodles, of course, but the veggies were perfect; crisp, clean, cold, and as nice as it gets. This was, without a doubt, the best vermicelli beef dish I've had anywhere in Calgary. Also, service (on a busy Friday noon) was excellent. The restaurant is very nice on the inside, clean and has a good feeling. Also, busy, which is nice to see. For Vietnamese/Thai, this hidden gem will certainly be one of my new favourites. Price-point was excellent, too. But I'm coming back for the quality food and the service. I love to support local, when local deserves the support."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I went with a bunch of guy friends who work about 10min away. I would never ever have gone into that restaurant  probably because it is in a really obscure place and I really dont think you can see it from the street. The guys that I went with who work at a company about ten minutes away go there 2-3 times a week, and it's over 6 months they are eating there.  They have told me they have never had a bad or off meal.  This restaurant clean and the food is consistently delicious! I tasted everyones' dish and I would have really enjoyed a small portion from everyone meal instead of only having my one meal.  I cannot wait to go back I just wish it was closer to home!  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"The interior was clean and comfortable and the menu was nice and easy to read. We had a noodle dish, some spring rolls and the Pad Thai. I really enjoyed everything about my meal and the price was decent. I will likely eat here for lunch again soon."}
