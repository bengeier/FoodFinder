{"text":"I love this place. Convenient, very nice wood decor and friendly staff. The sushi rivals more expensive downtown locations - try the Peter Pan roll, not on the menu but seriously delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi!!  We have been coming to this restaurant for several years and they do sushi better than any restaurant in the Charlotte area!  The Peter Pan Roll is great and if you want something without rice, the Spicy Saigon Tuna Wrap will not disappoint!!!  Right across from the Siskey Y!"}
{"text":"Best chicken and fried rice in Matthews. My wife recommends the vegetable fried rice. Very simple. Great take out food.    KevinDebi"}
{"text":"The best chicken and steak hibachi, beef noodle soup,  and sesame chicken we have had.  The waiter,  Aaron was awesome.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I stumbled on that place at random. Man im glad I did, best asian place I had lunch at. Not many customers, promt service so we had no trouble waiting on anything, Theyr lunch specials are awesome, reasonable price and delicious food. Thank you one-U."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The lunch specials are a great bargain and the quality of the food is very high.  The owner, Michelle, is very nice.  Don't let the strip mall location stop you from eating here."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the occasional Sushi, but this little restaurant amazed us with how delicious all the food was and very inexpensive!  We have been four times and have tried multiple rolls off the menu and have loved them all!  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite place to grab sushi after trying everything in a 10 mile radius. Quality food for a good price. Their lunch deal is awesome!"}
{"text":"We have gone several times in the past and enjoyed it, but if I had only gone once I would never go back after my last visit. The sesame chicken tasted burned. My husband and I were sharing it and sushi. She offered to take mine back and let me order another sushi roll saying it should come out fast. My hub was starving so he just ate his half burned. We were the only people in the restaurant and the guy you can watch making sushi still spent 10 mins watching tv before making my new order. She only offered us 1/2 off of the chicken she had taken away explaining that lots of people think it is burned on the days they fresh marinade and complain about it but that it was just the smoke in the soy sauce and charged us full price for the replacement food I had ordered. I was really annoyed and disappointed and honestly don't know why she didn't offer an explanation or solution before taking my food."}
{"text":"Have eaten here multiple times and have always had great sushi and a positive experience. Lunch specials are tremendous value. 

Highly recommend, quality, consistency, great service and the food is always great.  Strip mall on outside but great atmosphere inside."}
{"text":"32 years old and have NEVER written a review however the food here was SO stunning. Lunch general Taos chicken was 5.95 and ALL WHITE MEAT! Thats right all white and FRESH baby corn, broccoli and red and green bell peppers. The sauce was absolutely perfect. Just enough sweet and heat to be out of this world. Needless to say I will NEVER eat general's chicken any where else. They also have sushi that I cannot wait to try. Do yourself a favor and TRY THE"}
{"text":"I'd just like to update how slooooooow this place is. I forgot after the first visit, but it did take at least an hour for sushi to show up after appetizers. Really nice sushi, and very reasonably priced, but the wait has been inordinately long both visits."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal. These guys make really good food. The downside is they may be a bit slow but it's because it's family owned, made fresh, and there's a husband and wife team only working the kitchen and the sushi bar. They need some help but are particular and want everything prepared their way. I hope people support them so they can stay in the location they have which is large. To me, it's worth the wait for some really well made food."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall location fool you - One-U is a great place for consistently good Japanese food. I've eaten here probably 15 times and I love this place. The owners and staff are super friendly. The Peter Pan roll is terrific - and even better when you have a tall Sapporo with it! The tempura is very good; I've had tempura in Japan and this is on par with what you would get in Tokyo. The brown noodle side dish (I think they call them spaghetti noodles) have a great sesame flavor. They also have dishes like Pad Thai if you prefer Thai cuisine. I've never had a bad meal at One-U."}
{"text":"I can comment only on the sushi, because that's what I get (almost) every Tuesday. Why Tuesday? Glad you asked. On Tuesdays, all nigiri sushi and sashimi are $1 a piece. That's a nice discount when some nigiri pieces are regularly priced at $2 and $2.50.
 
Of course, cheap sushi isn't a good deal unless it's good sushi - and, as other reviewers have testified, this IS good stuff. The chef and co-owner, Tony (a friendly guy, originally from Malaysia), knows what he's doing. He used to work in (and own?) a NYC Japanese restaurant. He cuts generous slices, and (as any pro should do) makes sure that what you're consuming is clean, fresh-smelling, appealing, and of excellent quality. The rice (not too firm; not too loose), soy sauce, and pickled ginger (white; no artificial coloring) is all prepared in-house. 
  
I've been eating sushi since the early '80s (I started in L.A.), and this is comparable to, or better than, what I've had elsewhere. The selection is reasonably broad for an eatery of this size and for the traffic it has. All of the most popular sushi/sashimi is on the menu - and there is an extensive list of rolls.
 
If you're not far from the location, and crave some rockin' sushi, get on over there."}
{"text":"Great Food and Great Prices.  I go here for lunch every week.  They have great lunch specials and the Thai and Chinese dishes are great also.  Never had a bad meal.  Everything is very fresh.  Chicken is white meat. Great Sushi and some incredible specialty rolls (Cherry Blossom and Peter Pan are must have)"}
{"text":"I'm only going to give the 4 versus the five stars are usually get. They only had a couple of servers so the service was slow. But the food was again very good and the sushi very fresh. It really is good for a very good price. This is probably the best sushi restaurant in Charlotte and I  highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sorry but this place blows most hibachi spots out of the water!  Sushi is good here too!  Come for the amazing lunch specials.  Orange chicken is crispy (REAL white meat chicken) in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce.  And I loooove the beef hibachi here...you dont even really need the shrimp and/or mustard sauce (even tho its awesome!) because the flavor on the dish itself is great!  Our server Karen is the best!  My current weekly spot"}
{"text":"This place is so convenient for when I am at my oldest sister's house.  As in right across the street convenient.  We like to order from here when we are too lazy to cook.  They have good lunch deals.  I love the chicken yaki-soba.  Rolls are good and range in price from like $3-$12.  Good gyoza and edamame.

Overall very solid, cheapish, convenient food."}
{"text":"Exploring different restaurants after our new move. Went here to try finding a really good sushi place closer to our house. Unfortunately not as good as some of the others we have found. The best by far if New Zealand. We will drive the extra distance to get there for a better experience. 

About this experience - slow service and mediocre food. Not much flavor in the teriyaki chicken in my bento box. California roll was good. Not very crowded on a Friday evening. Still not sure why it took so long to get our order other than a lot of fake out orders."}
{"text":"First visit here and only had the sushi rolls - shrimp tempura and boston rolls.  Both were really good and fresh. This place even has the japanese red pepper that many others don't. Ask for it if you need.  The lunch special prices are very reasonable and it's alot of food for the price you pay.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Ok sushi. Not sushi rice. Don't come here when you're really hungry for sushi. Waited an hour and a half for my lunch sushi combo. Finished it in less than ten minutes. The waiter was also very rude. The bathroom was over flooded. Bad experience over all 0/10 would not recommend.  Don't come here if you're poor af. Or if you're rich spend your money elsewhere. The guy making the sushi was slacking very much. He was really taking his time. If you do come here pay in coins. They love coins. Especially pennies"}
{"text":"Made to order sushi is great. Not your run of the mill sushi place. Very innovative and fresh."}
{"text":"You would think the place is horrible because it's in a strip mall and not packed out....don't be deceived! One-U is great! The Peter Pan roll is one of my favorites, and now (thanks to previous reviewer suggestion) so is the Cherry Blossom! We also absolutely love the Yaki Udon! Give these folks a try!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Staff is nice. Sushi is always good and they have great lunch specials. They will also make rolls with brown rice and have always made changes for us when asked. Spicy tuna rolls are just spicy enough and their ginger dressing is very good. They have added some Thai dishes to the menu as well. Both the basil beef and mango chicken are very good. For sushi lovers who dine with anti-sushiites it's nice to have a selection bigger than just teriyaki. Lastly, they make a very nice nabayaki udon soup. Just like moms. If you are Japanese...

Give this hidden little gem a try."}
{"text":"Great sushi! Many made to order rolls and a huge boat they deliver to your table filled with sushi for the whole table-great presentation. Their hibachi is also a crowd pleaser as well as their thai noodle dishes. 

You get comp. soup and they make their own fresh soy sauce-believe me once you taste it you can the difference between that and bottled soy!

Located in a strip mall. They do a ton of take-out but the sushi bar atmosphere is nice. The service is slow sometimes since they do a ouch take-out"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch on a rainy Friday with my mom and 2 year old based on good Yelp reviews. The place was completely empty and only 2 other people came while we were there. Loud rap music was playing. I could have done without Usher's stripper song.  

This place needs a good scrubbing. The floors hadn't been swept, there is a thick coat of dust on everything, and the windows were dirty. The bathroom was gross with rings in the toilet and grime on everything. It had not been cleaned in weeks or months. The place doesn't look like anyone cares. Unused chairs were shoved against walls in the halls. The place was also freezing. 

Despite the filth, we stayed to eat because it was pouring rain outside. The Hibachi lunch special (chicken and beef) for $8 was surprisingly good. They only have soft drinks in cans, which is a negative for me. The server didn't seem to know the menu or what was in the food. We asked her several questions and she couldn't answer any of them. 

Overall it was a subpar lunch experience. The ambience was terrible and the filth of the place overshadowed the decent food. I also noticed that their health inspection score was low so it seems the place has been in decline for awhile. If you want a cheerful lunch, skip this place. It's dirty and depressing."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in years and got take out last weekend. Love the summer roll and Peter Pan. Winter roll is nice as well. Excellent flavor on the squid salad, though we ordered seaweed salad, so the order was incorrect. Main complaint would be very slow service, and a lack of updates to the menu. It is the same as 2 years ago. Would love to see an update."}
{"text":"Will I have to thank a fellow yelper Tina K, This is absolutely my favorite place in Charlotte for any hibachi and Beef broccoli dishes. The flavor is awesome. I'm going back again but this time to try the sushi I can't wait if it's anything like what I've already had I'm sure it will be amazing.......till next time . Enjoy"}
