{"text":"Nice, typical Chinese restaurant.  Very clean, very quick and very nice.  I've been going to another Chinese takeout until recently when I gave New Asian a try.  I'm very glad that I did, I'd recommend this place to anyone.  I love the House Mei Fun, it's my fave..."}
{"text":"They are nice and the food was really good. You can see your meal made right in the lobby if you want. The place is kinda small and run by one family and it overall great for quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The food was very bland. Not seasoned at all. Referencing the General Tso Chicken, chicken lo mein, and ham fried rice."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Chinese takeout. My favorite dishes there are their steamed dumplings, beef with broccoli, and their chicken lo mein. It's really fast service and huge portions for low prices. The staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
