{"text":"One of the cleanest Restaurants I have ever been in. I even got to meet the brand new General Manager who just started at this Kings. Her name was Michelle, she was kind and very professional. You could tell she really loved her job. My waitress has been there 25 years , so I guess it must be a great place to work. I know it was a great place to eat."}
{"text":"It's a diner. Friendly waitresses, milkshakes, breakfast all day. Never had a bad experience at King's."}
{"text":"Friendly service.   After a bad experience with the service at Max and Erma's it was a nice change.  The food was quickly served and delicious."}
{"text":"I like King's I think maybe because I spent soo much time here as a kid.  I think they have a great breakfast and the prices are really cheap"}
{"text":"Outdated decor and low quality food. Service is very good, but I wouldn't go here for anything but breakfast. It's hard to mess up eggs and bacon. The quality of the food is so low I wouldn't eat any other meal here."}
{"text":"I live in Michigan so I only encounter kings when I visit family in Pennsylvania. In Michigan we have Coney Island it's a fast dinner with many options and cheap prices usually suggested for take out and not dine in. That's exactly what kings reminds me of. The atmosphere is fast and if u don't know what to order you might pick the wrong thing. Luckily my father brought me a breakfast sandwich so I know what to order. The waitress was great! Very attentive and friendly. I suggest getting breakfast from here even tho they have a large variety of other options :)"}
{"text":"Worked there for several months as a server, so I dont want to say too much but lets just say I agree with Stefanie B. (In a different review) on the cleanliness of the place, although they're getting better.. Also a lot of drugs moving between the staff, so not the best work environment.. but, the breakfast food is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Comfort food with lots of pie.  Huge menu and they serve breakfast all day.  They always have good beef vegetable soup. Huge parking lot.  Lots of older folks come here for reasonably priced, filling food with big portions."}
{"text":"Well just checked out of Hampton Inn and looking for a diner. We remember eating here a few yrs ago when in town. So we are here I between lunch and dinner to nice n quiet. Salad was fresh with homemade croutons even beet greens. Soup was hot n hearty beef barley. Skeleton crew on Sunday I guess not so busy. His meatloaf was good. I ordered pecan encrusted Talapia and I came out raw in middle. So I had to send it back. Bummer. But it was hot and crispy when I came back! My petite green beans were delish and real mashed potatoes.  Needed a little sweet finish so we split a piece of hot apple pie with \"cinnamon\" ice cream. Well the pie was mm good. No discount at end of bill..."}
{"text":"Dirt, filth, low quality food cooked by underpaid disgruntled employees, late night drunks, good ice cream.  All things one can expect from the Bridgeville King's.  I suppose if you are desperately hungry this place will do, but I really advise you to get back on I-79 and look for something better.  There's usually some road-kill and you can pull the marrow out of the bones to survive (thanks for that lesson Bear Grylls)."}
{"text":"I worked at Kings a number of years ago, not at this location though.  I really haven't gone to Kings since the ownership changed.  The smothered chicken is still the bomb, but it is really disappointing to see how much stuff has disappeared from their menu, especially the desert menu.  There are just a handful of items on it.  I went there specifically for cheesecake recently and was disappointed to find it no longer available.  The decor badly needs an update.  It's still looks the same as it did when they opened in in the late 80's/early 90's.  My boyfriend likes coming here, there is never a crowd, and in all honesty, I don't know how the place stays in business.  I went recently and got undercooked fish.  The manager was friendly and the fish was remade and taken off the bill."}
{"text":"This particular location is getting worse & worse since the takeover. The last visit here the waitress forgot our soups and salads. When we reminded the waitress of such she had to stop the manager from emptying the pots into the storage pots. The food was mediocre warm and we firmly believe everyone was in a hurry to vamoose bc the new closing hours are 9pm and it was 830p. Then to top it off we heard another customer complaining of cold food and when I went to use the restroom it was filthy. Both commodes were garbage bagged and there was feces on the toilet seat.  The district manager in his letter to my complaint didn't even acknowledge the feces."}
{"text":"While visiting Pittsburgh, my wife and I stopped at King's, primarily for a scoop of their red-hot cinnamon ice cream.  Sadly, Reinhold Ice Cream no longer produces the ice cream King's serves, and the new stuff tastes like it was once introduced to a red hot at a party five years ago.  Hard to argue with the prices: a cheese quesadilla is under $3.  And the \"Frownie\" mascot, an unhappy brownie, is also available for dessert, alone or as part of a sundae.  As Frownie says about being dismembered and devoured in the table card, \"That's cold.\"  The joke is funnier if you know that competitor Eat'n Park has a signature baked good, too, a \"Smiley\" cookie.  This location promises free wi-fi, but I had better luck with the drifitng signal from the motel next door."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I'm always a huge fan of potato pancakes.  Shout out to our server Mandi for great service.  However, I'm fully disappointed they took away the frowny brownie. It was by far the best reason to go there."}
{"text":"I remember the first Kings  restaurant where Hartley king had created a new chain of great food and great service.We were visiting Pittsburgh and stopped in this restaurant for breakfast. People were very friendly but the food was lousy. Bacon tasted old. My wife was served a spoiled avocado. They weren't very busy and the kitchen staff seemed apathetic. The service staff genuinely seem to care- too bad."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Not too sure what has happened to this place over the last few years but it is not good. Should have known something was off when it's Saturday 5pm and only 4 cars in parking lot. Service okay. Received a dirty mug for hot tea(like dirty you just rinsed the cup and soup was still stuck to the inside dirty). Took another 5 minutes to get a clean cup. Ordered the swiss mushroom burger. Got to play where's the mushrooms on my burger. Waiter noticed asked cook for more mushroom. The cook sent a whopping 5 pieces of mushroom on an oily plate. Meal cost $8.79 + tax. I got a single burger that was not 100% beef and a handful of fries. Not a good value at all."}
{"text":"Filth.  We went in here because it was conveniently located next to the hotel we were staying at. There was black mold in the ceiling. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls. Just all around nasty.  We found something caked on the back of a spoon - not sure what it was (seriously). We left a few bucks on the table and got out of there FAST. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"It's king's so you know what you are getting. It is a low priced diner/restaurant. Good breakfast served by older locals. Nice to see places like this still exist."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for the retirees. If you are not over 60 yrs old, I would not advise coming here. Everything screams elderly. The food is edible although nothing to brag about. The service was good. The restaurant was airy and not so clean. Come here if it is your only option, unless you are older and use to such an environment."}
{"text":"My first organized, real job was at a King's in Canonsburg. Sometimes I think that's the only reason I go there at all. My mom was a server there for 15 years and was fired for not wiping a wall down and thus lost her profit sharing, health care and ice cream discount. So that makes it harder even yet, to give them money.  But those damn cheese wedges and milkshakes, haha."}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee the other day while in Bridgeville.  King's is the King of reliability.  Waitress was polite.   But no food eaten."}
