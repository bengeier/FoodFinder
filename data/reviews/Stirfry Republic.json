{"text":"One of the best new restaurants we have been. Prices are reasonable, homemade sauces that have a ton of flavors, generous portion, and super friendly staff. The Sriracha Fries and the signature sauce for Stirfry are the must try!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great but the customer service was phenomenal!!! Definitely with trying! Shout out to the owner who remade my plate with different noodles since I did not like the ones I chose. I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The staff here is really nice and helpful and will answer any questions on the menu, this has been the first Mongolian restaurant I've been to that you don't get to pile on your veggies and meats so that makes for a different experience.

We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday and they had a few guest before us so it took about 10 minutes to get through the line to pay for our food, it took another 10-15 minutes for them to bring the food to our table. The food itself was hot but the beef on my was very chewy and tasted a little odd so I took it out and didn't eat it. 

Overall a good option for stirfry and I will return and try new sauces and proteins along with the wings that looked really good."}
{"text":"At the moment, this is my absolute FAVORITE place to eat...the service matches the quality of the food. The employees remember your name and make you feel special on each visit. I go to this place a few times a week and have not grown tired of eating here.

Now about the menu: they offer a variety of options..even for vegetarians like me. The fried tofu is amazing and although I haven't tried any of their meat selections, I'm pretty certain it is seasoned and grilled to perfection. The proportions are very filling and I always leave satisfied. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good stir fry...and it definitely helps that the prices are reasonable..10/10"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's family owned and you can tell they care.  Great atmosphere and food. You have to try the zucchini noodles and homemade ginger ale"}
{"text":"The service is great. Food is fresh made to order. Beautifully done modern atmosphere. And all the workers were very pleasant and welcoming. If you love fresh healthy food with a beautiful atmosphere... this place is the way to go!!!"}
{"text":"When I moved here a couple of weeks I immediately started looking for a Mongolian place to replace my favorite restaurant in Cali. I didn't find really any option but when I checked today I learned that this spot just opened up so I had to give it a try!

The restaurant is very nice, modern, urban with really cool graffiti art! So dope and creates a very chill and welcoming vibe. On the menu the dessert section is called Happy Endings 

It's different from other Mongolian places I'm used to where you make you're own bowl, I'm known to pile things really high. Lol I actually like this better where they make it for you and you build your own stir fry or soup. It's cleaner and feels WAYYYY more sanitary. 

I tried the stir-fry with the Spicy Korean sauce. I didn't expect the sauce to really impact the stir-fry because I'm used to watered down sauces but this had a lot of flavor and a huge spicy kick.  So yummy! Portion is big and just the right size.

Owners are friendly and are genuinely interested in your experience.

Overall it's hip, healthy and really flavorful!"}
{"text":"Omg best best mongolian grill ever!!
I got the signature sauce with fat noodles 
Omg this was the best choice
Good combo !

My husband got wide noodle w spicy korean sauce
This sauce is little spicy but if u like spicy
U should definitely get this one!

The interior is so clean and modern!!

I would definitely come back :)

Staffs are so nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Oh my god! My new favorite obsession!  The food was fresh, hot and quick! They have zucchini noodles which is fantastic if your a low carb person like me! I can't wait to go back! I would love it if they did a meal prep service!"}
{"text":"New, great place in town. The food is fresh and healthy! It's a family business and you can tell that they care a lot for every little detail. We will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I was going to take pictures, but it smelled so good I couldn't wait. 

I drive past the restaurant every day on my way to work, so I've been eagerly awaiting the reopening, as there aren't many great stir fry places here in town. I went with a friend and we each ordered a stir fry and we shared the sriracha fries and the dumplings. All of it was amaaaazing. The apps didn't last more than a minute, and we inhaled our noodles. 

In addition to the great food, the staff there is super nice. They explained the ordering process and helped us decide which noodles and sauces to use in our stir fry. They even let us taste all of the sauces to decide which one we wanted. 

Overall, awesome place and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were immediately greeted by the owner upon walking in the door. After his very nice greeting he explained the menu and how to order the ingredients. The concept is extremely cool you start with what type of noodles you enjoy. After the noodles they have an extensive array of veggies and fruits to add the the stir fry or soup. The soup is a Vietnamese Pho flavor. If you choose the stir fry they have amazing sauces ranging from sweet to spicy and combinations in between. At the end you choose which protein you want to add in. I had one of the best shrimp stir fries I have ever had in my life. The staff is extremely helpful and very genuinely nice always checking to make sure they made you an excellent stir fry. I also highly recommend the fresh homemade ginger ale and garlic edamame (the best I've had in town) our new favorite restaurant!! can't wait to come back and try more amazing combinations!!!"}
{"text":"Hey there, so I'm dropping 5 stars on this new food spot you must try out. It's right off the 215 on rainbow, super easy to get to and very visible, tall flags by the street. 
   First off, great customer service. Young energetic faces lit up the restaurant which is decorated with some great art work. 2 thumbs up to the artist, great work! Even the manager came out to check on the quality of my experience, handsome young fella with glasses. Thanks Mr. Manager, keep your staff running the way it is, postive 
   So from pictures I've seen, I first thought the portions were small. I noticed everyone didn't take advantage of the toppings list. I myself love veggies, so I pretty much put everything except pineapples in my stirfry. If your super picky with food and only eat a couple veggies, your missing out and can't expect a huge portion when, \"you don't eat your veggies?\" tsk* tsk*. 
   I noticed my plate was going to be big, so I held off from getting their homemade ginger ale, soda makes me full. && I was out in the sun carrying my backpack in the heat, so I went with powerade. Next time though, I'm getting one of their specialty drinks, they all sounded amazing. 
   When receiving my dish, it was a great serving size, I had the stirfry, with pretty much all the toppings like I said. Side of french fries with swag sauce and I asked for a side of the garlic chili oil. I didn't wait long at all before getting everything delivered to my table. I went to town on my food, I couldn't stop eating till I felt like I was going to pop. I finished maybe 2/3 of everything and packed the rest. The food tasted fresh, being cooked to order I didn't expect fresh to be a problem. Flavors were there, I had the signature sauce, it was a little more on the sweeter side. I'm not really a stirfry guy or sweet sauce person, but this place nailed it. Looking forward to trying their other options, sauces & drinks."}
{"text":"Reviewing this place before I even walk out of the restaurant after eating THATS how good it was. If I could rate more than 5 stars, I would. First time eating here and everything was amazing! It's basically a build your own stirfry noodle place. You pick a noodle style, veggies, protein and sauces then they stirfry it all together for you.  There's also an option of putting it all in a broth so it's like a ramen noodle soup. You can make it a meal for an extra $3, which includes their republic fries & special dipping sauce (bomb!) or the edamame which you can get plain or spicy garlic (the spicy garlic is killer) and a fountain drink. Everything tasted amazing. The ambience was super hip and trendy. This building sat vacant for a long time so I'm happy someone has taken it over and turned it into something wonderful. The customer service was outstanding. Spent some time speaking with Ann, Jackie (Jax) and a few others who informed me it's a family owned business which is always a major plus in my book. They were all so friendly. They offered a sample of their homemade ginger ale which was very refreshing; if you like ginger give it a try! I really can't say enough good things about this place. We will definitely be back no question."}
{"text":"First time trying this place out and it was amazing! Everyone was super friendly and knowledgeable. The combo is a great deal and you get a ton of food! We'll definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"This place is so good!!  We love spicy food and they were able to deliver with the spice (mild and no spice also available).  It's family owned and what a cool atmosphere!  Traveling through, but will def be back!"}
{"text":"Pack up your stuff & come get your food!

The food is amazing. The staff is amazing. I love this place. I think I found a new regular food spot.

It's basically the stir-fry version of Chipotle. You get to pick a number and start ordering. They offer five different noodle options including zoodles (super great for a healthier/vegetarian option). You travel through the process of picking veggies, protein, and sauce. I would list everything I opted-in for...but I pretty much jam packed my dish with every keto-friendly option I could get.

The cooking process was very quick and efficient. Everyone I had the chance to interact with was extremely pleasant and welcoming. That's not something you see every day and I definitely appreciate it. The staff even checked on us multiple times while we were eating (it's more of a grab and go place so that stood out a lot). 

There are great options aside from stir fry like garlic edamame, pot stickers, even sriracha fries! YUM. 

The great food, clean dining area, and amazing staff surely make StirFry Republic a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh food, if is your first time here they take their time explaining the menu and how to order. The service is fast, food excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love how you can create your own stirfry! My favorite flavor was the Spicy Korean Chili! Great food, great atmosphere, and great friendly staff! Bathroom entrance says \"Unloading Zone\" lmao"}
{"text":"First time here - really really good. I'll be a regular. The Spicy sauce is no joke. Be careful!!!

Everything is super fresh the staff are friendly and fast and the restaurant is clean and new."}
{"text":"Amazing family atmosphere with great food. Six different noodles all the veggies you can think of, steak, chicken, pork or shrimp and for two buck more double meat. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Kick ass flavor ! This is a must try! Easy order process, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff! Garlic edamame was on point! Spicy korean wings are super crisp! Not to mention you can create your own pho!! Very inexpensive and great for kids too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way through town. Service was amazing, fun concept, but most of all great food! Tried several different things, they were all good. Housemade ginger ale was SO good. I highly recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Stirfry Republic has a very friendly and helpful staff. 
However, the stirfry was unlike standard Mongolian experiences. The staff added the amounts of ingredients, not you. The sauces; which are the foundation of the MBBQ, was IMHO not that tasty. 
My Stirfry returned over-cooked, the noodles were mushy and the fiery schezwan was not tasty. It was basically mush in a bowl."}
{"text":"I can't recommend this place enough!  Great selection of fresh food,  good service, great side dishes, and even awesome desserts. The freshly brewed thai tea was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we thought it was very good.  I got the stir fry with beef and shrimp and teryaki chicken kids meal.  I love getting all the veggies I like.  The kids meal was very filling for a child.  It came out nice and hot and tasted very good.  It did take some time to come out which was strange because there was no one else here.  Maybe they need to work out some kinks because they just opened.  It was a bit pricey but for freshly cooked food its worth it.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am overjoyed that they have finally opened their doors to us. They are family owned and have a loving welcoming vibe! I've spent years desperately waiting for a Mongolian BBQ spot to come to town that really hits my soul and they have done it. They have great portions and dam good prices! The bowls are good sized and they have a setup some what like a chipotle or café rio. Very clean and sanitary and they take pride in making sure you are satisfied. All the staff are phenomenal! I will definitely be back again and again"}
{"text":"Walked in 20 mins before closing and the whole team was super eager to serve us and let us sample all of their sauces! They gave great recommendations and walked us through the entire menu. The food is absolutely delicious and plentiful.  We will be back! Try them out!"}
{"text":"I have a seafood allergy and they were so accommodating! They have a wok in the back to cook everything in away from any seafood on their regular cooking surfaces. 

Everything was super delicious
I had their Signature Sauce, Flat Noodles, Bean Sprouts, Bok Choy, Broccoli, Carrots, Eggs, Edamame, Garlic, Ginger, Green Onions, Water Chestnuts, Zucchini, Beef, and Rice. 
We also tried their wings and their fries. All were delicious!"}
{"text":"Located in a lot with plenty of parking available. Has a very chic exterior and interior is spacious with tons of seating! Super cool wall art with graffitied words to show where the restrooms are as well as trash area. Quite an interesting concept that you can build your own stirfry! Choose between soup or stirfry with a decent variety of noodles available. Add-ons aren't anything special as it would be what you would expect in a typical stirfry, except you can choose what you want or don't want specifically. Order what you want at ease! Except while ordering I noticed the guy seemed to passive aggressively limit my options as he kept trying to move to the next set of add ons, no biggie though but he also put in green onions into the bowl when I haven't asked for it (yet) but still, he added an ingredient that wasn't requested for. Also ordered a chow mein kids meal for my brother which comes with two sides of veggies--with that being broccoli and carrots. While ordering from the beginning we learned that they were out of carrots. So naturally, I assumed another veggie choice would've been opted for to compensate for the missing side but it was not. Finished product-wise, I thoroughly enjoyed the honey sriracha sauce. There were unsupervised kids kicking a ball around the lobby, whom I'm assuming are the kids of the employees. They weren't being overly obnoxious but I do feel perhaps they should have a closer eye on them as they were touching utensils (placing forks fallen on the table back into the dispenser) and things in the self serve area."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW!!!  UPDATES ARE IN CAPS!

Ok, so it's pretty good!  Couple little things will push this review higher. If you're the owner and you see this, I promise, you can earn those extra stars easily. THEY DID!!  The food was tasty. The service was great. The decor is modern and cool. Here's what you need to get those stars up. 

1.  Add fresh garlic, shallots, ginger and herbs. Adds a lot of flavor to an Asian stir fry.  THEY DID THIS!!!  I ADDED CILANTRO AND GARLIC!!!  HUGE FLAVOR IMPROVEMENT!!!

2.  Don't run out of stuff on your second day....or ever. EVERYTHING WAS AVAILABLE!!

3. The grill needs to be hotter to sear the noodles and veggies. The medium heat only makes it all kinda mushy. Cook the protein on the side and add the sauce at the end.  Yummy crunchy stir fry. No mushy noodles. HUGE IMPROVEMENTS!!  DELICIOUS CRUNCH!!  

Besides that, it's a great concept. We will be back to see if it improves!  IT DID!  RECOMMEND HIGHLY!!!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place where you can customize your own stir fry! Love all the different options of noodles, veggies and sauces! I had a mix of the zoo dle(zucchini noodles) and skinny noodles, various veggies, chicken and their signature sauce. It was so fresh and yummy!!! Will definitely be back to try a different combination!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot. We happened to see the place when we were driving by. How fun. We got to create our own dishes. I enjoyed being able to mix sauces to create a perfect mix. Service was amazing. The fries and dip. Next level. Will be back for sure! So awesome!"}
{"text":"If you've been craving good Mongolian BBQ and you like family owned business, eat here now! The staff is full of smiling personable people that genuinly care about creating a personalized experience. We had a few stir frys, Sriracha fries, wings and potstickers. All were served piping hot and tasted great! The price is unbelievable too. Will definitely be telling people about it and coming back soon. Yum!"}
{"text":"My dad, who is a total foodie, was raving about this place, but when he took me to lunch we found out it was going to re-open in a few weeks. We went back, this time with a lot of friends, and it totally lived up to my dad's ravings. It's like Cafe Rio but for stir fry, but with more options and lots of veggies. I'm a vegetarian, but I don't like tofu. So instead, they offered to put way more veggies in it- which is so awesome. I usually feel ripped off as a vegetarian when I go to places like this and look for non-meat options. But not here!! They gave so much food, the service was great, and the options are endless. Can't wait to go back to try another sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food! Cool vibe! Glad this place is close to home :) whoever did the artwork in here killed it. Asian mixed with Urban. Dizzzope!"}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed this place. The staff was friendly and they definitely explained everything to you if you have never been there yet. The price is affordable for the amount you get, I believe my bowl was $8.99. I got the double beef bowl, stir fry chow noodles as my base. You get to add your own vegetables. As far as flavor, I was able to do a combination of sweet Korean chili along with the fiery schezwan. I would definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"I work at the rehab nearby and have been waiting for them to open so I can try it out. It's comparable to a chipotle for stir-fry type of setting but the food is much better a healthier option, great prices, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I will recommend to everyone I know."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience! 
So pleasantly surprised to find a lunch spot doing it RIGHT!!! 

From the moment we walked in the door, we felt welcomed and taken care of. We ordered 2 stir fry, easy process through the line and being that it was our first time here, we were thankful for helpful servers. I wound up making a good call on my sauce choice thanks to the guy working behind the counter. 

Our food was beautifully served to our table, very flavorful and perfectly portioned. The best part was that the staff (owners?) each individually came by our table and all other tables as well, to check up on how we liked the food. They were very personable and genuine people. We loved the food! We loved the service! That personal touch will keep us coming back here! 

Thank you Stir Fry Republic for such an awesome lunch! We will let everyone know about this great find. Blessings for all your future success, you clearly deserve it!"}
{"text":"After a coworker had his for lunch I had to come in and try cause it smelled so good! Super fun to do, everything is diy and you choose what you want. Their fries are super awesome and the mango lassi is to die for!! Will definitely be coming back."}
