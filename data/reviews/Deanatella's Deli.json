{"text":"Stuffed pepper sub is AMAZING! Tuna sub, meatball sub, Italians sub (if they ask you \"with or without\" definitely answer \"with\"- this means with muffuletta), pizza by the slice, fresh bread, everything is good."}
{"text":"I wish I would have found this place sooner.  It is a tiny Italian take out place that had a line out the door at lunch.  While contemplating the menu, a cook (the owner?) suggested the fresh eggplant.  The sandwich was amazing.  Easily a foot long, on a homemade bun.  I've heard the Sausage sandwich with peppers and onions is amazing too.  I think it was about $6.50 and I could have saved half for dinner.  Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The best Italian sub there is, there was, or ever will be !! Nice little spot to eat outside too with tables, chairs, umbrellas and music. Love this place !!"}
{"text":"The stuffed pepper subs here are to die for! The only thing to be aware of is the Hots are hot.... So don't have too much gusto if you aren't into hot food. There is nothing wrong with getting the mild. Pizza is a great choice also. Great food for the money. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great lunch at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. In and out fast. Awesome specials. Great pizza & the  italian \"with\" sub is delicious.  BEST place to go in Valley view!"}
{"text":"Been going here for several years for the white cheese pizza during Lent, sure beats fish or pierogis.  Great garlic flavor.  The other pizzas are fabulous too!!  Ordered a party tray for a large party.  The food was super fresh, well made, and there was plenty for all.  Very reasonably priced too!  Try one some time, I'm sure you'll be as pleased as I was!"}
{"text":"Friendly spot for takeout and a handful of classic Italian sandwiches. By all accounts, a better option than the neighboring Subway franchise."}
{"text":"Legit Italian place. Great sandwiches, pastas and pizza. Try their stuffed hot peppers too. If you go to subway next door then you have a problem."}
{"text":"the food is fantastic, I love the patio, I hear they will have live music Wed & Fri this summer and the owner is so cute !"}
{"text":"Went here for first time. My work moved to a new location and I wanted to find a new pizza place for lunch. Great pizza! I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Very good italian subs.  As others have said, if you like hot stuffed peppers, then the stuffed pepper sub is fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a true Italian Deli! I'm not kidding, his Mother works at the deli and makes the bread fresh. Her Sicilian Tuna is to die for. The meatball Sub Sandwiche will feed a family of 4 with no problem. He has stuffed peppers that can be a appitizer or made into a sandwiche. He has Espresso, Homemade soups and salads. Chicken Parmesaen Sandwiche can not be overlooked. Now I save the best for last.....PIZZA!!!!!!!!!!!!! The best Pizza in town! by the slice to Sheet!"}
{"text":"Had the Italian sub and my dad had the sausage sub. Bread is made fresh daily. Friendly service family owned and run. Both sandwiches were fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place for a quick take out lunch. The veggie pizza is divinely spiced with plenty of garlic, oregano and basil. The crust is pretty thick, which I'm not a huge fan of, but this pizza is still one of my faves.   They have outdoor seating but when I've had time to sit outside its been packed. I guess we all had the same idea on nice days."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch place. Carryout or eat on their patio.  They typically have 5 types of pizza by the slice and cold Italian subs ready to go if you are in a hurry. You can also call in orders, or just order at the counter and wait.  The pizza is thick square cut. The white is very garlicky and comes plain or with artichokes and roasted peppers. The red pizzas are cheese, pepperoni, and sausage.  The hot subs are huge, stuffed with cheese, garlic, and sauce. Then baked in the pizza oven. My personal favorite it the stuffed hot pepper sub. Their sausage is excellent too.  The cold subs are good too. Great bread.  They also have salads, deli items like olives and stuffed peppers. And in the colder months they have soup"}
{"text":"One of the best delis in Cleveland! Run by \"Guy\" Deanatella and his family (his mother is adorable and makes fantastic soup from scratch), this place has awesome sub sandwiches. $7.50 gets you a sub that can feed two people, and the ingredients are top-notch. Some are cold, like the Italian sub (get the olive spread), and the warm subs are made and then roasted in the pizza oven for 10 minutes or so, getting them piping hot. The hot pepper sub, made with banana peppers stuffed with spicy sausage, is really tasty and will get you sweating - they have a mild version too. The pizza is also great - try the artichoke white, there's nothing else like it in the city."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place hasn't been reviewed before because it's incredible. It's in a tiny shopping plaza next to Subway and somehow people walk past it to go to there. If they only had a clue. There's not much to the place - just a beatup screen door on the front and one tiny little table inside. It's meant to be takeout and it's a deli setup.  Anyway - the food is authentic Italian and you really need to try it. I get an Italian sub pretty much every time with this awesome olive spread on it. The bread is fresh-baked and honestly, that's what makes the sandwich. I mean fresh like you can eat a loaf of it with just a little oil and seasonings.   They also have awesome pizza. It's just by the slice and sitting right out on the counter above where they have all their deli and side items. You won't be able to eat it all, but grab a slice or two there as well. It's a little heavier though. The dough is great and fluffy, but you seriously will be pretty close to full after one piece. While I'm not a picky eater at all, I'd say stick to the traditional pizza. Some of the weird stuff (broccoli, artichoke...etc.) sounds or look good, but I wasn't a fan.   Reasonably priced place. If I get a sub, I'll probably grab two huge pieces of pizza for later too and it's under $10. It's a really, really unassuming place so when you see the Subway, you're there. But if you go into Subway and pass this place up (even if there's a line) you'll have no clue what you're missing."}
{"text":"My dad actually somehow found this place and treated me to lunch on the way home from the airport. I would have never found it otherwise; thanks Dad!  We shared one hot pepper sub and it was more than enough food. Deliciously spicy, saucy, with the right amount of cheese (read: a lot) and served on pillowy yet crusty fresh bread.  Didn't try the pizza but the slices looked substantial and tasty.  If the weather cooperates, definitely sit on their cute little patio! The interior doesn't have much seating or ambiance, but the patio is really nice and has Italian music playing."}
{"text":"Love it. Great subs...I mean great.  Owner, owner's mom and staff are unbelievably friendly and they can cook!"}
{"text":"Oh yes it's that good.. Real deal italian subs! All sliced right there... Pizza is amazing and everything is homemade. Awesome lunch spot"}
{"text":"Great little place. No seating available (just 1 table with 2 chairs), but very good sandwiches!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for lunch. Great friendly people. Hot pepper sub is the best, but all the subs are great. Never disappointed, unless I get there and they are closed."}
