{"text":"Best Chinese buffet on the east side of Cleveland! Selection of non-traditional items was a nice change. Very clean. Food was fresh and constantly refilled. $10.99 for dinner was more than fair."}
{"text":"Huge clean place. Service was attentive. Surprised at all the seafood offerings. The little fried flounder squares were tasty. They had crawdads (crayfish ?) Huge whole fried shrimp (?) Regular American fantail fried shrimp.  Real chocolate cake slices and pumpkin pie also. Real not ersatz. The make it up yourself noodle get bar had a lot on it."}
{"text":"Fuji Buffet became my favorite Chinese buffet the first time I stopped in! Their selection of foods and sushi are fantastic and fresh. The only 'problem' is trying to stop myself from getting another plate! Also, on the cleanliness side, my wife Hs finally found a Chinese buffet she is willing to enjoy as a family for dinner!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese buffet that I've ever been to. Everything is fresh, clean and tastes good.  Even the lo mein noodles and broccoli  from the chicken and broccoli dish were cooked well (I had two servings of these to be sure).  I didn't try the hibachi or sushi but it looked good. The salad bar had all the essentials and was clean. The pumpkin pie and hard packed ice cream for dessert were tops."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in as many days.  The only other place I do that is Taco Bell, which normally I'd be ashamed to admit but you people don't know who I am, so...  Here's why I liked it:   Lunch, $7.99.  All you can eat sushi- and other things.  I can eat 10 full plates of sushi.  They know this about me- NOW!  I went to the sushi bar and yelled, \"Fugu!\"  The guy making the sushi said about me, \"Tou shi kong kong de!\" My genius, well educated brain knew this language to be Spanish and translated it to \"Handsome white guy.\"  Kids meals are different prices.  I brought my 6 and 9 y/o.  They were like $5.50 and $6.50.  Fuji's loss.  My 6 y/o girl out ate us all-  She must be part Chinese.  Those skinny folks can eat! I know because I've supped on many a plate of nachos with them.  As far as the \"other\" food items go, for yall's that ain't into sooshi, they have an island of salad, including peel n' eat shrimp, an island of Chinese favorites like Gen Tso's Chix and Kung Pao, an island of seafood like coconut shrimp, clams and baked crab, an island of Americana with mac n' cheese, chicken nuggs, cheese pizza, an island of fried Chinese favorites like egg rolls, pot stickers and cho-nuts, a desert island, an ice cream cooler- not soft serve, a fruit island and a Mongolian BBQ.  If you read all that, it would have been quicker just to go.  Now to the atmosphere:  Restaurant- Nice and clean, very friendly staff.  Clientele- it's ok to wear your pajamas, but there's a 12\" a** crack max."}
{"text":"I tried the new buffet for the first time over the weekend.  Most of the food was delicious.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the selection at the hibachi table.  The meat types weren't marked so you don't necessarily know what you are taking.  The vegetable selection is limited.  I ended up with a plate if noodles, a bit of broccoli, bell pepper, and a few shrimp.  This is not my preference when it comes to hibachi.  The staff was very attentive."}
{"text":"I love Fuji buffet, food is delicious and fresh, I ate here a few times, but they had poor sanitary condition, the tables and desks are so stick, bathroom are also disgusting toilet paper are all over the place. Usher who wear glasses and the cashier's attitude was so bad."}
{"text":"This place inhabites the space once filled by Hometown Buffet. The space is vast. The place is clean the service is prompt. But the most significant thing about Fuji Buffet is the diversity of food that is on offer. You can get westernized Chinese fare like General Tso's Chicken and Crab Ragoon... you can get seafood including clams crawfish and salmon... or you could get traditional American Food Like Pork Chops and a Baked Potato."}
{"text":"We have always got our money's worth at Fuji ever since they opened a few months ago. We have been here about 8 times and have never been disappointed until tonight. The restaurant offered a Christmas special for a higher price of about $14.00 which included an all you can eat snow crab. We did not expect large snow crab, but almost no crab was unexceptable. The majority of our meal was spent waiting for a few pieces of crab to be put out. The line would grow until 8 or 10 people would form, then about every 20 minutes they would come out with a small pan of crab legs that only about 4 or 6 people would finish off and then it was another 20 minute wait. There typical chinese buffet food is good and about equal to the better buffets. Their desserts and ice creme is the same disgusting artificial stuff you get in every chinese buffet. Tasteless, dry, bland cakes and cookies with artificial ice cream.  I would recommend going to Fuji for lunch or maybe an occasional dinner, but would recommend that it be avoided for their holiday all you can eat crab specials which will disappoint and frustrate you. I wouldn't be surprised if they are sued for a bait and switch scheme. It certainly wasn't all you can eat and a lot of people were very angry."}
{"text":"Fugi is the best Japanese / Chinese buffet in Lake County.  I use to work on the west side where there is another Fugi in Parma by the same owner.  I was so excited when I found out they were opening up in Lake County.  Prices are reasonable, the food is fresh and plenty of choices.  There are other Chinese buffets in Lake County but none that can compare with the great taste and quality that Fugi has to offer."}
{"text":"Delicious!   Wide array of soups, miso, chowder, egg drop, wonton - tons of sushi - even octopus - and a hibachi station.  Hubby did all the sushi and stayed off the mains - he said it was delicious. I went mains.   The choices will blow your mind and fit your appetite at the same time.  A fruit and salad bar, fresh fruit, cottage cheese, tomato cucumber salad, jello etc.  A typical Chinese food bar fried rice, lo mein, general tso, pepper and steak, seafood delight, coconut shrimp, prawns, some lesser adventurous Chinese food bar - sweet and sour chicken, chicken and broccoli, egg rolls, crab Rangoon and donuts, a kid/\"American\" food bar (which the kids loved the Mac n cheese, nuggets, and apple pie hot pastry), and some delicious dessert options.   Ice cream (8 tubs) which you self scoop is my four star - yes at a buffet you see some things ppl do and think - you know you're in public right? This for me happened watching people scoop ice cream (with also the smallest scoop I have ever seen going down into a full cooler) - especially young patrons.  There's one scoop - 8 tubs and the scoops wash water doesn't have time to keep up.  Totally not this places fault - just makes for a  moment.   Will def be back - kids eat free until age 2 so with the picky eating twins we have to use that before they turn 2!"}
{"text":"Well tried them out today i was pretty impressed the variety and cross cultured food choices are a nice change, i just wish their Chinese food choices were not the same as every other China buffet. But all the other items help ease the fact that section is typical. The fresh sushi being made for you to see is assuring and the cook to order selection is bigger then most others that offer the hibachi cooking. I hope they dabble with different food items so it is not 365 days of the same items if they change things up i can see it being around a very long time."}
{"text":"Good buffet with large selection. Would say this is the best Chinese buffet all Cleveland and lake county area. I've tried them all. Price is very cheap for the selection."}
{"text":"Brest place loads of choices.plAce is clean and inviting.the choices are endless something for everyone. Sushi was fresh and well presented. The hibachi grill was clean and well ran bring you appetite and it's not a bank buster 15.00 and you will leave stuffed to the brim and happy will go back"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go with my family. The variety is great, the food is always hot/fresh and never greasy.. There's an entire salad AND fruit aisle, parallel the dessert aisle. The sushi counter has an amazing range of different freshly made sushi. I tried eel roll here for the first time in my life and I've been eating it ever since. I've never tried the soups, but there are several soups out with crackers and soup cups. Then the regular aisles- rice, noodles, chicken and broccoli, bourbon chicken, pepper steak, etc.. pizza, fries, chicken nuggets, egg rolls, fried catfish, crab Rangoon, Mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, gravy, creamed spinach.. So many options. The pizza and Mac & cheese are the only American dishes I eat there and they're fantastic. The chocolate cake and cheesecake are the best dessert options, along with some \"puppy chow\" by the ice cream area.   Definitely worth the price of $10.99 adult + $2.00 drink."}
{"text":"nice to see a quality food buffet open here. also serving American foods, sushi & hibachi along with 4 soups. the slabs bar was excellent and all the stations were clean - well stocked and a ton of selections. servers cleared plates quickly! don't forget to tip!!!  only issue was the families letting their kids run around like it was a playground."}
{"text":"I don't think a Asian buffet could ever be five stars but what I will say is that this spot is a top ranking Asian buffet. It was clean it was organized the buffet was always stocked. These are simple things that you should expect but you know how that can go. I went for Mother's Day and it was pretty packed but things still went smoothly ran smoothly and the line moved quick for getting in. They even have really good sushi and not just California roll. They had some of my favorite eel rolls and spicy salmon or spicy tuna I would definitely recommend this Buffet if you want to go to an Asian buffet"}
{"text":"Got here for lunch at opening so everything fresh and delicious!  The surroundings are upscale and clean with a combo of booths and tables.  The salad bar is a real treat with three types of lettuce and many toppings. There is a sushi bar, fresh fruit and pudding, desserts such as pumpkin and lemon meringue pie and bite size items for tasting. Plenty of soups and my clam chowder was the best I've ever had. Items that stood out for me were the meatloaf, garlic green beans, red skins, salmon.  In the chinese line, they picked the most popular items and feature them. Seafood lovers will be quite happy here!  Take the family..or a friend who won't judge."}
{"text":"I came here with my family (spouses and children included), over 20 of us. My father made a reservation and our table was set up right when we got there. This place is huge and great for large groups as there are plenty of seating. The staff is very friendly. Our waitress was very interactive with us, including the kids. She did a great job keeping our drinks filled, clearing the table, while taking care of other tables as well. On to the good stuff..the food...holy yum! There are so many options!! Like it seemed like it would never end! Everything is hot and fresh, constantly being refilled. This place was busy but everything stayed stocked.  There is a very nice salad bar with crisp fresh lettuce and tons of toppings, pasta salads, jello, pudding, fresh fruit. There is a dessert station, sushi station and hibachi where they cook up your items fresh in front of you. There are endless options of entree foods. Fried rice noodles honey chicken broccoli and chicken Japanese chicken, just to name a few.  My favorite part was the seafood. I'm still licking my chops. Fried shrimp and fried flounder were awesome! Flounder was tender and juicy. My top favs were the stuffed salmon, swai fillet, and coconut shrimp. I want some now please.  There are American options like pizza chicken nuggets mashed potatoes sweet corn sliced yams ribs and so on.  There is also a soup station with options like clam chowder miso soup wonton soup and egg drop. Next to it is the ice cream with toppings. Some cartons were pretty empty so I didn't get much of my cookies and cream ice cream.  I have not listed even half of what's offered. The price can't be beat for the amount of food offered.  This place is awesome. I have to say I am not a fan of buffets. I usually have bad experiences. But this place changed my thoughts. Everything is hot fresh yummy and clean. I hope this place stays and keeps up the great work.  Just come here."}
{"text":"Place was freaking awesome. All you can eat Chinese food... Freaking delicious. Especially the damn sushi it was very flavor packed. The orange chicken awesome. It was all around a awesome experience"}
{"text":"Great selection and variety of foods here! I love this place. There is American food served here as well as Japanese great place for picky people or for indecisive people. Can get a little crowded though."}
{"text":"Great new Chinese buffet, probably the best I've been to outside of Vegas. Soups, seafood, hibachi, the list goes on and on. I was shocked to see how many choices... I will be back again"}
{"text":"The buffet is really clean, has good waiters and waitresses to help you out at all time when you need and the food is great."}
{"text":"Come here. You won't regret it. Excellent selection and great service. Have been here twice. Now on our list of repeat restaurants"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better buffets in the area. Lots of variety and the crowd of people says it all."}
{"text":"Pro's: Clean place Good food Large variety (American,Chinese,Sushi and stir fry) Decent Deserts (Various cakes,seasonal pies,ice cream,Jello,cookies,etc)  Con's: Seating can be a little crowded during dinner time Dinner time price is a little pricey Sometimes you may be waiting a while to get a table for anything over party of 4.  Personally It's good for a 1-2 times a month experience."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here for the first time today.  Food pretty decent overall, except I didnt care for any of the soups I tried.  The clam chowder tasted like plaster and the hot and spicy was cold and tasteless-watery.  I had hoped for more selection.  Someone told me this was touted the best in Ohio.  Doubtful.   Food overall decent.  Decent table runners.  Nothing special here.   I wonder if there are more or different selections for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! We eat here often! I absolutely love the hibachi. Plenty of veggie options."}
{"text":"It's a very good buffet, but I can't get crazy with the stars because it is still a buffet. You can get a plate of fresh rolled sushi, nice selection of sashimi and maki rolls. You can wait a little longer for the hibachi station where you prepare of bowl of ingredients that are cooked on skillet while you wait. Or you can peruse the 5 other counters. I had oysters (not great but still oysters), peel and eat shrimp (again not great but still shrimp), and about a dozen other seafood options. Many I liked. There is American fare like roast beef, chicken wings, nuggets, and mac & cheese as well. The fried fish was really good. There is an ice cream counter. There is a soup counter with miso, hot & sour, and wonton next to clam chowder. So, a little weird but definitely worth the $11 (I had a $2 off coupon as well). If I were a kid my parents would have taken me here a lot as it is cheaper for kids. You pay as you go in, the line moves quickly. And the girls come by to refill drinks frequently and bus dirty plates. So, well run, lots of options, sushi was fresh, but being a buffet you know many things have been sitting a while and have been rummaged through, so manage your expectations and you will be stuffed to the gills when you saunter out to car, go home, and lay on couch for three hours wondering why you keep doing this to yourself like I did."}
{"text":"You looking for a good place for date night?  Because this place is full of sensuous charm.  They'll play the Karate Kid soundtrack while you and your beloved stuff your fat faces.  Otherwise there's a no signature needed divorce place nearby and you can come here afterward to eat your emotions...   Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Best buffet for the price I've EVER had, hands down. $11 dinner and they had sushi and sashimi. How do they make money off this? Maybe Ohio people don't eat lots of seafood. Clean, friendly, good atmosphere. Wish I could put this place in my suitcase and take it with me!"}
{"text":"I planned a retirement lunch for a co-worker and decided to go with this buffet. I had a party of about 40 and called to make a reservation two days prior. It went pretty smoothly despite a bit of a language barrier. The staff was pleasant and accomodating. There are many options at the buffet. All the meat was separated from the noodles, so it's vegetarian friendly. There is a sushi bar and also a soup bar. I don't really care for buffets because I find them to be gross, but this place was very clean. Some of the patrons were the typical avid buffet visiting type. Just try to avert your eyes and enjoy your food. Overall it was decent and it's fairly painless if you have a large group."}
{"text":"Best Chinese buffet in the area. Very clean. Great selection of food. Great sushi. Great soups. Everything was hot and fresh. Service was great. We went for dinner only 10.99 wow what a value for all this great food. You have to try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed Fuji buffet! The place seemed really clean. There were really so many choices including several buffets, a Mongolian grill or whatever it is called where you get a bowl of foods and then they cook them for you. They even have a lot of seafood and crayfish and sushi, like 4 or 5 soups. Lotsa stuff! Staff is very nice. Great place - nice job.  Of course it is a buffet and you should not go cause then you eat too much and then feel terrible but it's fun sometimes. If you are gonna do the buffet thing - it might as well be here."}
{"text":"The best buffet I have ever been to. Simply amazing sits in the old home town buffet. Huge buffet tables full of choices with a full habachi table and sushi bar and soup bar with all popular Asian soups. I'm thinking the items on the buffet are subject to change I thought I saw crab legs as a option but they were not out tonight but I got my full on clams and mussles which were amazing there were also crawfish available too as well as ribs. There is a sushi bar with alot of options to choose from all were very tasty as well as huge salad bar and dessert bar. You will not go hungry here we ate so much we thought we would end up in a food coma lol very fun and highly recommend."}
