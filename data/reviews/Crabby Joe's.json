{"text":"Were shown to our table and then immediately forgotten about. It took almost twenty minutes before our drinks order was finally taken. I was practically spitting feathers by the time our waiter decided we were worthy of her service.  By the time my pint eventually arrived, I was unsure whether to drink it or frame it. 
Our food was adequate, but our waiter's apparent fondness for everything we ordered (like we were ordering all her favourites...what were the chances!) was a bit false and grating. 
It wasn't only the waitress who had some failings (add her inability to keep us supplied with drinks to the list), but the bar staff seemed to struggle too. My better half asked for something with cherry liqueur. She got blackcurrant. 
Maybe if the staff paid more attention to the clientele instead of chatting amongst themselves then the place may improve."}
{"text":"We decided to drive into Bolton for the chicken quesadilla and Bora Bora salad which we love!!! Guess what they changed their menu and the salad wasn't on it!!! Why do restaurants do this!!! It's always the good shit they change!! Stop doing that!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a hand full of times. When it first opened the food was good.  Then it was down hill from there.  I won't go into all the details but one time there was a hair in my salad, I got my meal free but I had no more appetite.  I wrote a huge blog about it.  Then I went back about six months later, let's just say I left hungry.  The only good thing about this place is service is fast and it is good for kids."}
{"text":"I go to Crabby's all the time. The food is good and the service is decent. They are very consistent with their food, you always get exactly what you order. The bar tenders and bar staff are more attentive than the staff in the during room I find.

It's a great place to go for sports events if you want a pretty large screen and a more intimate space than large sports bars. 

I always find that the place is clean which is also great."}
{"text":"I went for there wing special. I bought the poutine and wings. The cheeses was half frozen causing the whole dish to be cool. The wings were nothing great, I found them very unflavoured."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and Mother in law on Thanksgiving Sunday evening for dinner. The place was deserted with very few tables occupied. Took long time to get any service, finally waitress came and took our orders. I ordered the fish and chips, wife ordered a salad, and mother in law the blackened halibut. Fish and chips were ok, but tasted like the fish was frozen. Wife had ordered a main salad but got a small side salad, when she told the waitress, she took it back and seems to have tossed it on to a larger plate, added some greens and brought it back whereby the chicken was now cold. Mother in laws meal was really bad. Fish was previously frozen, and tasted like it had just been warmed up, the meal was supposed to come with veggies but they were forgotten, when asked was told they would get some, and a few mins later received some in a bowl right from a microwave. They were disgusting. Mother in law ate very little of her meal. Complained and did get the meal taken off the bill. But will not be going back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not sure how long they were open before they lost their liquor licence a few months ago......but that was a minus for me from the start. When i did finally go in, I ordered one of their burgers............oh what a mistake that was. The burger tasted like it was sitting under a warming lamp for a few hours and then quickly re-heated.....it was drier then toast. I then looked at the kitchen staff (there's a clear window to the back) and from what i saw i wasn't surprised anymore.........it looked like teens were manning the kitchen.......not to say that teens can't cook.........but these guys obviously lacked any culinary skills (not that you need much skill to cook a burger) I think anyone that goes there should just stick to the beer and wings, that's what i'm going to do........i don't think anyone can screw that up.............."}
{"text":"We have been to Crabby Joe's numerous times and we're always pleased with the food. The lunch menu is great, we love the prosciutto pasta that is featured on it. The pad Thai is delicious. The low calorie menu is varied and amazing. The cocktails are always refreshing and delicious. We find that the prices are altogether very reasonable (actually, we always end up saying how cheap our bill is and how fresh, beautiful and delicious our meals were.) We have had excellent service each time we visited. Angus needed a place like this!"}
{"text":"Took my two year old son for his birthday..and was very pleased! The menu had a different selection than most restaurants around here which was a nice change, the prices were good, the food was excellent and the waitress was very good too! We went on a Sunday so it was also kids eat free which was a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Old review below- 

Update after eating dinner.

So, I tried to give credit for being new. However, receiving our food 45 minutes later, the wings were dry. The burgers were burnt, the pasta was cold, the fries were saugee, and we had to ask 4 people for refills.

This is truly unacceptable from a service standpoint and also a food quality point of view.

PERSONALLY, I RECOMMEND AVOIDING THIS RESTAURANT.





I need to give them credit for opening a new restaurant. However, after a month you think they would have figured their table locations out and general service. It is slow. They mix tables up, the waiters don't know what's on tap and they are extremely slow.

I do respect it's new. But I think there would be managers around and employees who are experienced to make sure they figure it our and smooth out their process. 

On the plus side, the food is good, the employees are friendly and the overall building is pleasant. It's a nice addition to Angus.

Here's to hoping for success!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time, honestly expected some crab to be on the menu, the manager seemed completely surprised that I asked if there was any crab on the menu. There is none. That said, enjoyed the rib wing combo, server was very nice, and there's a good beer selection too. Prices are OK but not value oriented, but regardless will return as it was a nice experience, the restaurant decor is nice and there are screens in the lounge bar area if you want sports."}
{"text":"Nice waitress (Nicole) crappy food. Slow. Rotten veggies in stir fry. Limp oily chips. Cold spinach dip. Won't go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the wings at this place ... can't beat the price either on Tuesdays ... 29cent wings!! The service is usually very good, their Nachos are also excellent.  Their Cheese Fries are also awesome.  All in all, we really like the food there. Portions are great, prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Not busy at lunch on Monday.  Food was hot, fresh and fast. They offer WiFi which I found easy to access. Order from the lunch menu on the first page a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Went during wing deal. Wings were very tasty. Could not finish them all and server let us take the rest home despite restaurant policy. Very happy with service and food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"So far this is the first visit that we weren't waiting to order or be seated. We will see how the rest of the meal goes..."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. Try flatbread.

 Wifi  does not work properly for the last one year. Whats the point having Wifi and tell the customer: \"most of the time, it does not work\""}
{"text":"Worst wings I've ever had quesadilla was soggy and the flavours weren't very great there was also a hair in it we also waited for over 40 minutes to get our drinks as well as an hour and thirty on top of that for the food... Never again"}
{"text":"Crabby Joe's is my regular spot for after work drinks and quick bites.  A big factor working in it's favour is the fact that it's the closest licensed establishment to my home, my local grocery store and of course the biggest one...it's on my way home from the office.

The atmosphere is bright, the bar side has a ton of windows, really high ceilings, a nice big bar with plenty of seating around it, and 5 really large, well placed LCD televisions.

When I first decided to take my \"drinking business\" to this new establishment, there was one thing that didn't sit well with me...the bartender's are predominantly men.  I have no real problem with male bartenders, but I have always thought \"You know, if I'm going to sit around by myself and have a few drinks to unwind, it would be nice to have a cute girl to talk to while I have them...this place won't keep me interested for long\".  

Within a couple of visits, I noticed a few things.  I think it's important to list them out because up until this point, I hadn't considered these important factors.

The method to my madness:
Cute female bartenders have an inclination to not want to converse about things that are of interest to me.  Sure if I wanted to talk to someone about MAC makeup, UGG's, your new tattoo/piercing or god forbid, last nights episode of The Hills, they can fill that void in my life.  (Let's not even get into how a man my age knows what The Hills even is).  I don't like to listen to drama or gossip, and I could even care less about what you're doing this weekend, or how management is conspiring to destroy your life by giving you crappy shifts.  They also seem to congregate at the service area of the bar with the cute female servers and focus more on social planning than ensuring that my glass doesn't hit empty.  

Having said all of that, guys who work at this bar are there to work, i.e. make money.  Invoking the \"A dog doesn't sh!t where it eats\" policy, I know I'm not going to try to sleep with a bartender/server at my local haunt, so all of the cute in the world doesn't matter to me...my drink being replenished with delicious libations takes priority.  The guys don't seem to let the glass get dry...I appreciate that in a bartender.

Another side benefit is the fact that guy bartenders tend to be able to discuss topics of interest to me (sports, chicks, general bullshit), and a further hidden benefit is that women like guy bartenders...not cute female bartenders, so the components for a target rich environment on the customer side of the bar is increased dramatically.

Crabby Joe's also has some great drink specials...and while I'm not sure if they can advertise them or not, I certainly can discuss them here because they're pretty appealing and a good way to stretch your hard earned disposable income.

Mondays - $6.50 Schooners (1L mug of Coors Lite or Canadian)
Tuesdays - 29¢ Wings
Wednesdays - $3.50 Corona (bottle)
Thursdays - $15 Full Rack of Ribs 
Fridays - $4 Martinis (all day, 2 oz.)
Sundays - Kids eat free (kids entree for paid adult entree)
Everyday - 1/2 price appetizers after 9pm.

The bar also carries all of the premium spirits that you could hope to have (or I could hope to have).  Not being a massive alcoholic, I haven't tried everything at the bar, but here's what I can list:  Patron Anejo tequila, Woodford Reserve bourbon, Knob Creek Bourbon, Hendrick's Gin and all of the usual suspects too.  Draught on tap is exclusively Molson product (Coors Light, Heineken, MGD, Guinness, Candian and a couple of others that I don't drink).

The food is well priced, and while not gourmet, it's good chain restaurant food.  There have been a bunch of recent additions to the menu such as wraps and pastas that I haven't tried.  As you can probably figure out by now, I'm more of a bar side patron than dinner patron.  ;)

With summer right around the corner (it IS coming right?!?!) it's also important to note that they have all of the fixings for a great patio...large, all day sun exposure, outside televisions and fireplace.

This is a family friendly establishment that is a welcome addition to the area.  I feel just as comfortable bringing my daughter there for lunch or dinner as I do leaving my car in the parking lot overnight after having drinks there (I've got it down to a 12 minute morning walk).

This is a pretty busy spot, and they seem to show all of the games you could hope for, in addition to UFC events etc.  The bar hasn't seemed to attract the usual litany of barfly's which is nice...I think that can be attributed to the combination of family friendliness and male bartenders. ;-)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times, likely some of the most decent food in town can be eaten here. The wings specifically are really good, I'd specifically recommend the loaded fries."}
{"text":"Can I give 0 stars ?? Worst service I've ever had!! Are u even trained?? I've never laughed so hard after leaving a place because of being so insulted. I have told so many people not to go there because of the rude people working this place. ....sad"}
{"text":"Shitty overcooked burger. Ate 1/3 of the burger and nothing else.  Couldn't eat more. Sent it back. They didn't take it off the bill. Won't be back. Glad to see the manager is so concerned about food that gets sent back uneaten.  

Suggest you avoid."}
{"text":"Visited this location today with the kids for an end of summer lunch. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman who sat us. The restaurant was very clean. Our server was friendly and attentive. We got two burgers and their peppercorn chicken sandwich. I was finding it a bit of a wait for our lunch but was then pleasantly surprised with very juicy tasty meals. Quality does take time. Our desserts, two types of cheesecake were also very fresh and tasty. I liked generous portion of coffee. All-in-all it was a good experience and I would recommend this place for a nice family outing. I won't give them all 5 stars just yet... The food was good but didn't blow me away. Also, the new management is still a little stiff... But I have no doubt they will do well... They have the right attitude."}
{"text":"Very bland typical processed pub food in a bag. Service was slow despite not being busy. Prices seem high for this type of food quality but that's typical of franchise restaurants. Not worth returning to despite being close by."}
{"text":"It was a nice Saturday mid-afternoon. As soon as I walked into the restaurant a young lady welcomed me and asked if I wanted to sit in the bar, or dinning room area. I asked to be seated in the dinning area.

The server was very pleasant and assured I was comfortable and told me she would be back to take my order. 

She helped to explain some of the choices that they have, and I gave her my selection. The meal arrived n a prompt manner and was very tasty. 

I was the only one in the dinning room. In the bar area there was a party of two, and a party of six. The server came around shortly after I began I lunch to make sure I was satisfied. 

After finishing I waited for the server to return to ask if there was anything more, or offer me the tab. After thirty minutes of waiting I stood up and put my coat on. Still  n one took notice of me.  Next I walked over to the till and stood there for about five minutes. Then I entered the kitchen to look for someone to assist me with my bill. There were two cooks working away with their backs to me. I called out to them and asked if they knew where the front of the house staff where. Finally someone came around the corner to asked what I wanted.

It took forty five minutes to get my cheque. I don't know if it was the wait staff's first day on the job or not, but if I ran an establishment like that it would have been their last day on the job."}
{"text":"This sports bar is showing its age and the menu is nothing spectacular. Bolton doesn't have too many options when it comes to places like this (now that has changed with Brooks down the street). The place can get pretty packed and they often play loud music in the bar area.

I have come here with coworkers a couple times for their wing specials on Tuesdays. The prices are good but the food is nothing amazing. The boneless wings are a bit heavy on the beading and not as good as BWW. I wish they had more choices for the wing sauces, but if I had to settle on one I think the fire and ice is best. 

They have a decent beer selection - expect domestics and some local craft beer. And sometimes they run specials where you can pay extra and keep the mug/cup/boot thing."}
{"text":"After a night on the town we just wanted a place to sit and have a cocktail and relax with a decent meal, so whats close, well, this place.
So when we walked in, we were seated promptly and noticed the place was fairly empty for a Friday night, but also a little cold inside.  We order drinks, and food, and procede to play with this online trivia / menu thing they leave on the table which seems to be an anti social device because not everyone can participate.  So we stop dicking around with the table toys and our food finally arrives, I have the ribs, my companion has the chicken pasta something or other.  So, it was good, the ribs were tasty and cooked right, the baked potato was a little under cooked.  As for my guest, there were no complaints, other than the rather long wait for food in an almost empty place.  The service was good and the food was OK, but i suppose since the place recently opened they are still working on pulling things together.  I'll try them one more time to see if things change in the near future"}
{"text":"Lunchtime service is incredibly slow, even with few diners present, server nowhere to be seen most of the time.  Food so so, first and last time."}
{"text":"Get Buffalo quesadilla omg so good I love it here I always come here:)
I don't know why it's only 2 stars is sooo good here I love it !! 

Honestly I've only tried a couple of items on the menu but their all soooo good !!! I enjoy it here"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent. Unfortunately my boyfriend and I wanted to sit in the dinning area and everyone else. I mean everyone. Was in the bar. So she left us there while she hit it up with the guys and then finally after 26 mins ( my boyfriend had work in an hour ) I went up to one of the workers and told him and he was like \" I'm so so so sorry!!!!!\" And he was nice about it. Then the food came out fast after that but it was an annoyance. :)"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck here. Half price appetizers after 9pm, and Tuesday nights features dirt cheap wings and/or chicken fingers with lots of flavour options. They also have some cheap Bucket deals and Tall Boy discounts. If you want to hang out at a sporty bar without breaking the bank, Crabby Joe's is the place to go in Bolton.

I also recently had The Big Joe burger dressed as the Edgy Veggie burger and it was a pretty good combo. The patties are huge and it was definitely filling."}
{"text":"- it took the waiter 1 hr to bring me eater
- people buying alcoholic drinks were taken care of but we were not 
- food was 1.5 hr late
- food was cold ie. Chicken was freezing
- waitress stomped plates on table rudely once we asked when the food is coming 
- no one came to us with the bill we had to go hunt them down to pay"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  I went here craving ribs after the ribfest in Mississauga ended.  I noticed that at ribfest there was a contender named crabby joe's.  I don't know if this is the same place, maybe not, as this is a chain restaurant, but this is how I got to this place.

Well, the ribs were great!!! even better than the one I ordered at ribfest.  It was fall of the bone, the sauce was yummy.  Portion is great and price was great for $19.99.  They also had ribeye on special for $19.99 which my companion had and enjoyed.  They also have good desserts.  Tried the dessert fries and they were awesome.  The dessert bread is interesting.

There is ample parking and interior as is to be expected for chain restaurants.  This place is better than average f.or a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this location about 4-5 times have to say such an amazing shop. The staff are 5 stars the food is always good and fresh. The bar area is awesome with 5 large tv's. I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Ok, people are nice, service is fast, it's new, it hasn't lost its lustre. What can I say?"}
{"text":"OMG This place made me so freekin mad.... 

The waitress was like trying too hard to be nice ovbiously to push for a good tip ... like EVERYTHING we ordered she would say \"OMG... u read my mind i would totally be getting the same thing\" and other b.s comments like that, pretty sure if the menu said \"giant steaming turd\" she would say \"OMG thats my FAVOURITE THING!!! Steaming the turd makes it SO DELISH!\" Ughhhh....

So... service was annoying.... she was crazy slow on getting our drinks to us.... our food to us.... it wasn't even busy at all when we went so there was zero excuses. A couple of my friends had fries and burgers.... we had to tell her 3 times that we needed ketchup. And to top it all off, our food was COLD and flavorless... Then I get the bill..... REDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE... I think I had he crappy rib and chicken plate and a loaded fries (I suppose the fries were....okish), my wife had a pasta. I had 2 pints, she had 2 Long Islands.... it was just shy of 100 damn dollars... I got so mad. And I will never go back to this chain again, I can't .... nope.... never....."}
{"text":"The Burrito Joe will make you Crabby if the poor service doesn't...

I have never had a rice burrito before.  Normally I would expect a burrito to have some meat in it--wait, I think I see some shredded brown stuff that might be meat.  Can't really tell.  This burrito could qualify as vegetarian, since it had only a bit of cheese for protein.  I left most of the sticky, overcooked rice behind and still felt bloated on carbs.

The lone waitress only had 3 or 4 tables, but only one was dominating her time with random conversation.  Outside of that, it was really hard for the rest of us to attract her attention.  My iced tea arrive just before the meal, and the side of guacamole arrived when I was half finished the meal.

This is a restaurant whose looks reminds me of Jack Astor's, but without the good food.  Surprisingly, there is probably double the meat in a single Taco Bell burrito at half the price--but the Taco Bell burrito tastes better..."}
{"text":"The food is average and overpriced.  Wing night is a solid value.  My kids love the place."}
{"text":"Nothing is more appetizing that the smell of a Waste Dump Truck at 12pm, stopped right beside the wobbly patio table in which you are sitting, while you are deciding upon what to order.  

And nothing creates a better ambiance than the sounds of additional food and beer delivery transport trucks throughout the lunch hour- loud engines and reverse warning beeps right beside the patio... so loud that it drowns out the music coming from the patio speakers.

It's only happened a few times... today it was a Monday.  But really?  Can't you schedule those trucks before you open!!!

Great prices on beers- $2.99 domestic bottles and $7.00 for 32 oz schooners...  a good deal if you prefer to drink the Molson Canadian.

There are daily deals on food.  The sizzlin' fajita's are great and they have gourmet-esque burgers for $7 till 5pm.

I have been to this Crabby's probably 10 times over the last 3 years during work-hour lunches.  Service is usually slow and somewhat inattentive but the food is usually decent... for a pub."}
{"text":"Came here during the lunch hour mid week , so t was pretty dead which was nice . 
I walked in and went to the bar and I must say I was pleasantly surprised at how nice it was inside .
Very new location very modern and nice .
Huge tv for watching there games ! 
Good beer selection and decent food .
Bartender was nice and pleasant .
Great place to come watch the game with friends and have a few drinks for sure !"}
{"text":"Nice mid upscale place
Wings are ok but breaded ain't, that being said best breaded wings I had 
Also the chicken fingers are much too breaded 
But go on Tuesday for 60c wings and 99c fingers and you can't complain
Not bad service but not the best ie only a spoon for fajitas, wake up, also Wednesday is half off fajitas, but they don't advertise it anywhere, again wake up, 
Broads are friendly enough but it's obvious they're all about tips
Dear stupid girls they didn't open up the business solely for your benefit, idiot."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night for dinner for a birthday when it was not busy. Food took a while to come out & the waitress forgot our order & had to come back to confirm. Again, it wasn't busy or crowded so not sure how our order was forgotten.  
Someone who appeared to be a manager came up to our table asking if we were there for a special event which we were & ensured something special would be done for the birthday boy which never happened & I had to remind the waitress after she brought our bills and we expected a small dessert before we paid up cus that's what was promised but it was never communicated to the waitress. 
I'm giving this place 3 stars cus the food is pretty good but service was not what I expected especially for a kids birthday gesture."}
{"text":"This place is not that great. My boyfriend and I both got pasta and the noodles were undercooked. The flavour was very bland. I didn't want to finish my food. However, they have half priced appetizers after 9, but you have to buy a drink. Probably won't be back here"}
{"text":"Good ribs, good selection of beer on tap, and my wife likes their salads."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite on a Wednesday. Good deal as import beers are 3.50$ and chicken wraps 11.99$. Chicken was a touch light in portion and the vegetables over grilled. We also ordered nachos which were the highlight of our visit. Fresh, crispy and tasty. Heaped full of cheese and fresh vegetables. Had coffee afterward which was hot, fresh and robust in taste. We sat in bar area which was clean and comfortable. Our initial server was pleasant and accommodating. Her replacement did seem interested in being there and hospitable."}
{"text":"Both times we've been it's just been a joke lol. Worst service. You won't even get acknowledged til about 20 minutes after you sit down and the food is shit too. Asked a waitress who our server was after sitting there for 15 minutes and she pointed at some dude and said \"him\". Left five minutes later. Luckily Wild Wing is in town."}
{"text":"Its a nice place to go grab some food, drink a beer while watching sports. The food is good, can't complain. The only negative thing is they take too long to bring you the food. If you are starving maybe go somewhere else. Beside that everything is good"}
{"text":"Very fast service during supper rush. Friendly servers. Great Ribs. Fantastic Coleslaw. Left full and happy with this place."}
{"text":"Preface:  I'm not big into going to chain restaurants.  I'm you place me inside a Kelsey's, Jack Astor's, Milestone's, Crabby Joe's, I would not know the difference.  They're all kinda the same to me.

Having said that, I don't think Crabby Joe's was bad at all.

After seeing that they were offering a Buy 1 Get 1 Free Burger on their Grand Opening, I made last minute plans and came in with a friend.  It's in a fairly new complex, sharing a parking lot with some heavy hitters like Walmart Superstore, Costco (w/ gas station!), LCBO, Starbucks, a coupla banks, and there's a East Side Mario's a couple of units down.  This area tends to get quite busy already, especially during peak hours.

The Crabby Joe's itself is brand spanking new, from the floor up.

Greeter was efficient, server was nice, did her job, but didn't really up-sell drinks/daily specials which is fine, but sorta unusual for a chain restaurant.  Restaurant was surprisingly quiet for dinner service, after having advertised on Facebook!

We ordered the Classic + Edgy Veggie, with sides of fries, salad.  Burgers (& fries too) were smaller than I expected, but decent size for me.  (Big eaters may find it on the small side.)  Buns were fresh, as were the toppings.  

My only criticism was that although the meat patty was juicy, but could've been hotter, temperature-wise.  The Veggie Patty was not quite room temperature which is immediately noticeable when you are hungry!  Dang thing was barely warm.  Other than that, good flavour on both meat & veg version.

There was signange on the back of the building which states that they have daily drink specials.  And drinks, in general, didn't seem all that expensive which is definitely a motivating factor to come back!

I wouldn't be opposed to going back."}
{"text":"Terrible service!! Went in sat down on what seemed like a pretty slow Thursday evening. There were only  a handful of tables with customers. Looked at the menu for about 10 min with out someone taking an order. Finally the waitress took the order and then we waited another 10min when we finally just walked out.  20 min without even a drink on an evening that is slow is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Needs improvement! 
I think this location could do really well but since they are new there are a few kinks they need to work out. My friend and I ordered spinach dip and wings (our Tuesday night usual at the Brantford location), and were slightly disappointed. When the spinach dip came out the pita was hard as a rock, which is no big deal. We asked our waitress if we could just get some new pita. Since she did not speak English very well I think she misunderstood because the manager had come to talk to us asking what was wrong with the spinach dip. We told her nothing was wrong, that the pita was just as hard as a crouton. She apologized and then said it would be taken off our bill! Awesome! We then got our wings and the cook of the wings was delicious but there was a lack of seasoning. My friend gets honey garlic and I always get dill pickle. I think there is just an inconsistency between owners because we are used to tons of sauce and tons of dill pickle seasoning on our wings in Brantford. Not a big deal but they could definitely add more. When we got our bill we were charged for 2 spin dips but one was taken off. My friend and I were unaware that we were going to be given a second spinach dip, we only wanted new pita. We spoke to the manager again and she ended up giving us half off the spinach dip which was nice. 
There was just a lot of confusion between the server due to the language barrier and the owners shouldn't skimp on flavour because of cost. 
Overall it was good."}
{"text":"I decided to try this restaurant on a whim for lunch and was pleasantly surprised not only by the family and well-furnished environment with large screen TVs and fireplace; Both indoors AND outdoors. The patio environment offered a very spacious area for dining with benched seating. This restaurant is also an excellent venue for parties! whew, now the menu; I decided to go a la Mexicano and savoured not only Bruschetta (which I might add was the absolute best flatbread -feta cheese-onion-tomato bruschetta I've ever tried) but the chicken quesadilla, which was simultaneously crispy and gooey and interestingly savourful with the hint of 
Cajun spice. Service was very prompt and courteous."}
{"text":"Came here on a sunday evening to eat with my family.  They have a deal where your kids eat for free on Sunday. 1 kid free per adult meal.  Cannot be bundle with any other offers that they also have running. For example bundling it up with a $20 3 course meal deal is NO DICE. Sucks ah well.  The kids meal go for $7 and comes with a drink, main meal with side and a Kinder Surprise.  All this for free not too bad at all. Kids enjoyed their meal it was good portion for them.  I got a NY steak sirlion medium rare with steamed veggies and baked potatoe.  

My meal was a little well done and the baked potatoe didnt have melted butter on top and it had a bunch of salt loaded on it.  The meal ot self was okay a lil bit loaded on the salt end but still i will finish my meal.  

Service wise was okay a bit slow on the service side but overall ill give this place a 3.5 star.  I will definitely come back agaon and try their other meals on the menu.  Lookong forward to checking this place out again. 
Word UP!!!! Check check check it out"}
{"text":"We walked in and asked if we could sit on the patio, we were told there would be a 5 minute wait, so, we sat at the bar. As you can see the patio from where we were sitting and the patio was near empty we asked again if we could sit out there, the waitress said yes but food takes 5 minutes longer if you sit out on the patio. Seriously? It's just outside not down the road. 

As promised the service was slow, only somewhat friendly. It was like we're being friendly because we have to, but we really don't want to. Our drinks were running empty for a while before they'd ask us if we wanted more  The place was pretty empty inside and out, there was really no excuse for the poor service. 

The food was mediocre and rather cool, but it took a while and we really didn't want to do that wait again for hot food. it wasn't like we ordered anything intricate, we started with the crabby platter, and then got wings. 

The oddest part of it all was before we even ordered, I pulled out my iPhone and showed her my Yelp app and showed her the check in coupon, to which she replied it has to be printed out, but I just got it when I checked in, I'm not even sure I can print it out. The Yelp coupon was for 50% off on appetizer, she offered us in lieu a buy one get one upto 7.50 on a main course, which we had no intentions of getting. 

Overall the impression of this trip was weak, and had it been my only trip here, I'd probably not be headed back, but I have been here in the past and had slightly better experiences, that was a while ago though. I'm willing to try again, and hope for a much improved experience."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago with my boyfriend. We walked seated ourself in the bar area. The bartender approach us for a drink.  We ordered and that came quickly. Then we ordered dinner . Our dinner took 30 mins and when it arrived mine was cold. I waited for the waitress to come back normally it's about 2 mins after your food arrives, to check how everything is.  I waited for 30 mins . Nobody came over  . I went to the dining room  to look for someone working their and nothing.  Finally I found someone and asked to speak to a manager , only to find out there wasn't one working that night. The server came over after I was speaking to another girl and  said. \" I hearing somethings wrong.  I explained my food was cold and I was waiting for her to come over to get a new plate. She offered new fries. At this point my boyfriend was already done eating which no explained to her. She rolled her eyes and walked away.

The service here was discusting   I would never return to this resturaunt ."}

{"text":"We when for the first time on sunday around 2pm it wasnt very busy, I order the smokey bacon ceasar, I had the mushroom mozza burger and loaded fries, my husband had the nachos and beer. both were very good our waitress was  very polite and took very good care of us she had a great personality. wish I could remember her name. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"No thanks, service took a long time for everything - to be seated, drinks, food, bill

Food tasted microwaved, and pricey for what you get

Nachos were probably the best of what we ordered

Forget food allergies, they didn't know what was in anything as it's all pre-made

Steak was miniscule, and dry

There's other places to eat, so not worth wasting time or money here. Sorry."}
{"text":"Great lunch today, quick service.  Lots of relatively healthy choices and well priced, was pleasantly surprised.  We started with the Avocado Toast followed by the Mayan Shrimp bowl and the Nashville Chicken Tacos, would definitely order them again! Good portion and tasty!"}
{"text":"Decor: normal chain restaurant decor. Seats on the booths were old and tearing. Paper on the table was fun. 

Greeting: quick and efficient seating. Pleasant hostess.

Server: seemed to have better things to do. Inattentive and forgetful. Got my husband's order wrong and then it took another 20 minutes to bring out the correct order, and when it did come out, it was cold and I was done my meal. Plates left on table when food was done, didn't refill water glasses until we found another server to get us some. She was a bit defensive and rude the entire time and we were there for two hours. 

Professionalism: server was new, and seemed unhappy and like we were an inconvenience. My husband was asked once if he wanted a water refill, and I wasn't asked once. We spent most of our time waiting. 

Complaint handling: we asked for the bill and when the server dropped it off, she left without asking if we needed the machine and left us waiting (again) for her to come back. We had to flag down another employee to grab us the machine so we could leave and told her that it was disappointing service throughout the meal and it was unfortunate that we were charged full price. She told our server and she came back to our table with the machine asking something along the lines of \"what's the problem?\" and confronted us about our complaint. It was really uncomfortable. 

We will never go back."}
{"text":"I went into crabby joes. With a friend i ordered a pasta and a flatbread i got my pasta it was under cooked the noodles the shrimp some of the chicken was so hard it was really gross it taste like it was made in the microwave and  the server went into the kitchen and told the cooks about the pasta and they were all laughing about it .ive got the same pasta everytime and no problems this time was the worst i was very very upset and mad my friend had to pay the  bill cause i was very upset and mad how i was treated. and walked out crying  .They should not treat there customers that way at all .i wont ever get food there again ever so discussed with that server and the kitchen ."}
{"text":"Apps are generally good but I'd avoid the French onion soup unless you LOVE salt....  Service is a mixed bag depending on who you get.  Our entrees on our most recent visit were disappointing but I've been here and enjoyed the food before... Restaurant is usually pretty understaffed I assume to maximize profits but having tables sit dirty for an hour is very unbecoming.... I want to like it here there's just too much inconsistency...."}
{"text":"I have come to Crabby Joe's a couple times since their launch.  
Their wings are really good, and the Tuesday 39 cent wings are definitely a great deal.  

But I most often come on Sundays, for the kids eat free.   Service is friendly, atmosphere and environment are clean.  And it's always nice when the kids can colour on the table and menu.  

I've never stated this about any restaurant I have reviewed, and I understand this is likely a chain thing... but the menu is too big.  It's like 6 or 8 pages.  Food is okay.  Doesn't knock my socks off.  It's a good place to bring the family on Sundays... cheaper prices and better quality than the close by East Side Mario's.  
I think it goes right underneath Boston Pizza... but with the kids eat free bonus.  

Service is good... I usually go for one of their burgers, as they have a bunch of specialty ones.  On occasion, burger has been a little dry, but that's it.  

No complaints... what you see is what you get.  :)"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Brought wrong meal to my girlfriend by the time her meal arrived i had finished mine. Service was slow and understaffe.salad tatsed like vomit."}
