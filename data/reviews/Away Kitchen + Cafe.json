{"text":"This place opened up a week ago and decided to drop by. I love how aesthetic this place look. With beautiful organic wood tables and plants all around the store. The place is really bright so it's a good place to study. They also provide free wifi!  I believe that it's just their soft opening and they will have their grand opening soon. Can't wait to see what else they might bring in. They also accept debit so that's always a plus. I will definitely return soon to explore other parts of their menu"}
{"text":"I love this place. Wonderful decor and sunlight coming from a south facing storefront. A nice selection of vegan pastries and meals - a list that changes regularly. Great coffee and tea. Topped off by warm and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Great spot. Friendly staff and excellent atmosphere. The coffee is top notch, as well as the food. Great date spot, or if you need to get some work done. Also great for when you're on the run."}
