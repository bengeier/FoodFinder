{"text":"Went to the Vaughan city grill this weekend and they were insanely busy but they made sure that we were all accommodating. The food was fresh and delicious definitely made to order. Service was great! Waitresses and even one of the owners made sure we were all ok. I will be going back and definitely will be bringing more guests and I recommend this place to everyone who wants good service and fresh food."}
{"text":"Dropped into Vaughan City Grill for a late breakfast. Good food, fast service. Thank you Tianna for your great service we will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast with our two boys under four who enjoyed colouring while waiting for their waffles. 

Nice quiet spot with good value for good food."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with the family. Stephanie, our server, was pleasant and helpful. The food was very good, and the decor was immaculate. They seem to be doing things right here."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast/brunch place of hwy7. Had the cheese and ham omelette. Great coffee also."}
{"text":"Such rudeness! We didn't even stay. They made us stand at the door for 10 minutes, didn't even acknowledge our presence, then gave us rude responses when we tried to find a place to sit. After 20 minutes we just left. Never going there again!!"}
{"text":"Just found the Vaughan City Grille this morning while searching for a new breakfast spot on Google. Had the salmon eggs Benedict and my wife had the chicken eggs benny.

Eggs cooked to perfection, delicious hollandaise, amazing home fries and fresh coffee. Everything I could want in a breakfast, done well.

I only wish I'd found this place months ago."}
{"text":"I was supposed to be at the breakfast place across the street but ended up here accidentally since I had just moved to the area. Not very pleased with the service. I had Spanish omelette which was okay but the coffee was cold (may be because it was on the house that day) and when I mentioned it is cold the server got defensive and said it was just made. That was awkward! Anyhow, not the best experiences I've had. I'm sure there are better places nearby! Good luck to them since they just opened!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Had the Vaughan City Grill Breakfast. Great portions and quality. Friendly staff - I had Camilla, super nice. They even gave me a free cookie with my coffee. Good times. Will be back for sure. Update had the nutella waffles and chicken amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible breakfast and not great service. Food came out cold and the hollindaise sauce was made from powder and bland. Their home fries were dry and burnt with no seasoning not even oil or bacon fat they seemed to be baked dry plain potatoes. We had a 3 year old with us and other children were given coloring but for some reason we werent. The ketchup on our table was empty and when we asked for some they were all out and we got ketchup packages. I would never go back their are so many other breakfast places close to this one."}
{"text":"I came here for a Boxing Day brunch with some friends and had the yogurt parfait and shared the special pancakes (I believe they were blueberry lemon ricotta that day), and they were great! I don't usually love pancakes but these ones were really delicious. Super light and fluffy, and perfect to share. 3 of my other friends got sandwiches and they all enjoyed them as well. 
The staff are super friendly and really nice, I would definitely come back for a nice simple breakfast one day :)"}
{"text":"Yesterday went out to a new All day breakfast and lunch place.It was very busy.I can see why it was I was very impressed with the fresh food and very delicious.It was a very comfortable welcoming enviroment the servers were great. I can see the pride the owners take in their restaurant.I will definitely go back and will recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I don't see how this place has gotten such high reviews. My eggs benny came out cold. The eggs themselves weren't even poached and runny. The pancakes were okay nothing too special. Overall won't be returning.

Edit: they were nice enough to take the eggs benny off the receipt. 3 stars for service."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our breakfast this morning. Excellent food, great price and friendly staff. Stephanie was a great server and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"We had a great meal at the Vaughan City Grill. Great coffee, great service, awesome food and fair prices. I was fortunate to have Lemon Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes (posted a pic of them), and my wife had the Big Breakfast (Eggs, Ham, Sausage, Bacon and Home Fries). The ham is really tender and surprisingly good.

If you're in the area, check them out. We'll be coming back for some of their lunch fare. A hamburger topped with Mortadella? You bet!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, fabulous food, and outstanding service. Sounds like the recipe for success. 

I found this place on Yelp, and the outstanding reviews are true. The food was really good, and the service was so friendly, that even when one of my daughters got a bit upset our waitress came over and wanted to help, but she was luckily quick to calm down. My daughters enjoyed it so much they didn't give me any problems to finish their meals. 

They hang the colouring of the children on the wall, so they can see them whenever they return."}
{"text":"Just finished a delicious breakfast of French Toast with crispy bacon....deelish! Very clean breakfast spot with very reasonable prices and friendly service. Highly recommended.  Would consider this family-owned place over a chain."}
{"text":"Came here Christmas Eve day and they had excellent service and food options. Came here with a group of 6. Friendly family run business. Great flavourful food. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict, with hollandaise sauce on the side. The portions were++ generous and very filling. They even gave an extra side of house style potatoes (because there wasn't enough room on the plate!). 

I recommend this place :) parking is readily available in their lot, for free. Family friendly. Can accommodate groups. And thankful for yelp review check-ins!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new place and they are very willing to accommodate patrons requests.  On our first visit a fellow diner requested a menu item and before we finished our meal the staff informed us that they would be trying it out.  And they did!  I've only had breakfast here and it is definitely good for that!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning before the \"church rush\". The restaurant is really nice inside. Neutrally decorated but it looks clean and tidy. The service was great. Our food came really fast and everything was fresh and tasty. And the prices are really reasonable. For my boyfriend and I to get two huge breakfasts and drinks it came to just over 20$.The menu is simple and easy to order from. For first timers we were very impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"So clean. Great scents.  Friendly atmosphere. An ample amount of choice. EAT. ENJOY. RELAX"}
