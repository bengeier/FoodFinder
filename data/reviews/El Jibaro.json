{"text":"humongous portions! we tried the jalea personal and we would have had enough for 4 people (we were 2). Some people say it's pricey but we had an awesome meal (and plenty leftovers) for 35$ including 2 chicken soups, one appetizer (forget the name, cold baked potato with slightly spicy cheese sauce with olives and eggs, really amazing!) and a jalea personal (which feeds 4 easily). I guess service could have been a tiny bit faster, but we weren't in a rush."}

{"text":"Usually its been a great experience but lastly this time,it hasnt been well.Im creating this post in hopes the owners can re look at how they cook peruvian dishes.Lomo saltado is the foundation of any peruvian cuisine.Yet i dont understand how you can mess this dish up! The home fries were replaced by mcane fries.There used to be sauce leaking,yet this time it was a dry stir fry with no sign of tomato anywhere!!! How can you mess up this honestly? The rice was overcooked."}
{"text":"Traditional Spanish Food.
Amazing!!!! The sharing sea plate is a must!
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Restaurant prefere d'une amie, ca fait maintenant 3 fois que je l'essaye et honnetement je suis perplexe. 

Le service est moyen, ca peut etre tres long des fois, ils ne servent pas en ordre les gens arrives, ils oublient des commandes. Par contre, ils sont tres gentils et chaleureux. 

Niveaux nourriture, les fruits de mer sont 
tres bons, les sauces, omosaltado etc. La seule chose et qui pour moi fait perdre des points: ils n'utilisent pas du yuca frais! Leur yuca frit goute le vieux, dure, a la limite un gout de pourris? C'est bizzare car le reste est tres bon. Mais ca fait 3 fois maintenant...

Y a toujours du monde qui mange la, honnetement je n'y retournerai pas a moins d'etre oblige!"}
{"text":"After passing by this restaurant many times over the last several years, I finally popped in to grab some take-out one week-day evening for my family.

It was a bit pricey for a neighborhood Peruvian restaurant, but not outrageous, and the portion sizes are huge. I ordered the chicken breast and salad and it was satisfactory. My husband loved his ceviche, which he had planned to save half for his lunch the next day, but as he kept saying, ''oh my goodness, this is so good, I can't stop eating it'' and so, in the end, there was nothing left to save.

There are just two appetizers on the menu and I got both of them. One with potatoes and cheese and the other is the Peruvian tamale. I was not a fan of the potatoes and cheese, but the tamale was really tasty.

Since it is just a stone's throw from our residence, I am quite sure we will be back again, soon."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to have a dinner with friends and share delicious Peruvian food. Ceviche is nice and I'm a big fan of their seafood combos. It's a \"bring your own wine\" restaurant with a nice atmosphere and an authentic touch. It's easy on your wallet and you'll never walk away hungry type of place. Definitely will be back there again."}
