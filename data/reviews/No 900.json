{"text":"C'était la première fois que j'y allais. J'y compte bien revenir. Le personnel est accueillant et chaleureux. La nourriture était bonne. l'entrée de burrata était excellente et la pizza que j'ai prise était bien ,mais j'ai mieux aimée celle de mon amoureux aux prosciutto. En sommes , bonne bouffe , bonne ambiance et bon personnel ."}
{"text":"Was out with some friends and decided to try out this new place...bad decision. Place was busy, we figured \"must be good\". Waiter did the best he could, especially since it was his 2nd day :)  We ordered 6 pizzas, 5 came...even after saying we were missing one it fell on deaf ears. Either way it never came. What we did get were nothing to write home about...nothing special. Won't be back and don't recommend."}
{"text":"This is a new branch that just opened at Centrepolis. I had past in front of it the other day and made a mental note to try it.  Today after last minute Christmas shopping, I came by to have some pizza, the place is small, high ceiling, black, White & yellow is the theme of the place. Its cute, but on a winter day when there is not many customers, it was cold inside.  I ordered minestrone soup for starter so I could warm up a bit, but the soup was luke warm, and usually minestrone is suppose to have tomato soup base, but this was lacking any tomatoes. Taste was okay, nothing spectacular.  I ordered margarita pizza, which is a very basic pizza. I wasn't really impressed, I usually love pizza dough and can't wait to have it. This was the first time in my whole life and I cut the pizza crust (the edges) out and put it on the side. I did not like the taste of the dough at all, I actually can't pin point the problem, I just know I did not like it and my taste buds rejected it.  The sauce was okay, cheese was tasty, seasoning was good. The waitress was really nice, friendly, she explained that due to the e.coli outbreak anything with romaine lettuce in the menu would be substituted with arugula, which made me very happy as this shows they care and take these issues seriously.  All in all taste was for me it was very average. But they have many branches and I am assuming that people enjoy it if they keep expanding. Maybe they were having a bad day or maybe it was just not my type.  I will leave it up to you to decide."}
{"text":"I often passed by this place and wanted to try it one day. The menu was in Italian so I had to google most of the ingredients to know what they are (I get it, it's fancy so that wasn't a real problem).  The pizza I ordred tasted very average. Not a lot of ingredients so no real taste. The only thing good about it was the bread.  I'm not impressed. Even when they have so much competition (there are other pizzas nearby) the pizza wasn't great.  First and last time.  The waitress was nice and friendly."}
