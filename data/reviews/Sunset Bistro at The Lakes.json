{"text":"Do not ever eat the food there. We live in WBV and have tried the restaurant a couple times to give it a chance. It's awful no matter what you order off the menu. It's a nice place to have a drink and a nice view but that's it."}
{"text":"Whether you're playing golf at The Lakes, visiting friends in Westbrook Village, or just happen to be hungry and/or thirsty in the neighborhood, Sunset Bistro is a great stop. 

Good menu selection of consistent tasty food, full bar, beer on tap, and great service makes for a fantastic visit.   

On hot summer days, there's seating inside the bar and adjacent which is cool and comfortable.   If it's nice out, I recommend the outdoor patio, looking over the 9th fairway and green.   The decor is a little dated, but in this 55+ community it seems to be okay (a little update would be nice).  

Sunset Bistro is my \"go to\" when I'm back in AZ.   Try it, and maybe it will become your \"go to\" as well.i"}

{"text":"The Sunset Bistro at the Lakes is a wonderful place. I've been here on several occasions with my in-laws and it's a great experience every time. Every time I go there we get wonderful service and amazing food. It's a located on a beautiful golf course which makes for great scenery."}
{"text":"Cool, had live music, food was mediocre. I liked our waiter but he made a lot of mistakes the night we were there, could be do to the fact they were understaffed."}
{"text":"Our lunch was good, service was good, the view across the lake and the golf couse....brilliant!"}
