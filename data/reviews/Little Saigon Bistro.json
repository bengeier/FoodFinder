{"text":"Thanks to the new owners for turning a fantastic lunch spot into a **** hole. I stopped yesterday for their special satay beef on noodle. the beef was extremely fatty, noodle were dry and greasy, and the peanuts were almost not even there. You lost a customer who has been there 2 to 3 times a week since the place opened.  Thanks a lot"}
{"text":"I come here for lunch often. I pike the food, prices and especially how quickly they prepare it."}
{"text":"Came here since the other place down the street had lineups.  Restaurant was quiet with only one other table at 1pm on Saturday.  Food was surprisingly good.  Pho was piping hot.  Bun had lots of beef and less vermicelli than expected.  Nice service.  Good choice in area.  Vast menu including sushi rolls and poke bowl.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"On my visit to Calgary, this restaurant stays in my memory.  The pho was so good.  The beef was so tender you can taste it in every bite and the broth was so delicious.  The owner husband and wife is also very friendly and welcoming.  They sat down with us and greeted us like family. The Vietnamese springroll was also very tasty and homemade.  I finished every single thing on my bowl ! If I ever go back to Calgary this restaurant will be my first step for pho!  I reccommend  going here for authentic Vietnamese  cuisine."}
{"text":"I am addicted to their Sate Beef soup ...lots of creamy coconut milk with a great touch of heat and herbs to make it extra tasty. Hate to admit it but I probably eat here 3-4 times a week. Great service and the rest of the food looks good too. Tiny dining area but good enough if you get here before noon."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick lunch.  You can pick up or dine-in.  Beware that their dining room is quite small so you may be out of luck for larger groups.  They are quick, fast and relatively inexpensive.  Subs are around $5.50.  Where can you find a lunch for $5.50 these days?"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past four years. It was a cold snowy day and I came in for a large rare beef soup. The soup was huge. Broth was great. Service excellent. I came after the lunch hour rush. She gave me a taste of the satay broth. It was excellent.  This is a clean, small restaurant that serves good Vietnamese food."}
