{"text":"Sam Woo is the perfect destination for Chinese styled BBQ Meats! There is really no other place to go if you're looking for succulent BBQ'ed chicken, duck or pig meat. Definitely one of the few restaurants that give you large chucks of meat and not just the fat and skin. Regardless, Sam Woo has wonderfully barbequed the meats to perfection while still maintaining the delicious fat, flavour and crunchy skin where others contrast to a dry, chewy and just fattied meat. The BBQ duck and roasted pork are my favourite dishes as the meats inside are soft and tender while the skin outside maintains it's crispiness.  As for the service at Sam Woo, I think it's adequate but because the waiters/waitresses have some difficulty understanding English it might be a bit hard to order. I recommend you buying the BBQ items by pointing towards the meat you want behind the glass counter and getting it to go."}
{"text":"Best BBQ pork and duck in the city ... the BBQ wings are great too.  Basically everything is amazing and if you want to spend your afternoon in a blissful meat coma this is where you need to go.  Very reasonable lunch specials (meat + rice).  Note: If you've got enough people ... we've ordered in the BBQ goose to the office before as well and it was great.  Nice change.  You need to order this ahead of time.  As a previous poster noted ... you will be the proud owner of a goose beak if you order this feast.  If you think you've tasted great BBQ pork, at a restaurant, TNT, etc - you haven't.  Go get some of the food these masters at work produce.  PS:  If the man with the giant cleaver chopping meat on a tree stump asks \"You want sauce?\" your answer is yes.  You want sauce."}
{"text":"Hong Kong oriented restaurant. They were there since 1990s, great restaurant and ordered usual Peking duck, roasted pork, fish, and their famous pork stomach. Food is great but service is a bit slow or either not enough servers. I still like the place."}
{"text":"BBQ Pork on rice is the best I've ever had. It's my go to when I'm need of a no brainer meal."}
{"text":"Rude waitresses and owner. Sneaky butcher and cashier. If you refuse their hard selling, they will sneak the way more pieces into your order so they can charge you way more! They also switch out meats even you have paid for the premium and give you the fat and crappy ones. To all, don't forget to check your order and receipt before you leave the take out session. Otherwise you will get 'surprises'. What a shame a well know restaurant to treat its loyal customers in this way!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to location from way back. Tonight I came here for a late night dinner of BBQ Pork and rice. I had a huge craving for it!   Since I had somewhere to be I did take out. Fast service with a smile! The BBQ pork is pretty good. It was nice and lean with a bit of fat. However, it was a tad salty for my taste. Rice was well cooked. Sauce was the usual BBQ pork sauce you'd find anywhere.   Overall, good and cheap food if you want something fast!"}
{"text":"I have always liked Sam Woo except for this time. When I order Ho Fun Soup from a Chinese restaurant I expect Sha Ho Fun not Pho though barbecue pork is still as good. If I were to have Pho I'll go to a Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"We haven't gone back to this restaurant for a long time.  We are having our dinner late that night and so think of Sam Woo for their late dinner menu.  We are a bit earlier and the late dinner menu does not start.  But we notice that the late dinner menu used to be below $20 mark now is $25 to $30.  With this price range, it is no more economical and you can have it anywhere.  We order from the normal dinner menu.  They come quick.  Quality is average.  Service is ok.  It used to be better.  Though I still like the BBQ take out."}
{"text":"I order takeouts from time to time especially roasted pork and duck, but lately found their service to be abysmal. The pieces were mostly just fat and when I asked for pieces with less fat, I was given attitude like they're too good for me. I ended just getting my roasted pork and duck at the Silverstar foodcourt."}
{"text":"Scarborough classic! Lots of nice Chinese BBQ meats, epecially BBQ duck. Happy with the pricing."}
{"text":"Sam Woo BBQ is a traditional Chinese restaurant that has been around for over 25 years. It was once tooted as one of the better Chinese BBQ restaurants with multiple locations across the GTA. These days, there are only two locations left - one in Mississauga and the other in Scarborough. I went to the one in Scarborough on a Saturday evening and was seated fairly quickly. I wasn't quite sure what to expect in terms of the food quality since I haven't been to a Sam Woo in over two decades. I figured how bad can it be if the restaurant is still surviving. Well...let's just say that it is literally just \"surviving\" . The food was unimpressive to say the least. I ordered the shrimp and chicken stir fry with vegetables (the shrimp tasted like what I think an ocean would taste like - \"oceany\"), diced beef saut√©ed with onions (way too salty), salted free range chicken (with a side of dry and skinny), snow pea tips with garlic (meh), and Yeung Chow Fried Rice (this was the most disappointing of all the dishes. Burnt, bland, and boring. This is such a classic dish, I don't even know how they messed this one up).  Overall, the service was okay, the restaurant needed a major overhaul, portions were small, food didn't taste great, price point was way above what the food quality was worth, and the menus looked like they were chewed up by a very hungry animal. It's quite sad to see the decline of a restaurant that once was so popular. With so many new Chinese restaurants these days, especially uptown, the competition is fierce. There's no room for tattered menus and overly priced bland food. Unless you feel like going back to 1996 for a nostalgic moment (although the taste might make you think twice), I suggest you look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant before but this time is the worst customer experience one can have, I order fried rice with the ying yan source(sweet on one side and the other is white source) and bbq pork side dish.  At first the fried rice look nice, but when I bite into the shrimp it tasted funky. Believe me, I usually cook at home, and I can tell was is fresh and what is not, I paid almost 15 with tax, for one dish, please do not give me ingredient that is not fresh come on, then comes the bbq pork.  The most disappointing part of the dish, is that this restaurant pull all the old mean at the bottom to make it look good on the top, and after you eat into it, you later find out that all the old meat is in the bottom, and they tried to hide it too, by adding soya sauce to it so you can't tell that it has been a long time, and they are still serving old meat, come on. And to top it all off the bill was not cheap, came to around 60 with tax for 2 dish, with old meat and funky shrimp.....Save your money and find yourself a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Third time's a charm. First Chinese BBQ restaurant we tried tonight was take-out only. Second one had closed early (see my other yelp reviews). This restaurant did not disappoint. The BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken were succulent and top-notch. The noodle and hot pot dishes we also ordered were very good and ample. Open until midnight during the week. Best food I had on this trip to Toronto. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I often come here to eat with family and relatives when I was young. It's fast - wait time is never too long, and the bbq meat is pretty good. The prices are very good for the amount they give you. And I would say that the quality of their food has remained the same over the years. Of course maybe price hasn't, but still decent compared to some other restaurants."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Sam woo since forever. They serve delicious authentic Chinese food. Every dish is unique on it's own. You get a free soup appetizer which is house made and a free dessert broth with papaya almonds and some type of fungus.   When you first walk in, there is a large display of barbeque. Roast succulent duck, crispy roast pig, barbecued pork and juicy chicken. Make sure to order a plate of 3 meats. My favorites there are the sweet and sour pork and the crispy fried fish fillets. The atmosphere is loud friendly and bustling. The prices are reasonable, what better place to eat?!"}
{"text":"I usually read comments....but this time...I need to share my feeling... Sam Woo BBQ ....very poor service one of the worst restaurant I have visited in my life When I was young, over 20 years ago, I usually went there At that time, there were not so many BBQ restaurants in Toronto, and Sam Woo....their food was good 20 years later, I seldom come here... as nowadays, so many choices around in GTA Today, I come again for my old memories However, memories become nightmares  Food Quality -- Bad 20 years ago....they have good reputations... If you ask someone for BBQ....his / her first response was Sam Woo But nowadays, too many competitors...they do not have any improvement.. and cannot maintain the good quality... any one of the BBQ restaurants....even BBQ stalls in Chinese supermarkets or in food courts...the food is better than Sam Woo's (they are still living in their old good days)  Service -- Bad Ask tea? No tea....ask rice...no rice...Dessert...I don't wait for it attitude of the waiter.... like your boss If you are workaholic .... please come here...enjoy your meal with your bosses   Sam Woo BBQ -- bye bye....I never come again"}
{"text":"This is the ONLY Chinese restaurant my family and I go to because of how amazing it is. We have been coming for 20 years and the place has not changed. Everything is amazing, from the duck to the fried rice (BEST EVER!!!). The food is really what makes this place. The service is alright. Unfortunately, the place is loud, although the customers don't seem to care. Lots of kids, yelling, running around sometimes, but what can you do. The portions are a great size, and we always take the leftovers to go. The prices are great as well."}
{"text":"This place is so close to home and quick and delicious. They have comfort food and it appears it is quite busy even on weekdays. What makes this place so great is that if you eat dinner there, they provide you with free soup and free dessert soup after. Upon noticing how many people ordered fish, we decide to order it too. Apparently the fish is cheap only $12 for a full fish. Their snow pea veggie is real good too! Their bbq duck isn't bad but had better. Overall great food for the price."}
{"text":"I have nothing but praise for this place!!! This use to be a place I hate due to the bad service that I get!! But everything was well made! Even my one year old picky eater likes this place! We had steam fish that was made to perfection! A tofu dish with Chinese mushrooms which was excellent in flavor and tenderness in the mushroom makes me scream for more!!! The cashew veggie was soo good!! I didn't know I love cashews that much!! And the deep fried oysters OMG!!! U have to try it!"}
{"text":"The best char siu I've had. Other BBQ items are very tasty as well. Service is better compared to the standard service from other Chinese restaurants. Our waiter was very polite to us. It's an old school restaurant. I really hope they will survive."}
{"text":"Have eaten their food for over a decade. Roast pork and char sui used to be spectacular but since a couple of years back I have not been happy with my walk-in orders of these dishes. They tend to give pieces with mostly fat and void of meat. They also skimp on giving pieces with crispy skin. Just be careful what they give you when you order take out."}
{"text":"Their roasted duck is amazing, crispy skin no fat meat juicy and don't have strong  smell like other ducks. I ordered roasted duck noodle soup and beef brisket noodle soup. Both are tasty but I like duck more. Beef is a bit dried not as juicy as other restaurants I've been too. Overall I was happy :)"}
{"text":"BBQ Chinese meat!  To start, they have a complimentary soup. It's chicken broth with bits of carrots, melon and chicken with dried lemon.   They're best known for their BBQ meat. 3 kinds of BBQ meat is $17, 2 kinds is $13 (duck, chicken, pork, spareribs, wings, cuttlefish).   There are other Chinese dishes (rice, fried noodles, congee, meat and vegetables dishes), but it's typical. Nothing special. Maybe even a bit pricier.   To finish, there's a complimentary dessert. Red bean soup.   Tea is too bitter. All 8 dishes totalled $110 + tip.  Decor is average. Washrooms aren't the cleanest. Most waiters can't speak English well. They sometimes run out of certain dishes (e.g spareribs)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my folks. Sam Woo BBQ is one of the more well known Chinese restaurants in Scarborough. They are known for their BBQ take outs and huge line ups on the weekend. We were seated quickly as we came for a late lunch. The restaurant isn't what you call a super decorated place, as they are more well known for their food than their decor. Restaurant is alright in terms of being clean, can't expect much for a place that has been in the neighbourhood for 30+ years.   Onto the food, my folks and I ordered a home style stir fry vermicelli and a Singaporean style stir fry rice noodle. These came out not long after and it came out piping hot. I find out one way to prove the skill of the chef is when their stir fry came out not too oily. These guys know their business. Both dish are flavourful but not overpowering. The home style vermicelli was just right in terms of flavour. The Singaporean rice noodle was very strong in flavour and very tasty.   Will come back again to try other dishes. Good job on maintaining standards."}
{"text":"I just spent $60 at this place & I've never been so disappointed with a meal before in my life. It's not like I didn't read the reviews. I did, & they were mainly positive. It's not like I don't like Asian food. I do, & I've enjoyed Canadian Chinese food many times in the past. How is it possible that every dish I bought tastes extremely nasty & there's not 1 dish out of the 6 I purchased that I want to taste twice even though I'm extremely hungry right now. It's annoying that a place like this has 4+ stars. I don't care about service. I'm taking it go usually anyways. I care only about great food and I'm willing to spend more to get it. This is the 3rd time in the past 4 months that I decided to try an authentically Asian place in around the Markham area that left me more than a little disappointed. The Dumpling House and Congee Queen were the last 2 places where I could not stomach eating the food I bought.  So on this visit to Sam Woo BBQ I thought I'd play it safe and try dishes that I'm familiar with from all the times I was left satisfied after eating at Chinese Canadian restaurants.  The Food: Won Ton Soup- Dumplings stuffed with shrimp. That's it. 2 whole shrimp inside a Dumpling. Looked gross, smelled gross, took a sip of the super salty broth & into the trash it went.  Chicken fried rice- They gave me a ton of this stuff. Chicken pieces are long, thin like shoelaces and curled up. I don't trust the chicken and the rice is yellow and very bland.  Spring rolls- way too greasy. I took a bite and it's like I downed a shot of canola. I squeezed it and oil came dripping out.  Cantonese's chow mean- the uncleaned shrimp grossed me out. The scallops were mushy. The chicken looked radioactive. The flavour was unpleasant.   Sweet & sour chicken- fried, tough, chewy, chicken pieces. Really didn't enjoy the taste. I'd much rather of had chicken balls from a Chinese food restaurant.  BBQ pork- ok so this wasn't half bad. I did end up taking a second bite of it."}
{"text":"Take out Chinese BBQ at its finest. Roast duck and pig with crackling skin. Savoury and sweet charsiu(BBQ pork) and chicken wings. Order by the lb, point to what you desire, witness the cleaver smash and slice your meat as juices run over the wooden chopping block, pay the ladies at the till in cash, and rush home to enjoy some of the best BBQ north of Austin, Texas."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch with my daughter and her friend at this restaurant after an afternoon of cleaning cars.  I happen to just bring $50.00 for the eat out.  Our bill was $51.70, so I did not have enough on my own but my daughter's friend had $2.00 in her pocket.  So it was just enough to pay the bill.  Out of courtesy, I went to the the woman cashier to apologize that, I did not bring enough money for tip, and I said, next time when I come again, which we do often maybe 5 times a month.  The woman at the cash said to me, \"where is the tip?\" after explaining to her the situation.  I said, I am sorry, I did not have enough because I just brought $50.  She looked at me without any emotion and she spoke Chinese to the waiter, and they had a dialogue.  Then she turned to me and said, \"you have to tip for the waiter\".  I said, I am just explaining to you and apologized that there is just enough money to pay the bill, you want me to leave my car to pay for tip?  I was so mad and annoyed because since when it was mandatory to tip?  And had I just left without explaining which I find rude because I thought they value customers being a regular, it would have been okay.  I do not know if this restaurant have learned Good Manners and Good Customer Service they seem to have missed the Memo on that subject.  Let me spell this out to everyone, avoid the place, there are three words to describe the people there, RUDE, RUDE, RUDE!!"}
{"text":"Sam Woo BBQ is one of my top choices when it comes to BBQ meats. They have been so consistent over the years in serving succulent and savoury BBQ meat, which leaves customers the constant urge to re-visit this restaurant. It is split into half dine-in restaurant and take-out section.  They offer the usual BBQ Duck, Chicken, and Pork. Roasted Pork, Soya Chicken, Pork Sausages, Chicken drum sticks, tofu and other hot food items. The staple item are the BBQ Pork and Roasted pork. The BBQ pork is best when it prepared half lean, half fatty, while maintaining the tender and juiciness with each bite. The outside layer is BBQ'd to perfection, capturing a subtle charred nuance. The skin the of the Roasted pork is so crispy, separated with a thin layer of fat, leaving you with a large chunk of tender meat to feast on. It is heaven when combined with the oyster sauce.  Highly recommended when you're on the go and want to grab something to bring home for lunch.dinner."}
{"text":"food is delicious, portion is good and service is fantastic. Too bad I didnt get to try bbq tho.. they were all sold out.."}
{"text":"Sam Woo BBQ is a quick meal choice for me whenever I need a Chinese BBQ fix and I'm in the area. The place is relatively clean and the food is decent enough. The BBQ can be hit or miss depending on what time of day you go (though I'm sure that applies to most restaurants as well). The service here is decently friendly enough.  The menu is mainly Cantonese dishes so you'll find items like Congee, fried noodle, bbq dishes, and others. I've had the Chinese bbq and it's mediocre. I find little BBQ shops to be much better, but this place does offer more dishes. The wonton noodles here are decent. Congee is very oily and though flavorful, wasn't nearly as good as other places. They have some decent chicken wings here as well.   They also have a late night menu after 9pm that offers you discounted dinner dishes that look pretty good. They have afternoon lunch specials, even on weekends that are good for those who are always eating a late lunch."}
{"text":"It's been many years since I've been to Sam Woo BBQ. My last visit, to their Alton Towers location, was probably the worst service I've experienced. Maybe it's no wonder that location closed a long time ago.  There is something old-school about Sam Woo. It's one of very few Chinese restaurants I've been to in recent years that starts you off with complimentary house soup. It's a simple but tasty pork broth. Not bad.  We ordered BBQ duck (of course), a beef dish with black fungus, lily roots, and mushrooms in a hot pot, deep fried spicy squid, taro with Chinese sausages, and sweet and sour pork (a last minute addition). They were out of stuffed tofu. That's a lot of food for three people! We had leftovers.  The duck was delicious, as expected, seasoned and cooked just right. The beef dish was also delicious. It's the first time I've had lily roots (gim jim) from a restaurant. Maybe I just didn't know what to order. The squid was also quite good, better than average, but not the best I've had. The taro dish had a coconut flavour and was okay but not really to my taste. I probably wouldn't order it again. The sweet and sour pork was good.  Our meal ended with a sweet orange flavoured soup, another old-school throwback. Overall, the food was very good but not outstanding. The service was good."}
{"text":"This is a typical Cantonese restaurant, good dishes. The price is reasonable, and the soup after meals is delicious. The location is good, close to foody mart."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 BBQ meat platter (roast pig, BBQ pork and roast duck), yeung chow fried rice and veggies w/ oyster sauce. The roast duck was tender and flavorful w/ a paper thin crispy skin, the roast pig was tender, moist w/ a light, crispy, crackling skin and the BBQ pork was tender, moist and tasty. All 3 were excellent. The fried rice was good, not at all oily and the veg did its job of helping maintain the mask of health amongst all the meats. Bonus braised beef soup was provided at no cost. Will be back often."}
{"text":"It is definitely one of my go-to authentic Chinese restaurant (maybe only one? LoL) .... My family members ALWAYS order takeout Chinese BBQ (BBQ pork, BBQ duck, squid and jellyfish...) for the past 10+ years. We have never eaten in the restaurant until my niece had a bday dinner here for dinner this year feb 2017. My husband, kids and I had a fav restaurant closed down and didn't have a 'decent' Chinese restaurant that was reasonable to go-to. Now we do!!! (Just FYI, I am Chinese and hubby is an HK).  Restaurant decor: as one mentioned, we come here for the food.  Waiters/waitress: pretty attentive considering the fact it's a Chinese restaurant. Friendly.  Washroom: could be cleaner...  Food: almost anything we ordered was decently made.   Must try: squab? I call it pigeon...damn amazing. It's like a deep fried mini Peking duck LoL. Comes with side dipping of salt/pepper and Worcester sauce. Very popular. They do run out.                 Jellyfish (make sure you ask for a vinegar dipping sauce...it's for     pig feet. Spicy and sour...YuM).                 Any BBQ meat/seafood from the BBQ area is awesome. Especially the cuttlefish with soya sauce! (BBQ pork don't get lean meat as too dry. Needs a bit of fat. BBQ pig, same. Best part is the ribs/bones; flavorful. BBQ duck is good. BBQ chicken wings - so damn flavorful. Delious.)                  I love sour/vinegary dishes. I'd recommend the porkchops with Chinese black vinegar. I ordered this 3 times and pretty consistent. Moist and flavorful.  Too many dishes to recommend. Tried many dishes here and I find it pretty good. Been here like 10+ times last 6 months. Would come here more often if I had the chance to.  Price is decent. Food is good and consistent. IMO."}
{"text":"When the co-workers come up to my desk say it's Woo time! I automatically know we're off to the take-out counter at Sam Woo's BBQ.   This place is a bit of a funny one - because I used to come here so often when I was a child and then we stopped coming because it was deemed too far by the parents as higher quality places opened up closer to home.  But this place is practically an institution because it has been around for so long. Also, to be perfectly honest with you, not much has changed for this place, including the staff.  I would have to say though you would need to pick and choose your food, because some of the food is pretty good, while the other stuff is ok, but I wouldn't say so delicious that you have to go and get it.  They have a late night special which is pretty for the decent for the price you get, you get a congee, with a chef choice of BBQ meats (translation: whatever they couldn't sell for the day) with a fried rice or noodle dish, with a plate of veggies with oyster sauce and another dish of your choice from a list. (I would go the pepper salt fried squid)  But lately, I've been hitting this place up for lunch and i usually head straight to the takeout counter, which is cash-only. Typically I order Roast Duck noodle Soup, I usually go for the ho fun, but others I know swear by their lai fun. Their BBQ Combo (fan hup) is usually a good deal as well, depending on what you want - but you can get a choice of two or three types of BBQ. Lunch take out specials can be up to $5 plus taxes as well and is also an excellent deal.  Typical rule of thumb - arrive early for lunch, I find 11:30 is the sweet spot on weekdays as the parking lot isn't as crazy as a Mad Hatter's Tea party and the BBQ is freshly out and ready for the days selling and there aren't as many line-ups, but as it inches closer to Noon, things to pick up."}
{"text":"as good as it gets.  this site is a nicer version of sam woo BBQ vs the coffee shop version of sam woo. the Dim Sum was quite nice. their service is on the slow side. I guess its a bit different than in the US, where most of the food (Dim Sum) were pre-heated and its on the cart wheeling around to get your attention. where here, they'll steam it once you order the food.  The nice part of the food from this restaurant, they don't use too much salt. where in canada, most of the food are just plain salty. (canadian consume more salt than average american) chicken feet, hm.. its not to my liking.  the egg custard is as good as golden gate bakery in SF shrimp with rice noodle (wrap) was excellent. (They don't burry it with soy sauce) the congee also very nice ( I ordered the seafood congee) the spicy dumpling was quite nice (too much soy sauce but not enough heat to make it spicy)  and last the steam bbq bun is much more to be desire (too sweet on the filling), but the bun it self is not bad."}
{"text":"A little pricey for a 2 pound lobster, but a great $7 lunch special!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ pork. Prices are higher but definitely worth every penny. Service could have been better but the food makes up for it. Their congee is probably one of the tastiest in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ duck and char siu. Both were very poor quality, no veggies on the side. Told the waitress, she said it's like that sometimes. Seriously, you have the word BBQ in your restaurant name. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Service was abysmal at the start but it got better over the course of the meal. The peking duck along with the hoison sauce, crepes, and the veggies were good although a bit small. The rest of the dishes were good as well."}
{"text":"i been here since i was a kid, a very excellent bbq restaurant that has never lowered their standard, since it first open, every bbq dish comes with their secret formula that drives me back to their restaurant every time i have this craving of roasted meats.  some dishes that sam woo i would recommend is BBQ, Duck, Chicken, Pork , and steam fish  they usual have very fast service and excellent quality put into ever dish  go try it out you wouldn't be unimpressive"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese BBQ I've ever had anywhere. The roast pork is done right. Where some places use hot oil to crisp the skin, this one is actually roasted to perfection creating thin crispy skin that can be snapped off and eaten like chips. The meat is juicy and not too fatty. The BBQ pork is also done very well, with a beautiful sticky, sweet, and caramelized glaze over tender meat. The wings are probably my favorite with the same glaze as the pork. They leave on the little wing tips which are great for chewing skin off of for some bonus flavors if you're into that. For take out, just get in line immediately in front of you as you enter the place. Everything here is sold by weight at a reasonable price. My only issue with this place is the consistency. The flavors seem to change from day to day, but I haven't figured out any patterns. For example, sometimes the wings have a thinner sauce (see pics) whereas sometimes the wings have a thicker, stronger tasting sauce which is my preference. The thin sauce one is good too, but the thick sauce is f'ing fantastic with a garlicy flavor that's more complex and stronger. Pro tips: 1) ask them not to cut up the roast or BBQ pork. That way it doesn't dry out as much on the ride home and they're also forced to give you a fresher piece rather than something that's been sitting around. 2) Get the ginger and green onion sauce which is an oil-based salty sauce that goes perfect with the roast pork for added flavor. Although the plaza has a huge parking lot, the place is perpetually busy, so grab parking wherever and walk, no run, if need be. It's located directly across from the Mc Donald's which is at the northern end of the plaza."}
{"text":"The theory is that a Big Mac should taste the same in any McDonalds.   Well I can't say that is true but if you want to set your watch to the consistency of a restaurant - Sam Woo BBQ would be the one.   I have been a customer of this place since I started dating my future wife back in 1990.  At least three people in the restaurant and take out today have been here all that time.   In 23 years not *ONE* dish's flavor has changed by even the slightest bit.   From noodles to rice to half roasted duck to canned pop to watermelon in the summer and oranges all other times ...  consistency rules!  Over the years we have tried other Chinese restaurants similar to Sam Woo - they are either meh or if they are half decent, you go there one day and either the place is under new management or the doors are locked for not paying rent the past six months.    The Five Star Caveat - I have been to far more expensive restaurants -- shark fin soup, fine linen, two sets of colored chopsticks.  But for pure value, freshness, taste and consistency - nothing comes close to Sam Woo.  And yes sometimes you do want something different and we do go elsewhere.  But when you get the craving - and want those signature dishes you've had for over two decades - this is the place.  Originally we always ate in, then had kids and shifted mostly to takeout - int he past few years as a family we have ate in again.  The restaurant isn't big - but there are various table sizes - so never let the line up at 7-8pm fool you - party of 4 or less get the small tables - many are waiting for the larger tables.  The tables have plastic table clothes for quick removal and for pop they bring a can and a glass which I prefer but they also bring tea.  At the end of the meal you are treated with free orange or watermelon/cantaloupe slices depending on the season    * The Regulars we recommend: #27 Hot and sour soup (spicy) \"bowl\"  we haven't found any other version out there that tastes as nice as here. #145 Shredded chicken fried rice - though in the past few years we have shifted to just plain rice.  A fav of mine - just the right amount of salt and it NEVER has that \"fried rice\" burnt flavor. #76 Beef w/Green Pepper and Black Bean Sauce #61 Steamed (ranch) chicken with Vegetables - typically with bok choy and comes with a lovely ginger/green onion in oil sauce #62 Deep Fried Chicken (though we tend to get the former) #113 Cantonese Style Fried Noodles.  (Alternative #121 BBQ Fried Noodle for take out).  #58 Deep fried squid with chili and spicy salt - my all time favorite - once I had this years ago I was hooked for life and anytime I see a \"deep fried squid\" in any Chinese restaurant I have to see if it compares to Sam Woo's -- none do.  Without a doubt one of the best fried squid dishes I have ever tasted.  Check out my tip on re-heating.  For special occasions get #32 Sauteed Lobster with Ginger &  Green Onion (seasonal price).  They bring the lobster to show you then cook it up (~1.5LB) - they automatically chop it into smaller pieces and it tastes amazing.    * The Meats Most places don't have this take out component ... on the restaurant menu: #3 Roasted Duck \"half\" though I see now a 3rd \"regular\" pricing.  (I always ask for \"the neck\" .. one time they included the beak as a joke I guess - I laughed).   #12 BBQ Pork (in the restaurant it comes with peanuts) - they chop it up into thin slices - normally we ask for no sauce (okay without it) #11 Roasted Pig (I tend to get \"regular\" v. lean) - comes with hoisin sauce (this is the pig that is hanging and they just shave off a couple of LBs for takeout) #14 BBQ Wings (couple of times)  * Take out noodles & rice alternatives From 11-5pm they offer smaller noodle and rice combos - great for lunches.  In the past couple of years we started buying these dishes due to the lower price and I we can get two different kinds of noodles.  See my tip on noodle sizes.  Regular noodles include:  Singapore; spareribs (a new favorite) and a satay chicken (not in full menu?).  * Wings anyone? Not sure when (see pictures) they offer wings various counts.  Weird flavor choices but tried the Sam Woo; Satay and Sweet and Sour - I liked the Satay the least but all in all - great wings and flavor throughout.  They include the tips too (not part of the count).  Great value - and we were surprised.  A dry/non-saucy wing.  I am sure if Yelp was available in the 90s I would have had more than 100 check ins by now.  Currently non-existent due to myself only recently starting the check in process - we'll get there eventually.  Finally ... so it is 8pm on Christmas Eve and you were planning to eat at Red Lobster and they won't let you in because they want to close early for the staff - now what?  Well you know 100% Sam Woo BBQ is open and ... away we go!!!!!!  Regular since 1990."}
{"text":"Sam Woo BBQ is a good place if you want a late night snack as it is open till 12 am on weekdays and 1 am on weekends.  Of course there are a lot other places that opens later, but if you are into some traditional Cantonese food: wonton noodles, BBQ and congee, Sam Woo definitely would satisfy that urge!  We shared a Congee, BBQ Duck Noodle and Veggie in Oyster Sauce as a midnight snack. Nothing to write home about but everything tasted decent.   Right next to Foody Mart so parking here can be quite tricky during prime shopping hours... Which I definitely would avoid!"}
{"text":"Favourite dish to get is the steamed tilapia. The fish becomes soft and tender and tastes impeccable. The areas around the neck and check are softest and tastes the best so save it for last.   The BBQ pork and roasted pork is one of the finest in the GTA. It is of high quality as they treat their food with care and have a special way of preparing it. During Chinese holidays, the line up for the BBQ pork is really long and never dies down."}
{"text":"Delicious Duck! Order this for sure.  Peking style or regular you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We were here on 2 separate occasions, the second time there was a pretty long wait. There is a special menu by the kitchen, buts it's only in Chinese. The food arrived extremely fast and was rather tasty!  We had chesnut chicken, basa fillet with veggies and bok choy.  The protium size was also decent, the 3 of us couldn't finish.  The price wasn't too bad either.  Beside the wait time, this is a decent place for a quick dinner!  Recommended."}
{"text":"Best late night spot, They got specials after 9:30pm. bbq duck is amazing!"}
{"text":"Happy new year's eve! Had a quick dinner there and had their snake soup (bloody expensive now $30), prawn on fried noodle and fried/sauteed cod.  Snake soup was a bit on the salty side, but the chips that come with it buffer the taste.  Although I didn't get the \"heat\" I was expecting from drinking the soup though.  Prawn on fried noodle is good, but a bit too much ginger for my tastes.  Fried/sauteed cod was so-so, I think I should have gotten something else.  It wasn't boneless either.  Food and service is still good, just the price is a bit expensive, but at least they support VISA."}
{"text":"A staple for Chinese people in the GTA, especially those in the Scarborough & Markham areas.  They've been around forever and make some of the best Chinese bbq meats.  I particularly love duck and and crispy-skinned pork.  But their south Cantonese dishes (\"siu chow\") and other dishes are also wonderful.  My faves:  *sweet and sour pork *ginger and green onion oyster hotpot *shrimp fried egg *garlic stir fried veggies *ginger stir fried veggies *preserved meats with chinese veggies *shrimp paste & squid with chinese veggies (the tube-stalked kind) *pepper and fermented tofu with chinese veggies *fish and tofu hotpot *steamed fish"}
{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times in the past 5 years, but it's always been in the wintertime. Why? Because they make this really good goat stew that you can only get at this time of year.  It's not even on the menu, you'll just have to ask the server for it ;)  They bring a giant bubbling clay pot to your table along with a burner. Inside, you'll find bamboo shoot, water chestnuts, ginger, and of course a whole lot of goat meat on-bone. You get a platter of greens to toss into the pot as well.  It serves at least two hungry people and is a pretty comforting meal to warm up with in the winter."}
