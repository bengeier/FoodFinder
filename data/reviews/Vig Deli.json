{"text":"I had two diametrically opposed experiences at this \"deli.\" My first visit was pleasant enough as I had good, homemade latkes and a Chicago hot dog! I'm telling you the latkes were really good (perfectly spiced, moist and crispy), and my Chicago dog was prepared just right with just enough char!
On the second visit the the latkes were nauseatingly bad. They were the worst latkes I've ever had! Terrible flavor and preparation. Did a two-year-old make this? Were these made of rotten potatoes and onions mixed with garbage? Feh!!!!
I also ordered the pastrami! This pastrami was obviously low-grade store-bought value-brand drek. Did this even come from a brisket, let alone a cow? It was possibly the worst pastrami I've ever had. It tasted like a cheap hot dog, and that, my friend, is not how the sexiest of the cured meats is supposed to taste! I would not chance eating their pastrami again!"}
{"text":"I will admit im not big on deli food and a bit inexperienced with them, however, of the few here in vegas i have tried this is by far the best."}
{"text":"Walked around and around trying to find a decent priced meal and I found this Deli.  Hey, after being in Vegas for a few days and spending your money on cabs your shouldn't had and still want to gamble, this is the place to be.

Once again, on this trip I had the philly cheese steak.  I guess I didn't have enough from my trip at Mandalay.  This sammich is DELISH!  Over flowing of meat, has enough caramelized green peppers and onions and enough cheese.  Now that's how you make it!  I was amazed for a lil person like me, I inhaled it and was definitely satisfied."}
{"text":"I get vouchers here since I have a players card. The service is always hit or miss with this place. The food is decent but overly priced."}
{"text":"damn great food.everything that i had on the menu so far was delicious.,cooked perfectly.even the chicken soup and chili rocks.the best is the philly steak,burgers,onion rings....as of 4/23/11 I had a change of hear solely due to their french dip....it was below sub par as it was tasteless and bland,,only when i brought it home and had to add REAL spices and such to it that it actually kind of somewhat tasted ok,,and that was only beacause i added the needed and necessary spices to the sandwhich....oregano,pepper,onions,etc,,,and i do have to question their service lately...its gone from bad to worse..takes almost an hour just to get something other than soup and even that is questionable now...other than that....the food that i DID try was great,,,just be prepared to add your own spices to it..seriously."}
{"text":"Awful customer service from cooks chef and mod rovie my family stayed this weekend to treat our kids to a staycation we spent $100 on every meal both days the morning crew did a terrible job from the rotten tomatoes on my lox platter my black over cooked steak my daughter and sons extremely burned bagels the attitude my husband received trying to explain to the chef the issues as well as the total disrespect from the chef that cursed him out for complaining the assistant front desk manager was as helpful as he could be since there was no higher manager in duty to speak too I will say that our dinner there later Sunday night was a completely different experience and thus literally night and day we hope that this is handled properly or at the very least an apology"}
{"text":"The Vig Deli is in the M Resort adjacent to the sports book. It is a typical deli offering dogs, burgers, pizza, sandwiches and everything to go along with them. You go to the counter and order by the number associated with your item. When your food is ready they call your number.

My wife and I each got the Nathans hot dog. We shared an order of fries and onion rings. If you are going to share you should just get one order. Each order is huge. The hot dog is very good and I do recommend it.

Everything else on the menu looked very good. But I cannot give an honest opinion on their taste. The only service you get is the clean up of the empty tables. The lady was very nice and helped us get a clean table."}
{"text":"Sampled this place while at the M Resort since me and my bud was hungry.  The place is just a regular deli but since we don't have much deli joints back home we decided to grab sandwiches.  Got the pastrami reuben sandwich that was recommended by the cashier and I don't know if it was because we were hungry or what but the sandwiches tasted good.  Nice sized portions of meat with no fat inside.  The bread was kinda cool too.  It seems that the bread is like a rye bread with a swirl of dark rye in the middle.  Expect to pay about 10 bux but definitely worth it for the quality of sandwich you are getting.  The workers are fast, and even though it's a walk up counter, they got workers that clear the tables and trash fast."}
{"text":"So I go into the Vig Deli and they no longer carry large pizzas. Now you can only get small pizzas which tastes nasty. They use too much dough and the consistency is gross. The sauce was dry and not tasty. They used to have really good pizza, unfortunately they are going down hill, Shame!"}
{"text":"Some of the best deli food ever.  A lot of good stuff on the menu.  HUGE portions."}
{"text":"This place is not a bad glorified fast food style eatery. There is a fair variety of items to choose from, however, the food can be hit or miss. Most recently I grabbed a burger and fries with a fountain drink. Fries were fresh and hot. Burger wasn't terrible but had too much of a char taste. It is a bit pricey for what is being offered as well. Burgers, fries and a drink hits just under $18."}
{"text":"It was ok until we refilled our drinks and the stupid bitch threw our pizza away. It was the kids pizza. She could see we were not finish."}
{"text":"Had the triple decker sandwich. Turkey with pastrami and provolone. Three stunningly beautiful slices of bread. Nom yummy I say. Huge portion with tons of flavor but not so ovwrwhelmimg that you have to wash it down with gallons of water.

Would not mind making that extra stop to visit this joint prior to entering the strip.  It is located within the \"M\" casino."}
{"text":"The N.Y. Steak Pita is the way to go. Can't go wrong. The Vig Deli is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We were headed to Hash House A Go Go only to find out they closed that location so we ate here instead. The food was delicious but way too overpriced for a deli sandwich. I got the Italian sub that had quite a bit of meat. My son got a slice of pizza that was probably the best priced thing on the menu. The slice was huge and only 5.99. Despite the food being delicious I  would probably only eat here again if it was the only thing open."}
{"text":"Not happy with this deli right now. 1st of all it wasn't busy. We ordered 2 simple  meals.  A cheeseburger & a tuna melt with provolone cheese. I picked up our food, stupid me for not checking it before We drove all the way home to the northwest in Centennial Hills because my so called  tuna melt didn't have any tuna on it just cheese. Not the 1st time we've been disappointed from there but this will be the last time I waste my money."}
{"text":"Quality has become very inconsistent. In our last two trips, they put out burnt or cold food and had to re-make it. Bad management."}
{"text":"Lots of items to choose from. Friendly service. Tasty treats, too. Cannoli's; really? Yes, that's right! Almost always open."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! My friend and I came here after happy hour at the Hostile Grape (Which is also GREAT BTW)! It's def. got the homemade Deli feel, but with a modern ambiance (being that it is in the M Resort). The tuna melt and the reuben (that I ordered) was DELICIOUS.  Perfect meat to bread ratio and a pickle on the side to compliment the meal. The bread was not overly fried up, so my hands didnt feel greasy after handling it. 

GREAT GREAT DELI! I wish they had more Vig Deli places in the valley."}
{"text":"We dropped by the M resort out of curiousity (since we've never been) and to grab a quick bite to eat on the way back home to la.  At first we lined up for buffet only to figure out that if we ate buffet, we'd spend around 2 hours, which would effectively put us in the main flow of traffic down back to la so we decided to try this place. 

wow, the servings here are huge!  we got the club sandwich, tuna sandwich, the philly cheesesteak, fries and onion rings.  i was honestly stuffed from only half of the philly cheesesteak and the others i was with couldn't even look at the second half of their sandwiches. the onion rings were huge and the serving size for the fries was enough for 4 people.  

the bus people were definitely on point with cleaning tables, and often would come around asking/helping many of the customers find seats.

you need to try this place out, they do not disappoint with the sandwiches."}
{"text":"My wife and I have an agreement... During college football season, Saturday is reserved for \"Joseph\" Day.  I usually get to the M resort and casino at 8:30am and stay until about 10pm to 11pm. (yes, about 13-14 hours)!  Usually the games are done by then.  Yes, i wish there were couches there with a \"blanky\".  

At the M's sportsbook, I have complimentary beer when I bet (usually order the Belgian Beers) and can watch over 30 something games.  In addition, I can manage my bets.  I love the M... they have odds for most of the casinos in vegas... What else can a guy ask for?

Anyways, when I am hungry, I usually swing over to the Vig Deli - few steps away from the Sportsbook.

It is a cozy.  Lines are a bit long during lunch time (as expected).  But, it is only a 5 minute or so wait.

Service - excellent.  The cashier is very sweet and the orders are takened and served pretty quick --  2-5 minute wait for the food.  

Meal -- well, it is pretty good.  So far, I would highly recommend:

a.  Egg, Ham, and Cheese.  Usually, they serve it on a bagel, but I prefer to have it on a French Bread.  It is not your McDonald's type of breakfast sandwich.  It is fresh and VERY Very good.  It cost about 5.99 or so.
b.  Footlong Chili dog with cheese - the dog is a bit salty; however, you kinda forget about it because the chili and cheese makes this a good buy.  Again, it is under $6.  

They also serve Philly Cheese Steaks and Burgers... will try that out another time.

Overall, this place is a great sports book deli (much better than SouthPoint -- kinda over priced over there and quality and is worst).  For the price and quality, I would highly recommend this place.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I always have the footlong here...while my hubby likes their salad.  It's very convenient to eat here while on a break from playing poker at M's poker room."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the Vig Deli.  The French fries are delicious as well as their sandwiches and salads.  We haven't had anything that isn't good there.  The pizza is also delicious.  I would recommend this place to anyone!  Just yummy!"}
{"text":"Somewhat difficult to rate something high or low when only trying one option, so this gets a 3 until I have tried more of their food. The foot-long Nathan dog comes on a bun, with a pickle on the side. That's it in the basket. The taste is pretty good, a lot denser that some other hot dogs, and certainly more spices were noted. Pricing is about right for casino food. The batter fried onion rings were tasty, and the batter actually stayed on the onion (so many places the batter separates from the onion). The large sized order was very sufficient for sharing, and the regular size could probably serve two people if they aren't heavy eaters. Refills on the soda, and that's always good.

I did not see a grand selection of \"deli\" sandwiches that I envision on a deli menu.

Overall, not wildly impressed, but must try some other things on their menu before I can make an overall opinion of their food. It's okay."}
{"text":"Ive been going by here for years to pick up food for the family.  They recently upped their game by doing a complete overhaul of their menu and adding some exotic food items.
The best of which is certainly the crispy fish tacos.  Definitely a must try, along with their pizza which always is a crowd pleaser!"}
{"text":"A BLT from here and hotdogs both delicious the onion rings suck though other than that it's okay if you're hungry and you're in the hotel"}
{"text":"I usually come here when I have some sort of food coupon from M Resort. The wait is never that long and while sometimes the person behind the counter can be a little rude, I just ignore it.

The wait for food doesn't take that long either and the portions are big. Recently, I ordered a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fries and there was so much pulled pork that it spilled out and I had to eat most of it with a fork. I'm not complaining about that though. Give me all the pulled pork! It was tasty, especially since I used a food coupon on it, and there was enough for me to take home leftovers."}
{"text":"The M resort tends to be a isolated island in more ways than one when you stay there. 

First of all, I absolutly love the place and it's high class. top shelf all the way, but it is... ON ITS OWN.

That being said, when you have had a drunken binge on the strip and it comes time to call the resort shuttle, while waiting 15-25 minutes for the shuttle to arrive and then venturing home on the seemingly endless 15-25 minute ride whilist being borderline puke drunk from the strip, it dawns on you that the \"quiet off strip\" location is not that appealing anymore.

So, what better way to cure your drunk munchies by eating a big ol' greasy deli-style sandwich at the Vig.

I ate late night munchies at the vig all three nights I stayed at the M, and all I can remember is that I ordered a Reuben one of the nights, Can't remember any of the other sandwiches I ordered haha!

-Ken Bernanke"}
{"text":"WOW! The sandwiches here are off the hook! Not expected considering it's sitting inside of a mega resort. My wife had a club sandwich and I had a pastrami sandwich. Both were excellent! The bread was fresh, the meats were utterly tender, and oh so flavorful. You get a whole pickle with your sandwich, not just a spear. Here's a tip if you want your sandwich quicker. Have a drink at the 32 bar right next door and order your food from there. It took less than ten minutes for our sandwiches to get to us after we ordered them. That's fast considering the line for this place is always super long."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I wasn't expecting much but when I saw a pic of the Reuben I had to try. It was fantastic with a side order of onion rings. I don't understand the some of the low ratings. I will be back. Want to try the fish and chips next time."}
{"text":"It's not bad at all! We come to eat here because it's Christmas and the line for buffet it is crazy as early as 5:30.  So we kind of give it a try here. But surprisingly all the dishes are good.  I know they kind of like fast food style no server and you might need to clean up the table by yourself. But the food quality is 5 star. So if you are looking for option beside the m buffet like me.  Give this one a try."}
{"text":"It's shameful for a place as this, \"Vig Deli\" (inside M Resort) that cook/server doesn't even have common sense...serving burnt pizza to the customer???!!! C'mon??!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place - I love the other restaurants at The M, but I cannot.   Food is so-so, high end bar food.  That's not the problem.  It's the service.    I wind up here when the other M restaurants are crowded and I keep hoping it will be different but it's always lousy.   Generally they take forever to serve and about half the time they screw up the order.  Of course when this happens the server is nowhere to be seen.   I'm guessing this is where they put the rookies and anyone that shines gets sent to one of the other restaurants.  That's just a theory.  Nevertheless, it's routinely awful.   (Last time they comped me it was so bad)
 You can do better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Usually a great place to grab a quick bite.  Today was not that day.  Watering down the salad dressing?  Come on!"}
{"text":"Not sure why there is so many bad reviews but this little place is kind of a hidden Gem. The food options are to die for I literally can never decide because there is just so many things one can get! After a day at the pool this place really hit the spot we cleaned our plates!"}
{"text":"we stopped here on our way home from Vegas and I have to say it was pretty darn good!!! the order is pretty filling and they give you a lot of fries. 

I ordered the hot dog and it was a little salty but I still enjoyed it. my fiancé got the Philly cheese steak and he loved it! it was a little bland but adding some sauce on it helped. the burger was also nice and juicy so no complaints there. the pastrami was to die for as well. very juicy and filling. 

we got a side of cheese with our fries and omg was it good! they we're perfect with our meal!!! my friends got onion rings and they loved it. I personally don't like onion rings so I didn't try it. 

the service was excellent and fast. I would definitely come back here for a quick bite!!!"}
{"text":"We were considering eating lunch at Studio B Buffet for Thanksgiving, but the line was too long and 2hr wait. Yikes! Saw Vig Deli across the casino floor and so we decided to give it try. 

I was not expecting much from a Casino Deli, but the Philly Cheese steak, fish n chips and chicken caeser salad exceeded my expectation and were pretty good. The bread on Philly was soft, the onions/peppers were cooked really well, lots of meat with melted provolone cheese on top. Good crisp texture on fish n chips and fries were on point. Prices weren't too bad either - considering you're in Vegas! Plus our food arrived quickly and dining area is clean. Definitely satisfied our hunger after driving 4hrs from LA and good decision indeed.

Note - They actually offered Thanksgiving meal special for lunch with all the fixins for about $15. Saw some people having it and looked good too, but passed because we were visiting family in Vegas for Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"One of the many affordable restaurants in the M Resort. Great food at great prices. You might think it's a quick deli kind of place but you definitely get restaurant style quality and service. Simple game foods like burgers, hot dogs, fries, and pastas but wonderfully prepared. Onion rings are yum! great place!"}
{"text":"The Texas chili alone was worth stopping, so yummy! My husband got the club sandwich and the meat was fresh and delicious, I got the steak pita wrap, and although I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese (I think it was goat) it was still great! Glad we came!"}
{"text":"Let's review this for what it is.  It's a deli, with simple food, in the middle of a nice resort in Henderson.  I've only been here for food in the wee hours of the morning, you know, when you need a little something to keep you going.  I had a roast turkey sandwich and fries.  Both were tasty but definitely super simple and plain.  Like for the sandwich we're talking bread, lettuce, tomato, meat, bread, nothing else.  That cost me a little over $13.  Too pricey for what it was but not terrible when you need some food.  The staff were all super courteous and even joked around which was refreshing.  The place was also clean and not bad to look at.  All in all, the definition of average."}
{"text":"I use to come here with my mother and I a lot, but we don't have time. But when we do, its a treat coming here and order our favorite meals. Philly cheesesteak is one of there amazing meals. Too many flavors going on your mouth and its just finger licking good. I forgot this one dish, it's a sandwich with a swirl on the bread... You have to try one, it's soo good it hits the spot. I always order there Caesar salad, A lot of condiments on the top giving it some texture and flavors, it's mouthwatering good. When your get there it's going to take a while cause some times where is always a line... That's good that's means they have great food! And once you order have to wait for your food to be made ... So you know it's fresh and hot for you."}
{"text":"I really like the Vig Deli.  They have a great selection of food.  Be prepared the serving sizes are a bit on the large size come with an appetite. 

They have salads, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches and amazing pizza. The most expensive thing on the menu is 10.99 so you won't break the bank. 

My favorite is the French Dip. The sandwich is packed with meat, this is not for someone on a diet.  My hubs gets the pizza quite a bit and says it is AWESOME!

We pretty much have tried everything on the menu and haven't been disappointed."}
{"text":"My parents love this casino it is their favorite place to go to get that gambling itch on. My mom would stay here for almost 24 hours out on the casino floor draining her pockets away just for a moment of excitement when she would reach her bonus rounds on the penny machines. She might as well play $1 slots because she would be max each time, she just think her chances were higher. When her wallet gets empty she would stop by this place located right in front of the casino entrance next to the sports bar. Her favorite sandwhich would be the Philly Cheese Steak. Her and my dad would share it all the time. They took me here once and I had the roast beef beef sandwhich. The portion sizes are generous, the fries are always fresh. I also ordered some onion rings, some of the best I have ever tried! I love their onion rings. What's funny is I have two of my old coworkers working here! haha! - The M though is a great place , I love the decor. The service here is good and the cashier name Rovie is kinda ditzy... lolz.. jk... Shes awesome, make sure you tip her!"}
{"text":"For a deli the food here really prepared well with what seems to be quality ingredients. This isn't just a deli, but with a menu that spans from sandwiches to wings, salads to tacos and much more."}
{"text":"They have a lot of choices that were good for being in a casino. We tried a lot of stuff there also that were good. The chicken Cesar wrap was fresh and crunch salad leaves and really good Cesar. We had the chicken strips and French fries and onion rings and the nachos. Of everything the nachos were by far our favorite. I got them with steak and it was delicious! I would go back here anytime."}
{"text":"I love the cheesesteak and eat here occasionally.  Amazing cheesesteak, but a little expensive for what it is.  Good fries."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying, this was my first time at this resort and was pleasantly surprised until my experience at Vig Deli with \"chef Rene\", if you could even call him that. 

I was traveling with parents and grandmother this weekend and we decided to come downstairs to get some dinner before hitting the slots. This restaurant has a large menu which makes for a very busy kitchen--I get it. So after waiting 20 minutes from the time we ordered, our order was finally called and everything seemed fine except they were missing our order of fries. My mother took back the tray to our family and I offered to wait. There was a gentleman next to me waiting for his food as well and said \"I don't know why they don't just give you my order of fries\", since his food was sitting getting cold as it had not been called out for him yet. He said there were items missing so it made sense. I just looked at him and said \"that's okay sir it shouldn't be much longer, it's just some fries\". Well, boy was I wrong. 

I waited maybe ten minutes and my mom came back up to ask the woman handing out the orders about how much longer. The woman working asked good ol' \"chef Rene\", how much longer and he asked the order number and \"what are they waiting for\". Now, mind you this kitchen layout is not great for staff or customers because you hear the interaction between the cooks and it's of course a lot of yelling and can sound abrasive although they're doing their job. Well, here's where I got upset with the customer service at this restaurant. \"Chef Rene\" came over and slung the fries at us. Now, when I say that, I mean it as the basket almost flew off the counter and fries flew off and hit my mom waiting there. He said \"here are your fries\", with an awful attitude as he tossed them off. It was so rude and honestly just a d**k move in my opinion.  

Everyone waiting for their food saw what happened and I wish I was kidding, but I heard people gasp! Because they were really surprised by the action. All he had to do was say, oh I don't know, something along the lines of \"sorry for the delay miss, enjoy\" or \"thank you for your patience, here are your fries\". I get it, it's a basket of FRIES, but that's not what it's about, it's about the customer service. Now I work in hospitality management for Marriott International and something like this, would have a \"chef\" gone in our brand. THAT, is not how you gain customer satisfaction. But what makes it worse is that I walked over to him, asked his name as he replied \"chef Rene\". I simply asked \"is there a reason you had to sling that at my mom with such an attitude?\" The guy wouldn't even look me in the eye, let alone say sorry. He said \"we're really busy and I have a lot of orders\". Uh, well yes I get that sir since you're working in a restaurant in Las Vegas---makes sense! I stood there and I said \"wow, you won't even look me in the eye. You won't even apologize will you?\" He said \"if you're upset, write a letter! WRITE A LETTER!\". Yea, a grown man calling himself a chef, yelling this at a young female and her mother in front of not only customers, but his staff as well. 

Absolutely ridiculous. He found it more logical to yell at us to write a letter than simply apologize; is it honestly that difficult? \"Chef Rene\", I could care less what your background is, or how you got to this position in your career but what I do care about, is your lack of respect in the way you treat people. If you can't take the heat, then get out of the kitchen; literally. 

This honestly ruined our dinner experience there and I felt bad because the other people waiting  felt involved as well and it may have made them feel uncomfortable. His actions and his words were nothing less than rude and nowhere near hospitable. You work for a restaurant inside a resort sir, what do you expect. To me, regardless of your position in that hotel, it comes down to how you treat your guests and if they will ever return, and based off of mr chef Rene, I might just take the extra drive and pay more to be on the actual strip where I have never experienced this kind of treatment. 

It all comes down to how you treat other people, and actions always speak louder than words. In this case, he made it evident that he's horrible at guest satisfaction in both actions and communication."}
{"text":"We were looking for the Pasta Bar restaurant, and finally gave up because we couldn't find it, so we decided to eat here. Placed our order (2 hot dogs - simple) - waited 20 minutes. Numbers called, our number was passed and we started to wonder what happened to our order. We checked, and finally it came up - and the order was completely wrong - they loaded all of the toppings onto one hot dog, and left the other one with nothing on it - we couldn't even identify some of the stuff on the one with all of the toppings, but 1/2 of them weren't ordered by us. It would have taken another 20 minutes to reorder, and honestly, it wasn't worth the drama. We just left. Not going back."}
{"text":"alright! the chili cheese fries are not on the menu! if you ask , they will make them.  their gargantuan!  a great value for the price. 
it's a kitchen with all the fix ins! 
steak and eggs! fish and chips! pizza etc.  
quick snacks too! 
bbq pulled pork sandwich is mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch Monday Night Football. We got a great seat right in front of a big screen in the Sports bar - which actually is easy to do as there are plenty of screens and seating. We watched the entire game with no pressure from the staff as we only had burgers and ice tea and we weren't really ordering drinks. The cheeseburger and fries were good and our server was excellent and friendly. (our team won!) This is a great place to go to get off the Strip."}
{"text":"For simple food, this place is great!!! Chicago dog for 3 dollars!! Giant burgers for 7.  And cheap booze for five!!! All this without leaving the comforts of my hotel room.  And the best part to this place is the eye candy.  A guy can go blind looking at all the head lights blaring at cha!!!"}
{"text":"We ate here against my will and the food was surprisingly pretty good ^_^.  

El Hubby and I were supposed to eat at Studio B Buffet, but the line was too long and he didn't wanna wait, so he asked if we could just try Vig Deli instead. I ordered FISH TACOS $15 and CHEESE TOTS with a frown on my face (I was thinking of all the abundance of food I could've had at the buffet ugh!). 

We sat at a table and we got our food about 15 minutes or so. No too bad. I like that you can see staff cooking and preparing the food. I started grubbing and to my surprise the food was actually pretty dang delicious. My fish tacos came in 3 with huge pieces of fried fish. Fish was cooked perfectly. I asked for avocado slices on top and it was yummy! Cheese Tots were very tasty too. It was crunchy, hot and goey on the inside. 

Vig Deli serves your basic American and some international food. They have sandwiches, tacos, salads, soups, pizzas, steak, breakfast and etc. Staff were friendly and service was great! 

I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Matzo ball soup at any time is a wonderful thing."}
{"text":"Gross brisket. It was more fat and jelly like. The bbq sauce used was gross. The turkey burger was nasty too"}
{"text":"Fantastic french fries.  Thats all I wanted...and the orders are large!! Nice, fresh and crispy.  This spot is adjacent to the Sports Book.  Anytime I'm there? I'm getting some french fries.  I saw the onion rings on someone's plate.  They're ginormous!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We stay at the M all the time and I hadn't eaten there until my last stay in July. I wanted breakfast and it was past 10am (burgers and brews stops serving breakfast at 10) so thought I'd try it. Not expecting much from a casino deli. The lady who took my order was so amazing , Bonnie. She modified my food order and the chef made it to perfection. So great that I came back every morning for the rest of my trip. The cook remember me and was very friendly. They're chicken Caesar salad is also very good. Chicken is chopped into squares for perfect bites!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The night before last I had a chance to revisit the Vig Deli inside the M resort.  I've previously eaten here and found the deli to be exactly as described; a deli.  Now, this would be fine if it were located in an older, more run-down resort, however, this is the M.  I expected a little more the first time I ate and the same after this past experience.  

Basically, my major reservations about the Vig are:

1. No waiters - From an employment standpoint I feel this to be a way to tighten up the cost of labor.  If you want a counter order deli, put in a Capriottis.

2. There is no comparison between the Vig & Carnegie in Mirage.  The food, service, and portions are all justified in the price.  This brings on #3

3.  For the price, the M resort can do so much better; and does.  Almost every restaurant in the M, including the The Red Cafe is a better overall choice IMHO.  

Finally, I would like to summarize my review by saying that although, the Vig is a small blemish to the M resort on most key points.  The food is flavorful and quick.  If your at the sports book or playing around the resort and need a quick bite, you can do worse in the city."}
{"text":"Don't get the turkey burger! Contemplated dunking it in water cause it was so dry. Spent $13.00 for the driest and least flavorful food I have ever had. Waste of money and their frys are horrible. But who knows maybe their other food is alright. Good luck"}
{"text":"Hubby and I love the buffet at the M Resort but wanted a lighter meal. This is a fun sports-themed cafe with sandwiches, nachos, pizza, salads, etc. I got spaghetti with huge meatballs and my husband ordered a French dip sandwich with au jus plus a side of onion rings. The food was hot and tasty. I wish they had comfy booths instead of little tables with hard chairs. Good soda machine. You can watch sports on many nearby TVs."}
{"text":"Vig is a quick stop to eat if you're wandering around the M. I really like their food selection and everything is very good. Prices aren't outrageous for the portions you receive, and the food is fresh. The service was friendly, mostly self service. I love their foot long Chicago dogs. Not just like the real thing, but a taste. Their pizza slices are huge and tasty. Stop here if you're hungry and not in the mood for anything super fancy."}
{"text":"5 stars because the food is more then just a deli.

After a 3 day stay in Vegas and a diet of one junkie meal and lots of alcohol by the time we were ready to head back home we were really looking forward to an amazing buffet so we had to come to the M. Studio B is not only great but also wallet friendly. But by the time we came here on a Monday it was 2:50pm and the buffet was closing!! =( So I went to the bartender and checked out what kind of options we had. Red cup (their 24 hour restaurant) cafe was now closed forever because sneak peek for ya'll in October it'll be Hash House a go go!! If you've ever been you know it's a great replacement!! Yelp Hash House and if you get a chance you have to go and now there are 2 options in Las Vegas. Anyway, let me focus lol. So our only other option to eat was Vig Deli and I have to admit we were all disappointed because we've basically starved in Vegas and to be limited to a deli wasn't exactly something we were looking forward to. But we were starving and didn't want to head back to the strip and to hit stateline just was just too ghetto food for us. So we went to check it out.

The menu is up above and although it wasn't impressive at first sight, but if you really read all the possibilities they had some great options!! And I could eat a cow by that time and I basically wanted to order everything, but luckily my girlfriend felt the same way so we ordered things we could split. I got the pastrami sandwich and fries, my girlfriend got the spaghetti and meat balls (yes, I said spaghetti and meatballs!!), our other friends got pizza, hot wings, chicken salad sandwich, chili cheese fries and a cheeseburger. We basically managed to make our own buffet. The food was regular priced ($5-8 entrees) my lunch was basically $16 entree, fries and a drink which is a deal. But the food was Vegas HUGE helpings yes helpings it was a lot of food!! And everything we got was so yummy!! I'd have to say the spaghetti and meatballs looked like the platter from Lady and the Tramp w/ 3 giant meatballs but the 'tomato' sauce was so tasty and meaty not the typical marinara acidic taste. It was so good! I'm craving it right now!!! It was great w/ garlic bread to boot! So yea come here and try it it's not just a regular deli. I saw some orders other people got and wow. The meatloaf sandwich looked yummm it was stacked high!! The food is served in casual deli baskets but the food is sit down dining quality for a wallet friendly price. Yumm!! I will come back here but it'll make for a harder decisions since there's the Studio B buffet and soon to be Hash House a go go!! OMG, M you can make me an obese woman lol! ;P"}
{"text":"On a mission to find a late night meal with my cousin we came across the Vig Deli. Got the BBQ beef brisket and the steak pita wrap which we both decided to share(total of about $20). 
First had my half of the $10 tasteless wrap which I tried to help with Tabasco and ketchup. It sucked. Moved onto the beef brisket.. again it sucked! The globs of cold BBQ sauce tasted horrible and looked like it had been sitting for a while. With pure anguish I than like a madwoman dashed on some Tabasco and smeared on relish. Attempts were futile as we finally sat silently staring at the unfinished food deciding the best part of this meal was the cup of coca cola. Save your money and the space in your bellies I beg of you!"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative if you're super hungry and not willing to take on the lines at M Buffet or Hash House (two great places to eat, by the way), OR you have a huge craving for deli food. I've been here a couple of times, and the last time I came here we picked up food for the road trip back to Cali. 

The service is alright, the workers helpful and pretty friendly. The price of the food I think is a little bit on the pricey side for some of its deli items. My boyfriend ordered the Tuna Melt, which was delicious and I ordered the Pastrami sandwich and asked to add an over easy egg. The cashier said it was the first time anyone's ever asked for that, but she was happy to add it to my order. Both orders came with pickles (which I LOVE), but the only thing missing from the entire meal was sides. I wish their sandwiches came with at least fries. 

Note: if you do decide to get a sandwich to go with an egg order it at least over hard. It can get pretty messy on a road trip. 

Overall, this is still a great place for a pretty great tasting sandwich, but honestly I would probably get Hash House to go instead."}
{"text":"Vig Deli is (thanks to the change in operating hours of The Red Cup Cafe) the only place to get food 24 hours a day at The M Resort.

The menu features a wide array of different Burgers, sandwiches, salads and so on. Serving sizes are large and well presented and the prices are affordable.

Unfortunately this is very much \"fast food\" - the stuff looks MUCH better than it tastes and the eating area is rather small and soul-less like a food court.  If you are at M late at night and find yourself the victim of a snack attack - this will do just fine. Otherwise it's not something to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So many options and everything is amazing! Price point is decent considering at a resort, however, food quality makes it well worth it!

If staying at the M, you could eat here once a day and not get sick of it! Plenty of options. 

We live in Vegas in the southwest and will travel 20-25 min just to eat here sometimes...well worth the trip"}
{"text":"One of the best little delis at the M resort.    Their hamburgers/cheeseburgers are excellent.    Quality meat patties are used and broiled on the grill.   I'd skip the French fries and tater tots.  Not worth the money.     Also not the place to get pizza.     Their Asian salad is also wonderful and plentiful.    Moderately priced.      Use coupons or points for sure.   They will prepare to eat there or take up to room.           Cute , comfy seating"}
{"text":"Had a little time to kill before playing poker, so I thought I would grab a quick sandwich.
It was Sunday  about 11:00 so the deli was steady but definitely not busy. 

I opted to order the Hot Corned Beef for about $12. After about 15 minutes I beginning to think this is taking to long. I realize that they are also taking orders for the bar, but Damn! Well, it takes another 20 minutes for my order to come up. 

OK, order in hand I am ready for my big juicy sandwich, right?. Wrong. What I get is two thick slices of very dry Marbled Rye, 1/2 teaspoon of whole grain mustard, rubbery corned beef and soft (not melted) Swiss cheese.

What a drag."}
{"text":"Went for the $6.99 steak and eggs - waited as I saw numbers after me being called with my steak and eggs literally sitting around in front of me getting cold.

For 20 minutes my food sat there neglected - I don't know what to do - that was the worst part - the people whose numbers were after me got their food in a timely manner but I was hung out to dry.

When my number was finally called, it figures everything on my plate was lukewarm - I guess the people working there can't keep their orders straight when they are swamped.

UGH"}
{"text":"I have tried so many items on the menu and most are okay. I will recommend almost any sandwich and the rubens and clubs are respectable.  The menu does little to explain what is in any of them though so you best ask.

Don't bother with the nachos- 10$ for watered down cheese sauce, stale chips, chicken, jalapeños, tomatoes, olives.

They should offer more condiments but this place is OK after too many cocktails and you need to recharge."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I just got off work and joined my friends at the M to watch the NCAA games got a beer and was starving. Everyone around us had food and it looked and smelled great. I don't know if it was because i was hungry or what..
I could not find the server in the bar that took the food orders so i went straight up to the deli. My boyfriend wanted the meatball sub and I was going to get the chicken pita. I ordered the food and asked what was on both of the sandwiches since the menu didn't describe anything at all. 
The guy who took my order couldn't even tell me what was in the pita or what cheese came on the sub. I told him I was sitting in the bar watching the games and was wondering if there are any specials???? I got the duh uhhh face look and didnt even answer me. I was like never mind just the sub and pita, figured for 10$-11$ a sandwich it would come with idk chips or FF!!!!!  I got the food went back to the bar to eat.
1. I Have to say the meatball sub was really good. The meatball were full of flavor and a good size. BF enjoyed!!! But no side.
2. My pita had very little chicken and over whelmed with onion.!!. There was no sauce or anything just chicken,chesse and a pound of onions. 
WAS NOT IMPRESSED OR HAPPY SINCE I WAS STARVING.
later on i finally saw the server and she was like oh just to let you know if your still hungry we are doing a LG pizza and a Pitcher of beer for 17$ 
OH now you tell me the specials after i already had a bad experience and was over it now. 
I know I will be going back to the M to watch the game but thats most likley the last time im going to order from there."}
{"text":"I discovered this deli inside the M Resort & Casino while staying here.
Corned beef sandwich on marble was delish!
Had bacon, egg & cheese sandwich the next morning along with fresh fruit.
Again, a winner!
Refills on coffee & iced tea on same day purchase too!
To top it off, staff are all pleasant  :)
When I return to Vegas next year, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Vig Deli the other night.  It was a waste of money.  The food was terrible.  My order of matzo ball soup was inedible and tasted nothing like matzo ball soup.  The pastrami on my sister's sandwich was heated in a microwave prior to serving and some of the meat hardened on the bread.  Per my husband and my son, their Reuben and Cobb Salad were blah/unimpressive and they wouldn't order those items at this deli again.

I wouldn't recommend this deli under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I come here only when they send me $25 coupon once in a while.
There are always a lot of waiting in line to get free food (Me, too).
Can't complain about the food because I'm getting it for free but last time when I ordered Cobb salad, they only put 3 tiny pieces of chicken in it and forgot to put bacon. I saw the kitchen was crazy busy so I didn't want to complain. The salad was nice and crisp.
I'll be back when I get a free coupon again."}
{"text":"Talk about a sight for sore eyes. 2:45am, long flight with an even longer car rental experience, and in we walk. Succor! Succor! Vig offered me a Ham, Cheese, and Egg Sandwich, which felt like the best one I've ever tasted as I ate it. You should probably take points away since like I said, I was crazy hungry, but Vig definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. So greasy and I'm pretty sure the cheese is gov't processed. I've had better pizza from Little Caesers."}
{"text":"Gotta love the Vig Deli because it's a great alternative to The Studio B Buffet when the line and wait are so long at that establishment that anything starts sounding good.  Fortunately, Vig Deli is a pretty good place to satisfy an appetite.  Forget about Hash House A-Go-Go...the food there is pretentious and the flavors are lacking.  If Studio B is bustling then the best alternative has got to be Vig Deli unless you have a nice suit on and have an incredibly beautiful date with you, then I'd go to one of The M Resort's fancier eating establishments.

Just a note:  the chili is crazy good at the Vig Deli."}
{"text":"Even with a discount, the food here is just awful.  The only good thing about here is the workers are super nice and they clean up after you're done.  Ordered the following items dine in:
-BLT (super dry and poor choice of lettuce type)
-Philly Cheesesteak w/ Mushrooms (they do not use thin sliced steak, some other thick cut lean piece and the onions are not grilled enough and they use the string cuts, the cheese was on the bread, not on top - if you're going to have a cheesesteak on your menu at least do it right!)
-Slice of Pepperoni Pizza (super soggy - probably worse pizza I've ever had and this includes the horrible ones that are usually put out at buffets)
-Fries (nothing special and costs extra, does not come with either sandwich)
-Drink
The quality of the food here does not justify the prices that they charge, especially when everything is a la carte."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Ben there many times!

The staff is very professional and nice!

Located by the sports bar at M Casino Las Vegas it is a great place to have some awesome food and or sandwiches for which I have eaten there many times.

Their pizza is very tasty as you can taste each individual ingredient in every delicious bit.  You always leave full of food and calories!  Ok, Hit The Gym After! LOL

A great place to eat by yourself or even take a casual date!

You got to go, and be careful, don't spend all your money on the slots or at the tables. LOL 

Note:  There is no such thing as a HOT slot machine, only the seat you sit in.  

Have fun, its a must go!"}
{"text":"THE worst cheeseburger I have ever had. The meat was dry and resembled cardboard, the tomatoes had seen better days, and the onion was not fresh. All this awfulness for $12+. Never again."}
{"text":"Actual rating: 3.5

Service:  fair

Price: $$ 

Ordered: onion rings, mozzarella sticks, cheese pizza

Specialty: onion rings in my book

Quality of food: good

Revisit: yes

Parking: free parking and valet
     Finding space: easy

Cleanliness: clean

Overall: I love their onion rings.  It is crispy and semi sweet. It's just perfect.  Eat it when it is hot bc by the time you take it home it loses that crispness. The 

mozzarella sticks: called something else, which I forgot the name was too much of the cheese. If they just a little bit then it would be good. 
Cheese pizza: it was okay 


If you thought it was helpful, please hit those buttons [helpful, funny, cool or send me a compliment ]  Thank you and happy eating!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to Vig Deli. The first time I was there I wasn't hungry and was just sitting and chatting with friends, but after seeing the food that came out, I made the point that I will be back to taste the food out myself.

So this place is a high-end deli joint located in the M Casino.  (for those who don't know, M casino is a fairly new establishment in Henderson area where the first thing you see coming across the mountains from LA would be the M casino)

Checked out the menu and decided on the philly cheesesteak sandwich.  For $9.99, the portion was humongous!  Aside from the bread being super soft and delicious, they don't skimp on the toppings either!  Loaded with thinly sliced steaks smothered with I believe it's provolone cheese (it didn't taste like Mozzerella) and beautified with various red and green bell peppers with onions, this sandwich is a piece of art!

One bite into the sandwich I couldn't stop myself from digging further.  (despite my continued effort in cutting carbs down and out of my diet, I have to have this sandwich whole and quick!)  Overall the sandwich was tasty, soft, delicious, yet not salty at all!  Very proud of Vig Deli for creating this masterpiece...

My buddy got the triple decker with swirly bread!  The sandwich is actually bigger than those busses if there are any triple deckers out there.....OMG!  I'm so proud of him for finishing that up but I'm sure he was dying afterwards.... and he said it was absolutely wonderful!  The other two buddies got the pastrami sandwich and a bbq pull pork.... pastrami is pretty good and not salty and the pull pork is actually better than most of the bbq joints out there!  (Shame on your other \"real\" bbq joints out there for not being able to keep up with a deli joint!)  

Love me some onion rings as they looked so big and delicious, but needed to pass on this before I pass out!

One very small gripe though... I was looking forward to chicken livers as they had it on the menu last time I was here few months ago but they decided to take it out..... pretty sad as I was really looking forward to trying it.........

Definitely a place worth visit when you come to vegas.  Better yet, before those of you who drives from CA to NV and is heading back home, you might as well stop by the Vig Deli and pick up some of these artistic creations on your way back!  I guarantee that you will have a great ride home instead of trying to hit up In N Out or McDonalds for that matter!  Just make sure you stay awake after ingesting these awesome sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I was in Henderson closing a real estate deal, and my cuz from the area said lets drop by Vig Deli for lunch.  Its located in M Resort next to the Sports Book.

I ordered a chicken salad sandwich ($8.95) and large fries ($3.95).  My rellies ordered a Chinese chicken salad and Nathan's hot dog (the latter two not pictured).

First of all, my sandwich was very good.  It was packed full of tasty chicken salad, and it was reasonably priced.  It was way better vs the deli at South Point around the corner:  4 Stars.

Secondarily, the portion of fries were massive, and they were piping hot & crispy.  In addition, the fries were thick, making them easier to grip.  The three of us couldn't finish them:  4 Stars.

My rellies are regulars and enjoyed their meals.  They are locals and frequent the M earning points for free food.

Regarding the ambiance, its nothing to speak of.  There are simply some tables available to self seat yourself.  Nonetheless, the tables were clean:  3 Stars.

On the other hand, the service was excellent.  The cashier was super nice, the food came out quickly, and someone came by to bus our table.  The service was way better vs South Point that is slow AF:  5 Stars.

When I am in the Henderson area again, and I need a quick casual meal, I'd definitely return to Vigs.  The portions are hearty, and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm rating this place a little higher than it deserves but that has to be in part because I have never once paid to eat here. They send me free coupons, I go to eat. The food is fine, nothing too special. I usually get a steak and cheese and chicken noodle soup. Both are very generous portions, especially the soup. It's a slight cut above your average casino snack bar food. Adjacent to the sports book so you can watch the game while you eat.  I've always had very friendly service and I love that the self-serve soda machine has Coke Zero."}
{"text":"The food at the Vig is very delicious. Kind of pricey but worth the money because they give you big portions. We ordered the cheeseburger , 1/4 pound hot dog and the lox and bagel . The cheeseburger was very juicy and cooked to the way you like it. I ordered mine medium rare and that's exactly the way they cooked it. I wished it came with fries but it didn't . Extra fries costed another $3. The burger costed $12. The hot dog was very delicious and big. My daughter had the lox and bagel. She said the smoked salmon was very fresh and tasty . The service was very good and pretty fast too. Overall I loved this place and will definitely be back and also would recommend this place . :)"}
{"text":"Basic deli near the sportsbook at the M Resort Casino. Easy, basic prices, descent portions. Quick bites."}
{"text":"I was surprised at the quality of food.  I went here with my parents and we ordered the Rueben Sandwich, a Cesaer Salad, and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  ALL were delicious.  Next time I want to try the spaghetti and meatballs....that looked good also."}
{"text":"The only place in the M Resort on Father's Day that had a reasonable wait time.

Grilled Chicken Caesar Wrap was one of the specials of the day.  For $10 you'd think it would be a little more fancy than a normal salad in a wrap.  Or at least come with a side.  That being said, I love normal Caesar salad so it was very tasty to me.  Also ordered a side of fries that was ginormous, so that deal balanced the whole thing out."}
{"text":"Vig Deli is amazing! I have never had a bad experience with their food and I've been here quite a few times! Their customer service is outstanding. Everyone is friendly and pleasant. 

I recommend the cheeseburger, chicken fingers, extra fries, and their tater tots! 

You can also watch sports while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"A solid 2.75 stars if that makes sense. I've eaten here a few times and I hate to give them a 2 star review because their food is good, most of the time. I don't know what it is, but it's a gamble coming here because of the consistency. 

The first time we came here, all the food was fresh and hot. My reuben sandwich was packed with meat and my fries were crispy. My BF ordered a Chicago dog and it was juicy. 

Another time we ordered a burger and onion rings. The burger was well done , like WELL DONE, when I ordered it medium well. The tomatoes and onions were old and stale. And the onions rings tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while. It wasn't even worth a picture it was so bad. 

This last time we ordered chicken wings. Good sized wings, but could have used more sauce. Their celery sticks and ranch were good. 

All kitchen staff need to be retrained so consistency can be met. But to the person who is in the kitchen during our good visits, props to you sir! They have decent bar food and it's close to home, so I'll be back, hopefully on one of their better days."}
{"text":"I love Vig Deli!!!! I come here with my boyfriend maybe 2-3 times a week because it's convenient and delicious. The tuna melt is always on point and the cooks are consistent. The reason I'm giving three stars is due to the quality of customer service presented by Betty. It's not her fault, but perhaps she needs to be trained properly in hospitality and the importance of making each guest feel valuable. It's sad that she wasn't given the proper tools to perform her job, but I'm hoping that this review could be used as an example and/or incentive to learn the core values of this establishment."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch while at a conference at The M Resort.  The line was LONG, really long and service was too slow.  Once we were able to place our order, we then waited about 15 minutes for our food.  Many others were called ahead of us, which prompted us to complain a couple of times to the staff and they prepared our food.

Once we got our food it was prepared really nice and it was very tasty.  The Reuben was amazing!  They also don't have any healthy options, aside from the typical list of salads."}
{"text":"One of the best Delis for the price in town. Good food. Great portions. Club sandwich is worth trying and don't forget about the breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.. it's overall cheaper than Studio B buffet so if you're not looking to engorge yourself, this is a safe bet. With that said, I have a few complaints. 

The Bad

1. The prices are a little on the high side but then again all the places in the hotel were expensive, even Baby Cakes but still for what I got in terms of what I paid for.. wasn't worth it.  For instance, their turkey sandwich was around 10 dollars and the turkey tasted like it was from one of those prepackaged supermarket aisles and to top it off.. they had no dressing for it. Seriously? Turkey is a dry meat and when you put it on sourdough with lettuce and tomato but no dressing.. its like biting into a sofa cushion. 

2. Their chicken noodle soup was atrocious. I love clear broth when it comes to my soups so I was expecting their chicken noodle to be clear and that's why I chose it over their Clam Chowder and Chili. I will say though that the chicken itself was plentiful and plump and the portion was big but I'd rather have good soup with a little amount than bad soup at a larger amount. 

The Good

1. They're open pretty much 21 hours a day so if you're hungry late at night or something, you're good. The hours I believe were 10am to 7am? Which is pretty much the whole day.

2. Their chicken fingers were the bomb but again kind of expensive because even though it was 11 dollars, it didn't come with any fries but it was still pretty good. 

3. Their sodas were 2.99 BUT it was free refills so it pretty much kind of works itself out.

Overall, the price was the biggest factor but it still deserved a 4 star review."}
{"text":"Before heading back to the strip from an all night gambling streak here at The M, we stopped to grab a snack at  Vig Deli.  I wanted something small and simple, so I opted for a 1/4pd hot dog.  Have I forgotten how big a 1/4 pd really is? If I was supposed to order by the numbers, well I already screwed up by saying \"1 hot dog, please.\"  At any rate, it was tasty and at least know that the hot dog is safe there.  My friend had a basket of fries and I even split the hot dog with her.  I think chili would have been perfect with those fries and the hot dog as well.  I think we tend to get delirious about snacking when you've been gambling all night and hit a deli at 3am.
Where have the soda machines gone?"}
{"text":"We had  pound hot dogs that were pretty good, but I would avoid the  the prepared food in the deli case which looked pretty nasty."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about the Vig. They have a fantastic lineup of sandwiches.  Although they are pricey for a deli joint, they make up for it in humongous portions!  They're open late, there are plenty of seating with a couple of TV screens and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I knew what I was potentially getting into before I came here. But I was craving some breakfast before I went to work, it was 5 am, and no other spot was open that early and serving pancakes. In the end, I paid for a bunch of poorly prepared food.

I got two specials, the NY strip and the pancakes. I asked for a  medium cooked steak and I got it well-done and super charred. I asked for scrambled soft eggs, and I got eggs that could be eaten like a salad, they were so hard. The advertised home fries were just frozen and out of a bag steak fries. The sourdough toast I asked for was toasted to desert levels of dryness.

The pancakes I got were just super dense doughy disks. They didn't have any real taste, and especially not like the buttermilk I was hoping for. The butter and syrup I drowned on them couldn't save them.

Wasted money, a wasted breakfast craving, didn't get good pancakes, and I left knowing to never eat here again."}
{"text":"We needed something to eat before a show.
The options were to eat at The M or drive back to eastern.
Decided to give the deli a shot.
Depressing tots, fries and onion rings, they were warm, not crisp at all.
Had a corned beef, it was pretty decent, no where near NYC standards though. The best part was the Beaver Deli mustard, it was awesome.
Wife enjoyed her fish tacos.
Seating is limited and self serve on the drink machine."}
{"text":"We were actually going to try the buffet since it was voted the #1 buffet in Vegas, but the line was too long and we were hungry.  Well look over there!  A deli with a very little line.   DONE!

Overall, an excellent deli.  Portions were good size, meat and bread were good, veggies were fresh, and you could tell they were working hard behind the counter.  As most Vegas casino food, it's a little pricey, but I prefer this deli compared to Subway.  

Next time we're at the M Resort, we might just skip the buffet again and go here."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick non-Las Vegas strip lunch and was surprised as to how much I liked everything! 

There are not descriptions on the menu, but the friendly cashier will gladly explain what each menu item is. 

We ordered the hummus, club sandwich and Asian chicken sandwich. The club sandwich flavorful and had a lot of meat. The hummus was just okay; carrots were slimy. My Asian chicken salad had a hair in it but the way Vig Deli recovered was excellent. They offered me a complimentary chocolate bundt cake (yum!), had my new salad out in a couple of minutes AND checked on me to make sure everything was okay. Salad is mostly cabbage mixed with cilantro and a little arugula (I believe). Nuts and croutons to give it a crunch and juicy chicken...I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Ruben was very good but basically it's fast food in a casino so it's kind of overpriced plus you have to deal with the fact that you are in the casino"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed  my food is so bad or should I say nasty  fries are saggy  fish is cold even how hungry I am I just loss my appetite 
Service 4 Stars 
Ambiance 3 Stars 
Food 1 Star 
I even ask the cashier and she was bragging how good it is  I won't even feed my dog  wit the food waste of money"}
{"text":"We never leave a late night at M without aquick bite from Vig Deli.  It might be a tad pricier than your average deli, but their portions are huge (easy to share 1 sandwich between two people)!  

Vig's is your typical deli with sandwiches, wraps, burgers, hot dogs, soups.  My favs are the Philly Cheese and pastrami sandwiches.  Love the chicken noodle soup there...love!  Their hot dogs (Nathan's) are on point too.  One time I got the French Dip (favorite sandwich of all time), and I have to admit that it wasn't the best and kind of bland.  I ended up sticking an onion ring in the sandwich to make it good.  Other than that though, food has been pretty great!

Do share the side orders of fries and onion rings - the portions are pretty big.

Pretty much a serve your self type of place.  Nothing too fancy - but a really nice late night eat spot in my opinion!

After playing at the tables for a while, don't forget to ask the pit boss for some comps.. they are super generous at M!"}
{"text":"If you have no patience and would like to avoid the lines and crowd at the M, then this is the place to grub!

Vig deli is located who knows where in some corner at the M.

I love this place because it is quick and easy, but yet their food is very delish, and does not have the same quality as a fast food.

They have many varieties from salads to lox bagels, to fish and chips to burgers.

Whenever I am not in the mood to to line up i usually come here.

This place is usually empty, great service, and the food is prepared upon order."}
{"text":"This place is your saving grace from the outrageous Buffet prices! It isn't cheap but it isn't over the top expensive either. It has soup and pizza and fried stuff, you know the usual deli type fare.
 The seating is ok, typical small tables with small hard chairs. Service is fairly quick, sometimes there is a line. They have a lot of condiments you can put on yourself etc. It's conveniently located on one corner, technically you can probably call something in or get something quick at that entrance if preferred.
 Nothing bad to say here, it's clean. Might not be the best in town ( Which I have yet to find deli wise) but its a great alternative to the pricey sit down joints in this location. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I will come back definitely to try other food in the menu if i'll be around the area. Met up a few friends but no time to wait in a restaurant or buffet and it was the best option.
The tuna was really good and the burger was juicy. i tried the beef chili and did not expect to have a big bowl:-)"}
{"text":"One of the coolest bars in town.  They offer about 100 beers on tap and they are adjacent to the sports book at the M Resort for those of us whom like to gamble.  

The bartenders are super friendly here and always take care of us.  It's nice to go to a bar and after a couple visitors they know what you want to drink and they know your names. 

They also have a good menus with burgers, hotdogs and salads too."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian sausage and peppers and when it came out it looked fantastic until I had to eat it. The sausage itself was extremely dry and it was doused in tomato sauce which made the inside of the roll/bun soggy. Definitely not great. Is have to try some other items on the menu to really get s feel for this place but after that complete fail I still will give it another chance."}
{"text":"We had a group of six on a Sunday and there were maybe twenty people total in the bar. We came to bet on sports, then hang out to drink and eat while we watched sports. The waitress would rarely stop by to check up on us. The servers were snippy and rude. 

Once we asked for the check it took twenty minutes to receive it. Our group of six paid half cash and split the rest on cards. When we got the receipts back, they completely forgot to subtract the cash from the total and charged the full amount to three cards. When we brought up the mistake it took them 45+ minutes to correct the mistake. There are four people standing at a cash register trying to void transactions and do some some basic subtraction.

When we finally got the checks the staff was very apathetic. They apologized \"for the wait\" but not for messing up our checks."}
{"text":"...so why review this....hmmmm...its right down the street from where I live and when I or one of my friends has a cold or the flu I come here for the fresh Chicken Noodle soup which they sell at a great price...and...their other food is decent if you want to munch on something while you figure out what to bet on as the sports book is right there as well...did I mention the Chicken Noodle soup....yummmmm"}
{"text":"Located next to Sports Book inside the M. They have breakfast and lunch items like eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, sandwiches, melts, fries, onion rings, fish n chips, lo and bagels, etc. You place your order, they give you a ticket, they'll call your ticket number when your food is ready.

Tuna Melt:
Very buttery bread. The tuna was ok. 3/5

Turkey Melt:
Very greasy and salty. I could feel my lips puffing up an my arteries clogging. I can imagine this being very good if you're drunk. 3/5

I love the fact that they have lots of TV's on sports channels."}
{"text":"We came here for the $6.99 late night streak n' eggs after a long flight because our go-to spot is usually packed on Saturday nights! The deli is located next to the sports book inside of the M Casino. 

This is a deli-styled restaurant so you order your food at the cashier and grab your own drinks, seat yourself, ect. My boyfriend ordered the steggs and I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. Everything was huge. The grilled cheese sandwich came with a choice of bread and cheese alongside a basket of fries and a pickle. The steak and eggs came with toast and potatoes. Everything was super filling and generally the wait time was pretty fast regardless of how busy it was (after midnight on a Saturday night). I've also ordered take out from here before and despite the fact that it was chicken wings, something that often gets soggy, it was super filling and still crispy and fresh. The prices are reasonable and their menu is around the general ballpark of $10 for a majority of the food items. I think the best part is that you can take everything to-go so you have the option of eating in the comfort of your own home."}
{"text":"When I first tasted this place it was pretty awful; however, after coming back again this place has gotten better! The variety of choice that they have is great and the size of the food is worth the price. 

I usually order the spaghetti & meatballs.  Thought its not something out of a five-star italian restaurant it is certainly better than the one a any Olive Garden restaurant. 

Past orders (out of 5 stars) 
Casear Salad: 3.8
Fish & Chips: 4.2
Patty Melt: 4.0
Fries: 4.5
Cheese Steak:3.8 (I think I prefer Capriottis Cheese steak over Vig deli)
Tuna Sandwich: 3.0
Chicago Hot Dog: 3.0

Service:  The cashier I usually encounter are always very pleasant and they usually have a great attitude."}
{"text":"I feel you can't go wrong here.  Everything here looks greet.  Been here a few times and so far everything I've had was good.  No disappoint so far.  It can get busy and you might have to stand in line depending on the time."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to come here at least twice a week because of the great coupons that the M Resort would send out each month. They still send out coupons but now instead of buy one and get one free, it $5.00 off your purchase. It's still a good deal, though, since most of their items like their sandwiches are between $9.99 and $11.99.

It is located inside the M Resort and we decided to eat here after doing a little bit of gambling. I wasn't having much luck at the poker machines and figured I would do better on a full stomach. We both ordered the footlong Nathan hot dog, Chicago style, which was $4.99 each. I always scrape off the onions but eat everything else. We've ordered the hot dog before and sometimes the bun falls apart but it didn't happen on this occasion which was a plus!

This place also has desserts and I believe the desserts are from Baby Cakes... we almost got a cookie but I'm trying to be good... I had a lot of sweets earlier in the day.

By the way, the wait for the food is never long. You order and pay the cashier and wait for your number to be called. I think the longest I ever had to wait was 15 minutes but that was on a very busy afternoon and we ordered a whole pizza.

The cashiers here are always so friendly and it is always the same three ladies that I see every time I come in."}
{"text":"We came here when my friends got the drunchies. For a deli inside a casino, it's really not that bad.

My friend ordered the reuben, which was honestly really good. The salty pastrami on a toasted bread, topped with sauerkraut that was actually sour, and not sweet. It was a bit too greasy for me, and I kind of felt the grease sitting in my stomach afterwards, BUT for the moment that I bit into it and ate the bite of sandwich, it was really good.

My boyfriend ordered the pastrami sandwich, which was okay. The bread wasn't toasted, so that already downgrades the sandwich. Withy a bit of mustard though, it's quite good. The pickle on the side was sour and delicious, giving it a refreshing kick.

We also ordered the fries topped with Texas beef chili and cheese. The chili wasn't terrible, but it definitely wasn't the best. It was more of a soup-y chili consistency, and therefore was more liquidy than appropriate with the french fries. The fries themselves weren't too bad, but unfortunately it soaked up the liquidy chili and got soggy. Another downside of the chili was that it was served on a basket covered with paper. Result: forks stab the bottom of the basket, creating holes, and therefore causing the chili to seep out the bottom. Poorly thought out, that's for sure.

Great drunk food, but probably not so great food for when you're sober."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas I always hit up one of the cheap steaks around town that sell for less than $10.  I recently found out about Big Deli at the M.  They have a steak and eggs special that runs for $6.99 on Friday and Saturday nights starting at 11 pm.  If you've gone to South Point, you're familiar with their setup.  It's much different here. 

It's not a waiter service restaurant.  You walk up to a register, order your food, then they call you when it's finished.  It comes with the 7 oz steak, two eggs of your choosing, small potato wedges, and two pieces of toast.  The meal itself is amazing.  Like I said, I always come and get it whenever I'm in Vegas.  There's a lot less people here than their counterparts so that's always a plus when I want to just eat in peace and head home afterwards."}
{"text":"We eat here all the time when we stop in at the M to have a few drinks and we have never been disappointed. The steak nachos, fish and chips and the Rueben with pastrami are some of our favorites! Decent prices and the food comes out quick!"}
{"text":"Went here again yesterday, as the M Buffet was too crowded only an hour before closing time, and I was dumb and forgot my coupons at home.  

I had yet another chicken caesar and it was much much better prepared.  My husband had the foot long hot dog and it was one of the best non-kosher hot dogs I have ever eaten.  I believe they use nathan's.  However, they grilled it and it had an incredible char that gave it good flavor."}
{"text":"Mom and I had lunch here recently. The line was super long but it went pretty fast.  And then the food came pretty quick too even with the crowd.  Their short order cooks definitely have it worked out.  Mom had the Shrimp Basket which was fried shrimp and fries.  The fries are always good there.  Crispy on the outside, soft inside.  You do need to add salt to them though.  I had the Asian Chicken Salad.  It had lots of good toppings and Asian sesame dressing.  And the salads are always good size and filling.  So another good meal even with the crowd."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty tasty, but the last few times I have ordered wings and fries, they were quite crappy due to the oil being very old. Please change out your oil when it gets nasty, it makes tasty junk food, just taste like junk."}
{"text":"Less than half what you'd pay on the Strip, and the food is actually very good. Plus, you can sit at the 32 Degrees bar and order from the deli. The triple decker with turkey, pastrami, and corned beef was especially awesome."}
{"text":"This deli/restaurant is open 24/7 just walk in
Any time of the day and you'll be served the
Food of your choice.

I like the serving portions of the food it is 
Large and you get what you pay for.I had 
Eggs with sausage and my wife had bagel
With cream cheese 

The food was tasting fresh and came with 
Side dishes too :)

Most yelpers post pics of the food I wanted 
To post actual pics of the restaurant to give
Viewers an idea of the place.

Service was also quick and the chef was Nice."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good deli sandwiches - had the Reuben - lots and lots of meat between 2 pieces of soft rye bread - condiments on the table like hot mustard - slap it on the sandwich and wolf it down!!  Really, really good Reuben!

Also, had a taste of their Chicken Noodle Soup - a big heaping bowl plate of their Chicken Noodle soup - loads of chicken pieces and noodles in a nice clear chicken broth - good for days when you don't feel like eating a whole lot.  

How to order - order at the cashier, pay for it and then wait for your no. to be called to pick up your food - just like in the New York Delis.  

Noisy atmosphere in the corner of M Resort."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  I actually thought the clam chowder would be average and the fish tacos amazing.  The chowder was very tasty but the fish tacos were horrid.  At first I thought just \"not great\" but as I ate more the fish was excessively greasy and the balance of fish was way over bearing to a good fish taco.   So disappointed.  No other choice midday other then buffet."}
{"text":"The Vig Deli has incredible sandwiches.  We are especially addicted to the Philly Cheesesteak.  It is always loaded with mushrooms, onions, peppers and cheese.  The bun is perfectly toasted.  The Reuben is good as well, with lean beef.  Fries are hot, and have a good potato flavor."}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????24?????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"well I'm glad I give another try this time was perfect my med rare burger once againg even better than the burgers n brews all employee nice and frendly ."}
{"text":"My BFF and family had visited our fab city of Las Vegas and we just had to sneak in one last visit and lunch. The M Resort is always our perfect choice as it gives fantastic access to the 15 and quick for us to get to from home.  We had not tried The Vig Deli yet, and we both have children under 7 and thought the ease and comfort of a casual setting was the perfect choice for us.
The employees were nice and helpful beyond the call of duty.  We had ordered quite a few different things so we could all share but I was worried about carrying it all to the table. Michael, the cashier assured me he would help. After about 10 minutes our food was ready and myself and BFF started to carry it to the table when he ran over and said \"Let me help!\" without us even asking! He took the trays out of our hands and brought them to the hubs and kids.
The food was fresh and delicious! We had a chicken caesar salad, cheeseburger and FF, soup, and sandwich and more. Of course, I LOVE the refillable soda machine as I am a lover of Diet Coke. 
We even had a \"party foul\" when my son spilled some of his soup. The attendant ran over and helped and was so sweet about it and wouldn't accept a small tip we offered! Really?! 
Once again, The M has done a fabulous job of choosing employees and offering delicious and comfortable dining!"}
{"text":"When staying at the M for a Vegas \"staycaytion\" slept a little too late for regular breakfast so checked this spot out.  Tends to be a regular place for the locals and of course the hotel workers.  Affordable.  Short order cook was super friendly.  I got the steak and eggs and my steak was, man, really hard to chew and cut.  Scrambled eggs were perfect.  And yes, you can mess up scrambled eggs.  They had several coffee options which was nice but this ain't no Starbucks.  Serving was plentiful.  Tables are quite close to the Casino floor which can make for a smoky breakfast.  Not my thing."}
{"text":"This deli is adjacent to the sport book/sports bar area in the M Hotel and Casino. 

We stopped in for a quick bite after playing the tables for a little bit on our way out. It's a nice option for a meal. The deli meat was fresh. There was a nice option of different meats for sandwiches. There were several sides to choose from, but we skipped sides and opted for a salad. The sandwiches are made to order. The tomato and lettuce was crisp and fresh. The accompanying pickle was crunchy and yummy too. 

We also got a Cobb salad. All the items were fresh. It was a generous portion of ingredients. The dressing was good, but they had only a small selection of dressings.

In all, it's a decent place to eat. Nothing gourmet. Prices were on the high side. There were other food options if you wanted hot dogs, fish and chips or other dishes."}
{"text":"I've had very mixed experiences here over the years, and that hasn't changed with my latest update! The Patty Melt is usually a good quality choice, but this time it was a little subpar. The burger I ordered medium rare was overcooked. The deli is usually quite busy, so they must be doing something right. Unfortunately, it's usually not what I'm ordering! I've had the fried shrimp meal a few times, and this is consistently very good. 

The menu has great variety, from sandwiches to hot dogs, pizza, salads, etc. They also usually have a daily special which can include paninis, soup & salad, or seafood meals on Fridays. If you're a players' club member, you may receive coupons for the Deli in your mailer. These are a pretty good deal and I've used them quite a few times. The Deli's locale near the sports book & 32 Degree Draft Bar is relevant to the Deli's name."}
{"text":"ill make this quick. my party and i didnt arrive at the m for our stay until 1am so this place i believe was the only place open in the hotel.

typical deli fare, sandwiches, salad and soups. i ordered a chicken ceasar salad which i thought was delish but my aunt ordered the tuna melt and didnt like it.  

the man behind the counter was very friendly and helpful and for me hey it beat room service. a chicken caesar salad at the M room service was 16.95, here it was only 8.95 so that worked for me"}
{"text":"Really, don't listen to all these complainers with the 1-star reviews. 

Came to The M last night to get some drinks and hang out. Went to the Lobby Bar (will have to review that seperately) for a few drinks and afterwards me and the girlfriend were pretty hungry. We just wanted something quick and easy. Saw the word \"Deli\" and thought thats exactly the kind of \"quick and easy\" we were looking for...

We ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich along with an order of chili cheese fries all to share. First off, the portions are HUGE, 3 people could have easily shared. The BBQ pulled pork sandwich was boommb. I dont know if it was the alcohol beforehand or what, but it hit the spot and then some! The chili cheese fries were not too bad either! 

BBQ pulled pork - $5.99
Side of fries - $2.99 (add $1 for chili AND cheese!)


Amazing deal for some pretty damn good food! Will definitely be back to both the Lobby Bar and Vig Deli!"}
{"text":"It's past midnight, we're not drunk but we're hungry. We cash in at the cage and proceed to Vig Deli. 
My friends place an order (separate tab) and go sit down and wait. I place an order and I give her a $100 (a bill I received at the cage) and she holds it up to the light and goes back and forth with her co workers and then comes back and tells me it's counterfeit. Ok... I explain to her I got it from the cage and she says she can't accept it or take my order without another form of payment. She's allowed to think what she wants but really... I ask to speak to the manager and he takes his sweet time because my friends food have already come but they refuse to eat it unless I get my order. Food goes cold and he finally trudges in. At this point, he says he can accept the $100 but we'll take our business elsewhere. My friends ask for a refund and he takes his sweet time doing that. No thanks!
Vig: Have more than one manager at night and train and train your cashiers to have a bit of competency and not take life so seriously."}
{"text":"How do I live so close to the M and not come here more often?!

A girlfriend and I stopped since we needed dinner and a study break.  The place is literally on the casino floor with no barriers between you and the slot machines.  The sports bar is also nearby so you can hear lots of cheering (or booing, depending on the game and people) if there's an exciting game on.

My girlfriend ordered the chicken tenders and fries.  I got the beef brisket sandwich ($8.99?), fountain drink (makes me wish the M still offered free soda), and fruit tart ($4.99, say what?!).  My bill was $16 and some change.

Note, napkins are only available at the counter where you pick up your food, although plastic ware and stuff is located near the self-serve stuff.

Our food came out pretty quickly, just enough time for the two of us to devour the delicious and beautiful fruit tart.  My sandwich was huge, I could only eat 1/2 of it.  The beef was moist and tender and covered in just enough BBQ sauce.  This wouldn't be a good togo or take home dish though because the moisture from the meat and sauce soak the bun.  It was good, not great, but good.
The fries were hot and good.  I liked that they weren't overly salty so you can still salt them to taste.  
My girlfriend's chicken tenders were ahhhmazing.  We couldn't finish all 5 of those huge suckers.  They were so moist and had a perfect amount of breading on them.  

Next time my girlfriend and I go back, I think we'll just get one order of fries and tenders to split between the two of us!  And I won't order a fountain drink.  Just not worth the extra couple bucks.  But I'll definitely be back."}
