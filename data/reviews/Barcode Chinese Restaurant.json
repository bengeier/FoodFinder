{"text":"Found this place on Yorkbbs because they sell spicy crabs but we were really disappointed, because they used blue crabs and the dish looks nothing like pictured, and the crabs smell so bad (definitely not fresh)  We also tried their bbq dishes, super long wait time, and they do not have much taste, can only taste the spices. Their spicy shredded potato dish is super sweet, very not authentic.  Their bbq lamb was the only ok food for the night, although a little burnt. Soup was ok nothing special.   Overall, super disappointed, will not return again."}
{"text":"Barcode is one of my favorite joint in Scarbrough for food.  In this restaurant you get to taste real authentic Chinese food. The BBQ lamb skewer from here is the best I had in 15 years of dinning in Toronto. Is tender and juicy. Most time BBQ skewers are very dry, not this place.  The staff here are friendly and the service is good. They open very late, till 3am I believe.  Yes, the location is very obscure, it looks very shady from the outside, but never judge a book by its cover.  This place has hands down the best late night food in Scarbrough. I come to this place a few times every month."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this is 3 price stars? The food here is super cheap in my opinion, and super good for the price. Wide range of Chinese cuisine, the portions are pretty generous as well. There's also karaoke rooms for people that like that.  The service there was also super friendly! It was my birthday and they gave us crabs and noodles on the house ( not that it made me biased or anything :P)   Recommend if you want cheap/good Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"As has been stated in several previous reviews, from the outside the place does look a little sketchy.  It's on an industrial area and the building itself looks old.  The food however was amazing.  My wife and I came here for lunch and had the curry chicken, braised pork and lamb skewers.  Our meal came with fried rice as well.  I'm not generally a big rice eater, but this rice had great flavour.  The lamb was a little spicy but tasted great.  The curry wasn't spicy at all...it was more sweet.  My favourite was the braised pork, which for me had great flavour.  The decor is a little \"funny\" but the service was fantastic.  They just started opening for lunch this week and have some great lunchtime specials.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place...and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This ain't no Tassimo's Barcode. It doesn't follow proper instructions. I thought the outside was ghetto. Inside was even more suspicious. It's amazing that the Food is edible. The Food is Meh to A-OK at best. I suggest you be Risk-Averse. Coming from a Risk-Food Seeker."}
{"text":"We order some of their signature dish including lamb skewers, crayfish. The food was delicious and quick. It reminds me of my childhood food that I ate in Beijing. It made me quite nostalgic."}
{"text":"The place looks extremely sketchy and hidden where if you don't know the location of this restaurant, you wouldn't be able to find it. It's located in a factory area inside smaller streets. The restaurant just has a small lighted sign in red saying \"BARCODE\". The parking lot seems like a back of a restaurant or a empty piece of land where you just park. There's a dumpster at the side of the parking lot which makes it smell pretty bad at times.  Once you walk inside, it seems totally different. The decoration is very nice with each booth sectioned off, so you get more privacy. Once you walk in, the smell of the restaurant, the decoration and vibe it gives off makes you feel like you're in China. (If you've ever been to China places, this is exactly how it feels.) In every booth, it has their own TV, streaming some China drama show which is quite entertaining if you understood.  The Menu is quite simple with lots of pictures, I would say EVERY dish they serve has a picture to show what it is, as well as English translation. They provide you with a pencil and a piece of paper and you write down the item number of the dish you would like to order.   Alcohol are fairly cheap here, $2.99 for a bottle of domestic, $3.99 for imported. I would say if you can't eat spicy food, this ISN'T a place for you! 90% of their items of the menu are spicy because that's just the style of the restaurant and I would say it's very spicy ( I eat sriracha on a regular basis). Their food is made so spicy because 99% customers come to drink and when you're drinking, the alcohol calms the spiciness down as well as your taste buds aren't as sensitive. The price of the food is considered pricy for this type of Asian cuisine.  This place opens late so it's great to grab drinks and food at night.   Servers don't speak very fluent English, but good enough to communicate.  Overall, I would only come back if I'm in the area looking for spicy food to eat or if it's late at night and I desperately need food."}
{"text":"I can't give this place 5 stars because it just feels so wrong. This place is the very definition of an aesthetic apocalypse, ghetto Chinese interior design at it's finest. This is the rare kind of place where the interior somehow is able to dethrone the exterior in crappiness. Where your OMG reaction outside is only superseded by WTF once you're inside. I won't go into specifics because there are just no words to describe it; you have to see it for youself!  This is as traditional as it gets when it comes to Chinese cooking. There style is unapologetic, unforgiving and uncivilized; greasy, oily, spicy and salty. Yes, this stuff is the perfect accompaniment to the many many ice cold beers and booze you will be devouring all night.  The menu is vast and varied. You will find everything under the eastern sun but it's best you be not picky and you shouldn't be. Everything ranges from weird to oddly delicious and \"OMG, WTF this stuff taste ridiculously good but what is it??\"  The entertainment (yes, there is!) is also varied. There is karaoke, dice games and yes... you can smoke inside.  This is one of those places where you leave all your inhibitions behind. Don't bring your significant other, your date or your parents. Don't bring anyone you are looking to impress. Go ahead and be loud, be obnoxious. Just make sure you do it within your own confines. This place is frequent by a lot of obnoxious spoiled Chinese 'fuerdai' - 'second rich' kids. Don't be surprised to pull up to parking lot full of cars that cost more than your house."}
{"text":"I love the BBQ here and I had best service here. Waitress are pretty and nice to costumer. I like their smile! It just like Chinese \"night restaurant\". I think the reason why the restaurant got 1 star is becoz not that much \"Chinese food fan\" here~"}
{"text":"The place seems really ghetto but surprisingly the food is better than the looks. You would find good skewers here, but definitely not the best. Opens to really late, so if you want a good midnight snack this may be a good place to go for skewers and beer. The menu is very detailed with good pictures, but the service so not that great. Although you get what you ask for, just don't expect too much for the waiters there."}
{"text":"I would never have go into Barcode Chinese Restaurant if I am alone!!! No way... even I am really desperate for a FTR, but I do have my standard...   While driving to the restaurant... I passed by undeveloped commercial factory area... sketchy... and then my GPS led me to this garage look alike address...... maybe this place used to be a garage??   We were greeted by 2 good looking Chinese girls... I guess because of that he didn't ask to leave...and we were seated at a booth of this completely empty restaurant... BTW, not even any other customers came the whole time we were there...... private dining experience!   The best thing Barcode has is the WIFI.... and sweet looking waitresses. The restaurant feels like someone's basement... there is a pool table, some messy here and there... and cheap recycled furnitures.   Menu is nicely done with tons of photos, so it is easy to order... and they spell there OWN name wrong on the cover of their menu...   - Spicy Crab ($8.99) and Spicy Winkles ($9.99) both tasted A-OK and plentiful. We can barely finished them.   - BBQ Back Ribs ($8.99) was really disappointing, dried and bland...   - BBQ Lamb Skewers ($4.99) came in 5 skewers.. nicely marinated with cumin, chili powder, a little dry..but taste ok if you ate them when they were hot   - Tanghulu ($3.00) (candied Chinese hawthorn) was totally disappointing!! It was like frozen hard..and you might harm yourself or chip a teeth if you tried eating that!   I been to more shady and dirty joint before and Barcode is not the worse... However, it really ticked me off were those waitresses was skewering raw chicken/beef on bamboo sticks right next to our table and serving us the same time.......There must be some health code against that?? Do it at the back!! At least I don't know......   My friend got his good looking waitresses..but I got nothing... at least I don't have tummy ache after the dinner... ... I don't think I will be back!!"}
