{"text":"We pass this restaurant at least four times a day in our travels, and finally decided to try it tonight.  I wish we had just gone to Applebee's.  My husband got wings and they were itty bitty.  Very overpriced for the quality of the meat.  I got a burger, just plain with cheese.  Like another reviewer said, it is a uniform, frozen patty that you can get in Wal-Mart.  No seasonings whatsoever and tasted like the char of the grill.   It was bad and very greasy.  I ordered it medium well and it was quite pink inside.  I can see this being ok if you are making fresh burgers and know where the meat is from (and know for sure that it's fresh!), but I would never cook a generic frozen patty to a medium temperature.  It wasn't a good quality patty, either.  It was your basic, cheap frozen picnic hamburger.   Not a safe call on their part, in my opinion.  I ate around the edges and left the center where it was medium-rare.   The fries were also frozen, not freshly cut.  Really disappointing, especially since our family eats out a lot.   We'd be happy to go there more often if our experience had been enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have gone to Blue Water Tavern almost weekly since it has opened. I have been there for both business and with my family.  Blue Water is an independently owned restaurant and not part of a chain.

The people at the restaurant are what make it special particularly the bartenders.  Caleb, Shannon and Christy all are great at customer service.  I enjoy eating lunch or dinner at the bar because they are easy to talk to.

The food at Blue Water is pretty extensive and I like most of the dishes.  If you're going I have three recommendations.

1.  The burgers are awsome.  The owner told me last week they have already sold over 15,000 burgers since opening.  I know why.  They are always grilled correctly and come on a bun that doesn't take away from the meat.  I like the Bayou Blue and the Smokehouse burger (with BBQ) the best.  Great fries, and Iike to ask for them crispy.

2. Seafood.  In the North Hills it is tough to find good seafood.  They have that covered at Blue Water Tavern.  There is a fish special grilled every day, I like the Crab ala Vodka and the Lobster and Shrimp macaroni and cheese.  Their crab cakes are also very good. I think they have over 15 seafood choices on the menu.

3. Tapas.  I love eating this way and there are some other great restaurants on the southside, Tusca and Mallorca, that have these dishes.  Blue Water allows to you try three of them with something called their tavern trio.  I like the ceviche, seseame crusted tuna and their wings but you have almost 20 things to chose from.

I have read many of the other reviews online and I agree that Blue Water has had issues with service and consistency, but since I have been here probably more than most customers I can tell you that it great place to hang out and they getting better at what they do.  Hey they have only been open since last August.

Oh yeah one more thing.  Great micro brews.  See where my priorities are."}
{"text":"I am a bit shocked to see all of these negative reviews here...

My first experience at Blue Water Tavern was a gamble. I was trying to find somewhere in Pittsburgh that had outdoor seating to accommodate at least 15 people for my birthday, and not only were they more than happy to, the patio is great! Fearful of being stuck inside after a heavy summer storm, we showed up to find that the patio is nicely covered. Our server, William, was wonderful; great attitude and he was on top of keeping the drinks coming all night. He also split our 16-party check without pause. 

I ordered the Mediterranean pasta with chicken - it was amazing; a perfect summer dish. We also ordered the Tavern Trio of hummus, crab stuffed portabella, and thai chicken satays: all tasty and just the right size.

Everyone got the food they ordered, cooked as requested. Bouns points: when the manager decided that two of the dishes' portions were too small (they were training a new chef that week), he brought out two more, \"correctly\" sized dishes. It's one thing to have a couple of learning curve mistakes; but it's a whole new level when errors are righted without question.

We had such an amazing, fun, delicious night, that my fiancee and I went back a few weeks later for date night. This time, I ordered the Crab a la Vodka. There were huge hunks of crab throughout - more than enough - and the veggies we cooked perfectly. Again, we had great service and even some craft beer samplings, as the manager remembered us from before.

We will continue to frequent the Blue Water Tavern, and to recommend it to our friends and neighbors!"}
{"text":"Was in the plaza where Blue Water is (was) located last week.
The location is now empty.........as in................CLOSED.
Signage there indicates there will be another restaurant opening in the same location next month (Oct 2011).  Don't know if it will be under the same ownership or not.
btw, the Blue Water website is still up, with NO mention that the restaurant has closed.  How nice of them to let people know."}
{"text":"As a citizen of a country that is (for better or worse) known for it's love of hamburgers, why do so many places serve such terrible examples of America's favorite past time?  Honestly, I was just in the mood for a burger and decided to try Blue Water Tavern's Smokehouse Burger.  Very typical and easy entree to accomplish.  First off, as soon as I see a uniform patty, I am turned off.  The burger was greasy and had no taste....at all.  The bacon was greasy and had no taste at all.  (How does bacon not taste good!?)  The cheddar cheese was barely there, looked plastic, and had no taste.  There was barely any bbq sauce on the burger and it was also without taste.  The fried onion was not on the burger, and I did not really worry about it considering the fact that fried onion was not going to save this burger.  And those are not fresh cut fries.  If your ingredients are so cheap and bad that you cannot pull off a bbq bacon cheeseburger, then I believe that it is a safe guess that the rest of the food is cheap and bad as well.  It is a shame considering I would have wanted to go back to try some of the more interesting menu item like Lobster and Shrimp Mac and Cheese."}
{"text":"My experience was nothing like the negative ones of the previous reviewers.  We had 8 people in our party, 4 of them kids, and we were treated well.  We were in a hurry and the server got us our food quickly and correctly.  Even brought the kids' food out first to keep them happy.  I enjoyed the Pittsburger; everyone else enjoyed their food as well."}
{"text":"It was a Thursday afternoon around 2 and I was on my way to Smokey Bones in Cranberry. I caught the Blue Water Tavern sign out of the corner of my eye and decided to give it a try. My visions of a tavern lunch were soon quashed as I walked in and there was absolutely nothing \"Tavern\" about it. \"Grille\", perhaps. Tavern? Hardly.(-1)
 There was a couple good beers and I had a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I had to ask for a glass for. Bartenders need to start paying attention to their craft, bottled beer should always come with a glass(-1). There seemed to be plenty of wines, tho, another mark towards the Grille moniker opposed to Tavern. The menu had no real standouts or appetizers, well I think they were camouflaged as \"Tapas\".. But, at $10 each I really didn't want a $20 lunch. I ended up going with the Buffalo Chicken sandwich and \"Fresh, Handcut\" fries. After I ordered, I sat and checked in on FourSquare and yelp on my phone and started reading the reviews. For a second I thought about just paying for the beer and leaving, the reviews were making me think I had made a mistake. This made me dread my decision staying(-1 negative publicity).
 My meal came promptly and I got a good laugh at the 9, yes nine, French Fries in all their Fresh glory. The sandwich was a good size and for as cheap as potatoes are, they really wasted a chance to fill out the plate a little for next to nothing and send the customer home full for less than 18 cents.(-1) It was a heavy hand that dealt the seasoned salt onto the fried potato, but they did taste good.The Buffalo Chicken sandwich tasted good,(+1) but the roll was fresh and soft and the sauce soaked in and made it soggy. If the bun was toasted, it would have been perfect.(-1)  I feel sandwiches that are \"hot\" should come with toasted bread, anyways.
I laid a 20 up and the bartender gave me back 3 dollars and change. And I thought, wait, a sandwich, 9 fries and a beer. 6 dollars for the Dogfish Head. Now I know its not Bud or Miller Lite, but I drink it all the time and it's usually between 4 and 5 bucks. There is nothing there that makes this beer worth 6 dollars, that I had to beg for a glass for.(-1)
I left a faux tavern hungry and disappointed, o wait, I knew it was going to be bad..I would give them No Stars and suggest eating at Sheetz across the street."}
{"text":"Hard to believe that after a 1 star experience the first time, that we would be brave enough to return. But we decided to give Blue Water another chance. 

We were greeted promptly by the host staff and requested a booth. We were told that none were available, but were seated next to an empty booth that remained empty for our entire meal. Oh, okay. Ha ha. You had a reservation perhaps that didn't show? Come on. 

BJ decided to give a burger a try. He ordered the Bayou Bleu burger. \"It's my favorite,\" proclaimed our inefficient server. Should have taken that as a warning. BJ asked for a small side salad as a substitute to the fries. \"No, we can't do that, you have to pick another side\". Come on, you can't substitute a couple pieces of lettuce and a smidgen of dressing? Even for an up charge? Glad we decided to come here, again. BJ opted for asparagus. Of course, his burger arrived with fries. I asked him later how his burger was and he said it was the worst hamburger ever. Totally lacking any flavor.  Even the bacon.  (Just a side note, go to Wendy's and get the new Bacon & Blue.  That burger is 50 X's better.)

I ordered a crab cake appetizer for my meal, since it wasn't offered an an entree with a side of asparagus and a side salad. The memorable salad from our previous visit was not so great. Pinenuts showed up in place of hazel nuts, the lettuce was not fresh and the spicy soy vinaigrette had the consistency of water. Also, my jumbo lump crab cakes had very little jumbo lump crab. I also asked for some extra remoulade to try to cover them up. Our server brought out  soy dressing. When I told her that's not what I asked for, she actually argued with me and told me that's what the crab cakes were served with. Are you kidding me? Sorry to say, we will not return."}
{"text":"I wish I had read these reviews before deciding to give Blue Water a try :(  I also wish that I was the kind of person who nominated restaurants to Gordon Ramsey's show where he shamelessly teaches restauranteurs what it takes to make a successful and memorable dining experience  

The first bad sign was the caesar salad.  The dressing tasted as if it was straight out of the Kraft bottle- absolutely nothing fun about it, literally lettuce and a few shaving of cheese.  We opted for the Crab a la Vodka and the prime rib special.  Neither had much flavor.  The crab dish was screaming for salt and although there were huge pieces of crab on top, the dish was very bland and what flavors did come through were not complimentary.  I hate to say it but I wish we had gone to Bravo's."}
{"text":"The previous poster has a lot of good points. The food is very inconsistent here. I've been to BWT three times but only because coworkers choose to go there for lunch. 

First experience - no pizza. They forgot to thaw the dough. Already disappointed, I ordered a burger. With the exception of the truffle mayo it was boring and bland. 

Second trip - we finally got the pizza.  Our server recommended the wild mushroom. Again, bland - even with an assortment of mushrooms. The seafood pizza was decent but it's no longer on the menu. 

Last trip - grilled veggie sandwich and salad. First, the bread was way too wimpy for the sandwich. It was basically toasted white bread. The cheese was wrong too. It was melted into a blob and had no taste. The veggies were grilled but had no seasoning. There was even a stewed tomato slapped on there. 
The salad was ok but the menu says Asian pears and they used plain old bartletts. Who are they fooling!?"}
